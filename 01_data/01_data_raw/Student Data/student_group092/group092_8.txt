<rate>4<//rate><review>It’s a family owned and operated business which is great! We did the Cupid’s escape room (seasonal for Valentine’s Day). I thought it was just okay. It was a shorter and easier version then I guess their hour long rooms. But for $15 it wasn’t bad. I would be willing to try one of their hour long rooms to see if they’re any better.<//review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPLbDI109xJuBMAlxteabp-J8fRT1w1M80ZDXG0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< Resp>

Impossible Escape has 3 super awesome rooms, they change up every so often. The staff is so nice and hardworking, they really make the experience special for everyone. The rooms are so detailed and the puzzles are all so awesome. The building itself is very nice and clean, decorated for holidays! Would definitely recommend it to anyone who loves escape rooms.</Text>

This was my first escape this experience and I had a blast !!! It’s so crazy because all clues are right there in front of you but at the same time so hard to find. This is a great family fun or a group of friends adventure. Will definitely be back to try Mosi’s curse. Staff was super cool thanks again.< /text>

Went to impossible escape a bit ago, and it was so much fun I did it with my siblings and we actually escaped the Triton room. There are three rooms and they all have interesting clues, plus they’re selling merch as well.< /review>

SAVE YOUR MONEY DO NOT COME HERE. Me and my friends have been to 25+ escape rooms and this is by far the worst experience. The lady in front is rude, puzzles were misplaced, she complained because we needed to use the restroom and said “it was going to be a long night” She made it clear when we got there that she was just about to clock out. A friend got in contact with the owner and it wasn’t any better. TERRIBLE MANAGEMENT. They need to shadow other escape rooms, to learn how they should treat customers.</review>

WOULD NOT RECOMEND
I was really disappointed by this escape room and the way they treated us. Me and a couple of friends went there one night after a party it was right before they closed, as soon as we entered the establishment the "assistant manager" said in a rude attitude "I was literally about to clock out" she asked why we were there and when we told her that we had left a boring party the attitude was even worse, she made an assumption about us being drunk and then got irritated when we had to use the restroom, all the escape rooms I've been to never complained that we all needed to use the bathroom.

The rooms were not ready and  things were misplaced, locks were open and she seemed to be taking it out on us she would hesitated to give us hints. we stopped playing the game and asked for a refund bc it was not enjoyable it was quite awkward and uncomfortable, she called the manager and said he'd get in contact with us, when we exited the building we saw her stomping around on the phone and looking outside at us, very unprofessional.

The owner got in contact with my friend who purchased the tickets and said she'd get a refund and a free game but then never responded, we did get the refund but still no answer on a free game, not that we would waste our time going again.

**Thank you for proving my point with your response, VERY unprofessional. Learn to take responsibility for your actions, my friend called multiple times and didn't get an answer and never received a call back. POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE.<//text>

This was the worst Escape Room experience we ve ever had.... we played all 3 rooms. Of the 3, 2 had puzzles that were broken or missing pieces. Staff just shrugged and moved on.  In one room the staff member said “yeah.. we know this one has issues. We re redoing it because of them.” But just moved on when we mentioned the puzzles that didn’t work.
The clues were pointless and unhelpful.  We ve played over 100 rooms in various states and ability levels. We are not inexperienced players. These rooms were awful.  I don’t care if I win or lose, but these were so poorly done they weren’t even fun, which is to bad.  For the cost of the game we expected way better.<//text>

<Review>This escape room is great.  The rooms are very well decorated and set up.  The people there are very friendly and helpful.  The Triton was really cool, and seems like you  really are I a submarine.

This was our second time coming to Escape this. We range in age from 12 to 63 years old. What an amazing way for family and friends fun. We had family from New Jersey who have done many escapes. They rated this one the best. No one was disappointed< /text>

<Review>We had a large group that we split into two teams. Both rooms were tons of fun, they both included different types of puzzles and required team work to complete. The staff working was also great. I would definitely recommend this place for a fun date night or even a family outing.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>{'time': 1581027379928, 'text': 'Thank you, glad the group had fun'}</resp>< GmapID>

You can honestly tell that this is a labor of love for them: every rivet, panel and screw of the room we did was obviously created with love and care. The staff was so excited to engage with us about the room that we felt almost like they were playing with us.

My experience at Escape This was very good. I enjoy doing escape rooms with friends and what better than to do one down the street from where you live. The prices aren't too expensive. The rooms are some what challenging and there are only 3 escape rooms to choose from. The only issue I had during my experience was having too many people in our group. We had a group of 3 to start out with and we were paired up with another group of 5 to do the escape room. For me that was too many people for an escape room and it took alot of the fun out of the room because there were 8 of us. Other than that I had a fun time.<//text>

My family and I have been here twice now. The first time we were not able to escape (casino room) but then we were able to get out of the second one (Mosi's Curse, which is leaving early 2020). It was fun! I think the first time was definitely a learning experience, so if you don't escape, definitely try again!< /review>

Did an escape room here for the first time tonight. Really well-designed room, lots of great puzzles and a great time was had by all. It it was just my wife and I, and we were able to escape the room with less than two minutes left. The design was really good and a lot of thought went into the puzzles. Also a lot of high-tech gadgets and cool props. Definitely recommend this place for either the grizzled veteran or the new comer to escape rooms</Text>

We spent the first 20 minutes walking in circles. So that definitely drops group morale. You only get clues if the whole team agrees on requesting one.  Getting everyone to agree is not always easy when you have a bigger group. Besides that we had fun once things started to click. We escaped the room, staff was friendly.

We have been to several escape rooms in Pomona/Ontario and in Arizona and I was skeptical this one would be as good. I was pleasantly surprised by the thought-out puzzles. They're not too difficult (we did it with two people) and had 8:20 to spare in the end in the Mayan style room. Although I do think they have some room to grow with the materials of their props I thought they did a great job in this space, some were just a little beat up from lots of use. We would go back to do the other room, The Royal Suite. I would recommend it to friends in the area. It's also not scary so I would feel comfortable taking kids (although there is a skeleton and a body).<//review>

This place is such a fun experience.  You can take kids or just adults.  This would be a great place to take a date.  It was a little difficult to figure out all the clues and the time limit made it even more exciting.<//Review>

My first time experience with an escape room, and this place nailed it for a first timer.. it was exciting interactive, and we escaped. My group escaped the Mosi's Curse which has an escape rate of 48% on their website, so I feel pretty good about it lol. The staff was super cool.<//text>

<review>Escape This, was great. Took our daughter and her boyfriend, such a wonderfully planned escape room. Thisnwas our first time Doing anything like this. I would definitely recommend for families to go it's a great time everybody had use teamwork trying to figure out how to escape I can't wait until November when they open up the 2nd room. A must go for anybody living in the high desert or anybody just visiting make your reservations today . The owners Wes & Michelle were simply great. Down to earth. Well put together.</review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

My wife and I just moved to Elk Grove and we have found our dentist. From the very beginning they were very professional, detail oriented, respectful, and knowledgeable. From the moment you walk in until you walk out, it is a great environment. The thoroughness of the entire process was comforting. Very upfront with cost. Staff is very friendly. They do great work, very gentle hands,  and the results are great. We recommended them to all.</text>

<review>I am 56 years old and have been to multiple dentist over the years. I want to say this is the best dentist office I have ever been to. They are honest and do not sell you service you don't need. Dr. Fouladi is the best dentist I have ever visited and is very gentle. I highly recommend Elk Grove Family Dentistry.

They have meticulously set up and prepared the office to maintain an organized workflow and clean environment during the current pandemic.  I loved waiting in my car rather than in the waiting room waiting for their call.  (It did not take long) I would almost prefer it this way regardless of the pandemic!  As always a very cheerful and happy staff.< /review>

I was very impressed with all of the changes Elk Grove Family Dentistry has made to keep us all safe during their reopening post COVID closure. I waited in my car until I was told to come up for my appointment, which made me feel very safe and was amazing for social distancing from other patients. They took my temperature, asked me health and travel questions, and I did a mouth rinse when I entered. Everyone had extra protective gear on since my last visit and I felt very well taken care of and protected. As a plus my teeth feel so clean!  Thanks Abby my hygienist, she was great!!  I left feeling very happy that I not only was able to have my teeth cleaned but that my entire visit felt safe and thought out with all of us patients in mind.< /Review>

<text>My family and I have been going to Elk Grove Family Dentistry since we moved here in 2014.  We have lived in other states and countries and have experienced dentistry of varying quality and caliber.
At Elk Grove Family Dentistry we are greeted promptly and treated graciously. We do not wait long before we are seen.  With COVID19 they have put extensive safety processes in place: Extra air filters, distancing, face shields, gloves and masks.   They are not part of our insurance plans approved list of dentists.  When we first arrived we went to a couple of the dentists that were approved and were disappointed in the way they did business.  If you want caring attention to detail, friendly service, people that listen whether it is a technician, dentist or front office staff, this is the place to go.< /text>< pictures>

My visit was so nice. I had my teeth cleaned and xrays.  The staff was great and very professional. Julie took the time to answer all my questions and asked if I was in any pain. Pain free cleaning. Something I haven't been able to say about my last hygienist. Dr. Came in and was so kind also. They really care about their patients.  Very gentle hands. I felt very comfortable the whole visit. Thank you Julie for the great experience, and to everyone in the office.</text>

Honestly, I am an Army Brat, having lived in 6 different states, and some of them twice, I have seen a lot of dentists. From the creepy dental farms to the local singular dentist. Elk Grove Family Dental has been the best experience yet. For many reasons, but if you need one, they actually remembered or noted that it takes me awhile to get numb following my initial visit to establish care.

I always get drilled too early. I went to get a cleaning and a few old filling re-filled during my first ACTUAL visit to Elk Grove Family Dental, post establishing care. With out reminder, they shot me part way through my cleaning (and it was painless-ish) giving me ample time to get numb.

If you need more reasons to go, they remembered all my family, where I went to school and related to me my entire visit.

I just moved to Elk Grove in April 2020, a midst Covid 19 and so far, sadly, Elk Grove Family Dental has been one of the brighter spots.</Review>

<Text>Best move I made! Our kids have great experiences with all staff, hygienists and dentists, being an EG Native we were always with Dr. Bell had a few hiccups after he retired trying to find the right place for our family and this place is definitely it! Thank you for always taking such great, detailed care of the entire family.< /Text>< rating>

I loved my visit to Dr. Rollofson! The office is equipped with all the latest technology which I appreciate, and the staff is just the friendliest. My hygienist Jackie was so thorough and did a great job explaining what each step she was doing is for. Dr. Rollofson came to check in on my teeth to make sure there were no major issues- I appreciate that she took the time to do that! My teeth have never felt cleaner and I have the amazing team at Elk Grove Family Dentistry to thank for that:)< /Review>

<review>Awesome, awesome, awesome! I had a great experience today. I had two crowns done at 7am and I thought I would never say it was “no problem at all.” I always seem to have a little anxiety at the dentist but I didn’t today it was over in a flash! Also, the staff were so organized and I felt safe and secure with all their new procedures regarding COVID. Thank you to the crew and Dr. Rollofson “YOU ROCK!!”</review>< name>

<Review>I have always thought Elk Grove Family Dental is a great place. Today I had an opportunity to visit (first time since COVID re-opening) and was hugely impressed by how the practice is handling patient/provider safety and well-being with the many additional guidelines they’ve been given. I drove up, waited minimal time to be called in and took a short survey and temperature check before my  appointment. As always, the dentists, hygienists and assistants are attentive and gentle.  I consistently receive top-quality dental care at EGFD.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

My families been coming here for years, and love everything about this dental office. Now that they have reopened due to COVID-19, Dr Rollofson has gone above and beyond to assure her staff and patients are safe. Also, Jackie does a wonderful job cleaning our teeth, and is always so kind.

I have severe dental anxiety. Christy and her team are always so considerate and make me feel the most calm of any dental office I’ve ever used. I live 45 minutes away, and I commute to this office. That says a lot. Elk Grove Family Dentistry most definitely deserves a 5 star rating!</review>

Elk Grove Family Dentistry is the best.  I have been coming here for about 7 years now, after going to a dentist who seemed to over-diagnose and who, we later realized, may have been over charging our insurance.  I have TMJ disorder and would always get really nervous for my dental appointments.  One appointment with Elk Grove Family Dentistry, and all the nerves have faded away.  They do fast work, but it is thorough and high quality.  Everybody is so friendly, too.  I just got back from my first appointment since the COVID-19 pandemic, and their precautions helped me to feel safe, and to feel confident that Elk Grove Family Dentistry values the safety of its patients, and its staff.< /Text>

Going to the dentist during Covid-19 gave me a bit of concern but they are doing everything right! Masks, hand sanitizer,  temperature checks, room air purifiers and modified services to make sure everyone stays safe! Thanks, ladies!!</Text>

The entire staff is wonderful and helpful. It starts with the front desk as they greet you and make you feel comfortable the moment you walk in . I have had multiple visits in the last few months to prepare for my crown replacement. My initial visit was for a clean, which led to a deep clean ☹️ But Jackie did an amazing job with the gum clean and getting my gums healthy again ( Flossing and I don’t see eye to eye)
My most recent visit, I  had my crowns replaced and I am very satisfied with my new million dollar smile🤑Dr. Rollofsen and Stacie did and amazing job during my visits . Stacie made temporary crowns that looked just as good as permanent crowns and they held up to the test . They told me to be careful and stay away from certain foods (Ribs, steak) while wearing temporary crowns , I didn’t listen and I had no issues with the temporary crowns . Great Job stacie!!! Dr. Rollofsen, ensured the crowns were to my liking
( shade of the crown , crown length, and fitting of crown) and ensured I was 100% satisfied before leaving . Overall , it was a great experience and I Will highly  recommend ELK GROVE FAMILY DENTISTRY to everyone ..GREAT WORK LADIES !!!</review>

And a nice lobby to hangout, with trees and benches to sit.
Issues:
Only complaint is one of the benches are rotting out

I had a wonderful experience at Elk Grove Dentistry. From the front desk staff all the way through the end of my visit, people were friendly, helpful and enthusiastic.  And they were very concerned with my comfort and satisfaction.

Dr. Sandretti is an awesome dentist! She is personable and highly skilled. She let me know exactly what to expect, and did a wonderful job repairing a cracked tooth that was causing me tremendous problems.  Now that tooth is literally better than new! I highly recommend Dr. Sandretti to anyone needing dental care

Jackie, the Dental Hygienist at Elk Grove Dentistry was also wonderful.  My teeth never felt so clean!

They have a fantastic team.</review>

Amazing Staff! Family of 6 and we all adore them. I’m very fearful of dentists, but they haven’t hurt me yet! I’ve had a lot of work done, very pleased with them from A-Z.</Text>

I can’t say enough good things about Elk Grove Family Dentistry. I was in severe pain and they saw me immediately, conducting numerous tests to diagnose the issue. Dr. Sandretti was so kind and explained everything so clearly and answered alll of my questions, sometimes more than once.  I highly recommend this office!!< /Review>

Dr. Phen....the best dentist since my family dentist whom I used since I was 5, and we used him since I was 28ish? He retired and he was so good. Shamefully I hadn't seen a dentist in a long while... My boyfriend found Dr. Phen, and now I have found my dentist. I had a root canal today and it was amazing. I'd drive 2 hours for this man. He treats his staff amazingly and it's nice hearing their silly banter while in treatment. What a great group of people. If you're in a financial jam they will also work with you, and they're always careing. I love them!< /Text>

When Anya answered the call and put me in the very next day, wow, that was amazing.  When I arrived I met Dr. Rollofson and the rest of the staff!  They actually give you a little tour of the place!  I was proceeding with my consultation, Dr. Rollofson made me feel wonderful about myself and the situation.  She actually cares about what YOU want out of the treatments long term.  Everyone really cares about you as a person!  Your not just another set of teeth!  My Teen boys now go to her!  I am so lucky to be a part of this practice!</Review>< pics>

<Review>Love this dental office! Staff is great, and friendly. Received a check up from dr Rollofson and a cleaning from Julie. Cleaning was great. This office is taking all available precautions to keep us as safe as possible with covid-19. They sterilize everything between patients and where full protective gear. One person at a time in the wait room. Temp and med screen before you come back. Stylish barriers for lady’s behind desk. Totally recommend this office to everyone. Amid our situation they are doing everything they can to keep your mouth clean!< /Review><time>1589501336180</time></record>

<review>I have been driving to the Bay Area for the last three years to go to my dentist. I was terrified of changing to someone new. After my dental hygienist that I had forever moved away, I knew it was time to give up the two and a half hour drive and find a new dental office. I am so picky, i just kept putting it off. Finally, a friend who is as picky as I am, told me about Dr Rollofson and Elk Grove Family Dentistry.
I am happy to say, I have found my forever dentist. Dr Rolloffson is kind, thorough, honest and very clear when she explains what needs to be done.
The office is bright and open, with a very up and positive vibe.
The entire staff is phenomenal, all female, all friendly and they all made me feel like I was welcome to their family.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>{'time': 1533910692107, 'text': 'We are so lucky to have new patients like you!

In a few words……This dental office “ROCKS”.
From the staff to Christy herself the whole Team is just awesome.  I broke a front tooth on a Monday afternoon 3 days before leaving for a convention and she got me in, gave me options and corrected the issue so that I could go and not look funny with half a front tooth.  I would drive many miles to see her and that is nothing I’ve ever said about a dentist!!<//review>

While I prefer to see her exclusively I have had the occasion to be seen by others of her staff while she was on maternity leave.  The office is up to date, even has a chair that massages you....nice touch.  The staff is incredibly friendly from the front desk folks to the hygienists to the dentists.  I have a very sensitive mouth when it comes to cold water/air.  They understand that and have always made whatever accommodations are necessary to make sure they minimize my discomfort, and have always succeeded in that effort.  I have never felt like they tried to hard sell me on anything like another reviewer mentioned. I have always felt like they are genuinely concerned with the health of my teeth and gums. You won't be dissapointed by trusting them with your dental needs.</review><date>1457540376810</date><gmap_id>0x809ac744989d3fab:0x49264d67dba6349e<//gmap_id>< response>

All day I have been searching for the right dentist. Unfortunately this facility doesn't take my insurance however the receptionist Tiffany  (It's her first day 🙄) helped me soooo much, and was so very polite. If the other staff and dentist are anything like Tiffany this is definitely the place to be.</text>

The customer service is great.  I would like for the employees to be a little more professional and maybe not have personal conversations while they’re helping me, but I understand that they’re young so it’s gonna happen.  I don’t like their portions.  I get the Togo sizes a lot and they’re never filled.<//text>

The ice cream is great (obviously) but Bianca was not friendly at all. She might have been having a bad day but there were only 2 customers so I don’t know why she had to have attitude...</review>

When you merely walk near a Cold Stone store you can always tell it's near...
This place is one of the best smelling establishments ever!
The stone is a pretty good gimmick, but the taste cannot be denied. So  many different flavors and toppings to choose from.
I usually go with sweet cream and fruits, but this is a place where you could have a lot of fun and create your own taste.
I will always highly recommend Cold Stone.<//text>

Cold stone is always a delicious treat but this trip wad especially good because the young man who was working,  I think his name was Marcus, was extremely professional, courteous, helpful, energetic, knowledgeable, and kind. We will return to this cold stone because of him! I hope he gets recognition for his hard work!<//text>

A great cold stone franchise. The workers work hard mixing that delicious ice cream. Did you know they make their ice cream on site? Waffle cones too? Quality ice cream with hard working employees. Never had a problem and enjoy all those delicious calories. Cake batter is amazing and my favorite. 5/7 stars</review>

Two employees present at the store but only one (Stephanie) was serving the customers while the other was doing other things behind the counter.

Oh yum! Oh heaven from the heat outside... need I say more? Choose a special; create a special. Choose a small cup just to quench your drooling desires, and then choose an even bigger cup to take home. Great service with a smile.<//Text>

The service was really awesome! Both of the workers were very friendly and helpful! The one problem I have with this place is there was no option to tip on the receipt. I hate businesses that won't allow us to tip. If you aren't doing right by your employees I won't be a repeat customer...< /Text>

I'm a frequent customer here and a long time customer of this chain and this location does not disappoint. Parking is limited on site but there is an open air seating area for all of the restaurants in this area.< /review>

<review>Everyone is great, BUT- everytime I go in, no matter when, this place smells like sour milk. A really strong smell. Not good when you are there because you crave dessert- by the time I get to the counter, I'm not so eager to eat anything from there. Makes me wonder if the refrigeration system is keeping things cold enough? I was craving ice cream tonight and thought about going to ColdStone, but then decided I really couldn't handle that smell again and decided not to go.< /review>< pictures>

Went in early afternoon after lunch and the place smelled AWFUL.  My husband and I noticed it and I rationalized that it smelled like they used an old nasty mop head and that it probably wasn't indicative of bad food.  Then we proceeded to wait for 5 minutes at the counter with no sign of anyone to help us.  Eventually the awful smell got to both of us and there was no way we could have stayed and enjoyed our ice cream, assuming someone would have been there to help us. We left and will probably never go back.< /Text>

<Review>So i just left this shop ...and the girl who was helping had extremely bad customer service ..she was a young girl with a big bun i didnt get her name..but her attitude was very unpleasant ...not welcoming at all. You could just tell she hated her job .. Store could def use customer service classes< /Review>< pics>

SO happy that I found this place during quarantine. I saw a photo of their cheong fun on instagram and was excited that this place was located near me. I've been here countless times since prices are cheap and affordable. They're fast and the food tastes great. Should note that they take cash only, but I think they accept venmo as well. I've tried their cheong fun with shrimp, beef, egg and corn, and liver. All of them have been great and I love this style of cheong fun, where the toppings are on top, rather than inside. I've also tried their pan fried noodles. They kept the sauce and noodles separate which I greatly appreciated. The noodles were fresh and super crispy. Their salt and pepper wings are also full of flavor and a great snack. I would highly  recommend this place!<//review>

Cash only to be prepped and brought over!

I haven't had Hong Kong cafe grub food for days and this simply just hits the spot!

Their rice noodle rolls are delicious and so fresh with complimenting squishable bottled sweet soy sauce to go squirt all over it!  They have many fillings to choose from and my favorite was the shrimp and beef!

They have the signature stir fried dishes that's superbly bomb and homely!  Picture foods on the wall to choose from.

Hong Kong iced milk tea for the refreshing win!

I was in a happy place grubbing and munching!< /review>

<text>New establishment located on Ocean Avenue near 24 Hour gym and next to Emma's restaurant. There rice porridge/ conger is pretty good. Size is personal sized for all porridge items. Their rice noodles are really good in terms of freshness and how customizable they are.  Service was alright, slightly lacking in terms of paying more attention to customers. The interior is quite clean, but the restroom (one, unisex) can use some TLC... Heh. Prices are descent.<//text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPYM6zJSETmF9Lx3BmJRb099bsNX8mf-HfYsVYI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMEp1TiWVB8J1sWwsEvTHczuOr9pe7i5r6qk603=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPVCNRFYcVgnFL8NusHdhQLkMA9cnehU5H-t0m5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNAPO8tbjMrakix-f0P3SguxDX8RXYZAcUFgCVp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPgR6ybNPvnyYVbBmCJw5ZZ8KGDxAfoBhZXwk7L=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPRtf4bM6lvSrM4sdqbMTjM6jjJKSJWlCs04ZXX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOe6H2_jpansy0f650GNNGA3l1BJN5tt6d5W6Vy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMJHrvce9VjbzDsv5xtg02BY40WAul_-dpooxLD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNcGti1jG6FD4trOjsBRmWZuda4_bGPFCV6FhxO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPBy4DSsQfIlK2EV7sTt2E3QbsUjYTy12tUUeQN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPVCPEpHvaE79FK8iFQYumA-azFaPuzejzXfGzt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

We live in spring valley and are willing to drive to lucky Chinese food. The service is good. The food is delicious and hands down they have the cleanest bathroom i have ever been in a restaurant. The prices are OK a little pricey but its worth it. We found another place to satisfy our Chinese food cravings.< /Review>

HUGE portions of food! Pricing is good too. If you’re looking for lunch and dinner come to this place as one portion will last two meals if you’re a sensible eater. Or scarf it down if you’re super hungry.

This is your typical greasy spoon Chinese restaurant that has all the classic dishes. They even have porridge and soup available.

Service was quick and everyone was super friendly. Nice family run place.< /Review>

I paid my $90 check with credit card and put the tips in cash under the check and the Server didn't see it and chase me outside to tell me to tip her.

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><review>Come for their steamed rice rolls - truly, second to none in my opinion. Its silky and soft, not overdone, and can be "customized" to your liking. Admittedly, they aren't as "pretty" as dim sum restaurants.

Everything else we had was fairly standard. The seafood pan fried noodles had a fair amount of seafood, but not great quality. They also put way too much gravy in my opinion. The porridge was also good, not too watery, not too thick. Portion size would be right for about 2.</review>< user>

They have some really good chicken wings...but they are always closed when their business hours says their open. It happens more  often then not. This is a new business  so you would think  that they would want to be consistent to build a clientele.<//Review>

More recent remodel from the original opening photos and different than the reviews for the old Joes Chinese food of many years ago. Decent food, value is good. Prices are right. It's where local Chinese in the neighborhood go to for some cheap eats. Service relatively fast. They're more known for their Special Rice Noodles which are made here. Fairly busy and seems to be a completely different scene of when it first opened or when it was the previous restaurant here.<//review>

<Review>My friends and I ordered delivery from here and it took what seems like forever.  Although most of what we ordered was pretty good (namely the crab rangoons, veggie pot stickers, and shrimp fried rice) they forgot our orange chicken, and well, that is just unforgivable! Maybe it doesn't matter because the crispy fried ginger chicken that we did get was weird, dry, and gross.  I just wish we didn't waste our money on ordering the chicken dishes, but everything else was okay.< /Review>< pictures>

<review>I'm not gonna front. This place is cheeks. And not the ones on your face. Dead fish in the fish tank. Raw meat laid upon patron tables being handled by uncovered hands. Dirty dingy carpeting. Gum stuck to tables.Boxes piled up. Mildew. The place is buzzing with flies. I've been here more than once and the flies are always there. Flies don't have a long life span so I'm sure there is a constant egg laying, maggot festering pool of sludgy rotted food somewhere that gives them a secure stable of breeding ground. This place is simply put gross. The owner is a selfish prick, who was bold enough to tell me I was lying when I told him my food was soggy and cold, and refused to refund me my money until i put up a relentless fight. I recommend this place to nobody. It deserves to fail and sink into oblivion on the sole fact alone that they give no care into how their food is handled or how their restaurant is displayed. The quality of the food is decent at best. but seeing how they handle it and the sanitary levels of the place will gross you out beyond belief you have to give is a poor score. I will return only to snap photos and upload them to quell the nay sayers.</review>< pictures>

<review>I'm not gonna front. This place is cheeks. And not the ones on your face. Dead fish in the fish tank. Raw meat laid upon patron tables being handled by uncovered hands. Dirty dingy carpeting. Gum stuck to tables.Boxes piled up. Mildew. The place is buzzing with flies. I've been here more than once and the flies are always there. Flies don't have a long life span so I'm sure there is a constant egg laying, maggot festering pool of sludgy rotted food somewhere that gives them a secure stable of breeding ground. This place is simply put gross. The owner is a selfish prick, who was bold enough to tell me I was lying when I told him my food was soggy and cold, and refused to refund me my money until i put up a relentless fight. I recommend this place to nobody. It deserves to fail and sink into oblivion on the sole fact alone that they give no care into how their food is handled or how their restaurant is displayed. The quality of the food is decent at best. but seeing how they handle it and the sanitary levels of the place will gross you out beyond belief you have to give is a poor score. I will return only to snap photos and upload them to quell the nay sayers.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<Date>1517355232935< /Date><Name>Cynthia K<//Name><Review>It was my first time trying this place out today . I went with my husband , my 1 yr old and my parents . Total of 4 adults and 1 baby. I was trying to ask for replenish the tea. Usually in a chinese resturant, when the lid is open , we r asking for refill on the tea. Since our teapot lid was open for some time and they still haven’t refill our tea, so I tried to wave them down to ask for refills. I yelled so loud that other tables were looking . Waiters were still ignoring me. So I open n close the teapot lid constantly to make a sound until they can hear me. Until the waiters acknowledged. When we got our bill, 15% tips were already added to the total. $65.47. We put down $65 cash. After leaving the restaurant, someone from the restaurant rushed out telling us we didn’t pay in full! So I responded her , 47 cents of tips , u asking us on 47 cents and tips is now required when we have less than 7 ppl.
Food was bad , $12.99 for a small portion of stir fried noodle . My conclusion is I will not recommend anyone going to this place , food was bad , service was bad .<//Review>< gmap_id>

Been here twice. First time the waitress forgot my order. The food is nothing special. If you're expecting panda express\ Americanize Chinese food eg. Chop suey, orange chicken, I recommend you look elsewhere. The food here is remanicent to the street cantinas of China, like those that are open after 12pm. The speciality is congee, but even that isn't that great. Don't rely on the pictures either as they as stock photos from elsewhere. In short, don't come here for good American Chinese food and don't expect high quality traditional Chinese food either.</review>

<response>None<//response><Text>(Translated by Google) Boss, Thanksgiving, write a heartfelt evaluation: authentic. It also confirms that sentence, you have to find 3-4 stars for Chinese food in the Bay Area, but I can rest assured that I will give you five stars when I see your stable output.

To be true, the food I have eaten in these past two days:
Authentic: dry fried Niuhe (cheap portion is authentic without explanation); Yangzhou fried rice (cheap portion is authentic without explanation); soy milk, deep-fried dough sticks (not so cheap, portion is authentic without explanation); shredded chicken (not so cheap, portion is authentic) Don't explain) Congee with preserved eggs and lean meat
Not too authentic-(green) salt and pepper chicken wings, theoretically (black) salt and pepper chicken wings. But it's delicious.
It doesn't matter the truth: rice rolls, also called rolls. If you know these two names, you can take a look at them. If you don’t know, you can try :)

Many pictures of yelp can be found.

Boss, I hope you keep exporting high-quality and delicious dishes!

老板，感恩节了，写个衷心的评价：：地道。也印证了那句话，湾区吃中餐得找3-4星的，但是我见您稳定输出，也就放心给您五星了。

保证真实，这两天我外卖吃过的菜：
地道：干炒牛河（便宜分量足地道不解释）；扬州炒饭（便宜分量足地道不解释）；豆浆、油条（不太便宜分量足地道不解释）；手撕鸡（不太便宜分量足地道不解释）皮蛋瘦肉粥（便宜分量足地道不解释）
不太地道 - （青）椒盐鸡翅，理论上应该是（黑）椒盐鸡翅。不过也挺好吃。
无所谓真实：肠粉，也叫卷筒粉。如果你知道这两名字，就可以来回味一下。如果不知道，可尝试 ：）

图片yelp很多可找来看看。

老板，希望您保持输出优质好吃的菜！<//Text><userid>112597139718214351508< /userid>< Rate>

(Translated by Google) This restaurant is special and looks ordinary. In fact, many Chinese people can taste traditional Chinese food in the United States. Very rare, it should be said that this restaurant in the United States is the first restaurant. very good. Unique. Awesome

这餐馆好特别，看上去好普通，其实有很多中国人在美国能品尝到中国的传统食物。非常的稀罕，应该说是在美国开展这饮食餐馆是首一餐馆。非常的好。独一无二的。棒棒哒👍</Text>

(Translated by Google) I called to take out this morning! There are preserved egg lean meat porridge / pork roasted rice noodles / beef rice noodles / fritters / soy milk! When I parked the car on the roadside and prepared to take out the takeout card, I ordered another beef intestine powder. After loading, I took the takeout home and opened it to see if there was no soy milk in the takeout ..., and then I called the store. Qi Yang, that Qi Yang actually said to me: (You just asked for an extra beef intestine powder, so the Qi Yang in red clothes put the soybean milk next to it, filled with beef intestine powder but forgot to put soy milk in) ... … And said that when we go back to eat the next time we give us a cup of soy milk, have we made a mistake and made a package and forgot even this tiny problem, if there are so many take-out orders every day, if the bills appear like this, the boss wants to How many complaints have you received? Pretending to take out is to be taken seriously and responsible, and it is not a question of how much money

今天早上打电话去叫了外卖！分别有皮蛋瘦肉粥/叉烧肠粉/牛肉肠粉/油条/豆浆！把车停在路边进去准备拿外卖刷卡的时候又叫多了一份牛肉肠粉，等装好之后拿着外卖回家打开一看外卖里面没有豆浆………,然后打电话问店里的企抬，那个企抬居然跟我说：（你刚叫多了一份牛肉肠粉所以那个穿着红色衣服的企抬把豆浆放在旁边，装了牛肉肠粉进去但忘记装豆浆进去）………还说等我们下次去吃的时候给回一杯豆浆我们，有没有搞错打个包连这个微小的问题都忘记，每天那么多个外卖单如果张账单都出现这种情况这样老板是要收到多少投诉呀？装外卖是需要认真对待负责，也不是多少钱的问题<//review>

Shortly after lunch, I received a text from T-Mobile informing me that I had very few minutes left on my phone allowance.  I checked the internet to see if they were open and until what time.  I took my last receipt with me and headed to Sherwood Gardens.  Personnel reception was excellent.  I handed over my former receipt , the sales person went inside to do the transaction, I received a text confirming my extension and in minutes I was on my way !  That is what  I call  EFFICIENCY !  Thanks guys !< /text>

Right from the get-go Jose didn't want to assist me. I came in the store to buy a screen protector for my new phone. I asked him to assist me with transferring everything. Before we started the transfer the LG app said the phone needed to be at 20% ( my phone was at 17%) that is when Jose said to go home and to charge it and to do the transfer at home since it was very simple. After I suggested to use one of their chargers, he had no choice but to help me. Another interest I had was to purchase a tablet, after going back and forth I finally made a decision on which tablet, well come to find out they didn't have them in stock. I asked if other stores had them, he quickly replied "NO". I wasn't convinced because he didnt bother to look or call other stores. Right after leaving the store I called the store in Monterey and well turns out they did have the tablet I wanted and to top it all off, the promotion Jose was trying to sell me on didn't start until the following day. After this experience I am sticking to the store in Monterey. If its true this Salinas branch is own by corporate you would think they would be more customer service oriented.</review>

I walked in and was not greeted and was forced to wait 25 minutes until someone even acknowledgede. Poor customer service and the worst attitudes. Workers stand around while customers wait. It's ridiculously a waste of time.<//review>

I went to T-Mobile with no expectations and walked out a proud T-Mobile user. With the help of Francisco and a little guidance from Christina I had one off the most enjoyable times purchasing a cell phone ever.  Great job.< /review>

Excellent customer service! I purchased TMobile phone here and I have never left this place ever since.

They are efficient, attentive, and excellent. They make sure that you get the help and attention you need. If the place is packed, they make sure that you get helped in the order in which you came.

Great place!</Review>

Why don't they designate a person just to take a payment and not have to wait half hour to make a payment. Ridiculous!! I came in today and 4 people were helping one customer.

Was going to.purchase a new phone but the associate said I could get one like mine for 10 bux. Picked up.phone last.month. Well battery is defective says they don't carry batteries go to batteries + which no longer exists.. So in other wirds you have to buy a new phone if you can't find a battery store anywhere 😠<//Review>

Little to no customer service. It apparently takes 4 people to help 1 customer, all I wanted was to make a payment, simple as that. Please get your lives together, thanks.<//Review>

They take so much time to help one customer. The last time I went to pay my phone bill, they were two people helping one while there was a line of 5 people waiting for help and plus some of the people that work there are not that nice.<//review>

<userid>103734735635787465490<//userid><Review>Alright, usually T-Mobile stores and I, we have a bit of an experience, be it endless upsells, being told I can buy something I can't, so on and so forth. But this time...well, things went surprisingly well and I'm absolutely floored by the experience.

Basically, I wanted to buy an iPad Mini 4. Figured I had the cash and the credit available to do it, but alas, they were out of stock and the Northridge Mall location had some. I've never, ever, ever had a good experience there so I began weighing the pros and cons and that's when the manager walks up and offers to go over to the mall to pick up the iPad and bring it to her store to sell to us. I take her up on that offer, and about 20 minutes later she walks in, iPad in hand.

Just the fact that she was willing to do that was awesome. I didn't get upsold, just got in, got out and the manager was awesome enough to save me the trouble of having to go to the other location to buy my iPad.

That said, this store does have its downsides, but I'm happy to say that this store does at least have some redeeming factors to it unlike the Northridge Mall location.</Review><gmapID>0x808df8ca185acd6b:0xbb3310ef7503ac0b</gmapID><user_name>Chris Turpin< /user_name>< Time>

It's ridiculous to be there more than 30-40 just to pay the bill... They should make a line just for payments and another for device inquiry. Or put a machine where payments can be processed.< /text>

Very fast casual Americanized Mexican food. They have beer, sangria, and a salsa bar - none of the salsas were that hot but it was pretty good nonetheless, they did have pickled carrots jalapenos all these standards. My only gripe is that they did not have pork at all on the menu, it is only limited to chicken, steak, tofu, and veggie. Pictured is the stacked chicken enchilada, comes with a side of rice and beans.<//text>

I usually love Sharky's. However the visit to this location was less than impressive. Ordered nachos with pico and gauc on the side (as they were being shared with someone with an onion sensitive) repeated this while ordering 3 times (excessive and obnoxious yes, but necessary) of course they were brought to the table with both 😒 so we sent them back. Not like I've never had to have my food remade but instead the simple scraped off the top layer (which included a major of the melted cheese threw on cold cheese and SC and brought it back as a nasty cold pile of chips with ice cold in melted cheese.<//review>

I love Sharky's happy hour!!! 3-5 pm during the week, catch me drinking a red sangria here! The nachos are amazing and fish burritos are the best.

The cost is to share. Finishing a giant burrito takes talent, hunger, and skill!!

Also a great sala bar! Always love visiting my neighborhood Sharkys.<//text>

< Review>
Good service, good food, only problem is the prices are a bit too much. This place looks like a good up to date Mexican food joint but the actual food in there is definitely overpriced and underwhelming. I'll never forget the time I asked for a simple carne asada burrito and when I actual took a bite, it was more of bean and rice burrito with little to no meat at all. I've tried out multiple times and the same results showed. I understand company's try to shave off things here and there but to lower the amount of meat in the food is a tad bit extreme. Eitherway overall it is a good place for a bit of you don't mind the prices and the serving amount!</Review>

<review>The Sharky's in Ventura is my favorite.  The Sharky's in Oxnard had 5 employees at the counter, and only 3 customers.  Reason food quality not as well served all those employees and the service was slow and confusing.  I repeated my order 5 times and it was only 2 tacos.< /review>< pictures>

First time and more pricey then I expected for the location, BUT the portion was huge. I was asked if I had a reward card, stated I did not and I was not offered one. Got chicken nachos and watermelon lemonade. Also not offerd the "free" chips they seem to be famous for. Next time I'll bring someone to share food with as I could not finish the half size nachos alone.< /Text>

< Review>
My girlfriend and I came by for the first time today. We checked out the menu and noted the many healthy options. We ordered the fajita bowl and chicken burrito. We got free chips and access to their salsa bar, which had very fresh and delicious pico de gallo. The food felt very healthy. The service was slightly above average. We used our Axxess card for a buy one get one free entree and the price seemed worth it.< /Review>

If you're in search of a physician that will take the time to explain the options and treatments that you have and then provide exceptional services then Dr. Mardanzai is your man!
He is professional, patient, and a true facial artist!
The office is beautiful and his staff are friendly and professional. I did a lot of research to find the best a d I actually drive 3 1/2 hours to see Dr. Mardanzai.
I would recommend him to anyone considering any facial cosmetic procedure.< /text>

<text>Had a wonderful experience at Prestige Med with Dr. Mardanzai! I came in with 2 other friends and he was so patient and accommodating. Outcome was fantastic and my face is so HAPPY! After trying many med spa offices, it's nice to finally found a place that I can come back to with confidence. The front desk staff is also really efficient and helpful, which is HUGE because the customer service of the front staff can make or break a practice, no matter how great the Dr. is.
Thank you, Dr. Mardanzai and staff! XOXO<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< UserId.>

Dr. Mardanzai is very honest. I trust his recommendations and opinion. He has a light hand and I can’t even feel the needles. I like that he is very professional but yet personal. I never feel pressured to buy a product or a treatment. Today he fixed my lip that was asymmetrical and he does lil things that makes a big difference. He is awesome and has a great eye for aesthetics... The stuff is very accommodating and sweet. I drive 3 hr each way just to see him.</review>

< review>
Dr Mardanzai has been my physician for more than 5 years.  I find him highly knowledgeable in western as well as tropical diseases.  He is very patient focused and every time I went to see him his medical diagnosis and treatment prescribed resulted in rapid alleviation of my pain and improvement in my condition.  Recently I came down with Shingles and Dr. Mardanzai’s medical assistant quickly accommodated me in his busy schedule and just based on the pictures of my lesions, history and phone conversation allowed me to have treatment available within 3 hours of me connecting their office.  This resulted in rapid resolution of my shingles.  Dr Mardanzai also understands patients need to be able to work while on treatment and he listened to me and tried to tailor the treatment when appropriate to ensure I get better fast and at the same time able to do my work.  I strongly recommend Dr Mardanzai to everyone specially to the professionals who needs a true medical professional who ensures patients get better fast and at the same time functional and can stay engaged with their work-place if desired.

<text>Dr. Mardanzai is awesome! I've been going to him for about 3 years. The office staff are nice and I love that he plays 80's music and lossens up the vibe. He's easy to talk to and not at all pushy. Prices are competitive and I always feel secure and taken care of during my visit. Highly recommend!<//text><pics>None< /pics><name>Andrea Ocanas</name><Resp>None</Resp><UserId.>107569250860961959111</UserId.>< Rate>

Dr. Mardanzai was great!  I’ve been looking for a good doctor since I moved from San Diego.  He is kind, let’s you know what he’s doing.  He I s quick - which for me is great as I have a needle phobia.  I’ve only seen him once before & he remembered details I told him at our first session.  I would DEFINITELY recommend him.  Oh, & his staff are all great too!  Very warm & helpful!  Love his practice!</review>

<rating>5</rating><review>I’ve been going to Dr. Mardanzai for the past 6 years and always know that I am in excellent hands. The entire staff is very knowledgeable, welcoming and professional. Dr. Mardanzai isn’t your typical Doctor who over treats/overcharges his patients but truly gets to know you and you’re needs and treats them with care. I send all of my friends and family to him as I know they are in GREAT hands. I always look forward to my appointments as the office makes you feel like family. It’s truly hard to find a Doctor like Joseph, even with me living a hour and a half away I still will make the drive knowing I will always be taken care of. To all of you reading this I guarantee you’re experience will be nothing but perfect. A true honest professional who truly cares for his clients like family !< /review>< pictures>

Dr. M is amazing, he can look at your face and know what you need immediately.  I have been going to him for several years. I wouldn’t trust anyone else with my face. I have had several different procedures there. In addition his staff is wonderful, they always make you feel like a star when you walk out.< /Review>

<Text>Drove from SF thinking it was crazy to go all the way to San Ramon for a procedure. The drive was totally worth it. They actually saw me on time, (which is not my usual experience with cosmetic- medical offices. So I was in and out on time as I hoped. The procedure went extremely well! Excellent technique, was very attentive, listened to what I wanted and did not hard sell me to get more!  Thank you dr. Joe and staff for a great experience I will be back!!</Text>< pics>

EXCEPTIONAL DOCTOR
My experience with Doctor Joseph was excellent. The office staff are very friendly. The Doctor is very nice, professional and he has a lot of experience at what he does. Doctor Joseph exceeded my expectations, I'm extremely satisfied with the results. I'm glad I chose him.  I highly recommend him.< /Text>

Very personable and made me feel at ease. What impressed me most was he didn’t try to up-sell me. He gave me the straight facts on the different fillers and didn’t try to push the most expensive on me. I’m a salesperson myself so I know when I’m being “sold.” I truly appreciated the authenticity of his advice and I’m sure I’ll go back!< /Review>

< review>
Discovered Dr. Mardanzi's office through a Groupon. The front office staff was courteous and efficient. I appreciated the Dr. and staff fitting me in to the schedule, even though I was late arriving for my appt. due to traffic.
Dr. Mardanzai took time to discuss my expectations for my procedure, and explained alternative/supplemental treatments for me to consider for the future. There was no pressure to purchase any more that what I had come to the office for that day. All in all it was a very pleasant experience. I'll be back, for sure!</review>

I purchased the One Syringe of Restylane groupon. They refused to honor it for under my eyes. This is the best under eye filler and I have had several times before. They said for a $450 consultation that I could get advice on a different filer. Seemed like a bait and switch. Also, it took them a week to call me back.</review>

What a great experience! The office itself was clean and modern, the receptionist was friendly and Dr. Mardanzai apparently has the magic touch. Rather than assuming what I wanted, he took the time to listen to my concerns and make some recommendations of his own, and told me exactly how many units he would be using before he began. I have very sensitive skin that bruises easily and I tend to look like I've been assaulted for several days after a botox treatment. However, an hour after leaving Dr. Mardanzai's office my face had no visible marks and I didn't develop so much as the tiniest bruise. Amazing! It has been just under 48 hours since my visit and I can already see major improvement. I can't imagine going anywhere else  for botox in the future. Highly recommend!</text></record>

<review>I have been going to Dr. Mardanzai for years as I trust him completely.   I recently moved south to Orange County, but was able to see the doctor last week on a trip back up to the Bay.   Dr. Mardanzai hands down has been the best and most knowledgeable doctor in this arena of medical practices for me.  This last visit was perfect - no need for any touch ups.  I’m very happy with the results and will definitely visit again when I’m back in the area.   The office staff Rose and Hazel are so sweet and nice - I highly recommend !!<//review>< Pictures>

<text>I had botox on forehead and around eyes, filler in my jowl lines and plumped up lips.  I had a great experience and love the results so far (botox will take a week to see results).  I will be back as Dr. Mardanzi will be my new "go to" for treatments.  I highly recommend him to everyone.</text></record></dataset><record>

Staff was so nice and Dr. Mardanzai couldn’t have been more friendly and informative. I was in and out in a matter of minutes and had an extremely pleasant experience (even while needles were being poked into my face).<//Review>

<rate>5<//rate><text>Visited their May, 31st, after coming from a so called english bar(nothing british about it). My friend and i came to segovias tavern and just enjoyed the vibes and music. Loved the punk,rock,metal music in the background. Drinks were great. Local tattoo artist that works across the street was their and was very welcoming to us non locals. Bar tender A1. It was just a very chill place and whenever i have a chance to come back to monterey i will definitely visit segovias. A plus was the beetlejuice movie playing in the background. 5 Star worthy tavern!!< /text><pics>None</pics><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x808de6a9e74ffef1:0x9492d3012b5fb387</Gmap_id></record>

This is a fairly popular local bar and definitely a good place to be social and meet new people. My only complaints are that they only take cash and since so many people like to celebrate there, sometimes you get the groups that insist on "jukebox wars" and prevent you from playing something from another genre.< /text>

The bartenders are real reason I come here. You get to know them after awhile and everything runs smoothly. No issues vaping in the bar.< /Review>

In a place like Monteray this is a nice traditional dive bar. Cheap drinks, friendly people. Spend time away from the $12 drinks and come here instead.</Review>

<review>I’ve eaten here quite a few times. Usually it’s good.  Tonight was a disaster.  Ribs were dry and disgusting.  Calamari was really bad and over fried.  Orange chicken was dry and gross. Very disappointed. My wife and my son were left hungry because the food was inedible.  I  also felt cheated as all the pics made the food look awesome but it did not look like the pics at all.<//review>< Rate>

Great, consistent, clean Thai food. I haven't had anything there that disappoints so I keep ordering it. Really like the atmosphere in the restaurant when you could still eat indoors. There's a nice bar you can sit at and enjoy a meal by yourself and nice tables if you're eating with someone.<//review>

Good food. Bad staff. Hostess/waitress barely talked. Had to wait for 15 minutes while she sat down to eat before she finally picked up my CC/bill and let me pay/leave.</Review>

My first Thai food, and it was exceptional. I ordered the Filet mignon  garlic green beans stir fry. The meat was very tender and the green beans crunchy. I nearly ate the whole large portion. The service was really Good, friendly staff.< /text>

Food just okay. Service minimal. Friendly atmosphere the worst I’ve seen. Barely was greeted, and never a hello or thank you or a smile. Will never eat there again!<//Review>

My favorite thai food restaurant, the pad thai is perfectly sweet. The only complaint was the service, no one was friendly and ever smiled. It would've been much more pleasant to experience this with a friendly service.< /text>

This Chinese food was good, and the service was excellent. The woman that took my order was sweet and said it would take ten minutes for the order to be prepared (I stopped in) and they were prompt with the food. I also am a fan of their spring rolls, they give 4 and the hot mustard they give you is on point! Nice and spicy just how I like it.</Review>

Best Won Ton Soup I've had with Jumbo Shrimp and Chicken Dumplings.  My wife and I share a large bowl.  Very reasonable price.  Every meal I have had was excellent and reasonable.  The owners wife does the cooking from traditional family secrets.</Review>

<text>This place is fantastic. I had the filet mignon with green beans mushroom and red pepper it looked like a picture and tasted like a work of art, all the flavors were excellent and the food was extremely fresh and properly prepared. The sauce  let you taste all the individual ingredients separately while blending together for the most delicious meal I've had in any Oriental restaurant in a long time.</text>< Pics>

Twin Panda Restaurant is definitely a must have food!  If you love home cooking with perfect portions and a great taste then Twin Panda is your place to eat.

A family owned business with such growing potential.

If you like Orange chicken, then the medium spicy Orange chicken here is going to set your expectations on a higher level and knock your socks off. I have not found another restaurant that can compete with Twin Pandas Orange delight.

This is my landmark in Woodland hills Ca.  Thank you Twin Panda family for being so welcoming and consistant with the amazing food.

Regards

The wonton soup had a surprisingly decent amount of wontons/chicken/shrimp/boc Choi. We also tried a crispy pork and Chinese broccoli stir fry with medium spice. It had good flavor and reminded us of something very familiar but we couldn't put our finger on it. I would go here again and try the fusion tacos.<//review></record>

<Rating>4</Rating><review>For their Taco Tuesday:

My top 2 tacos were: spicy ahi with Thai basil and the chicken wing with Thai slaw over the Thai larb with ground chicken and the crispy white fish with Thai slaw and avocado.   As for the duck and crispy pork belly taco, I'm sure it would be tasty and make for a great picture.

As for the seafood soup it's good but I really dislike the use of white mushrooms in Thai soups.

For dessert, I got the mango and sticky rice taco.   It's 2 bucks man.   Compared to their regular $10 mango and sticky rice and plus portion controlled. But boy, it was delicious.... should've gotten 2.

Each taco is 3 bites for me, if I were a guy, it would probably be down in 2 bites.   So order up.

As for service, they were on top of things.

They have a cool wine bar area and the whole space of the restaurant feels very feng shui.   I would come back here for their tacos again.   I already have my game plan mapped out ahead of what I'm gonna order.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<user_id>111551300982346299619</user_id><review>Nice place with very reasonable gas prices (for CA) - I really appreciate that.  However,  they need better or more helpful highway signs to get off on the correct exit.  It is also quite confusing driving throughout the parking lot/area & pulling up to the fuel pumps.< /review>< Gmap_id>

This place is a lot of fun the people who work here have a really good attitude so if you want to play some machines and when there are a few here that pay good stop at the travel center on your way to the casino hell you might not even make it to the casino went through there I I recommend that everyone going to the morongo casino stop by the travel center</review>

They discriminate against disable people whom CANNOT wear a mask due to medical conditions.  I stopped in to get gas, use the restroom and to get something to snack on and drink. They would not allow me into the store without a mask. I have a medical condition that prevents me from wearing one. This is the FIRST place that has NOT ALLOWED me into a store in the last year.. everyone else just says thank you for letting us know. I will NOT be stopping there again in the future. I travel that road several  times a year back and forth from Az  to Calif. They didn't mind taking my money for the gas though!!!< /Text>

<review>I visit to play slots and maybe get gas.  I also go therre to buy ZOTS CANDY the only place in the coachella Valley that I know of.  Lol I live zots.  The slots are a hit n miss to get a chance to win money yet entertainment here is not cheap for that reason.  If I would win at least once or twice I. The past 5 years I could give a 5 star rating however this is impossible. So 3 stars to ya</review>< Time>

Cheapest gas within 5 miles from where i live, has a big assortment of snacks, drinks, food, supplies, and other items you may need, and to top it all off, they got some slot machines in case you want to try your luck ;)< /text>

<Text>Great place to stop while traveling. RV dump station is fairly easy to get in and out of. We had no problem dumping and  we were pulling a large trailer behind the RV. Enough room to maneuver.

<text>Can I just say thank you; i understand this virus has people paranoid. But we traveled all of palm springs and not one soul would allow our 10 and 7 yr olds use the bathroom.

Not only was this facility open. It was clean and still following the distancing rules. If there was something more I could do than leave a good review, I would.

Thank you for not being one of the selfish ones that forgot so quickly that humanity is a singular entity.</text>< pictures>

<Text>Entry and exit was a hassle for bigger vehicles. Restaurants around the gas station were a hassle to get food from. Ended up ordering from in n out because their doors were open. The rest just ostracized customers in bigger vehicles. Especially since this is considered a truck stop.<//Text>< response>

I love coming here. The gas prices are always lower then my own City. Plus if I just want to chill I can play the slots! They have a large variety of snacks. Coffee cold or hot.    There is restrooms inside and also outside like a small rest stop with a car wash. Lots of eatery surround the station. You can't go wrong here!<//text>

< review>
Car wash is TERRIBLE. I paid for the Works wash (top option). The instructions when driving in are non-existent....only a red/green light system. When I drove into the bay, soap started dispensing , but I drove slightly too far (6 inches??) so it shut off. When I reversed to the correct location, the soap did not resume. The top brush did not work at all, & the side brushes did not rise up, so they only scrubbed the car (without soap!!) below the side windows. The hood, front grille, windshield, & roof were not cleaned at all.
A complete waste!!! They should have just had it closed.</review>

<review>This place has the most gas pumps in the desert as far as I'm concerned. It's a really great gas station with the longest hoses this side of the Mississippi. It has easy freeway access. It's right next to a casino! I love this gas station. The gas was great. My car drove like a champ afterwards.</review>< date>

Didn't buy gas there but I bought stuff inside people are very helpful really clean fast service you can get just about whatever you want, also there are restrooms inside the station convenience store and set outside so that you can just pull up and use the restrooms. Great place to stop if you're on a long trip lots of things to see plenty to do. Close to Hadley's Fruit Stand and also the big dinosaurs where you can get a nice lunch.</text>

<text>A VERY nice place to stop while traveling. Although they can be a bit busy, there are tons of gas pumps, maybe 30+, several cashiers that provide GREAT Customer service, clean bathrooms & most is all...one of the freshest cups of coffee I've had while traveling! Funny, but so good that I drank the first cup before getting to the register. While there, also look for the bags of trail mix  and snacks on the end cap. Great deals and cool souvenirs at Morongo Travel Center ,< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x80db408ef699760f:0x6cfaeebcf0422ee2</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Excellent fuel stop in the way they've arranged the pumps, makes it easy to get an RV in and out. Has an RV dump station for $15.00, which is pricey but not many other places nearby. Has propane fill, a decent convenience store and a few fast food and restaurant options. There's even a car wash.<//Review>

Always a great place to stop for gas. The price for gas here is always better than surrounding stations. The restrooms are located behind the pumps (north side), but are always really clean.< /review>

Favorite place to stop in the desert. There restrooms have always been well maintained in the three years I have been stopping off here. Gas prices are fair . They have slot machines in the gas station . Great service they usually have two or three cashiers to help. Place is always busy with people stopping off for a rest or gas . They have a car wash and lots of gas station snacks and beverages. Also has a great selection of restaurants, outlet stores and the casino. Worth stopping at every time. 👽<//review>

Usually the best price on fuel. Can be a headache because of inconsiderate people parked at a pump who go inside to bathroom,go shopping,order food and then come out to pump gas and then go back to get change for fuel they didn't pump. Grrrr</text>

Big gas station and snack store. Also has many places to eat close by. I go there to gas up and get some snacks  before heading back home. Convenient.<//review>

<rating>2<//rating><Review>It's very busy because of the location of the In-N-Out as well as because of the gas station. When it's hot, it's hot in that the covered parking structure is not at the gas station but for the casino. If you can avoid filling up gas at this in lieu of somewhere in either Palm Desert or Palm Springs, consider that.< /Review>< pictures>

This place is cheap on fuel and great on amenities and has slots to play with inside. Only downside and four stars in my opinion is my fuel seems to burn up quicker with the fuel they sell here rather than other places I've been to.< /Review>

They do have an RV propane refill station. Also, there's a car wash, lots of fuel pumps including diesel, and a pretty large convenience store. It's well lit at night. It's clean.< /Review>

Gas is sometimes cheap here, sometimes not. Very chaotic. Lots of people, many Towing trailers, approaching from every direction. Traffic circles near the freeway ramps don't help. Prefer not stopping here</text>

When driving from Phoenix to LA, this is always one of my stops.  It is convenient, always clean, and my truck gets better mileage on their gas.   They do offer both regular gas and deisel at fair rates.  The store contains everything you expect from a gas station convenience store, along with slot machines.  The outside restrooms are only open during the day.  At night you will need to use the restrooms inside the store, if needed.

Nearby you have food options such as Panda Express, Taco Bell, and Ruby Tuesday.  There is also a 24-hour Starbucks, which is a godsend on long trips.< /Text>

<pics>None< /pics><Review>Cheap gas - always equivalent to Sam's Club/Costco prices. Lots of pumps, and I never have to wait in line for long. However, it's not as organized as Sam's/Costco - people drive into the pumps from both sides, so it's a bit dangerous, and easy for someone to come in from the other side and take the pump that you've been waiting for (it's happened to me more than once).<//Review><date>1493688570405<//date></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Good prices on fuel here, with plenty of lanes -- so even during the busy rush hours you're not going to wait long for a fill up.  I've even seen tag-axle motorhomes pull up with trailers to fill up here.  Lots of room -- never feel crowded.<//Review><Gmap_id>0x80db408ef699760f:0x6cfaeebcf0422ee2< /Gmap_id><date>1481654636433< /date><Name>David Good< /Name></record>

Diesel pumps are so slow. Took over 10 minutes to fill 1/4 tank. I didn't bother putting anymore in it was taking so long. There payment at the machine is out dated , took four attempts for pump to actually start working after card was approved each time. Waste of time for 1/4 tank of fuel. Go elsewhere !!< /review>

Not the greatest place to stop, but certainly not the worst. Makes a great alternative place for a bathroom break if the nearby rest areas are full or closed.</text>

Nothing wrong with this place. They have arrows for the entry to their pumps but seems customers don't notice them. Major congestion due to cars trying to access the pumps from both directions.</text>

Great place to just stop in for bathroom, snacks, coffee and maybe a couple of slot machines without having to enter into the actual casino. Don't forget the super cheap gas prices.</review>

Gas prices usually 20 cents cheaper, many pumps means you get through faster, small rest area for longer trips. Oh, car wash is quick< /text>

Cheapest gas around, and benefits indigenous people who own the land and the store. People lining up in their cars are a little nutty/ unethical when waiting to claim a pump, but not too bad.</text>

Our new favorite rest stop for our trips to and from California. The gas prices are usually reasonable (for southern California), there are multiple choices for a food stop, and there's a small, grassy area near the car wash where the kids can run around and let off steam.<//Text>

(Translated by Google) Very friendly staff.
The refueling in the US is known not to be uncomplicated with "external" credit card.
First "numbers" at the cash register with an estimate of the volume of fuel you need.
Overpaid is refunded.
At Morongo the prices are always very cheap.
Today, the Gallon Regular (E87) cost only 2.76 bucks.
Converted € 0.62 / liter.
Since the "Cruising" fun.
On the occasion, a big compliment for our Dodge Van. 3.6 liters 6-speed automatic.
With reasonable use of the accelerator pedal, over land 5.0 liters / 100 km are possible.
In eco mode WITHOUT air conditioning.
I think it's easy to 6-8 liters / 100km in the mix possible.

(Original)
Sehr freundliche Angestellte.
Das Tanken in den USA ist bekanntlich mit "externer"  Kreditkarte nicht unkompliziert.
Erst "Anzahlen" an der Kasse mit einem Schätzwert des Volumens an Treibstoff den man braucht.
Zu viel gezahltes wird rück-überwiesen.
Bei Morongo sind die Preise immer sehr günstig.
Heute kostete die Gallone Regular (E87) nur 2,76 Bucks.
Umgerechnet 0,62 €/Liter.
Da macht das "Cruisen" Spaß.
Bei der Gelegenheit ein dickes Lob für unseren Dodge Van. 3,6 Liter 6-Gang-Automatik.
Bei vernünftigem Umgang mit dem Gaspedal, über Land sind 5,0 Liter/100 km möglich.
Im Eco Mode OHNE Klimaanlage.
Ich denke es sind locker 6-8 Liter/100km im Mix möglich.</Text>
