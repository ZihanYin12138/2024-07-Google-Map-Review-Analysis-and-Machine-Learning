<text>Ramy has been extremely helpful. I was very thankful that he tried to work through a few things with me over the phone prior to coming out, especially since it was not a remodel that I was trying to do, so much as determining whether or not my second floor could handle the weight of some things we had to move in.</text><resp>None< /resp>< rate>

Building a new house has been difficult during COVID, but by far the best part of the experience has been working with Ramy. He is a true professional and an expert at his craft.

Ramy met us on our empty lot we purchased, talked with us about what we wanted in a house, guided us through tricky decisions, and designed our dream home. When he showed us the first draft of the plans, we were amazed. He knocked the design out of the park, and the changes we requested on the design were all very minor.

We have had a lot of trouble dealing with our city for permits, and it seems like Ramy knows our city codes better than any other contractor we talked to and the city employees themselves. For example, the fire department said we had to move the house because we didn't have room for a "fire access road". I told Ramy and he immediately told me that the fire department was wrong because the house has sprinklers, and all new construction requires sprinklers. Turns out he was right, and the fire department accepted this explanation and gave us our permit.

The first builder we talked to suggested changes to the plans, and Ramy expertly explained how that would benefit the builder but would ultimately be a bad idea. He knows the construction process extremely well and gave us tips for dealing with builders and contractors.

When Ramy submitted the designs to the city, we only had to go through one round of comments, and all of the city feedback was extremely minor and was easily fixed/approved within a week or so. This probably saved us months of waiting on the city.

Ramy originally didn't put in detailed electrical plans because our city didn't actually care about them for permits, which saved us time and money (you can usually just do electrical plans with your builder). However, when our builder requested detailed electrical plans, Ramy was able to make them within a couple weeks and charged us a very fair price for them on short notice.

I could keep going on. Working with Ramy has been a joy and we greatly appreciate working with him!<//Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>We want to remodel the first floor of our house, and we consulted a number of contractors and engineers before we found Ramy. We would've saved months of deliberation if we had just called him first! Just the consultation alone gave us so much value. He was so informative, helpful, and kind. I think the most important part is that we felt like we could really trust him, and that can be hard to find. With his architectural design background, he was able to look at our space from an angle that we hadn't even thought of. He's clearly great at functionalizing spaces and has a great eye for aesthetics. We now have a clear path forward, and I'm so excited about how our house will be transformed! Thank you again, Ramy.< /review><pics>None</pics><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>I am so pleased that I entrusted Ramy with the design of my Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU).  I showed him some design ideas I had been working on for a small house for my mother-in-law, Nancy. When he came to visit the site, he had some marvelous suggestions for changes, including turning the ADU 90 degrees.  After his first draft design was complete, he answered questions from Nancy and me, and incorporated our ideas for change.

There are a number of qualities that stand out for Ramy.  Chief among them is his integrity; I felt all along I could trust him fully, and he has not let me down.

Another important quality is his willingness to see the project up to and through the permitting process.  Ramy has been a terrific ally of mine when working with the city.  He has been in touch with them personally—usually by phone—to understand their requirements and relate them to me.  He has been very patient when explaining things I did not fully understand.

Another quality is his thorough knowledge about California building codes.  He was able to quickly address and fix the few upgrades the city engineers required. (Each city has its own standards beyond what California requires.)

The bottom line is this: Ramy is a top-notch architect with great knowledge and integrity.  I will not hesitate to use his services in the future.<//Review>< Pics>

<Text>Ramy provided a phenomenal experience. He did an excellent job developing the full plans of my 1200 sq ft ADU. He guided me to the right support services such as land surveyors and soil engineers. He can easily envision the end product and is extremely responsive 24/7. My project was approved by a very particular city planning and engineering team in 45 days without any revisions which is a testament to his work. I plan to work with him again in the future.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

After interviewing many architects and contractors who do plans in addition to construction, we settled on artoo design because of Ramy's professionalism, vision of what our house could be, and his patience. Throughout the process, our expectations have been met and often exceeded by this talented architect. Ramy has worked with us throughout the process and answered any and all questions. He gently guided us to a design that while a bit modernized and unique, still fits well within our community and gave us the design that we need to fit our growing family and its needs.

While this is a big project for us - second story addition with first floor remodel - the pricing was reasonable and he was able to fit all of our needs into the design. The plans and updates were delivered when promised, if not sooner, and were well notated, which really helped us easily push through the HOA approval and city permitting.

As construction is ongoing, he has continued to offer support and answer questions as they come up and his responses continue to be very timely. He has helped make this complicated process a bit easier and less stressful. I am looking forward to moving into this house once the construction is complete.</Review>

Ramy, has been amazing.  He designed a large remodel for me in Duarte and has been responsive and thoughtful from start to finish.  The site was complex due to previous a semi permitted enclosed space and a requirement to add a bathroom.  Ramy, identified potential solutions to permit the space while planning for minimizing cost and changes.   He even handled working through the approval process as I was not in the area.  I intend to utilize Ramy again in future developments.< /review>

Ramy is knowledgeable, honest, and easy to talk to.  He answered all my questions and explained everything to detail.  My wife and I knew what we wanted but had different thoughts about our addition and we had a hard time deciding. Ramy offered a different vision that incorporated what we both wanted.  He was able to create plans within our price range without sacrificing quality.  Even after completing the plans for our addition,  Ramy offered to remain available for questions and assistance if we needed it. I strongly recommend Ramy if you are looking for an architect.<//text>

This was our first major home renovation and so we didn’t really understand how to distinguish between what was possible, what was reasonable, and what was a completely terrible idea.  He was able to translate our vague and crazy asks into a concrete floor plan and create solutions we couldn’t even begin to imagine.

He also wasn’t afraid to tell us straight up what wouldn’t work which ultimately saved us a bunch of time.  He would clarify sometimes that what we were talking about was possible but that we would be better off just rebuilding the entire house.  Our project was pretty intricate and involved a lot of changes to the framing of the house. Ramy’s provided very detail-oriented plans which were accepted at county on the first try!  This was fantastic because we had heard it’s not uncommon for plans to require many rounds of changes before they got approved which can take months.

Ramy is very nice and very good.  We highly recommend him for your engineering/architectural needs.< /Review><Name>Silas Richelson</Name>< Pics>

<text>Ramy is highly recommended for his incredible work and our great working relationship. He is highly professional and an expert in his field.

He was always extremely patient and responded thoroughly to every question we had and never rushed us. If we didn't understand something, he provided a safe environment for us re-ask questions.

Ramy is good at breaking down information that could be easily understood by anyone. He also provided the pros and cons of every decision and gave us tips on how we could save money.

Lastly, he is prompt to respond and proactive in his work. You do not need to follow up with him which is incredibly important if you're already juggling many things.

Ramy was the perfect fit for us and our residential remodel needs. I could not have asked for a better architect for our project.< /text>< name>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>We hired Ramy to design a room and full bath addition on our house.  We were very impressed with his freehand drawing of our idea as we discussed our project with him during our first consultation.  He understood everything we wanted and knew exactly how to make our concept a reality. He was very knowledgeable on the permit process and inspection process once we started construction. His building plans were very well done, which made getting a permit that much easier.  He has been available to our contractors during our construction and has a very quick turnaround to any emails, texts, or messages we have left him.  His communication with us has been great. Our room addition has received several complements from our neighbors, telling us how well he designed a look that makes it look seamless with the rest of the properties on our street.  We look forward to adding our side-by-side pictures when construction is complete because that was one of the reasons, we picked Artoo Design S2dio in the first place.  His reviews and his website had several before and after pictures we were impressed by.  Ramy is very knowledgeable and easy to work with.  We highly recommend him for your next building project.  He is an exceptional architect with great customer service.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

We have used Ramy to add second story to our home in Diamond Bar. My son searched a lot and decided to go with Ramy. It was the best decision we have made. He gave us the idea what can be done and with our input he came up an very open plan for us and now construction is almost complete and we are very happy with it. I was really impressed with his handling with the city to get the plans through.  He always was available to to answer questions and guide through the process. Being an design engineer my self I was blown away with the structure design of the house. Even with all the structure construction cost was very reasonable, thanks to Ramy's suggestions. I will recommend him any body want a quality work at reasonable cost. friends and family have walked though the house during construction and they were very impressed not only the open plan also with the design of the house.<//Text>

<Text>Ramy did an amazing job of turning our vision into something we can build. We came in with pretty specific ideas and Ramy helped us navigate the complex state and local building codes so that we could find the perfect fit between what our vision was and what was actually legal to build.

Ramy is knowledgeable, punctual and highly skilled at what he does. I would recommend him to anyone that is looking to have plans drawn up for a custom or commercial build.< /Text>< rate>

I contacted Ramy and asked him to help us sketch some ideas for changes to the home plan we are considering building.   We had some major issues with the plan and couldn’t develop a solution on our own.  Ramy met with us and developed some excellent solutions that solved the problems we were facing.

<review>I'd like to share my experience as a small developer/ owner of some residential properties in Riverside & Orange counties, it's long story but worth reading, and may save you time and money in your project adventure
We started 4 years ago shopping around for good team of architects and engineers to work on our projects, we picked the lowest quote from someone (apparently not licensed) but we didn't care at that time, he handled all work, wasn't that good, but for us, we didn't have experience to judge it whether good or bad package. But unfortunately we got a lot of hits by the city asking to submit plans prepared by professional architect, along with long list of comments, red lines, ...etc. seems like we didn't submit anything at all (1st lesson), when we gave it back to that drafter, he kept sleeping on it for more than 3 months with no action, then.... disappeared. (2nd lesson) which was very expensive one to learn. we have to move forward anyways, so we grabbed old list of architects, called all of them and asked everyone for his license, guess what, only 2 out of 14 have licenses!! we decided to get quote from them to complete the work,  but this time we hired the most reliable one based on his references and previous work (we had to do excessive research this time) then decided to hire Ramy as the architect of record on that project, he had to charge us everything again, we don't blame him for that, and fortunately, he is very effective, responsible for his plans, and on top of all - for us - he is very trustworthy. the plans review process went very smooth, just minor comments, and we got approvals in short time. we discovered when we gave the approved plans to our contractors, they said the old plans were over designed, and they dropped their quote significant amount, so even paying more to someone professional will save you good amount of money down the road. again & again, don't waste your money with drafters (3rd lesson)
We almost finished the framing of our 3rd project, not to mentioned Ramy's prompt response on our RFI, e-mails, calls, text msgs, we shower him (we are bad guys) with questions and every time he gets back to us explaining everything  passionately as if it's our first question, you get what you paid for (4th lesson).  Thank you, Ramy & Artoo Design for being a good helper on our projects. EC</review><Rate>5<//Rate><Time>1595445347798<//Time><Name>Eric construction< /Name>< Pictures>

Ramy has been amazing to work with! He helped me with a full scale remodel for an investment property I purchased to flip in Claremont. The house had an awkward layout that I knew needed to be revised but was stumped on how to do it. Ramy's ideas were genius and simple at the same time. He is very patient and was great at walking me through the process from design to submittal of plans. I was confused with the permitting process so Ramy took care of the appointments with the city planning department and the plans came back approved on the first attempt!  He was mindful of costs understanding my project was on a stricter budget and helped me make decisions to keep costs down. I can't wait to work with him again on the next project. I highly recommend him!< /review>

We found Artoo Design S2dio on yelp and called Ramy, he met with us next day, we explained our desire and budget for our house major remodeling and addition, then he explored couple of ideas, one of them perfectly satisfied our wish list and in timely manner he prepared the plans, wrapped up fully detailed construction document package including architectural and engineering blueprints, electro-mechanical and energy calcs, everything submitted to the city and came back with very minor few comments, Ramy took care of it and we just got the permit issued today. We are so happy dealing with ARTOO DESIGN S2DIO. For any one looking for licensed professional architect, Ramy is very responsive, very talented, and highly recommend.<//Review>

Ramy is a true professional and very talented architect.   He was able to take the vision for our house and put it to paper.  His design was thoughtful and helped maximize all of the perks of our lot, from house placement on the lot to floor plan and site lines to take full advantage of our views.  Getting plans approved through the city is an arduous process and we couldn’t have made it through without him and his immense knowledge.  You can't go wrong by working with him<//text>

I'm an architect, and a general contractor / builder. Ramy is by far the best designer I've met and worked with so far. He is personable, professional, hard working, responsive, smart and very down to earth. Although I would not want him to get too busy and popular by the help of amazing yelp reviews (I think he already is), I thought it'd be nice to share a gem with other peers and home owners. It's 11:00 pm on a Friday night and we're currently discussing about trusses.< /Review>

< Review>
Ramy has been amazing to work with on our addition and home remodel. My friend found his name on yelp and I have been so grateful ever since that we called him.  It has been a long process trying to secure permits, but Ramy has been there every step of the way. He is always quick to respond to any questions or concerns and has been patient in helping us understand what can and cannot be done. I couldn’t have asked for a more professional, honest, or harder working architect/engineer.

He also recommended our contractor and we have been very happy with him so far. I cannot recommend Ramy enough. He is a really nice guy and a wonderful architect. You will not go wrong if you hire him for your project.< /Review>

<review>You can trust them! Good price! Good job they have done! Most important thing: they know city likes and don't like, 90% guarantee pass city requires even before submit! Sounds like Advertising here, right? But this is who they are, I can't hide the truth, Lol
Ramy is a very honest guy, he likes to make friends and keep on going the good friendship even after the job done, this is why he is successful in the career!
Highly suggest you choose the company!</review><gmap_id>0x80dccbb55606d2eb:0xa40cb2c8ce4cdc07</gmap_id>< user_id>

Ramy is awesome to work with.  We have been flipping houses for about 10 years now and we will definitely be using him for all of our future projects.  He is fast but detailed and when we needed changes to the blueprints he was very helpful.  I definitely recommend him for your architectural needs.</text>

<review>Ramy is very trustworthy and reliable. He is easy to talk to and understands the vision that you want it to happen. Me and my husband wanted to rebuild our house from single level 1400 sq ft to 2 storeys 2800 sq ft and he made the plans for us. I remember the first time I met with him, he was on time with his appointment, he was courteous and keenly listens to the details of what we want. But he will not hesitate to give you suggestions, and you need to listen to him too because that's his forte. When you try to reach him and he's with another client, he will always call you back. Ramy, is a man of his word. Don't hesitate to hire him for any Architectural and Engineering projects, for sure he will not fail you. I highly recommend him to anybody.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

<Text>Hiring Mr. Ibrahim was a great experience, he helped us to design our home remodel, the whole process went very smooth, specially with getting the city’s building permit in a timely manner.
Comparing my experiences with other design firms Artoo studio’s staff are very knowledgeable, creative and their prices are very reasonable also their services extend till the completion of construction to respond to all the questions from us and our contractor.<//Text><user_id>118034854508583391478</user_id>< Name>

I am a Design Engineer and have been working with Ramy for a few years.  I can't say enough good things about him.  He is very professional and easy to work with.  The quality of his designs are top notch!  I recommend him to all of my clients looking for an architect because I know they will receive excellent service with Artoo Designs.<//review>

<Review>We are real estate investors working on multiple new builds and flips. We've had experiences with several architects, some good, few bad. But all of them significantly raised their prices due to the demand of all the housing activity.

I have found Ramy's prices to be very affordable. He charges way less than others I have worked with and more importantly, does better job. He values your time, which is extremely important considering the housing costs is real estate investments, and works with me individually to answer all my questions.

Make sure you involve him during your process of searching for an architect.<//Review>< user>

Well it looks like Ramy the architect at Artoo Design S2dio is already a super starred, highly rated engineer on a lot of platforms.  I am here to testify to his genuine, professional and thorough character as a professional but also a person.  He earns our highest marks and esteem for a second opinion consult on plans we had done with another engineer.  Ramy answered the call on Saturday night and even today, on a Sunday morning (please don't call him on weekends, I am bad person!!!).   Ramy has his name etched in gold in our iPhones and will call him for all future projects and refer him to anyone that asks for an architect/engineer project.  Lynn & Kirk, realtors.<//review>

<Time>1565150684158< /Time><rating>5< /rating><text>Finding a good architect can be challenging since there aren't a lot of places where you can see multiple reviews. There is Houzz, but even there, they won't have a ton of options for someone local and most architects with a lot of reviews were far from where I live and are priced well above what I was willing to pay. You can also go to the AIA (American Institute of Architects) website to find someone local, but you won't get any reviews there. But they do provide a list of architects who are accredited and licensed. I hope at some point, you'll be able to find more architects and builders with solid reviews, but as of now, the number of reviews are pretty limited.

Anyway, finding Ramy was a real blessing and we're glad we reached out to him. We had actually contacted him a year earlier, but decided to take a step back and interview other architects and design/build firms since our project was fairly large with an addition of over 800 sq feet and the full renovation of the existing property that included some removed walls and many other things that would require someone with this type of knowledge.

From the get-go, Ramy was always patient and tried to explain things as best as he could. And as with any relationship such as this, you're bound to run into some differences, but nothing that couldn't be worked out. He has a very calming and pleasant personality and tries to make the best of every situation. But what we really liked about Ramy was that he was always easy to get a hold of and would immediately return any calls for almost anything. Just that alone brought so much peace of mind, as getting plans finalized with LA County can get daunting.

We also interviewed a couple of his recommended General Contractors and chose one that we thought was a good fit for us. That is also another bonus of hiring Ramy in that he has a ton of reliable contacts that can also help you with other parts of your project. Having these recommendations is a big plus since finding a reliable GC for such a large project is also pretty daunting.

You won't go wrong hiring Ramy. He's a competent architect at a very, reasonable price. So if you're looking for an architect, call him now before he gets too busy to work with you!< /text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

<Review>After a not so great remodel project a couple years ago, I’ve become an even firmer believer in finding a solid architect engineer from the beginning. It saves you a lot of headache and heartache later on. Luckily we found the perfect partner in Ramy!

Ramy is extremely responsive, understood our vision, had his own perspective and could provide feedback, timely in responses, creative in finding solutions, and experienced — such that our plans were pretty much approved with pretty much no issue at all! And that’s as good as it gets - a smooth city approval process!

Highly highly recommend! And would work with him on future projects<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><gmapID>0x80dccbb55606d2eb:0xa40cb2c8ce4cdc07<//gmapID><user_name>Naydia Chantar</user_name></record>

<text>I've had the pleasure of working on several projects with Ramy. Being a general contractor I've experienced the work of many designers 1st hand, and Ramy brings much more to the table then an average designer. Aside from having a keen sense of creative options for maximum functionality, he also is very knowledgable and resourceful with the entire spectrum of the design/permitting process. I have referred and will continue to refer him clients in the past, and all have thanked me for his valuable input and professionalism.</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

You will not be disappointed when you partner with Ramy! As a matter of fact, if your experience is anything like mine, not only will you not be disappointed, but your expectations will be exceeded! Ramy was the first architect I contacted about a year before we decided he was the right one. And over the course of a year, we met with over a dozen. Again, please take my advice and don't waste your time interviewing multiple architects. From the first time we talked, Ramy was very polite, and attentive to our needs. I was very impressed. Ramy's level of customer service for the whole process has been nothing short of amazing. He was always available to answer questions and explain things that didn't quite make sense to me, even when I asked the same question multiple times! In addition to his unbelievable talent for design, his thoroughness in the details of his plans made the approval process with the city very smooth. Even when I had an impromptu meeting with the city, he was on standby to help me address any questions that they might have had...by the way in that meeting, what they thought Ramy missed in the plans was actually there, the city overlooked it. Just another example of his thoroughness. I've already recommended Ramy to multiple people, and absolutely recommend him to anyone who may come across his page. His prices are very reasonable, especially for what you get from Ramy. We are doing a room addition and remodel, which is a pretty big project for us and something we've never done before. Not knowing what to expect can be kind of overwhelming, but when you have an Architect like Ramy on your team, you honestly have nothing to worry about. Ramy thank you so much, you had such a big impact on this project for my family, and we couldn't be more pleased with the level of guidance and service you provided for us!<//Review><username>Saj Ahmed</username>< pictures>

I don't normally write reviews but Remy has worked on several of our projects that were very complex and we're very important to us.  We had hired two architects  before Remi but they failed to complete the work and had no knowledge yet provided lot of hope.  Thanks we found Remi to rescue us.  He not only relied on our vision but also provided honest advise.  The advise he provides are from his decades of experience and from professional knowledge.  This was very  important because we felt we had someone to guide us in right direction.  He precisely measured, assessed and investigation properties.  He is aware of most city rules, Regulation and requirements so on the spot he would know what's possible and what's not instead of playing waiting game.  He stands by his work so if city has any feedback on plans or designs, he reviewed them at once and communicated with city inspectors and administratives.  The one other thing we thought was that he is friendly by nature.
We are happy to recommend Remy to anyone who wants right architect and designer.  We will only hire Remy whether we are constructing new home, Hotel, shopping center or office complexes.  Design and architecting is most important phase of any construction project and wrong architects only wasted our time and lengthened our project, but Remy was good guy to understand our situation and realized importance of Projects.  Word of advice from someone who went through multiple architects -- hire right architect or I guarantee the project will never complete.  Thanks to Remy for helping us out and achieve our goal.<//Review>

We were looking for architects when we were thinking about constructing an additional dwelling unit to our home.  We decided to go with Ramy from Artoo Design S2dio because of the great reviews and comments.  It was a pleasure dealing with Ramy, he answered all our questions, was prompt with any phone calls and emails, and was very professional.

I highly recommend him for any future projects that you may consider.
Thank you Ramy!</text>

Before hiring Ramy, i had spoken to 8 different architects to help me with my custom home project. by looking for the others licenses, found out 5 of them are just designers/ drafters, they do not have California license which i told that practicing architecture without license in California is a violation. Anyways, i filtered them to 3 including Ramy, 2 of them couldn't design the home i was looking for. When i hired Ramy, he knew exactly what i was looking for and immediately started the design. He was very punctual and got the job done the way i wanted to.  I couldn't have hired such an honest, professional and knowledgeable designer. Not to mention his price is very fair for the work he does. highly recommended and don't waste your time with other designers and drafters, hire a professional. i am attaching his contacts below.</Review>

We are planning to add 2nd level addition. We interviewed many architects and finally approached Ramy by Yelp reviews. Ramy carefully listened to our requirements. Based on our requirements Ramy suggested suitable plans & drawings. Which we liked and the most important thing is he is very humble, down to earth person and he is very personable & likable, may be that's his in-built talent. He was very accommodative towards our drilling questions. What an amazing person he is. Ramy always answers phone calls, and very responsive all the times. We are happy to work with Ramy. It is very hard find people like Ramy.Thanks, Ramy!!<//review>

I never write Yelp reviews but this one is absolutely deserved.
I contacted ARTOO DESIGN S2DIO for work for our new custom home, Ramy took the time to call me back quickly and give me a thorough phone consultation. He again very quickly followed up with proposal and package for submittal, he did all his work as expected and even earlier than his time frame. Of all the people we interacted with planning for this project, NOBODY was as helpful and patient as Ramy. I absolutely would not hesitate to reach out to him should my needs ever coincide with the services he and his company provide. Thank you Ramy!!!</Text>

We would like to Thank Ramy for designing, planning & completing our family room/master bath remodeling project.  Ramy did an excellent job from the start to finish.  Ramy is very attentive to detail and his communication and plans were of high standards.  His knowledge and experience in design was greatly appreciated.  Our blueprint plans went to the City with a very minor change that was taken care of by Ramy right away and resubmitted and approved with no problems.   We highly recommend Ramy in designing your remodeling and architectural project needs.</review>

We found Artoo Design S2dio on Google, reached out to Ramy and his staff, He answered a lot of questions over the phone without even having any contact or commitment, he was very professional, accommodating, and generally very helpful that gave us a lot of confidence to hire him.
From the first approach, Ramy was great at visualizing, setting priorities and programs for our major remodeling and 2nd story addition in Fontana. His knowledge, vision, creativity saved us a lot of time and money. I found him incredibly knowledgeable and generous with his time. Helped us finding very good contractor that best fit our project.
I would definitely use him in the future and recommend him highly. Thanks again Ramy for your great work.<//Review>

<Text>In Nov 2016, We bought a house and hired Ramy to do an extension on the back and front of my house, and relocate the stairway that feels like an "elephant in the room" as one enter the house.   Before we hired Ramy, I interviewed 2 other Architects. First architect tried to convince me it was a difficult task to relocate the stairway and suggested to me not to do it.  The 2nd Architect will do exactly as I want, but has nothing more to contribute.
When we first met Ramy to explore the project, Ramy understood holistically what we were trying to accomplish.    He can envision the dream we have and the budget constraints we have to live with.  We were very impressed with his energy, positive attitude and creativity as he walked through our house and described the possibilities and suggestions to enhance the ideas we have, without breaking our budget.   One can't help but sense his love and passion for Design and That to me explains why we feel he is outstanding in what he does.

The next day, he gave me his project proposal. His fee was very reasonable and I signed the contract with him.  Since then, we have been more than pleased with Ramy's professionalism, timely and quality work.  He is always responsive and take the necessary time and steps to walk us through the "remodeling" process, and provide us many invaluable insights and ideas.

There are certainly a lot of challenges in home remodeling /expansion.  We are first timer and we are very fortunately to have found Ramy through Yelp.   Ramy gave us the encouragement and guide us along the way.  Hiring Ramy as our Architect was certainly the best 1st step we took.< /Text>< Resp>

Not the ideal place to shop, there are lots of homeless people and drug addicts along with criminal activity that takes place. Also parking is a nightmare the way people drive causes accidents almost multiple times daily< /Text>

The pizza hut there is horrible. Cold food after waiting hours. The management does not have any experience. If I could give a -5 I would. Also the fact that they behave as if they are doing something for you is a even worse issue. Customer service??? Please.</Text>

I would put zero stars *I brought my 13 year old son, a baseball player for travel ball in the South Bay and high school freshmen. I came here twice with my sons and never had a problem. I trusted the owner to suggest a barber (a new guy) who completely ruined my sons hair cut , confidence and I kept him home because the hair cit was a fade turned into a deformed line up and horrible fade. I couldn’t believe it. My son never agreed or asked for a line up . My son was quiet and bothered . I told the owner and nothing was done. I don’t recommend single moms or mothers with sons that would expect great service . Don’t use my kid for a guinea pig , for a start up barber. I trusted you and would never want that for any one else’s teenager. My kids a stud and now we go to Moe paramount barber< /text>

Hair cuts are awesome but they take their time to make every single haircut perfect.(Took 3 hours for me to finally get a haircut, after that it took 1 hour for the barber to finish.)<//Text>

Herminio Muñoz is one of the best Barbers I ever met. I leave in Littlerock California and I drive all the way to Paramount California just to get a haircut with Herminio. Wish We had a barber like him in Littlerock ,CA.< /review>

Every time I have had to call, I have sat on hold for a minimum of 1 to 4 hours, only to have my call "dropped" just I finally reached a live person!.
My advice to anyone who has to call this call center; prior to disclosing why you are calling, make sure you have the person who answers take down your name and call back number. Then get their commitment that they will call you back in the likely event there is a disconnect. Otherwise, if your reason for calling is too complicated or requires. more of an effort from them than just basic data entry (like updating an address), there is a good chance your call will be "conveniently" dropped. Of course, the worker, unable to identify who they were just talking to,  will have no choice but to forget about you and move to the next client waiting  on hold. You will be left frustrated, inconvenienced and unaccomplished in whatever it was prompting your call in the first place. You will have gotten nowhere and taken all day to get there. The real inconvenience will be in having to wait until the following day, the next week, or worse, until after their "paid" holiday to get your medical insurance approved, your money released or your food stamps loaded on your card. Too bad for you if your surgery gets postponed because you have no insurance coverage, your baby goes without diapers for a day, or your next meal won't happen for another 4 days. At least all the over compensated folks essentially paid to hang up on you will get their much  "needed" rest before they return to the grulling task of picking and choosing who they are going to help!</review>

<Text>Terrible. Phones are way too backed up. Expect to be on hold for at least 3 hours. I was on hold for 3 hrs 45 min after I finally got through I was immediately disconnected. Decided to go to the office (with my 1 year old) and it was really upsetting after waiting in line they immediately pushed me away and said they could not help because their services are limited due to COVID. All I needed to do was cancel my medi cal benefits. This is upsetting because they were welcoming others in for applying for benefits, so why couldn’t they help with canceling? The phones need call back options at the very least. Very disappointing.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Super reduced hours 9-12  and NOT able to help existing cases...so you're stuck on the phone for 40 minutes waiting and then  the call gets dropped!  Ugh.  The people helping in the line mean well and are trying to help  but it's like being in a black hole during Covid.</Review>

They don't have an efficient way of handling accounts. I waited over 2 hours  just to get hung up on because it went over the time they closed. All I wanted was to know if I had medi-cal still And to get a new card. I suggest dividing up who deals with quick cases and who deals with complicated cases. Y'all need to do better< /text>

Wait times on the phone are absurd. Either put in a feature that allows a caller to know their place in the line throughout the call or hire more staff. I cannot stress how horrible the wait times are. I consistently wait 2 hours to end up having to go somewhere and not able to talk to someone.</Review>

While reviewing my kids Medi-cal enrollment, someone at Sonoma county unchecked the box saying my husband and I wanted insurance. This caused our insurance plan -separate from MediCal-to be cancelled. It took 2 hours on thephone with the insurance and Covered Ca to determine the county of Sonoma caused this problem. Now I have to wait 14-30 days for the insurance to be normal again. Best case scenario is I have to pay for all doctor visits and medicines for now and the insurance will pay me back later. More time and energy spent on something caused by incompetence. They cant even pave roads anymore they should NOT be in charge of people's health care. And who are they hiring? Not smart caring people with integrity. How much training do they get? Obviously not enough to give a damn about how their work effects people's lives. I wish I could give zero stars and honestly I'd like to sue them. But who has the time.< /Review>

It'll take you hours just to talk to someone the first time and you will likely have to come more than once. It's like the dmv but longer wait times.

If you're a student at SRJC, you can go to Health Services for medi-cal and CalFresh and it'll take you less than 20min.< /Text>

I got through the DMV-like numbered waiting queue fairly quickly (~15 minutes) on a late Monday morning. Had my business dealt with quickly and politely. My only complaint is that the waiting room is a bit stuffy and feels a little germy. I walked out with a tickley, mildly congested-feeling throat. I suppose it's a bit hard to help with the amount of traffic they get every day from people looking for assistance with various healthcare issues, though.</Text>

<username>Danielle Martin<//username><Review>I reserved a compact car because my personal vehicle was struck in a accident earlier.  When I arrived No compact cars were available. The sales clerk did inform me she was waiting on vehicles to be returned and only had big size cars. However it would have been nice to call around to see if other Hertz in the area could assist me. I was referred here from my insurance company state farm because of lower rates but I ended up renting from enterprise as they were more eager to accommodate my needs.</Review>< userid>

VERY BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE, I JUST CALLED OVER THE PHONE REGARDING AN INCIDENT AND NEEDED TO ASK A COUPLE QUESTIONS AND FOLLOW UP  AND THE LADY ANSWERED THE PHONE WAS VERY RUDE AND LOUD WITH ME. SHE COULD HAVE EXPLAINED IT NICELY AND HELP PUT. DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS LOCATION FOR RENTAL CAR. THESE DAYS CUSTOMER SERVICE PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN ANY BUSINESS.<//Text>

I paid for an Uber to get to their location. I called them to let them know I was on my way for 30 min I called and NO ONE answers!!!
...my reservation was at 6pm I arrived at 6:02pm and they were closed. Don’t rent from here. Should of read reviews beforehand. 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼</Text>

<Review>Rented a car on 25th of September and this one star goes to the front desk lady (I think her name was Danielle)
Her manner was just disgusting. Very unfriendly and unhelpful. No smiles no customer relations. She ruined the whole rental experience.
As a business owner myself I can’t image who would hire someone like this. Also on the phone she was disgraceful (while talking to my wife)
Huge difference from a competitive company I usually go to. And because of her I will not go back to this hertz
Sept 27th-coming back I do want to mention a super great guy who when I brought back the car was so helpful and sweet and a pleasure to work with. (Wish I remember his name)
Ps Daniele was there when I returned the car with the same stinking attitude.</Review><user_name>Hai Kaner</user_name>< pictures>

I couldn't wait to stop and write a review. We rented a Truck as we ran around for my bestfriend's bridal shower and wedding.  I can't imagine how many people we dealt with over the course of the planning process. But Nico at HERTZ stands out for sure. So, grateful for you excellent communication, knowledge, suggestions and all around great service.  We are forever grateful and we will see you guys again.< /text>

<resp>None</resp><Review>Since the first day I walk through their doors I've had excellent service and have been completely Satisfied with every vehicle I've gotten. They are by far the best rental yard in service and timeliness. I will no longer go anywhere else and will continue to recommend this rental yard to everyone I know. On top of all that their prices are absolutely amazing! needless to say they have made a customer for life.

I can't believe it's been 7 months since I first came to this Hertz location and even though they had a change in management and employees they continue to be one of the best car renting locations I've had the pleasure of frequenting with that being said Jarrett Sidney has been one of the most helpful employees they have and is the reason why I will continue to frequent this Hertz location.<//Review>< pictures>

The Reseda location was very helpful and friendly. Jarrett is awesome in handling customer service, even when it swamped, he acknowledges every customer who come in.<//review>

<text>They changed quotes between when we picked up and dropped off.

They charged us 21 days when we had a rental for 13. Not only that it was covered under insurance!

To make matters worse, it's hard to even get in contact with them to find out how bad they are ripping you off.

Even if you some how get someone on the phone, nothing gets fixed.

The manager is a ghost and doesn't return calls.</text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

<review>WORSE SERVICE EVER!!!, I had a reservation for 8am and pick up arranged, I called first thing in the morning to confirm my ride, the ONLY guy in the office told me "I'm alone here, everybody else will be late, so when someone gets here, I'll send them to pick you up, it might be around 9:30 or 10am",  what a crappy service! that's why Enterprise is a little more pricey, its called GOOD service, last time with Hertz.<//review>< user_name>

Jeff is the worst retail manager I have ever dealt with. He never returns phone calls when promised, straight out lies to your face and always gives you the run around. I will never go back to this location and would strongly discourage you from doing so as well.< /Text>

The best rental place ever. I can give them more than 5starts for their customer service. Its best of best! And trust me, they will not rip u off for this and that added stuffs for the rental. They would not push u to the end and play dirty sales tricks. Sergio dhamadyan is the the agent eho assisted me. I can guarantee that he will do beyond his best to give u a wonderful service. :) ive been renting the car for 2months, and i will always use them to rent a car, as long as i live in the sf valley.</review>

<Text>Good pizza, good service, no fork though. If anything the pizza was adequate and the Munchees are weird, or maybe I just don't like potatoes with my pizza. They only gave me a spoon, and no fork (also none in the hotel, unrelated but WHY?) Being in a hotel you'd think Pizza Guys would remember to bring a fork!? So that garden salad went to waste 😣😭< /Text>< gmapID>

<user_name>Brittany<//user_name><text>This place is the biggest scam! Do not order online either or a 2 medium (2 topping) pizza deal for 18.99 will somehow come out to 49.56! AND I PICKED IT UP! The girl said it was cuz I got thick crust.... so thick crust raises the price 29$? No. The manager even came over and said he would fix it. He gave me a 4$ discount. 45 dollars for two medium, two topping pizzas. Nothing fancy. Nothing special.... unbelievable! I'll never ever come back!< /text></record>

Decent pizza, pretty overpriced on its own but there are good deals on their website for getting pizza cheaply, especially BOGO Tuesdays<//review>

We love Pizza Guys, great pizza at a fair price.  We have had multiple issues ordering online, and ended up getting home with the wrong pizza.  With that said, Oliver, the manager is awesome!! He took care of us after the order mishap, and more importantly, treated us like the most important customers in the world.  Excellent customer service skills and managerial know how.  Always pleased to speak with him, he’s the face of the business..give him a big raise!!<//text>

<Text>Bad experience with this Pizza Guys location. I called in to make my order and they tried charging me full price on a discounted item. Saved $5. Once I got home I realized I was missing an item I paid for. Food was good so don't want to give one star but customer service was atrocious. If you come here, make sure they aren't charging you more money than you should be paying by checking their website for deals and specifically mentioning the deal when you order. And check to see if they give you everything you paid for.<//Text><Rate>2< /Rate>< date>

It was okay. I called at 10:30 am opening for a pizza order and delivery- they couldn't do it by noon. I had to pick up the pizza. They seem a bit unorganized. I ordered 3 large pizzas- They didn't ask about crust. I got tiny, thin crust. I like thick crust but not burnt! Hate when crust is burned. Next time I will look at pizza before I leave and never call if I need delivery asap.< /Text>

I was alone and they wanted me to order enough to feed 4 people! What a racket! I ordered from the pizza factory and they delivered from even further away and I got from them what I attempted to order from the pizza guys. It was A LOT cheaper also and was excellent.

Great service, Oliver was great, awesome personality and by far the best pizza we have had in awhile. The crust was perfect, not doughy or greasy at all and the owner Mike, I must say is also pretty cool. thanks for the pizza, we will be back. If you haven't tried The Pizza Guys in Placerville, you need to, they are a must. Our family gives them 2 thumbs up! Phoned our order in, they and yup they were on time :-)</text>

Do not go to the placerville pizza guys unless you want a giant puddle of grease from Kailee 50 mintues after the 20 mintues they orginally tell you and also she thinks a puddle of grease is standard  completely uselss to not even be able to make a pizza right</text>

<Text>Not only did they get my order wrong, they also got my dads order wrong 3 days after and gave us the wrong pizza. So not only are we angry, another customer is also angry.They are always late, it takes 2 hours to get a pizza. If they weren't the only pizza delivery in placerville, they would have ZERO customers. They consistently get orders wrong, but unfortunately they are the only pizza place around. I don't know who needs to be fired, but there needs to be some changes. I am never ordering from here again, I've had it.< /Text>< Pics>

First off it took 1hr and 45 mins when told it would take 45 min. And then it was wrong covered in pineapple which my brother and don't like on top of being cold. Took another hour and a half to get our right Pizza. They did throw in cinnamon twist which we didn't really eat. Both delivery people were nice and I would give it 2 stars but on top of our Pizza finally getting (3 hours) it really wasn't all that good. I won't be ordering there again.</Text>

Not that good, well anymore because they used to be great but then they started getting orders wrong, cold pizza, and disgusting pizza.

Would not recommend, there are better pizza guys in Folsem, Cameron Park, and a few other places in the area.</review>

I ordered pizza online at 11am asking for delivery at 12:30 It's 12:55 and no pizza and my lunch is over in 5 min. I'm very disappointed I hadn't ordered in awhile and doubt I will be ordering again. Next time I will stick with Roundtable.<//Review>

Reservoir is filled up with water again!
Stayed at the site 199 this summer: very spacious with partial shades. You can get to the shore, bathroom, running water, and dump station within a few min walk. No shower. Bathroom was kept clean throughout three days stay. (Bring your own toilet paper in case they run out)
You get to see bambi few feet away with a pretty good chance, but keep food in the container. They bit through my bags to get my bread and chips!< /Text>

Not nice front desk lady. Rude and short, until I paid her the parking spot money. Would not recommend this place solely on interactions with her. Bad restrooms too, unclean and unsanitary<//text>

Nicely situated in the trees and close to Stampede reservoir. There is some space between the campsites which is nice. No hookups but generators are allowed and there is enough space between the trees to get some solar recharge, and maybe satellite TV. We had weak but mostly consistent Verizon 4G in 245.< /Text>

Great campground and beautiful lake. The sites are spacious. This campground does not have hookups for rvs, however the restrooms areas are clean and well maintained. We’ll definitely stay at this campground again.</Review>

<Text>It is a good campground. Used to have a camp store before the govt took over.  The hosts do a great job of keeping it clean and the toilets well stocked.  With the reservoir close and more full you can pretty much walk to it to swim. Biggest issue for me is other people. I go camping for quiet, others bring the city with them. Music + liquor = fighting.  Must make reservations to get the spot you want.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Definitely have mixed feelings about this campground. I really like the campground itself. Most of the sites seem pretty spacious. We stayed at site #80 and there was a good distance between us and the sites surrounding ours. Not far from the water at all. It was only my first trip to Logger but wow... this place is like a giant dog park. I can honestly say this was the first time I've been camping and woken up several times by dogs barking. Besides one other family across from us, every one of the sites in our general area (probably 10-12) ALL had dogs. Many were unsupervised roaming through our site. Several times people tied their dogs to a tree while they went down to the lake and they barked nonstop. I absolutely love dogs. And I really don't mind seeing them in nature. But it was quite chaotic and not exactly my idea of relaxation. I'll give it another shot sometime because I'd really like to fish, which I didn't get to this time. But I strongly hope for a better experience. If you're someone who enjoys your campground "quiet time" I definitely don't recommend this place if it's commonly like that. Oh... and don't stay at any of the sites closest to the bathrooms. The smell is horrid.<//review>

This is a nice campground. They don't have any showers or trailer hookups. It is far enough away to feel away but still close enough to Truckee and Reno to get supplies that you may have forgotten. There are a lot of nice Beach spot to spend the day.<//Review>

Logger Campground is a nice campground on the south shore of Stampede Reservoir. I did not camp there myself, but did drive thru on a holiday weekend. All the spaces seemed to be filled. I plan to return.</review>

They had not cleaned the bathrooms and we smelled them for 2 days..We had stayed in the exact spot 2 x before without that problem..the toilets are not very close to our site either..Could not open windows  on my camper. We brought it to the attention of someone working at the campground..it was like "huh".. I asked nicely if they would take care of it.... someone on golf cart showed up at the bathrooms, didn't go in and checked a list..the toilets had feces on them. No toilet paper. He didn't even go in to check on them... I tried to flag him down..it was a horrible time and we stay at Stampede all of the time!! Since it is run by a independent company, this campground has gone down the tubes..it's sad...</review>

We enjoyed the fresh air, wind in the trees, deer and Chipmunks. However, if you do not have an RV where you can shower, wash dishes, etc. it can be pretty inconvenient.< /review>

<Date>1582836621953<//Date><Review>I arrive at this outstanding restaurant often since I like the  special atmosphere that is part of this restaurant. The personel is awfuly loyal and professional. The service is pretty efficient. Most important, the food they prepare is highly distinguished. I came often and I was always happy. The cost is fair. I highly suggest this place to all my friends.<//Review><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x80dd2aafa65da94d:0xb4fd27bc21c44cd7</gmap_id><Rate>5<//Rate>< Name>

<Review>We had reservations at 6:30 and arrived here at 6:15.  We were seated shortly after arrival as they were preparing our table, so we didn't have any issues there.  I spent the time looking at the menu that they posted in the window while waiting.  The only issue with the wait is that you cannot wait inside the restaurant (Its quite small). After being seated we were presented with the dinner menu, wine menu, and drink/dessert menu, water and a plate of bread with olive oil.

Nancie has a great attitude, and made me feel really welcome my first time here. I can't tell you how many bartenders I've ran into (with my car.. haha jk) who think they should receive good tips just bc they're attractive. She's not one of those & I appreciate it. She actually tries to do her job.<//Text>

<review>Pretty big place, lots of big screens for the games. Cool atmosphere, friendly staff and pretty chill vibe overall. There are pool tables and plenty of seating for big groups. They have an ok beer selection if that's your thing. Only thing that needs improvement is their whiskey selection.</review><user_name>Jose Ramirez</user_name>< Pics>

<text>Be careful! This place overprices you if you don't pay attention!
Got some gas last night from this place. I happened to have some cash with me so I decided to save few cents by paying by cash. Paid 60 bucks. 2.99 per gallon, math was easy and  I was expecting 20 gallons of gas. But after I finished, it only showed ~18 gallons. I don't usually check receipts, but this was clearly wrong. So I went to the casher again to check what happened. Got a receipt, the prices was 3.29. First the casher insisted nothing was wrong and I should just go. After I took picture of prices from pump and from their sign, he admitted that his manager might set wrong price on that pump, but nothing he could do to fix that. He wrote "manager report" on my receipt, and said his manager lives in MTV if I wanted to report the issue. WOW, of course that was the only right way to get my 2 gallons of gas back, by driving to MTV.
Very disappointed. Bad service, bad management. It's a pity that this place is very close to where I live but I would not come back again.<//text></record>

This place is aweful. Dirty, employee (female) was rude foul mouth and lazy!!! Just list my business for ever. Also, suspicious charge on my card day after purchasing gas here and didn’t use this card since purchasing gas. I’ve submitted fraud charge and told my bank the events. Old card no longer works.< /review>

<text>I don't even go to any other gas stations. Why? Because they always have the lowest prices. Make sure you pay cash.<//text><Date>1564431546487<//Date><resp>None<//resp>< name>

Decent station, good location.  Has squeegees all over.  Charges 6 cents extra per gallon for credit cards, and pumps seemed a little slow.<//review>

Best prices on gas in the Cupertino/Sunnyvale area. And convenient, accessible location. TPumps is right opposite - making it easy to refuel both car AND driver!<//review>

One of the cheaper gas stations in the area - likely due to distance from the highway. Fairly easy to access<//review>

Worst experience at a gas station.
Flickering lights, issues with card reader, and worst of all, super loud annoying ads. Super loud! And no way to mute. On every pump, so they echo around you.
I'm boycotting loud commercials at the pump. Will not be back.<//Text>

<review>Chico Florist ROCKS! I ordered an arrangement for a relative in the Chico area and found the whole process above average. Their website was user friendly, from seeing photo examples of the arrangement I chose to the billing. I ended up having an issue with my payment (I think I entered the wrong card number on accident) and first thing in the morning the next business day I get a call from Krista who let me know they encountered an issue and allowed me to pay over the phone. I was concerned about if this might affect my desired delivery time (that same afternoon) but nope! They were still delivered on time. Mary, who dropped the arrangement off at my sister's address, texted her immediately to say the flowers were dropped off on the table outside when she delivered while no one was home. The description of the flowers were accurate for what arrived. The freshness of the flowers were perfect! I have been told they smell wonderful. All of this was still done right after the busy Easter holiday. I cannot recommend more, I'll certainly be using them again in future.< /review><userid>118188200989812260761< /userid><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOea6V53NGxzginFW14ACJcjPav0ZIkHBqZG2Yl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPNJihrNLl0erEkCgC1i6E2-eUAFuXUxxD271WG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< time>

< review>
I love keeping flower deliveries local and this place did not disappoint!

I ordered the Simply Elegant Spathiphyllum -Small this morning, around 10.30 am. I called to check if delivery would be made today (as I completed missed the fact that I selected today for delivery - I think it auto populated) and it had already been delivered!

The woman I spoke with said, ‘oh yes, the salon! She was not there but the other 2 women showed me to her station and I placed it there for her.’ I mean, she even recanted the delivery - I think that is fantastic!

I will definitely be using Chico Florist again in the future! Thank you so much!< /review>

The lady was super nice! I dont know much about flowers but was looking to get my girlfriend some as a gift. She helped me picked flowers for my girlfriend based on her favorite colors and such. The wrapping was on point too! Price is very fair, and my girlfriend loved it! 10/10 will come back again😁</Text>

Flowers were beautiful! Mary was amazing and so helpful. After explaining what colors i wanted and how much i had to spend she suggested Florist choice. Was not disappointed, best friend loved them, AND  my cost was 1 penny less than I had to spend. Thank you so much</text>

Consistently order arrangements  from them and always receive very creative designs with personal touches and high quality flowers. They even replaced an arrangement recently because some of the flowers were a little rough. It was greatly appreciated and I will continue to order in the future.< /Review>

I ordered flowers for someone in Chico from Chicago.  I asked to have them delivered on Monday.  Shea (from Chico Florist) said "no problem" and that was that.  Turns out Monday was President's Day and a holiday for the florist.  Rather than skip the delivery or call me back to change the delivery, Shea went in to the florist on her day off and delivered them herself.  Where do you find that kind of service?  I highly recommend this florist.< /Text>

Needed to apologize to a friend...with a phone call Krista was able to arrange something colorful and fragrant.  It was delivered promptly and probably saved a friendship!  I really appreciate them prioritizing it for me...It was just hours after and it made a difference!  Family owned and operated for almost 100 years!<//text>

Krista was very patient and understanding with me when I kept changing my flower vision, and she delivered the flowers perfectly on time. Everything was beautiful and exactly what I was hoping for. Plus her prices are far better than most florists around! Highly recommend!</Text>

I ordered 4 leis for a graduation party tonight. We had 4 graduates from 2 different schools. Shey took my order online and checked in with me several times to mkae certain I got exactly what I wanted for the grads.
The leis are absolutely gorgeous. They have lasted all night and probably will for the next few days. They are well made, strong, and they all stayed intact through the limbo, dancing, playing pool, and eating tons of food. 2 are orchid leis and 2 are carnations...both are exquisite.
Thank you so much for helping make some awesome memories for my kids!</Review>

<text>I've used, and had MANY flowers delivered to me from Chico Florist. Each time the service is amazing, the flowers are beyond beautiful and my flowers always stay beautiful and alive for at least a week, usually closer to 2. I've been using her services for the last 4 years and have NEVER been sorry, or disappointed... actually the quality, service and owner are so amazing I'm using them for my wedding this next year. My family, boyfriend and I are all very picky, and expect my flowers to be nothing less than amazing, and each time she arrives at my door I am surprised, and amazed at what she creates and delivers. Always. Would and do recommend to friends 100%<//text>< Pics>

<Text>I use Chico Florist's weekly service for my Automotive Repair shop in Chico.  Every Monday they bring a new arrangement for our front counter. This has been well received by our customers in an otherwise masculine facade of our business.  They are always unique and reflective of the season.  When they exchange the arrangements, the week-old arrangement typically looks just as good as the new one (as long as I do MY job of keeping it watered).  I use them for all of my other gifting and special occasion needs as well.  There service is always professional & courteous, and their flowers are always lush & beautiful.</Text>< GmapID>

I live in Washington State so I was looking for a florist I could count on and trust.  Their was a misunderstanding on the Valentines Day order and the owner was so kind and gracious about it and really wanted to make things right. She immediately sent out at no charge, a bouquet for my moms birthday.
Due to the fact that I live in Washington State,
I am happy to have found a florist I can count on and trust to deliver beautiful arrangements.

< review>
I decided to get some flowers as a simple thank you gesture for my wife and went to Chico Florist. Krista, the owner, asked me about price range and type of flower (from the farm or exotic) and put together what has been the first of quite a few bouquets. The flowers were, what I believe, to be an amazing value and held for some time. Delivery was prompt as well. Each following experience has been the same since.

When I mentioned needing flowers for my mom in Oregon, Krista researched florists in the area and guided them to flowers that I had suggested. Price was no different and the flowers were delivered on time as well. Service from her and her staff are second to none and I would recommend them to anyone.< /review>

Dealership did a total bait and switch. Was working with one of the managers, Brandon, on a deal for a vehicle that he assured me had all the options I wanted. We locked in a price, I got the color I wanted, and then I double checked with him before coming in that it had everything I wanted, and again he assured me it did. I Ubered an hour to the dealership and find out it doesn’t have the options he promised me it had. Then, he said he could find me one with the options I wanted.... but it’ll be more money. What? Or he said I could do a year newer for more money. Total bait and switch. I told him I shouldn’t have to pay for your mistake, especially when we already agreed on a price, and I don’t want to pay more for a vehicle that was supposed to have everything I wanted originally. He wasn’t willing to fix his mistake so I walked away. Very dishonest dealership, would not recommend.< /text>

We made it to Covina Chevy by accident. We were bringing in a Chevy Volt from another dealer for a pre-sale inspection when we spied these two 2014 Sparks. Razi worked with us all afternoon seeing if we could walk away with two cars with our one car budget. It was a complicated afternoon but both cars were in our driveway by 7pm that evening. Bonus points to Razi for bringing Chevy’s sales department all the way to our home in Pasadena so that we could make our appointment to sell our old car, and not have to drive back to Covina to finalize paperwork for our Sparks. A wonderful experience and a big thank you to Covina Chevy for making it all possible!</Review>

We worked with Jose to find our new vehicle and Tyler when we were in finance. When we arrived on Saturday to test drive the new 2021 Trailblazer, Jose was ready and told us all about the cool features in our new ride. We fall in love with this suv but needed more time to think about. Jose called on Wednesday about another trailblazer that just had arrived at his location. We had to go see. Long story short, we left that night with our new 2021 Trailblazer. Tyler moved so quick with finance. He explained everything to us about what we were signing and about what we needed to do next. We left Covina Chevrolet with a full tank of gas and freshly washed SUV! Thank you guys so much for everything.<//review>< Pics>

<Text>Very happy with the service. My sales person, Jose Vasquez was OUTSTANDING!!. He was respectful and very helpful. He took the time to explain the features of the vehicle. He was able to answer all my questions. He was honest in that if he did not know the answer to any question I had he quickly looked into it and would provide an answer.

The finance manager, Alex Ruiz, also very friendly and respectful. He explained all the paperwork with ease. He knew his job well and kept the time down to a minimum, with out rushing, That was good. The final paperwork signing is always long and tedious. Mr. Ruiz went through the process accurately and expeditiously.

Over all very happy with Covina Chevrolet, they get a 10< /Text>< pictures>

<review>I purchased a pre-owned vehicle here and initially was very happy . The tire pressure monitors were broken and I was told that may cost a few hundred to fix. No problem, but it was 500 to fix. Next, The mykey lock was on enabled(max speed and volume lock for teenagers) and I was told a Ford dealer would disable that for free. False. Turns out I needed the “admin key” and was only given the spare key from Chevy. I needed to purchase a new key to disable the teenager mode I was stuck on. New key was $200. On top of that, labor was an additional $180 to program the key and turn off the mykey mode. $821 down and I informed the salesman I was pretty bummed about it. He said he would help, but needed the manager . Days go by and I follow up 3 times. No luck. No care that I was left with petty repairs on a 30k vehicle just days after purchasing it. Thanks Chevrolet!<//review><gmap_id>0x80c3284de6da0bf7:0xc2620d71be97363c</gmap_id>< Date>

I called in and made an appointment for 3 for a spark plug change and the rep told me it would take an hour to a hour and half. I get there at 2:45 and the rep started to check me in and I told him I have an appointment at 3 he asked what service I was getting i let him know a spark plug change he said ok are waiting i said yes and he said the truck won't be done I said why he said they close at 4. So I told him what was the point of making an appointment and why did they schedule it he said he didn't and just saud no he can't get it done so I left horrible customer service!!!!!< /Text>

<review>Recently bought a car from this dealership and 9 days later the alternator broke down.  Now can't even get a conversation from anyone there.
They're all nice when they're hoping you buy a car from them but impossible to get help from them after. Very disappointed in this Chevy dealership. Will never go here again.</review>< time>

I was greeted as soon as I stepped foot onto the lot. The sales consultant that helped me is named Luis R. He was very kind, he definitely was incredibly knowledgeable about the vehicle I was interested in, he was able to answer all my questions without hesitation, great attitude, very upbeat and friendly. The showroom was extremely clean, not a single spec of dust to be found. Overall the atmosphere of this place was very welcoming, very inviting, I definitely felt comfortable while being here. I have been to other locations while looking for a new vehicle and by far this one was my favorite. I definitely recommend this location.< /Review>< pictures>

<gmap_id>0x80c3284de6da0bf7:0xc2620d71be97363c</gmap_id><text>This place was the worse .. I did all my paperwork on a car that which I had already been there all day . When done with the paperwork the salesman ask me to redo saying another customer wanted my car since it was the one she test drove which was had a better engine so for doing this they promised me a life time of free oil changes but than sold company to someone else which meant they could honor the oil changes anymore . Not only that they pretend that your credit is bad but never disclosing what it actually is so that u feel hopeless and settle for the interest rate they suggest . So please know credit score if going there . Also, the warranty was over so quickly even with an extension. I felt like these people were scammers from start to finish. I would go to car max or anywhere else over this place.. when paying off your car early you would think it would be lower but for some reason with this place it is not .. don’t make the mistake I made of going there they act like they are on your side but they are not I dealt with a nelson Cruz and manager Michael unsure if still there but they messed it up for me and anyone I know from going back there..</text><Name>Jamisha Nelson</Name>< Rate>

Liked the car we test drove, except for the salesman (Ruben). Told us absolutely nothing about the car and was a bit rude during the test drive. The way he was speaking to us made it seem like we were interrupting his day and taking up his time.<//text>

<text>BEWARE OF THIS DEALERSHIP!!! THEY HAVE SOME REAL SNAKES WORKING THE LOT!! I got the call that the 2021 Custom Silverado w/ a standard box I had been waiting for a month now had just came in. I called back an hour later to make my walk-in appointment to come in and purchase it. RAY assured me it was there so I made my way. After an HOUR drive there, I come to find out they had already sold it earlier that day. I told the salesman helping that I was just told it was there. He was like sorry about that and I was like why would you tell me it was here and to come down. So I decided to settle for a short box instead since they had a pretty good online price on it of just over $40k. When I told the salesman I wanted that one for the online price, he said that was only  for prior lease customers.  I told him that the price shown does not include the $1500 he is talking about but a Chevy discount all dealers are promoting, he was like NO you gotta read the fine print. I told him I did and I sure as hell know what I'm talking about. I told him I was not going to waste my time and argue with him. So I took off. Today I went online to see if I had missed something about that chevy offer and low and behold! The dealer had changed the price by $5000!! The truck went from $40k+ to $45k+!! The dealer is calling it a market adjustment!! Hahaha EFF THAT!! Now I only think what other kind of F@CKERY tgwy would have tried to get me for if I didn't know the process. They were still going to add some RIDICULOUS dealership fees after the net cost.  Don't be fooled, do your research before making any arrangements anywhere.  That's your hard earned  money we are talking about. In the thousands too!! Stay woke!!</text>< Pictures>

Worst dealer ever!! They sell you cars that haven't passed safety inspection.  Then they can't offer you an equivalent car. Worst of all they put the blame on you in writing they state unable to verify applicant information.  That's BS. My husband has excellent credit and had been pre approved and couldn't take the car home because the wind shield had a  crack and they were going to replace it and detail the car. When we called to check status they said they couldn't go through with the deal because the car was not safe to sell. When we went in for explanation no one knew anything.  Everyone passing the blame of course. Now I thank God.  Will never buy from them.  Same day we went to Encino and bought a better car.< /Review>

<Text>Terrible Service Department! I've brought my car here numerous times and their customer service portion of the Service department is terrible. They do not offer rentals, and they often will do shuttle to drop you off but will not pick you up when your car is done. DO NOT GO HERE FOR SERVICE - GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. Puente Hills Chevrolet owns Covina Chevrolet. Pick Sierra Chevrolet in Duarte or Glendora Chevrolet.< /Text>< Pictures>

Nice people and quick service for an oil change and tire rotation. Used an online special to get the price down to make it reasonable. My one issue would be is that they underinflated my tires after rotation or didn't check. All 4 were at or below 29 psi and should had been set at 34. When thw weather got cold i had to do all 4 myself but not big of a deal. Just inconvenient.< /text>

Before arriving at Covina Chevy and working with Chris Garces  I went to Victorville Chevy on Dos Palmas and had a horrible experience. I called Chris told him what I wanted and about my experience earlier that day. He made sure I was comfortable with the process and got me everything I wanted. He was transparent about the cost of the vehicle, rebates, taxes and fees even before arriving at the dealership. The other dealer was unwilling to give me this information unless I applied for their financing. Chris was very patient with all of my questions, found the vehicle I wanted, gave me cost and walked me through every step of the process.  I asked for transparency and got it. From start to finish I had an awesome experience buying my first Chevy. I would highly recommend Covina Chevy and Chris Garces! Thank you Chris!</Text></record>

Great at selling vehicles. Bought my truck a month ago and still can't get my all season floor mats owed to me. I was told they ordered them and they would call when they arrived. Two weeks later with no phone call I went to dealership. I was told they had them, but manager didn't have key to parts dept. Went back next day 1/2 hour later nobody knows how but they are missing. I called for the manager the next 2 days and was told leave a message. 5 days later no phone call no floor mats.  Here is your survey!< /review>

<review>My experience was very smooth. I looked you up online, answered a few questions regarding my vehicle purchase preference and other basic info questions you needed answered then, I submitted my application and in a few hours I had Luis calling me. I must say, Luis was the most pleasant people person. Very clear and patient with my questions and answers. But mostly, sympaththtic to my car needs. I never felt rushed nor overwhelmed with any of the paperwork. Your entire staff and especially Luis and Joseph at W. Covina Chevrolet welcomed me with a big smile and opened arms. They both worked really hard in making it possible for me to bring home my new ("2020 Chevy Spark in black")whom I've nicknamed "Pulgita". I thank you all but especially Luis and Joseph for making what I thought would be impossible, "POSSIBLE"!!!!. I am forever grateful!!.<//review><response>{'time': 1598397123969, 'text': "Thanks for highlighting some of our staff who helped make this such a great buying experience!

Not pushing trying to make the sale sooner than later
I ended up getting a good discount.

I would defensively be back to by my next car and will recommend Covina Chevrolet to others.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>{'time': 1605569211193, 'text': 'Your satisfaction is important to us, so we want to sincerely thank you for choosing Covina Chevrolet and we hope to see you again soon!'}< /resp><gmapID>0x80c3284de6da0bf7:0xc2620d71be97363c< /gmapID></record>

First of all and mainly most of all, the customer service that I received at Covina Chevrolet was outstanding. Before arriving at Covina I had just left Chevrolet dealer of puente hills where I was treated with total disrespect and unprofessional personnel. I was so upset when I left puente hills, but thanks to Covina Chevrolet customer services made up for all my disappointments and bad moments. Thanks again!! One more thing I wanted to add is that at end of day the key to customer service satisfaction is how you get treated and Covina Chevrolet has that!!!!!<//review>

We brought our 2017 Chevy Cruze in due to check engine light, Stabilitrak light and loss of power. They determined it was a blown piston. Luckily for us it was covered under factory warranty, so after repairs were done we basically have a new car now!  We are very "HAPPY" about that.The technician Roger Bartling kept us informed and was very professional and knowledgeable. We definitely recommend this dealership!< /text>

<review>I was dealt with professionally and respectfully.  There was no high pressure sales pitch.  Everything was explained in detail.  The representative (Christopher Garces) worked hard to maximize our eligibility for rebates.  The remaining staff was extremely courteous and helpful.  All of our questions were answered.  The dealership itself was clean and all staff took the appropriate COVID precautions such as always wearing masks, distancing, and providing hand sanitizer.  We were allowed to test drive without a salesperson in the vehicle.</review>< pics>

DO NOT SERVICE YOUR VEHICLES HERE. I went into the Covina Chevrolet Dealership on December 23rd for a scheduled 8am for a routine oil change and tire rotation. Upon arrival to the dealership I was helped by a service member who inspected my car before taking my key to begin services. During this inspection NO DAMAGE was reported to the interior of my car when I dropped it off. Roger left a message stating the vehicle was ready for pickup. I returned to the dealership at 10:30am to pick up my car. Once, I arrived home and was out of my car I reached in to grab my purse and realized there was an approximate 1 to 1 1/2 inch cut on the driver seat caused at the Covina Chevrolet Dealership. I promptly drove back and was helped by the same service member. He came out to inspect the damage to my leather seat and said I would have to wait for his service director who was busy at the moment. I waited about 20 minutes for the service director Shaun Burkel. The entire interaction with Mr. Burkel, was horrible and I am still in disbelief at how such an ill mannered and unprofessional individual could be "in charge". At no point did Mr. Burkel attempt to understand or remedy the situation. He immediately began to blame me for the damage asserting that it must be peeling because my car is old and when I sit it somehow "pinches" itself. That is not even remotely possible considering the leather cannot pinch itself as it is to the left of the driver seat. In addition the claim that my car is "old" is widely inaccurate as the vehicle is less than five years old. Mr. Burkel belittled and disregarded the very real concern regarding the damage to my seat caused by one of his employees. He began roughly smashing the seat with his hands in an attempt to show some sort of pinching that he could replicate to illustrate his point. I even sat in the car to show how impossible his claim was. His response was "well as the service director I can tell you I am not accepting responsibility for the damage". He at no point listened to my concerns or the fact that the damage appears to have occurred with a sharp tool (which the service department staff carry), and coincidently appeared after being service. I've attached a picture below to document the damage on my leather seat in which you can clearly see it is a precise and straight cut that looks nothing like peeling or pinching as the service director Shaun tried to say it was. It is very obvious that he tried to steam roll over my concerns because I am a younger woman and did not have his "30 years of experience" that he was so adamant about expressing to me. When I asked for a supervisor or corporate number his response was "there's no one above me, this is it". I find it very hard to believe that there is no one else I could speak with and submit a complaint to. I was forced to contact my parents who the car belongs to only then would he provide them with a corporate number which I had previously asked for and he vehemently refused to give me. He repeatedly said "we're done here" and dismissed the fact his staff damaged my leather car seat. This is the worst customer service experience I have ever had and find it extremely unprofessional that he could not take responsibility for damage caused by the service department. It is clear as day that an employee in the service department caused the damage to the driver seat. The damage clearly pictured below is a fine straight cut and not "peeling or pinching" caused over time. As he so adamantly repeated himself in his 30 years experience "cracks" in the leather are normal wear and tear this was not a crack or caused by normal wear and tear but rather a sharp object to one specific area. The initial inspection to my car reported NO DAMAGE to the interior of my car and yet when my car was returned there is obvious damage to my leather seat. (see below) Will be filling complaint with BBB and Chevrolet corporate office.</Text>

My dad and I we’re on the market to get a new work truck for our business we were originally going to CarMax but the truck we wanted to purchase was sold so our back up plan was Covina Chevrolet. The receptionist was friendly and answered all my questions. Mr. Thomas our salesmen made the process extremely smooth! We were there no more than 2 hours which is great! All in all The team down at Covina Chevrolet are great & I highly recommend this dealer.<//text>

<text>Great experience!  I was nervous about car buying during COVID, but my car was totaled so I needed a car.  Luis and Katherine were great - responded to my e-mail inquiry within minutes, and then worked with me on the credit app and negotiating price & rates online & by phone.  Then, Luis, Katherine and manager Ray got all the documents ready for my appointment, so I signed everything in 15 minutes - record time!!!

Also, I felt very safe, everyone wearing masks, plastic shields in front of the desks where I had to sign the paperwork, sanitizer stations. Thank you so much!

One negative, Fox News was playing in the lobby.  Please fix this - it's as though you're advertising that the shop is pro-Trump. In normal times, I would walk out and go elsewhere. Maybe try the Discovery Channel or ESPN, or anything else.

Definitely the easiest car buying experience I've ever had!! And I love my new Equinox, it's absolutely perfect!<//text>< pics>

We just walked out with a 2020 Blazer. Thomas Was very helpful and never hesitated to help us out and gave us some personal tips as well. Thank you so much for all your help. We had a rough negotiation with rey but at the end we are very thankful for all his back and forth with our attorney (my dad lol. They gave him a nickname). Highly recommended, great customer service!!!!!</Text>

My 2010 Chevy HHR has been my favorite car I’ve ever owned, and when it began to show troubled signs; I took it in for an inspection. I cannot thank my service associate, Roger, enough for taking all the appropriate measures in looking into the issues of my HHR. He addressed them very professionally and thoroughly, working above and beyond to help me.<//Review>

The entire staff over at Covina Chevrolet is extremely kind and helpful. Special shout out to Luis Ruiz who assisted me with purchasing my vehicle. He was very professional and took the time to show me different options. Would highly recommend to anyone that is looking to purchase a vehicle to contact Luis Ruiz.</review>

<rating>5</rating><Text>We came in to get an inspection on a car from LA Auto Exchange - where we had a bad experience - and during the time that the car was inspected, we found two used cars that interested us. Razi took us for some test drives and then gave us the hard sell - we didn't take it seriously at first, but then we walked out of there from a bad experience at LA Auto to a good one at Covina Chevy. Razi went out of his way to make us happy, meet our budget and accommodate our needs - big ups to him.

Covina stole us from another dealership and it was great.

I do want to say that I'm not a fan of the Stargard GPS system - they install it on every vehicle and use it as a profit margin technique. I understand dealerships have to make their money, and he did discount it for us but that still kinda sucks. Still, their customer service earned 5 stars!< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

I have really excellent service at Covina Chevy. The receptionist was polite and honest and so was Chris Garses my sales person. Very honest about the vehicle and little to no negotiation needed for great prices. They did everything that they could do and went above and beyond! Recommend this dealership high and will have more business with them. Has a few small issues but dealership is going above and beyond to fixing it. I extremely recommend them. Thank you so much for the 2017 Dodge Grand Caravan</Review>

I was just here looking to get into a Camaro and literally was told to come back tomorrow because they get cranky if they don't leave by 9 my husband literally told them we were looking to buy right then and there. I will never be coming back to this place there was a guy Eddie who patiently helped us but by that time the desire to conduct business with them was gone. I understand you are trying to get home but I'm telling you I'm not looking to waste your time and you still don't want my business okay I'll take it elsewhere

Update 7/23/2019 bought a Cadillac great service treated like royalty eager to earn our business. Leasing two more vehicles wasn't looking to waste your time next time learn to help every single customer<//Text>

Me and my husband had been looking for a truck for our son after months of looking we finally found one here. I called to ask if they could give me a better price because it did have a lot of miles on it for how old it was and they did but it wasn't enough to get to where we needed it so I said could you do a little better and they said well because there is stargard on it we can't bring the price down it costs 2500 to have it on there. I said what's stargard and they said it's software thats been installed on the truck and my husband asked if they could take it off that we didn't want it and they said no they can't and I said ok well if you guys would come down a little more just do we would be within our budget that would be great.  But they said they couldn't but that they would leave the stargard on it for the lower price! I said awesome well take it! I initially was talking with Razi but he was on his day off when the transaction occurred so I was talking with Rey the finance manager he assured me the truck was in excellent condition.  My husband went down for a test drive and found out that the windshield had to chips out of it and the center counsel had a big hole.  but he drove it anyway and said it drove nicely we made some deals with them to fix the glass and replace the center counsel and they did! I was happy! A couple days later I texted Rey to ask about the stargard he said it takes a couple of weeks to get it transferred i said ok no problem.  So here we are today i texted Ruben who is the guy that delivered the truck to us.  I asked him can you let me know what's going on with the stargard he said yeah let me talk to Rey and I'll get back to you.  I said ok.  I text him a couple hours later and he said he'll have Rey call me. Rey called me alright and all I heard was we didn't charge you for it i said but you weren't suppose to charge us it was in the price of the car and you said it couldn't be Uninstalled. And he said you weren't charged for it! I said I knew this was going to happen.  I said Rey your lying that was not the deal you said it was included in the price and that it would be transferred in 2 weeks he said what are you talking about it can't be transferred.  I said that what you told me he started yelling at me i said please stop yelling at me! And he said you weren't charged so I said that's fine what's the general manager name and he says it while raising his voice and i said thanks and hung up! Whatever you do get everything in writing that you ask for because they are snakes that work here and I will not be taking my business and I will write a review wherever I need to so people know what kind of stuff goes on here!  DON'T BELIEVE ANYTHING YOU ARE TOLD FROM REY OR RUBEN THEY ARE CONIVERS! BLATANT LIARS!! I will be going to the better business bureau, Facebook, yelp, consumer affairs and whoever else i have to!!!< /Text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>We came into Covina Chevy to look at a Hyundai they had on their lot because my Hyundai had been totalled 2 weeks earlier. Jose, the sales person we met with, took his time helping us test drive the Hyundai we were looking at and after I realized that wasn't the car for me he walked the lot to see if there was anything that might interest us. I ended up test driving a used Chevy Equinox, which I had never considered before, but fell in love with it. I even left the dealership to test drive other cars to be sure this was the one for me and Jose was supportive the whole time. I ended up coming back and getting the Chevy Equinox and the process was not difficult at all. I told them what I wanted and they weren't pushy about adding additional items or warranties and it made the experience less stressful. Definitely recommend working with this team!< /text>< Pics>

Good News.  Amazing Selection, Excellent Prices, and Helpful Staff!

Bad News.  1 Month has passed since I purchase the car and this happens.
I Purchase the car Cash so I know what they're going to say it's not our problem. I contacted Chevy Customer services and they said that someone repainted the car.  Working with my Extended warranty to get this fixed.</text>

<Text>I truly appreciate the staff at Covina Chevrolet. From the time I walked into the dealer, to the delivery of my truck to my home every person I met or talked to was extremely helpful and pleasant to work with. Jose Vasquez helped me find the truck I've always wanted and also went out of his way to deliver it to my home. Jose, Ray, Eddie, contract signing and the front desk team made the process easy and communicated all the information I needed before I arrived at the dealer to make the purchase process easy for me. I look forward to when people ask me about my awesome truck and I get to tell them to see the team at Covina Chevrolet, they'll take care of you! Wishing the team there much success and thank you all for excellent customer service it means a lot.</Text>< username>

< review>
The Good:

Bought a Malibu Hybrid about a week ago. I had a wonderful experience in sales. Everyone worked with me to get a deal that my wife and I were comfortable with. Even helping with my trade in and being more generous with it's value then other dealers.  I was even given a loaner while my car was in service. I would definitely purchase a vehicle here again.

The Bad:

Now for the bad. While the experience with sales was amazing, service is lacking the same experience. During my delivery prep service discovered that there was a recall and a part was needed. It's been a week now and service hasn't even begun to work on my vehicle. Sales has kept me updated but service has dropped the ball. You would think after a week that my car would have been ready. I guess new customers/sold vehicles are not priority. Once I FINALLY receive my vehicle I will NOT be bringing it back for service and will not recommend anyone visit this location for anything other then sales.< /review>

<Rating>2<//Rating><Text>Our 2014 Cruze diesel water pump and thermostat went out (under warranty) and we took it here for repairs. This was during the GM strike and parts were unavailable, so our car was with them for 49 days. Which we understood we didn't complain since we had a loner. But once we actually got our car back we were able to drive the car home but unable to start it 2 days later since they failed to charge and maintain the battery and its now dead, there was no coolant in the reservoir, and we were missing the undercarriage cover. We called to complain but were told it was not their responsibility, then we called corporate to complain and were able to get our car towed back to the dealer. Now we are told since the battery is not GM there is nothing they can do and a new one will be at our cost, the coolant was not filled by them which they will now correct and the undercarriage cover needs to be ordered since they are unable to locate it. Now I can understand human error and can understand something being missed but 3 huge errors like this is unacceptable. 1) my car was in their care for over a month and any decent mechanic knows that batteries need to be maintained, 2) we brought them an overheating vehicle with a huge coolant leak and it was returned with no coolant!, and 3) a huge plastic piece was missing from the underside of the car in which they asked us 3 times if we took off. This service department is completely incompetent and once we get our car back we will not be coming back.

Update: Chevy gave us a used battery. For that I'll add another star</Text>< pictures>

We had a great experience at Covina Chevrolet thanks to our salesman Christopher Cueva .
Chris and the rest of the employees were very informative & helpful .  We stopped by to check out SUV options and after he showed us a few we decided on the one.   We are happy with our Suburban because there is enough room to fit  8-9 people,   2 kids & 7 adults to be exact and a lot of trunk space which means more family trips< /review>

<Rating>1< /Rating><review>The after sale service is bad! Never received my registration more than 4 months now! And the car plate is expired too. I can’t even drive this car legally. I’ve tried to contact people in the office at least 10 times, but none of them will answer the phone or keep transferring me to different departments! When you go buy a car, you will feel the excellent service here, but once the deal is done, the excellent customer service is gone as well!<//review>< Pictures>

<Review>Mr. Luis Ruiz was kind, authentic and I genuinely felt he wanted the best for me. He was personable and had a warm disposition.

I have purchased many cars and have dealt w/many salesmen and Mr. Ruiz was by far the most kind, non pushy and did not come off as a salesperson but rather, more like a close friend.

I Will ABSOLUTELY, refer family and friends to your dealership, more specifically, to Mr. Ruiz.

GOD Bless you on all your future endeavors and Thank you for your kindness,

Well, I received calls regarding this service that my car needed, and I was told it was the 1st service and it was free since it was the 1st time that I was going to the dealership. They called me at least 5 times, so I was OK, I'm going to try it since I've been always having problems with the dealerships and I didn't wanted to. So, I went and they charged me and I was like really? and he told me yeah, due to your millage you need to pay, so I did but I'm never coming back since I don't like to be lied to.<//text>

I dealt with Razi, he seemed like a nice guy so I’m not sure if it’s him or the management. I would not recommend doing business with this company the price was listed online as an Out the door price (OTD) then they tried to get me for almost $2000 more. The truck I was interested in was listed just under $24,200 before I contacted them</review>

Overall painfully unpleasant experience, the manager was rude and pushy--talked down to us as being 'sales-y' when we were only trying to be honest and transparent with our budget. All he had to do was tell us he couldn't match what we were looking for, and we would've walked away, there was no need for the condescension and belittlement we experienced. In the end, he accused us of having taken too much of his time and retracted the earlier offer he had made. Eddie, the sales rep we were initially talking to, did try his best and we don't blame him at all...but the manager really ruined our day. Recommend you take your business elsewhere.

Thankfully, Johnny at LA Auto Exchange helped us secure a wonderful deal, all the while being extremely honest and helpful!< /Text>

My wife and I had a wonderful painless experience with Covina Chevrolet. Our salesman Tomas was not only easy to deal with he was very helpful to explain everything so we could understand. I also want to mention Christopher who handled many questions I had on the phone today. He was swift to get back with me and explained that covina would handle my requests immediately. We are very happy with Covina Chevrolet and their employees are top notch.<//Text>

Visited the dealership on a Sunday morning to look at a 2019 Camaro SS. Was greeted by Hassan who then later after being able to work with me to meet a monthly payment that was doable and much more, I’m very happy to say that I was able to walk out with a 2019 Camaro SS. The car did have some minor dings and scratches, however, the manager made the promise to get them fixed for me w no charge. Overall a great dealership with great staff. Would definitely recommend this dealership and salesman to friends and family.👍🏼 🤙🏼<//Text>

After  15 years of loyalty we have to go to  another  brand because Chevrolet decided to  discontinue the Volt and try to  force customers into the  Bolt. Our lease is up and so is our loyalty.  Leased the  2019 Ford Fusion Titanium energi with both EV and  gas💕<//review>

Great experience buying from this place compared to other off label dealers. Thomas the sales dealer made the sale easy and navigated me to the right truck for me. As a second time truck buyer I can appreciate when someone takes the time to hear my needs. The service department has also been very good in maintaining my two trucks. I am very happy with their service.< /review>

<Text>First of all there is new ownership at Covina Chevrolet. Very impressed with all the staff here. We were greeted by everyone and they all made you feel apart of the family. We had a special circumstance with our previous car. Mason, Richard, and Darrel were able to make a great deal. Thank you all at Covina Chevrolet.</Text>< resp>

<Text>Mechanic left oil all over the underside of my truck after an oil change. Had to go back to get the mess he left cleaned! Should've had him clean up all the residue oil spilled on my garage floor! 4 hours for an oil change with an appointment, and a 2 hour wait time for them to clean up their mess! Total inconvenience!

Came in for an oil change and was greeted by Victor the manager here. He’s a great guy and made sure I got the help I needed. The workers here are very nice and helpful. While I was waiting for my oil change to be done I was greeted by Aaron who made sure I was doing okay and if I needed anything. This place is one of the best places to have your car serviced because of the staff is so helpful and they get the job done quick.< /review>

This dealership is not very good at responding back to you on important matter I have been trying to leave messages and voicemails for a week and have not received any call back. I would highly recommend going to a different dealership, my vehicle I purchased from them had been in some kind of damage from being in their lot and when I got my truck they never told me about it so after trying to sell it I come to find out my Carfax report there was a damage report and am having a hard time selling</Review>

< review>
The city of Covina has a problem. I'm not referring to the traffic or polluted air we breathe every day. The problem seems to be a lot more difficult to get rid of.

The problem is Covina Chevrolet.

Covina Chevrolet has become highly skilled at dispensing misery for a premium price. I was not expecting great service, but I never expected to witness such contempt for the customers they serve.

My situation with Covina Chevrolet is miserable and ongoing, but I've discovered that it is far from isolated. There are many other folks like myself who cannot even get a simple phone call.

But this is precisely their company culture. Covina Chevrolet has an 'F' rating with the Better Business Bureau and has been charged by the FTC for truly abhorrent sales practices. They had become so adept at exploiting their most vulnerable customers that they failed to notice when their behaviors had become criminal.

Misbehavior persists, until this day, because they know that many customers are unable to properly articulate their grievances. Such phenomenal managerial arrogance to ignore the basic lessons of decency from the MJL and Sage days.

You, the consumer, have many wonderful options around the San Gabriel Valley for car servicing. Whatever your automobile needs might be, Covina Chevrolet does not have the answer. By supporting their operations, you enable them to continue defrauding the San Gabriel Valley of its sanity.

The market should be cleared for those who can compete with integrity. You have the right to be treated with respect, whether or not you have the capacity to complain.</review>

< Review>
After negotiating price with sales person, I was informed that there was additional cost for dealer added equipment to the tune of $1300. After objecting to this last minute "extra charge" I got a $300 discount. Not happy about it but agreed to go forward with purchase. I asked if I needed to put money down to hold the truck and was told no....they would hold it for me. I was supposed to pick up the truck this morning and was 5 minutes away from dealer when I got a call informing me that the dealer sold the truck to someone else. No one should go through such uncertainty. Dont buy from these busters.</Review>

Under New Management!  I was looking to buy a used Chevy Spark. They had one at this dealer. But when I was doing my research, I saw that they had terrible reviews. This is NO LONGER THAT PLACE! The person I first started with, Roger,  was sweet and professional. When I was freaking out about buying a car after having mine for 25 years, he was right there! I went to look at the used car I had picked and when I got there they had a new one for me to test drive. So you figure that is their job, right, to sell new cars! But after the test drive with Andy, who is so funny, and knows his cars, I was in love with it!  They worked so hard to make that car fit into my budget, and it did!!! Edward, the financial manager MADE IT FIT!  He was amazing! Arianna, the woman you sign the papers with was so knowledgeable about everything about the car,  what's covered and how to get all of that done. They work together as an amazing team! The only problem I had was 1/2 my fault, 1/2 theirs. When I bought my first car they did not have Gap Insurance. And in all of my research I did not come across that, so I did not ask for it, and I believe it was just an oversight on their part that they didn't tell me either. So, I had to go back the next day to sign, and Edward had added the insurance, but had gotten my payment even lower! That is just how they roll! :D I am totally in love with my brand new car, and feel safe and secure again. They made this a very good experience for me! I highly recommend!!< /review>

I took my 2017 truck in for an oil change. No oil leaks prior to the visit. I picked it up and noticed oil on my driveway. Took it back to service dept, was told that its "residual oil" and that it was cleaned up. The next day there is still "residual oil" dripping. Busy people like myself don't have time for this bs, no body should have to deal with this ordeal especially when you are paying $145+ for this service.<//Text>

< review>
I received excellent service from Sage Covina Chevrolet. Service Advisor Ray Najera knocked it out of the park for me. I admit I was pretty stressed.   I'm here traveling from out of state and needed emergency work on my truck. Ray did everything possible to make my experience a good one. He was professional and gracious. Service was timely. I was pleasant surprised to learn that they solved my problem without costing me an arm and a leg. Unfortunately, it's easy to worry that repair shops will rip you off if they get a chance. Not these guys. They proved their integrity to me! Thank you Ray and all of Sage Covina Chevrolet! You are now my GO TO Chevy dealer and service provider in LA!!!< /review>

Came in to look at 2016 traverse which was parked In first row of lot. Vehicle was filthy inside. After taking test drive I found out reason why. Dealership really needs to not allow staff to use used vehicles for road trips. I decided to take for a test drive anyways. Maybe to only ask for price reduction, new floor mats, and cleaning with deal. While test driving I started to smell brake fluid from a/c vents. Decided to not but. Beware of used vehicles here. Make sure you are knowledgeable in Chevrolets so called 172 point inspection of CERTIFIED CHEVROLET vehicles. This is second Chevrolet dealer (Rotolo Chevrolet) that I've been to that states their vehicles are inspected but yet both 2016 traverse had issues with brakes.<//review>

I absolutely love this Chevrolet family, everyone here was so helpful and amazing! As a member in the U.S. Air Force they offered all possible avenues to get the car of my dreams!

The hood and bumper was repainted front grill replace front left finder replace with after marked parts.Windsheild was replaced of rock chip he told me. All the bolts in front end were falling out very dishonest sell guy and team of crooks the bumper paint doesn't even match save your time and tell everyone you know to avoid covina Chevy .If you want to be lied to and ripped off this is the place for you .Please spread the word this place has dishonest employees don't care about you or your safety there just in it for the money .</text>

I would honestly look else where for a vehicle after coming here.. I got scammed to say the least.. Was told this Chevy Silverado pick up truck had a clean car fax. When I arrived home from a two hour drive from their stealership.. I notice they used black paint to cover up all the rust located on the frame, control arms, rear diff, leaf springs, drive shaft.. I would highly advise going to rydell Chevy after this.. I even tried talking to the owner of the dealership but supposedly he was never in town to take calls..<//Text>

I  recently purchased a 2019 Chevy spark,I really wanted a small car and something I could afford.  Christopher Cuevas Which was a person that showed me the car that let me test drive it  and showed me that it was affordable for me.  He really did take his time and effort to sell me the car he was really polite  and knows how to  communicate.  I didn’t think I was able to take out the car but I did. He made it happen it took some time but sure enough I took out my car and I was very happy and pleased about it.  I would recommend anybody to go to Covina Chevrolet and talk to Christopher Cuevas because I know that he would work with them and give them a car that they can afford and that they would be happy with. I want to thanks Christopher Cuevas  because without him I wouldn’t have this car right now so thank you very much .</review>

If I could give less than a star I would - this has been the worst experience of buying a car in all my years of life.  Leased a volt, turned in another lease to the dealer to return to GM for processing.  They never helped me with the clean vehicle stickers, and they never sent in the vehicle return receipt so GM Financial billed me over $500!  I tried like hell to get the dealership to submit the VRR, they never even got back to me after 100 phone calls.  If you deal with this dealership, your in for a huge ride of pain - I warned you!< /Text>

They are extremely terrible in their service both with customer service and actual service.... I knew I shouldn't have gone here. I was getting a couple parts replaced they quoted me for 2-3 hours.. confirmed by phone prior to my appointment and jn person. I left for 3.5 hours and got s phone call they would need at least another hour or asked me to come back another day. I could not believe that after waiting this long they would just ask me to come back.... if you value your time I would not suggest you come to this dealer.< /text>

<review>This is the worst service I have ever experienced. I went for just an oil change with an appointment and waited over 2.5 hours. The service rep. Jessica was so rude, when I expressed why so long of a wait time her excuse was what do you expect it's the holidays. Sorry but the holiday doesn't have much to do with an oil change. She has no customer service skills. I would not recommend this place at all. Never again. Will be filing a complaint with corporate< /review>< Pictures>

They seemed nice enough at first. However, they hired these high school looking kids which are just rude and condescending. Again, thinking they might just be young and inexperienced, I tried to let it go. Unfortunately, their seasoned sales aren't any better.

<text>I bought a new Corvette from Covina Chevrolet back in July. It's been over 3 months and I still haven't received my 2nd key. Eddie has promised over and over that they will get it to me, but it is just lip service. I finally get a call a week ago to come in to pick up the key. Then they call me right back telling me the key is on back order and to ignore the previous call. This dealer is a joke. I gave them so many chances to make it right, but they just don't care.</text><UserId.>100515541108975988656<//UserId.><resp>None< /resp><pics>None<//pics><rate>1< /rate><Gmap_id>0x80c3284de6da0bf7:0xc2620d71be97363c<//Gmap_id>< username>

<Text>I went into Covina Chevy to test drive a 2017 Chevrolet Camero. To my surprise the customer service I received from Joey was exceptional. He greeted me, gave me specific details on the Camero, and most importantly he listened to my concerns about the vehicle. I will definitely come back for my next car purchase. I highly recommend Joey at Covina Chevrolet. Thank you Joey!<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x80c3284de6da0bf7:0xc2620d71be97363c<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I had the pleasure of working with Mike this past Saturday. I went in to the dealership and within 10 minutes I was already over it and wanted to get out- but Mike came along and totally turned that around. Mike made my visit to the dealership a stress-free one. He was very kind, professional and treated me like family. From the moment he stepped in and took over my inquiry to the time I left with my new truck he made sure I was comfortable and taken care of.</text>

Horrible, if I could rate it a zero I would. I had called to inquire about a Corvette and was told to come down and test drive. When I came down the sales manager says our policy is no test drives on Corvette’s. Who would seriously purchase a $100k car without test driving it, a complete waste of time. So I went to Sierra Chevrolet and they let me test drive the car with my wife no issues, Sergio was great and the entire staff was pleasure to work with. I drove home with my Z06 and will continue to do business with them in th future.

Don’t waste your time with Covina Chevrolet!  Go to another dealer that value their potential customers.< /Text>

I have leased many vehicles and received mediocre service; however, my wife and I had a very satisfying encounter with the lease service. Alonzo was the utmost professional in answering questions and making the leasing process and ease. My wife and I  left the dealership with satisfying peace.<//text>

I came in for parts today, when I drove in a salesman named Andy greeted me and asked me what I needed helped with. I told him i just needed parts, unlike other dirty salesman that would just ignore you and turn away, Andy walked me inside and treated me well. Great customer service here.</Review>

My 2014 Chevy Malibu LTZ was performing well until it reached roughly 90k Miles. I have a consecutive history with maintenance at Firestone until I started experiencing engine failure after Eco Stop would engage. With numerous returns to Firestone & them renting me a car, they could not find the issue & recommended I take it to the dealer. Due to my research there is over 140k Malibu's that have known Eco Stop issue; however, GM only posted a Service Bulletin & not a recall (for an unknown reason) to take it on case by case basis. Chevy Forums (which I recommend anyone with a problem in your GM vehicle to look at) other Chevy Malibu consumer's stated similar issues with no help from the Dealer/Manufacturer. Typical wheel & deal on minor repairs but never a conclusion to the issue leaving them stuck.

For the record, I drive at least 4 hours each day from SGV to Beverly Hills. Each time the vehicle was taken in, it was driven no more than 10 miles each time as a test to determine "problem fixed" when I specifically stated the problem only persists when the vehicle has been operating for long period of time.
I proceed to take it to Chevy where they ran a diagnostic & it came back clean as expected since Firestone said the same thing, thankfully at no charge shout out to Kyle. I shared all of the previous information of my problem and knowledge prior to submitting the vehicle. I was recommended to get a new battery because mine was "not good" but they could not provide record explaining how/why because the tech just recommended it, $450 okay , scheduled next visit & done. Problem still occurred within the same day of picking up the vehicle after battery replacement. Returned vehicle & was told their was a Software Calibration Update, $160 just for diagnostic fee Okay, done. Problem still occurred within same day of picking up the vehicle, returned next day & had a tech jump in the car with me to experience the problem first hand since it just happened to me down the road. The problem occurred & the tech understood the issue, possibly. This time they provided a loaner for up to a week or so, thankfully shout out to Berge. I was eventually told they found the problem and it was a concluded loose ground wire G401 they secured it & whatever else at no charge.
If that was the issue why wasn't it found sooner by the Chevy tech or Firestone?
Why did no codes register throughout each testing?
Why did I have to buy a battery or software calibration update?
or Whom was slacking on their job? It seems it whatever the problem is, is being overlooked multiple times with no conclusion.

Picked up the car 4/11 and the car within 1 hour still had the same problem but this time would not start back up right away which has never happened before. I returned the vehicle and they now have provided me another loaner and waiting for a response.

I understand these may be normal manufacturer repair practices; however, there comes a point where there needs to be an ultimate decision that the vehicle has bad technology as also reported by many other consumers in the marketplace around the nation. I appreciate the hard work & consistent service from the gentleman at Covina Chevy; however, this has been an inconvenient burden from supposedly the most reliable car company.
I proceeded to open a manufacturer buy-back case which hopefully lead to an easier conclusion.

update 6/10/2019

After a moment of time the Eco-Stop Feature seems to have been repaired in my vehicle for now. The apparent problem that they concluded and fixed, thank god for insurance has not happened again. They were even gracious enough to cover my deductible & refund me additionally $140 for the labor done in the past.

Took some time to get there but if you are politely assertive I understand that Oscar the Service Director will take care of you within a reasonable manner. I appreciate the teams effort and consistency on this matter.< /text>

Went to Covina Chevy to buy a Corvette, but David was too much of a condescending crybaby for me to justify giving him the commission, so I bought my car somewhere else (car pictured below). If you want to have a good car buying experience and not deal with condescending attitudes like that of David, Vanessa, and the financing director who acted like he was too busy to even introduce himself to someone buying a $65,000 car, go someplace else.</Text>

After thinking of buying my first car for quiet some time now, I finally decided to do it! My dad recommended we go to Sage Covina, so we did & i'm glad we did. Hector (salesman) was so helpful from the moment we arrived. Showed us a few cars, compared prices, until I finally saw one that really caught my eye. We had a certain price in mind & Charlie (Finance) made everything possible for us to get a great deal. Every one there was so nice & professional.  After a few hours of paper work, I drove home on my new car. I would really recommend Sage Covina Chevrolet, you wont regret it.<//Text>

If I could give zero stars I would, they don't deserve any!
I tried to return/extend a leased car on behalf of my sister who is not in the area. First visit, They told me that I cannot extend the lease of the car. was also told that they do not accept lease return . I went there after a long drive to find out that I had to return to grab my other car key that I forgot to bring. Second visit, went there again and was told that they do not inspect the car. I asked if I was able to return the car in place of my sister they said "yes". Third visit, I came the next week after getting it inspected and they said that I could NOT return it on behalf of my sister, and I asked again if I can extend the lease, they said I can do it through the gm financial.  The sales manager was very unfriendly was not helpful at all. Did not listen to what I say or try to understand my situation. Talked back with a higher tone instead of listening. I called GM financial and found out that I could extend the lease. GM said that the car is grounded already and I can't extend the lease because of that. I still DRIVE the car, but the system says that the car is GROUNDED.  I called the dealer and spoke with the sales manager again and was told that I could not UNGROUND the car. I had to explain with a very high tone and volume for him to listen, and he said that I had to got to the dealer and write him a check before he unground it for me. Then he said he was joking. NOT funny, I told him that they were very inconsistent, and he just shut the phone on me, did not care to listen to what I have to say. Apparently they jut want your money, and does not care to help you at all.<//text></record>

<Name>Paul Austin</Name><Text>Xander, my sales representative,  was great. Kept in contact and was helpful throughout the process and the main reason that I traveled over an hour to visit Covina Chevrolet.  My biggest issue was the fact that I repeatedly stated that I did not want any add-ons, including maintenance, extended warranty, or anything else in the deal.  The GM repeatedly ignored those requests and I had to continue to request the deal not include them.  After all that, and waiting over an hour just to be seen by the financial department, I discovered, yet again, that add-ons were included resulting in the whole contract having to be re-written.  I arrived at the dealership at 4:30pm and didn't leave until 9pm.  I was accompanied by my wife and 3 children, who were forced to stay in the car for nearly two hours waiting for the financial transaction to be completed.  Needless to say, I was disappointed and furious at the deceptive business practices that undermined my confidence in the dealership, and wasted my time.<//Text>< response>

I went here for my first oil change on my Equinox. No one came out to greet me like they do at other locations. The price I paid wasn't bad as it included a tire rotation because it was on special. But their normal prices are awful and very expensive. I had to wait for 2 hours for my oil change even though I had an appointment, they didn't do a car wash, vacuum or anything. When you come to a dealership for something, it should be standard as I've owned other cars in the past and they gave full service and included everything I mentioned. I will just stick with our family mechanic as this dealership is not competitive enough.</text>

< review>
Hit a pothole on 210.  Had blowout.  Called and they told me it was covered under warranty.  Got towed there. They told me it wasn't covered by warranty and would not honor what was told on phone.  Then told me I had to buy same brand tire or when I returned car at end of lease I would have to replace it.  Quoted me $212 for that tire and told me that I would have to wait 3 hours to get it from warehouse.  I called my Chevy dealer in Burbank who told me that was not true either.  Found a good tire dealer, Trojan, around corner who got me same size tire with 50,000 mile warranty for $112.  Drive on flat around corner and Trojan replaced my bad tire in under 15 minutes, have me friendly service and told me the truth.< /review>

<review>My parents went with me to look at cars and Sage Covina Chevrolet was awesome.  My salesperson was great but his boss, Bobby, was incredible.  He told me not to mention him by name but i must.  He was not only helpful, but he listened to what I wanted as well as my parents.  We ended up with the Malibu and when all was said and done, we drove off in the Malibu of my parents dreams.  Thank you Bobby and Magic.  You guys rock.<//review>< Pics>

Jose from finances had already set up a contract for me to take out the car, and it was pretty decent, only to get a call from later that he had founf a better one, so i rushed back to the dealership and signed a new more affordable contract just like that.

I initially spoke praises of Sage Chevrolet service but in light of recent events the review I posted must change.

On January 19 I dropped off the vehicle to have the last free oil change performed as well as a recall service for an AC component. The vehicle was supposed to be completed the next day. After not hearing from the dealership I called them around 2pm to check on the status of the vehicle. At that time they told me they found the threads for the drain plug, on the oil pan to be stripped. They found this when removing the plug. This is awefully suspicious as that problem shouldn't be happening on a new truck. Also, it sounds like someone stripped the threads on the last oil change (don't by them) and didn't raise any flags or take action. I was told that I would be put on a loaner car list but wouldn't know for a few days when I would get one. Furthermore no ETA was available on the replacement oil pan. A few days past and I finally got notified that I would be given a loaner car (Monday the 23). All of this is great except the fact I got a Chevy Cruz and really needed a truck (like the truck I turned in for service). A total of three weeks past before I took back possessions of my vehicle. When I got the vehicle back I found a creak/click on the steering when returning it to center from a left turn. I just called the dealer as the clicking noise hasn't gone away to bring the truck in for service. They said they don't have the time to diagnose the problem and wouldn't for 5-7 days.

I'm taking my business elsewhere and I feel you should too.</text>

Know everything about the car and deal you want before heading in here. If you don't, they will take you for every dime you have with no hesitation. Their first offer on a 22k car was $700 a month over 72 mo. They told me it was a great deal. As someone who worked in financing I knew how ridiculous the deal was and got up to walk out. They persuaded me to stay and gave me 3 more offers before offering a payment that was even on the edges of acceptability. They told me every time that it was a great deal.

On top of that, they consistently tried to avoid the negotiation on the sticker price that was already ridiculously high. It was a struggle to start that discussion before the financing discussion and it took a long time to get them to start talking.

I entered the dealer at 4:30PM and left at 12:30AM . The negotiation took that long. After having the used car for two days I noticed there were no floor mats, the tires on the front and rear were different manufacturers, and there were spots worked over with touch up paint. When I contacted the sales person he said, "As Is." They did absolutely nothing to show they were interested in the welfare of their costumers. From offering ludicrous financing to no post customer help they were horrible. I received my tags and licenses today and I was elated to take their registration sticker from my windshield.

For anyone looking to purchase a car, look elsewhere. This dealers business practices are far beyond the typical predatory nature of most car dealerships.

*They didn't smog the used vehicle and two months after purchase notified me to drive 40 mi to them from where I work and live so that they could finish the registration process. When I showed up they sent me to a local gas station instead of handling it themselves.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>{'time': 1473193227127, 'text': 'Thank you for alerting us of this issue, James.

Horrible experience at this dealership.  Please go to a different Chevy Dealership as this is not worth your time or headache.  I'd give less stars if I could!

Went there tonight to check out the Volt and Bolt.  The salesman "Enrique" came out and asked if we were there to see anyone specific, I said no, you.  He introduced himself and that was about it.  I told him I was interested in a Volt or Bolt as my car was totaled last week and I needed a car this weekend.

We liked the silver volt, but the white was open so he had us check that out.  Finally I asked can I turn it on to see the features; he said he would get the key but we asked for the key for the car we were interested in.  FInally he came back out with the key and we went on a short test drive.  He was not familiar with the car or the features, even though he said he just bought one recently.  He wasn't able to answer my questions and when I asked him to tell me about the car, he didn't know what to say.  I said tell me why I should buy it!  It was awkward.

Once we got back to the lot I was looking at the sticker for the features and discussed briefly.  I said it didn't blow my socks off so I'm interested in seeing what else was available.

We walked to other cars and were looking when he just walked away from us and went inside.  We watched him walk through the building and then pace inside completely ignoring us.  I opened and sat in a few other cars that I would have been interested in driving and knowing more about but we had no salesperson.  He never said he was walking away, would be back, or asked if we wanted to see anything else.  He just left and never came back.

Finally after standing around dumbfounded for a bit another salesman came out and asked if we needed help (yet he was inside and saw us dealing with Enrique).  We said we didn't know what happened as Enrique just left us out there without any explanation or help.  I again said I just settled my insurance claim and am looking to get into a car right away but since it appears they don't want to sell one we would just take our business elsewhere.

What a horrible experience!  I have bought many cars and have NEVER been treated or felt this way at a dealership.

I will take my business elsewhere and NEVER deal with a SAGE dealership again!<//text>

<Text>Do not trust this dealership.  I recently purchased the Volt and they promised me it qualifies for the state incentive, but when I applied it did not.  They straight up LIIIEEEEED to me in order to sell me the car, and when I found out that it doesn't they REFUSE to help me and just told me to talk to my tax accountant.  The incentive is a REBATE and has nothing to do with taxes, so this shows that the dealership is COMPLETELY CLUELESS and willing to say whatever to sell a car.

This car dealership is horrible. They have poor service and the employees are unprofessional  .I took my car for a simple oil change and it took them 5 hours to change it. Not only did it take them forever to make the simple oil change but they also made me wait for a month ,for some recoil parts and during this time I continuously called them asking about the parts and all they said was that they were waiting in the parts, in the end they never got the parts So I decided to take my car to another dealership and it took this dealer a few hours to replace the recoil parts. I wouldn't recommend this dealer to anyone at all.<//review>

Had a great  experience there.  Nelson walked me through all the trucks and options i was interested in and guided me into the perfect truck.  Then Mike Reed made sure i got a great deal. Then when the Dennis in the finance department took over the deal got even better. Making sure i got all the rebates, extended warranties, and great financing.     When my freind was considering a new truck I took him to Sage Chevy "just to look", the next thing I know is he's rolling out in a new top of the line High Country Silverado!
I don't usually write reviews because very few are worth my time to write. Its was nice to have that kind of customer service so it's well deserved< /Review>

<text>It was the best service and the people that helped us were great and curtious they weren't pushing anything on us as a matter of fact they sold us what we wanted not what they wanted especially Nader Ammar he was a great salesman well mannered and went beyond his needs to make sure we were satisfied he was a true professional if you come talk to him or ask for him once again thank you very much and keep up the good work!!!</text>< user_name>

Very disappointing experience. Dishonest people, unfortunately.
I bought a used car less than a month ago and 10 days ago the transmission started acting weird and I also found out two of motor mounts were broken. So I took the car back to get it fixed based on the 30 days warranty that I was told the car had when I was purchasing the car. When I got there they said that the car was sold 'AS IS'...." What!!!!!??" I said how come you said 30 days warranty.... They kept my car for three days and when I went to pick up the car I found out that they had done nothing. They said they didn't change the mounts cause they thought it was a part that wears out.
I was gonna take my cousin cause he wanted to buy a car but I am not gonna recommend this to anyone.< /Review>

This is the worst dealership i have ever been to. I went with My sister to buy her first car in March she was approved with 250 down and low payment we called in 4 different times to re write contracts. The employees kept loosing our paycheck stubs. Vanessa was rude and condescending. Ray was very rude on the phone and threatening in text messages. So after 4 contracts and approvals we were notified we actually weren't approved 1 week before we thought we would be making our first payment. Now my sister who is a nursing student and works full time will be catching the bus because they ran her credit so much her score dropped 113 points and she can't get a car until we can get her score back up. This is the worst experience ever we were both in tears.< /Text>

< Review>
Horrible.We were quoted prices on the Trax LS & LT. We there, drove the car then went inside. I asked the manager (Mike, I believe), to confirm the prices that we were quoted. I asked 5 different times & got no answer - he kept avoiding the question.  He passed us to the general manager who, after 3 additional requests for a price, refused to provide one.  His response was "Give me more time" but we had been at the dealer nearly 2 hours & I had been trying to get a starting price for at least 30 minutes. I figured they wouldn't honor the prices quoted on the phone & were trying to do damage control. Rather than acknowledging that & either apologizing or trying come up with a solution they kept BS-ing; to what end?  My final statement was "give me a price or we're done" & the manager said "we're done". We left. 3 hours of my life wasted on complete dishonesty.</Review>

To start off I would like to say thank you to Maria Guerrero the Internet service manager and her supervisor Melissa and a big thank you to the finance manager for ahnusty. My wife recently got into a car accident on Thursday the 25th of August and we both agreed since we can't wait for the insurance to cut us our check for the total loss that we go and try to get another car. I called and spoke to Melissa explained our situation and she said come in we will help you out. I get there Maria was patient with us and we got a couple of cars we were interested in and we first fell in love with a Honda we went threw the process and the finance manager came to us and was ahnust and told us it was in a accident and the manager before didn't write that down and he wouldn't feel rt to sell my wife and I are car knowing that we have kids. So he said he has a 2016 chevy malibu that will fit out price range we test drove it and we fell in love with it and with the finance managers deal he got us and Maria being patient and helping us all day we got the deal made.. Thank you so much sage you guys rock<//Text>

Amy Trejos (BDC agent) sounds sweet on the phone but never return my email nor the call she promised, so I called her back and left her my cell phone <again> to ask her to call me back no mater what the deal will be (good or bad).   Waited whole night and checked my email every 30 minutes, nothing.

Decided to get hold of her the next day and asked her about the call she promised from the night before, gave me BS excuses as they don't allow her to dial out after 8pm (this business closes at 10pm) and blame the manager still working on the numbers....  and confirmed my number again with another promise to return my call after 15 minutes.

Anyway, you know how it ends... no calls....    and no trust again ...

By the way, if you do want to visit this place; make sure you talk to one person and one person only Bobby the sales manager.  He is super Cool !!!  and best of luck.....< /Review>

<Date>1458416339605</Date><Review>I have shopped all over for a particular Silverado and when I found Covina Chevrolet it was by chance.  When I showed up, the salesperson, Maria was very nice and easy on the eyes but her boss, Bobby Velto, was the information highway.  1st off, he introduces himself as a lot porter, I know otherwise, we chuckled and he started in asking me 100 questions, ranging from what my needs are to how much I will be towing to how often and everywhere in between.  When it came down to it, he found exactly the truck I needed and wanted.  He even recommended to me that I don't go with the Hi Country that I originally thought I wanted, but to go with the LTZ.  Thank you Bobby, I needed dark interior and the Hi Country only comes with light interior.  Also I didn't need 4x4 like I thought I did.  Maria took me for a nice drive, when we got back, Bobby was waiting with water and the numbers I was looking for.  I drove out in a new LTZ Silverado and will gladly send people to Covina Chevrolet and to see Maria and Bobby.< /Review><resp>{'time': 1459282195217, 'text': 'Thank you for leaving us this great review, Kenny.

<Review>(Translated by Google) I want to share a very pleasant experience that I had today when buying a Chevrolet Camaro in Covina Chevrolet. The gentlemen Luis Ruiz and Richar attended me. The gentleman Luis Ruiz took all the time it took to help me with the purchase he wanted, he gave me all the necessary information in a clear and concrete way, his attitude was great and he behaved like a professional salesman of cars. Thank you very much Covina Chevrolet, thank you very much Luis Ruiz, and thank you very much Richard, a pleasure to have done business with you, you won a customer.
