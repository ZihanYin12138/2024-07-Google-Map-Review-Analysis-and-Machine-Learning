My favorite of the donut chains. Good variety of flavors and helpful staff. Our go to place for donuts but Dunkin D has a better selection of food and coffee.< /text>

Excellent donuts in a professional environment. Well groomed employees make me feel good about purchasing product at this restaurant. Some seating available in lobby area. Wide variety of donuts. All the classics and great hours. I enjoy taking these donuts to corporate events and office staff appreciation day.<//Text>

I love this place.  Always very clean, customer service is friendly and helpful when selecting a variety of donuts and new donuts available.

The only set back is the parking lot is limited due to, "too" many stores in one small location.  Not Krispy Kream's fault, buy the Planning Department of Pinole didn't count enough parking spaces for how many stores on in this center.</Review>

I don't think they make the donuts here. the ones I got didn't taste fresh and was pretty rock hard. The premium donuts that cost $1.49 more (mint with chocolate filling) looked awful with different shapes; they weren't even round! In fact they look like something from the reject pile.

The selection here is not as good as the one in Brentwood or Concord. But the staff here are really nice and friendly..<//review>

<Text>I like KKD's cause they got my favorite donuts. Although sometimes not each visit but it did happen last visit when staff keeps mentioning the savings if I bought two dozens worth. A half dozen is way too much already for me and now the pressure is on???  I politely accepted the savings. I hate myself when I always give in.</Text><user_name>Richie Sarinas</user_name></record></dataset><record>

Pinole too ghetto for Krispy Kreme. This place got rats and failed health codes, that's why it shut down. Employee at other Krispy Kreme said so.< /Review>

Marin county because there is not a crispy creme closer to our house. What a disappointment! We left without purchasing anything. This just isn't right. Really bad service that corporate needs to know about. Better look for a new job whoever is working at that store tonight.

(Hershey's Gold, 4x Chocolate Iced Glazed, Apple Fritter, 5x Original Glazed, Glazed Raspberry Filled, Glazed Blueberry Cake, Strawberry Iced, Glazed Chocolate Cake, Cinnamon Twist, 2x Chocolate Iced Raspberry Filled, 3x Powdered Strawberry Filled, Chocolate Cruller, Powdered Blue Berry Filled and Cinnamon Bun) I was going to binge before driving 10 miles to this location. I arrived sometime around 9:40 pm( they close at 11pm) and THEY RAN OUT OF ALMOST EVERYTHING. I was able to get 1 glazed chocolate cake doughnut, the last apple fritter, and a blueberry cake doughnut. I will eventually revisit and hopefully get to try all the doughnuts off my binge list but until then here are my ratings for the doughnuts I did try.

-Blue Berry [4/10] - very artificial tasting and just meh
-Apple Fritter [6/10] - Great fluffy texture with real apple chunks but it was bitter...
-Glazed Chocolate Cake [6/10] - Thick and cakey. Very chocolatey and sweet. It was decent/acceptable.

Quite the disappointing experience overall. How do you run out of your signature flagship product....the original glaze??!?!?!??!?< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<text>Today was free doughnut day and it was a great experience. The employees were very nice and the store itself was also pleasurable to behold. Nothing about this place reminded me of the grimy local doughnut businesses I've come to love.

<UserId.>108370512354852135277<//UserId.><text>~MY YOGA JOURNEY with BRIGHT HEART. What once seemed out of reach is now achievable ~

Mount Whitney is the tallest mountain in the contiguous United States and the Sierra Nevada, with an elevation of 14,508 feet.

The first time I heard about it was ten years ago. That was long before my yoga practice or any kind of physical exercise. I always loved being outdoors, but back then, any local hike was a bit of a struggle for me. So climbing Mt Whitney was definitely something *OUT OF REACH*.

About three years ago and one year into my yoga practice, I started seriously thinking about Mt Whitney. It was really Bright Heart that made it *POSSIBLE* for me - countless chairs, warriors, chaturanga’s made me stronger, and I began to believe that, with proper training (and equipment, of course), I could hike and *maybe* summit Mt Whitney.

So here I am  - standing on top of the mountain, proud that I did it, humbled and grateful that Mt Whitney allowed me to do it, and utterly thankful to Bright Heart and its community for making it possible! ☺️<//text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO5rOMe821MRVwyDAhzq_AqcmGvCPbob44r1qc4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM8lJgW-wRIyMiohj0cVEKpzyZ_lx4i_jUoiOqD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN5wu87aj3M42b0Jwbi89YA5hcYZeacxtdLLHdo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< Name>

<Text>I can't recall exactly when I discovered that there was a Baptiste Affiliate studio in San Jose. I'd been traveling to San Jose for years, did a few searches for yoga studios, tried a few out, didn't get what I was looking for.... Then one day, I looked again for "Baptiste Yoga San Jose" and "Bright Heart Yoga Studio" came up in my search! BOOM. I'm there ASAP.

I've had rideshares pick me up from customer sites, drop me off at Bright Heart with my suitcase in tow - they're THAT GOOD.

Every single teacher at this studio is amazing. Community. LOVE.< /Text>< Pictures>

Bright Heart is incredible! The teachers are so sweet and welcoming and create for a great vibe in the studio. I love that the studio doesn’t have mirrors nor music so you have the chance to look and listen within yourself. And really feel what the poses feel like instead of see what they look like. Highly recommend these classes !< /text>

The instructors are friendly and guide the student through the session and ensure that you challenge yourself by the end of the session. The name of the studio is pretty much what you're offered - a "bright" heart by the end of the class feeling relaxed and rejuvenated. I look forward to stay consistent with the practice and continue learning.</Text>< Pics>

The instructors were all so good and encouraging. They handle classes in a fun, easy going, sincere and focused way. Though there are three types of classes the studio offers, I personally fit in and enjoy Power Basics class, as I am in my first delivery postpartum. As a new mom, who’s desperately in need of some “me time” to get relaxed, stress free and connect with mind and body; this yoga studio focuses on those and I feel I am energized, building strength, courage and fitness. Highly recommended!! :)<//review>< Date>

I love going to Bright Heart Yoga studio. I really like coming to this studio as its much cleaner and doesn't smell like other hot yoga studios. I have taken 5 classes so far and  love every single class and yoga sequence. I feel so energetic after getting done with my class. I feel like I am building lot more strength in just few classes. I looks forward to my yoga classes :)</review>

I love going to bright heart yoga because the instructors are very friendly! You can also easily modify the practice to your skill level so it's perfect for beginners and advanced yogis. I always look forward to the lavender scented towelettes at the end of the class!<//review>

Great Yoga studio!! The instructors are knowledgeable and willing to answer any questions after class. They have plenty of classes of all levels on the schedule. Room is heated, so you can achieve greater flexibility. Cons: there are no showers.< /review>

<text>I took my first class here about 2-3 years ago, and I still get so excited to come back and take class when I'm home. The teachers are always so nice and want to make sure all the students feel comfortable and welcomed. I like that the room is warm enough to loosen up muscles but isn't too hot where it feels like it's suffocating you. I always leave class feeling so good especially after savasana with the lavendar towelette :)<//text>< Date>

< review>
I was looking for yoga in Cupertino and didn't try anything else after going to Bright Heart. It's a welcoming and (literally) warm place. I was afraid of the heated aspect of the classes, but it's not too much and I've learned to love it. The classes follow the same general flow, but the teachers add in their own touches. The one thing they have in common is they all kick your butt, incorporating strength and pilates exercises more so than most yoga classes. They have a lot of classes on the schedule so it's easy to find one that works for you if you buy a pass.< /review>

<Pics>None<//Pics><text>I’ve taken several classes now at Bright Heart and I love it! The yoga style is power yoga in a heated room, so it’s intense but the most amazing experience ever. I step out of class feeling like I’ve accomplished something for the day.

I’ve taken the normal power yoga class, which is a workout. I’ve also taken the power basics class, which moves at a slower pace and is a bit more free form. I also took a special Dia de Los muertos themed slow flow class, which was AWESOME.

I highly recommend this place. Took my yoga-newbie boyfriend here and he loves it too!< /text><user>101295696335087560093</user>< date>

I started coming to this studio after I found a Groupon deal. Its a very small place but the instructions are great. It's a laid back environment and a "do what feels good" mentality. I do wish there was a variety of styles taught other than Vinyasa but maybe that will come with time. I've already recommended this place to a few coworkers and plan to continue even after my Groupon deal ends.< /Review>

She goes through the flow more slowly, and she breaks down each move. For example, today she spent a few minutes showing us the correct steps of chaturanga and corrected our arm positioning. She actually cares about my technique! Even though the flow is slower, it is still a challenging workout, and I break out a sweat. The facility is always clean, and I love the lavendar-scented cold towels at the end of class. I think once I feel more comfortable, I will start attending the regular classes.< /text>< pics>

<text>Today at DD's department store Stockton, I purchased items, the woman jogging jacket had a stain on front by zipper. I asked for a discount, not knowing it was mold until, until I got home a hour later. I took all item out of the bag. Tried on jogging jacket and smelled mold. I took it off< /text><username>Yvette Harris< /username>< Time>

The selection wasn't top notch, but I still found a couple of good deals! At the register, the clerk told me my items were non-returnable and if this is their policy I won't be back. Shop for bargains at your own risk!< /Text>

This store is the worst. They wanted to take our empty plastic bags. This is the first store that has every done this to us. The law says that if you don't bring your own bag they will sell you them. I think they just wanted to make a dime. It might have been a Race thing as all the employees were African Americans and we were caucasian. The only caucasians in the store.  I asked to see the manager and was told that Maria was right there but she just walked away from us shaking her hands as though to dry her nail polish.
Aging if you're white beware.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) Their prices fascinate me the quality of the clothes.
What you find and it's unique, you can't find it in another store. The cleanliness is what I liked the most and the people are very friendly.

Amazing customer service the employee was so friendly. The store is very big inside so easy to social distance while you place your order. Lots of items on the menu at good prices.< /text>

I love this place, all their snacks are really delicious. Every single time I come I try something new off their menu. They have a wide selection of things. From Delicious Natural Fruit Shaved Ice to their yummy Aguas Frescas, and their fresh fruit cocktails. Today, I ordered 6 different types of Refreshing Aguas Frescas. These are literally the BEST AGUAS FRESCAS I have ever tried. I also, ordered some mouthwatering tostilocos, because they are my families favorite. I also bought some delicious Paletas, to take to my family. The Paletas were also really Good.  Overall, the Fruit is always fresh and the Aguas Frescas and raspados are incomparable. Besides, the snacks, their customer service is Excellent. They are always, knowledgable and recommend me new fantastic things. The prices are perfect for the quantity and quality of the products.< /Review>

<review>Different hours every day, they keep writing on a paper new hours and tapping it on the door, not sure what are actual hours are so I don’t think I’ll bother coming here again to find it closed. Waste of time.</review>< pics>

I really love this place, I personally always get the aguas frescas, because of how fresh and natural it is, and how refreshing it is, and there are no strings attached, it's all very healthy and natural! Love this place, and really believe it is somewhat of a hidden gem!< /Review>

I've always liked the products they provide. The fresh new flavor from their proprietary sauce brings  everything to new life to what I grew up with.< /Text>

Always get fresas con crema and they’re always so fresh and tasty.
And there’s always new aguas frescas to try and the ones I’ve gotten have been great!<//Text>

Yummy...Their tostilocos are AMAZING! I recommend you all to go get yourself one of their Aguas Frescas, there honestly delicious and refreshing. My kids love their gaspacho mixto. We will definitely be at Cunchys Fruit often.</Text>

<text>I ordered a crepe from this cafe, my concern was that it was undercooked,  still taste the dough. They redid my order and the second time, I felt like I was eating a tortilla. Their new horchata latte was okay, too strong of a coffee combination for my taste.< /text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Great place to grab a coffee with a friend. Love the atmosphere in this place! My only wish is that they stayed open later. Would like to be able to come here after having dinner downtown but they always seems to close just a little to early! Overall great place, highly recommend, and encourage people to support local coffee shops over Starbucks.< /Text>

Attention was good, the fruit tea awesome. The caramel crepe was with a few fruit and caramel, I prefer fresh and more fruit than a few amount of it. Coffee was a little warm. But the best thing I found was the attendant-cashier-crepe cooker- coffee barista. The manager was laughing too much so loud, and it is not nice for that nice environment. Thanks!< /Text>

Breakfast crepe was good. Mocha and cappuccino was very good. Mocha was more authentic than most around Turlock as it wasn't just real sweet and loaded with chocolate. The little guy in pic was hanging with his owner at the outside seating at Cafe Rome< /text>

Fair prices, good strong coffee, and locally owned. They also have crepes aside from coffees and teas. Customer service is also great as well as the relaxed atmosphere. Both indoor and outdoor seating. Dogs welcome on the patio.</review>

< Review>
Coming from the PNW where coffee addicts are made, I was surprised to have had such great tasting coffee at this local cafe.  While packing for a vacation to visit family, finding coffee stands was on my checklist next to toothbrush and snacks.  It's a necessity for me.  As part-owner for a local business in Washington, supporting local shops are important.  Google suggested Cafe Rome and, like a tourist, I had my phone lead the way. The barista was great and for a decent price I had one of the most satisfying iced coffees.  I enjoyed the drink and the atmosphere.  The next morning I waited patiently for the shop to open, Folgers just wasn't cuttin' it.  I ordered what I typically get at my hometown coffee stand and again was pleased with my drink.  I wanted to order a bag of grounds to brew a pot when I got home and share with my other half.  There wasn't one available, but the barista was really sweet and had given a small bag of locally roasted coffee beans for me to have.  I am very happy with the service and will stop in on my next visit to California. #localcoffeshop #coffeeaddiciton #coffeconnoisseur #shoplocal<//Review>

cafe rome has the best service everrrr! i ordered a crepe and a smoothie and this young guy gave me a bunch of discounts so i could afford it and then my smoothie was kinda gross, but i didn’t say anything bc they were already rly nice. But the guy came over and replaced it without me even asking like my heart is so happy omg. anyway and he put a table together for me and my friends. my experience here was rly good and the crepe and my replaced smoothie was amazing. highly recommend< /Text>

<Review>Good for small coffee dates. Quick small bite. Would recommned and go again.

Pro: Lovely atmosphere. Good food. Good customer service.

Con: if Any, recommend Hollandaise sauce for the Breafast crepe.

Time 9am on a Saturday. Not busy. Service was fast. And vibe was awesome.
It’s a quite place. Inside has that vintage feel. Structure is thrown with resembling as if you’re in Rome. Reminded me of the streets of Paris to be honest. I ordered the Breafast Crepe. It’s made with a flour tortilla not the thin omelet and a hot white mocha. Both were delicious. The hot mocha was sweeter than I am used to. But darn good. They also have fruit crepe. Bagels. Fruit. Like a fancier Starbucks.< /Review>< Pictures>

<rating>2<//rating><Text>A friend and I went in here not long after it opened and wanted to see what all the hype was about. I tried the special, which was a savory sun dried tomato, basil, and mozzarella crepe. I literally watched the girl slap on some store bought, jarred sun dried tomato paste, then throw in a handful of pre-shredded (cold) mozzarella cheese, fold the crepe up and slap some more tomato stuff on top (how much sun dried tomato paste does one crepe need, really?) and garnish with a few basil leaves and call it good. Just watching her make the crepe made my stomach drop.To me it seemed like they could have tried better, maybe even melted the cheese? We couldn't even stomach the whole thing and threw half of it out. If you're going to have a shop that falls into these types of specialty niches, you need to deliver a really great product. I was disappointed and will not be returning.<//Text>< Pics>

The guy that was there was not friendly at all and took forever to make my crepe only for it to be under cooked and it was overpriced. Will not be going there again.<//review>

<Review>Gorgeous interior, great atmosphere for studying! Oh and the crêpes are the best in town! Right now they have a limited food menu but they're developing a savory crêpe menu and a panini menu :P I plan on making my friends regulars! 5/5 recommend!<//Review>< Pictures>

Nice large pool hall with lot's of tables. It is open until 2am and is very affordable. We paid $30 for one table for 3hrs with chips and drinks included.</text>

<Review>It's good for teenage and amateurs people to play billiards. No smoke in the room. But for someone who one to play professional billiard, this is not a good place. All the pool table here,  carom or 8 ball are smaller than normal. They are usually not clean the table after someone use. The balls are not clean also, all balls look dirty.< /Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOVIxOpXMAxn2oaIAIigMu8QG9zan-vFOf16lEb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< response>

PROS: Very nice place. Lots of room move around in.  Plenty of tables to play on. Services are great. Nice old men. Bright lights not dim and dark. PLENTY of parking. Not crowded at all. Open late ~2am. and 6$ per table = cheap. Allows outside drinks. Not sure about food tho. but definitely NO SMOKING: My friends and I had no trouble playing here. Noise level are decent. Would gladly come back and play here in the future.
cons: Air conditioner are fans.<//review>

There are a lot of people in Vietnam nowadays.

Overall it was a decent experience. Ordered orange chicken, Shanghai salad, pot stickers double pan fried noodles with chicken veggies, and fried rice. I wasn't impressed with the orange chicken or fried rice but the pan fried noodles and chicken with vegetables on top was actually very flavorful, favorite thing I ate. Potstickers were also a favorite not greasy either. Some items we ordered were worth it, some weren't. As a first time customer I would go back again and order differently. Not unsatisfied definitely worth a try.<//Text>

The food is great. And the atmosphere on the outdoor patio is very peaceful. But what makes this truly excellent is the top-notch service.</Text>

We have been going  go there at least 5 of years. The service is excellent and the atmosphere is relaxing. The food is delicious and haven’t had a complaint from us nor the company that we invite to go there.</review>

The food is good, the service is better than good.  Tonight I had the fried shrimp(looked and tasted like Costco) combination with brown rice(very good), comes with pan fried noodles(only a portion was edible),egg drop soup(hot and tasty)shrimp and egg roll appetizer (same shrimp as above, mushy center on egg roll)and salad(like the dressing,  chicken tastes a little old).<//Review>

The food is fresh, full of flavor and MSG free! The restaurant is very clean and cozy. The service is very friendly. We went in when they were closing and they stayed longer to make us or dinner. Great people, great food, great service.< /Text>

<review>The pizza is good and the people are really friendly. Sometimes they're so relaxed tho that the food can take a bit to get to the customer. The decor is great and the environment normally pretty chill.</review>< Gmap_id>

<review>Great pizza. But what I loved most was the awesome food and beer at an insanely cheap price. Its kinda hard to find a place with good prices. A lot of restaurants overprice all their items and then give you small servings. This pizzeria gives you tons of food for a great price. The  waiters are hella nice all the time, and don't forget to pour me some more beer even when they're super busy. Me and my friends eat there all the time because the buffet is awesome; you get a two topping huge pizza and when you're done with that pizza YOU GET ANOTHER PIZZA FOR FREE and so on and so forth. We've never gone past 4 pizza because they're so big. Plus it comes with breadsticks, salad, and drinks (free refills) all for $8 which is f*****g awesome because I love a huge awesome meal after a long day at a hella low price. Everyone should definitely check it out.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

The Woodbridge pizzería is the best pizza shop in Lodi by far. I had my family of 8 there to eat, we go regularly. We had an extra large pizza and it was amazing. The customer service is great; very family oriented. The pizzería is a family business which makes it even better. We had the pig special and it was delicious. We got an extra large pizza, half for us, half for my kids, with a breadstick, and huge salad and a pitcher of soda ALL FOR $35!!!! Which is great because a delicious cheap family meal, all that food at such a low price, is amazing and works perfect with my budget. Definitely going again and I highly suggest people check it out.<//text>

Saturday afternoon and only one employee working. Poor thing took orders, cooked the pizzas, cleared the tables, etc. She was overworked and got the order wrong, but it was good anyway. Out of wine... on a Saturday afternoon?< /text>

<text>The vegan stuffed spinach and mushroom pizza is one of my all time favorite pizzas. Even writing this review makes me want to go get another one. This pizza is omnivore tested and approved too. I usually share with my roommate and a large is good for 4 filling servings. Leftovers are great. I like to get it half baked and finish baking at home or fully baked and take it for a picnic.</text>< Pics>

<Text>Hands down THE BEST PIZZA IN THE BAY!! how have I not checked out this place is beyond me.
Perfectly done crust ( stick with traditional and not whole wheat and let the butter work it's magic!), Loaded toppings and taste was divine.
They only have take out right now but that probably helped us get our order faster!
We also got a regular pizza and Mediterranean is amazing. Definitely make the drive and check it out<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x808f87d26fa615a3:0x9c2f6aa2356a78d5</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>Easy suggestion to give anyone. Good and a little unusual compared to generic pizza so it's familiar but also refreshing. At the moment it isn't too crowded and the music is nice and not in your face.

I'm from out of this area but I'd come by again!

P.S. my car was broken into here. Can't stress enough how important it is to hide or take anything that might be tempting to steal.<//text>< Pics>

<Review>We love Zachary’s! Their stuffed chorizo pie was the perfect choice for our weeknight take-out: it has a delicious, crunchy, crust; herby diced tomato sauce; and chorizo that’s just the right amount of spicy.

It took about 25 minutes for our pizza to be made - just the right amount of time to take a little walk around the nearby Mormon Rose Garden. Once home, we ate the pizza in our backyard with a glass of red wine: heaven.< /Review><Date>1598738366931</Date><Response>None< /Response><user>109178800225565358130<//user></record></dataset><record>

< review>
There's only a few pizza places I will actually get pizza from in the Bay area. Zachary's hands down is one of them. This is the first time I've eaten at this location usually I go to the one on College Ave. I went to their website and pre-ordered the pizza online. They use the toast app which I'm sure they don't get the full amount but it was just easier for me to do it this way. I really don't like using third-party apps because they get into the business's profit and it hurts them a lot more during the pandemic. But at least do this app you can also leave a tip with the employees. part of the office away from each other. it's really hard for me to choose just one pizza but we went with a carne pizza. We've done parties at work where I'll order three or four different types of pizza for 20 people. And two slices will definitely fill up a person with an average stomach. If you're a big eater you probably get three slices in because the slices are so thick and full of goodness.<//review>

<Text>This is where I was introduced to the amazing cuisine of Chicago Style Pizza many, many years ago. It would be a incredible accomplishment when talking to someone on the phone to take our order...mainly on the weekends, why? They are so busy!!! They also have excellent  pizza.

Thanks Zachary's, Yes, PLEASE stay in business. I have had "other" Chicago Style Pizza's, Zachary's remains the BEST!!!<//Text>< date>

<Review>Zach's deep dish Chicago Pizza is the best in the area. Crisp, flaky crust holds up the hefty pizza, and the chunky, spicy tomato sauce is superb. How you dress up the rest of the pizza with toppings is up to you!<//Review>< Pics>

As always great deep dish pizzas and great new location. Zachary is famous for their deep dish, but we like the thin crust too. They are crunchy to perfection and easier on your digestive system. The pizza are way better when eaten on location.<//Text>

Awesome service. Fabulous pizza options.
Handicap accessible. Big seating area. Restrooms.
The yucky part is the horrible activist neighbors. But I suspect the neighbors won’t last long when the handouts stop coming😂

Keep up the great work Zacharys!!< /Review>

You know how it is always when you do Zachary’s Chicago pizzas and an employee owned company you’re always good provided the best quality service and flavor you know they were establish a 1983 and since then they’ve been going hard I am glad they open this grand location and is highly recommended make sure you get a Pellegrino water order a glass of wine while you’re at it<//review>

Of course the pizza is still great!  The new location is very convenient for me. So far, it hasn't gotten as crazy busy as the Oakland - Rockridge location.< /text>

I grew up in Chicago. I've had all the hometown dish pizzas - Gino's East, Giordano's, Lou Malnati's, Piquads, Art of Pizza. Hands down, Zacharys makes the best Chicago style deep dish out of them all!< /Review>

Beautiful space and I’m sure I would’ve enjoyed the pizza, but left after waiting for 15 minutes without being seen by a server at an off-peak time. That’s not OK.</text>

We recently purchased a used E Class from Suzanna at Santa Rosa Mercedes Benz and it was an absolutely fantastic experience.

Even though the car was one of the least expensive ones on the lot, we were treated like valued customers buying the most expensive AMG model. The entire process from test drive to purchase was smooth and professional.

Suzanna took care of the smallest details for us, like making sure a scratch on the window tinting was fixed at their expense. Further, when you purchase through MBSR, you get loaner vehicles and free car washes. The car we bought was owned by a single owner and purchase from this dealership so we felt like we got a very good deal.

All of our post-sale follow ups have been smooth and responsive. It was a pleasure to work with Suzanna and MBSR. We would highly recommend them.</text>

This is an independent family owned dealership that focuses on the customer. We have purchased 2 cars from them and they perform all of our service. The service department is reason enough to purchase a Mercedes. Prompt, efficient, thorough and safe. They are strictly following Covid Safety Guidelines keeping their customers and staff safe.. We left the dealership today feeling wonderful knowing our vehicles  were serviced properly and were cleaned to perfection after that service.</Review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Had the AEM done on my Sprinter at a different dealer back home in SoCal. On the way up for our trip I got the dreaded 10 start count down do to a def leak. I brought it here hoping that it would be covered my Mercedes, unfortunately it wasn't.  The repair was going to be pretty expensive, and the shop that had completed the modification agreed to repair it, but I had to get it back to them. Nick let me keep the Sprinter there all week, and we got a rental from Enterprise next door.  When I picked up the van yesterday, they had reset the computer for the count down so we could get home.  When I went to pick it up, they didn't charge me a dime, not even to troubleshoot, which is unheard of these days.  I highly recommend Nick Stauer and his service department for all your needs at Mercedes-Benz of Santa Rosa.< /Review><date>1617475264376< /date><Rate>5</Rate><gmap_id>0x808448283223424f:0xbd40a9615f2e027</gmap_id>< Response>

I had to give it a star but if it would have been up to me it would have been no star.
Parked in there lot, walked around for 30 minutes.  Nobody offered to help us or even acknowledge us so I took my business elsewhere. Oh, and made a great purchase elsewhere.
Thanks for nothing.</review>

< Review>
The best service and such nice guys! The Parts answer service guys are patient and do a great job. Thanks for amazing service. The kids at the rental counter/cashier could use coaching up on old school customer service.  They don't make eye contact, or look you in the face when they go over your receipt. They look down and point and then go back to their conversation.< /Review>

WOW!!!!!!!!! I cant say more about Suzanna Barnette and Mercedes of Santa Rosa. I bought a car sight unseen and they helped me feel comfortable and made the purchase effortless. Suzanna Barnette even helped with shipping. This is the only Mercedes dealer I will use from this point forward. Thanks a million Suzanna!!!!!<//text>

<rating>1</rating><text>The service dept. is a group of scam artists 100% confirmed.  Not only did they tell me I needed repairs in the range of $2K+ they also kept my high end mercedes sports car over the weekend and drove it.  They put 80 miles on it and claimed it was a "road test".   I immediately went to a trusted local independent shop that informed me I needed 220$ in repairs and that this particular dealer is well known for their indiscretions.  You've been warned.< /text>< pictures>

< Review>
Today I had to get 2 vehicles serviced. Overall, my experience was good.

Both of the service representatives that I worked with were great. I was provided with a loaner to get back and forth to my home.

My only complaint is with the parts my vehicle needed. I paid a lot for the vehicle and had expected longer lasting parts. I'm a bit frustrated about that.

Happy with my repairs. Happy with my service reps.

USB charging stations in the waiting area would be a good thing.< /Review>

It’s been 2 service experiences now and I have not had the traditional quick vacuum or spot clean in the car.  With the high prices they charge for services, you would think they would provide that traditional extra touch.< /text>

The team at Mercedes is superb. From Nick and David in the service department to Suzanna in sales. In April, Suzanna and I met to discuss my lease coming to an end and getting into a new car. She was friendly, knowledgeable and fun to work with. She continued to follow-up with me and we ended up ordering a new car. During the process, she kept me in the loop and when my car arrived, she took photos of it and sent it to me right away since I couldn't make it in that day. When I walked in, she had a big red bow (like you see on TV) and the entire staff welcomed me. They spent a great deal of with me making sure I knew how to work all the features of the car. Suzanna is the best sales representative and I highly recommend seeing her. The team at Mercedes Santa Rosa is one of a kind. Even after the sale was finished, she texted me a week later to see how I was doing and how the car is! Now that's stellar service!<//text>

<Text>The service department here is awesome. My service advisor, Deric, has been nothing but helpful and friendly. My brand new A220 started having an engine issue a month in and one of my Pirelli tires bubbled out within that time. Deric made the entire process go without a hitch, calmed my anxieties about my tire, and went above and beyond to help me out. He sent me a Lyft for when I needed to go to work or home when my car was in service - pretty awesome perk! I also got a sweet ride as a rental when my car needed to be in service for longer than a day. I got a tire replacement within two days - even though nobody had my specific tire in stock on this side of the country. Deric overnighted the tire and got the job done and my car back to me quickly. The service department here definitely adds to my brand affinity.<//Text>< response>

I want to start out by saying I don't write reviews, but our time at the Mercedes Santa Rosa dealership was really great. We were in the market for a Certified Pre-Owned vehicle so we stopped by the dealership to look at the inventory.  We were greeted by Steven Zuckor who patiently supported our "all over the map" investigation of the lot.  Honestly, I never imagined a car buying experience could be this good.  When we landed on the "one" it was, without a doubt, the least amount of haggling I've ever done and walked away happy.  Thank you Mercedes Santa Rosa & Steven, you've made customers for life!<//Text>

Hands down the easiest and best car buying experience I've ever had.  The car had been set aside for me when I arrived and I was able to test drive it right away.  In spite of Rick being a salesman for Mercedes he quickly researched all the questions I had about the car.  Purchase paperwork was quick and easy - Erin secured excellent financing for me with no money down.  My new car was delivered to me free of charge the following morning in San Francisco, and it had a full tank of gas and had been fully detailed.  In spite of the distance to Santa Rosa I will definitely go back to Smothers when it's time for a new car.

<Review>We are long time Mercedes customers, recently moved to Sonoma County. By far, this was the easiest purchase we've experienced.  Suzanna Barnette is a rare jewel.  Her warmth immediately put us at ease; her product knowledge, her immediate follow up and patience guarantees we will be repeat customers. The support team created a hassle free, worry free experience.  My husband and I highly recommend Suzanna and the team at Mercedes Benz or Santa Rosa.</Review>< gmapID>

<text>I always take my MB Sprinter van to Mercedes dealers for maintenance because I have always received excellent service:  top notch parts, knowledgeable mechanics who stand behind their work, and extraordinary customer service.  This has proven to be accurate for 3 out of the last 4 MB dealers I have visited UNTIL I visited MB Santa Rosa.

I arrived on time for my appointment to investigate a steering vibration and Matt checked me in.  He was pleasant enough and we had a quick discussion of the symptoms my van was experiencing.  I retired to the lounge and prepared to wait for an hour or so.  About 4 hours later I finally heard from Matt that the mechanic didn't find any mechanical problems with the steering and that this vibration issue was caused by my overly worn tires.  I was surprised to hear this because (a) my tires were not yet worn down to the wear bar, (b) the vibration didn't feel like a tire issue to me, and (c) it took 4 hours to figure this out?.  But this was a Mercedes mechanic, the best in the business, so I trusted them.  Matt offered to sell me a set of 4 tires but the order wouldn't arrive for four days.  I declined because I was under a deadline to continue my drive south to Mexico and couldn't wait around that long.

My van was driven back around front and I was also disappointed to see that it had not been washed.  The three other dealers I have visited all washed my van without being asked, but apparently this isn't offered at Santa Rosa.  I paid the service charge (I guess being told your tires are slightly worn is considered service) and hit the road.  At least if my van had been washed I would have felt like I got a little something for my money.

I called a few shops along my route but none of them had the tires in stock.  Since Matt told me it was just a tire problem and not a mechanical problem, it didn't seem serious so I decided to drive to Mexico and get new tires on the return trip.

On the drive back north I noticed the vibration worsening so I took my van to Mercedes Benz of Van Nuys.  Within about two minutes of arriving, the Service Consultant and a mechanic pinpointed the cause of my problem.  It was not the tires, it was a loose steering linkage located under the hood.  They explained to me how dangerous it was because I could have lost steering at any moment when the bolt loosened all the way out.   They fixed the problem in about 1 hour, happily washed my van for me at no additional charge, and they said it was fine to keep the same tires.  I paid for the service, and the service consultant suggested I contact MB Santa Rosa and ask them to refund their service charge since they obviously missed the problem; a potentially life-threatening problem.

A few days later I called Matt at Santa Rosa, explained the situation, and he said he would talk to his boss and get back to me the next day.  Two days later I still hadn't heard back from Matt so I left a voicemail.  Another two days later, after no response, I left another voicemail for Matt.  I suppose he was hoping I would just give up and go away.  After 9 days and 4 calls to Matt with no response, I changed tactics and got a hold of Lisa in service who seemed genuinely interested in helping me.

Sure enough, later that day I finally got a call back from Matt and he regretted to inform me that since they actually provided me with a service (suggesting I buy new tires) the service charge would not be refunded.  I protested saying they misdiagnosed the problem; it had nothing to do with the tires, in fact they were still on the van and it was driving perfectly now!  Matt responded that doctors misdiagnose patients all the time but they still get paid, so they would NOT refund me.  I have never experienced such blatantly unethical behavior from any mechanic anywhere, and especially not from a Mercedes dealer.

So, unless you enjoy paying for faulty service that could potentially kill you, and terrible customer service that doesn't return your calls, take your business elsewhere.<//text>< pics>

<gmap_id>0x808448283223424f:0xbd40a9615f2e027</gmap_id><Review>I travel extensively for photography in an Itasca Navion RV, which is built over a Mercedes cab and power train. The beautiful little 3 liter turbo Diesel needs regular service every 10,000 miles, which is about twice a year for me.

Only select Mercedes shops are certified to service Sprinters. San Francisco is closer to me but not fun to navigate in a class C RV, even one as nimble as the Navion. So I choose to drive most of an hour to Mercedes Benz of Santa Rosa.

And I"m very happy doing so. My service writer is available promptly in a spotless, comfortable office with all my service history on the computer. I'm at ease waiting two or three hours in their spacious guest area or one of several work guest cubicles. With WiFi, self-serve esporsso drinks, and fresh cookies, the time goes by quickly, often in conversation with other Mercedes owners.

When I get the call that my vehicle if ready, it's ready! Not almost done or with some service items overlooked. That includes major repairs done under a third party extended warranty. I have always been completely satisfied with the work done by Mercedes Benz of Santa Rosa and will continue to take my vehicle there as long as I own it.

Great people, great service, great place.< /Review><UserId.>104682806994746944362</UserId.></record>

<text>I am from out of town and was in Santa Rosa to visit a friend when my C-Class started having some issues. I brought my car in without an appointment as an emergency and the service team directed me to Deric. Deric was very professional and listened to my concerns and without any time to waste took my car and hooked me up with a loaner later that day. I was kept updated with the repair process and any changes to schedule was reported to me in time. I finally got my car all fixed up and ready to go in less than 36 hours. I strongly recommend this dealership for service. All other staff including the technician and cashiers were also highly professional and kind.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x808448283223424f:0xbd40a9615f2e027</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I know of no other dealership that offers this level of sevice in Santa Rosa and belieces, "it makes no sense to dissatify a customer."

Smothers Mercedes goes above and beyond when it comes to service and customer satisfaction.

Thank you Smothers Mercedes for being in Santa Rosa.<//review>< pics>

< Review>
Had a very smooth and enjoyable car buying experience at Santa Rosa Mercedes last week, want to say thanks to both Suzanna Barnette in sales and Erin Mahre, finance manager!
Not our first new car purchase by far, so we have been around enough to know a great salesperson when we meet her!   Suzanna was pleasant,  no pressure, superbly knowledgeable of all the workings of the CPO E-Class we purchased & even stayed over an hour late to complete the walkthrough, setup and delivery! (And yes.. a just washed, dried and sparkling beautiful diamond silver E-350 with a full tank!)
And Erin in finance was simply wonderful to work with too!  Her years of knowledge and experience shows as she was able to fully explain all the documents  and yet quickly complete her work, even though she too was staying past closing, at the end of a long day!   She made the paperwork experience easy with her happy friendly demeanor and expertise!
I’m guessing  that the wonderful treatment we received last week,  comes from the CEO on down, encouraging their employees to create an environment that has the customer actually feeling good about the car buying experience!  How about that!
This is our first Mercedes purchase and I suspect it won’t be our last.  This was hands down the easiest, most enjoyable, car buying experience we have had in the last 20 years!  Thank you to Santa Rosa Mercedes!< /Review>

Wow, that was a great experience. Suzanna Barnette is truly awesome. We hit it off our first meeting, and by my second visit I made my decision. Who knew leasing a new car could be so much fun? I got a great car with truly agreeable lease terms. The whole process was seamless, and enjoyable. My choice of car was delivered in the showroom because it was raining (thoughtful, right?), and spotlessly perfect in every way. Erin Mahre is a true professional with paperwork. She had me signed, quick and easy. I could't possibly be more pleased. Best of all, I love my new MB. I'm a busy realtor, so I especially appreciate a flawless transaction. Mercedes Benz of Santa Rosa is A1!</review>

Talk about hassle-free service! Had a great car buying experience with Mercedes Benz of Santa Rosa. This was the first Mercedes purchase I or anyone in my family has made. We've only owned Toyota and Lexus vehicles in the past. Suzanna Barnette was the sales consultant who helped me through my car search and graciously answered any questions I had. From the initial ordering date, through the tracking updates, inquiries, and vehicle spec explanations, Suzanna was always available to answer questions or got answers from her associates quickly to make sure I felt comfortable with my purchase and experience. This is what a great car buying experience should be! I love my GLC300 4Matic and look forward to my continued relationship with MB of SR.</review>

Food is always so good there.
The defaulted AC did dominate our experience (I prefer the cold but this was blasting ICE from 2 directions).
Our son and my elderly mother could no longer tolerate it and we had to wrap it all up.
Before that, our waiter was mindful enough to turn off the fan above us but the restaurant manager in charge was too busy to look into what was happening with the AC.
I spoke to the main manager the next day and she acknowledged the AC situation with grace and kindness.
Though our birthday dinner could have been more pleasant, Panini is worth another chance.</text>

<review>Food is okay for the most part, nice atmosphere, but very low on staff. Their family kabob combos are great, big portions and great price. They have opened their outdoor dining area and have limited seating on the inside as well, but wait times are insane. You have to reserve way ahead of time or else you won’t get a table and have to just order takeout. Food usually takes about 45 mins to an hour to get ready. Overall, not bad but hope they can hire more staff & work efficiently to get orders ready and be able to accommodate everyone.< /review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNrn2-ciXBhFhqfaQcx_VOmGl0tCVR-5WzNoIfR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

But the worst thing is, you have to order online order, and the time is at least 50-60 minutes, and some times you can't even order, especially at evening time. So, generally it's a good network with great and healthy food, by they have to do some expansion to make it more available and responsive to consumers.<//Review>< Pics>

The food here was amazing. I had the salmon plate which was delicious. My family also had the filet minion wraps and they loved it. They kept saying how the sauce in the wrap was delicious. I love how you have many options of sides to choose from. It is also very convenient that you can order take out and have it delivered to you.< /Text>

I don’t recommend ordering pickup at this location for lunch. I ordered 40 minutes ahead and got a confirmation that my order will be ready at requested time. When I was there for pickup though, I was told it will take another 15 to 20 minutes. Should have been notified when receiving order confirmation, not that my lunch time being burnt! On top of this, they charge you a mandatory “tip”!<//Review>

Very good food
Decent quantity in kabob box
Two kabobs and thick
Basmati rice was light
Decent reheat-able plastic container with lid

Neutral

Comes with four eighths of pita for dipping
Few chips of green pepper

Con's

Advertised they were "open" with "23 minute delivery." Food arrived one hour later ... 37 minutes late - just kept saying "driver waiting on good." Maybe they got slammed? But I doubt it - I think they turned on their "open sign" too early and weren't prepared for an order on opening. It was one order - but still involved humus, tzazaki, and grilling veggies and making kabobs.

Small tzaziki unless you order a side.

Huge slightly grilled onion. Who eats a whole medium sized onion? Seriously...
Small couple pieces of eighths of a grilled tomato

Rice amount probably not enough for bigger eaters. For me, it was still too much, but it seems about half what other Middle East restaurants serve.

Great for COVID protection - BUT - Extremely annoying delivery bag!!!!
NOT "user friendly" to open - looks like they melt the plastic bag closed. Tear line is NOT an easy rip open. Not seniors or disabled friendly bag. Not reusable for trash.

Plastic container inside has troughs around it and food gets stuck.

Came without plastic ware.

Came without sumac.

Conclusion for me:

Other Middle East restaurants around here are equally good if not better, and more reliable for delivery time. May seem minor, but the bag annoyed me enough likely not reorder here again. Food should be easy to open on delivery.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x80c29c1ea97a353f:0x3789a9490dabba3d</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I ordered food today and I picked it up and took it home. When I opened my food it was charcoal black and not even edible. I called and they said I have to drive back for a refund. I would have to waste so much gas. How does the chef or people packaging my food not see my that the kabobs are charcoal black.</Text>< pictures>

I super love the food, environment and price. It's a family restaurant and the service is good. The wait time is a bit long if you go on a weekend but worth it.<//review>

Rude workers as they only complain and yell at the delivery drivers that are trying to check in for to pickup the orders and ease the COVID-19 pandemic while they can’t even have more than 2 workers that help check-in the customers that are trying to order, that already made online orders as well as the delivery drivers for the delivery services they work for. They can’t even design 2 lines for check in/order or even picking up when there’s lack of innovation and consistency to the time consumed. Very poor performance and disregard to the community that’s dealing with these hard and difficult times.<//review>

< Review>
I've been eating here for awhile. This is a perfect example of a restaurant that due to a strong base of customers they have chosen to discontinue answering the phone. Now everyone has to order online. So, I've decided to go somewhere where they appreciate people. Rafi's beats this place hands down. The service has always been horrible here but we dealt with it cause it was close and the food was good. lately they seem to be worse. The food has been over cooked on more than one occasion. I'll just say that's the beginning of the end when you start showing favoritism only to online customers who've never even been inside your establishment over people who have ate there for years. Well your curse will be my blessing. Another company using covid to block the rush instead of dealing with it. Thanks it was a fairly good run.</Review>

<Text>I ordered a Dark Meat Boneless Chicken with rice, Shirazi Salad, babaganoush and it came with garlic sauce and pita. My order was via google takeout therefore I didn't have to deal with waiting in line. From the looks of it you order at the counter then find a seat. They have outdoor patio seating which looked really nice on a sunny afternoon.<//Text><userid>110641340793133726846<//userid>< Time>

Great option for family takeout, vegan friendly! My family orders from this place since some of us are vegan and others not, we all eat happily. The tofu kabob is SO good, as are the falafels and romaine avocado salad.</review>

Great food and friendly staff. While I'm sad it's not buisiness as usual they are doing a great job shifting to such a heavy focus on take out orders.< /text>

<rating>2</rating><Review>Update! We have been back several times since my last review and were happy with everything but our order last night was very skimpy! We ordered takeout. Maybe that was our mistake! I ordered the Salmon Salad which I’ve always liked. Yet, when I open the container I noticed only a few pieces of salmon! 2.5 ounces to be exact! I had to pull out my kitchen scale to weigh them. This was shocking on a $14.00 almost $15.00. Have they changed owners??</Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN2claR-dfJGvrRrTWqw2pOksNp1Geuyl2tKLHC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM9iN2soZd9u3P7eBFz6mJmHrwx-7JiwKZPr-zA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< response>

I love this place. I love their food. I dont think the problem is the kitchen employees. The last two orders I've placed there was something missing.  Employees presenting orders should be more careful. I call manager Jay to share my feedback. He apologized.

As of 01/22/2021, I have  placed two orders recently and I was pleased with overall experience. My orders were on point. Food was delish. Customer service was excellent. Keep it up 😀</Text>

we ordered family meal with chicken kabobs and with 1 tofu kabob substitute for me. the tofu was placed in the same container as chicken and when i got home i found that it was laying inside the chicken oil and juice. i called them and they wanted me to stop my entire family’s meal, repackage everything, bring it back (25 minute drive), just to replace the one tofu skewer. i didn’t get to eat dinner since i obviously don’t eat meat and didn’t want to interrupt my entire family’s dinner to replace my one kabob. i understand it’s covid times and things are hard but i was told this is their normal policy for family meals. i was disappointed that better customer service was not provided (i.e. refund, voucher, apology, etc.)</text>

<review>Visited on a Sunday morning with a large party of 11. We were seated quickly (not too busy at 11am) and were tended to quickly. The service was excellent and food was good. Prices are not too bad and the portions are worth it. I had Steak and eggs, the steak was in kabob form which I did not expect ( didn't see that mentioned in the menu) but it was tender and delicious. It came with roasted potatoes (could have been cooked more but I did not specify so they were OK) and Organic eggs ( I ordered over easy and they were perfect).  They serve Lavazza coffee which was excellent, I really enjoyed that. My family ordered Kabobs of all kinds, most of which I tried and they were all very good. The only thing I did not care for was the side of bacon I ordered. It looked crispy but was a bit tough and chewy, and just a little bit over seasoned. We ordered 2 pieces of Baklava and a side of Ice cream. The ice cream was good, the Baklava was a bit sweeter than we like, but still very good. Overall great experience, I would give it 4.5 stars if I could, I highly recommend this place.</review>< pictures>

<Text>I would give them zero star, because they don't value time 60% of online orders are late, all of take out/delivery  Kebabs are put out side on a shelf with 2 cleaning fans on top of the Food, which it makes the food cold. And the Kebob taste is gone when it arrives to customer home.</Text>< Pictures>

During a global pandemic, we expect restaurants to uphold the highest standards for COVID-19 Compliance. This is exactly what I did not get during my last visit, and now it has me and my family scrambling for a COVID-19 test.

We ordered the Family Meal for 2. Chicken skewers were good, but the bulgur pilaf rice smelled and tasted off. We contacted PKG and a manager, Connie, requested that we return the food for a replacement. First of all, this got me thinking, in the nine to ten months that we have been in a GLOBAL PANDEMIC, this is the first time I have EVER heard a restaurant request to have the food brought back. The staff does not know where that bag has been, what particles it has on it, and if it is contaminated or not. Second of all, why does PKG desperately want customers to bring spoiled food back during a global pandemic? Is it to check to see if I ate half of the rice? Is it to check to see if I am lying about the quality of the food in an effort to get a free meal? What is Panini Kabob Grill insinuating towards customers by violating a MAJOR COVID-19 COMPLIANCE STANDARD just to check the validity of the customer's complaint?

I came back the next day and asked to speak to a manager, and Jesse (I believe) was quick to assist. Before I handed back the food, I asked if the PKG management staff has been put through COVID-19 Compliance training. He says that they have, but that does not have me convinced. He informed me that they do not reuse or do anything with the food other than throw it away. This, to me, was very strange. While I did see the majority of the staff wearing gloves, it really shocked me that a manager was going to take my potentially contaminated food with bare hands, and take that food back into the premises, putting the entirety of the PKG staff AND CUSTOMERS in jeopardy through potential transmission.

The general manager, Gloria, was quick to dismiss the situation and explain that it was simply a company policy. So, Panini Kabob Grill, is it company policy to do what no restaurant does during this terrifying time and put its staff and clients in jeopardy through relaxed COVID-19 Compliance Standards by taking food back? How do I know that the staff is actually following these "guidelines"? Why bring potentially contaminated food back onto the premises if it is going to be discarded?

I no longer feel safe supporting or recommending Panini Kabob Grill to any of my friends and family, because I worry for their safety during this COVID-19 pandemic. I hope this review will shed light on the irresponsible safety standards that Panini Kabob Grill strongly stands by, and potentially save you and your loved ones from being infected with this deadly virus.< /review>

I celebrated my graduation today in this gorgeous place. Well we passed a delightful evening and the venue was no doubt one of the reasons for that happy celebration. The crew  collaborated in a pleasant way, the food was yummy and my buddies were extremely  cheerful. We shall definitely visit again for more events. thanks very much.</Text>

Balgur was cold I brought it up the young waiter was very polite offered to get me a new portion. It took a long time it was cold too I asked if he could nuke it! Which he did but by that time I had finished most of my meal. In fairness to the waiters they were very busy and running around crazy! So I blame the management for not staffing adequately.<//review>

Definitely one of the top Mediterranean restaurants that you should try in Los Angeles! Beef Kobideh and Chicken Kebab with Biryani Rice is the bomb!!! They say the combos can feed two to three people but if you're famished, just have it for yourself! Hahaha<//text>

I am a huge fan of this restaurant. The food is delicious. We always get the family chicken kebab plate with avocado salad and feta. It's our go to. The food is so good. Every time I come I am never disappointed.< /Review>

We ordered a delivery during the covid 19 stay stay at home via their website. The process was easy and we got the food within about an hour. The hummus trio was great. The beef kabob was delicous< /Text>

Ordered the appetizer sampler for delivery. Was extremely disappointed that their menu says it comes with caprese (even has a picture), but they gave me cucumber and tomato "salad" instead. That being said, I'd eat their edamame hummus from a shoe.</review>

<Text>Great food. In a loud and crowded restaurant.

They come hand in hand... you make good food, a lot of people want to eat it.

Panini Kabob Grill makes great food!

Hummus trio was very good. Although in a blind taste test I don't know if I could tell a huge difference between the three.

Shrimp salad was very tasty. Shrimp were big, cooked to perfection and flavorful. Although only 3 of them. Dressing had a great lemony zing.

Steak kabob was excellent. First, I like that it is cooked as a kabob, but the skewer is removed when plated, allowing the customer to eat without risk of food flying. Meat was cooked correctly and had good flavor. Grilled onions were also on point. The tomatoes and bell peppers were meh. But I am not a big cooked tomato fan.

Lastly, the banana bread pudding was everything I was expecting. Great blend of banana flavor with a sweet bread pudding. Really good.

Waitstaff were pleasant, not memorable, but not bad.

Venue is standard, clean and loud.</Text>< user>

<review>Panini Kabob Grill is amazing for all meals. Their kabob entrees come with rice, veggies & a side salad. Their portions are ginormous & their kabob meats are not dry. For breakfast, I highly recommend the $19.95 breakfast special, which comes with French toast, sausage, bacon, potatoes, and scrambled eggs. It's an amazing platter with so many good choices. Best part? Can easily be split among four people with plenty left. They also have $2.95 brunch mimosas. What a deal!< /review>< gmap_id>

<text>Use to order at least once per week. Last 2 times very disappointed with both the size and the quality. Kabob meat is poorly seasoned and lula is undercooked. It looked like a broken leftover parts. It was definitely undercooked since the meet looked like it was boiled not grilled. I have paid almost $40 for 2 orders and literally trashed them. I piece of ungrilled onion and spoiled tomatoes.
Come on guys.
Very disappointed and unsatisfied.
Will not go back again.</text><Resp>None</Resp>< Date>

What a fantastic find!   Now in the spot at 30th and Los Angels that used to be Bernal Heights Pizzaria, Shish Ke Baba is the home of excellent Turkish food at a reasonable price.  This is way better than Turkish fast food, with the big hunk of pressed meat.  This is a real restaurant, whose dishes' subtle yet perfectly balanced flavors are the signature of a 40 year chef who has passed his recipes and techniques down to his children.<//text>

Came for lunch with 2 of my coworkers. Place was crowded. Took 5-10 minutes to get seated. Parking can be found in the adjacent lot shared with other businesses. Service was good. If you're going to split the bill, you need to tell them ahead of time. You can't use 3 cards to pay; they'll split the check for you instead. Had the lunch special beef kabob, one skewer. It was pretty good. Seating was tight. Place in general is small and tight. Inside was a bit noisy.<//review>

We ordered takeout from here over the years, because everyone enjoys their housemade hummus that pairs well with, presumably, their on site made pita bread. The grilled vegetables that goes with the chicken we order on skewers has, over the years, gotten more scarce but for a party of 8 Mediterranean food, this place is our go to.</text>

Panini is one of my favorites, they have the best chicken pesto wrap. One of the reasons that I frequently go there is because of their all natural Non GMO menu. In addition, the taste is consistent.<//Review>

<Review>This restaurant going crazy... You have to wait in line about 20 minutes no matter if you want to order something or even to pickup online orders... All people including delivery drivers have to pass through 20-min line. 30-40 bags with orders peeled outside and they can't handle it fast.< /Review><user>105163952241737521299<//user>< response>

<review>Great food and a friendly atmosphere.  There is a lot of food given per plate including rice, kebab, and choice if salad.  The salmon kebab is delicious and so is the garlic paste.  There family meal is great and an excellent value for the money, with plenty of food.</review>< Pictures>

I like their family deals online which is only take out. Best deal to feed 2 or 4. Variety of meats for a little more but worth it. The avocado salad and dressing is amazing...< /text>

If you go during rush...you will wait a while. The salmon kabob is so worth it if you like fish. I always take bulgar.....its very very tasty and does not bloat me like rice. Get a hummus trio if you are going with friends to enjoy at the table.</Text>

Love panini kabob. This restaurant is located in a huge shopping center with plenty of parking. We come here at least once a week. This place has too many servers in compare to the size of actual restaurant. That means you will always get the best service here. My favorite server is "Nina". She gets my order right all the time. Also very patient when taking my order and this makes me very happy every time i go to panini kabob. The overall quality of food is great. Always fresh and healthy.<//Review>

Panini Cafe restaurants provide delicious food.

Management, please notify your servers that they are violating the 2019 California regulation that prohibits restaurants from giving patrons straws without a request. My friend and I were given straws even though we hadn’t requested them. The law is a very small step to try and save our planet. Please oblige.</text>

<Text>The ambience is energetic, this place gets packed. There is a good amount of space though between tables. There are families all around. Once you walk in there you will get the sense that this is a family restaurant. The food is healthy and delicious. I had the hummus trio which was tasty especially the regular kind, the pita bread is soft. The lentil soup was really delicious and the Mediterranean salad, bulgur pilaf and chicken kabob. I'm going to be regular from this point on.< /Text>< Pics>

This is the first time we have been this restaurant. We expected they can provide good customer service and good food, cuz this is one of the good name chain store.

Today I want to complain the customer service.

We went there and had a seat at 4:30 pm. We had been waiting over 10 minutes ish , no one came and asked us. We had to ask a service then we can get a drink, even only need a coke. We also need to find a waiter/ waitress to order food. I want to say at the moment the restaurant was not busy. They had more then 10 waitresses were working. No one came to us and ask us what we want to order. We seems got abandoned. The tables after us already had food. They all came later than us and ordered later than us received their food and drinks. They got service right away, yet we still setting right next to them. We kept waiting for our food over 25 minutes. They brought us food after we complained.

I can not believe it happened to us in a good name chain store. Very disappointed. I would never recommended this location to my friends！</text>

I absolutely love, love panini kabob grill! First of all, I love their lunch and dinner options in terms of kabobs, salads, etc. but I've also become a recent fan of their breakfast!

So this time my friends and I split the breakfast combo. It's enough to feed 3-4 people and includes French toast, sausage, bacon, eggs, and potatoes for only $20!

We also tried the open face smoked salmon which is amazingly delicious and I would order this every time I come here for breakfast if I could!

Can't say enough good things about this place. The quality of food is amazing and it really shows in not only the presentation of the food but the taste</text>

Delicious kebabs, healthy food and very reasonably priced. Definitely try their family platter which is one of my faves. The koobideh is ok but the chicken is great and flat iron steak is good. Good quality food. One star off just because sometimes they mess up on deliveries.<//text>

Everything was fantastic! The Kebab was the best ever. The desserts were off-the-charts good. Very busy. Which is a good sign because everybody seemed to be loving it. The brown rice was great, the salad was delicious.< /review>

The have reduced the sizes of rice and salad on their family packages. They should let people know because you can end up with not enough rice and/or salad. Food is still good 👍< /Review>

Food was really good. From the lamb to the flat iron steak to the chicken to the beef koobideh to the salmon and to the shrimp, All dishes were cooked great adn tasted delicious. A must try if you are craving for some kebab. Aside from the great food they have to offer, they have excellent and kind staff.</review>

<Rate>3< /Rate><response>None<//response><Review>I had the romaine avocado salad with chicken and it was good, but not great. The problem is I have been to the original one in Beverly Hills and the quality there is always on point. I know with expansion some quality can suffer and unfortunately the chicken on my salad was so overcooked and dry that it was not enjoyable. The salad was good, just like the original one. The other thing was the pita- it tasted a bit old like they made it yesterday. Although it was warm, it didn't taste fresh like it was made the same day. For those reasons I had to lower the stars, but I hope with a quality check, all those pain points will improve. I'll still go to the original Panini grill in BH.<//Review>< username>

Each trip seems to be getting better. Service was very good. The Hummus Trio appitizer was, as always, great. Our party ordered the Salmon kabobs, Lamb kabobs and I had the Chicken kabobs. The food came out quickly and hot. For dessert we had the Banana Bread Pudding. Hot, gluee, and sweet. Overall, my experience gets better each time I go.< /Text>

I really enjoyed the food but was really hungry. I was able to ignore what we thought was old soup and old dressings. But the hummus and pita was great and I loved my sandwich<//text>

<text>One of our favorite neighborhood eateries. Mediterranean menu has a wide range of delicious options, including excellent vegetarian dishes, and the dining room is cheerful and comfortable, which makes it a nice place to take guests & family. We love all the kabob plates--  salmon, tofu, chicken and beef, all served with delicious grilled vegetables and a wonderful, flavorful bulgher pilaf. The vegetarian lentil soup is truly delicious. Salads are fresh and tasty. Prices are reasonable, portions are generous. The service is usually pretty good.< /text>< date>

Fresh, full sized, delicious salads and multi-layered sandwiches. They don't skimp on the good stuff. Pesto chicken panini and the date salad is a wonderful lunch to split & share. This place is on my "cravings" list!</review>

The steak kabob plate was great! The problem was the waiter Oscar, he was unattentive until I asked for something again and he was sarcastic. He brought it to the table and then waved his arms like "There are you happy?"then upon leaving he told my boyfriend that he was a lucky man! Ewww! Talk about uncomfortable 😝<//Text>

Fantastic deal for their chicken kabob special. Some of their food is very Persian like and delicious. Nice Italian atmosphere. Indoor and outdoor seatings. When weather is nice (not too hot) I prefer the outside as its more quiet than the inside. I come there often. Consistently great tasting dish.<//Text>

We had three orders and in each order something was missing. In one order there was no yogurt and in the other one the salad dressing was missing. The amount of rice was way less than before and it wasn’t cooked properly.</Review>

Favorites are the cauliflower and the pig's face. I hear it takes months to get a reservation here. My boyfriend and I were determined to eat there. We went accross the street and went to a brewery while we waited for this place to open. As it did, we were seated without a reservation. However, the waitress told us we had to leave before the reservation party showed up (one hour later). That was fine for us so we go to taste the cauliflower. I want to make this everyday if I can for dinner. It tastes light, healthy, and delicious. One meal I will not forget is the pig's face. It has an egg on top. Seriously, the combination of the yolk to the pig sets off multiple taste receptors in my mouth going off all at once. Get it, you won't regret it!</review>

The food is delicious but ever since covid I've been trying to do curbside pickup over here and they never bring it to my car I always have to get out of my car so that's why I'm giving three stars I don't know why they offer curbside if you still have to get out of your car stand in line to grab your food. Definitely seems like their short staffed over there.< /Review>

<Text>The waiting time was too long, the service was poor and there was a bug in the salad. When complained to the manager, she responded  “SORRY!”

We are regulars at Aliso Viejo panini and there’s no comparison for the service and the quality of food between these two restaurants.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

<review>So, Panini definitely isn't bad, but I've never been wowed with anything here. Pretty much, it's a safe, healthy, and convenient choice for lunch downtown.

Everything is good, but the chicken skewer's are always a safe bet. Get the avocado salad on the side and rice pilaf (or sub grilled veggies if you feel like being healthy). Oh and don't be a baby and park at the Ralph's.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

So glad to see awesome coffee in Mid-City/South Robertson, an area that's a bit short of options when it comes to coffee. Wish I caught wind of Paganini Cafe when they were in the midst of their Kick starter campaign, but I'm going to do my part to support this small, authentic business by making it my go-to coffee place forever.</review></record></dataset><record>

I will have you judge based on what I will share with you.  These guys used to have chicken kabob and salad for $8.99 then they raised it to $9.99 and a good portion.  This time (and for the last time) I get home after paying $13 plus tax (almost $15) and I ended up cooking at home. They did the same with their family combo for pick up which used to be $29 and now is $40 for the same food; I think once they create customers they raise the price and cut the portion.  Here is my $14 chicken shish kabob which didn't even fill up the plate . Very very cheap and disappointing.</Review>

<text>Great food, especially the family dinner for $29.95, for a dollar more, exchange one chicken kebab (very tender and tasty) for 2 Koobida so you get 4 skewers. For dieting, they will exchange rice for an extra salad (gives you 3 big salads). Feeds more than 4 people. We get it for two and take home enough for a few more meals.</text>< Resp>

They mislead people by offering something and serving something else. They don’t explain clearly about what they are going to serve. Their customer service is horrible. They did the same with their family combo for pick up which used to be $29 and now is $40 for the same food; I think once they create customers they raise the price and cut the portion.

I HAVE SEEN SOMETHING THAT MADE MY SKIN CURL . THIS DID HAPPENED TWICE, LAST TIME WAS LAST FRIDAY AT ABOUT 8:50 PM. I WENT TO THE BATHROOM, NOTICED THE PERSON IN THE NEXT STALL MUST BE AN EMPLOYEE BECAUSE HER APRON WAS SPREAD ON THE FLOOR IN FRONT OF HER ON THE TOILET, AS THIS WAS NOT BAD ENOUGH, I HEARD THE DOOR WITHOUT HER WASHING HER HAND. I SCREAMED YOU SERVE FOOD AND NOT WASHING YOUR HAND. SHE SAID " I AM NOT A SERVER I AM AT THE CASH REGISTER"  .
I WENT TO THE MANAGER AND VOICE MY CONCERN AND SHOWED HIM THE GIRL WHO WAS IN THE BATHROOM. ALL HE DID AND SAID WAS, THEY BE MORE CAREFUL.
THE SAME SITUATION HAPPENED COUPLE MONTHS EARLIER, THAT GIRL SAID SHE WAS GOING TO WASH HER HANDS SOMEWHERE ELSE. THE MANAGER AT THAT WAS A DIFFERENT ONE BUT THE SAME-O- SAME=O . FIRST TIME I ASKED THE MANAGE TO HAVE SOMEONE FROM THE HEAD QUARTER TO CALL ME BUT IF YOU GOT A CALL SO DID I.    .< /review>< Pictures>

I can't comment on most of the menu because I always order a salad or the chicken kabob entree. The meals I have ordered have always been good. What would make them better is to have a side of naan or lavash or a small side of yogurt/cucumber.< /review>

This place is a gem. Truly authentic: not your usual bacon omelette, they'll put artichoke and prosciutto that really tastes like Italian produce. With fresh fruit. They'll ask whether you want your toast multiseed or sourdough. Not your usual bottled orange juice, but freshly squeezed.<//Review>

The times I've been here, the service has not stood out - you gotta come to this place for the food, not the service.  They also don't accept RSVP for large parties (*we were more than 12.)< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< user_id>

Panini Cafe is one of my favorite Restaurants because the food is excellent and the service is great.  We are always greeted with such a warm welcome we feel like the staff has missed us.  Fantastic customer service.</Review>

Went here a while ago for an early dinner. Good food and friendly service. Seemed like like a Greek restaurant than a panini place, though they did have paninis and they were good. Seemed like they were going through a type of shift in management or vision, though that did not detract from the food or the service.<//text>

Day special was plate with Kabab and chicken skew small salad and rice.
All together come to be a very large portion , ate there twice at lunch time and both cases finished only a little more than half.
Meat was tasty, salad ok, and so was the rice.
Price ok though not cheap, the plate with soda came to almost $21.
Have sitting table in and out, tried both and both were ok.
Easy parking.</Text>

<rate>1</rate><review>Let me start of by saying how unprofessional the manager Alex is. He didn't even bother to greet us and sat us by some obnoxious couple that was arguing the entire time throughout our visit. He was aware of the situation but didn't bother to change our seating. Also, it was beyond rude to watch him bring out his personal cell phone while on duty. To top it off, my romaine avocado salad was way too sour. I didn't even bother touching my salad. If I could give this place no rating, I MOST DEFINITELY WOULD!!!<//review>< Pics>

Must be new owners. Portions were smaller sewers were full of onions & no tomatoes or bell peppers lamb overcooked for the 3 - 1/2 inch bits. Person at counter was rude thinking he was the only one who knew what was going on. Shame once was a good  place< /Review>

The food usually good at Panini kabob. This time we got pilaf rice instead of the white rice. The Pilaf rice was not coocked enough. The rice was too hard and chewy. They need to steam it for much longer time before serving it to their customers but the chicken shish kabob was delicious as usual.<//review>

What a waste!  Nice location, good menu, horrible food and horrible service!!
We had to wait for 20 minutes to get water and about 15 minutes to get the bill.  Had to ask 3 times to get extra lemon for ice tea. I ordered Fallafal platter, the Fallafal were cold and hard as rocks!  Literally asked the waiter to get me a hammer to break it.  The waiters reply - that’s how Fallafal are!!  Will never go there again!!< /text>

Mexican music played in a Mediterranean restaurant. Why? Because all employees are spainish. Service is inattentive and laborious.  Food is ok, just ok< /Text>

It's great Meditteranean food with a nice cozy atmosphere and good prices. The place is practically packed all day but the wait usually resides in the 10-15 minute range for me when they tell me 20-30 minutes. I wouldn't recommend the peach iced tea. Parking is fairly easy as most of the plaza is dying besides the food there.< /Text>

<Time>1534883729096< /Time><text>Great mediterranean style restaurant. We have visited a couple of times this year and have received excellent service each time. It is usually quite busy in both afternoon and evenings, we averaged 15 min wait for seating which is fine. The food is delicious and healthier than most places. I tried the chicken kabob with bulgar pilaf and greek salad, serving size is more than enough for one person. Also, the hummus trio is good! Look forward to visiting again in the future.< /text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None</Resp>< username>

Eh, nothing wrong with this place. The portions were actually pretty large, and the chicken on the kabob was cooked very nicely. A tad bit bland for my taste. Initially i was a little put off by the prices, but once i saw the portion sizes, my concerns were put at ease.

This place just didn't thrill me at all. I just wasn't really havin' it from the beginning. Though in their defense, i've had a rough week, so maybe they deserve a second chance some time.<//Text>

Went in Sunday night food was dried up , salad was old and incomplete on top of that when I asked several time to remove bell peppers before cooking because I have ALLERGY To peppers . I got very sick because they lied ( I’m guessing since they where dried up also , they give me old ones and removed the pepper off of my plate ) this is not a joke , I almost died!< /Text>

This location is by far the worst location of Panini Cafe. Terrible food. The dish was dirty.  The kabobs were old and taste horrible. I talked to the manager showing him the dirty dish,  and he just said these are only fingerprints! I love Panini Cafe, but I definitely never recomend this location of them. So disappointing.< /Text>

The quality has gone way down. This used to be my go to for kabobs but the last 3 times I have had the meat completely charred on one side, and the meat is not as tender as I recall it being. Needless to say I gave this place three tries and STRIKe theyre out!!! I will not be coming back to this location in which I used to frequent quite often<//text>

Had the koobideh and chicken kabob family platter (rice, peppers, onions, tomatoes, chicken), delicious, succulent, chunks of chicken, had the Caesar salad and Greek salad, all good. For dessert we had the tiramisu, wish we ordered more of that!< /Review>

I really love this place.  I used to go to the one in westwood village weekly when I worked there.  They have the best lunch specials.  Their kabobs are filling and the salad and rice that comes with it are also really good.  Their salmon is also delicious.  I've never actually had a panini here just the kabob plates but friends have also liked their sandwiches.  For 9.99 it's a great bargain for really good food. (chicken kabob special!)< /Text>

Excellent!  Was just expecting a run-of-the-mill panini place, but there's much more to choose from.  Wide range of Mediterranean food.  Had the koobideh and chicken kabobs, both of which were great.  Very impressed.<//Review>

Delicious food and very reasonable prices.  This particular branch gets a little noisy and crowded, which takes away from the otherwise nice atmosphere.  Located in a big shopping center with plenty of free parking.  Highly recommend the chicken shish kabab.<//Text>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>Great tasting food basically sums up Panini Café. This is one of a number of locations in Southern California, serving a mix of Italian and Mediterranean foods with American fare breakfast meals as well. I had a chance to try the Chicken Pesto grilled sandwich which was a little dry but overall tasted good. What really tasted delicious was their Koobideh kabob entrée; though it isn’t listed as “Highly Recommended” or “A Must”, I’d definitely give it a try. Pricing is more than fair considering the large portion sizes on their Mediterranean entrees. This restaurant is located in a large shopping plaza which has plenty of convenient parking.<//Text>< pictures>

I am changing my review about this place, they were good in beginning but they are getting really bad, like tonight i came to victory location and i got here at 9:05 pm and now is 9:44 and i am still waitting for my food. Also in glendale location, i was having lunch and accidentally there was lots of salt in one side of my food and i got a tribble headache after.</Text>

The food looked good and I tried it out since my company moved to the area... big mistake! Bland overpriced food, slow service, and apparrently overwhelmed by a party of 5. The bread had the faintest grill lines and was by no means a panini.< /Review>

<date>1368040966959<//date><review>This place caught my eye, and the service was as good as any decent service should be. The food however is another story. I ordered a tuna melt which, to my surprise, was the fishiest and most unfamiliar tuna sandwich I've ever had (not enjoyable). I got the servers attention to ask him if I could trade for something different, He had no problem allowing that so I ordered something simple, reliable. A turkey club panini, also no good. Turkey club from here is dry and the avocado was tough.

The worst thing about it was the bread. I was expecting a panini-pressed style sandwich. The bread I got on both sandwiches had blackened grill marks on both sides, of both slices of bread. It's as if they just panini pressed the dry bread to a crisp and then tossed the ingredients between.

They were friendly and the decor was nice and I felt bad because I've never returned food. My girlfriends dish was delicious (chicken kabob). I'm here on behalf of good panini's everywhere saying this place needs to be put in check.  Still tipped the nice waiter< /review>< Rating>

< Review>
The resturant was clean and had an open feel to it. The server who helped us seemed as if they wanted to be somewhere else.

The chicken kabob was nice and tender. The Basmati rice was and fluffy. The sald came out fresh. All the food was plentyfull. We had three kinds of Hummus and all wrlere good.

The Salmon kabob was just ok.

The food overall was good but nothing spectacular that would rate a 5. A fair rating would be 3.7 so I rounded it up. The seasoning is on the light side.

Tplace is good for families and they have out door seating.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) Excellent kebab, I enjoyed it, unfortunately the falafel and chickpeas are not so recommended. Detail, the chickpeas were just a little too watery, the other chickpeas I took were sour with a fermented taste as if it had spoiled and I had not eaten from it. The falafel was dry and not spicy enough for my taste. Overall the meat is good, the chickpeas are fine, the special chickpeas were not fresh.

(Original)
קבב מעולה, נהנתי ממנו, לצערי הפלאפל והחומוס לא כל כך מומלצים. אפרט, החומוס היה בסדר רק קצת מיימי מידי, החומוסים האחרים שלקחתי אחד מהם היה חמוץ עם טעם מותסס כאילו התקלקל ולא אכלתי ממנו. הפלאפל היה יבש ולא מתובל מספיק לטעמי. סך הכל הבשר טוב, החומוס בסדר, החומוסים המיוחדים לא היו טריים.<//text>
