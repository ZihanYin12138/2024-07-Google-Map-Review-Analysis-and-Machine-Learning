< review>
We have been going to this dental office for a while. I have 3 kids and they all love going to the dentist because Dr Harvey is really great with them. Clean office, great service and they won't push unnecessary treatments. Our previous dentist used to find 3 to 5 "cavities" per child each visit and push so many dental procedures. When we switched to Dr Harvey the previous dentist just gave a long treatment plan for my son to fix his "5 cavities". After x-rays Dr Harvey informed me that my son has no cavities. Dr Harvey is a truly great dentist.</review>

My 2 kids have been seeing Dr. Harvey for about 9 years. They have no fear, and actually enjoy going to the dentist. The hygienists are gentle and extremely personable. Very knowledgeable, warm and assuring bedside manner from everyone. Lots of things to keep the little ones comfortable: from video games and toys in the waiting area, the fun murals on the wall, a TV above every chair playing a movie, to other niceties like sunglasses for my child who doesn't like the light shining in his eyes, and a choice of tooth polish flavours like vanilla, bubble gum, berry, etc. Can't recommend highly enough.</Text>< Rating>

<Review>The staff here always take great care of my children. I have 2 kids and it’s never a hassle getting an appointment with them all together. Usually takes no more than an hour at the visit, which is extremely fast and convenient because it does not take up my whole day. Being a single dad it's hard to get the kids to calm down and sit through a visit to the dentist.. What I really appreciate is how they are able to keep my kids entertained and calm through there visit! Such a big help. The staff is amazing! You’ll love them!< /Review>< pics>

Glad we switched to Little Smiles of OC! The staff is great and very good with smaller children. I'm also glad that they are open until 5:30pm at least once a week. As a working parent, I'm unable to just take a couple hours off work just to take my kiddo to the dentist, so I appreciate that they are open past 5pm on Wednesdays.</Text>

Excellent office to bring your little one. I couldn't be happier that my daughter was actually happy after her appointment. It took some convincing to get her inside, but everyone on this team did a great job to keep her smiling the whole time. Thanks so much for a great experience! We will be back.</review>

Dr Harvey was the most amazing Dr.  He took the time to help our daughter with her anxiety.  He stopped the extraction and fillings by rubbing her forehead and count with her until she felt calm and much better.  Thank you for being so awesome for our little ones.  I highly recommend Dr Harvey for all parents with young kids.  Thank you Dr Harvey and Team for being extra amazing.<//Text>

First time at the office and my daughter loved it! She is 3 yrs old and has been to another dentist office before and always had a hard time but her visit to Little Smiles OC was the best! The room they have with the games & movie is awesome for the kids to be in while they wait to be called, my daughter loved it. Then once you get called to the back its just as warming and comfortable. My daughter was so calm and I know the the dentist and assistant helped as well. Dr. Harvey and his assistant were the best! So nice and so good with my daughter. Glad we found this Pedriatric Dentist!!< /text>

Dr. Harvey and his team are fantastic! The entire treatment went smoothly from consultation to finish, and the customer service of the office was impeccable. During our consultation he was super friendly, was extremely forthright and gave me ALL my options and told me I can select the treatment I felt most comfortable with (which a lot of other child dentists did not do- they gave me one option and said that's what I needed to do).
Both my daughters are patients of Little Smiles OC and we have had nothing but a first class experience.<//review>

<review>We have had an amazing experience at Little Smiles OC... my kids were not happy at their previous dentist... and they are pretty wild energetic boys. Everyone in the office had both had my almost 2 yr old and 4 year old happy and smiling throughout their visit. The front desk was very helpful with an insurance question I had, too- even called me to follow up to see how the kids were doing. Very thoughtful.</review><pics>None< /pics>< username>

In fact, they always enjoy the experience because the entire staff at Little Smiles OC  makes them feel comfortable. It doesn't hurt that the environment is so fun and kid-friendly that it doesn't feel like a trip to the dentist as much as a exciting adventure that they can look forward to.

Amazing child dentist. My daughter had her tongue tie corrected by Dr. Harvey and the procedure well flawlessly. I was worried about the after effects and make sure my daughter was completely comfortable throughout the procedure and afterwards. Little Smiles of OC and their staff uses the latest technology and I appreciate how great of a job they did. Thank You!< /review>

Being fairly new to Irvine, I needed to find a new dentist and am really glad I stumbled on this practice. My son has had some jaw issues that make most dental work tricky, uncomfortable and often painful. But everyone I've interacted with at Little Smiles OC has been top notch.

Dr. Harvey was as gentle as possible, all things considered, and really seemed to go out of his way to make sure my son was comfortable -- super grateful for that.  The hygienists and assistants are extremely knowledgeable and friendly, and scheduling was way easier than I've experienced at other places in LA. Highly recommend.</review>

We have been using Dr. Harvey for over a decade and he is always great with the kids and very professional!  For a while we moved out of the country, but would return in Summer and Winter and specifically set up an appointment with him during these times.< /review>

Thanks so much to the staff for being so patient with my son. He can get very anxious when he goes to the dentist.

He was so nervous but to see how they talk to him and help him understand they are there to help him it’s a nice feeling. It really goes along way to helping my son get over his fear of going to the dentist.

I can’t thank Dr. Harvey and everyone at Little Smiles OC enough. He is a wonderful dentist.<//Review>

I’ve been bringing my three children to Little Smiles OC for almost 3 years. The staff is extremely friendly and professional and the office is childlike/colorful and clean. I love it here!!! I’ve recommended them to Family and Friends (:</review>

<review>Great experience for my 3 yrs old, Dr. Harvey cleaned his teeth with a lot patience, he spoke to him and explain to him what he was doing and kept him calm throughout the process. He gave us recommendations and advice for keeping his teeth clean. I am so glad that we found Little Smiles OC. We are definitively going to be coming back here regularly.<//review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Both of my kids had a great experience here! My daughter said that her dental hygienist was super nice and did a very thorough job cleaning her teeth. Dr. Harvey is a very attentive dentist and spends the time explaining any questions that I have for him.<//Text>

< Review>
After extensive research, I chose Dr. Harvey Lee of Little Smiles of OC for my adult tongue-tie surgery. The entire experience starting from the initial phone consult to the procedure itself was excellent. Due to the small amount of information about adult tongue-tie surgeries, I was apprehensive about the procedure. However, I was completely at ease for the entire process. I have been to lots of dentists and have not felt the same superior level of customer service. I wholeheartedly recommend Little Smiles of OC, especially for adult tongue-tie surgery. You will be extremely satisfied with the treatment as well as the results.</Review>

Coming in for something possibly overwhelming with our 6week old baby (consult for lip/tongue tie) the staff were all compassionate, understanding, patience and SUPER helpful. We felt very confident with Dr. Harvey Lee and staff from the moment we met them, which was really just a matter of minutes before unfortunately our son had to undergo both (quick) procedures. We wouldn’t have went through With it if we did not see these amazing qualities listed above. We are very grateful for the Dr and his superb staff. Thank you for keeping us calm and taken care of. So thankful we found your team! Our little guy did well and healed well.</text>

We have been with Dr. Harvey Lee since my  boys were 5 and 3 y/o. They are 16, 14 and now our daughter is 9. We live in Placentia and willing to drive to Irvine to stay with Dr. Lee and his amazing, awesome, & super kind staff! All of the dentists/doctors are also just as wonderful. Never had a negative experience. Your kids will love their new office. My niece and 2 nephews who live in Irvine also go here. You will not be disappointed. The kids can also watch movies playing from the ceiling to make it an even better experience!< /text>

We love Dr. Harvey. But this appointment felt rushed. I was coming from another appointment and unfortunately, was 15 minutes late. My husband brought our kids and they were on time. But somehow, just as I pulled up, they were coming out of their appointment. I was absolutely heartbroken. In 15 minutes, they managed to polish and examine BOTH my children’s teeth. I value efficiency, but felt excluded. I learned not to schedule all our appointments on the same day.<//Text>

Would highly recommended!! We have mostly been a patient of Dr. Maggie’s but have also seen Dr. Harvey who is amazing too!! Both doctors work so well with kids. They take the time to show the kids that they care and want them to have a great experience at the dentist. Their kindness and knowledge really sets them apart from the others. Last visit with Dr. Maggie, she explained things to our daughter in a way that she could understand and made sure she was comfortable the entire visit. Needless to say, our daughter had another great experience.<//Text>

<Text>Drove an hour and a half to have Dr. Lee Harvey perform a tongue and lip tie frenectomy on my daughter. It went very well then, and now a year later, she is still eating better and doing very well. About to have another baby and I will be taking this one in to be evaluated for tongue tie by him too if I suspect it. I wouldn't go anywhere else, he is amazing. The staff was so helpful and kind and if I lived close, he would be my children's dentist, too!</Text><rating>5</rating></record></dataset><record>

We have been going to Little Smiles since my two boys were old enough. We just recently had an apppointment post covid lockdown and we were extremely impressed with the precautions they took. All staff had masks on, there was a partition at the reception desk and all patients were kept distant.  The cleanings and xrays for both my boys went smoothly as usual and we were in and out of there relatively quickly. THank you Little Smiles for providing such solid dental care and highly recommend them to anyone in need of dental services.</Review>

First visit to this office, I was very pleased with the level of service I received here. The staffs were very friendly and helpful.   Dr. Laura is very professional; courteous and pleasant from start to finish.  I felt confident that I was making the best treatment choice.  Here is the bottom line: My 5 year old girl didn’t complaint anything for her first time visit to the dentist office.  She did the cleaning, x-rate and treatment all in the same time.  By the way, the electronic correspondence from registration to confirming appointments is also very helpful. I’m very happy that I choose the right dentist for my girl.</Text>

< Review>
Today was the first dental visit for my son who is 4.  Yes I should have taken him earlier :)  He was initially excited to go.  I especially loved the wonderful artwork in the lobby as well as the toys and books to read. When it was time to go in, he sat in the 'chair' and he got a little nervous/scared.  However, the assistant had a very sweet/calming personality and my son got more comfortable.  I appreciate people who engage in a conversation in order to make a child feel comfortable.

My son didn't wanna lie down on the chair to get his teeth brushed, and so she found an alternative, and he was fine after.

After the X-rays, my son saw Dr. Lee. He was also very calm and had a nice personality.  My son also felt comfortable with him as he was interactive as well.  He explained a lot about what to do to take care of my son's teeth, and what he was looking for on X-rays.  I appreciated that he wasn't in hurry, and explained well.

All in all, it was a great first visit, and I definitely recommend Little Smiles for a nice, friendly staff!<//Review>

<review>My two week old son had to get his lip and tongue ties revised. The entire staff was helpful and friendly. Dr. Lee was very kind and took a lot of time to explain the procedure and made sure I was well informed and comfortable. The revision was quick and he made sure I had a good understanding of the stretches necessary for healing. A great experience for a sensitive procedure.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

Great new location!  Both my kids had appointments at the same time.  They took them right away.  We didn't have to wait at all.  They moved along quickly without the feeling of being rushed.  Everyone was kind and happy.   Thanks!</text>

12/1/16  We saw Dr. Maggie yesterday, and she (as always) took such great care of our kids.  Her expertise and kindness are unparalleled.  We truly feel so blessed to have found such a wonderful dentist!

(2014) Dr. Harvey Lee is exceptional!  Thanks for taking such awesome care of our kids' teeth! :)< /Review>

This dentist has a really great bedside matter. My 2 year old son doesn't warm up to people easily but let her check his mouth without any issues whatsoever. I can tell that Dr. Trinh really cares about her patients. Her staff were friendly, the place was super clean and she really took the time to answer all my questions.</Text>

< Review>
The staff at Little Smiles of OC was great from the front desk to the dental staff.  My 8 year old son went for a tooth extraction and he was a little nervous, but  Dr. Harvey Lee and his team were thorough and great with kids!  The visit was pleasant all around!  I would highly recommend Dr. Harvey Lee to anyone in need of a good dentist for kids!</Review>

They were completely awesome!! Brelyn who is the office manager was amazing in getting us in and her follow up and follow through were amazing!! When we arrived she called us by name immediately. Both the Hygienist and Doctor were super friendly, gentle and caring. After we left my 10 year old son said this is my favorite dentist and the best we have ever gone too. That is everything coming from a child especially when it comes to going to the dentist. Truly they were amazing!! I would highly recommend them!!!! Thank you so much!!</review>

My son has gone to Little Smiles twice now. Both for routine checkups. He's just over 2 now and his last checkup went well. He doesn't like laying back to get his teeth brushed but he did like it when they had him brush a fish's teeth and floss. He saw Dr. Laura. Everyone is very nice (hygienist, receptionists, dentist) and at the end he got to pick out his new toothbrush, a sticker, and a toy. He picked a bookmark which I thought was cute. We'll certainly keep coming back. We've already scheduled his next appointment.</review>

Dr. Harvey and his team are amazing!!! My kids actually get excited when I tell them they are going to the dentist! (they are 3 & 6) He is so good with the kids... and so is his whole team! Plus, from the video games in the front waiting room (although we never get enough time in there, because they actually RUN ON TIME!), to the toys, stickers, new toothbrushes, sugar free lollypops, and love they get.... they can't wait to go back! Dr. Harvey is wonderful... I which I could see him!!!!</Text>

I highly recommend Little Smiles Dentistry.  I first brought my daughter to see Dr. Harvey when she was 1year old.  Dr. Harvey was so gentle and the entire staff was so friendly that my daughter, who is now 3, really looks forward to going every 6 months for her routine "princess teeth" cleaning!  And everyone knows, a happy and relaxed child makes a VERY happy and relaxed parent :)<//review>

Making an appointment was super easy. Saw Dr. Trishia for my son's first dentist appointment (~1 year, 2 teeth) and am very pleased with her care. Dr. Trishia has great bedside manner, is very knowledgeable, and she put both me and my son at ease right away. I will continue to take my son to Smile Wide Dental. The whole staff is friendly and the experience was truly enjoyable. Highly recommend!<//review>

My son was afraid of dentists until I took him to Dr. Harvey. My 4 year old son had a lot of work to be done and Dr. Harvey was very gentle with him. My son brags about his teeth and tells everyone "Dr. Harvey fixed my teeth". He is no longer afraid to visit the dentist office. I'll be taking my little daughter there as well. I highly recommend Dr. Harvey Lee!<//Review>

We love Little Smiles of Orange County!  Dr. Harvey, Dr. Laura and the rest of the staff from the receptionists, DAs and billing department are awesome!  Our LO needed to get some intensive dental work done and they were helpful, courteous and pleasant from start to finish.  Although we were apprehensive and nervous about the work that needed to be done, Dr. Harvey put us at ease with thorough explanations of our choices and we felt confident that we were making the best treatment choice.  The electronic correspondence from registration to confirming appointments is also very helpful. We highly recommend them and are very happy we chose them for our LO's dentist.< /Review>

Amazing! Dr. Harvey Lee performed a tongue tie procedure on my newborn and I couldn’t believe how amazing the entire experience was... not something any new parent wants to do but he and his staff made the whole experience so wonderful and I am grateful we were referred to him by my sister’s midwife Lindsey Meehleis. I was amazed at how fast the recovery was compared to other moms’ experiences with laser and scissors used by other doctors. Dr. Lee uses a Bovie machine and the recovery is much faster and requires less stretching than what my other mom friends had to do with their babies that had the procedure done at other practices. Plus his office is super clean and easy to get to.
Highly recommend!!!</review>

Days after moving back to CA from out of state, my 15 month old fell and chipped his tooth. Since we didn't have a dentist lined up yet, I was anxious while reading reviews on google. However, after reading the reviews for Irvine Pediatric Dentistry, I was at ease. I called, and they allowed me to come in an hour later to get the chipped tooth checked out. The dentist was wonderful, and having gone through the same thing with his 15 month old just months before, he really helped us understand what was going on, and gave us suggestions for the future. I was so happy with our experience, and would definitely recommend them to anyone!</review>

<Text>My daughter had a little hard time laying down when putting the flouride on and flossing but the staff were all friendly about it. She has been two times now and will go back again in 6 months.
The waiting room is pretty awesome, I wish my dentist's office waiting room was as nice.<//Text>< user>

We had a great experience for our first visit. The hygienist did a great job of introducing all of the tools and showed my son what she would be doing to him on the "nemo" fish (a stuffed animal with teeth).  My son was a pretty happy camper - he's under the age of 2, so I didn't push the cleaning too hard.  I wanted him to get into the dentist and get comfortable with the process first.  The staff there was very supportive of that decision and thought it was a good idea.  The dentist still took a look at his mouth to ensure everything looked ok.  My little guy got a little upset when they tried to stick the mirror in his mouth, but they were able to get a peek and let him roam / play in the toy box. Overall, this experience was easier for me than trying to eat out at a sit down restaurant with my little one.<//Review>

<Review>I did want to provide feedback and Little Smiles sent this link by email a few days after the visit.  I had not planned to post a public review but if this is how they prefer to get feedback, then that is ok.

I brought my 2 year old in for her first dentist visit and had mixed feelings.  The reception staff was friendly, the wait time was very short.  Ahead of the visit, my daughter seemed curious about going to the dentist (even sounded a little excited) but clearly had no idea what to expect. The hygienist that called us back and led us to the room was polite but I felt like she wasn't very receptive to the fact that this was my 2 year old's first dentist visit and she was clearly a bit frightened by the dentist's chair, equipment, noises, etc.  She clung to me crying and wouldn't let go.  Rather than try to get to know her and reassure her, she simply asked that we sit down together in the chair and started playing a cartoon on the ceiling, hoping that would distract her.  It didn't.  Then she told me it would be ok if my daughter was crying because at least her mouth would be open for the cleaning - though after only a few minutes of being in the office I did not feel ready to hold down my screaming child, let some stranger stick a bunch of instruments in her mouth, and force her through her first dentist visit.  All of this seemed odd to me since, as pediatric dentists, there must be many toddlers coming to them for their first visit.  I thought they'd have a few "tricks" or at least spend 5 min or so to try and connect with the little ones.  I want to emphasize, the hygienist was not mean or anything at all, she just seemed oblivious to dealing with young children who are nervous about the dentist.  This was disappointing.

After a few minutes of my daughter refusing to even look at her, she finally suggested we meet Dr. Harvey first and talk through dental care and maybe try the cleaning again towards the end of our visit.  Dr. Harvey was easy to talk to and did the cleaning himself.  He was fast and it took under a minute - my toddler was crying, but she seemed to recover quickly and sat in my lap as I talked to Dr. Harvey afterwards about toddler dental hygiene, etc.

My daughter was happy to pick out a sticker and a prize from the toy chest afterwards but overall, it was not what I expected.  I felt only so-so about the visit and since cleanings are done primarily by hygienists, I feel the need to shop around a bit more to see how she gets on another pediatric dentist before I decide on a dentist for her.<//Review><username>Jean K</username><resp>None<//resp>< rating>

I’ve rented many homes in my lifetime and American Horizon was the best experience hands down! Robert made it very easy from the very beginning! and at move out! I wish they had locations nationwide because they handle helping people move a great experience not like most properly management companies do. I would definitely refer this company and Robert to help anyone with their move! 5 stars isn’t enough! I will definitely miss the professionalism of this company.</review>

<Text>Robert and team at American Horizon are amazing! They have provided prompt and professional guidance throughout the process of getting our new rental listed, rented, and now managed. Robert was so patient with us as we had a lot of questions given this is our first rental property. I wouldn’t hesitate for a second to recommend American Horizon to our friends and family for property management services.<//Text>< Pics>

We have been very happy with Stacey and American Horizon. As a former property manager, we have had a hard time finding a property management company to handle our properties as we would. They have been very professional and responsive. We would highly recommend their services.<//Text>

<text>Robert Bussell managed my condo while I was stationed overseas for a year. He found an ideal tenant quickly and there were no issues the entire year and he was very helpful and understanding of the time difference if I ever needed to be contacted. Then he represented me as my selling agent and held on through the process entire close process and dealt with the few hiccups we had. If I ever ever property in the Roseville area I will without question use American Horizon again. Thanks Robert!!< /text>< Pictures>

< review>
We've been with American Horizon for a few years now and I just wanted to write a little review in appreciate for the great service, great communication and quality renters we have received from Nancy Marshall and Stacey Bussell. Before this, we had never rented a home and we were a little anxious going in, but working with American Horizon has been a great experience.  They screen for qualified and caring renters and we could not have done this on our own.  From the very beginning, Nancy and Stacey have had our best interest in mind and, because of that, our home has remained in the same great condition we left it years ago.</review>

My recent move introduced me to American Horizon Prop. Management. I can say that there is very little I enjoy about moving. However, American Horizon has been great so far. I say this having had less than great experiences with other property management companies in the past. I initially met Nancy. She showed us the house at first and has been there through the leasing process. I have also had pleasant interactions with  Heather and other staff at the American Horizon offices.  I have been able to have questions answered quickly and completely via text or email. Any issues or scheduling(lawn maintenance) for instance has been completed as promised by Nancy and staff. I hope to continue this level of service throughout my leasing experience. Thank you American Horizon!< /Text>

We have been clients of American Horizon Property Management for at least a year.  They helped us speedily find great and reliable tenants...a second set of tenants for us, but our first through the company.  At the same time, they saved us a lot of grief when we tried evicting our first tenants!!  Our previous tenants were nightmares!  They helped counsel us on how to evict our first tenants.  I can't say enough good things about this company! They are punctual in responding to and rectifying any and all issues regarding the maintenance of our property. They are very, very  knowledgeable in pricing our rental at a current and fair market rate for the tenants and us. Even though I cannot speak for our tenants, it seems to me they are happy with American Horizon as well as myself and husband.  Their payment statements are easy to read and their rates are unbeatable.  Most importantly, we have an amicable relationship with the co-owners (Robert and Stacey) of this company.  They have very good bedside manners and our communication with them has been seamless and smooth!  We just renewed our lease through American Horizon because we trust them and feel this company goes above and beyond for us!!<//Review>

I've had a great experience with American Horizon. They are friendly and very responsive to concerns as a property owner. Stacey has been great in keeping us informed about our property, and explaining any necessary repairs, as well as handling tenants. They are definitely a cut above our previous management company, and more reasonably priced, too. I'd recommend them to anyone, without any reservations!< /Text>

American Horizon Realty was so wonderful. We were needing to sell our home in San Diego while living across the US and needed a realtor we could trust and be there for us when we could not. Rob was perfect for the job. He not only handled all the situations that occurred of unexpected repairs, but he made sure we were not taken advantage of since we were not anywhere near our property. I could not be more satisfied on the outcome on the sale of our home and how quickly he was able to sell it! I would definitely recommend him to sell your house!< /review>

I have been a client of Robert and Stacey Bussell for almost 7 years, and they have been fantastic.  I have worked with them to buy/sell property as well as for property management.  I have property all over the country, and they stand out as superior.

I am a long-distance landlord, and I have relied on Robert and Stacey.  They are honest, ethical, and have tremendous expertise in all matters of real estate and property management.  I trust their judgment in servicing my tenants and protecting my interests as the property owner.  They respond quickly when issues arise, and are very easy to communicate with (I am often challenged by being deployed or on the other side of the planet with limited avenues of communication).

They have really taken care of me and I can't recommend them highly enough--they are top-notch.< /Text>

I can’t say enough wonderful things about Stacy, Heather and Nancy at American Horizon. I was new in town....didn’t know much about the area. I was relocating from Southern cal. This team of wonderful women helped us understand the area, safe places to live, and shop....and helped me find the perfect home!  Always retuned calls promptly, and went the extra mile to assist in our search by showing us several homes that fit our needs. Thanks so much, American Horizon for everything!</Review>

<Review>I have rented from American Horizon Property Management for over a year now, and have had a great experience. Every time I need service, they have someone contact me immediately. The rental process was smooth, and they have always been very helpful. I would recommend this property management to anyone looking to rent a home!</Review>< rate>

<review>American Horizon did a great job for us. We were from out of the area, with pets. We needed a high quality rental quickly. Robert showed us the right house. The application process was easy. The move in and move out process was professional and personal. Service requests were taken care of promptly. I will likely use them again. I am very comfortable referring American Horizon to friends and family.</review><user_name>Jeff Jones<//user_name>< gmapID>

Very rude and ignorant people working here. The process takes weeks to months and they do not return your phone calls, even though you have left a message. They have poor communication skills with customers and it seems they don't know how to communicate with each other as well. I did everything they said to get qualified and at the end I never got qualified, despite meeting their standards. So happy I went with another property management and I got qualified with them in a matter of days.
I see that they replied, but continue to lie. They never sent me anything in writing. They continue to say I was suppose to be a roommate, yet I don't even know the people who live there. I made it clear on day one (also have proof) that I was never suppose to be a roommate. The people who left the property also told me this property management is terrible, which is part of the reason they left and wanted me to takeover. Do not go to this property management!! Every property management in Sacramento area is better than this joke and I will be speaking with their corporate manager soon. They think I told them how to do their job, but they literally need to learn how to do their job, or hire more qualified people.< /review>

I rented from American Horizon for almost 7 years at two different properties. I've been at my most recent residence for almost 6 years now. I'm pretty easy going, so I haven't had a lot of problems and, even when I did, their staff was always great at communicating and helping. My garbage disposal went out and they had someone there to look at it right away. It couldn't be fixed so Nancy had it replaced that same day. It was always like that with them and, boy, do I miss it! Sometimes it takes things changing for you to know just how good you had it. A new management company took over my property a few months ago and there have been nothing but difficulties ever since. The owner Robert used to drive by the property all the time and make sure things were being kept up which was GREAT! But really, what I miss the most is their online bill payment system for paying my rent, that was so easy!< /Text>

American Horizon does an incredible job for me as well as my tenants. The real value of there service is in tenant placement. I learned the hard way trying to manage it myself. Stacy is always easy to get a hold of and keeps me informed.
Keeping my tenants happy and renewing their leases is paramount. Hats off to Stacy, Robert and their staff!< /text>

<response>None</response><Pics>None<//Pics><text>I've contracted with American Horizon for a year to help manage my rental.  My experience with them has been fantastic - their management of property has always been on the mark - quick notice of any issues that the renter may have, prompt payment to me every month.  If issues arise, the staff is friendly and helpful to resolve whatever discrepancies exist.  They have contracted their own repairmen and landscaping crews, so repairs and maintenance on the home is very reasonably priced.  Coming in to my experience, I had to go through the eviction and small claims process on a former tenant.  Robert, the owner, was kind enough to help advise me to prep effectively for my legal troubles at no additional cost to me.  Stable, high quality renters for my property were found within 1 week of initially listing this on a wide variety of websites and ads.  On top of it all, the monthly fees that American Horizon charges are very reasonable and negligible compared to the peace of mind that this company provides me for my investment.  As a landlord, I definitely recommend going with American Horizon for all your property management needs.</text></record></dataset><record>

< review>
I was American Horizon rental property client 2012 to 2017 and seller client in 2017.  In 2012 I needed to live elsewhere from my bank owned primary residence.  My expectations with American Horizon was simple – Pay the bills, prevent the property from depreciating, sell it at the right time.  Meanwhile, keep me out of costly trouble with the mortgage company, insurance company, IRS, county, city, association, and tenants.  Tenants funded the bills and wear and tear until it sold for above original listing price.  In the five years, I broke even.  What I expected and received. No money was ever spent without my authorization.  I actually didn’t meet Robert and Stacey until the house was in escrow.  Good people.  Just tell them what you want, and they’ll take care of you.< /review>

<text>American Horizon Property was the property manager for my rental home in Rancho Cordova. They did a fantastic job in every aspect. Nancy Marshall who actually looked after this property was extremely professional and efficient. She fixed everything in time if something needed to be fixed. She did a fabulous job in screening the tenants and got the model renter every time. The last tenant left the home in immaculate condition after almost 4 years. The office staff was also very helpful.
Thank you, Nancy!

We had a house in Roseville that we bought as our family home in let 2000. In 2008, amid the bursting real estate bubble, I had a job change that meant we had to move from Roseville. We contracted with American Horizon as property manager, and they placed our first tenant. That tenant immediately trashed the front and back yard and we began getting complaints from neighbors. When the first tenant moved out, American Horizon placed the second tenant. That tenant immediately vandalized the house. And when that second tenant vacated we found dog feces literally two inches deep throughout the living room, doors smashed, human feces on cabinets and even on the florescent lights in the kitchen.

I initially allowed American Horizon to begin repairs, but it quickly became evident that this property manager seemed very comfortable with extravagantly spending my money.

We fired American Horizon, rebuilt the house, and hired another Property Manager who placed a good tenant in the home.

I am writing this post now because I just spoke with a friend of mine who was also using American Horizon. My friend's harrowing story of his house recently getting trashed sounded oddly similar to my experiences with American Horizon.

Unless you are ready and willing to have your property destroyed, I advise against using American Horizon for you property management needs.</Text>

<review>I have been using American Horizon to manage my property for the last 6 years. I totally enjoyed Robert Bussell’s management  of my property. I live out of the area but I lived in this property for years prior to renting it out, Robert took care of all issues as the property was located in the country and all sorts of issues could of caused disaster but Robert always was perfessional and any problems he made sure I was taken care of along with making sure tenants were also taken care of, because of this when it was time to sell I used Robert Bussell to sell my property and he actually sold it for $20,000 more than what I wanted it listed for sale, again he handled all the problems associated with the sale and was very grateful.</review><name>Robert Simms</name>< user>

Stay away from this place at $3.72 @ gallon for premium; they're catching people not aware at this price, ridiculous.  Just down the street at Palm, the Mobil is $3.13 @ gallon.  Stations like this that are exploiting people should be called out.</review>

<Time>1402598342584</Time><rating>1</rating><review>I have a brand new car and only my wife and I have driven it in the 2 weeks we've had it.  We took it into the Shell car wash to get it washed.  We had a phone charger with a USB port connected in our car.  Some time later after getting the car washed, we noticed the charger was missing.  The storage area between the front seats had been tampered with and the charger that had been plugged in there was gone.  We returned and asked the car wash manager what happened to the charger and did they remove it to clean the car.  We asked to have it returned.  Of course they knew nothing about it and denied taking it even though they were the only ones who had been in the car besides us.  This is a warning to remove all items before having your car washed in this facility.  They have lost a customer.<//review>< Pics>

Got in quickly.  Got caught up on all vaccinations, toenails trimmed, and neccessary meds.  Staff are friendly and efficient.   Best place in the surrounding area for all your vet needs.<//text>

I like going to this veterinary  service, they are friendly and nice and actually care about your pets. Since I have lived in Coarsegold, I don't go anywhere else. They have seen me through happy times and sad times.</Review>

Horrible experience!  We had been going  here for a couple of years for our pets. I had a senior cat aged 23 who was dying and starting to suffer I took her in and was advised she needed over $700 in tests. All of these tests were inconclusive and it would take more money for more tests which my husband and I declined. Shortly thereafter, on a Sunday, she fell extremely ill and could not breathe when I called Coarsegold vet 1st thing Monday morning they didn’t have any appointments available for my suffering baby. I couldn’t believe the callousness in how they told me this. I had to go to Oakhurst to have her put down. The vet there told me she obviously had cancer probably lung and she should have given medication to help her in case this happened. Coarsegold vet had no compassion for this patient even tho we had spent over a couple thousand dollars there that year.<//review>

Hello, we are one of the multitasking cat and dog parents.
We had to go to a veterinarian hospital with one of our west highland white terriers. The problem was we just moved here and didn't know any. I remembered a vet by driving trough Coarsegold . We stopped went in the office and explained the situation. The nice lady behind the reception told us to come next morning with our dog.
So we did. When we got there the next morning someone else was behind the reception , not so helpful. She was so unfriendly and bossed us around , that I decided to go. Arrived at home I called the vet office and ask for the assistant that gave me the appointment. I explained what happened. She apologized for the misunderstanding and convinced me to come back.
We picked up our little dog after dental treatment in the afternoon. He was very tired and I was sad to see him suffering. The nurse gave us instructions and medicine and said he will be fine.
It was like a miracle, the next morning he was back playing eating and bagging for sausages.
This veterinary hospital is awesome. In the meantime we had to go with our cats and the other west highland terrier. Always perfect.
The rough nurse has changed too. She is very helpful since.
The fees are not low but reasonable for the result and the professionalism.</text>

Thank you Dr. "Drew"!!  Made our initial visit very pleasant!!  You were so kind to Stella, who we had brought in to get spayed.  Did a thorough exam which you walked us through verbally with full explanation of findings.  Excellent surgical outcome!!  She did NOT require having to use a cone with the way you did the sutures... and she NEVER has bothered them.   This is day four, HEALING nicely, seems to be without any pain.  She is a Queensland Heeler and with that being said.... 😁😣... IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP HER "QUIET" for 2 days, much less the recommended two weeks!!
Again, thank you for your personable attitude and EXCELLENCE as a veterinarian!!  We've made you Stella's doc!!❤😃❤< /review>

I do NOT recommend this place. At 8am, the waiting room was dirty, mud everywhere and hair balls. Receptionist just proceeded with her paperwork, then disappeared.
I was made to wait in consult room, no chair, suspicious stains on table. At 8am.
Doctor examined the growth on my dig's mouth and decided to remove it, but wouldn't make a diagnostic. No exam, no temperature taking.
When I came back 5 hours later, lunchtime, vet was on the phone and wouldn't see me. No request for follow up, no details of what they cut out.
Nurse said my dog had no stitches, even though he had 2 that needed to be taken out.
Careless, unprofessional staff, filthy rooms.< /review>

This is Absolutely the Best vet services we have ever gone to!!!!!!!
They were recognized to me and well wirth the 45 minute drive there.
The Doctor was kind and knowledgeable about our concerns. He talked in a nice soft caring voice and treated our fur baby like a Princess!
The nurse was equally as caring,  so was the desk lady.
They gave us options and were never pushy.
The flea drops we bought ftom them are miracle flea prevention drops!
Truly, if you live within an hoyr of them GO! You wo t be dirry
And the fee was extremely reasonable.
20 Stars wouldn't be enough!< /review>

Took my pitbull Niner in because he had a large lump on left side of neck/throat. No appointment, Monday morning, they we're busy but still managed to see Niner right away. Dr Pludow assessed Niner and performed surgery to drain the abscess and had him ready to go later on same afternoon, very thorough home care instructions and the compassion these people at Coarsegold Veterinary hospital is second to none. Will always use them for routine and emergency care for all my animals needs.</text>

My dog had an unknown emergency. I was alone and wanted to take him there since I thought he might bleed to death or have internal bleeding. Instead of taking him in they referred me to a VET ER about a hour away and there was a detour during that time due to a rock slide, all because they were about ready to close. I will never go there again, for anything and do not recommend them at all.< /review>

<review>My dog did not show any signs of being scared or abused,which helped me be more at ease and trust the vet with my dog.

Went back a few months later to get my dogs nails cut. It took them forever in the back room. When they finally brought him out he had thick rope burn around his neck!!!  I told them before they even took him back there DO NOT put that rope his neck he has a Collapsed Trachea. I was so FU@#^UI(OP.< /review><gmapID>0x8094214d6e1de5d3:0x39e24756a0aa51df</gmapID><resp>None</resp>< date>

Tony’s motor service is a true gem! Smart cordial and very attentive to detail, they fixed and improved all the little (and big) problems that my car was experiencing. I had just purchased a 1988 Volkswagen and I needed a repair shop that knew how to work on older cars, Edwin and the team took excellent care of my vehicle and left it running smoothly and purring like a kitten. Tony’s motor service is my new go-to mechanic!< /Review>

Edwin and Tony Motors just treat you right. Straight forward and honest. Fixed my 2001 jeep suspension problem. My vehicle had been at three different shops and nobody could figure out the problem. Edwin was all over it. Very quickly he figured out the problem and had my ride all fixed up. Finally the jeep I love has come back to life. Thanks to Edwin and the guys at Tony Motors.< /review>

Edwin advised me on my car’s oil leak, showed me the leak,  and explained what to do next.  I so appreciated him sharing his expertise and provided a pathway forward for my car.  I will be taking my car back for any repair and have already referred him to a friend.  Thank you, Edwin.<//text>

My Smog was up for this years registration on my 94' Toyota 4runner and it didn't pass for the 1st time in the 8 years I've had the truck. I surprisingly had a hard time finding a shop that would not only help with fixing smog related issues but also pre-1999 vehicles. Edwin and his crew came highly recommended by other local mechanics and they gladly excepted the challenge and went above and beyond to get the job done. Truck now runs better than ever and they got it to pass with better than normal emissions. Great shop and crew with an eye for detail. Thanks guys!< /Text>

My Prius is over 200k, I knew it was a bigger job going in, but they were so kind to talk me through the top 3 things they thought were most important, then being perfectly honest that the items down the list are important but not urgent. That safety first for my road trip, and over time I can think over the other parts. It was a Saturday, they were fast and efficient. Very trustworthy!

Totally dependable, it was time for an oil change on my car and they were so detailed with the inspection they found my motor mount was broken and my rear brakes needed to be resurfaced. My car was running a little bumpy and loud. After they got done with it, it was smooth sailing and back to being nice and quiet.    Tony’s Motor Service is honest and dependable.</review>

<review>Edwin was very helpful. He went out of his way to help me with all my necessary repairs and maintenance. His crew is courteous and professional. He helped me find and install the perfect belltech shocks for my chevy crew cab and installed belltech street performance springs, did chasis welding, new muffler and pipes and new brakes. I’m very happy with my truck and the work Tony’s Motor Service did on it.< /review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

< Review>
I left my car with Tony's on the recommendation of Edwin's stellar service by a friend. Him and his crew checked out my car while I was traveling to find the source of a check engine light. That light didn't come back on until my return and it was a different code BUT they did discover a few bulbs out and tested my hybrid battery PLUS installed the new tail light I bought a year ago after I cracked it.  Will be bringing my car here from now on. The guys here are good at what they do,  care about their clientele and have fair prices.  You can trust Tony's.<//Review>

I have driven by the shop many times, and I always see different types of vehicles. So I figured that this shop would be very versatile. As a first time customer, I brought my 95 GMC work truck. It wasn’t giving me any cold air. Well, I definitely have cold air now, thanks to Edwin and his mechanics, I recommend this shop to others.<//Review>

< Review>
Took my car here to get the engine checked since the issues were more complex than what my regular mechanic deals with. Edwin was immensely helpful and thorough in explaining what was wrong with the car, as well as what options I had. Not only did he take his time talking it over with me, but he also did some research to find me several actual price quotes of my different options to help my decision making. I ultimately ended up getting rid of the car versus putting more money into it since it was older, but I really appreciated Edwin's help and customer service. Additional, they kept an eye on my vehicle even when I was stuck out of town during the pandemic and needed to leave it there infront of their shop.</Review>

After wasting time and money at two other shops, I finally found Tony’s Motor Service who properly diagnosed and fixed the problem with my car. The job was a big one, but Edwin explained every step to me in a way I could understand (I know nothing about cars) and was honest and forthright with his opinions and pricing. My car is running like new! I would definitely recommend this shop to anyone with motor troubles!<//review>

<Review>They are the best mechanics in the west L.A. area hands down. This should be your "go to" mechanic. The owner is incredibly nice, put me at ease, his staff is top notch, I recommend this place highly. When you find a place that works for you, does what they say,  and delivers on time, you stay with them, as I will always refer and use them.

I had a great experience at Tony's. Edwin and the mechanics that work there were very helpful by driving me over from their place o Enterprise in the morning so I didn't have to wait to be picked up. They replaced my motor and did a lot of work on my car to get it up and running. They got my car done in five and a half days! Because they were so efficient it saved me money on the rental. My car is a 2003 Honda and it now drives like a new car! I would highly recommend them. I got honest and efficient service!</review>

Tony’s Motor Service took my car in immediately after I called even though there were several other cars in there. Edwin was extremely cool and helpful. They replaced my car battery, filled up a quart of oil, and to top it off they replaced one of my headlights free of charge! You can’t beat this auto service or this customer service.

I went to change the oil of my car and do a check up and he took the time to explain to me the status of each part of my car (even took pictures and videos), told me what looked good and what should be replaced in the future. I'm very satisfied with the service, 100% recommended!</Text>

Well, I happen to own 4 other cars and now I have found one of the best mechanics on the Westside with this referral to Tony Motors!

Edwin and his team at Tony Motors know their cars and now my 1989 Honda Wagon runs probably the best it ever has! The service prices are very reasonable too. All I can be say in is I am so grateful for the referral to be Edwin and his team at Tony's Motor Service♥️< /review>< pics>

Edwin is like an "Old School Doctor" the kind of doctor who made house calls and treated you like an old friend, not a patient.  There aren't too many around like him anymore. And his talented, knowledgeable crew shares his philosophy. There may only be 5 stars up there, but I'm giving him a ten!</Text>

Edwin was great. My check engine light came on due to a mistake on my end. Not only did they scan my car and get me on my way with some handy advice, but they installed the license plates I've had sitting in my seat wells for forever for FREE. Incredible people and service.

The people working here are great, and the service they performed was really fast. I hope they did a good job...who really knows, right? My car is running...but my 'check engine' light still blinks for what seems like slightly longer than it should when I start my car.
My main complaint: it's expensive...the hourly service/labor rate is high. I don't recall exactly how high...but well over $100 per hour. They were very clear about the hourly fee though...verbally, and with signs. I will be doing more research before I go back.<//review>

<Text>I LOVE MY CARS!  And I believe THE TONYS MAGICIANS LOVE THEM TOO!!! I’ve driven classic (641/2 Mustang,) a VW 72 Karman Gia I drove for 22 years and now an old grey lady CRV that is 21. I’m physically challenged so the SUV suits me and needs to live forever. All our family cars have been at
TONY’S MOTORS for maintenance and in their
Intensive Care Car Unit and lived to come home. I just took the CRV in and asked Edwin for one more year of life for her and he laughed and said I can give her many years. I’ve spent about $1500 on her in the last five years. And one set of tires.  And, I always get a complete explanation (snorefor all expenditures and future needs. And everyone I deal with is kind and trustworthy. My cars prefer Tony’s guys over any other mechanics. Don’t fail to try them out.</Text>< Pictures>

<Text>These guys are amazing!! I called in randomly to see if they could take a general look at my 1979 Corvette and frankly , they were BETTER than the corvette "specialists" I had gone to before discovering Tonys. While I was picking up my car,  I noticed they were working on cars from multiple manufacturers so I have complete faith they can handle any car I brought to them. Polite , to the point , and excellent pricing. If I could give them a 6 out of 5, I would! 😊<//Text>< UserId.>

Fast and excellent service. The final bill was less than the original estimate.  How often does that happen in life?  I would definitely recommend Tony's Motor Service to a friend or family member.<//text>

<Review>Very professional and at a good price.  Edwin evaluated my car's problem and then told me all the options I had and the price.  I got my car back the next day and it was running like a top.  I get better gas mileage now and my problem is fixed.  I won't have to buy a new car for awhile.  You can trust their work and at a good price.< /Review><rating>5< /rating>< pics>

Tony's is the best shop on this side of town!  Edwin, George, and everyone else there are super helpful and will answer all your questions.  Just as importantly, their quality of work is excellent.  So far I've had them replace an engine mount and a clutch, plus some minor stuff like fluid and filter changes.  They will have my business as long as I'm living in LA.<//review>

OMG!! BEST WORK INTEGRITY EVER!! Sends you a text  messages  with photos pictures and detail results of your 19 check point..
Car was ready in 48hours

NO B.S. NO HAGGLING OR HASSELING BEST SHOP IN TOWN best RATES IN TOWN!!
Before I made it to TONY MOTOR SERVICE
SEVERAL MECHANICS LOOKED @MY 2005 BMW X3 TOLD ME (BY MOUTH )ALL SORTS OF THINGS WERE WRONG.. never showed me anything just suppose to take their word for it.

THOUGH EVERY LIGHT ON THE DASH BORD WAS ON... AND AS THEY  POLITELY  SAID ( It was lit up like a Christmas Tree)..
Ed( the machanic who assisted me during intake of my car) encouraged me not to worry its probably not that bad wait until we get results from his 19 point check!!
He was SOOOO RIGHT!!! There were several minor minor things ...like missing Fan belt needed when other shop said my whole air system was bad Smh😖😟😤😣Thank  GOD I FOUND Tony Motor Service IM BK IN THE GAME READY FOR SUMMER.. air Blowing hard and COLD💨YAAAAS THANKS GUYS!!
-I HAD NO USE or control of my steering wheel controls... I DO NOW!!!😏
-DRIVER DOOR CONTROL✔✅👏🏽
-TAIL LIGHTS NO LONGER HAVE A MIND OF THEIR OWN ... IM BACK IN Business back I'm back in CONTROL!!!
And though it's always nice to recieve what u pay for  it's the little things that I wasnt  ask to pay for... like the tighting up of my side mirror seals ... and educating me on the need to keep the seals tight to protect electrical systems in that area WOW !!
THE GUYS DEDICATED TWO HOUR ON JUST MY FUSE BOX!!! Which was a big deal seeing how everyone else said my whole electrical system would need to be redone.😱😱. the lies. ...once again THANK GOD FOR TONY MOTOR SERVICE  and their  HARD WORKING CREW !! #&GREATWORKETHICS BTW WONT DISCLOSE THE PRICE BUT LEST JUST SAY THE ENTIRE JOB was LESS than the quotes other shops were giving me to work on just One Issue SMH🤦🏽‍♀️ at them and Thsnking GOD for TMS- Tony MOTOR Service<//Review>

<text>My experience was great with Tony's i went to another shop and they put my Ford explorer sport on a scope and told me I had to replace anti lock brake system and it was like a grand so i told them no thanks i went to Tonys and they put it on there scope and it told me i just needed a sensor they ordered it an hour later $100.00 and i was out the door i would recommend them to everyone!

They also fixed a water thermostat housing and its been working well for a long time with no problems Thanks Edwin at Tony's!<//text><resp>None<//resp></record>

I know that sounds like an exaggeration, but really, I am so, SO grateful to him and his team. I had to have my 1987 VW Cabriolet towed there after it wouldn't start, and he was able to work with me to get everything done over the phone because of my crazy work schedule. He was so patient in explaining everything to me in detail (exhausting detail, being the control freak that I am... I am sure I wore the poor man out with all of my questions) and so honest in his recommendations. I was a bit gun-shy at the beginning because of a recent negative experience at another shop, but my faith in mechanics has been restored-- I will absolutely bring my car back to Edwin in a heartbeat. I have no hesitation in recommending Tony's Motor Service to anyone and everyone!!!</Text>< user_name>

I went here with a 68 Pontiac GTO that needed work complete asap (issues starting, fuel line leak, various electrical issues).  Edwin had the car ready the next day and fixed all the issues and explained thoroughly what had to be done, plus got it all done at a very modest price!  He even had a shuttle to pick me up and drop me off once the vehicle was ready.  Very happy with his service!</Review>

<review>Chuck & Tony took care of me like I was family. I had gone to Chuck's place for a long time before he closed, so when he moved to Tony's I knew it would be a great place. They took fabulous care of my 20-year-old Pathfinder (R.I.P.) and never did unneeded repairs. they stand behind their work, too. Sadly, I no longer work in West L.A., so I've had to move to another place. But you can totally trust these people.< /review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<rate>5</rate><text>Mark, at Tony's, helped me out of a pickle (Aug 2016).

I drove from my home in San Diego to UCLA on a Sunday morning. Parked my Miata and attended the five-day teachers' conference. On the last day, I noticed green fluid on the parking lot floor, under my car's motor.

After making several calls, Tony's was recommended to have my Miata towed. My vehicle arrived at noon, and by 3:00pm, my leaky heater hoses were replaced and the cost was very reasonable.

Mark and his team at Tony's were magnificent, and got me and my car safely home to SD.

Thanks, Tony's for being awesome!< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<text>It's so nice to be able to go to an honest can competent mechanic!  My car was leaking oil and had been burning oil for a long time.  I brought it in to Tony's and they were able to discover that the problem was caused by a leaking oil pump.  Now my car no longer leaks oil and even burns a lot less (some of the burning must have been leaking!).

Thanks!</text>< pics>

I went today (01/05/2021) just to purchase some snacks as it is walking distance from my house. The attendant was so rude. I was trying to ask a question and he got agitated. Started telling what you want, what you want with hand gestures. At that point I replied nothing thank you. Did not do a purchase and will not do a purchase with them again.<//text>

The cashier was acting so weird he was staring at my card like he have never seen a card before and seemed like he’s memorizing it !! The transaction was approved he went ahed and gave me a copy of the receipt and kept one copy. He then wrote my id number on top of the receipt  Which made me question him. I asked him what the heck hes doing why is he doing that he couldn’t explain him self !! This weird act was reported to the police And they advised me to watch my account and report any suspicious activity.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Dan/Don...the older Asian man installed alternator on my car incorrectly as I declined to purchase part from him (double price paid from automotive shop). Had master mechanic speak to him and he admitted doing it and offered card signed by him for gratis service.
When I went for service he refused .
Very low character person.
Do not trust him with your vehicle!!<//Text>

<review>Requested a pin by phone to transfer my number a week ago and was told I had to wait 24 hours and no one got back to me. Decided to go by the store for immediate face to face service and at 4:45pm there is a note on the door that says "gone to lunch back at 5:35pm". Are you kidding me? Lunch? They close at 7:00pm they couldn't wait? Where is the manager? At lunch too?< /review>< gmap_id>

< review>
Really great experience from the moment I walked in until the moment I left! Enzo was extremely helpful and made my experience an enjoyable one. I came here to upgrade from an iPhone 6 to an iPhone 12. Enzo greeted me right away and started working on getting me what I needed. He set me up with the new phone and all of the accessories and upgraded my phone plan so I won’t be charged for overage data every month.  I didn’t feel pressured to buy anything and it was an overall enjoyable experience!  I love my new phone too!</review>

I am delighted to say that my experience at the Pacifica Verizon store was Wonderful. From the moment I enter the store and was warmly greeted by the staff everything about my purchase of a new iPhone 12 was positive. I was assisted by  Enzo who is knowledgeable, super friendly,  personable and dedicated to providing excellent customer service. He asked the right questions.  He knew the answers and if he didn’t he knew who to call  to find the information  quickly. And he kept in touch to let me know when my new phone was ready in the store. If you’re looking to get a new phone or new phone service, then the Verizon store in Pacifica Is the place to go.< /review>

Davidson was very helpful and patient with us while we were trying to swap from my old service provider to Verizon. Nice guy and very knowledgeable about all  of my questions and concerns. Hopefully I will be able to deal with him the next time I go to the Verizon store.<//review>

Terrible- Absolutely the worst Verizon store I’ve ever been in. Not to mention the worst customer service experience I’ve ever had. I was literally yelled at and argued with. I’ve been with Verizon for over 25yrs and sadly considering changing services after several experiences at this Linda Mar location. The level of ignorance, arrogance and rudeness I experienced is truly astonishing and not at all what I expect from Verizon. I was actually told by the workers there they felt justified in their behavior because they are a subsidiary, not a real Verizon store. I stongly suggest someone from Verizon make a site visit to follow up. Otherwise I’m sure the number of customers are going to start dropping and I’ll not be the least surprised to see this store closed well before the year end.<//Review>

Went into the store not expecting much. Jaron and Marco were very helpful and knowledgeable about their products and helped me pick out a phone that works for me. Very happy I switched to Verizon, I would recommend this store to anyone.</Text>

Marco in the Pacifica store was outstanding to deal with. I've recently had several bad experiences with Verizon stores, mainly the Vacaville branch.<//Review>

Ryan was very supportive in explaining the features of my new phone,  the transfer of data and the cost of the new plan.  It was a pleasure to  meet him,  in addition, he suggested I might bring any new questions back to his attention.<//text>

<Review>Worst customer service. I purchased the new iPhone Max here. After one week the phone still had reception problems: static, dropped calls, and went in and out. I went back to the store and they told me to update the phone. I updated the phone. A week later the phone still had problems. I went in today and the sales person was the rudest person I’ve ever encountered. Not only did he open the store 15 minutes late he said he couldn’t do anything for me becuase I was past my 14 day return date. I’ve had the phone for 16 days. Then he tried to sell me a SIM card for $10 and said that might work. I asked him they should do that for free and he said he wouldn’t. I told him to call corporate and he proceeded to tell me that nothing could be done. Customer service 101 something can always be done to keep the customer happy. He then proceeded to tell me to get the F out of the store. I videoed his behavior and wil be sending this to corporate. He refused to give me his name. If you’re a manager this happened on November 17 at 10:30am. He needs to be trained. Although I wouldn’t waste my time training someone who can’t be trained. DO NOT GO HERE. GO TO A CORPORATE STORE!!! THIS IS ONLY AN AUTHORIZED DEALER, THIS PLACE IS A SCAM.< /Review>< Name>

Best in town!! I would suggest Carloni’s office to anyone seeking a Chiropractor. Friendly and professional staff works hard to get you in and set up and out quickly! Has an awesome set for this time of COVID!

I trust the team so much not only are they my go to but they also handle my husband and teenager daughter! With all the books she carries at school spinal care is important!</text>

I was in so much pain when I went to see Dr.Carloni. He explained every step of what he was doing or going to do. The past chiropractor simply popped my neck and back( which hurt even more). Dr. Carloni was patient,  through.
I am able to get out of bed ( not roll), and go through the day without taking pills. This was after my FIRST visit!!!!!</review>

< Review>
Dr. Carloni is the Doctor of Chiropractic aI have been searching for 15+ years now.
I have over 200 documented hours of chiropractic care from the past 30 years and understand well rounded, solid techniques of adjustments and balance control and Dr. Carloni displays these characteristics to me.
Dr. Carloni's practice manners are top notch and his adjustments are VERY accurate with a non-invasive adjustment touch.
I HIGHLY recommend anyone with body extremities health issues or in need of nutritional balancing to schedule time with Dr. Carloni.</Review>

<review>Carloni Chiropractic is your one stop shop for all things alternative for your wellness needs. The nutritional testing is wonderful to assist in ailments you may be suffering from. I have had digestive issues for years, and although I eat very clean and exercise regularly, I always have troubles. I have been on a program now for 2 months and have never felt better. I am sleeping, waking feeling completely rested. My skin is clearer, and my stomach has not bothered me like in the past. Highly recommend!<//review><name>Chelsy Bell</name></record>

Dr Carloni and staff are amazing. I have had a few sports injuries and Dr Carloni has worked with me through these and had me back out on my feet asap. Very personable and pleasant, it's an appointment I always look forward to. They have your best interest at heart and always show you the best healing and preventative measure to take.
I refer all of my family and friends who have also become life patents.< /Review>

<Text>I recommend Dr. Carloni because he pays attention to detail!  He genuinely cares for my total wellness.  His office is friendly and provides me a lot of support.  I can't imagine seeing anyone else for my chiropractic services.  Very nice offices in Stockton and Woodbridge.

Thank you Dr. C!!  See you soon!<//Text><gmap_id>0x80900db2b3e8b623:0x4d738fe2574fab84< /gmap_id></record>

I can't say enough about Dr Carloni and his staff.  I always feel welcomed and receive the best treatment.  I've been seeing Dr Carloni for a few years now and tell everyone one about him.  Again I can't say enough.  If you need some work done this is the place to be.

I got in a bad car accident, my body was all out of wack and in terrible pain. Dr. Carloni did incredible work on my collarbone, neck and shoulder and got me up and rollin. I can't thank him and his staff enough. His diagnosis was remarkable and his estimated timetable for recovery was exact. Very welcoming and hospitable staff. This is where you need to be.<//Review>

<Review>David is a crook. Be careful and spatially when he does mechanical labor.He charged me for genuine Honda parts and after investigation it was found made in China. Number of the parts  he replaces can not be found in catalogs.My problem is a continuation of his fraudulent activity and how to get a dishonest person out of the market!<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

I could have been happier with the job David did servicing my car.  He's prompt, courteous, and his prices are very reasonable.  I don't take my car anywhere else for work.<//Review>

<Text>I agree with others. The pumps here are indeed the slowest ever. Turn up the pressure please! Or install some new pumps. The flow rate is ridiculous!

Only good thing here is the price. It's not as high as other places.< /Text>< userid>

< Review>
I've been craving some authentic Thai food, and for anyone that's spent significant amount of time there, you know how hard it is to find a restaurant that recreates the tastes here without watering down their menu and flavor for the western palate.  Esan totally hit the spot, with the explosion of flavor, spiciness.  Going to have to come back to try the chili lime fish, and many other dishes!< /Review>

I do wish the Tom yum soup was more because it was so good.

Usually we have to ask for more rice but that wasn’t a problem here :) !<//review>< Pics>

<text>I'm a big fan of the TL location of Lers Ros across the street, so I was very excited to bring my friends for a group dinner to try the food from the Isan region of Northeast Thailand at Esan Classic.  We were not disappointed.

The vibe of the place is fresh, open and airy with a strong wafts of fish sauce coming from the kitchen...a sign of good food to come.  I had called to reserve a table for 6 and everything was ready when we arrive.  The service was friendly and accommodating.  Esan Classic is a better spot for groups than Lers Ros in my opinion.

Being our first time to we wanted to try a variety of foods. We ordered Esan sausage, fried garlic frog legs, chicken wings, grilled top sirloin,  whole fried bass with herbs, veggie pad kee mow, stir fried morning glory, crispy fried catfish (bits), sticky rice, fried ice cream, and coconut sticky rice with mango.  Everything was solid and tasty. Favorites generally were the sirloin, chicken wings, pad kee mow, morning glories and desserts.

The fried catfish bits are very tasty and unique almost more like a topping if you will, but itself it doesn't work by itself.  Along with other foods it provides a delicious crunch.

I was most excited to try the whole fried bass with herbs and it was a bit of a let down.  The fish was overly fried and too small for the amount of herbs and sauce. It overpowered the fish...when you could actually find a piece of meat in the pile. We also though, flavor aside, the fish should have been larger for the $35 price tag.  The presentation and style of frying was impressive however, and the the flavors were good, just not proportionate.  And those chicken wings were addictive! We all agreed we could eat them for days.  The frog legs unfortunately were also fried too hard, its nice to get a crispy bite but if the meat is dried out because its  been fried too long, thats not tasty.

I also appreciate the wine list at Esan similar to Lers Ros and reasonable prices.  A delicious bottle of spanish Albarino went perfectly with our dishes.

I'll be back to explore this menu a little further since its huge.  Looking forward to it!< /text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP0ZLVLTvhuruY_tlvLfn0M0gvnmFNe9xchw5k-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN2XUJ8dleU9ieUF0F5A-qcs9qXVUpi9bj1arYs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< Response>

I was excited to check out Esan Classic hoping to try cuisine from a lesser known region of Thailand but instead found dishes that tasted very much like every Thai restaurant except that they were over salted or excessively sweet.

The menu bafflingly suffers from having over a hundred items and the decor looks like Hard Rock Cafe. It's really disappointing considering there's definitely room in the city for a differentiated Thai restaurant.< /text>

<review>This place was an accidental find: we missed our lunch reservation and decided to go to Esan last minute. It was empty at that time but the space was very clean and neat. I wasn’t expecting great good Coz it wasn’t busy but THE FOOD TURNED OUT AMAZING. I mean, just look at the pictures. The service was good. The beef was tender and done well and tasty. Very satisfied with our last minute visit!! 👍🏼👍🏼< /review>< gmap_id>

I enjoyed everything we ordered. Very authentic. Some plates are even more delish than back in Thailand thanks to the US beef I guess. I will definitely come back when I'm in the area.< /Review>

The amazing neon sign outside draws you into this modern, upscale eatery. I ordered just the Penang curry. The flavor profile was complex with the right amount of heat for me. Delicious dining experience in a cool place. Would come back again.</Text>

I have eaten here 5 or 8 times. It is a nice clean upscale for the immediate area restaurant.  However, aesthetics aside it is quite delicious and has never let me down. Also they seem very kind with warm greetings and they keep an eye on my table to anticipate my needs.< /Text>

<review>I loved the water spinach dish with had subtle flavor and anyone who loves salad would love this dish.
Tom Yum veggie soup was a bit on the spicy side and very very fresh. If you are someone who doesn't like spicy, just tell them so they can reduce the green chillies :)
Panang curry was just perfect with white rice.
Love the ambience and the customer service.
Will visit again soon.<//review></record>

An absolute favourite! You could get dizzy with the mouth watering choices on the menu. Definitely a place to check out if craving north eastern style Thai food. Portions are very generous and staff are friendly.  Their fried chicken wings(with garlic and chili) are not to be underestimated!< /text>

Most authentic Thai restaurant outside of Thailand! Love Issan cuisine in Thailand and am happy to have such a great place in our city! Forget about all the sugared up Thai places on every corner - this is the real deal! Service is always friendly and accommodating. Ate there last night and am craving it again right now 😁< /text>

<review>Authentic Thai food with an overwhelming menu. The staff is extremely helpful in recommending chef specials and staff favorites. They also have several beers on tap (Singha, Sapporo, Anchor, etc) as well as a small wine list. If you are not feeling adventurous or unique they also have the standard Thai favorites. Quite locale in a busy Tenderloin district.<//review>< date>

< Review>
We had the panang, green curry, fish cakes and vegetables roles. The panang had NO vegetables in it what so ever. Taste was good, but really spicy. My boyfriend was satisfied with the green curry. The fish cakes were awfull, greyish in colour and weirdly squishy, we could not eat these. The spring roles too were uneatable, tasted as if they dropped the peber bowl in there and bad ratio of dough to vegetables.< /Review>

<Review>Really poor food. The whole place smelled like fish. The water they served smelled like fish. Chicken was overcooked and tasted like plastic, the soup had no flavor, the Pad Thai was really hard like it was made yesterday and dried up. Poor all across the board. Service was fine though. Overall, would not recommend. We ended tossing the food, wasted $70. Overpriced too for the location/quality.</Review>< time>

Look and feel (atmosphere) is very cold but a soon as the food is arriving you´ll be impressed.

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>With the restrictions lifted in orange county indoor dining is now available at this location. Not to many patrons at 8 am. We were placed several tables away from others and felt very safe and comfortable. The service was quick and friendly. I was told when more people are present they open the outside dining.< /review>< pictures>

Greatest hard working waitress with superb service of top quality food. Worthy of a $20 tip for a $21.00 tab.  A great restaurant experience in a difficult time.  Good job IHOP and your staff.</text>

<review>Good selection for any time of the day.  The food wasn't bad and we had good service.  The price was a little high but it's a chain restaurant so I expected that.< /review>< Pics>

Super slow service, the floor was wet with no warning cones and my grandson slipped and fell hitting the back of his head my son and my wife were talking to the manager when one of waitress came and told my wife and son you know we have video. Who in they're right mind would even say anything after a 3 yr. Old falls and hits he's head. Grandson is fine now.< /review>

I was seated very promptly. My server was Josefina and she was very attentive. I tried a spinach and mushroom omelette for the 1st time. It was very good.</Review>

<text>We ate here last November and the dining room doesn't seem so clean: the booths felt greasy when we sat down, and the air feels stale.   Service was very slow and the workers didn't seem so happy.  The food was pretty much what I would expect for an IHOP but this location seemed depressing and unclean.< /text>< user_id>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>The restaurant was very clean and the service was awesome. The food was hot and tasted great. Our server even told us when she was going on break and introduced us to the server that would take over. They both took care of our group. It's nice when your server comes back to the table more than once. Which they did! We even were sent off with a very nice goodbye. I would definitely recommend this IHOP.< /review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Restaurant was empty.
I should have taken the hint....
Service took forever.
Waitress never checked on us.
Had to flag her down any time we wanted anything.
Food was meh, except for the pancakes.
They were pretty good.
Not coming back.  Price vs. Quality is way off.</review>

< Review>
Restaurant was empty.
I should have taken the hint....
Service took forever.
Waitress never checked on us.
Had to flag her down any time we wanted anything.
Food was meh, except for the pancakes.
They were pretty good.
Not coming back.  Price vs. Quality is way off.</Review>

We order two senior BLT sandwiches.   Each sandwich had one strip of bacon, burnt.  Our waitress was awesome!<//text>

Where the service is friendly enough, the food usually is served in a timely manner, it has a smell to it. Where the syrup is kept could be a bit cleaner as well as the tables wiped down a bit better. The coffee isn't always fresh - meaning it's not always served hot.  With that said, I do eat there a few times a month because the breakfasts are pretty good. They are currently remodeling- maybe that will help with the smell.</text>

Food and service were great then I had to use the ladies room. It was clean but the smell nearly made me gag. This establishment needs to address the sewer smell issue immediately.<//Review>

<text>Ok so when we came on saturday at 5pm  arrived and before we parked I knew it wouldn't be a great experience. Why ? Because the parking lot was deserted... this has to be the slowest IHOP in all of orange county. Any how we didnt turn  back. We went in using the door on the right because the right one was broken.. still we stayed. The table had dried syrup tracks on it.  I ordered the breakfast sampler and honestly the only thing that tasted ok was the hashbrowns .. the eggs needed salt, the bacon was not good (how can bacon not taste good??) The sausages where too crispy and they tasted like cardboard.The pancakes were good. Service was real good. My Son said the bathroom was dirty, toilet clogged and urinal didnt work.  We wont come back. Next time I see an empty parking lot in a restaurant I wont come in. Service was good.<//text>< user_name>

People came in and sat across from us got coffee immediately . No one came to take our, order bring us water, or deliver coffee. this place sucks and I'll never come back here again.

We, the four of us, were seated immediately. The foods offered didn't fully strike me as atypical. It was, however, consistent with prior visits to other​ IHOP's...meaning their quality (and prices) were acceptable and predictable...also meaning this is a business of integrity throughout. Only gripe was personal in that they no longer serve biscuits and gravy (so what?). The service was impeccable. Clean and well lit, I recommend this IHOP to anyone looking for a tasty  breakfast or lunch.< /text>

<Review>"This is an appreciated expansion to the Placentia region.

Opening only two or three days prior, one could undoubtedly observe the place still needs a touch of tweaking. It's delightful and clean however fairly meager.

The most critical thing, the espresso. Obtained from a neighborhood roaster, the latte was magnificent. Rich and waiting on the palette, the espresso surpassed my desires!"<//Review>< Pictures>

<Rate>3</Rate><text>It's IHOP if you like IHOP it is an okay one. The food and prices are okay, they are not cheap but not expensive either. Food tastes okay, for the price. The biggest problem with this place is the staffing. I live close to this IHOP and every time my wife and I go there is only one server and one cook and there are always 4 or 5 tables(usually at least one family of 4 or more) with usually one more waiting to be sat or waiting to pay. The staff does the best they can but it takes forever to get service because they are understaffed. This has happened 3 out of the 5 times we have gone. Management needs better staffing but other than that a normal IHOP.</text><pics>None<//pics><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x80dcd69c5a922ba3:0xc4b5caa24ba2dc5a<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

The wait was only 5 mins because I made the window right before the Sunday rush. My server was excellent. The only downside was where I was seated. Right beside me was the stacked highchairs & they were frequently shuffled right beside me. Still my favorite IHOP in my area though.< /Text>

We would love to love this place. We live so very close. But everytime we come, the dining area has no music at all and they insist on seating everyone in a small cluster, so you hear everyone's conversation and chewing. It is not pleasant.</Text>

Took too long to get seated and we we're the only ones waiting! Go figure. So many tables empty and the kid put us in a tiny table. When I asked for a bigger table he told me I would have to wait 10 more minutes!! I said forget it. When my waitress came to our table I asked her if we could move she was very hospitable and said yes. I was thinking what was that other kids problem. Make your guests happy right!< /Review>

Service was very slow at this Ihop on this visit. Orders took over an hour and some items were left out. Short staffed on the floor and in the kitchen. It was as if they were going out of business. There was a notice that they weren't accepting gift cards. They should have just closed the doors.< /text>

Decent, I feel this I hope is weak in the sense of the food being poorly presented on the plate. I waited 13 minutes to get silverware and my sister only got half her meal. Stay far far away from the cheeseburger omelette. Disgusting</Text>

Had a terrible experience today at Ihop. Both my orderes were made wrong. I had gotten my coffe and no creamers and I told the waiter and she did not bring it. I had to get up to ask again for it because she would not come by the table. I had to get up again to ask for ketchup and napkins. I asked for the bill and they took too long to bring it, I ended up having to go to the front and they had me waiting a long time, I ended up having to leave without the change. Terrible experience and I have been going here for year. They are just getting worse as time goes. This was the last call never returning again.</Review>

The new crepes with cheesy sauce are delicious! And the beef sliders. This is a very quiet Ihop surrounded by residential. 4 other tables in use at 8pm.</text>

Good, wholesome fare, friendly staff.  Can be very crowded weekend mornings, but evenings are less hectic.  Try the omelets.< /text>

The new crepes with cheesy sauce are delicious! And the beef sliders. This is a very quiet Ihop surrounded by residential. 4 other tables in use at 8pm.<//Text>

<text>Service was not good. He did not introduce him self. He never smiled and when he brought the food I was worried all of it would fall on the floor. To top it all off the presentation of the food was not appetising. It looked like it had been slapped together and it was cold. I hope management can fix this problem. IHOP has always been my favorite breakfast place. Sad to say not this time.< /text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

Martin, the manager, knows how to run this restaurant with efficiency and great customer service.  The IHOP on Lincoln is closer to me but I prefer to make a slightly longer drive to Placentia because I feel at home here.< /review>

<text>Just ok. Restaurant was clean, staff was friendly but foot was overcooked and portions were very tiny. We were a party of five, we had salads and different entrees for each. None of us liked the food.</text>< pics>

Good food, nice people, but the portions seemed to get smaller on the hash browns.  When it gets busy the floor seems to get neglected but that is understandable for a crazy Sunday morning.< /text>

<Review>We were n this one dec 1, 2015. Very few people, still had to wait. Silverware dirty, food very badly prepare. Waitress said everyone (help) walked out so only one waitress & only one cook. Phone kept ringing. The waitress, the only one did the very best she could...
Will never go back to this one ever or anyone I know. Give that waitress a raise, treat her right b/4 u lose her..< /Review><gmapID>0x80dcd69c5a922ba3:0xc4b5caa24ba2dc5a</gmapID></record>

<text>If i could give zero stars i would. We walked in with our family after a very long & hectic travel day at 930pm. They close at 10pm. After unloading all 5 kids they wouldn't seat us and were only taking to go orders! NOT OK! If you're often until 10p you should be seating customers until 959pm.

<text>This location is close to my home, but the place needs some serious updating; the electric socket above our table had no cover on it. Prices are too high for a facility in this much disarray. I know the Sunday after-church loves it, but you got 👎👎 from me.<//text>< Date>

If your sign says you're open till 10pm then you stay open till 10pm, not send customers away at 9:30pm saying "Sorry, it's to go orders only."  Terrible... Will not return to this location.<//text>

My only complaint is they shouldn't assume all customers are going to want flavored cream for their coffee, we got more flavored cream than regular cream, and didn't have enough for a second cup. It is an inconvenience to have you flag down anow already busy waitress. They should ask before bringing the cream out< /review><user>109831846559906623092<//user><rate>5< /rate>< Response>

"I'm only giving this place a five-er because i am hands down in LOVE with IHOP's CORNMEAL PANCAKES. it is cornbread but pancake style. I LOVE cornbread..so if you love it too then go to IHOP asap and order a large stack of cornmeal cakes.

haha. ok, this location is great.. they are very nice and quick with the orders.
i wish they were open late.. but they close really early just like everything else in placentia."< /Review>
