I really enjoy having Dr. Hopkins as my eye physician. Her professionalism and thorough examination, gives me great confidence every time I go to her. One of her greatest attribute is that she really listens and documents what you’ve said about your eyes any challenges or difficulties that you’ve had in the past year. She also takes a great deal of care and understanding your about professional and personal wants/wishes for contacts or stylish, professional eyeglasses...let me rephrase that fashionable eyeglasses.

Over the past three years I’ve had two different insurance companies, and she has taken both of those insurance for my examination as well as my lenses.<//Text>

It’s hard to find an optometrist who takes time with patients these days, but Dr. Hopkins is fantastic. She helped me find a new contact lens that stays put (I have an astigmatism). The staff is also great. Very cordial and helpful. Offices were super clean before the pandemic and of course are super clean and sanitized between every patient now.</review>

<Text>Posted closing hours misleading!!!  I called at 5:30pm letting them know I'm on my way to pick up my contacts and will be there 5:45pm.  Receptionist told me they're done with their last patient and are closing, even though, their posted hours state they close at 6pm on Tuesday.  What's the point of your posted hours if you're going to close after your last patient anyway!?  I'm glad I called and didn't drive there for nothing!!!  I'm am really upset they were not willing to stay open for me to pick up my contacts!  Shows how much they care and value their returning patients!!!< /Text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

Dr. Hopkins practice is very professional.  She and the staff are great.  She did not try to push new glasses since my prescription change was only slight.  She has a new machine that can see into your eye without dilating the eye.  I recommend this practice< /text>

Lauren is very knowledgeable and explained my insurance and I knew exactly what my copay was. Jim is he Optician and he helped me pick out the greatest pair of glasses for every day use and my sunglasses too. Thank you Jim.

<text>Dr Hopkins has been my Optometrist for almost 20 years.  She is pleasant and professional.  Glaucoma runs in my family and she checks for that along with other eye issues to keep my vision sharp.

I am in good hands with her and wouldnt go to anyone else with my sight.  Im an accountant so if I cant see I cant work - I trust her with one of my most valuable assets!  Thanks Dr Hopkins!< /text><Time>1583534414717</Time><rating>5< /rating>< UserId.>

This is a great place to go for all your Optometry needs. The staff are helpful and really go above and beyond. They even readjust my frames for free whenever I need a hand. Very professional and they have state of the art equipment. I highly recommend. Even though I moved a bit further away I still go to them rather than finding someone new.<//text>

<Text>I've been with Lisa for decades, but this review concerns my recent experience with her optician when I went in to get a new pair of glasses with the same RX as the ones I recently lost. I gave him the max # of stars available on the e-mail form (and above) and the one word "Outstanding." He was thorough, friendly but very professional, and very helpful with my selection of frames for the glasses.< /Text><gmap_id>0x80dd303ac65d15cd:0x99012feb8ccc5579< /gmap_id>< resp>

< Review>
I went to Dr Hopkins for the first time and she is amazing and Jim fixed my old glasses perfect. I was upset when I picked up my glasses and notice before I even put them on were damaged. I remember the receptionist put the glasses that I picked out to the side. I thought those were samples and they would order a new pair. Lady try to adjust my glasses and didn't do a good job and are slipping on my nose and tight on one side and when I left wasn't given a case for my glasses and had to go back to bemind them. Can hardly wait for jim to fix my glasses.  This is Unexcepable service for glasses and being billed close to 860 for glasses.</Review>

I look forward to seeing Lisa Hopkins every time it is time for my eye exam!  Her examination is thorough, she takes time to listen and answer all of my questions;  the atmosphere in the office is unhurried and professional, and I appreciate Dr. Hopkin's friendly and natural countenance.  Her staff is helpful and knowledgeable and they sincerely care about the details involved in fitting your new glasses perfectly.  I highly recommend her to anyone concerned about their eye care. This post is written my me, Sheila Musselman, wife of Howard Musselman, and as he has the same sentiments as I do regarding Lisa Hopkins, I will leave his name at the top as if he were the one writing the post.</Review>

I have been going to Dr. Lisa Hopkins for the past 15 years.  She is always up on the newest methods for evaluating eye health.  I had an emergency retinal tear years ago. The office got me in to see her immediately.  It required surgery and Dr. Hopkins quickly made the necessary arrangements for me to see an ophthalmologist that day.

She is a caring competent doctor.  I highly recommend Dr. Hopkins and her caring staff</Review>

<Text>There are so many reasons I am grateful to have found Dr. Hopkins when my eyesight began changing due to....I will admit, aging. I realized right away that she was thorough, efficient, and personable. I love her clean, modern office and the people who work there. They are always cheerful and helpful. Recently I had trouble with one of my contact lenses and was so relieved that the office was open after 5p.m.  and Dr. Hopkins was able to see me and resolve my issue immediately.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

State of the art equipment, scheduling and reminders. Friendly and efficient staff. Not much waiting around when you come to your appointment.

Dr. Hopkins is very professional, thorough and yet personable, explaining tests, your results, and your options patiently to the level of detail you need and ask for. My wife and I have been patients for years, and enjoy going there for our exams. Only need off-the shelf readers, so no pressure from the staff to buy any glasses.

Highly recommend Dr. Hopkins' office and to pay the extra out-of-pocket (insurance doesn't cover it yet) for the no-dilation exam - when you are done, you walk out and are ready for the day. Nice remodeling of the offices, can't wait to see it finished.   :O)<//text>

Dr. Lisa Hopkins is the best Optometrist I've ever had.  She is very professional, she is technically superior to other Optometrists I've been to, she goes the extra mile for her patients, and she has all the best name brand frames available.  Her staff is helpful and friendly as well.  Her office is also well appointed.  Going to Dr. Lisa Hopkins' Office is a top end experience.</review>

<Review>Lisa Hopkins has the most beautiful frames around.  I get comments all the time about how great my glasses are and I send them down to Lisa's shop in Naples.  Also the people who help you find the perfect glasses are both friendly and very professional.  They know all about checking your insurance, they know much more than I do and always volunteer to help.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Dr. Hopkins has been our optometrist for over a decade and has been providing excellent service to my wife and two boys. Her staff as also a pleasure to work with, and besides a great selection of frames, appointments are easy to schedule and she is always ready to advise and work with us. Highly recommended! :)< /Review>

<Text>Dr Hopkins is very personable and professional. State of the art equipment so for an additional cost there is no dilation. The whole process and results were explained well which was very interesting.
I only wear reading glasses but there were no hard pressure sales to buy glasses.< /Text>< pics>

Started seeing Dr. Hopkins when we lived in Long Beach. Now we live 90 miles away, but still make the drive to consult with her on our vision needs. She is friendly, helpful, and able to explain what our prognoses are in easy-to-understand terms.<//text>

Such a friendly and personable doctor. The office has the latest technology so that the least enjoyable parts of having your eyes examined are that much easier on you.

The office is clean, well-appointed, and everyone who works in it is friendly. I would recommend Dr. Hopkins services to anyone.<//text>

Very professional and thorough eye examination.  Prescription for glasses hit the mark exactly; the glasses she prescribed work well for me in distance, in mid-range (computer), and reading.  I have been going to Dr. Hopkins for many years now, and results are always the best.<//Text>

<Text>I have been going to Dr. Hopkins for years. She uses all the latest equipment and clearly is current in her medical reading, as she is always aware of what is new in eye disease.  I worry about macular degeneration, and she always remembers and tests me for it. I HIGHLY recommend Dr. Hopkins, she's great.  Also, she is always on time, so you need to be too.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

My wife and I have been patients of Dr. Hopkins since she first opened her practice on 2nd Street. We have always been completely satisfied with every aspect of her business. All of the staff handle their duties very professionally. Her selection of frames is great - something for everyone. We do not hesitate to recommend her to our friends.

She is caring, thorough and really goes the extra mile in her care for her patients.  I can't recommend her more.  You simply will not find anyone better - this is the truth.< /text>< Name>

(Translated by Google) I loved the attention, they were very friendly, in addition, they have high-end equipment and have an infinite number of frames. They are highly recommended.

<Text>Fast friendly delivery of my cheeseburger pizza and brownie to the truck while I wait to load at Pflug Packaging in Lathrop. I would definitely tell any trucker over here to not even hesitate to order delivery to the truck and if I pick up here I will be happy to order from this Papa John's location again. Thanks for the great experience, Manteca PJ!<//Text>< pictures>

The food was just ok. We waited longer for our order than they predicted. The Papadia was hard around the edges and they use a different kind of sausage than they do in their advertisement.< /Text>

The employees are sooo nice and respectful. I remember one time that i ask for for a cookie instead cookie dough and they fixed MY error. They never wasted my time or anything. They all do their jobs and it really shows in the food they make.</text>

" now you've spent the same amount of money on gas and a pizza you still have to cook...... did you even tip them at the store? Did you really??

Horrible.  They were extremely cheap with the topping. I have never been anywhere where there was hardly any pepperoni or olives on a pizza. Unbelievable. I will never order from there again!!!</text>

Just ordered delivery from here and our pizza came smashed to one side of the box. Our half and half pizza was 2 and a half slices to 5 and a half slices. We also ordered garlic knots and all of the garlic sauce had spilled and soaked both of the boxes. Very disappointing.</text>

If you are going to put out a promotional offer you need to follow through. I was told they were out of toppings which in my experience of working at a pizza place they should not be out of dough and still be open and able to take people in.

He is an older guy with thick accent and pepper colored hair. He does not belong in any kind of customer service position and hung up on me multiple times. We will continue to go to mountain like or jacks cafe over this place any day and sure with their customer service they will end up out of business soon!!!

If I could rate them a zero I would! They have very bad customer service! They don't honor coupons or prices! They'll give you higher prices when you call then when you walk in! They're always so rude. The past Four experiences I have had with them all been bad customer service and not honoring their customers.<//review>

< Review>
7/13/16@2003: Called and asked for delivery times and the woman stated 35 minutes.
I asked if I tipped a bonus if the delivery time could be shortened as I live literally 2 blocks from the store.
She hung up on me.
I called back and asked for the manager and the woman that answered this time asked me if she could help and I explained what had just happened and she stated that was the manager.
(For all those that are wondering why I couldn't just travel 2 blocks and pick it up) Because I have been drinking and I do not drink and drive.
I will be contacting corporate and filing a formal grievance.</Review>

<text>We ordered (and paid) online, they called the wrong number to confirm (and yes we checked, we gave them the correct number).... we waited for our pizza for an HOUR AND A HALF, called to ask them where our pizza was.... they told us they canceled our order and that we'd have to wait 45 mins for our pizza because they thought it was a prank. Who orders a pizza online AND pays for it with a credit card for a prank? NO ONE! If it was a prank we wouldn't have prepaid for it! I don't care how good your pizza is Papa Johns, I will NEVER eat at your place of business ever again. This was the worst experience. Thanks for nothing.<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

I Guess the reviews speak for itself.

I stopped by today after picking up a deli sandwich for my wife at the restaurant next door.  It was 2:14pm today 3-1-2017, and I didn't see anyone in the Papa Johns Restaurant until about 2:18 (No biggie, but you may want to take smoke breaks after someone is maintaining the walk in clients).  After my 4 minute wait, I asked the lady who finally came back in from outside (she also had an attitude as if I'm the problem for cutting her break shorter than she probably want)  "What are your specials for today?"  I failed to get her name, but she was possibly in her 40's, very thin and very very short hair.  She told me I could get the 'Ultimate Meats Pizza for $11.00'.  I said sure, lets do that but please do not add Pepperoni.

She told me, she has to make it just like the photo!  I waited for a second, because I thought this was some stupid joke.  Than I realized, she really must be upset that I came in as a customer to your business to place an order during your break!!

I told her "That does not make sense, UNLESS IT PRE-MADE and you are sticking it in the oven, make it without the pepperoni!!!

Once again, she said "I have to make it like the photo".  This still boggles me!!  I had to break things down to layman's terms for her.  If this is a simple 3 topping pizza, and you only add 3 of each toppings, I just want two of those three toppings, 3 of each as you would normally do and charge me the same price.  This way your business makes more money, more product, more profit!!  She said understood, but she can only make it like the photo!

Well Papa Johns, you can keep your strict pizza ordering guidelines, because I will never go back here again.  Does not take rocket science to hire someone with a little common sense.

After my 5 minute debate with your customer service, when I finally started walking out, she yells "OK I CAN MAKE IT THE WAY YOU WANT!"

I don't care if you paid me to eat your pizzas here, not happening!

Also on the corner as I pulled out there was a sign $11.99 (Just .99 cents more!!!)  Large Pizza any Toppings!!!!!  WOW!!!! JUST WOW!!!!

I took my business to a local family owned Pizza place in manteca where the customer service has always been top notch.

One star is too much for this place.< /Text>

<Review>Ordered first time. I have been told pizza will be delivered within 30 to 35 minutes.  Called after 45 mins. Pizza was still there because of only 1 delivery guy. Pizza was delivered after 1 hr 15 mins. It was cold. Never going to order again.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

I don't eat pizza but fam says it was great. I called and placed the order and the gal on the phone was rude and was not knowledgeable. I asked how many does a medium feed and she says I don't know some people eat the whole thing...I asked what kind of soda do you have sge says what kind do you like. Seriously their staff requires customer skill training!</Text>

I sent three kids to CCA. It is simply extraordinary. Academics are superb, as are performing and visual arts and sports team. Most importantly, the kids are kind to each other and tolerant of differences. This school is well worth the ridiculous mortgage I pay!<//Text>

<Review>Everyone has a different opinion and I think that needs to be taken into consideration. Although I don't go to this school, I lived in the area for 11 years. When I was looking at high schools to go to, this was one of my options. All of my friends were applying to go to school here. At the time, I thought it was an okay school. It wasn't my favorite though for many reasons.
The first reason, is that the course schedule was very funky. The whole four-by-four schedule is very interesting. I don't agree with this teaching style because I believe that Math and English and Core subjects should be taught year round. The electives, such as dance, art, acting, etc, should be taught half a year though. For example, if a student takes Math first semester and then has to wait a whole year to take math again, they will likely forget important information in that period of time.
The second reason, is that the teachers are quite odd. I personally think that it is a good idea to implement video clips and have visual representations for certain material, but not to just show videos and not really go in depth. I also think it is a good thing to have a good relationship with your teacher, but to spend time during the summer with them? It just seems a little....different.
My third reason, is that the statistics for the school academics aren't really that high. You really need to factor in that more than half the school population is Asian. These people come over for a year or two and send their children to school in Carmel Valley and then move back to Asia. Students aren't taught that differently to make the academic scores that different. And now that schools have to use the Common Core curriculum, things are going to change a lot.
My last reason, is that everyone acts the same at the school. For example, almost every girl is like a Feminist all the sudden and bashing the school dress code. The guys are a little different, but overall, almost everyone at the school is snobby and rich. They live in a bubble and don't really experience the real world. Both men and women should dress like they respect their bodies and not wear something revealing. They also need to respect the school dress code and rules. Crop tops, strapless shirts, and spaghetti strap tops shouldn't be allowed.
As I said in the beginning, this is just my opinion on how I feel about the school. I don't think it is a horrible school, but it wasn't the right school for me and what I want to achieve in high school, college, and sailing.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>4<//Rating><Text>Great Performing Arts program, sports, and all that but on the inside I get info that I made a better choice, I spent a long time looking at this school, wanted to give it 5 stars if I could and thought a lot about it.  IN North County it would have to make the list. I know at this size, it's tough to deliver, with all the busy parents making the big bucks and I felt like the staff was pretty awesome, but it turned out that it was the PARENTS that sealed the deal- while there, I saw some of them that I had been associated with in previous programs and after I was exposed to them I was so relieved to have had my daughter choose a different school. I little vapid, huge, and it's a tough commute for anyone coming from the busy freeways- the other thing that bothered me about it is there's the entitlement and the top performers seem to be not so self actualized, in the end. There's more, but it's hearsay.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

Top of the line, highly academic and rigorous (if taking AP), and colleges know it. This is a great school for you *IF*: 1) You are willing to pre-take a class during the summer prior to your fall classes. This school's 4X4 program moves very quickly, and you will be sorry if you miss important concepts. 2) You are willing to spend long hours on homework and manage to balance outside activities (colleges want outside activities). 3) Find yourself a good tutor! 4) MANAGE YOUR TIME EFFECTIVELY. This should probably be #1. If you don't manage your time, you will be very stressed out and fall behind. To be a successful student here, you truly have to be very diligent about staying on top of things, be self-motivated, and hard-working. If parents have to be on your back, this is not the school for you. The differences in the academic quality between this school and bishops with the $30K price tag, is that CCA has larger classes and some teachers are not very supportive (with regards to extra help). Now that there will be more kids coming in because of a lawsuit that let in all freshmen (and possibly change the policy permanently), it will probably be more difficult for these teachers to offer help.<//text>

I think it is unfair, and unhelpful to publish reviews of this amazing school from people who don't even attend. If you are reading the negative review written by the person who openly admits they only "drive by" CCA; please immediately disregard.

This school is fantastic. It is staffed by gifted, talented, and caring teachers and administration. The school culture is remarkable. It is an outstanding school where a student will receive an education that rivals many costly private institutions. Additionally, students from all walks of life, of all shapes and colors are welcomed and accepted. CCA is a leader both educationally and globally.</text>

The greatest school I have ever been graced to attend completely redefines the "high school experience". CCA is the most LGBTQIA+ accepting place ever (and I go to school in San Francisco;  quite possibly the gayest place on Earth); I'm talking young-men-&-women-killin'-it-in-eight-inch-stillettos-wearing-flowers-crowns-with-a-pride-flag-wrapped-around-their-shoulders-and-nobody-looked-twice-gay-acceptance here!!! The Envision program is absolutely amazing and the staff were/are just the most down-to-Earth, kind-hearted people I have ever been honored to meet. Mrs. Zuniga (Chuifo at the time), Mrs. Brittan, Mr. Black, Mr. Spilkin, Mrs. Zanoni, Hector, and so many others have taught me valuable life lessons. Words cannot express how grateful I am to have attended this truly one of a kind school.

Although I didn’t go to this school, many of my peers did. I heard its reputation skyrocketed upon its opening. At the beginning, the campus was under construction. In 2004, it opened for only 9th graders despite being under construction. Then 10th grade is added with upcoming 9th grade students. At 2008, the school is nearly completed. So the first graduating class were mostly people who were born in year 1990. I don’t have anything else to mention because I didn’t go to this school. Some people like it there, some people don’t.<//Review>

<review>cca is pretty cool. don't expect people to be Different and Beautiful and Kind all the time because that's not how the world works, buddy. the people are the same as everywhere else, and it's Your Job to find a group of people that you like and want to grow with.
it's high school. nobody's going to baby you and pretend that just because you're going to an arts school that people are going to be Nicer or Better. they're normal people. get over yourself.
other than that it's nice and the 4x4 is stressful as hell but i have SO many classes that i can take now it's Litty. study hard but don't forget to have fun & be young xoxo< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

I would not recommend CCA. While I have learned a lot and grown, much of it I would not like to go through again. This idea of "the CCA vibe" is a myth, at least as far as my graduating class goes. Ever since my freshman year, people have been rude, judgmental and entitled. People don't come here for the opportunity to get better, they come to get a sh*tload of AP's, regardless if they learn anything, and leave. There is little to no sense of community and outgoingness, no willingness to try new things. The SJW's aren't out there, in general, for all of us, just themselves, no matter how pointless or stupid what they seem to advocating for is. The 4x4, that has been lauded, defeats the purpose of education. It is impossible, unless you spend 24/7 studying and being tutored, to truly delve into depth and learn what we go over. And even then, most kids just cram for the tests. The interest people have in giving back to the community and doing something has dwindled and dwindled.

I've even heard *gasp* that CCA is now basically the same as TP.

There are opportunities here and some awesome teachers and students (and Admin), but don't come in with rose-colored glasses and fall for what everyone says. Make up your own mind.

I would not have gone anywhere else, because I have learned immensely about myself, life and people in general. And I have been in the front seat of so many changing factors of culture. There are many opportunities here, and coming is not a bad choice. But before you commit to going, make sure you have honestly looked over everything and make a cognizant decision.</Text>

Canyon Crest Academy is incredible. Phenomenal. Unparalleled. In the four years that I have attended this school I have grown and learned more than I could have in a decade of my life elsewhere. It challenged me to work harder and be smarter. CCA demonstrated how the arts can play a role in day to day life and offset seemingly tedious academics. The student body shares a diverse and fresh set of ideals, ripe for discussion and collaboration. It's impossible to not fit in and the school will guide you to find what your passion truly is. The teachers all do what they think is best to ensure that the students attain their highest potential. The community is a welcoming family that understands day to day struggles and puts in the effort to keep everyone happy. There are events almost every week so you can pick an choose what to take part in, and there is never a shortage of activities nor opportunities to explore. This school is honestly unlike any other, and you'd be hard pressed to find a better public high school experience in all of the USA than the one at CCA. May the students here continue to thrive, achieve success, and fill the roles of leaders that our world needs in order to make a brighter future.< /Text>

CCA was an amazing high school and the best choice for myself. It's extremely academically rigorous, and the AP courses are second to none in the state of California  (see US World News and College Report).

However, CCA is not for everyone. And that's okay. You have other great schools in the district to choose from. I don't understand why others are degrading the CCA ratings on Google if they didn't even go here.

CCA has historically been a very open-minded, strange, and rigorous campus. I've noticed that as the school expands, it looses it's "weird" charm that many graduates can agree made their experience at CCA.

Also, the school is now constantly shrouded in intense traffic from the overadmittance of underclassmen (2500 students now vs. just about 2000 students when I started), and the school and surrounding area were not built for it. The mall and middle school just compound the problem, however the diverse food options provided on the shopping center are very welcomed by upper classmen.

To summarize, CCA was a great school. It still is a great school. But it's not the campus for everyone. The 4 by 4 can be difficult to get used to, and the pace is demanding. But of you can balance all your needs, it is a fun ride.</text>

Worst school ever, don't ever let your child come to this school, teachers are purely doing this because it's their job, they never care about you, they just come and leave, never really make us learn anything. Do whatever way to get you a C on test if you've shown that you don't like him/her.</text>

<Text>We had an accidental sprinkler activation Sunday night (not related to fire or smoke) and Blackbird Fire was quick to respond and took care of us so we could open for business the next morning. It was late Sunday, Mothers Day, but they still responded right away. The work crew was professional and the price was very reasonable. We definitely recommend their work and service.</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<review>So happy we found Black Bird Fire Protection inc. to service our vehicle's fire extinguisher. Just in time for our off road trip. Luis Robles was very knowledgeable and helpful through the whole process. He made sure he could actually service our extinguisher FIRST before actually going there, to save me an unnecessary trip.

<Text>I had to get a sprinkler fixed after an inspection.  Richard and his team went through and inspected every sprinkler and not only did they fix one sprinkler but fixed others that weren’t identified on the inspection report just to be safe!  And at no additional cost.  They were quick and efficient and very reasonable compared to another quote I got.  Richard coordinated things with my landlord and the whole job was seamless!  Thank you!</Text></record>

A pleasure to work with. They know what they are doing, and get the job done quickly and easily. Everyone I spoke to was very kind and helpful. We've had bad experiences with other companies in the past, so finding this one was a breath of fresh air.</Text>

<text>We're very happy with our experience with Black Bird. After receiving a fire report for one of our buildings from the L.A. Fire Department, one of the issues we needed to address was bringing all of our fire extinguishers up to date. Luis came and was very professional, and kindly and thoroughly
answered all of our questions and concerns. Our extinguishers needed to be replaced with new ones, and it turns out our existing cabinets for them were not at regulation height (too high), and we'd need to outfit them with small hammers. Luis gave us recommendations on better places to relocate our less-visible extinguishers and moved them. He was also mindful of saving us the cost of purchasing new cabinets and said he'd use the existing cabinets, lowering them on the wall to the correct height and outfitting them with a new poly-scored plexiglass cover that could be broken open without a hammer. He also threw in new locks for them all, which was great. He did all of it that same day as the consultation.

There were other issues we needed to address on the fire report, and normally Black Bird could have handled them if our building had been located completely in Culver City; unfortunately, it's located right on the line between Culver City and the City of Los Angeles, falling more under the jurisdiction of L.A. city which requires a Regulation 4 testing certification. But Luis was happy to refer us directly to an affiliate fire protection company that could handle it, which we really appreciated.

Overall, it was very easy to work with Black Bird, and Luis walked us through each issue ticked on the fire report so we'd have a clear understanding of what we needed to do.</text>< Gmap_id>

Wow! Richard and staff: Excellent communication, excellent work, highly recommended!  I would give 6 stars if able to...   I have a condo on PCH in Huntington Beach where the copper pipe sprinkler system continually leaks and causes damage— all the pipes are eroded— most companies wouldn’t even take the job when interviewed since they were connected condos and not freestanding with HOA oversight— Richard came through with everything promised!  Thank you Blackbird!!<//review>

Richard was the technician who performed our work.  We needed an inspection and certification of our residential sprinkler system.  He also adjusted two heads that had "drooped" over time.  Some caps needed replacing and everything was performed in a very professional way at a very fair price.  Richard was professional and congenial.  I would not hire anyone else to perform service on our sprinkler system.< /text>

My home's fire sprinkler pressure relief valve and pressure gauge was malfunctioning, causing water to leak outside the house, promoting unsightly moss growth. Black Bird Fire Protection came out and replaced the defective parts. They had great service and the response was prompt.  Richard provided a thorough service and took great care to avoid water leaks during the repair work. I recommend them highly.< /Review>

Luis came out to service our restaurant fire protection system.  He is puntual, knowledgeable, and honest with what need to be serviced. I found out that the old company I used skipped some works, and they had charged me for what they didn't do because I did not understand what needs to be done.  Luis took time ro explain us how fire supression system works, and what to look out for.  10 stars!  Thank you Blackbird.<//Text>

There is no better fire protection service out there for the residential sector than Richard ar Black Bird. He is fast, professional, courteous, and always there to support your needs. He’s my go-to for anything concerning my fire sprinkler system.<//text>

So many staff members came out to talk to me and my friend. We trapped a cat that had been coming around my apartment wanting food. We brought him to you and you made sure he was neutered, vaccinated and flea treated. However, the Humane Society only tries to socialize and adopt out cats at 6 months and younger so we had to look elsewhere for help with this cat.  We were referred to another rescue and this rescue took the cat. The staff members were very nice and explained their position but it was hard to understand why cats could not be checked for socialization and put up for adoption. Young cats have a much better chance at adoption than cats over 6 months.< /review>

<Text>Its always" good times" at the humane society. They are the most dedicated animal lovers I've ever encountered. They like people too!! As far as my own experience, the San Diego Humane Society has been feeding my cats every day since the beginning of this awful pandemic. I lost my job right before the whole thong started. Things became increasingly desperate and these wonderful people are still there for us. THANK YOU EVERYONE AT THE HUMAINE SOCIETY< /Text>< Pics>

Once again a really wonderful place with wonderful employees I would not believe most of the negative 1 star reviews as most are plain out lies I have been to this place multiple times over the past years and all their animals look happy and well cared for.</Text>

A friend and myself arrived at the Humane Society parking lot today to find social distancing in effect and knowledgeable staff members greeting and answering questions for visitors.  There were pop-up tents with tables occupied by staff members. There seem to be a number of cars in the parking lot but only a couple of people walking about in the parking lot. We were  informed at that time that pet the adoption program was done only online now due to covid-19, (a good reason if you see this post... to look and check out the website's information to find out the proper procedure to adopting a new pet).  All in all although it was a decent bus ride there and a short journey from the bus stop, we now have knowledge of how to go about saving one of these furry fellows.  Looking online tonight to start checking out what is available here.

... Will finish completing the Stars for rating upon completion of the adoption 😉

Thank you Humane society,
J.R.< /text>

<Text>They're giving out free dog food, cat food wet and dry, and litter. Hrs from 10 am till 1 pm. They also have a page of resources for vet care. Take caution when choosing a vet. Vet's these days r cold hearted animal haters! I say this for a lot of reasons, but the most important reason is that i witnessed to vet's turning away an animal. One was a beautiful Siamese with a broken toe. The vet handled him so harshly that it turned my stomach and caused me to leave "b st. Vet" i think the area was called Normal Heights. The kitty screamed several times, but didn't let the cat alone until i intervened. The owner was telling the vet that she couldn't afford vet care, so the place said they couldn't care for the kitty without money. The same thing happened in Little Italy at the wellness animal vet. It's only a wellness clinic. A different woman, homeless, but didn't look or smell bad brought her dog in. There was something in the ear. The dog was so well maintained, shiny coat seemingly healthy. But again, the people wudn't even look at the pup bc the woman had nothing to pay with. Im now researching vets on line and i found veterinarians who travel across the country to help homeless people with all kinds of necessary needs like shots, spay and neuter, ear meds, all around anything an animal needs. This says a lot about what the people of this (curse wordS) country care about. Note from me to the readers: i am ur neighbor! I don't care who u r, what u look like, what uv done in ur past, or where u come from, if u need something i will go close to death to help u get it, bc i care about u and my country. I AM the epitomy of an AMERICAN! B4 Corona virus i needed help with one of my cats, so i called the san diego humane society. They told me if i wanted them to help my loved one i had to give up my rights to them. They would fix him then adopt him out. For $35 anyone could have adopted him. This country is crumbling from the inside out. I have so much to say but ill stop at this, WHAT THE (insert curse word) (insert 4 more curse words) IS P.I.T.A. GOOD FOR?!< /Text>< pics>

Excellent safe place for animals with extremely friendly, kind and caring staff!

They're doing such a wonderful job keeping social distancing and sanitary practices in order with the Covid-19 pandemic. ♡</review>

<Text>Told us every artist had a different pricing, didn’t hive us any type or price till after our tattoo was finished, 3 little lines less then an inch big. Cost us each $120 dollars. Never come here unless you’d like to be ripped off and not given any information until after it’s time to pay. Worst experience of my life.<//Text><Rating>1</Rating><gmapID>0x80e84d4739e38c3f:0xb16422888c0055f8<//gmapID><userid>116035688388291267348<//userid><name>Jared G</name></record></dataset><record>

Phil is amazing! His prices are fair, he’s very clean and professional! I never feel rushed but he also doesn’t waste any of our time. I’ve gotten several tattoos from him and will be going back for more< /review>

< Review>
Visiting the area from out of town and walked in hoping we could get tattoos.  We knew we were taking a chance, but went in anyway.  My husband and I both left with amazing pieces.  Thank you, Johnny for the flag and Cristina for the berries and bee.  Have recommended to friends and will make the drive back for our next tattoos.  My husband and I both highly recommend!</Review>

I got my tattoo done by Phillip and he was amazing! He made me feel comfortable and welcome and he has great attention to detail and has a passion for what he does. The shop was very clean and everyone there seemed very nice and would go back and recommend it to everyone who is getting tattoos or piercings.</Text>

I had the best professional experience I could have asked for. I went in knowing exactly what I wanted.  The customer service that was given to me was extraordinary! The Artist who helped me was "PHILLIP". His professionalism,  Cleanliness and years of experience was outstanding.  I am very grateful for this experience and look forward to Doing business again at famous tattoo!!! 💕😎< /Review>

<review>Went to famous tattoo for a cartilage piercing as I had been hearing good things about the shop and thought I would give them a try. Johnny was nice and welcoming and super knowledgeable! I really appreciated the education and commitment to safe piercings that heal properly. He was polite and answered my many questions, much appreciated and recommend highly! the shop was a little slow in getting to me but I didn’t make an appointment so it was to be expected.<//review>< time>

<Review>I was on my way home from a week trip and I had taken my nose ring out. They were kind and courteous, got me in and our quickly. Since he was redoing an existing hole he only charged for the jewelry and it made my day. Clean and nice inside the shop, just wish I would have tipped him more 😂<//Review>< pics>

Was introduced to Bobby via Instagram. He was quick with booking, super detailed and listened to exactly what I wanted out of a tattoo! Prices are extremely reasonable. The atmosphere of the shop is so cool, everyone is super friendly! Bobby did some amazing work on myself and a friend. I highly recommend him. Takes his time, and makes sure you're as comfortable as possible. Would definitely go back to see him.< /review>

< Review>
Jonathan Garcia is an amazing tattoo artist with a heavy American tradition style. He is very fast and clean. His work is bold and made to hold. I would recommend Jonathan Garcia for your next t tattoo.<//Review>

< Review>
Phillip is the best!
There is a reason he has so many good reviews on yelp. I decided to contact him after seeing all his good reviews . He seriously has the BEST costumer service and his art is even better! He created exactly what I envisioned! I will definitely be going back to him for future tattoos!</Review>

<Text>Long story short, I went in to get my septum pierced and the lady with the long orange hair messed up and placed it too high up in my nose. I called the owner and he let me come in and get it re-pierced by someone else. I'm happy with the results now.< /Text>< Pics>

Went in for a walk in appointment and Jon did an amazing job!  Poor guy had to deal with my nervous babbling, hahaha.  It was my first tattoo and he helped me through it.
Everyone in the shop was fun to chat with too!</review>

The atmosphere was great. But fiancee and I got a septum piercing and his came out pretty good. Slightly crooked but not too bad. Mine on the other hand came out really badly and super noticeably crooked. I'm very upset cause it was a piercing I've wanted for a very long time. Plus side though didnt really hurt for me. Going back in soon to get it fixed.</text>

<review>Worst customer service ever. I went in to have a piece of jewelry I bought in Santa Barbara placed and felt so uncomfortable during my interactions. It was like they were pained to be interacting with me. The piercer thought he knew everything (that my piercing closed up- it’s been 13 years, and the jewelry was too big for my hole- it fit up until this morning when I knocked it out by playing with it.) and then was told it would be 20 bucks. That was the tipping point- I walked out. No one smiled or was nice in anyway. Plus the shop is dirty. Avoid.< /review><resp>None<//resp>< user>

I went in to get my ear pierced (tregus) I like my piercing and everything is good so far. The place was clean (except for a little bit of ants) and the people were very nice however, I couldn’t give 5 stars due to a couple of reasons. 1. I paid $90 and that was after a $10 vip discount, so it would’ve been $100. I don’t mind paying for quality but I think $100 for one ear piercing is still a bit pricey ( just my opinion). 2. There was zero earring selection!!! All they had was the metal ball and you can either get it in stainless steel or titanium (for $20 extra) this was a huge bummer for me but I was already sitting and prepped for piercing so I just said whatever, and went with it. Aftercare instructions were somewhat vague but this wasn’t an issue for me as I do have some experience caring for piercings. Also, no cleaning solution was provided. From my experience you always get a cleaning solution, either complimentary or it’s included in the price of the piercing (especially if the prices are high). All in all it wasn’t a bad experience so I did give a tip.</review>

My first tattoo, was nervous but read the reviews on this place and gave it a shot. Couldn't be happier with how it turned out. Good crew, good environment and Bobby was awesome. Had a vision of what I wanted and he took it to another level.</review>

<text>I spoke to one of the artist about getting some piercings done and was told that they would be contacting me about a time. I waited a week and decided to contact them and ended up getting no reply. I ended up having to reach out again and was told a time. A few minutes before my appointment I texted again to verify and was told “she was feeling under the weather”. Honestly find another shop. Very very unprofessional and a waist of time.<//text>< pics>

<Text>I drove a little under an hour to come get a bellybutton piercing before they closed. I had arrived very close to closing to find out their piercer had left only a few minutes before. The staff made the effort to call and get him back. Despite leaving for personal issues, he came all the way back after hearing about our long drive. Great prices Monday-Wednesday only paid $30 which included jewelry. I was quoted anywhere from $60-80 at other places. Piercer was very professional, joked with me after i expressed my anxiety, and gave me a pack of Oreos after because i was feeling a bit dizzy. The piercing is straight, only a small pinch, walked me through the steps of what he was doing, and it is healing well! I will definitely be returning!<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x80e84d4739e38c3f:0xb16422888c0055f8<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I go to this superb place once a month since I like the  special atmosphere that is characterizes this restaurant. The staff is highly cordial and skilfull. The service is impressively rapid. Also, the food you get is perfect. I visited many times and I was always happy. The pay is modest. I highly suggest this restaurant to all my friends.< /Text>

SAVE YOUR MONEY. They don't pay. It's solely based on how much revenue it makes, since it's location is placed in lightly populated rural area, it doesn't produce much currency to dispense.  Its simple:
The more guest attend the more it dispenses. The less guest attend the less the casino has to payout. True for any indian op casino.

What a fun little casino. Has nice promotions. Extra $5 for seniors.  Has some classic machines, which are my favorite. Great ladies at the welcome center.  When I couldn't make my free play work, one lady came out and helped me.  Thanks so much.  And self serve beverages, how great is that?  Yes it's smoky, but hey it's a casino!!!! Just wear a mask, 10 for a dollar.  Works for me Haven't tried the cafe yet, but I top my tank at the gas station.  Will be back soon.  Oh ya I won $125.00 yay!!!!!!!!!!!!! 😄<//Review>

😞🤬😡 beware of fraudulent prices on menu clearly when they state something at $7 you could see that its a 7 but when they try to Put $17 on the menu they make it look like 11 not 17
Very devious and very misleading false advertising Oh I never buy the onion rings outrageously overpriced at $8.50 for a total 8 onion rings or less
I stop there occasionally only because I have no choice now I hope they  change their bad practices ☕️< /text><gmapID>0x80da15757b374a07:0x478af8d73172956f<//gmapID>< Date>

Small, cozy casino, limited table gaming a small convenience store for snacks and things overall nice but very small.  Therefore it's nice place to stop into as you drive to LA or back down south but I don't think one would go there just to go there the day.</Text>

Always our food/fuel stop on the way to Glamis or Ocotillo Wells. Fuel prices are always good, and the food at the grill is awesome. The staff in the convenience store could be a little more friendly. One tip I recommend is ordering your food from the grill in advanced as they are really slow.</Text>

This review is for the diner inside the casino.   We walked in and thought it was fast food place from the layout,  but were greatly surprised by the menu and quality of food.

Service was excellent,  the staff was wonderful. Thank you Cecelia.  I was blown away by my steak sandwich and my darling loved her hamburger.

If and when we come back through this will be on our list of places to stop and grab dinner.< /review>

Food selection could be better, but what they have is good and reasonably priced. Drinks are also very reasonable. Great location, good gas prices and a well-stocked convenient store with everything you need. Friendly staff. Worth a stop if you're passing through.< /review>< Pics>

Nice and very clean Casino. It's very small but it has all the great slot machine that you will really enjoy playing. The gas prices are the best you can find and there players booth is right in the front as you walk in the main casino entrance.<//Text>

<user>102033897909901605570</user><review>Reviewing Red Grill.
Positives first: Reuben sandwich. Good. Sour, salty, tangy, slightly cheesy. Very good. Food for the table was brought out together.

Negatives: wait time from ordering to receiving food was high. One person serving as server/cashier/waitress for the restaurant. Plate was greasy, bread was overly griddled to the point of starting to blacken. Price is a little higher than average. 2 teas, 1 sandwich, 1 burger $29.05

Overall a good place to stop by for food on the way through.</review>< Time>

I have only lived here for a week, so I haven't been anywhere. Yet. This is for the Ashley. that in her review she complained the cashier wouldn't look at her during their transactions. I just want to say there are worse things in this life than someone not looking at you.  I am not saying this woman cashier is Autistic, but not looking at someone is one of the signs of some thst are. I know because my grandsons are Autistic, I have neices and nephews thst are .  If this woman is, she's doing fantastically well at her job.<//Text>

Quick and convenient, but it is not for non-smokers who have issues with the smell of cigarettes. That would be a personal matter though. Even the restroom was well stocked and maintained.</text>

They lure you in with enticing offers but when you get there,  they find a way to not honor it. These Indians don't deserve land or a casino.  I wonder what other secrets lie in the filthy promises. Is there food fresh? Highly doubt it from the smell it gives off. Don't stop here,continue on to the other casinos that don't lie and jerk your chain<//text>

<Review>Always did very well at this Casino - Over $2800.00 wins on $40.00 play.  And again last year over $1300.00 win on $10.00 play.  Always had fun here.  However, to many people just walking around watching only for wins.  May have to ask security to walk you out of you have any sizable wins.  If your winning you get plenty of drink offers; however, not winning you need to get the drinks yourself.  Now several months later.  Was playing Buffalo Gold,  with a 2.25 bet when i hit a Bonus round, ended up with all 15 golden buffalo's and 109 free spins walking away with $4140.00  total put in machine was $45.00   Always did well here,  I usually spend the entire day, never had a problem with the exception of a few begging for cigarettes or loose change... You got to be kidding asking for those things in a Casino...You that broke why are you in a Casino?< /Review>< userid>

<Review>Was here for New Years and so the area was quite busy as usual. In trying to avoid long lines by the gas station, Jack in the Box etc., we opted to head towards the Casino and found this little restaurant. It was clean, food was tasty, service was very friendly and there was NO croud!! Give it a whirl on you next visit to the desert in Salton City. Breakfast, lunch and dinner are  served.<//Review>< pictures>

Not trucker friendly at all!!!! one trucker was being harassed by two security guards because he was working on his truck. I noticed another guy threw his Trash Away in their dumpster and walked in behind me and two security guard women approached him to tell him not to be digging through their trash ... At that point I jumped in and told them he was throwing his trash away and I just left never go back to this place</review>

Overall being one of the closest casinos to the city of Brawley also known as being in the county of Imperial Red Earth Casino has done very well for itself and for the small communities around it. It has a gas station that is the cheapest gas station from El Centro Calexico at least as much as I seen up to $0.05 cheaper than Brawley lowest price gas and it also has cigarettes zetor not of the familiar name brand however they are $4 a pack which does come in handy since cigarettes everywhere else has one up..... They could have more customer service Representatives as well as for better equipped security to handle those drunken crowd that sometimes are out of hand but overall to be near a small City with all these bigger casinos with your more well-known around it it's small and it just right for a lot of people including myself.<//text>

This is Home to me,   There is Plenty of activity going on every day that some of us player club members like to visit daly due to more cash back on freeplay and point play and even better cash money promotions,  live band music on Saturday night's and new slot games, every now and then and a Respectful head management that has made great changes on staff that now we can enjoy more time in tha casino and Travel center,  enjoing some good times solo, in a couple, friends or family.<//review>

It's worth the extra 7 miles to get gas & fuel,  always 10 to 20 cents cheaper than AM/PM. They do need to service their pump filters though.<//Review>

<Text>We are very pleased with our new garage door system. When we were gathering quotes, Sam was the only person to offer us multiple options around a problem we were having with the support poles. We ended up making new foundations and Sam completed the job in a thorough and professional manner. His attention to detail was noticeable. We want to extend our appreciation to Sam at Garage door star!< /Text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

Sam is certainly a garage door expert and we are glad we came across him when our garage door stopped working, it has been a while since we wanted to fix that door. He did a terrific job in replacing the garage door motor and related equipment with a new updated one in no time at all.  He was able to do this the same day we called him to come over. The garage door is so quiet now every time it is opened and closed, we love it!<//text>

I was very pleased from the first meeting with Sam up to the installation of the new garage door. I would recommend this service provider to anybody and I was very pleased with the quality of the door and look it added to the front of my home. Thanks again for a job well done!</Review>

It was a pleasure to deal with Garage door star. Sam came to the house, took time to explain everything and was very helpful in advising us in the selection of our new door. He is very personable and we felt no pressure in making our choice. The installation of the new garage door was a very smooth operation. I am completely satisfied with his work and am pleased to recommend him.</text>

Nothing beats a good service to start up a good morning! We woke up with a garage door malfunction, we looked for solutions and companies online, took a couple quotes and eventually asked Sam to come and evaluate the damage. Sam came quickly and was able to find the problem causing all the fuss. He also serviced the whole system and left us with a well working garage door, we can recommend Sam full heartedly!< /review>

<text>I had recommended Garage door star many times and have always been impressed with their service. My friend installed his own garage door, but he made a lot of mistakes and the door did not work properly. I called Garage door star and they sent Sam to inspect and give an estimate. Two days later the installer came and had to disassemble the complete installation, and redo it. He also installed a new opener that my friend had bought. All this was done very quickly and at a reasonable cost. Sam and Garage door star are at the top of their game. Very professional. I’m definitely going to recommend them in the future!< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

This company was recommended to me. Sam came to give me an evaluation on installing two new garage doors. Given a fair quote, I decided to go ahead and make it happen. Those doors were replaced the same week! They were most pleasant while doing the job and found the work to be excellent. I highly recommend them.< /review>

<text>Sam was an absolute professional.  When our garage door’s spring broke we called Sam in the morning and he was at our house within the hour and had the spring fixed in no time at a reasonable price. We’ll definitely be giving Sam a call to service our garages in the future.<//text><rate>5< /rate><gmapID>0x80c33174064c3a09:0x761a34d89f033c4f<//gmapID>< UserId.>

Our garage door opener gave up after a long life and service. We searched for garage door repair in our area and came across Garage-door-star which had many good reviews. Later that day Sam came to inspect and give us a quote, we decided to install a new garage door opener that was the same brand as our previous opener, but a newer model. We were satisfied with the costs and service.< /text>

After trying to manipulate my garage door to open and close for about an hour! frustrated, I decided to call the local garage door repair guys at garage door star. Sam came and inspected the issue; the garage door was sitting incorrectly evidently because of the garage door opener wasn’t handing right. Sam was quick to repair the issue and the door works as good as new! Thanks again 😊< /Text>

Sam was great, I’m very pleased with his work. He was able to quickly arrive, he identified the issue and was back in a timely manner to repair and our garage door started working again. He was nice and he provided a great service. The garage was left very tidy.</Review>

Sam was very helpful on the phone and arranged a time to meet. His phone diagnosis proved to be spot on and he had the garage door mounting fixed and the door operating correctly in no time at all. All done in a friendly and professional manner! Recommended!<//text>

We had Sam quote and then install an auto opener on our existing garage door. He arrived on time and did a great job. He is what I would call a true professional in his field. We have an unusual roof so it wasn't a standard install. Thanks Sam.</Review>

<review>I was and am very happy with the service, timing, professional service, and comfortable price which I got from Sam and I highly recommend him.  The other providers whom I met with were major sales pitches with sky high prices noting all type of specific hardships which my job included.  Sam did note the non-standard portions of my garage door installation, but then provided a very nice and fair quote. He changed both of our garage doors and my only wish is that I'd done it years before.  I recommend him highly.</review>< Date>

I can’t say enough good things about Garage Doors star! When our garage door spring broke, they came out early the next day to replace it. They were friendly, professional and respectful and didn’t try to sell us something else that we didn’t need. We really appreciated that! I’d definitely recommend Sam and his company if you need your garage door fixed.</review>

<Text>I damaged my garage door and called Garage Doors Star and the technician Sam came over. It was probably the best choice that I could have made. He fixed my garage door and serviced it. The price was lower than I expected and he provided great service. I would highly recommend him for all of your garage door repairs. I'm a very satisfied customer. When I decide to put in new garage doors, I know who I will be calling. If you want top notch service, you'll do the same.< /Text><pics>None</pics>< response>

After trying many other businesses to help me with my garage door issue, I called garage door Star and for the first time I got a live person on the phone!  Sam accommodated me with a time that would work for me.  He Called in advance and came early.  The repair took about half an hour.  If you are ever in need of garage door repair I highly recommend Sam !<//text>

I have a very old garage... the old heavy door finally died, so I searched local garage door repairs services in my area. I came across a few, called to get quotes, and Sam seemed very knowledgeable on the phone, so I told him to come over when he can. Sam advised of the correct way to install a new door instead of the old one, and the very next day I had a new garage door placed! It’s quite exiting to use the new remote, thank you Sam!< /Text>

<Review>I am SO grateful and appreciative of Sam. It was 10:45 pm and I was calling all over trying to find a way to at least be able to close my garage door for the night, even if it wasn't properly repaired. I called Sam twice and he figured it would probably be urgent if I had called twice, so he called me back. He was about to close, but he was still kind enough to come out and fully repair the door. I honestly don't know what it usually runs to fix a garage door, but I honestly felt that the repair price was reasonable, especially given the late hour. If you need someone I HIGHLY recommend this company.</Review><username>Alyssa Koontz<//username>< response>

Sam came over last weed. He installed our garage door on a new garage. He also installed a manual lock for the door. He did a very nice job . He is polite and thorough, paying attention to fine details. You would not go wrong hiring them for any garage door installations/locks/door openers. I wish them nothing but success in their future business prospects.<//Text>

One evening after a long shift from work, when I arrived home, my overhead garage door was suddenly not opening. I really needed a quick fix because I can’t park on the street. I called Garage Door Star, which was the garage door repair service recommended by my neighbor. Within half an hour, a technician came over and explained to me that my garage door needed spring replacement and he was able to fix it on the spot. He didn’t charge extra for the late hour, I highly recommend this service.</review>

My parents garage door was crooked and rubbing and making a lot of noise so I called Garage Door Star. Sam from Garage Door Star was super fast, fair, nice, and helpful. I highly recommend them for every one that needs a garage door service. My garage door cable snapped at 7am and it garage was fixed by 1pm with the help of Sam the technician. He was efficient, and friendly. Absolutely loved the service I received with Garage Door Star.</Text>

<Text>I called garage doors star repair company and asked if they could check my garage door as it wasn't closing properly and would open and close on its own.  Sam performed his rituals and got rid of the problem with the garage door that was just a headache. He explained the importance or yearly or bi-yearly maintenance being done on garage doors, the other thing he found was the garage door opener was only hanging from the roof by a single loose nut, could’ve been a disaster if he hadn’t noticed!  I would highly recommend Sam and his company!</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Dealing with garage door star was awesome. we called Monday night for an emergency repair cause one of the spring broke and my car was trapped in the garage . the owner Sam showed up quickly gave a few options to repair the door and he was very knowledgeable and answered all of our questions. then he fixed the door right on the spot which was great cause we didn't need to lose work on Tuesday morning. Now we know who to call for our garage door repairs. Thanks.< /Text>

They came urgently within 15 minutes because I had to get my garage to open and they were close by, thankfully we managed to get the faulty garage door to open , they stayed there with my brother to install the new opener which caused the mess, very kind and fast service!<//Review>

Our garage door was making a lot of annoying sounds whenever I closed or opened it. I asked Garage Door Star to send one of their technicians to take a look. Sam, the technician, quickly identified the issue. It was the damaged hinges. He replaced them and the noise was gone in an instant. Thumbs up for that efficient and wonderful garage door repair service. Great job good customer service, 5 stars.<//Text>

<Text>Our garage door opener suddenly stopped working on Christmas! We called Garage door Star in and they came the next day on! Sam was a very pleasant individual. He came on time. He fixed the problem quickly and efficiently, and he gave advice on how to maintain the garage door, and the opener. After he finished he only charged us the very fair price, less than what other similar companies quoted over the phone! Definitely would recommend his services to others with garage door problems.< /Text>< Pics>

Door was up and running in about 30 minutes. He also told me to not hesitate calling anytime 7 days a week if anything. It's always good to have a guy you can relay on in the neighborhood.

Great customer service! Had a problem with my garage door this weekend, I accidentally closed it while pulling the car in, so had a bit of an accident. I called this morning at 8:30. I was surprised that the door was fixed by the afternoon. More than exceeded my expectations! Great work and I would recommend "Garage-Door-Star" if you get in a mess with your garage door.</text>

<Review>The minor closing and opening problems that I had with my garage door were starting to really annoy me, so I searched for local garage door repair services, got a few offers over the phone. Eventually I decided to go with Garage Door Star. The technician arrived a few hours later, checked all the door issues I mentioned, then he located the problem and explained what was causing it. Eventually we solved all the annoying issues, and the door works just like new.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>{'time': 1578420493728, 'text': 'Thank you for your compliment, you are appreciated.'}< /response>< GmapID>

After those high winds last week, my old garage door just gave up and completely collapsed... the same evening I called garage door star and the day after Sam came to put a new door and motor on ! Looks beautiful and will give me piece of mind for years to come :-)

<text>Great service! Been 2 times now. Me and my siblings love this place. Elephants is one I got last year and the script is just a few days ago and i absolutely love them both. The scropt came out exactly like my dads handwriting.. Very friendly and accommodating and nice clean beautiful work. Saving for another visit. Looking forward to something bigger this time.< /text><GmapID>0x80db688f4014dfb1:0xb419906f6fd98410</GmapID><user_name>Nina Roddy< /user_name><user_id>104285118850407978354<//user_id><Date>1597969670009<//Date></record></dataset><record>

Waited 5 hours while people walked in off the street and were taken in before me while I was told to wait. "Wait 30 more minutes".  "Wait 20 more minutes". "I'll take you right after this". It never happened. Extremely unprofessional I'll be sure to let all my friends and family know to avoid this shop. Sam and Danny should be ashamed to clock in everyday knowing full well they will be disappointing paying customers.<//Review></record>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>I genuinely can not believe how kind and welcoming this place was. I grew up around the tattoo scene. Shops/Conventions. But always admire and loved tattoos/piercings and the art from afar, because almost every single encounter I had with tattoo artists was bad. Simply because they were rude. My 18 year old inherited the love for it all just like mom. But I was hesitant to take her in. I didn’t want her to experience the rudeness, at least not her first time. She decided to get a piercing first, we will definitely be back for her tattoo. But,.....
Tasha!! Your amazing babe!!! Thank you so very much for making my Babygirl’s first experience so sweet mama!!! I’m so happy I found your place!!! Thank you Thank you!!!!</Review>< Pictures>

I love this place, my family and I always come back because the staff are so talented and kind, I don’t have a lot of good experiences with piercing/tattoo places but this place is 10/10 for me. Always coming back.< /review>

Took my daughter to get her belly button pierced. The wait was fast. Used all clean piercing needles and the woman who did it was fast and efficient.  It healed up really well.< /Text>

I was having a hard time finding a place to get the tattoo I wanted at a good price. I went to other places finding myself with artists that after crossing the door would barely acknowledge me or would charge me too high for something that even though was time consuming, did not require inner detail at all. When I went to Hidn I felt so welcome by all the artists and as soon as I stated what kind of tattoo I wanted , one of the artists (Matt Duarte) stood up with a lot of excitement to do the tattoo I wanted it at a good price. After that, I knew I was in the right place. I just finished my tattoo today and it was quick , the pain was manageable and more important a perfect final product. Would definitely come back here for my next one ,looking forward for my next tattoo.</Text>

They are very dishonest, they will keep your money and not give it back to you. And it's your money. The excuses are just made my house payment, while your money is making their house payment. Your 2 months behind in yours. This is money on account, no service was done for this money. That means this money was spent and you didn't get services from them. Now I been trying to get it back for some time. The other was had a couple of cancellation. Not my problem! That is dishonest to me and should be to you. If they did it to me, they'll do it to you. I am boycotting their business and hope you do the same. The tattoo person was named Larry Salazar< /Review>

They had a great deal, bring your own design with size restriction. They did an amazing job even though they were extremely busy. My sister in law was offered a free touch up because she was bleeding quite a bit, for safe measure. My tattoo turned put great, Phill did a great job. I will return!!< /Text>< pics>

< Review>
My favorite place.. my go to spot! So easy and simple to figure out what you want. The staffs are very helpful and willing to share their favorites or what they would recommend if you are curious. I also enjoy their goody bags and the price is so worth it! Oh yeah, don’t forget if you rack up your loyalty points it helps out a lot with your purchase.</Review>

I really enjoyed the service at the front desk. The young lady is very nice and the security guard in the front seemed very relaxed and inviting. I enjoy the set up and looks clean

My sister and I have been looking for a place to call home and I think we found it. Boasting a huge catalogue and an inviting interior, this place is amazing. Thank you to the help of Amber and Glenda for giving us great recommendations that we are uber happy with. Keep up the great work!

Update: 5/27 came for the great Thursday deals! They are amazing!< /review>

<text>Absolutely love this place! All the bud tenders know their stuff and are very helpful. They have a great selection and daily deals to help save money. I especially love going on Mondays and Thursdays when you can get 10% off. Last time I went Amy helped me find some dope edibles!< /text>< resp>

<review>First time here. never going back! one: you’re supposed to check-in before getting in line, but they expect you to know that,.. second: instead of letting it be known by the security, he’s over there chopping it up inside. I waited in line for a cool minute and everyone there was confused on to what to do. to either wait in line or what? makes no sense.. they should put that on that messed up little chalkboard they got. people inside were really helpful though</review><response>None</response>< gmapID>

I always enjoy the service I receive here. This review is long overdue. Today I was helped by Amy she was extremely knowledgeable and took the time to educate me on what I was purchasing...which I love!! Their inventory is top notch and I always leave happy! The security at the door is always welcoming as well!< /review>

Always a good experience every time I come here. Great weed, GREAT customer service. I love that they have deals everyday and the “Points” System they have is so cool and super convenient especially if you just keep adding up your points. 10/10 would recommend 👌🏽</Review>

We love this dispensary! They have a great selection of herb, edibles, vapes, and more! They usually have good specials and a nice rewards/loyalty program where you can earn points for future discounts. All of their associates are friendly and always eager to help, especially Destiny who helped us with some great recommendations to take advantage of their sales. 100% recommend this place!< /text>

My go-to shop. The bud tenders are great, the selection is INSANE, and the daily deals have great value (they actually dictate which day of the week I’ll go in). An amazing dispensary! Amber is always on it with recommendations and her knowledge of product!< /Review>

This is great shop with a big selection of everything from vape pens like my favorite,  Raw Garden to a great selection of flower for any price range. Super helpful bud tenders and don't forget the security crew, always good.<//Review>

I absolutely love Show Grow! The budtenders are knowledgeable and kind, very easy to talk to. The store is clean and well lit, the security is polite, the staff checking customers in are great. Buying marijuana and dispensaries can be super intimidating, especially if you grew up with the war on drugs. Anyway. I’ve been coming here for two years, and I will continue to. Thanks SGLB!< /Text>

Enjoyed my first Dispensary experience when traveling to California from the East Coast! Was indecisive and overwhelmed by the huge selection but was helped by a very patient budtender named Dalena! She was extremely informative and made sure I got the flower best suited for me.< /review>

Stopped in today to pick up a few pre-rolls and Amber was my bud tender. She went above and beyond what I expected, taking her time to explain in great detail the differences between strains, and terpene profiles. Great shop, good prices and spotlessly clean.

Love the place and love the selection! Great buds and great edibles! My budtender, Alex, helped so much in choosing the right edibles for a person who cannot stand the taste of some edibles<//Text>

<Text>Went in for the first time because they looked like they had a good selection of CBD products for my neck and back pain.

They were offering a CBD roll on product that is new to the store and the bud tender recommended it based on her manager’s review. Went home and tried the product several times throughout the day only to find it made my pain worse and didn’t provide any pain relief. I actually feel even more sore today.

I understand it’s not customary to allow exchanges and refunds, HOWEVER, this is a new product they just started selling and I feel it’s only fair to allow a one time exchange for another one of their products (obviously I’d pay any difference). I have the product and the receipt and purchased it less than 24 hours ago. The only response I got was that the manager said it worked and they’re sorry I had a different experience.

If it’s a new product and it didn’t work for me why wouldn’t they pay me the courtesy of a one time exchange to keep my business? I mean.. I know I’m only one person but customer service goes a long way. The receipt and product said nothing about exchanges. Now I’m stuck with a product that doesn’t work and was a waste of my money.</Text><pics>None</pics><Resp>{'time': 1613757918332, 'text': 'Bianca, we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience your recent experience at our dispensary may have caused.

< Review>
Always friendly and helpful from the security guard out front to all the budtenders inside.

Great variety and quality from here every visit.

My fav part? The loyalty system that allows you to earn points on every purchase. Before you know it you have enough to make a trip free lol.

Edit: was sold vape pods that dont work without a special vape. Came back to store with receipt and pods but manager couldnt exchange them since they left store.

But manager gave me a discount on the special vape and i was able to use my loyalty points to purchase it and spent on 56 cents outta pocket lol. ✊🏾</Review>

<Text>I love this place. They always have the top notch flower, concentrates, and edibles. The Budtender Amy is very knowledgeable about the products there. I don't smoke too often, but I do eat edibles often. She introduced me to some thc capsules that work very well for me. She also was able to teach me some of the differences between the strands and what strands can help different ailments. Overall, this is probably the best dispensary I've been to in all of LA county.<//Text>< pics>

I love this place! Its clean and the staff is organized. I would recommend this place if you want your monies worth. They have deals and a point system. They carry a variety of brands like Pacific Stone, Select Elite and Space Coyote. The next door down is a smoke shop so its a one stop shopping center for your paraphernalia needs.< /text>

The young lady  whose name is Glenda was my budtender. She is so very nice and helpful. Glenda is the person who help's me in picking strains that would be good for me. I'm on SSI and My income is limited and Glenda helps me to get the best for my money. She is very nice, knowledgeable, and helpful....I recommend this dispensary to all my friends.

I throughly enjoy every visit to this shop! They always have my favorite brands in stock like Jeeters. It’s always clean here and I never wait too long to get helped (even with covid restrictions).
I want to give a shout out to Kat who I always happen to see there! She’s super sweet and always has cool recommendations for when I feel adventurous. I can tell she truly enjoys her job because she makes me feel like I can ask any dumb questions on my mind :). I would know because I am a server myself so I can tell the difference between fake nice and real nice!</review>

<rate>1<//rate><review>Couple times now, the price online when you place for pickup (including taxes)and the price at checkout are different. Mobile orders dont really save the time you'd think. Couple of the ladies always have an attitude, but I'm not very social, so it could be a me thing. I usually buy a half once or twice a month. This place used to be different.
Honestly I'm just looking for a new shop, parking sucks here.

Edit. This would be including taxes... it doesn't happen every visit. Either way, if the price it shows me at checkout to place an order for pickup is different from the price I actually pay when I pick up. Somethings wrong with the site.
And now that you mention it, I actually remember having to wait In line to pickup my order with regular walk ins, on multiple occasions.<//review>< Pictures>

The service is fantastic and the products are reasonably priced. I am from out of town, so I had lots of questions and wanted to get the right things and they were very helpful. This dispensary has everything that the other dispensaries in LGB have, but Show Grow seems to be much less expensive. GREAT DAILY DEALS—see pics!</Text>< pictures>

Came here for the first time and I had the best experience.. I have been going to other dispensaries and find myself getting anxiety when I walk in.. Showgrow was not like this at all from the very friendly staff in the front to the amazing bud tender Destiny that absolutely made me feel at home she was extremely informative and helpful Destiny knows her Stuff!  They also had all the products that I need.. She also informed me that if a product like a cart was damaged we have 3 days to return it.  So guys if you are looking for great products and exceptional customer service please go see my new friends at ShowGrow in Long beach. Thanks guys!  I'll be a regular😊<//review>

I returned today armed with a little more knowledge but again ran into a similar situation due to some financial complications. Luckily I got the same tender and he remembered my plight from the previous day and did his best to alleviate the situation.

The staff also seemed to be a lot more forthcoming with certain policy's and things to watch out for and how to properly navigate the system they have in place. Thanks guys, will be back in tomorrow to claim that free gram. 3rd times a charm.< /Review><user>100752759013201122976</user>< Rating>

< review>
I ordered this online, the picture and description are very clear. A pack of 5 pre rolls for $18.16. When I got there I discovered it was false advertisement!!!! The manager kept instead that this price was 45 and that he couldn't do anything about. They shouldnt have products listed with the wrong prices! You cant trust the prices nor description of products when ordering online.

Update: I try this place out once again and I had a bad experience. I placed an online order went to pick it up. Upon my arrival I saw prerolls that were not on the online menu. So I asked if I could add some to my order, but apparently you are NOT allowed to make changes to an online order. Seriously this is beyond bad management!!! I just wanted to add 3 more iteams to my order and I was denied.<//review>

We do not allow adjustments to express pick-up orders to be fair to our guests waiting in our "walk-in" line. If we allowed adjustments to express pick-up orders, it would no longer be considered an express pick-up, due to the simple fact that guests waiting in line would be waiting for you to shop. We offer express pick-up services to our guests to expedite the duration of your visit so you can skip the line and avoid waiting for service. We service our express pick-up customers prior to our walk-in customers because they have already requested the products they are intending to pick-up.

Incredibly friendly and helpful staff, quick service unless it's a big sale rush, and fantastic product variety. The rewards program is far and away the best of any dispensary I've been to, and the frequent sales are varied and always great bargains. Couldn't ask for a better dispensary within walking distance of my house! For those who prefer vapes for cost/volume efficiency, Rove is a great brand to try. Live Farms is also good, Select is great if you have the cash to spare.< /Review>

This is an organized nicely run dispensary.  Loved the deal on getting a rec and a $39 credit to check out their product line.  If you're into quality product, they carry the names you want.  Be advised that tax is not included with the menu prices but in the end I feel they're consistent with what others are charging.  You'll be treated with respect.  Everyone is kind and helpful.<//Text>

Went in to ShowGrow(all the way from Catalina island) and bought 3gs of wax and a cartridge thinking I would get the first time patient discount on the wax but the bud tender put it on the cartridge! So my total was $160 instead of $120 .. if you go in make sure you tell them ahead of time what you want discounted. Which is weird.. why wouldn’t you discount the more expensive items and only discount one.. my mistake I guess.< /Text>

So in Weedmaps they advertise a special for Wednesday on select vape cartridges as a 2 for 1 on select brands. I went ahead and placed my order through their app, and at checkout the discounts were not reflected. I went ahead and called the store to confirm the prices and was told they would be adjusted at the store. I arrived at the store and despite have preordered a still had a lengthy wait. Finally got into the store and the people working there have no knowledge of the special. They tried to tell me it was a buy a gram get a 1/2 gram. Clearly that’s not a 2 for 1 as indicated. All of this inability to honor their prices took about 10 minutes. At that point they still had no plans of honoring their advertised special. I went ahead and left without a purchase. A complete waste of time.< /text>

Kat and Diana Elizabeth are my favorite bud tenders there! They both provide excellent customer service skills! When I see either of the two working it makes my day because i know I’ll have a good experience. I love the promotions and deals the offer frequently and I love the point and rewards system. Also you Can’t go wrong with a $5 pre roll. :)<//review>

<review>Just let a review over on Weedmaps. I've been in Southern California Cannabis for quite some time and the lack of knowledge in that shop is disparaging. I was eager to talk and discuss the 'budtenders' knowledge but they were more focused on making money, getting me to do their 'deal' and in order to do so the bud tenders lied about product they didn't know about. I unfortunately had to tell my nephew how they treated me and although he kind of liked this place now doesn't seem excited to return either.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

Store has great potential.  It could improve greatly by freshening up their bud supply.  Their samples were stale as was the $35 1/8 I purchased.  MAKE SURE YOU CHECK THE PACKAGE DATE ON YOUR BUDS, MY BUDS WERE PACKAGED IN JUNE AND I BOUGHT THEM IN DECEMBER.   I bought some other buds that were packaged in  November and they were just fine.</Text>

Your site says you carry it.", she said "what are you talking about?" I literally gave her the brand name, the product I was looking for and the gram amount. Like be more UNhelpful dummy!

< Review>
The upside:

- Super nice dispensary & staff! Every employee I've encountered has been friendly and helpful.

- Ordering through the app is convenient and you can also pick out rewards via their points program (based on how much money you spend).

---

The downfall:

- After overhearing the staff talking to each other about tips and how some staff know how to get more tips I feel super weird about going in now like I'm obligated to tip. Honestly, though...

1. Tipping is good karma but if you're literally putting pre-packaged items in a bag I don't find that a reason to tip. I don't tip baggers at the grocery store but maybe I should?

2. Now when I go pick up orders and get change I feel like I'm being watched like a hawk and it makes me so uncomfortable. I'm probably being hyper aware but it's a bummer because I really did like this spot.

- After placing an order through the app you get a text about 2 1/2 hours later asking if you're coming to pick it up. I assume this is a way to keep track of possible sales for the day but it's annoying.

- The parking lot is tight. There are two designated spots to the right of the dispensary that make a huge difference!< /Review>

<Text>This is one of my favorite shops. However, I hate when Bree pulls up my name. I asked her the name of the preroll that was buy one, get one for $1 on Green Friday. She rudely said she didn’t know, that it might had been. I couldn’t believe she’s the manager and didn’t know the sales! My partner and I also had to correct her on how strong three of the prerolls are. She got each one way off. It’s as if she literally doesn’t give a f*ck, and everyone and everything is beneath her. This would be my favorite shop, if Bree wasn’t there. But now I’ll pay more, just to avoid her. The rest of the crew are awesome!< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Their managers made me cry. They would not honor a pre roll THEY forgot to give ME. I didn't even want to come back and ask for it because I already have very high anxiety and not only did they not give me what they forgot, as I walked out I began to cry out of embarrassment. I had to wait to write this because I am that anxious about the whole situation. This is not how employees and managers should treat nice customers. You should be ashamed.< /review>

< Review>
Purchased a vape Delta 9 battery, 4 months later died. Called store and was told they only carry one Delta 9 product, they never offered to call the vendor for me. Was told to call them myself and figure it out. A good business would have taken my number down and called the vendor and set up an exchange or service with the vendor. Bottom line, POOR customer service. Thanks God I tipped $20 every time I went in! WTF Never doing business with them...< /Review>

The security guard is honestly the best really great guy. The managers are always respectful and undestading. Can’t say enough about the store. Also they have a reward system a fun claw game to win points for future purchases.

Show Grow Long Beach has the best budtenders in the business. I have visited other local dispensaries and nothing compared. Not only are the prices competitive,  but the variety of products that they carry will surely please any green consumer. The management team is always friendly and very knowledgeable about the products and proper uses for them; they always recommend the best products. I can go on forever, just GO TO SHOWGROW!!!!</text>

<Review>IN theory this shop should rock. check your receipt carefully. While they are being soooo cool when helping you and acting like you are getting such a deal they are ripping you off. Charging sale tax , no giving promised reductions etc. Of course OC weekly gave them great reviews. They knew who they were when they came in. Place is giving weed shops a gangster vibe. Never again.<//Review>< pictures>

I've been to this place countless of times now and while theres definitely a postive vibe in the shop; it feels like a lot of things in the world: overpriced and overated.
Each time I come here I'm disappointed that this shop (while down the street from my house) never has what I want at a reasonable price. An eigth should never cost more than 50 bucks for any reason. And you should always have $5 and $6 Pre Rolls in stock. I completely understand why as the manager informed me on one of my trips but when you got the Green Room in LBC, why go here? Wish I could leave a better review peeps but I gotta be honest about 2018's Best Dispensary (that's legit). I'll visit soon though. I wish you all a beneficial weeked.<//review>

<Text>Came in last night with my sister, it was her first time here at Showgrow and Neona was more than friendly, she was able to make my sister feel welcome and also explained the difference between indica and sativa. They both shared laughs, it was nice to see my sister treated so kindly, she has terrible anxiety at times and this was a breath of fresh air. Neona is the best! Thanks a million!! Definitely coming back, the selection is always the best I've seen in long beach.</Text></record></dataset><record>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>YUP! WELCOME TO LONG BEACH!!! They had their sign up for awhile, i guess due to construction, so I'd always come by to check it out but finally it's open!!! The inside is super nice, actually probably the nicest shop I've seen. The lobby is small and  it's not adult use yet but I've always wondered why the heck places have huge lobbies. Theirs is all glass and they have this super huge beautiful sign that is their logo lit up. It's the picture I'm uploading with this post. Anyways, most importantly, the weed here is fire! Like a kid in a candy store, i love dispensaries. Showgrow must have had probably 500 cannabis products inside.</Review>< pics>

ShowGrow is the first dispensary to assist me with pain management. I have experienced gradually worsening arthritic pain for the last year. Showgrow carries a wide variety cbd oil for pain. All the staff was very helpful and Assistant Manager Caylie recommended a 1:1 concentrated CBD and THC oil. I have been using 2 drops morning and evening for one week. The results have been pretty dramatic. Hand and spinal pain is minimal now. Great shop and fantastic helpful staff.< /text>

<Review>First time here and I asked for a hybrid indica dominant strain like the Los Angeles Kush LA Honor I had and I can’t believe it that my budtender recommended me Tyson Farm Jacks Cookie N Cream. That strain smells so strong like Jack Herrer, so I ask is she sure it’s heavy out of the other strains that I had asked to compare to like the Korova Pie Hoe and Bubonic Thin Mint but she reassured me that Jacks Cookie N Cream is heavy. But when I first smoked a joint of it last night and all I feel was in my head. I don’t feel no body high and this strain got me the jitters and tingles through my body, fingers and toe. I told my budtender that I can’t do sativa because that’s what I go through and I don’t like it. Don’t get me wrong this place do have some good flowers but it’s just this issue that I got. I hope management can do something about it. I’m just down the street and you know there are other dispensary near by but I just want to make this my go to shop. Oh and hands down to Ivan.</Review>< pictures>

twice i tried to place my order online as they indicate i can, however after i waste my time picking out what i need i press order and it loops me back around like i did nothing and have to start over only to have the same thing happen again. im trying to give u guys money, theres too much competition out there to lose customers over mistakes and lack of attention to the proper operation of ur website..  weeks prior to this incident i attempted to visit this location but had a question first, and i couldnt get a response of any sort from any form of contact in a timely manner, i was contacted the following evening but well over 24 hours to simply answer if they had a product.  this is a shame, i would have been a valuable customer and i make frequent large purchases and now im giving up on showgrow because twice failed is 2 times too many<//text>

<review>Have gone to for years. No more. They seem to never have the pre roll (Indica/jeeter) that normally buy. Today, again no. "We ran out", is getting old. They advertised a 2 for one Lowell pre-rolls. I asked for that, we're out. What??? It's only noon! Your advertising something you don't have ???... hmmm.
Way to much competition out there. Shame on you new(?) owners.< /review><GmapID>0x80dd3198a1de1d41:0xdc334df0480e40e8</GmapID><resp>{'time': 1534120514191, 'text': "Dianne, we're sorry for products being out of stock on your last visit.

<review>I writing this review because I called to complain and I was told to go to yelp and write a review.  It is time for me to get my CBD oil and Wednesday at 2:09pm I received a text Surprise FLASH SALE (show this text ) buy 1 &get 1 free on all products.  Now through Saturday SHOWGROW LB. I went on line a picked out a few things I wanted to get. I went in Friday to pick up the CBD oil and a sexy oil.  To my surprise they did not have my oil I was going to get another kind with thc. When I presented my text  I was told it was only for certain products I showed where the text said all products and I was told that was not true it was not for all items she pointed to a basket of items. The original items that I wanted won’t be there until 7/1. Had I known there wasn’t a sale on my product I would not have made the trip.  I don’t appreciate the false advertising😡😡😡😡😡< /review>< Rating>

Thanks Lynda"}<//resp><Review>I wanted to buy medical cbd oil products here.  It is legal and I shouldn't need a new medical card. My letter is expired but no longer required in (orange county anywY). They wanted to sell me a medical card for $39 in order to purchase medical CBD products. The reason is "they are waiting for their recreational licensing to come thru." I'm not purchasing recreational product so why should I be unable to purchase cbd oil. Not logical. They are selling bud already...if you buy a card from them
So wrong.<//Review></record>
