BEWARE of a recruiter by the name of Farrell Pompa! She sent me to a client location, and lied about being provided with the necessary equipment needed to perform the job task. 2 weeks in, and I still didn't have the proper equipment stated during the hiring process. She didn't even tell me about the client giving us a day off, after I spent 1 1/2 hours driving to the location. And STILL 4 YEARS LATER! I'm  being penalized for it. Whatever she wrote in my candidate file, is preventing me from getting a job from any aerotek. After COVID, and many clients needing workers, you would think that they would try to staff as many people as they can. After multiple calls, and interviews, I still have to explain myself for what she wrote in my file. I wonder what would the California EDD office have to say about Aerotek denying people jobs, when they are willing/able to work. DISGRACEFUL!<//review>

< Review>
I agree with Intidada's review...this staffing agency does not care about employees and they aren't a good resource for medical office work. My recruiter actually lied to me about a job. It was supposed to be a 6 month contract working remotely, when in fact it was only 2 months remote and the commute was very long from where I live. When I called her out on it she dropped me as an applicant. Before that she had threatened to CANCEL an interview when I criticized the way things were being handled. Also, it is nearly impossibly to contact many of their field offices.<//Review>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Text>They care more about their contracts than they do the Employees, when an Employee is treated unfairly they rather remove the Employee than correct the situation so they don’t loose the contract, sad but true, Employees are nothing but a number to them.

I heard that their top recruiter even said to one of the shift leads whoever wanted to get unemployment let me know SO WE CAN FINISH THEM.

I laughed at that because unemployment is a worker’s right to get if he becomes unemployed.

They really need to check their main top recruiter.</Text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80c2caa9234ba853:0xe5843ec6725da6d9<//Gmap_id></record>

these guys have to be the worst agency in history. twice i have worked for them. and twice they have placed me at underneath the barrel companies. stop working with startups! they are STARTUPS! they have absolutely no idea what they are doing! you are wasting good talent by throwing people under the bus! they dont return emails they dont return calls. anyone looking to break into the aerospace industry, please. dont accept any positions with these people. you will get thrown on third shift somewhere in the desert for 15$ an hour 7 days a week.< /Text>

The recruiters of this company would like to just get your resume and have all your references to ask/search about you but nothing happens after all. No job interview, No job open position to be offered to you. JUST WASTING YOUR TIME AND YOUR REFERENCES. Also, they do not answer your follow up emails and phones after a while.< /review>

<date>1580540041939</date><rating>5< /rating><review>I worked for Aerotek going on 3 years, my first recruiter working out of Aerotek in City of Industry, placed me at a company called Ceilings Plus.  My recruiter's name for that location was Aileen a young lady who's a very caring individual, with anybody she dealt with. I personally believe she will go a long way in this life.
One month later I was placed at Principal Plastics a small family-owned business in Gardena, California by Araceli Delgadillo of Aerotek of Torrance. Being a principal Plastics was another story, there were three employees there of my own Mexican race who were probably the ones responsible for giving the name treachery its meaning! Now don't get me wrong, I never said these three were lazy they worked hard,  we just didn't get along.
And the majority of employees at Principle Plastics were excellent people especially the seamstress Dept. And so were the men & women of shipping, who were led by two supervisors of high quality, one of them is Blanca.
And last but definitely not the least my boss; Ramon very good man, like myself ex-army. So mellow I could not have ever imagined him ever being a drill sergeant & actually I don't know if he ever was.
I wonder how Luna is doing talk about a beautiful dog and as mellow as her master.
Truth be told I do miss this place very much, and I thank Aerotek Torrance for my experience there.
Once leaving Aerotek I went back to work for Dov Charney La Apparel formally American Apparel after 3 days of being there Ernie a supervisor for maintenance cause me to get (breaking my scapula) hurt. Preparation for my surgery is now underway but when I heal I plan to go back to Aerotek, the men & women staffing Aerotek are of excellent quality and they live and work by their moto; there people are everything!< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

You're just another number to them. I was placed on a temp assignment that displayed gross favoritism and extremely poor management and when I asked for assistance in reassignment, they directed me to the Aerotek website to search for jobs on my own. They simply didn't care and you can never get anyone on the phone. Had to call for  hours to get a single recruiter on the line. A horrible mess of an agency.< /review>

After i requested a raise, took about a month to see it.  I tried calling the phone will ring for ever.  Have been calling for about a week and NO ONE will pick up.  Not only that but 5 of the employees that i used to stay in contact refuse to respond to my emails and calls after the raise.  Most unprofessional consulting firm to work for!  Don't even try.  They will make 100% on top of you (for processing your payroll which is mostly computerized and that's all!!!), stiff the client with an exorbitant bill and refuse to answer you after you negotiate a raise which takes ALOT of effort!
I will be making complaints on LinkedIn, GlassDoors, Indeed and other websites regarding this company's unprofessional,  unethical, nefarious  behavior.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

They called me offered me a job . They just told me they will call me back. It's been a week and I said no to other job offers because the one this company offered was better and better pay. But never did they email me or call me or anything . I had to call 2 days later. And the same thing . Never called me back. They dont care if they help u get a job . If they dont call and send u to work that same day dont expect anything from them . I worked for this company before and it took almost 3 weeks to get paid by them. They never return emails . And just forward calls around and laugh about it</Review>

I went in to apply and fill out the application. They said that I would get a call within a few days. That was on dec.17th. They have not called and they clearly don't want to get you a job. I'd recommend labor ready, where they actually want you to work.</Review>

<text>My family orders honeybaked ham yearly it’s a tradition. We love the flavor of the ham and the glaze on top is delicious and tasty. I wish I knew about new curb side pick up they offer, it could have saved me time. I arrived at 9:00 am this morning and waited 45 minutes in line and only showed up at that time because I wanted to be early but online they have store hours posted but they are wrong and need to updated to reflect that they open early during the holidays apparently the store opens at 7:00 am during the holidays wish I had known that before hand.< /text><pics>None<//pics><Response>{'time': 1606233863488, 'text': 'Thanks for the great review C and for letting us know about the hours being incorrect. We will work to update those ASAP. Thanks again for your support, especially during this time. We appreciate you and hope you have a wonderful Thanksgiving.'}< /Response>< gmap_id>

This year, our Plague year, I thought the taste and ritual of a Honey Baked ham at Easter (even though my family is tiny) would be comforting. The comfort is ongoing: in the weeks after we ate ham on fresh bagels like teenagers; I made split pea soup with a large ham bone; one small end remains for my mother’s fifteen bean soup this coming week.
I was and am deeply grateful that in our New World there remain some Old World pleasures! Thank you Honey Baked team for keeping up the good work of feeding our families.< /text><name>Kathleen Bonann Marshall< /name>< pics>

The honey crust around the outside of the ham was burnt black.  The first 2 inches of the ham was dry and inedible.  When I emailed the company about this situation after Thanksgiving, I received no response.<//Text>

This place is a well oiled machine!  Once you walk in (only one way in), a very nice employee hands you a  sample of ham then guides you around the corner to the ordering line. Once it's your turn, all you have to do is let the cashier know what you want. Everything is labeled on the refrigerator doors behind them. After they box/wrap everything up for you, they will even help you to your vehicle.  All the food is excellent and just the right amount.  We'll definitely order again.<//Text>

It was amazing there were samples and the food tasted amazing definitely is a favorite the honey turkey was amazing even tho I don't like turkey that much. The turkey was originally 19.99 but we got a bigger ham (we had a 7.45 pond ham) and for making it 8 pounds they made the turkey 6 dollars cheaper it was a amazing place definitely recommend it.</Text>

The process even though there was a line was ok. It didn't matter if you had a reservation or not you stood in the same line so what's the point of getting a reservation? Because it is Thanksgiving I had my grand daughter with me. She is only 7 and needed the restroom. There restroom was closed and when I ask if we could use it I was told no. Unfortunately I had to get out of line and go to the Walgreens and then get back in line. If this is a business and we were a buying patron the restrooms should be available!!! That is really unacceptable!!!!!!< /review>

<date>1546099638203</date><rate>2<//rate><review>The Honey Baked Ham Company  in Fresno was a complete mess. The store was so unorganized. There was products EVERYWHERE and out of place. It was like a 5 year old kid just placed the products randomly on the tables.The 35 minute wait in line was not worth the ham. The glaze wasn't even on the ham. When we opened the ham the glaze was suck to the gold foil, which was pointless because you are not able to wrap the ham back up in the foil. The price is ridiculous for the quality I received. The store was dirty. The floors where messy and needed to be swepted and mopped.  The staff were not friendly and seemed to care more about what their coworkers plans were that Friday night then to care about seeing the paying customers where helped in a timely manner or that the store was presentable.< /review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Love the hams, expected the lines, but grossed out by the unattended food samples sitting all around. Kids touching them, soiled napkins on counter. Yuk. Better not to have them.< /text>

I have driven by this place several times and always said I needed to stop for lunch.  The service is excellent and of course the treats are great very generous portions.  As should be expected the ham sandwiches are the bomb and the spreads are a delight< /Text>

<Review>Overpriced for the quality of ham. Used to be better.  Had a coupon good for a half ham but had to buy a 9 pound ham because they said there was a minimum weight too. Not going back again.< /Review>< date>

The ham was good but after a one hour wait to purchase it and watching several individuals just go in and come out without having to stand in a line for an entire hour, I really don't think l will be doing that again.<//review>

Really crappy service.  People are rude. They don't take the next in line even if you have a reservation. You better have your reservation number or go to the back of the line until you find out.  Never again! Not worth it!</text>

Delicious Ham and sides, but make sure your method of payment has your name on it and not that of a parent. They will not accept payment when attempting to purchase a ham for a parent with their card.</text>

Went to pickup a ham our kids ordered for us for Thanksgiving. The line was loooong! And even though ours was already reserved there was just one line; I thought there would be a separate line for reservations. It was chaos.< /review>

Horrible!!! We reserved a feast meal for Thanksgiving and we get there to pick up and they said we sold out! We told them that's why we reserved!!! Nothing they could do. This is ridiculous! Never going again.< /Text>

Didn't expect it but, Tonir Cafe was truly awesome. I have absolutely no complaints fair prices, absolutely worth for what you get. Pretty much every menu item that we have ordered was very fresh and yummy. The employees made sure I was helped and answered all my questions really politely and swiftly. I'll definitely be returning in the near future.< /review>

<text>It's got the air of a hole in the wall restaurant from the outside, but do not judge them by the exterior. it really does have the best Mediterranean food in the area. They have a vegetarian plate which is really just the sides grouped together as a single plate, so my vegetarian friends weren't overly impressed, but I love the lule, the kabobs, and the sides are super flavorful even if not filling by themselves. The salmon also got high marks from my friend. The prices are reasonable too.

It's in an industrial area where there aren't many comparable options nearby and the locals like this place so be prepared. If you get there at noon, you should get a table without too much trouble. Get there at 12:30 though and you might have to wait.< /text>< pictures>

I love this place. Really good food and made quickly. Employees are very nice and thoughtful. You can order online, phone or just show up. Good amount of parking out front and lots of tables inside. I usually get the plates which come with two sides and on real hungry days add some extra protein.< /Text>

This place it's great.  Unassuming from the outside but quite popular and busy inside. Authentic Armenian flavors and dishes.  The salmon was cooked perfectly.  The baby back ribs were cut, cooked, seasoned,  and sauced to perfection. Can't wait till I'm back there again. Was welcomed in by the staff immediately. Even with all the to-go orders, the food came out in a reasonable amount of time.< /Text>

The servings are generous and the meat is delicious.  They tend to get pretty busy and do a lot of takeout business so sometimes the servers are pretty busy and can't get to you right away.

Truly a hidden gem of a restaurant in Burbank.<//text>< pics>

Mediterranean / Armenian food in a no frills environment. The meat is cooked well and attention is paid to the rice and sides. Great local workday lunch option if in the mood for kebabs. Parking is street parking but ample. But it should be understood that although the restaurant is clean and the service is prompt,  the ambience is no frills.</Text>

< review>
This little hideaway gem is a great place for some amazing Armenian food. Everything is cooked to perfections and great presentation. The staff is very friendly and provide wonderful service. Tends to get really busy during lunch hour, so try to get there a bit earlier if you want to have sit down lunch.<//review>

A friend and I tried this little out-of-the way restaurant for dinner, mext to a marine repair shop. An add place for a restaurant, I thought. It was deserted the evening we went... not another customer in sight. Too bad, because the food was very good. While service was a little slow, the grape leaves, and chicken kabobs were delicious and the portions were generous. We also loved the eggplant caviar-- it was fresh-tasting and served cold, but with the great pita bread, it was very satisfying and a perfect start to the meal. The only downside comment I have is that the Greek salad was pretty standard and nothing special.</text>

A hidden gem of a restaurant which serves Mediterranean food. My favorite thing to order here are the kebabs! When you order food, you are offered side dishes that come with the order. I usually get hummus and  pita.
The service are very friendly and accommodating. You feel that warmth of eating at a home-feel restaurant. I have made return visits with friends and co-workers.</Review>

I cannot say enough good things about this quaint little hole in the wall.  The food is outstanding!!!  I eat here on a weekly basis.  It is a hidden gem.  Everything I have tried is fantastic.  I usually get the greek chicken salad or the chicken breast kabob plate.
The fries are really scrumptious.  Surprising that they have fries, but they are truly really good.

I love that I can call ahead and place my order and it is ready within minutes of my arrival.  They do tons of delivery and take out.
Drive by slow to find the place, it's an unassuming storefront.  I highly recommend if you like Mediterranean.</review>

I ordered from grubhub for myself and co workers. I've heard from others that, they have outstanding food so I thought I would try it out. I ordered and the estimated delivery time said about an hour, I wasn't too happy about but they surprised me by showing up within 20 minutes of placing my order!!

Definitely true about having outstanding food. A hole in the wall place. I plan on going back to them and ordering for work.<//Text>

Most delicious, healthy and fresh tasting mediterranean food I’ve found in LA. Relaxed atmosphere and a great family owned feel. Chicken Kabob with Grilled peppers and french fries is my favorite. Make sure to order extra garlic sauce!< /text>

<Text>From my travels around the world and coast to coast with east coast being home. Tonir is most authentic Armenian food I have experienced outside of Armenia. The outside doesn’t do the restaurant justice but the interior far surpasses the facad and the food is absolutely amazing. Will come back over and over. Thank you Tonir for being the most true and Authentic Armenian cuisine.< /Text>< pics>

Oddly situated restaurant in the middle of an industrial area in Burbank. You'd easily drive by this place without a second thought. The interior is relatively spare but seats more than you'd expect.

I ordered to go and the beef in the beef salad was still tender and juicy even after sitting in the to-go box for an hour. The ikra was one of the better ones I've had. I'm not sure why it's universally called eggplant caviar because there's no caviar nor eggs for that matter. The Armenian coffee was strong without a huge amount of sludge.

Parking is plentiful on the other side of the street with diagonal stalls set along the entire street.<//Text>

Great spot! It's my new go-to before or after a flight out of Burbank--the airport is literally a 3 minute drive.

The food is fantastic. A heaping plate of two pieces of flavorful lule kebab on rice plus two samplings of their appetizers (love the smoky eggplant dip and tzatziki-like yogurt dip) and pita will set you back $6.75. A sprinkling of sumac seals the deal.

The place is a local, family-owned restaurant with friendly and attentive waitstaff. They have beers on tap and apparently live music on Saturdays to keep things festive. Looking forward to returning again and again.< /Text>

<review>Hubby and I were in town for a meeting. After we checked out of the hotel I needed to kill some time and was hungry. Decided to see if I could have Greek food delivered to parking lot. Lol..after all this is SoCal right? I ordered via grubhub, 20 minutes later my parrot (in the car too) were grubbing on yummy yogurt and cucumber, lamb chops and hummus and pita bread.

<pics>None< /pics><Name>Gevork Asatryan<//Name><review>Could have received the 5th star if there was more value in the meal. I bought the Chicken and Beef Shish combo plate and only got 4 pieces of beef when I should've been given 5.
Aside from missing that piece of beef I was also given maybe 2 spoonfuls of Tabule. You'd expect a fuller plate as the partition on the plate could've easily held at least 4 times the amount given. Especially when I look at some of the photos posted by other Yelpers, seems like they received a lot more than I did.

As far as the quality and taste of the food, I can't complain. Definitely delicious, but you could get so much more and just as good, if not better, at Zankou Chicken paying a few dollars less. I don't nickel and dime, but in terms of value (and a missing piece of beef) for a first timer, I had to rate this a 4 star.</review>< response>

This place has horrible service. I ordered three plates for delivery at 12pm and they did not start preparing the food until 1pm, so my food did not arrive until 1:30pm. I called and asked why they were taking so long and they gave me a really bad attitude like if it was my fault for ordering from their restaurant! If you read all this, please know this place is not worth it at all, save your money and go eat at any other place.< /text>

< Review>
Aaron is great to work with! He and his staff have always responded quickly to my questions and concerns. When I’ve had life changes (new car, new house, husband passing away, elderly mom moving in, etc) he’s been great about getting all he needs to know about the situation and presents me with insurance options that best meets my needs, and with great rates! He was also able to help a friend after her homeowners policy was recently canceled.  I highly recommend this agency – I’ve been with them for many years and have been very happy with their service!<//Review>

I don’t even know where to start with how helpful Bridgett has been with any of my cars over the past years.

Lemme just keep it short and sweet. Absolutely on point and so attentive without any hesitation & with the greatest attitude.

She earned a life long customer.</Text>

Every interaction, regardless of who answers the phone or responds to emails, has been handled professionally, promptly and with personalized attention. I appreciate that we’re not simply an account number when calling an 800#. The regular review of our policies gives us peace of mind that we have the right amount of coverage.

<pictures>None<//pictures><Review>I have been with State Farm, this particular office in Campbell, for 30 years. They are nothing short of amazing. Everyone is top notch!! If I ever had a claim, they were on it with lightning speed. And super helpful! No waiting on hold or waiting for a return call. I HIGHLY suggest that you switch your current insurance to this office. Or if you're looking for insurance, look no further. A huge shout-out to Beth in this office for all her incredible work.< /Review>< Time>

I wish everyone would conduct business the way Bridget and Aaron Sessions have for me. They've been my insurance company for over 11 years now and have made every contact pleasant and simple. They've helped me through homeowners insurance, multiple automobile policies and personal liability insurance. Bridget has been more than accommodating, has promptly answered all of my questions (there have been a lot) and gotten back to me with lightning speed anytime I've ever needed anything.
Aaron has gone out of his way multiple times to explain in layman's terms what I should have in terms of coverage and why. I really can't say enough about how great this particular office is. I'm lucky to have been introduced to them years ago.<//Text>

Aaron Sessions is the BEST insurance company you can find. Always in contact when needed. When we had to evacuate our home due to California wildfires, they proactively reached out to us to see if we were OK and see if we needed anything. ABOVE AND BEYOND!!!  Use. Then with comfort. Great folks!< /Text>

The team at Aaron Sessions are fantastic!! I have been working out of state for the last 11 months and every time I have needed them they are right there. I have been a Statefarm customer for more years then I can remember. When my previous agent Gary retired I found my self on Aaron’s doorstep and I couldn’t be happier.

Thanks for everything!!!</Text>

<Review>I've been with State Farm for over 10 years. When we moved to Campbell, I switched my agent over to Aaron Sessions and his team (Bridget, Beth, Krista, ...). They are all extremely knowledgeable, professional and proactive -- always reaching out over the phone for annual payment reminders, suggestions for lower rates and so on. If they need a moment to double check policies on RV rentals, they will do so and get back to me right away.

On the couple of occasions where we've needed to make claims, they are always easy to get to, working with claim adjusters and repair shops to get us what we need promptly.

I highly recommend these folks for their thorough commitment, integrity and overall awesomeness!<//Review><response>None</response><Rating>5<//Rating></record>

I have been with State Farm a long time and have had several other agents before Aaron Sessions and I’ve always been happy with the service. Aaron took over when my previous agent left and I can say without a doubt him and his team take care of me just as well as the previous if not better.<//text>

I switched to State Farm over 5 years ago because of a bad experience with Progressive. I was looking for an insurance company that was "old school". I wanted a direct contact and someone I can actually talk or email quickly if I had questions or issues. Aaron Sessions office is exactly what I wanted! They answer my questions quickly and if they do not have an answer they look into it.

Aaron, Krista and the entire office work as a well oiled machine. I trust them and what I like the most is that they are honest. I am so happy I switched and if friends ask I definitely tell them about Aaron Sessions and team!<//review>

I have been working with Beth at Aaron Sessions' office for almost 15 years. After my husband passed away in 2007 and I still had three school-age children at home, Beth partnered with me to make important financial decisions that I was not comfortable making alone. She is always looking for ways for me to save money and at the same time, take into account that my situation is continuously evolving. I am very grateful for their professional guidance.< /Text>

I've been with Aaron Sessions over the past 9 years.  Aaron and his crew, including Bridget, have always been the best.  They respond quickly with my concerns.  They seem to always be available.  They are always looking for ways to save me money.  They don't try to oversell anything, only what you need.  I have many different types of policies with Aaron and feel comfortable that his team is watching over my best interests.<//Text>

< review>
I really do feel like I have friends at Aaron Sessions' State Farm. I've been with this group for probably over 10 years and I've always been treated with great customer service.
It first started with Beth, or Beth from State Farm as I call her, she's great.
Recently, several times, I've had the pleasure of working with Bridget, who I now will call Bridget From State Farm. ;)

Here's the latest example of why I continue to work with my friends at State Farm. On Tuesday my company realized that one of our work vans had been vandalized, so I called my State Farm office and Bridget answered the phone, I told her the story and she immediately go me connected to the claims department to open my claim, which was also very simple and convenient. They referred me to a local repair shop and within a couple hours our van was picked up and towed to the repair shop. Less than two days later, yesterday, we received an estimate with bad news that the part they needed was on back order and would take two to three months to arrive, what!!!

This not being acceptable I immediately called state farm and guess who answered, Bridget. I told her what the repair shop had said and that it wasn't acceptable to our business which needs the van, she understood and called the repair shop. A few minutes later she called me back and told me the shop is now prioritizing our repair. later in the day, again yesterday, she called back to tell me that the shop located the part in Fremont and would pick it up before the end of day.

Here's the amazing part. I just got a call from the shop saying the van would be ready at 2pm today! Is Bridget the best or what?!?!?!

Call State Farm today and ask for Bridget, if she doesn't answer.</review>

I switched over to Aaron Sessions' office about a year and a half ago after having an awful experience with my previous agent and I'm so glad I found them! Aaron was great in our initial meeting and took the time to go through my policies and explain things clearly to me without being "salesy". He has a very trustworthy, easy but caring demeanor about him which was so different from the agent I had before. Bridget is also fabulous and is my go to for when I need to get things done quickly. Based on my experience, the owner of the agency dictates the culture of the office and sets the expectations and standards for their employees and it's evident that this office places a high value on professionalism and maintaining trust with their customers. I definitely feel like I'm being taken care of and with that comes peace of mind.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

Our family has had insurance with State Farm only and the same agent up until a few years ago.  When John retired we were shuffled around to different agents, not feeling like a valued client after 50 plus years, until now.  We transferred our policies to Aaron Sessions office after reading  good reviews.  We had a lot of changes to make after a death in the family and Bridget handled everything for us.  I had lots of questions and the Head Office made some errors, however Bridget made sure it was all taken care of.   All was done through email and she is always, polite, pleasant, responsive and more than efficient.  You can tell she takes pride in taking care of the client.  While I hope to never need to place a claim,  I feel confident in knowing that we will be taken care of  and Bridget is a huge asset to this office.< /Review>

<Review>I got a text message from Krista in Aaron Sessions office asking me to send my odometer reading for the car so that she can adjust the miles that we are supposed to drive according to policy and save money. I did send the readings and saved a significant amount because -- Covid and retirement made both my wife and I stay home for past 10 months except going out for shopping. I appreciate how quickly and responsively they helped me and saved money! Any time I talk with Aaron, I found him to helpful, cordial and I do really believe that he is being a good neighbor! Thanks Aaron and Krista!< /Review>< rate>

I am very pleased with my experience meeting with Aaron.  I have future plans for remodeling and wanted to find out how/what should be changed with my current policy.

Aaron took his time explaining my options so I knew exactly what he was talking about and I could make the right decisions that were best for me.

I was also interested in fire and earthquake insurance. He did an excellent job explaining why they should be considered as important added policies.

It was a good experience and I was very grateful for the time and details he took to help.<//Text>

This has been hands down the best insurance agent and staff that I’ve ever had thus far. They have went above and beyond to accommodate me in a few instances. One person in particular, Bridget, has done many things to assist me even when it wasn’t necessarily in the scope of her job. If you live in the San Jose or Santa Cruz areas, do yourself a favor and go see these folks, they will get you sorted out and won’t treat you like “just another customer”.<//text>

This has been hands down the best insurance agent and staff that I’ve ever had thus far. They have went above and beyond to accommodate me in a few instances. One person in particular, Bridget, has done many things to assist me even when it wasn’t necessarily in the scope of her job. If you live in the San Jose or Santa Cruz areas, do yourself a favor and go see these folks, they will get you sorted out and won’t treat you like “just another customer”.</Text>

Aaron and team (Krista and Bridget especially) are super! Whenever I have had any concern, they are super responsive and get it fixed quickly. Aaron also was very helpful when I moved my policies to his office. Highly recommended!< /Review>

<text>Been with Aaron as a client since he first started. The professionalism, customer service, all around great experiences over all these years! I have referred Arron and his staff to many family and friends. Even when I moved out of the area, I still use Arron’s office!  It would be a mistake, if you do not call them and your loss.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x808e351c9cfb39b3:0x1db32bbe818401a7< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Aaron Sessions has been my agent since he started with State Farm. My experience with Aaron and his fantastic team has always been professional and accurate. They have always been extremely helpful and resourceful with all my questions and concerns. The knowledge, understanding, and commitment they provide, made me truly understand the importance of insurance, especially life insurance. If you are looking for an agency that will greet you with open arms, bend over backward to deliver on their promise, help you navigate through life challenges, and set you up for retirement success, you need to give Aaron and his team a call. Trust me, I would not have been with them for all these years if I did not believe in them or trust them 100%. I can't say I have always agreed with State Farm, but I can tell you I have always appreciated the openness and candor Aaron and his team provides. Thanks for all that you have done and will continue to do for me and my family.< /text>

Aaron is great! He goes above and beyond to make sure you are getting the right product you need. He really takes time to listen to your needs, and goes over everything to make sure you understand what you are getting. I really appreciated how he went over my current home and auto insurance, and explained in detail what everything means and made recommendations even when I didn't even have these policies with him. Highly recommend him!<//Text>

I like to give Bridget Barbieri at Statefarm Ins. In Campbell,Ca. A special thank you and complement her on her quick and thorough response to my recent request in changing some of my auto policy coverage.
Thanks to her! I feel I made the correct decision in signing up with Bridge@Statefarm Ins.
I honestly recommend this company.👍🏿
Thanks again!

<Text>We’ve been working with State Farm and Aaron’s Sessions team for almost 10 years.  Specifically and recently, we’ve had the pleasure of working with Beth Young who helped us through placing various new insurance policies as well as reviewing existing policies to make sure we are adequately covered at the best value possible. Beth was patient, knowledgeable, and responsive in every step of the way.  She also suggested or informed us about certain factors to consider when placing a policy that we would have otherwise not known about.  It’s always stress free working with this team (even when I unfortunately had to call for a minor fender bender!)  We would highly recommend Beth and this entire team for those who are looking for knowledgeable professionals , reputable company, and most of all dedicated client service.</Text>< pictures>

I’ve been a customer here for more than 10 years and I’m probably one of their early clients as they started. You don’t really think of insurance until you need it and that’s what make Aaron and his team different. They are super helpful when you need them. They have grown significantly but they managed to maintain their customer care at a high level. They are super responsive and have great value. They are my GO-to insurance team. They offer everything insurance related and most importantly they will give you peace of mind!<//text>

< Review>
I got started with Aaron Sessions as my account got bounced from one agent to another a while back. I had some issues with insurance in general so I made an appointment with Aaron and we sat down and went through the whole thing, personal and for my business. Immediately it was clear that Aaron was exceptional. He was not only thorough and competent, he readily “went to bat” for me on a disputed item, and put a lot of good new thought and perspective into my business insurance needs as well. For the first time in my life I feel like I understand my business and personal coverage, and have confidence in it. Aaron’s team is always very responsive, updates me on Important items, and follows up on my requests or concerns. This is how insurance should be handled.</Review>

<text>State farm transfered to me Aaron and his team when my old agent retired. They are wonderful! Very responsive and professional. They know their stuff too! If I have any questions and they don't know the answers they will get right on it and get me an answer right away. I met with them recently and they were quick to help me find ways to save money on my premium. I highly recommend them!</text><userid>108378100186669343753<//userid><pics>None<//pics><gmap_id>0x808e351c9cfb39b3:0x1db32bbe818401a7<//gmap_id><user_name>Jenny C<//user_name><Rate>5</Rate><Time>1603491857913< /Time><response>None<//response></record></dataset><record>

I recently moved and was in need of Renters Insurance. I reached out to this agency because I have other friends who hold policies with them and had nothing but amazing things to say. I spoke to Aaron at first and he transferred me to Bridget. I just can't say enough about BRIDGET! She was super responsive, very friendly and answered all of my questions (and even asked me some I didn't think to ask) She followed up with me after setting up my policy to make sure I was all set. Definitely recommend using this agency for your insurance needs! ;)< /review>

<Review>I had moved to South Bay following years of State Farm great support in both MI and TX.  Arron and his fab team including a very wise advisor, Golden Retriever, did not disappoint. Lots of transitions moving into a new area, these guys made the insurance one nice and easy.  Cally driving, not so easy , had a auto accident at worst time possible , Krista took over. Helped with rental car to claims...great group!< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x808e351c9cfb39b3:0x1db32bbe818401a7<//gmapID></record>

As a company leader my time is limited and I rely on experts in their fields to do what they do best. Beth Young and her team at Aaron's office are absolute experts that I've come to trust and rely on for all things insurance, even when our needs are is outside of State Farm's service area. Beth's helped us with all of our insurance needs to open three challenging new offices in less than six months. Not to mention the four established offices and multiple corporate vehicles that she continuously makes sure we're up to date with.

I know that if I need anything she's there to help. Not only does she look out for our "current" needs, she anticipates situations that helps me do my job better (and look good in front of my superiors).

Beth, You're the absolute best, hands down, and I can't thank you enough for everything you do.</Text>

Aaron Sessions State Farm has always been helpful with me and my family for several years.  When my children were learning how to drive Aaron Sessons helped me with the best coverage for both my house and the cars and went though the possible liability should they get into an accident.

Aaron has been my State Farm agent for years and have been very happy since switching over from another insurance company.  What I appreciate most about him and his staff is how friendly they are and their willingness to help as quickly as possible.  Whatever it is that you need they are on top of it.  They really go above and beyond to take care of their clients and although there are cheaper options in the market, Aaron and his staff really represent State Farm well and go above and beyond with their excellent customer care.  They deliver great peace of mind and the value they deliver isn't appreciated until you're in a pinch and really need help right away, in which case I know that this office will come though; I know because I had to actually needed their help :)  The biggest thing is that when you do need help, it's Aaron and his staff that help you, not an 800 number line.  When you call, it's the actual staff that works at his office and Aaron himself.  Please be my agent forever, you and your staff are really great!< /review>

I have been completely satisfied with Aaron Sessions and his entire staff since choosing him for all of my insurance needs nine years ago.  I am always treated with respect and receive timely responses to my calls and emails alike.  The staff spends whatever amount of  time is needed to answer my questions and to address any / all concerns I have.

Krista Stouffer has become a great asset since joining Aaron's team. She is always (yes, always!) pleasant and professional.  She is quick to help and makes sure that I'm satisfied before wrapping up whatever we've worked on together. I appreciate her thoroughness and "it's no trouble at all" attitude.

I continue to recommend Aaron to my friends and family.<//text>

Aaron and Bridget are amazing to work with getting back to me immediately with suggestions and answers. I was using another insurance company for 40 years (with no personal contact) so it goes without saying that State Farm is  the only company that I will work with. The referrals I have given them have been extremely happy as well.
Grateful to have found them.<//text>

I’ve been with Aaron and his crew for over a decade. I moved out of the South Bay Years ago and into the Central Valley, but they’re so nice and easy to work with that I’ve stayed with them anyway. They are pleasant, professional, and always make it easy for me to manage my insurance needs whenever life changes. As far as pricing goes, I know I’m getting a good deal too. I sometimes get quotes from other companies (when the budget gets tight), but over the years I have never gotten a better rate than State Farm. So that makes it easy to stay too.

Thanks Aaron and MANY thanks to your reps for always taking care of me.< /review>

The team at the Aaron Sessions office is awesome! In the 12+ years I've held insurance with State Farm I've had the pleasure of working with this office. They are always friendly and go above and beyond. Most importantly their response time is phenomenal. I never have to wait for help. In fact, one time I called about rental car insurance while I was checking out at the airport and the team answered my call within minutes and got me what I needed. I'll never switch insurance companies because nothing can compare to the service I get.<//text>

<Review>I contacted Aaron's team a year go to switch car insurance providers.   Since then, Sal has been very responsive and helpful when issues pop up.  I recently reduced my mileage (due to remote work).  Even when the central office mis-calculated my update, he followed up with them the same day to re-process the request.

Thanks Sal for the quick, effective and friendly responses!< /Review><response>None</response>< gmapID>

I love working with Aaron and his staff, mainly Bridget Barbieri! She's fast, she's available on email, phone, and text.  She treats me as if I'm her only customer (i know it is not the case).  I have been with Aaron and State Farm for over 7 years now, I left AAA after 20 years and very happy I have done so!</Text>

<user_name>Evelyn Policriti< /user_name><Review>I've been insured with Aaron Sessions (State Farm) for so many years now that I have lost count of how long it has actually been. His hand picked team is truly the best group of insurance agents you will find. They are professional, polite and genuinely want to do whats best for you. I never feel like there is any pressure to purchase anything that I am not comfortable with. While other agencies seem pushy and only want commission from your purchase, the atmosphere in Aaron's office the exact opposite of that.

Before I was with Aaron Sessions, I never really understood the insurance policies that I had. I just knew it was against the law to drive around without insurance so I bought whatever the agent said I should have and that was that. It wasn't until Aaron explained and broke it all down that I finally understood what I was paying for and why it was necessary. Aaron's team is not only dedicated to selling you good/quality insurance but they are also dedicated to making sure that you understand exactly what you are paying for. They go above and beyond to make sure everything you buy suits your actual needs. After all, why would you pay for Hurricane insurance if you live in California?! Or why would you buy boat insurance if you don't own a boat?!

Beth Young personally handles all of my accounts with care. She follows up with me each year to make sure my policies are still relevant to my current needs. We do an annual touch base just in case there are any changes to my family. She is always happy to give me a quote for anything I may need and responds to my requests within a reasonable time (usually within 24hrs).

There's no better agency to go to if you are looking for insurance of any kind. I highly recommend Aaron Sessions.<//Review>< Rate>

<pics>None< /pics><Text>I was unlucky enough to have a deer damage my vehicle during evacuation with my family from the recent Santa Cruz wildfires.

As we have bundled home and auto insurance with State Farm I elected to get my vehicle repaired and  only wanted the best bodyshop to do the work. Once the shop inspected the damage I lodged a claim easily using the StateFarm phone app in around 10 minutes.

The initial claim was approved the same day so I could get the vehicle repairs started. When more damage was detected by the repairer additional claims were approved and paid without delay.

A member of Aarons team also reached out to me during evacuation to check our status and was able to confirm all our coverage was up to date and adequate in case we faced a real risk of total loss of home and other vehicles. Luckily our home was spared.

To have an insurance company provide such prompt processing, approval and payment during such a stressful time was an incredible asset to lowering our stress levels and gave tremendous peace of mind.<//Text><username>Gordon Everitt</username>< time>

I have a secondary medical policy with State Farm.  Recently I received several bills, but my policy pays 100% after Medicare. I called Beth and she contacted the insurance for me & cleared up the issue!  She is great to work with and always professional. I highly recommend State Farm for all your insurance needs.</text>

<Review>Its been a pleasure working with Beth Young and entire team at Aaron Sessions office. They have been very responsive and patient in all the ad-hoc requests made for the documents. They also recommend insurance products from time to time which might suit our portfolio. ( But never try to over-sell anything ). Their rates are always competitive and they went above and beyond to find us correct insurance coverage based on our needs. Will refer them in a heartbeat to anyone!<//Review><Rate>5</Rate>< name>

<review>I have had vehicle insurance through Aaron Sessions’ office for about 18 years now and would never think of going anywhere else. No matter who I talk to, I am always well taken care of with professionalism, kindness, patience and sincerity. Aaron, Krista and Bridget are awesome—they have helped me most recently with some changes, and I always appreciate their fast responses along with kept promises. When I am told something will happen, they are always true to their word. Last, I never have to worry about losing unnecessary money, as they are ever vigilant in having my back. Thank you so much guys!< /review>< pics>

<text>As a mortgage broker since 1997, I have have worked with many insurance agents in the process of securing mortgages for my clients.  I have never though worked with one more on top of their business than Aaron.  His professionalism, knowledge and forward thinking approach to his business and customer service are 2nd to none and why I send my clients to him.  I know they will be taken care of the same way I do and that means a lot to me to encompass the entire home buying experience.

"LIKE A GOOD NEIGHBOR, STATE FARM IS THERE" At Aaron Session's office, it's not only a jingle but a fact! The best part is, We have our very own personal  "Jake" but her name is "BETH"! and yes, I've had to call her at "3 in the morning" but never have asked what she's wearing!

In October of 2019 my car window was smashed in and broken into. This happened just hours before boarding a flight out of the country for two weeks! Beth and the Sessions team was there to help me file a claim, repair my car, detail my car, received compensation for the items stolen, car rental, etc. and during this whole ordeal, Beth was hand holding this thing all the way to completion!

The level of care, service, professionalism, follow through and efficiency will not be found elsewhere. It really should be,

Bridget is always very friendly and helpful. I needed some information for my current insurance and my Home/Car insurances in Colorado thru State Farm. Immediately after my request, I received a call from the SF agent here. And I am planning to go with State Farm for my cars and home, old and new, here in Colorado.

In the past, whenever I needed help for me or my daughter, Bridget was very helpful.< /Review>

Aaron and his team have been incredibly helpful to me and my husband over the years. Whenever anything unexpected comes along, it's of immense comfort to know that I can turn to them to help guide me through it. A tree once fell on my truck, not something one can plan for. Still, Beth Young was there to immediately help me file a claim, get the damage repaired, and even knew the best body shop in town. It's a comfort to know that when something beyond your control comes along, they're there to help you deal with it.<//text>

After recently finding it necessary to add Renters Insurance to my policy, State Farm has been incredibly helpful each step of the way. While this is my first time buying Renters Insurance, I feel well informed and prepared. From the beginning, I was redirected to my agent, Aaron Sessions, and his wonderful team, including Bridget, who has personally walked me through each step of the process. Bridget has delivered clear and thorough information to me and has responded very quickly to each of my requests. Not to mention, immediately making sure all discounts applicable were activated on my policy. Thanks to the team at State Farm, I feel like I can always count on the support I may need when it comes to my policy.<//text>

<review>A+ service from Aaron Sessions State Farm everytime! Sal is always so patient with the questions I have and is always willing to provide me with information. I can't recommend this office enough to anyone looking for insurance. The service you receive here is superior to cheaper agencies like Geico and Progressive. Reach out to them and ask for Sal, you will not regret it.<//review>< pictures>

< review>
I just retired and have been like most others at home for safety reasons. I was treated very well when renewing my policy. I was asked the right questions about car use, sheltering-in-place and other factors, like mileage that  might change the status of my policy.  Payment was collected a later to help economically. I could not have asked for more.
Thank you for the VP treatment during this pandemic!</review>

Awesome experience with auto insurance during COVID-19 pandemic. Contacted for my current mileage and was rewarded with over $200 reduction in my 6 month insurance payment. Thank you Aaron and Krista.</text>

<review>Aaron Sessions is the best insurance agent I have ever had.  He is smart and pro-active, and he does a thorough review with you  of all your policies and how they work together to optimize your coverage and to minimize your expenses.

Recently worked with Sal in this office to move all of our insurance plans over to State Farm.  He took us through the quoting process and explained everything thoroughly and answered all of our questions and we had a ALOT.  Everything was handled with the utmost professionalism AND best of all we actually ended up saving money on our policies.  I am really happy we made the switch from our old insurance company and have found a new office that gives us such great customer service.</review>

<Review>I use to be with Liberty Insurance but when I moved to Rinconada Hills in Los Gatos, Liberty refused to insure my new home claiming it was fire-prone.

My mortgage broker recommended Aaron Sessions State Farm for insurance.  They gave me a fair quote for Home and Auto Insurance and made sure I got all the discounts.

After closing, Aaron and his support staff of Krista and Beth have been very helpful.  Aaron also invited is into his office to review the coverage in detail.  He also offered to review our long term care insurance.

When he did he explained what I had bought 10 years ago in plain English and made it very understandable. Plus he didn't try to sell us anything.

Aaron and his team have provided the best insurance support I have ever had.

Highly Recommended!<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

I highly recommend Aaron Sessions - State Farm Insurance. His Customer Service Representatives are exceptional. They are knowledgable and very courteous. Aaron and his CSR - Krista have always been very kind in answering all of my questions and very efficient in filling all of my insurance needs. If you have questions about insurance, you should call someone you can trust with your insurance needs - Call Aaron Sessions.< /text>

I have been working with State Farm Campbell on getting a Car and Renters insurance (after considering other companies of course). I appreciate the great service and high coverage options.
Beth Young does an excellent Job getting you the right deals and was always very fast to respond to my E-Mails (which is my preferred way to communicate). There is also the option to go to the office where you will experience the same great service.<//review>

In all my years as a consumer end-user as well as a self-employed person, I've very rarely experienced on a grand-scale, consistent basis, such exceptional treatment as a client then I have from this most excellent, top-of-the-line insurance provider!

Seriously, if you're looking for an insurance provider and a place to call home when it comes to all of your insurance needs, don't concern yourself in spending even one more second in going beyond this gem of a "got it all together" insurance office.

Not at all to sound corny, but, seriously, "like a good neighbor, Aaron Sessions and State Farm are there for you!" Mark my words, once you become their client, you'll never look back.

I cannot tell you how many individuals that I've personally recommended to this office. In fact, there have been times when I've actually conferenced a call between friends and Aaron's office to introduce said friends to this first class outfit.

It's a wonderful feeling to never have even one iota of a doubt that the friends and associates that mean much to me will consistently and invariably receive "second-to-none" customer service - integrity abounds from whichever team member answers the phone because Aaron has, literally, the very best and most genuine and most professional individuals working in his office.

By the way, if you happen to have Bridget answer the phone when you call this office, oh my, you will be speaking with, and mark my words on this, one of THE most professional, knowledgeable and pleasant individuals you'll ever encounter from any business, period, end of story! Aaron really scored big time when he hired her Bridget!

She is an absolute gem and what a tremendous blessing and true asset to Aaron - he should be ever so thankful that Bridget is on his team and part of his business.

In addition, having personally met Aaron on numerous occasions at his office over the many years that I've been a client and knowing and experiencing his integrity, I'm quite confident that he often reflects on what a blessing he has in his midst like of the likes of Bridget.

What is so amazing too, as mentioned in the beginning of my review here, that when you call Aaron's office, any individual who answers the phone will immediately win your confidence, the staff working there "really are" THAT good! So, you can imagine if you happen to get Bridget on the other line as your representative that you're in for a real treat!

Well, that's my full report!

Quick FYI: Let me be super clear that I have no relatives or connections to anyone working at Aaron's office and no one has coerced me to write this review.

Consider this review and this highest of recommendations a true joy for me to write because it has been a true joy to write.

By recommending Aaron Sessions and his first-class team, I know that I know that I know that I've helped someone along the way (and hopefully many along the way) who desire to look no further for the very best insurance office for all of their insurance needs!</text>

I have known Aaron Sessions for over 8 years. He is a great person and great agent. I have had and still have several insurance policies with him covering both business and home liability for many years. His team is always friendly and courteous. Whenever I need to provide proof of insurance, Aaron and his team take care of my request while I am on the phone. I don’t often encounter this high level of service. I give Aaron and his team my highest recommendation.< /review>

<text>I have been purchasing my insurance from Aaron Session's office for the last 4 years. I feel very blessed to have had the opportunity to work with Bridget during this time. She offered me the care and responsiveness that I feel should be used as the standard. Not only is she easy to talk to, she really listens to your needs and offers the best policy to fulfill those needs. She is just awesome at what she do! Thank you Bridget for all of these years!<//text><pics>None</pics>< response>

Aaron Sessions and his staff always reply promptly without sales pressure or upselling, and even offer ideas to save money.   Haven't had a claim yet so I'm not sure how smoothly that will be handled.  It is worth checking them out when it is time for comparison shopping or adding a new policy.</Review>

<text>State Farm is always professional, courteous, and helpful when I call... and I always get a live person on the phone. Bridget and Aaron recently assisted me in problem-solving around an issue I had with flood insurance through my HOA. They both spent time to address this with me, even though the issue ultimately had nothing to do with my State Farm homeowner's insurance... yet they still assisted! It was greatly appreciated.

I wrote the above paragraph several years ago, and I am chiming in again. After 20 years with Aaron Sessions State Farm, I have had nothing but positive experiences. Friendly customer service/timely and thoughtful e-mail replies, clear communication, and coverage that has always been reasonable and helpful in all situations. Bridget recently assisted me with transitioning and changing some of my coverage after selling my home and moving. I will now have a new State Farm agent since I moved 3,000 miles away - and I will miss Aaron Sessions. They have consistently set the bar high.< /text>< userid>

If you are looking for a reliable insurance company, go with State Farm, and choose Aaron Sessions as your agent. You can thank me later!

Aaron and every member of his team is incredibly helpful. Aaron is very knowledgeable about insurance and life planning in general, and will provide you with valuable guidance on how to secure your future. Huge shout out to his staff members Bridget, Sean and Krista as well, who are ever so helpful and quick with anything you need.</review>

<text>We can't say enough about the hospitality and service we receive from Aaron and his team.  We've been loyal customers for many years and they have always gone above and beyond what we would expect from an insurance agency.

Our main contact is Beth, and she is a pleasure to deal with!  My wife and I always leave the office feeling secure, knowing that Aaron and the crew are there whenever we need them.

Living in San Jose, there are many other State Farm agents we could have chosen, but we gladly make the drive over to Campbell just for the outstanding service we receive here.  (Plus they offer free cold drinks while you're there)< /text>< Pics>

<text>Aaron's been my agent since he took on the Campbell office and I couldn't be more pleased with how I have been treated. His staff is very attentive and always helpful. I no longer live in the area so I was afraid that this would mean I'd have to change agents to get good service, but that has not been the case.< /text></record>

We switched over to State Farm when we moved into our new home at the beginning of the year. First of all, combining our auto & home with them was WAY cheaper than other companies we looked at.

Second, Beth couldn't have been more helpful when making our decision. She answered every question clearly and was very friendly. Then, when we came in for our orientation, Aaron met with us on a Saturday afternoon and walked us through everything - even perks of our coverage we didn't know we had. He also added "i don't care if something happens at 2 in the morning - call me."

Even months into our coverage, if a simple question pops up I shoot Beth an email and I have an answer within a couple hours. Their immediate, friendly service and willingness to help puts us at ease! I'd recommend with no hesitations.</review>

This State Farm office is so pleasant to deal with. They call or email when they have information to lower my insurance. They helped my high school graduate apply for a first Visa card. Communication with the staff is always easy and clear. I highly recommend this State Farm location.</Review>

<review>I am insured with Aaron Sessions (State Farm) for about 8 yrs now and have only positive things to share. Interacting with the friendly team is very easy and pleasant. The insurance products are easy to understand and also can be changed flexibly as your life situations change. My best experience with Aaron Sessions and State Farm insurance was a few years ago when the Loma Fire damaged my property and State Farm quickly resolved the damage to my full satisfaction. All my claims were quickly resolved and damaged to dwellings and personal property were quickly and fully paid for.  Cannot praise this insurance company higher.

<review>Greetings friends of San Jose! My name is Michael, and I recently moved to California from the East Coast. Though my only experience for insurance has been with State Farm, my time with Aaron has certainly been my best (from 3 states over ten years).

Moving from any state comes with many challenges. One of those challenges is a long list of transfers, such as car insurance, dental, school, etc. My agent 2100 miles away knew of Aaron and recommended him wholeheartedly. Still, I felt inclined to do my due diligence and researched several agents in Silicon Valley to ensure I would be taken care of if an emergency arose, God forbid. Don't waste your time researching-- this office is good people and deserve your resources. Bridgette handled my move seamlessly and made me feel a part of the San Jose community before I even got off the plane. Not only did she communicate with the Atlanta office without me lifting a finger, but she recommended places to live, restaurants to eat, and sites to experience.

Upon my arrival, a meeting at the office (on a Saturday, nonetheless) was recommended, but I could not find the time to get into the office. I called Aaron on the phone, introduced myself, and had a small conversation. Most of you will agree that seldom do actual agents take the time to speak with you, especially about smaller ticket items or just to check in. Aaron is available at any time if you feel that you need to speak with the 'big boss'. He will be there for your family, and he will make sure you are taken care of. Even on Saturdays...

The service Aaron's team has provided me to date has been nothing but spectacular. I would recommend any insurance customer (Auto, Home, etc.) in the Bay Area to consider this team to take care of you... In times of need, Aaron, Bridgette, Sean, and the rest of the crew in Campbell will make sure you feel important, and help you survive some of the most difficult times in life. I wholeheartedly suggest you give Aaron a chance. It will be a 5-star experience.

Best,
Michael Brown<//review><gmapID>0x808e351c9cfb39b3:0x1db32bbe818401a7</gmapID><date>1493862153121< /date>< userid>

<review>All the agents in this office have provided fast and courteous service whenever I've had a problem or question. They will personally call you if you've forgotten to make a payment rather than letting things lapse or charging you a late fee.   Definitely has the feel of a small-town office in the halcyon days when good customer service was the norm.< /review>< pictures>

Based on the friendliness of staff and the quality of service, I would highly recommend Aaron Sessions and his staff at State Farm to all those searching for insurance. The prices are competitive with other insurance agencies, and I have continued to feel like a valued customer through the many years I have done business with this company.<//text>

I am very happy with my car insurance and the amazing service that I receive from themy when I come into the office orevenue over the telephone.

Today I couldn't make it into the office and an agent inside the office name Krista Stouffer was very patient with me, and helped me find the best payment option for my insurance. She also made a suggestion for me to apply for a state Farm visa.

Thank you so much for all the help, I was able to get a payment plan that works best for me set up.

I'm also going to come into the office to sign up for life insurance.<//Review>

Time after time I get great service from Krista at Aaron Sessions. Having to change policies 3 times a month, adding/increasing coverage, and removing other things due to moving to temporarily adding a rented RV that is covered (at no additional cost - might I add) ... They deliver and the turn around time is amazing!<//text>

<review>02-07-2020 What a nice Subway. Super clean. really happy with my chopped salad Black Forest Ham double meat double cheese extra avacado with all veggies extra jalapeno slices. Yum. Seems like the man who helped me may have been the owner. Either way kudos to the good feeling when I walked in.< /review>< GmapID>

As a healthcare provider I’m very concerned that no one was wearing a mask. The store had a roped off area where customers stand to give some distance from the food preparation area, however the staff was not wearing masks. When I asked him if they have masks he stated, “it’s not required.”

For everyone’s safety including the safety of your staff (since you’re interacting with so many people in a closed space) I highly recommend wearing masks and encourage customers to be cautious of eating here during this time COVID.</text>

Walked in just as it opened @7:30 but was not greeted by a friendly face. If you're going to own a business, the first thing you can do is be friendly and I dont care what time it is. We know Santa Nella Village is a travelers place, so dont be frustrated by the prices. The sandwich was not upto Subway standards. Poorly distributed ingredients is of great concern to me because on a few bites all i got was bread.<//review>

<text>Went here awhile back and definitely won’t be going back here. APP deals are not accepted at this location, store was not so clean, avocados on food station was already blackened, Wilted lettuce and tomatoes. If you want more than 5 olives for a foot long you need to ask. And if the employee is irritated by your food option requests they refuse you service. Meaning if you want more of items instead of a pinch of this and that. I’ve seen it before right in front of us. The customer experience isn’t all that. Once I saw how they treated customers while we were dining here and at that moment I wish we wouldn’t have ordered any food from here. It made my stomach turn and I couldn’t even eat anymore as I was so disgusted by there demeaning manners. Usually we clean off our table and wipe any mess but we were so annoyed from there actions we just wanted to leave ASAP! After all they deserved the family of 10 lunch disaster after the way they treated a small family. 🙄🙄😒😒 Travel 20 more minutes away to Los Banos and you get better customer service and more quantity of items. No I would definitely not recommend them!</text></record>

<text>Good place to stop if you have a big rig or large RV. Lots of parking on the road ahead of store. Prices are higher than other subways. This place is in the boonies so that’s probably why. Wonder where their workers live. I would eat here again if I was in the area with my RV.<//text>< Pictures>

<text>The staff were extremely polite and personable. The sandwich, hot pastrami was one of the better Subway sandwiches I've ever had. The restaurant was clean and neat. Above standard results compared to other Subway locations in the valley IE Modesto</text>< response>

<review>NOT friendly if you have food allergies. I requested the food prep table be sanitized due to food allergies I have. I was then told they wouldn't do that and was refused any service. I thought this was strange since I have never experienced this at any other subway so I called corporate customer service and they apologized to me and sent the owner a message.

< Review>
The time to close this subway shows 10:00PM, & we were there at 9:25PM but the person in subways said it closed. We were on the way from tracy to fresno and we switch our route to this subway. Very bad experience at this Subway location.</Review>

Family owned and run. They show attitude and aren't friendly to vegetarians. The quantity of stuffing is way less than  other subways Avoid the place if you can.</text>

This place has incredibly rude workers who made me feel stupid. They told me an order cost $58 dollars. I gave them $108. The lady looked at me, said that didn't make any sense, and charged it out of $100. They also charged me for 7 bags of chips when my group only got 6 bags of chips. Will NEVER come here again.<//text>

Mediocre at best. Old man and younger man, easily frustrated. Bread undercooked. No air conditioning, so eat at once. Independent standing business so you have to go out your way to get to subway.  Presentation of sandwiches leaves A LOT to be desired.<//Text>

Dr. Kariya has been my physician for many years. She is extremely attentive and very patient. Her bedside manner is excellent. She truly cares about her patients and always makes you feel extremely comfortable. She is beyond understanding and always addresses all of your concerns and questions without hesitation. Responds quickly when communicating with her via MyChart. She is awesome.< /text>

I have been a patient with MemorialCare for 23 years, and I am so glad to have found such a wonderful facility, especially finding Dr. Kariya. She is always on top of my health issues. I would highly recommend her to anyone. Thank you Dr. Kariya!!!<//Text>

<Review>Dr Kariya respects my decision to be plant based and knows I am healthier for it. Though she prefers I get vaccinated, I told her I was not vaccinated as a child, I had all the childhood diseases, and at age 67 I am healthier than almost every other person my age. She is a good doctor, willing to work with me. This visit was just a physical. I had not been to see the doctor for two years.<//Review></record>

Dr Kariya is the best primary care physician I have ever seen. She is very thorough and provides the very best of care while being a cheerful friendly person. She really cares about her patients and I always leave with a smile on my face. She follows up to ensure that I am improving and provides a specialist reference if needed. Number one physician!</text>

Food was very good and the people were friendly. Or so we thought. Apparently they don't like out of staters. Over $70 for three beverages and two simple breakfasts? They saw us coming. Should have never worn a shirt saying where we were from. We just paid it and left.<//review>

<text>Nice spot with picnic tables and plenty of rocks to climb. The only thing is there was no shade by the tables. You have to find a shady spot between the rocks. The oak tree itself is probably the best shady spot there. Just head down the dirt road to the right once you turn off the main road and go all the way to the turnaround at the end. You can't miss it.< /text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Love this spot! Went here last month with my eight year old son and we had a blast exploring the area and climbing the rocks. Joshua Tree is truly a magical place, I can't believe I had never stopped at the Live Oak Picnic Area before!<//review>

Lovely spot. I wouldn't go in summer I imagine it gets brutal as there is no reprieve from the shade. But other seasons it's very peaceful.<//review>

In Joshua Tree national park. Before the shutdown and subsequent carnage. Here's a pic of my girlfriend Denise with her impersonation of The Madonna of the Immaculate Conception. What do you think?< /Review>

Nice beautiful park. Beautiful turf with trees around to sit under. Playground for kids.
Beautiful place for Weddings. BBQ pits and pick Nick areas. Pets welcome, leash law.
BEAUTIFUL Sycamore trees. In High Winds sometime these trees can be dangerous as with any trees.<//Text>

<review>While on a drive my wife and I decided to stop and eat our lunch at Biddle Park.  I had only been there once before.  While there were bathrooms and some playgrounds, most of the area looked, generally, in disrepair.  That is, except for a beautiful lush green lawn that would have served wonderfully as multiple soccer fields.  There was a camp host trailer that looked like something out of Deliverance, all in all, the location was nice, but the entire feel was kind of creepy.< /review><rating>3</rating>< GmapID>

Fairly large park with good facilities and game fields. A club bike ride stopped there and had lots of room to spread out comfortably. Real restrooms made it very convenient.  Lots of trees for those hot days and plenty of picnic tables.</Review>

< Review>
Biddle park is great if youre looking for alone time or to avoid regular park crowds. There's hardly anyone there at any given time, except for the few who take their dogs to run off leash. (Leash law is loosely enforced.) The park itself isn't maintained except for the soccer field which is nicely mowed. Just watch out for the random drug deals that are known to take place in the back corner of the park.</Review>

There's even an old fashioned, terrifying merry go round.  Great place to learn both centrifugal force and first aid!< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Great out of the way day park for all events such as baseball, football, charity events, birthdays and anything else toughy could think of for the day. Rangers onsite,and well kept grounds.
Located just before Lopez Lake this day park is $3  entry, open at dawn,closes at dusk< /text>

<text>Actually, not impressed.  Got there early, ended up meeting a nice young Park Ranger.  Here I was flying a quadcopter, just trying to capture a few good pics for my book I'm doing to highlight the beauty of the Central Coast.  As it turned out, all is well but I'm really disturbed about why us recreational flyers don't have a place to go to get away from people, dogs, cars, dogs, more dogs, and more people.  Trust me, while I speak for a community of others.....we could care less about "spying" on anyone.  This fobia about quadcopters snooping down on people, my goodness.... that's the last thing we would like to think of.< /text><UserId.>105944526259462000715<//UserId.>< Name>

<review>I just want to say I’m glad I have this number now to get cars towed!!!! People keep parking in my stall and it’s annoying. I did call today and whoever answered was quick to help. However, the owner of the car saw me and quickly moved his car (he saved himself) I’m definitely saving this number cause I know I’ll be using it soon.</review>< Time>

<time>1617360277139<//time><rating>1</rating><review>Real peice of work this company is. Not just myself but many others who live at the apartment where my car was towed from believe the security guard from the complex ,who is almost identical in physical appearance to the owner of the tow company, and the owner of the tow yard are benefiting from one another. The owner of the tow company tried to charge for police impound fees of 290$ even after the police informed me they had nothing to do with the tow. Very unprofessional and ignorant. I'm filing a law suit against them. What they doing ain't goo buisness at all it's fraud and cheating hard working people out of their money<//review>< Pics>

You guys basically stole my car last nights and claimed someone called you. I poked a hole in your story to which you said you had a contract with my apartment to tow my car. Then you illegally towed my car. There was not sign that said I couldn’t park there. I’ve lived in this complex for almost 3 years. Never heard of the type of stunts you pulled. You have no shame and your crooked business practices are despicable.</Text>

<Text>Honestly who likes getting they're car towed but all in all I realized it was my fault and it's just they're job. Really polite lady answered the phone and let me know what I had to bring in. I rated them 3 stars because they are way overpriced. I asked around with local towing companies and they quoted me much less for the tow with the same distance. That to me was unfair so I asked the guy in the front desk for a reasonable deduction and just kept looking down as he wrote my recipe, and said no theres nothing I can do.<//Text>< Pics>

I just seen this company’s tow truck pull into my apartment complex, back up to my car parked in a designated stall (which is owned with no fees owed to the dmv it’s a ‘99) I got the company name and number off the side of the truck, and when they realized I was watching, they quickly left. No other car was parked illegally, they had no reason to be there. What were they doing? I called the Fresno police department to document this. And I will notify my apartment manger ASAP. Did I just witness Phoenix towing trying illegally take my car? I called the company and they said they had no info on what they were doing here in the first place.<//Review>

First off it would be nice if you "Reviewed" the cameras to see that some one was doubled Parked and took their vehicle. Then we could have fit both the cars you towed, we've given up calling you guys because you don't tow away cars that are parked in front of a fire hydrant or a red zone. How do I know this? Because the car is their the next morning and the day after that. I call to find out that my car is being held for ransom even though I was not parked in such a way to block any fire trucks from getting in. On that note no laws were broken, you have no idea the amount of cars that park such as I did and leave it there till morning. Where were you then? $300? Really? Must be nice to take advantage of people that don't deserve it huh? Thanks, do you have $300 I can borrow? Like seriously, $150 makes more sense than $300 within 24 hours then $50/a day after that. Also asked if they can work with me, they said no.< /Text>

If i can give a no star I would . I  encounter  One is the tow truck drivers , who was driving like a maniac in the streets ,and  almost hit my car . I ended up On The side of the road . It was a merging lane and I was head of him but instead he drives really fast to past me , but it was already the end of the second lane . He didn’t let me stay ahead and I had to choice but to go on the side of the Road to prevent getting hit. And he had the nerve after almost hitting my car to give me the finger . I hope some gets in contact with me . Owner lying , rude person and shows why he has horrible ratings . I will have amazing day . You do same looks like you need it. :) he’s shows what’s relevant to him . But they responds proof of the bad customer service he has . So beware working with someone like him<//Review>

Zero stars towed my vehicle and smashed the side in, Robert was very unprofessional and we are in the process of a lawsuit!! If this company comes to tow your vehicle for any reason be warned! They steal and will damage your car and say they didn’t.<//Text>

My sister came to my apartment parked her car be behind MY GARAGE and these guys picked it up!!! On receipt it says blocking garage for reason they took the car MY GARAGE!!! These guys were very unprofessional and charged us 463- to get the car back!!!!!! This is outrages I have lived at my complex for 5 years and this has never happened EVER. Not to mention we have parking issues in the past and they never show up! I think these guys were bored and had nothing else to do so they came by. I’m going to do some research and see what I can do to sue this company because this is unfair.</Review>

<Text>They are the worst!!! Worst service ever!!!! If I could give zero stars I would. The owner was so difficult and argumentative from beginning to end. It was bad enough that the situation was unpleasant he made it even more unpleasant with the way he handles business. My car was towed bc my apartment complex requires a parking pass in order to park in our parking lot. I initially told the owner of Phoenix Towing that the pass was in the car. I asked him if he was willing to work with me and he said let’s go see. So, I looked through the window and pointed out the pass to him it was in the car on the floor of my car. When I opened the door I pulled out the parking pass from the car and showed it to him. He still was not willing to release my vehicle to me with out full payment. Then he asked for my registration which I didn’t have with me and I wasn’t informed over the phone before I came to the towing company that I needed to have my registration with me. So he wasn’t willing to release my car even with full payment. I called my insurance agent to see if they could provide proof of registration and she explained that ALLSTATE does not insure unless you are the registered owner of the vehicle. He argued with my insurance saying it wasn’t true bc he has some of his truck through ALLSTATE and he knew that wasn’t true. She tried explaining to him that it is different for business insurance than for individual insurance but he just kept talking over her and being argumentative. My apartment manager who I previously spoke to said that she would try to talk to him but she called him and he told her he would call her back when he was done with my transaction. The paying process was also difficult he argued with me during that transaction. Then when I went to get my car I notice some scratches. This is the worst towing company I’ve ever had to deal with.</Text></record></dataset><record>

They recovered my vehicle after it was stolen and left at a private property. They were all very polite and courteous, going over the charges and advising me how to claim it with my insurance. They even allowed me to make a quick repair on their lot to get my car running again. Great experience after a stressful week!</review>

My son's fiance parked in what used to be a visitor parking spot but has been painted over.  She was here an hour and when she went to leave the car had been towed.  There were other cars parked right next to hers that didn't have permits and they were not towed.  It was towed after midnight and to pick it up less than 8 hours later was $381.00. Unbelievable all I can say is they better come back and tow every other unlawfully parked vehicle.<//Review>

I was parked in front of my grandmother's mobile home for 20 minutes with my hazard lights on, and they towed my car! It was a Saturday morning and I was quoted $340 to get it out that day. Or, $430 if I waited til Monday! It was towed from private property... For what reason, I still don't know! Every time I have asked the reason it has changed. Blocking a driveway, being in an unmarked fire lane,  and because my hazard lights were on?  A year ago, my step mom was towed from the same spot because her hazard were NOT on. But when I went yesterday to their office, they told me it was $283. They refused to make a copy of the invoice for me to see before I pay it though! So, I have to pay whatever they tell me to...legal OR NOT! And to top it off...why do they keep their front door locked during normal business hours; only willing to open it after telling the make, model, and year of the vehicle you're there for? Because they're crooks and they know it!<//Review>

Worst of the worst. My car got stolen and cops found it said it was towed. I call them to let them know and said they had no report of it being stoleni needed a report number. When i got the report and number that they asked for all of a sudden it wasnt no good and i had to pay for it because it was parked in the wrong place, even when i got proof it was stolen. These people rob you guys be alert and be aware. Dont park in the wrong spot and if they steal ur car there gonna give u so many run arounds to not let that go and get paid. I asked for a copy of thier policys to see the thin lines to see if it was legit and they said they had no policy which tells you they can do we they want. Dont use these people to get ur car towed either i heard so many stories about that as well. These people are a cheat idc what anyone says and i guess there gonna write back and claim it didnt go down like that. And people thats a lie if i could give negative stars i glady would. Just notice im not the only one complaining and rating this company with little stars, and most of these reviews are from customers who are almost saying the same thing. Beware!</review>

Friendly service but 2 stars because they work directly with our crappy management at our apartments and both party denies posting a tow notification on my car. Stupid management says it Phoenix towing that does it, and Phoenix towing says it's the management that does it. $300 just for releasing my car within the same hour, and this is the 2nd time this has happened, yet no other cars i see gets towed yet they claim there were others. Yes i have a stall, and yes i have a parking tag.<//review>

<rating>1<//rating><review>First off! It was stolen. I was in la and i got a phone call saying my car wasnt at the residency where it was parked! Which was around the time u already had the car in ur possesion. I called the cops from fresno which took a while to get to because i did not know what number nor have i ever had a car stolen before. I talked to pd told them my car was stolen. I gave them my info for the car they called me about 30 mins later and i found out where it was, which right after i called u guys. Told u guys it was stolen but u guys didnt have a. Case number and u guys picked it up as a stolen vehicle. So i called pd again to get one which was this morning got a case number to show i did not park it in that area I dont have a reason to lie thats so rude of u and fresno pd. I got the report and still u guys bumping up prices after the 3rd time i called? And no im not taking about the price change after 3. Im not mad or taking my hate on what happened at the company but the service you guys gave is garbage. Thats y i rated you the way i did.<//review>< Pics>

<Review>We finally had to file a complaint with roadside assistance because they were over 2 hrs late picking up our car. We had scheduled the pickup 3 hrs previous. Unacceptable! All they could tell us was that they were really busy and that we were still on the list. Hey, if you know you're that far behind you should tell the dispatch company that they need to find another tow company because you're too backed up. It's common sense and good business.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

unlawful tows.  they will tow a vehicle and NOT report it to local police to notify of possesion of a vehicle.  they perform "off the book" tows and should be investigated by the fresno police auto theft divison.  i have never had dealings with this company but i am a property owner that has been complained to about this company towing vehicles from assigned parking stalls because a unauthorized person called them to remove a vehicle.   they do not check identification nor do they follow general protocol in vehicle removal.<//Text>

Just an FYI to all public and towing companies. If you as a registered owner can prove that your car was disabled at the time that it was towed, then you should be able to get refunded for the towing cost because by law, disabled cars (inoperable or broken) need to get a 24 hour notice that it will be towed if not moved, per the CVC. I do agree that tow truck operators take great safety risks while performing their duties, however when it comes to predatory towing I loose all respect for them. At the same time, such illegal practices keep people in check but at a high cost to the registered owners. I mean $330 for a few minutes of storage is excessive, reminds me of "cruel and unusual punishment" in a monetary sense. I witnessed this company in question take my friends car very, very quietly in less than 30 seconds. I was amazed and late to confront the operator.  We followed it all the way to the tow yard, the driver said we would have to pick it up at the yard and not on the spot even though my buddy was willing to pay for the fees on the spot (road). Another point to keep in mind public, if you catch the operator still inside any apartment complex with your car being towed you have the right to demand the return of your car on the spot and without producing an ID or a DL per California law. The tow truck operator has to return your car immediately or you can sue them for 4 times greater than what the fees would be.< /Review>

Help!!! I was wrongfully done too! they took my car 1 hour after i parked it! it was a Dodge Neon green 1998 and i just bought it! i was on my way to get the permit in the morning when i found out it was GONE! i had to call the police to just to find out it was towed the night before! anyone with details about C.V.C 22658 and C.V.C 22500.1 my review is from a personal Experince. Not to mention according to this so called "Legal" towing you must give a 96 hour window before towing, yes i don't know about much properties but once i learn them im very good at it.  Read your own law before boasting about knowing anything. It is called the internet. people can Fact check you at anytime. Know your rights.< /review>

Just towed my car .. and I just bought my 2010 Mazda wasn't even able to wake up and get a parking permit so I'm in for a lawsuit and my car lot is sueing to...and my mom is a retired police officer so I have a lot of help</Review>
<Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1528221769704, 'text': 'Unfortunately your apartment complex requires that you have a valid parking permit visibly displayed before you can park in the area you were parked in.\nStaff called us to tow the vehicle because you didn\'t have the permit displayed - it\'s not like we "picked on you" - it is the rules for the property and they chose to enforce it.\nSince you haven\'t filed that lawsuit and I haven\'t heard anything further on this I assume that this has been explained to you satisfactorily.'}</Resp>< GmapID>

Outstanding food for the price. I would prefer waiter service or at least staff picking up empty dishes. But other than that - food is great, it looks and tastes terrific!
Design, location is wow! Store is wow! We loved it. And we had issues with included tips - problem was solved immediately. That’s why it’s 5*
Perfect. Would definitely recommend this place to everybody in LA< /Text>

The 16% service charge, 3% healthy LA fee, 10% sales tax all BEFORE A TIP, is 35-40% extra.

Keep in mind the statement says, ‘Entirety of the charge will be retained by the company’. So, I guess we still have to tip if we want to help the servers and the company keeps our fees?

A normal business model would have operating cost built into the price of food.

I understand a restaurant charging extra for a 6 course meal, but hard to justify when it’s a fast table delivery with plastic silverware.

Still arguably the best chicken schnitzel in town, but hard to justify paying $46 for a water and chicken bowl over lunch.< /Text>

Wow! Great place to eat!  ❤️

First of all I really like the design of the place, the plates and glasses they use ... everything is very beautiful.

Secondly the food is super special, I have never come across this type of food, very non-standard and served with a sophisticated Way. Everything was extremely delicious!  I enjoyed every bite.

Plus the service was great, the food came out fast and the experience was great.< /Text>

I really like the causal vibe here. I enjoyed an almond milk latte while hanging out with a friend at their patio. I wish they had a bigger space outside, but nonetheless it was great. Id like to try some items from their lunch menu as I noticed they make things fresh to order (unlike other coffee shops with packaged food).< /text>

You can't really reinvent breakfast, but my first meal there had me longing to come back. Everything was so refreshingly good. Highly recommend the potatoes, raw oatmeal, and avocado toast. The coffee was really excellent too and one of the best parts of the meal was the ceramics. Lunch is also excellent there.< /text>

Awesome space tucked away in Culver!! Great food and pleasant people working at the counter. Everything looked amazing, their gift baskets are awesome as well!!

Their seating outdoors is spaced well and looked comfortable as well as safe for all involved.< /Text>

< Review>
Outstanding in both taste and presentation. You feel like you are eating pieces of modern/abstract art. The sandwich with a special thick cut pork/bacon was amazing. Highly recommend it. The brisket was also perfect and tender and rich in flavor, with Asian tones, like the crispy onion and the glaze reminded me of Japanese restaurant toppings. Loved the refreshing mint yogurt ancient grain salad for a summer lunch. The cauliflower was very good but my least favorite because I wasn't a fan of the combo of parmesan shavings with almonds and cauliflower. Also the kale chips were not very good.<//Review>

Creative menu worth revisiting to see how they reinvent food- $35 breakfast for one latte, one egg w/mushrooms bowl and one croissant. I noticed after leaving that they charged a 16% service charge but I don’t know where it goes to, which others have commented should be advertised whether it goes to employees or not.</Text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>Tucked away in a secluded corner of Culver, Destroyer delivers a mouthwatering brunch composed of unusual, plant-centric dishes. The environment is curated, if sparse, with dining spilling onto the sidewalk and street for socially-distance friendly dining. Note that street parking is hard to come by, and you'll likely face a wait. Overall, I highly recommend this neighborhood jewel for a casual, delicious breakfast or lunch.</Text>< Pics>

It's a hidden gem in the streets just east of downtown Culver City. Let me tell you...not only did EVERYTHING TASTE AMAZING....PRESENTATION WAS BEAUTIFUL AS WELL!!! They have seasonal menus, which keeps everything fresh. I posted a bunch of photos so you can see how beautiful everything looked. Even the things I didn't know if I would like...I LOVED!!! The potatoes - amazing! The beef tartare - AMAZING!! The staff and service was also...you guessed it...AMAZING!! I strongly suggest to everyone to go here. The green juice was delicious as well. It was a great way to start off our meal while we waited for our edible masterpieces to come out! Enjoy!! :)</text>< Pictures>

<Review>Stopped for lunch on a Saturday and am I glad that I did... The food is very creative and tasty. Everything on the beautifully put together plate served a very tasty purpose. It is a bit out of the way, away from the hustle and bustle of Santa Monica or Abbot Kinney and that's not a bad thing. I will stop by soon to taste the other items on the menu.<//Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMt-r3asIT7bdMp89oqNOlxuheyo15RcratChWY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOEszq0eiEAarySJkxMxu-p6MEwRKwhntCkEwUW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMDE700PfAVey4uh79Q9w3eg97wgqF71-CdT3D5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMfFZifwDKIVOqFqKACPMWxFKrygL-U1ER33LJG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOaY1b3eUwkI6DxoiXOZYoTukXZe0QmOxSXoVI9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOw8bT53qejH4lIQuM8PrjDjf_Bl8wXvFfE-6QR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

A friend recommended this place and I ended up coming twice in the 7 days I was in LA.. EVERYTHING I ate here was absolutely delicious! The quiche was so soft and flavoursome, the vegan cookie didn’t taste vegan as it was so rich, the spiced bread Was not only beautifully presented but also tasted amazing and was so moist! And finally the winner for me was the porridge - I did not know  cold porridge could actually taste this good!! I will be back here next time in LA for sure!</text>

<Text>Food is not worth the price, they access a 16% + another 3% to the bill once you get the final amount, this doesn't show up, until your order is ready. I am ok with tipping  when you dine in and get excellent service, but not on take out orders. When you pick up your order, they have a tip jar at the counter, a little greedy. The pork bellly sandwich, the avocado dish, and the beets were good, the chicken was not good, not worth the price. We love Vespertines food and we're very disappointed with the Destroyer food.<//Text>< userid>

<Text>coffee & food are great, and so is the ambiance. But they only open at 9am, which feels incredibly late for a coffee shop, esp in a neighborhood where there aren't many other options. Would love if the owners could reconsider open earlier to catch the morning crowd :)< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80c2b99ab5148abf:0xe63ca4fce42691c7< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Overall fast service even with long lines. Seating can be challenging if you're coming in a larger party.
Minimal parking in the area.
We got the porridge with mushrooms, good flavors overall with crunch from corn and good mushroom flavors. There was supposed to be a poached egg but by the time I received it had hardened.
Got the tartar and thought it was underwhelming. Not bad but not something I'd get again, didn't enjoy the cream and tartar. Maybe if it had more pepper or stronger microgreens.
Definitely a hipster feel to it with decent pricing. Good for families and small groups. Good portion sizes as well which is why I gave it 4 stars, flavors were just not there for me.
Chocolate mousse dessert was good, creamy and in between a pudding and mousse texture with good balance of nuts at the base.

I have yet to find only a handful really good breakfast/brunch spots in LA unfortunately this is not one of them.< /Text>

Esp in LA where "creative cuisine" means BS avocados and pretty flowers on toast, this place certainly lives up to it's claims. I came here at around 11, the breakfast menu was still on. Got the spice cake and the egg. The spice cake was a great portion but nothing too impressive. the egg, however, man, that was a surprise. The quinoa was packed with flavor. Great presentation with warm stone bowl. I never knew eggs and quinoa could be cooked in such a creative way. Will definitely come back for it's lunch menu!<//Text>< pics>

<text>the place is very interesting and you should definitely check it out. however, be aware of the following:
* they provide plastic cutlery, which does not fit to the fancy design and food quality that the store otherwise intends to offer. besides the environmental reasons, It is also difficult to eat some of their food with a plastic knife, which downgrades the overall food experience quite a bit.

* there are a lot of hidden fees that are automatically added to the original menu price, which makes the costs very nontransparent for customers.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

I found this lovely cafe by chance and I am glad I did. The staff was very friendly and the service was too notch they don't play around they know service and quality especially the ingredients and the menu is my favorite part of this awesome cafe if you compare prices they're no different than your typical starbucks. I'll make it a habit to come to this cafe more often and, I live in the Valley. 🤘< /text>

Hands down my favorite restaurant experience in Culver City. I came for brunch with a few friends and they tried most of the menu. There were three vegan dishes and a couple more vegetarian plates. Everything was delicious and very original, tasting healthy and filling at the same time.< /Review>

<Text>Finally had a chance to check out this daytime-only spot which had long been on my bucket list. I hope that I could have their oatmeal as my breakfast every day. Their beef tartare was very delicious as well - the seasoning did not steal the scene but brought out the original and rich flavor of the beef. I was also impressed by the innovative roasted cone cabbage - it was tender and tasted wonderful. For dessert, it was a genius idea to combine chocolate mousse and cucumber sherbet.

It was fun to notice some recurring ingredients in their food, such as skyr ("technically classified as cheese, although widely regarded as yogurt"), almond butter, and a green powder that had a strong sour taste. What a pity that I could not try everything on their menu at one time. Look forward to visiting this place again.

Update: This time we ventured into the more uncharted territory of taste. The roasted carrots and blood oranges (dyed purple) had a refreshing taste of beer and I loved the ricotta at the bottom. As for the spelt porridge, I personally found the creamy porridge itself more agreeable than the bitter roast flavor at the top. Overall, I would not use a label of "weird" to dismiss the unexpected experience, and on the contrary I appreciate all the innovation and daringness embodied in these plates.

P.S. The pics sort of show how the dishes were initially arranged and what they looked like inside.

<text>Culver City is such a cool, post industrial live/work community. It's no wonder this neighbor coffee spot is such a gem -- delicious French pastries, homemade chocolate chunk cookies, Nordic whole grain rye bread with butter & jam, 2inch high quiche pies and "world beating" oatmeal bowls (if you go in for claims such as this)with shaved coconut flakes, almond milk, and topped with a liquid nitrogen frozen Skyr yogurt puck to add sour sweetness without a ton of sugar. Bonus, freshly brewed coffee & my go-to favorite roast flavor of caramel notes that underlies their espresso drinks.<//text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMjFFqjC5n9HeV0keExPLxtQ3arV5wkYcnShpRT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO07wiiS2p_dP8oNvXiU7dElwUEh6UnDUbF3oSl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><response>None</response><GmapID>0x80c2b99ab5148abf:0xe63ca4fce42691c7</GmapID></record>

<Review>My honest review. Food is great, but not enough for me to come back. I got the chicken confit and the roasted mushrooms arugula salad. Took a before pic and and after pic to show what’s underneath the surface. These were arguably two of the more popular dishes, and both left me desiring a little more. Snap peas were too crunchy for the confit? Roasted mushroom salad was lacking flavor? I can tell these use quality ingredients and a lot of attention was put behind each dish, so I don’t want to knock on em completely. Portions were incredibly generous (got both to eat myself, def couldn’t finish 😛). Space is very small inside, with maybe 3 tables? Best to go by yourself or with one other. Despite my sourpuss review, by all means, give this place a try, your experience may differ!< /Review>< pictures>

A regular spot for us.  Unique food experience that combines striking colors/visuals with unexpected flavors and textures. Chef JK knows what he's doing.  Service staff will never ask "how is everything" because if you don't like what you're eating, that's your problem.</Text>

Order inside and eat at the tables outside or on the bench. Be prepared to wait. Only open on weekdays but luckily they do takeaway. Definitely try the rice porridge and the beef tartare. I liked the simplicity of the chicken confit too but some people may find it too simple/bland. Recommend ordering the confit first and then moving to the rest of the dishes. Try the almond milk cappuccino, they make the almond milk themselves. Creamy goodness!< /text><Gmap_id>0x80c2b99ab5148abf:0xe63ca4fce42691c7</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I'm pretty sure I've visited Destroyer at least 15 times now. They just really hit the spot for creative, complex, and fresh meals. They have everything you could ever want in a brunch/lunch spot. The coffee they offer just further compliments the food.

So far, just rattling off from memory I've tried:

Avocado confit
Beet Salad
Heirloom tomato tartine
Beef Tartare
Chicken Schnitzel

Coffee:
Macchiato
Latte (caramel and plain)
Cappucino

If its your first time, I recommend a cappuccino (so you can experience their cute cozy cups) and either the beef tartare and the roasted beet salad.</Text>< pics>

It had a kale salad on top that was light, bright and full of citrus flavor that made it a nice accompaniment to the extra crispy chicken. The flavors were great and although it is a bit pricier than what one might want to it I will say they give you a big piece of chicken and everything was cooked magnificently.
Also note I went during the shut down and they are able to do their entire menu to go. The chicken stayed crispy even through the walk home!</review><pictures>None< /pictures></record></dataset><record>

The name of this restaurant conjures dramatic imagery to forefront of one's mind. Yet to my delight I walk through the front door and up to the pristine yet modest counter. The immediate vibe equal parts serene dojo meets reverent art gallery. So having followed the rise of Chef Jordan Kahn with keen interest I have waited to enjoy this eating experience, timing my future meal so I could selfishly soak it up completely on my own without interruption. I was not disappointed in the slightest. The line cooks and chefs are dressed reminiscent of the staff at the Masonic Marciano Art Foundation.

The kitchen takes up the majority of the space where you order with the menu projected on the wall to your right as you face the counter. Every piece of decor toward the window had the afternoon sun gently illuminating it stocked with deliberately spaced items in mason jars and vials, with their house made lattes, teas and kombuchas in the corresponding refrigerated display case that looked like it was on loan from Andy Warhol's Studio.

The serenity of space suddenly sprang into a harmonious orchestrated ballet once I placed my order; all to curious as to what would be their take on a Crispy Chicken Schnitzel. Truth be told, I was set to compare it to the one I have had at Spago Beverly Hills, as it is the recipe of Chef Wolfgang's Grandmother. It was an Absolute Night and Day contrast. The high end comfort food with generous portions harkins back to Wolf's Grandmother's dinner table, a true delicious classic. However, in line with everything Jordan Kahn has created thus far in his career his recipes and presentation are; what if the Tesla decided to reimagine food in a galaxy far far away. Mouth watering crispy chicken coated in salsa seca topped with herbaceous shaved black kale and bright preserved lemon. Immaculately presented center of plate with absolutely nothing out of place.</Review>

Went in to buy a black coffee and a very overpriced jar of pistachio almond butter $14 (6/8oz.) I'm sure they put way more almond in it and charge much more for the pistachio addition...

For the coffee to go and the almond butter off the shelf, the employee tacked on their 16% PLUS 3%  "Surcharge"....that's before 10% sales tax and any tip they almost compel you to leave! That's getting to 35-40% tax+tip on your meal.

Charge what you want for your food + drink but enough with these sneaky surcharges. The employee could EASILY have not hit me with the nearly 20% surcharge considering it was a quick coffee and an item on the shelf. Unfortunately he did not and I had to ask to remove the extra $5 which he did. They are banking on you feeling too ashamed to ask for the surcharge removal.

This is a minimalistic, pretentious, yet somewhat creative and incredibly overpriced small portioned (you'll leave hungry) restaurant run by people who think they are they second coming of Noma. I will not be returning. The coffee was quite poor as well.</Text>

How could you not love this place? Champagne dining on a beer budget. Absolutely delicious food. Little works of art. Delectable!< /Text>

If you don’t factor in the price, the food is five stars. I generally rate on value though. The rice porridge is absolutely amazing. So, so delicious. However the portion is pretty small and the price is about $17. The place itself is super adorable. A great place to sit and read as well.< /Review>

This restaurant is easily missed driving by in the seemingly industrial but trendy area of Culver City. Though word of mouth spread quickly about this hidden lunch spot, making it quite busy during the lunch hours 12pm – 2pm. Crowd quickly dissolves after 2pm, great time to come if you want to have a quiet lunch; or otherwise, come during breakfast when it is generally not that crowded. The Chicken confit which comes with heirloom grits, spigarello, and roasted strawberry tastes comforting with the strong chicken taste along with some nice twists from the spigarello and roasted toppings. I could not taste the strawberry that much, but tasted some roasted garlic which I assume was roasted together with the strawberry. The Namelaka is a chocolate cream on top of toasted almonds topped with I assume were cucumber iced shavings. Coffees are great and have a rich taste. The menu is en par with modern technological progress projected on a wall via multi-media. The restaurant looks neat and clean, and according to the minimalist style, only furnished with a few tables. There is more space in front of the restaurant to sit and on the adjacent patio. Parking is hit and miss and depends on the timing I guess. Overall, this restaurant is great to experience fresh and different food during your lunch time as a nice escape from office. The restaurant is only open Monday – Fridays from 8am – 5pm.

Update:

Raw almond oatmeal

Sounds simple but get your taste buds ready for a oatmeal filled of flavors underlined by a smooth note.

Icelandic rye bread with butter and preserves is served with a big chunk of rye bread making the dish pretty filling. Be ready to exercise your palate. Containing lots of grains and seeds requiring patience to chew. The rich, dark flavor of the bread demands something to contrast with which could possibly be something sweetish. However the preserves don't do the job being very sour.< /Text>

Best brunch in town. I'm going back for the second time tomorrow morning and I can't wait. Total experience. Worth it to go early in the morning. Seems to click a little better then. Super modern brunch food that's as much surprising as it is delicious. Too notch cafe and bakery too.</text>

We were really excited to try this place and really wanted to like it but it was pretty underwhelming. They have beautiful pottery and a fresh vibe inside, plating was gorgeous. The main disappointment here was the porridge with hazelnuts, onions and mushrooms. We think they must have cooked it in stock and didn't account for how much the stock would cook down... it was so salty it was close to inedible. Strangely similar taste to lipton's onion soup mix. Sunchoke soup was the saving grace of our order. Overall well executed but it wasn't enough to want to come back.<//Text>

< Review>
A breakfast and a lunch at Destroyer.
---
Breakfast.

Drinks: White tea & espresso

1: raw oatmeal, almond milk, red currant, vanilla

(Really F'n tasty. Multilayered. Best oatmeal I've ever had. I know it's "just oatmeal"... but it's not.)

2: icelandic rye bread, cultured butter, preserves

(The bread was very good and is so dense, it's a meal by itself. Not crazy about the butter or preserves since the flavor of the bread overpowered it. Salted Kerrygold would have been better and easier.)

3: organic hen egg, crispy potato, mushroom

(Oh man! This was really great. A real surprise. I literally have to dig into it. It's a treasure.)
---
Lunch at Destroyer...

- beef tartare, smoked egg cream, pickled mushroom, chicory

(This was really good. The sour bitter taste of the chicory was very nice with the smooth and cool beef mixture. It benefits by taking heaping bites!)

- roasted baby yams, avocado, yogurt, walnut

(This was subtle and fine. Pretty to look at and fun to eat. Nothing "spectacular", but it's a nice cool treat. I like the procedural process of eating it. Making "full taste" bites with every ingredient on your fork. Fulfilling.)

- bavarian cream, toffee, apple, sorrel

(Cream with apple sauce and sweet crunchy toffee. It's not much without the sorrel. So careful big bites help here. You have to build your bites because it becomes a big mess if you're not careful. Yummy desert. But it's nothing if any piece is missing.)< /Review>

<Text>Nice little coffeeshop that also serves pastries and a variety of meals. The latte tasted excellent, service was fast and friendly. This place is somewhat expensive but not unusually so for Culver City. The general style is Scandinavian which is reflected in both the coffee, food and interior. I did not try any food but it did look good looking at what others ordered.

Destroyer is located close to a hill with hiking trails and a visit can be conveniently combined. I would come back here.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x80c2b99ab5148abf:0xe63ca4fce42691c7< /Gmap_id></record>

Clever neighborhood cafe! Clean eating, sleek & skilled plating, SUPER approachable! Counter service concept is fast and easy. My husband and I did not wait long at all for service. Staff is friendly and experienced. Their raw oatmeal was fantasic! And don't miss out on the avocado toast either! Hats off to the chef!!<//Review>

<text>Destroyer was an extremely pleasant surprise for me. I thought it was going to be one of those cool hip innovative artisan restaurants with tiny portion sizes for an absurd price that I would go for the experience but leave still hungry and wanting more but the portion sizes were actually quite large!!

I think what really makes Destroyer stand out is the outstanding food presentation and the flavor combinations that are truly one of a kind. I mean never have I had rice porridge with puffed rice and burnt onions before, or mushrooms combined with arugula, spelt, and cheese before. The mushrooms and cauliflower were def my favorite of what I got and even with splitting this with a friend we still had plenty leftover that we were able to eat the next day!

I would absolutely recommend trying Destroyer at least once for the experience. The plating and presentation are gorgeous and the unique blend of foods should be more than enough to pique your interest. You can tell that each dish is thoughtfully created and presented and you can even see them in the kitchen carefully placing everything in the dish. I know the taste probably won't appeal to everyone but it still is an incredibly aesthetic and different dining experience.</text><Time>1582025448221</Time>< Rate>

Loved the porridge, cauliflower and the brisket was to die for. Probably the best cappuccino I have ever had. Topped off with delicious chocolate cream with almonds and cucumber (yup, cucumber). Space is small and on a rainy and cold day (California cold) we were lucky to have no problem finding a table inside. They take no reservation so try coming at an off peak time.</Text>

<text>We got a recommendation from a friend to check out this place.
Food was BOOM 💥
Super refreshing, many beautiful flavors and so much style.
My favorite dish was baby potatoes with poached egg - to die for.
Highly recommend
I will most definitely be back<//text>< pictures>

<Review>Their brand is a bit confused, is it "spacey", is it "hipster", and what do those have to do with a name like "destroyer" - I don't like that I like this place. Their latte is worth, and their ready to go kale salad is nice. You might order a piece of art you're supposed to eat on accident or walk out with a man bun but what I've eaten tastes good.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Good coffee, but bring your own sweetener if you want a non sugar option. Parking is a nightmare.< /Review>

<Review>Decent coffee, I like the style of the place too but parking is sometimes a pain. Lots of outside seating which is nice early in the morning when it's a little cooler. I got the Avocado confit(breakfast menu) which was seriously tasty, will come back for sure. @justanothercoffeeguy<//Review>< gmapID>

<text>The only positive thing about this place is the small seating area outside which could be nice when the weather is good. As for breakfast, well, if you think the various tastes you encounter in a dish should complement each other and, more importantly, believe that food also serves a functional purpose, namely getting your belly full and giving you enough energy to go about your errands, then don't bother. To be honest I'm not really sure what I ate and what was it good for!<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x80c2b99ab5148abf:0xe63ca4fce42691c7<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>I had the chicken confit and the "sparkling espresso"

First off this place has a great vibe. The confit was dope as hell and healthy too. Really happy.

Second, I have mixed feelings about the sparkling espresso... at first I was like "uwotm8?!??" But then  I warmed to it. It got sweeter the more I drank because the espresso was at the top. If you get it definitely stir first. I honestly liked it toward the end and I think it's cool this place experiments like that.< /review><rating>5</rating><Gmap_id>0x80c2b99ab5148abf:0xe63ca4fce42691c7< /Gmap_id>< Name>

Pricy. Well cooked proteins. Pleasantly presented. Unique flavors, but it's missing umph. I can see getting bored with the food very quickly unless blandness is your thing. Appropriately bitter tastes are there but there doesn't seem to have balance.<//review>

Another hipster place meant more for taking pictures and being seen than eating. The food was okay. I got a bowl which I expected to be something like a potato hash with eggs and it ended up being a bunch of boiled potatoes with egg sauce and a small amount of leaf on top.< /Review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>My partner and I established that this is one of the places we MUST take visitors from out of town to exemplify what a unique "LA breakfast/lunch spot" is all about.

This place is eloquent (not FANCY) in many senses. The food speaks for itself and doesn't need other bells and whistles.

The food is CLEAN, well thought out, and combines unique ingredients to create new experiences for your taste buds as well as for the mouthfeel.

Will definitely be coming back again soon.< /review>< pictures>

<Time>1577471581026<//Time><review>I had a disappointing experience at Destoryer. The restaurant is beautiful, the staff are friendly, the ingredients are fresh, the coffee is great, yet the food does not taste good. The chicken confit dish was strange at best ( I thought it tasted like oatmeal with chicken), the squash lacked salt and was not very flavorful, and the avocado toast was average. The chocolate croissant and spice cake we got for dessert were both terrible and we left them unfinished (as someone with a large sweet tooth, this is quite rare).</review>< Pictures>

I write for a music and coffee blog called Crooners In Coffeeshops, in which I interview local musicians at local coffeeshops. My writeup reflects the positive experience that I encountered at Destroyer on our interview date.

Word of mouth has spread through the Westside (as well as many a Los Angeles based food blog) about a cafe that serves delicious high-end bites for a relatively affordable price, and that cafe Destroyer. The chic, modern minimalist shop strives to bring fresh, organic, and homemade recipes to any guest that steps through its doors. Apart from the intriguing blend of sweet, smokey, and savory scents that graze your nose, your eyes will naturally shoot to its environmentally friendly projected menu, and boy, are you in for a treat.

Destroyer’s offerings include basic coffee options (espresso based drinks primarily), teas, and tonics amongst an impressive menu split into grains (oatmeals and breads), cold (veggie and light protein), hot (heavier proteins with healthy starches), and sweet (exactly what you would imagine to be gourmet dessert). I chose to go for a latte and the Spiced Apricot Bread, which was a glorious blend of fresh fruit, creme fraiche, and red currant. Believe me when I say that these meals are meant to be slowly savored, and if you’re lucky to nab yourself a seat in one of their coveted indoor tables, shaded patio area or benched bistro tables, jump on it and enjoy the journey that your tastebuds are about to experience.<//review>

<Text>Was so excited to finally have the opportunity to try this place as it is right near my work. I was a bit nervous as I've seen the photos online and didn't think the food would be filling. Was I wrong, the portions are filling; don't let the photos fool you!

At first glance of the photos on line, made me think the flavors would be minimal because of all the greenery. Oh my we're the dishes so flavorful and complimenting of one another. And, the presentation was so artistic!

I had the chicken confit with heirloom grits. This dish was mouth watering and worth every penny. I was a bit nervous as strawberry is a hard flavor to pair, but it surprisingly was paired nice with the grits and chicken. I was not able to finish my full meal. Ate half and took the second half for dinner. My coworker ordered the beef tartar and their pastries which the berry bar was my favorite< /Text><name>Sher Vasquez< /name>< Gmap_id>

We were recommended this place, and was it a fantastic recommendation. The place is small, and there is mostly only outdoor seating, which is great with LA weather. What amazes me the most is the food. They have a very unique menu with very interesting combination of ingredients. We decided to go for more of the meat options, and they were absolutely fantastic. The combination of flavors were very unexpected but in a very good way. They all also felt filling but healthy. I would definitely come back and hopefully try even more unique menus if they rotate their menu.<//text>

Love love love love love the aesthetic. This review is solely based on coffee and not food. I have coffee everywhere. Its really important to me. I tried two drinks from here and found it was the coffee I didn't like. I generally get a vanilla latte with oat milk iced. They don't have vanilla. They also only had mocha, chocolate and caramel. It's the espresso I didn't like. So much so that I drove across town to el segundo to get a cup I knew I'd like.

This is my personal opinion. It's so important. Especially because a small cup of coffee (one size) was $7.95. Also outrageous.  I'd never come here again coffee doesn't have to and shouldn't cost that much. I'm happy to pay that much however for a cup that I like. But in this case, I'm super disappointed. And again, this is my preference and opinion. I just couldn't get passed the flavor of it and it didn't taste strong.</review>

Destroyer is a solid breakfast/lunch spot in Los Angeles/Culver City. It's in an interesting part of town and the building itself is minimalism design forward. The menu is cleanly projected onto the white wall near the register.

My buddy and I ordered the avocado toast with burnt onion and a porridge with mushrooms. Both were unique and come out on beautifully simple plates. However, both dishes could have been salted more.

Overall, Destroyer was a good experience with a more healthy menu in a beautiful space.< /text>

<rating>3</rating><review>The aesthetics of this place are spot on. But the shocking thing about the food was how heavy it was despite the marketing behind it being so clean and healthy. We ordered the rice porridge and the yams.

1. The rice porridge was initially the better of the two things we ordered. Savory, creamy, with a tinge of saltiness. Not the most flavorful but honestly as good as porridge gets.

2. The yams were very very sweet. Not a huge fan of that dish. Will hopefully try this place again< /review>< pics>

Food menu is creative and the plate presentation is charming. The cups / mugs are pottery, locally made.

<Review>This place is beyond special. Food is beautiful, delicious, inventive, and completely unpretentious. You order at the counter, get a number, and find a seat. The staff checks in just enough to make sure you're enjoying everything. And you will enjoy everything. I feel like I won the lottery being in this area when Destroyer was open and now I have a reason to always return.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2b99ab5148abf:0xe63ca4fce42691c7</Gmap_id></record>

It's a chef zombie land. You walk into a small shop and have 7 chefs working and everyone has the same calming attitude and demeanor. This is not a bad thing, just feels like you are walking into another planet. They are def on the "mix fresh herbs" bandwagon and I love it. Herbs people didn't think would be edible especially raw and together they make work. I recommend the egg and mushroom breakfast with a ginger lemonade quaff .< /review>

Presentation and appearance is a big thing here, like on an artistic level. Picky eaters and close minded people will likely complain about it being too hipster, or weird ingredients, or weird textures, etc. The fact that they hate on it is in fact a good sign.
Their very limited hours is a valid criticism though. I, as well as many others, would go there more if open later and/or on weekends.< /Review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2b99ab5148abf:0xe63ca4fce42691c7</Gmap_id></record>

After many meals at destroyer, I think my 5 star review is long overdue.

The first time I had destroyer it was right after they opened.  It was scary how delicious it was, and how well oiled they were even in the beginning.   The dishes were beautiful, the drinks were crafted, and every single bite was perfect.

I've had a good amount of the menu.  My favorites are the chicken confit, all the beautiful salads, the beef tartare, the sun choke soup, and really just everything.  I haven't had a single bad dish and it's always an art piece.

Anyway Kahn definitely freaks me out, he's definitely an alien.< /review>

When you first walk into Destroyer, it looks like an over-sized coffee shop. Hold your skepticism until you have the food.

Everything on the menu is thoughtfully crafted and executed. I'm not generally a fan of beer tartar and the plate they have here is exceptional. The dessert was my highlight for the meal. Chocolate mousse with a cucumber ice and a crunchy nougat at the bottom. I would make the trip back to LA just to have that dessert again.< /Review>< pics>

This is more of an experience than a meal, but I like it!! Very light and healthy. There is an earthy note to all the dishes.

Sweet potato is a must (they keep the skin on because the skin is full of nutrients! You won't be able to taste much difference so just try it!) tip: eat the bitter endives with the sweet potato and then a bite of avocado for added creaminess!

Beet salad is good, plenty of quinoa and the burst of black berries in between the bitterness of the grain was incredibly pleasant, paired with the sweet beets contrasted by the horseradish powder sprinkled on top.

Spelt porridge was a bit too earthy for me, as in one mellow shroomy note! It was still good..I'd add a bit of ginger or sesame oil to add another contrastive element to it! Therefore, have it with a side of something acidic.

Then there are the dessert, which I heard was incredible by the table sitting next to us. This was my 2nd food stop so was too full to try. Can't wait to check it out again next time.

Tip: this place is located in a really cool area, great for taking Instagram photos so plan accordingly</Text>

Seems pricy, at around $30 for lunch + coffee + tip, but its the same chef as Vespertine across the street, so its surprisingly affordable for a Micheline Star luxury experience!

Always superb service, fast for what it is, and take-out is available (although the presentation is where its at, so I highly recommend dining in).

Limited seating, impossible to find street parking (you'll get towed ASAP for parking in the office lots around the area), so expect to park a bit far and walk.

Great place to bring out-of-town friends, as this feels "very LA".

Judging from the outfits the other patrons wear, this seems to be an Instagram hotspot, if this is an interest.

Casual or formal, no dresscode or judgement from the friendly staff.</text>

Destroyer is a strange and wonderful gift I stumbled upon. The space is small but there’s seating outdoors, and it’s neat to see the open kitchen, watching them delicately and lovingly create each dish. Everyone that works there is very kind and helpful. The food is phenomenal and beautifully crafted. I had the chicken confit, and I couldn’t have been more pleased. My coworkers had the roasted  cone cabbage and steak tartare. I tried some of the roasted cone cabbage and it was delicious. They create fantastic flavor profiles. We tried some of the breads, desserts, and tonics as well, and we were equally impressed. I can’t wait to come back, especially to try their breakfast menu.

Just so you know, you order at the front and they give you a number and bring it to you when it’s ready. The food comes out very quickly. There is staff walking about to get anything else you might need. If you order dessert you just let one of them know when you’re ready for it to be prepared.<//review>

Pretty awesome place to have a nice modern Nordic cuisine style breakfast or lunch. Do not expect a charming cosy setting or service, it's all about the pure food. Well recommended for European folks who want something non-us :).<//Text>

<Review>The food here is what LA foodies would call artisinal, very well prepared and presented. Small bites mostly, but very filling for the size, and reasonable cost.

The Oatmeal and avocado toast is probably the best I've had, very unique approach to Oatmeal.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Chai tea was delicious.  I ordered the chicken confit with heirloom grits and my husband got the spelt salad with roasted carrots and blood orange.

I would say the food here is over dressed.  There’s just too much going on with the dishes.  Instead of highlighting the quality of a few ingredients in the dish, the toppings and seasonings overpower the dishes and you don’t really get to taste the heirloom grits. If they’re heirloom, wouldn’t you want to highlight the grits instead of masking them with all the toppings?

I would recommend going for the cold dishes here since my husband really enjoyed his salad a lot more than the chicken confit and spelt porridge.< /Text>

<text>The food is beautiful and unique. The price point is very fair for a meal that is unlike anything going on currently in the LA dining scene. The only down side is the restricted hours, but if you can make it during the week you'll be greatly rewarded. (Hours have been extended since my original review)</text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

I think you need to try this.

It's only been open about 2.5 weeks as of this writing so they still have some kinks to work out in the service area but the food was really impressive.

Food - we split the beets (cold) and the yam (hot)  I hate quinoa.  I now love quinoa!  Toasted and fried sprinkled on some lovely beets with avocado.  WOW i was shocked and impressed with how this tasted.

The yam with caramelized onions was good but unfortunately far too salty for me.  It was still full of amazing flavor and I'm just having an issue with salt these days personally.  Lately when I think something is far too salty other people I'm with think it's fine.  So, I'm not sure I can ding Destroyer for this.

They have a breakfast menu live on their website and start serving lunch at 11.30

They are not yet currently open on weekends but hope to in another month or so.< /Review>

It's ok. Beautiful looking plates and no doubt it's creative, and some of it tastes pretty good, and perhaps the dishes they serve are excellent examples of their genre, but I just can't get behind cultured (aka. funky, spoiled) butter or an overly bitter pumpernickel.</review>

Some of the freshest food you'll have in LA.
Just not the widest selection (nor should they) and impossible to get a parking spot anywhere near it unless you work in the neighborhood.< /Text>

For the price it, did not fill me up. You gotta like variety and have a different set of taste buds.< /Review>

<text>The space is rad. the food is what you might imagine from a fine dining, high concept chef like Jordan Kahn for breakfast or lunch, but approachable in every way including price. It seems like it should be pretentious but it isn't at all, the staff is just very welcoming and warm. High quality people making high quality food in an cool space and interesting neighborhood.</text>< pictures>

From what I gather this place is mostly about the bread. Cappucinos were creamy but still strong and aromatic - motto bene. The breakfast options containing eggs are very rich. Don't let the vegetarian-ness deceive you. If I were to come back, I would certainly want to try the bread that's all I'm sayin'</Review>

It is stereotypical LA.  Very Fancy, small portions, and cool looking but Un-functional drink ware.  If that is what you are looking for, you found it.</Review>

(Translated by Google) I happened by chance, in that area there is not much.
I just had a coffee and a croissant.
The tables are outdoors, they told me that many who work or study in the area attend it.

(Original)
Ci sono capitato per caso, in quella zona non c'è molto.
Ho preso giusto un caffè e un croissant.
I tavoli sono all'aperto, mi hanno detto che molti che lavorano o studiano in zona lo frequentano.< /Text>
