This is the only store that my wife and I buy jewelry at. All of the employees are especially kind but most importantly honest. I would especially recommend Randy who we purchase our jewelry from exclusively. He is a expert on stones and gems and is a real straight shooter.<//Review>

I’ve had a terrific experience every time I’ve visited DeVons in Roseville. Everyone there has been helpful, courteous and informative. The new location is fantastic, as well.
A few months ago, I worked with Dave and Sam procuring a wristwatch that I had my eye on for some time. I couldn’t be more delighted with the purchase and I am very happy to have been able to work with a local business to find it. I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend them and will come back for any future wristwatch or jewelry needs. Thank you Dave, Sam and the entire team at DeVons!<//text>

Matt and Randy really do make the purchasing experience amazing at DeVons.

From purchasing diamonds as a gift to transparent conversations around my first potential Rolex purchase Randy really has excelled in every aspect of his role. Furthermore, Randy goes above and beyond his role responsibilities and connects with his clients at a deeper level than a salesman.

<Text>We were in town on vacation stopped in to browse as I’m a huge watch nut so I always stop at the ADs. I had the pleasure of meeting Randy. This was one of the best if not the best experiences I’ve had walking into an authorized dealer. Randy was knowledgeable and helpful and just an all around great guy. While I didn’t get the pleasure of buying a watch from him I would like to think a genuine friend was made. I look forward to returning and hopefully next time buying another watch.</Text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>{'time': 1617830202595, 'text': 'Great to hear you enjoyed a welcoming and professional experience with us!

My family of 3 visited DeVons Roseville over the weekend to check out their selection of diamond earrings. I am very pleased with the level of customer service that Tony provided us. He was very patient and took the time to thoroughly explain the differences between the variations of studs that they had on hand and left us feeling well informed of the investment we were about to make. After a few days of contemplation, my wife was set on which pair she wanted. The whole transaction was smooth and Tony made it clear to me that customer satisfaction was his priority. Eventhough we are about a 45 minute drive to this retailer, we plan to return here for other future purchases.<//Text>

Got tired of listening to the guys working to case about Bette Midlers recent sexual assault allegations. I stood at the counter for 5 minutes with 4 employees literally standing in front of me not saying hello or offering to try on a watch. As one of the only Rolex dealers in the area, I thought they would have some class. But DeVons Jewelers made the Rolex brand feel cheap today.</Text>

<text>I was looking for a new watch and walked into DeVons and unbeknownst to me at the time, was greeted by Matt, the store manager. Over the course of several weeks he educated me on fine time pieces and walked me through a lot of wrist watch history. I eventually found and purchased a Bulova Lunar Pilot Pro from Matt and I am enjoying the decision.

TL;Dr The manager Matt is extremely knowledgeable of watches and will take the time to find you a well suited watch.<//text>< Response>

I had a very good experience shopping for a watch.  Matt was extremely knowledgable and helpful in guiding me toward the correct choice.  The option I was looking for was not available for my wife, but he did go above and beyond to help me find a suitable watch for myself.  He also gave me some much appreciated information on how to track down my wife's watch.  All around a fantastic experience, I will definitely be back.  Ask for Matt, he's awesome.<//Text>

<Text>I visited DeVons this past weekend and was greeted by Randy who was helpful, attentive and listened as I described what I was looking for.

Although they had a great variety of ring styles, I had my eye on a few so Randy quickly showed me 4 rings that fit exactly what I was imagining. He explained in detail about the 4 C's and answered any questions we had. We never felt pressured to buy which was extremely refreshing.

I highly recommend Randy and this establishment.<//Text>< date>

Just had a horrible experience at DeVons. About a week ago my boyfriend and I took my chain to DeVons to be fixed, luckily I kept the beautiful pendant my boyfriend bought me last Christmas because sadly my necklace was not returned. The store called us when the chain was ready to be picked up so we made about a 20 mile trip out of the way to pick it up only to be given a completely different chain. The employee who helped us was very nice and apologetic but the manager she directed the problem to was quite rude and snippy. He was very reluctant to help us and told us we would have to give him a couple of days to reach their headquarters and then make another trip to the store. After expressing our dissatisfaction about the situation with an attitude the manager finally agreed to give us a similar chain; however, his demeanor and attitude was very snippy and he basically tossed the new chain on the counter in a rush to get rid of us.</Text>

<Text>After going to several other jewelry stores (3 to be exact) looking for a special gift for my gf for Christmas
The other jewelry stores I went to didn't seem interested in helping me
( maybe it was because I had my hat turned around backwards and hadn't shaved in a couple days I don't know)
The min I walked into DeVons I was helped immediately, I told them my budget and they showed me some very beautiful pieces that I thought was very nice for the price.
There customer service was awsome and they made me feel just as important as someone spending a million dollars.
I will never go anywhere but DeVons<//Text>< rate>

Dave and his staff were wonderful, the customer service is A1 at this place. I ended up buying a nice set of ear rings for my Wife in order to compliment the type of service this store offers. Customer service really matters to me or anyone for that matter and Devons have that in place.

Wishing your business the best!

I came in to find an anniversary present and I was immediately helped. Mike helped me choose the perfect bracelet that my boyfriend loved! I felt as though the process was very quick and easy and I am glad I chose DeVons.< /Text>

<Review>Helped me pick out engagement and wedding rings. I found out that my mother got her Rings here as well. The people are friendly and helpful. They go out of the way to make sure you understand what you are buying and the discrepancies in jewelry grading by the different agencies. Very accommodating with transferring purchase between branches.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x809b21d0ada571d3:0x6e16cc4462578a81</GmapID></record>

< Review>
Their selection of Rolex watches is almost non-existent,  with only 1 hideous day-date available,  the sales person was incredibly rude and acting as if no one can touch it  or look  at it.....
I just walked across the mall to Ben Bridge Jewlers, and bought a $22k Breitling ....
De Vons can keep their horrible selection as well as their rude staff</Review>

<review>Don't let the mall location fool you. Devon's is a venerable, full-service fine jewelry store. I felt the store manager, Tom Carson, really understands what the jewelry business is all about. He personally helped me design a unique new setting for my engagement ring to commemorate my 20th wedding anniversary without a hint of condescension or pretension.  He was a perfect gentleman. He gets it. The process of making a custom setting was seamless, but more importantly, an enjoyable experience. Mr. Carson was respectful and enthusiastic about working with me on my dream-ring design. It turned out perfectly and I am beyond thrilled with the final result. The jewelers like the ones at Devon's are hard to find.< /review><response>None< /response>< Pics>

Randy was the 1st person who respectfully approached my wife & I.  Randy immediately appeared to be very knowledgeable w/jewelry & more importantly, how to interact w/customers.  The last thing I wanted was a used cars salesman experience.  Randy was professional & provided a personal experience.  Randy's patients & respect is what ultimately made my decision easy on deciding where I was purchasing my wife's ring.  Needless to say we purchased a beautiful ring w/no regrets.  Thank you DeVons & special thanks to Randy.....

I have been buying jewelry for over 20 years and have dealt with most of the major jewelers in the greater Sacramento area. There is no question that Devons jewelers is the obvious stand out. They go above and beyond consistently time and time again.  From the management to the receptionist, you will get the same treatment every time... A welcoming smile and great attitude.  They understand the importance of special occasion jewelry purchases such as engagements, anniversaries, weddings, etc.  The quality of the jewelry and watches is phenomenal.  With multiple locations in the area, it is convenient regardless of where you live in the greater Sacramento area. I have sent countless referrals to Devons and almost every single time I get the same response...."Wow those people are incredible".  I will continue to purchase from Devons and send referrals because they appreciate my business.

Thank You Devons,
George</text>

<Text>I received my first ring from DeVon's Jewelers 22 years ago and have continued going ever since.  My family and I love the atmosphere, the professionalism of their employees, jewelry selection, pricing, repair turn around, but most importantly the report we've built with numerous employees throughout the years...Dave Hansen being one of many, whom we had the pleasure of meeting nearly 16 years ago, shortly after he first began working for DeVon's.

Mr. Hansen has always taken care of us at a level that definitely goes above and beyond.  A few years ago, we decided to upgrade my wedding ring after 13 years of marriage.  He took such immense joy and pride in making that happen, one would have thought it was his. :))  My ring is truly unique and was beautifully made, and I absolutely LOVE it!!!  We continually refer friends and family to Mr. Hansen for their jewelry needs, as we have the upmost confidence that they'll be taken care of in a professional and honorable manner.

I highly recommend DeVon's Jewelers as they're not just another jewelry company,  but extended friends and family should you be fortunate enough to really getting to know their team.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>My experience with DeVon’s jewelers has always been excellent.  I recently was in the market to purchase an engagement ring for my to-be fiancé.  Just as any buyer would do when making such a large and important purchase, I began doing research.  I had no previous experience in purchasing jewelry and quickly felt overwhelmed by the amount variations of diamond cuts, karat size, style, etc…  I found myself helplessly wondering to numerous discount jewelers and various national jewelry stores.  I finally visited DeVon’s Jeweler’s in the Roseville Galleria and was quickly put at ease by the customer service.  One of their salesperson’s, Dave Hansen, greeted me and asked how he could help.  I gave him some background information and shared my feelings of being overwhelmed.  He didn’t even try to sell me anything, he just listened to my story and my struggles.  Dave’s unpretentious attitude and eagerness to please quickly put me at ease.  He gave me a crash-course on diamonds and the different levels of clarity, karats, and cuts.  Dave didn’t try to upsell me on the most expensive ring, he was really focused on finding the right fit for my needs.  Dave asked about some of my fiance’s style preferences and then made some really good recommendations.  In the end I purchased a 1-karat, princess cut, engagement ring.  My fiancé was thrilled with the selection, and best of all, she said “yes!”

My experience with DeVon’s when purchasing the engagement ring was excellent.  I had such a great buying experience, my wife and I went back to purchase our wedding bands.  And again, Dave helped us pick out a great fit (price and style) that met our needs.

Overall, I would recommend DeVon’s to anyone in the market for jewelry.  Their staff is friendly, unpretentious, and patient when dealing with their customers.  Even when we have other business in the Roseville Galleria, we stop by DeVon’s just to say hello to Dave and staff.  DeVon’s is the best jewelry store on planet earth!  Go today!<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x809b21d0ada571d3:0x6e16cc4462578a81< /gmap_id></record>

Brandon is the manager and the guy always insures my bikes are in perfect condition when I pick-up. Not once have I ever had any type of mechanical issues in the dozens of times I've ridden. Plus, the bikes absolutely shine each and every time. Such a great feeling riding a bike and have all the chrome shine(especially when you don't have to polish it!).

It is such a rare experience to actually have an employee act like an owner that when it happens you notice. Kudo's to Brandon for running such a tight ship and actually taking care of his customers. I remain a loyal customer because of his actions.<//Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO6HrLEqqAIqiRLxCHBMDFbVL1Fr1Vo-GTOalSM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMItPP_aQVUffJsN8nZcQ35i_voNAAaUsF0glTQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNNm3Hwjs8XhkKeQ0aRaXouDCYOJ0Z18oKvH-Mx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOo7gXkww4SBvjZujJT-xLtbF2pXaeyTA07MQV0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPaop36cYD-KKqPL17LpKrghi64kZOwKyaIeSMk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80deaadd547029e1:0xb531f86378a96c02<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

A completely amazing experience! I'm not sure where to even begin, but I wish I could give them 15 stars for customer service and the overall experience.
- Ease of renting. 5⭐ 's. We decided late Saturday night to rent a Harley on Sunday. After looking at all the options to rent through different agencies we choose HDSD (EagleRider SD) because of the varieties of bikes, you're guaranteed the quality and assurance of riding a top notch HD motorcycle, plus all the equipment is included.
- In store experience 5+5⭐'s.  I wish I could name everyone in this store because they're all awesome! Down to earth, happy, helpful, bike loving people.  Brandon and Ryan are the reason we had such a great day.  Brandon handled the rental, did the service check, walked me through the bike from wheel to wheel, broke out a map and we talked through the route and what would enhance the ride, and got us out the door. He also checked us back in and we talked about the different styles HD is carrying as a comparison for what we rode   Ryan walked with us around the shop, pulled up maps on his phone, and made some suggestions to the route to make sure we had the most scenic ride possible.  No way we would have seen what we did on our trip without him.
- The bike. 5 ⭐'s.  We rented a Street Glide Grand Touring bike. It really doesn't get much better.  It handled like a luxury performance vehicle, no surprise it's Harley Davidson! We took the scenic route up to Julian and back.  Lots of curves, fast highway straight aways, and the ever present cross winds in the valley and we cruised right through them all with a smile. Lots of storage space, comfortable seats, my better half was in heaven on the back seat.
- Overall 5+5+5⭐'s.  No clue why we haven't done this sooner.  It's great to have the option to try out different motorcycles and away for a day or a weekend in a completely different way then driving or flying somewhere and there's nothing like the experience.  We WILL be coming back and when it's time to finally decided on a bike to call our own, you can guarantee it'll be from the EagleRider San Diego family<//Text>

<text>Stopping by Eaglerider to ask a couple question turned out to be a life changing experience for me and I owe it all to the manger there Brandon.After talking with him about Eaglerider I went right home and signed up.Since then i have had two great rides and look forward to the rides coming in the months and years ahead. So if you live in San Diego or your visiting and what to ride go see Brandon. You wont regret it !!</text>< pics>

This was the best experience i could have possibly asked for! Anitra Bottecelli was so much help and was able to dig deep to find the perfect helmet to fit my large head. First time ever renting and it went swimmingly. Thanks again!< /review>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>I have rented a Street Glide for the 4th time.  I never write reviews at first point of cpntact.  But I must say i am extremely inpressed.  Brandon is professional and very courteous.  He has answered all of my questions and even has gone  the extra mile to teach me about the bike and safety while riding.  Brandon wore a covid safe mask the whole time through all of out interactions.   He is an asset to your company and in my perspective has achieved all of the Customer Service skills to optimum preformance.

Great experience with quick, to the point, check-in & out, good rides to Mt Palomar & around, downtown attractions & Little Italy for suppers. Two days of predictably good weather & lane splitting when freeways had to be joined for connections.< /Review>

Ya gotta love being able to rent a bike in a different city and do a tour. Motorcycle riding is where it's at. But it's hard to carry a couple of weeks need on saddle bags. This is a good happy medium way of traveling and riding on the same vacation.</text>

< review>
While visiting from Germany my friend got a day off to have me ride with him in SD county. So I headed to Eagle Rider yesterday evening. I wasn't sure if the trip was gonna happen and a little bit tired after spending all day in LA. So Anitra told me to not sweat it if I'm tired and not 100% sure and come back in the morning. We wanted to start the tour at 9 and Eagle Rider didn't open until 10. However, Anitra told me that she would come in a little earlier to get me on the road. This morning I headed to Eagle Rider after my buddy confirmed and Anitra was there to attend me. She walked me through the process of the rental and took my data, German driver license and my card for payment. Made sure I knew everything I needed about the bike, some routes, and the return. We spend a wonderful day in SD county. I even got a new 2018 Fatboy, the bike I'm actually looking to buy. The bike was impeccable, the ride smooth. Came back at 6:40 PM 20 minutes before closing with a full tank of gas. Anitra was there for the return, as promised. She showed genuine interest in my experience and was very kind and professional. The next time I'm in town I will definitely come back here. Highly recommend!< /review>

<Text>I did not have a pleasant experience here dealing with Brennan.  I booked a street 500 Thursday morning around 5am.  They never asked me for my m license endorsement info.  I've been riding since 2008 but where I live, no one cares about that, so I only have a permit.  When I called at 1230 to tell them I was late (coming in from out of town) they told me i need an M license and there was absolute no way they could work with me.  They refused to give me a refund after holding the bike for less than 12 hours and Brennan acted all tough like he was the big boss there but couldn't do a simple return.  He pushed me that I needed that and that there was nothing we could do to get the situation right.  I'm having my last ride with my brother in law in the military and wanted to ride around oceanside with him.  I asked him if my brother in law could borrow the bike, I'll ride his and I'll return the loaner tomorrow.  He said no way and chastised me for not reading the fine print.

I should note that back in Chicago I have a 2019 street bob and had a great experience at Chicago harley.  Eagle rider is not a small business.  Telling me that he held the bike for me and that's why there's no refund is ridiculous.  12 hours?  With a full stock of bikes? Ok if it was a mom and pop operation I might see that if they only had a few bikes but dont tell me that someone was dying for that bike and you had no others.

I would give one star but they gave me a store credit to eagle rider which is pretty much useless to me since they won't rent to me.</Text>< Pics>

We rented a Harley for one day, coming in from Minnesota.   We dealt with Anitra and she could not have been more helpful about the bike itself and various route options to get the best ride for our limited time.   Best experience I've had at the many Eagle Rider facilities I've been to.< /review>

<text>I'm a frequent renter at Eagle Rider in Orlando, FL. This was my first experience at the San Diego store. I requested a glossy black Street Glide with a removable passenger backrest, removable back luggage rack, and electronic cruise control. I also requested a pick-up from my downtown hotel. Due to a canceled flight, I had to reschedule the pickup time on last minute notice. The staff was great, overall the experience was great. The pickup was fast and smooth. Sheri in the office was awesome. Docked a star because the bike they gave me did not have electronic cruise. Bummer, but a small thing at the end of the day. I will use them again. I highly recommend using there services. Ask them about the "smugglers run" (a ride Sheri recommended. It was a blast!<//text>< pictures>

This is an amazing membership program and I have been extremely impressed with their customer service and the overall experience. The team is very knowledgeable and helpful, the bikes are in great condition, and you cannot beat the price. If you are looking to ride from time to time and don't want all the hassle of owning a bike, this is the BEST membership you can buy. Happy riding!<//Text>

This was a great experience. People were helpful. I contact the shop before renting to have info about Supplemental Liability Insurance and they were happy to help. The team is very friendly, they gave us good tips where to cruise around San Diego and they are not there with a stop watch to check the second. The bike had some very (very!) minor problem and they were happy to be informed about it. This gave me the feeling they very much like to take care of their bikes to provide a good experience to their customers. I wish we had some more time to keep longer the bike. We had only two days (beginning of November) and made only a short tour: Sand Diego, Palm Springs, Borrego Springs, San Diego. My only feed-back is to consider to allow returning the bike later than 4pm. 4 pm fells a bit too "in the middle of the day".

I can only recommend the place!

Cheers,

Marco<//text>

Would give ten stars if I could. Best rates in town. Best customer service EVER. And the EagleRider program is off the hook--EVERYBODY should do it.

Got a great bike at a super-cheap rate. Had so much fun, and they even worked with us on repairs after we dropped the bike on the dirt.

Super-friendly before and after rentals. People there are excited about bikes and excited about you enjoying your bike. Couldn't ask for a better experience.<//review>

<review>Seamless experience from reserving the rental to returning the bikes at the end of the day.  They were in good shape, just what we wanted, and the weather cooperated.  The employees were uniformly helpful and friendly, and gave us the AMA discount without hassle.  This was the first time we rented a bike, but it won't be the last.  Highly recommended.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

Great service.  Got me in and out quickly.  They have a wide selection of bikes and are a great alternative when time constraints prohibit bringing one's actual own bike somewhere.  I will definitely use them again!<//Text>

<text>EagleRider in San Diego was fantastic.  They were exceptionally helpful and accommodating for me and my two boys when we traveled to Mexico on Harley's we rented.  The customer service was excellent, and the Harley's we rented were nearly new and in perfect condition.

< review>
I had booked to rent BMW 1200GS but in the day I left London for San Diego I receved an email telling me there wasn't one available. In short I did not  have an opportunity to do anything about it. I have to say that the guys at Eagle Rider in SD were great and managed to fix me up with a Triumph Tiger which is not a 1200GS but it got me going. My complaint is against Eagle Rider reservationsas they took my deposit yet did not deliver their promise. I would be very wary about booking with them again! Peter< /review>

If I could give zero stars for this company I would. They allowed me to rent a bike online, charged my credit card immediately and sent me a confirmation email with no language regarding potential inventory availability issues. THREE days later they send me an email saying the vehicle was not available. I had already made plans and it was a rental for a birthday present for my boyfriend. They offered no solution! Absolutely the worst customer experience I have very had. DO NOT RENT from them!<//Text>

I am a very frequent eagle rider renter, from AZ to NYC.  I went in here yesterday to reserve a bike and was refused service. The reason? "the staff was in a meeting." There were several employees working the floor, I guess we're all too incompetent to even remotely help me or take my info. They told me to come back later; not so logistically easy when you're on the other side of San Diego. This defies the definition of "customer service"
I rented from 360 Motorcycles instead who were more than glad to help me.< /Review>

With the service staff and the quality of the motorcycle in this store, I was very much satisfied. The staff is friendly, the motorcycle was in very good condition (I rented a Harley-Davidson). Booking in the internet and picking up the bike worked well. The gasoline fill level was approximately 3/4 of the volume and I was only expected to return it that way. Since I did not go to a gas station, I was charged a small amount of additional dollars, which is acceptable. I felt very secure and can definitely recommend this place!<//Text>< Pics>

Poor customer service. Called to confirm availability, 20 mins later I arrive, the staff was passive with me and just said everything was sold out. I would have appreciated knowing that before the drive. Also asked for any recommendations on other places, they said they knew none. Luckily another company I called who was sold out, recommeneded to to Rentys in SD.</review>

This is the worst service experience I have ever had with a dealership. The first problem is their phone system. When you call you are routed through the LA corporate HQ who in turn routes you to San Diego, but often gets misrouted to some other city or state. If you are so lucky to reach the right location, you will find the service to be confused, unmotivated and cavalier. I brought my Indian Chief Vintage in for service and they estimated two weeks and have had my bike for three months - seriously. What a drag dealing with these guys.<//text>

< Review>
We were greeted right away and the bike was ready to go in short order.  Sherry was great with all our questions and she got us on our way very quickly.  Much better service here than in the SFO office.  Highly recommend using the San Diego location for your rental bike needs.

We did a one way rental from San Diego to San Francisco on an Electra Glide from September  17th to the 20th.</Review>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>December 8th we were in San Diego and made a last minute decision to rent 3 Harleys for a quick 7 hour ride up and back to The Rock Store for lunch. We had an excellent rental experience with a very fast check in and out. As we were leaving one of our group was uncomfortable with the seat on the Soft Tail. They offered to switch him up to a Road King but suggested they first remove the passenger seat which he did not need. That solved the problem and he was able to stick with the Softtail- which is the bike he really wanted to ride. While we were there I noticed several bikes were getting backrests, racks and windshields added or removed to meet the requests of renters. It's tough to beat that kind of service and caring!</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

This was our 7th year using EagleRider.  We tour around the States and for this trip we chose the EagleRider in San Diego because of their positive reviews. From the moment I made email contact with Sheri everything went smooth.  She was very accommodating as well to a couple of requests I had.  The bike was waiting for us when we arrived and after filling out some paperwork we were on our way.  We had a mishap with the bike and EagleRider made every effort to have us back up and running by the next morning.  We appreciated their efforts and concern.  Sheri was more than fair with us in dealing with the situation when we came back.  The people were friendly.  We had a great time touring Southern California.  Thanks again EagleRider.  See you next year wherever we end up.< /text>

(Translated by Google) As part of our self-planned tour of the Western United States, we quickly decided to rent a Harley on August 3rd, 2014 at EagleRider. Unlike the hustle and bustle of Eagle Rider in Los Angeles and the long wait for pickup due to heavy traffic, I can only recommend EagleRider San Diego as an absolute insider tip. Nice welcome, very personal and friendly, our booked Harley Street Glide was unavailable due to a previous total loss. We were offered 2 similar machines, we chose an Indian Chieftain, and it was a good decision. New machine, top condition, easy handling. The return was completely relaxed. Super. We will be back.

Wir haben uns im Rahmen unserer selbst geplanten Tour durch den Westen der USA kurzfristig dazu entschieden am 03.August 2014 bei EagleRider eine Harleyauszuleihen. Im Gegensatz zur bei Eagle Rider in Los Angeles herrschenden Hektik und langen Wartezeit bei der Abholung aufgrund großen Andrangs kann ich EagleRider San Diego nur als absoluten Geheimtip empfehlen. Netter Empfang, sehr persönlich und freundlich, unsere gebuchte Harley Street Glide war aufgrund eines vorangegangenen Totalschadens nicht verfügbar. Uns wurden 2 vergleichbare Maschinen angeboten, wir haben uns für eine Indian Chieftain entschieden, und es war eine gute Entscheidung. Neue Maschine, Top Zustand, problemlose Abwicklung. Auch die Rückgabe lief völlig entspannt ab. Super. Wir kommen gerne wieder.< /Review>

Dollar Tree is consistently a good place to shop for every day items as well as seasonal items and greeting cards. Cleaning supplies and laundry detergent are available as well as dishware and kitchen accessories. They also have some health and beauty products, toys, craft items, and pet supplies. They carry canned goods, candy, snacks, and some beverages.  Shelf stable milk and almond milk are often available. There is even a frozen grocery item section that is stocked with a variety of food items. Dollar Tree's generic brands often have the identical ingredients to name brands for a fraction of the cost. Some of my favorite products there for value is their mouthwash that is comparable to Listerine as well as their soaps and first aid creams.< /review>

<text>I bought over one hundred products! I had to return 70 for personal reasons! Dollar tree does not do refunds or store credit only exchanges so I spent one more hour looking what to get when I had the products there was only one cashier and a huge line! When was my time to pay they put me aside and wait for the other cashier to come back from lunch. When she came back she started looking into the receipt and questioned every item, that took her about 40 more minutes! Dollar Tree made my day worse than it was.< /text><Name>Ulises Toscano< /Name><UserId.>113429254525899483633<//UserId.><rate>1<//rate>< Gmap_id>

The store is nice enough for the location. It's not their fault the shopping center's owner won't do more to encourage other businesses to lease here. But the store is rather clean, the shelves are always stocked and the employees are friendly and helpful. It's an ok store.<//Text>

Only rating it this low because of what I just witnessed. The manager at this location should not be managing due to the low patience she seemed to have with her employees. The cashier helping me out was new and her manager I believe her name was “Angela” was so rude to her as the cashier asked for help. It’s sad to see that. I’m a manager myself and I know it can get a little hectic sometimes but no one is perfect especially at a new job, as a manager we take the roll to teach our new hires great customer service to run a better business, and I can clearly see she was far from that. It really is upsetting that some people get chosen to be managers without earning it. Always put urself a in other people’s shoes.<//Text>

Usually a long line in the evenings.  I think they need to have more employees on duty so they can keep the store clean and lines won't be so long. But the staff is very friendly</review>

<Text>Usually very cluttered. The aisles need a good zoning. Carpet is dirty. Needs some air freshener.

I work at Walmart and I want to get a 2nd job here to help them clean it up and make it look better.

I give a 3 today cuz what i came in for was stocked, otherwise i would give it a 1.</Text><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80946660def2b84d:0x79612feda04599f0<//gmapID>< Time>

<text>I have been to many dollar tree stores, and every single one of them have poor customer service, not only do you have to wait in extremely long lines but they also have only one register open, while the rest of the employees stay hiding in the break room or wondering the aisles, it doesn't matter what dollar tree you go to , be prepared to wait in the long lines!!!😡</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Great atmosphere, table cloths, and cloth napkins. The price point was awesome as it felt like more of a fine dining experience beautiful plants were in abundance.We had the spring rolls, green curry chicken, and spicy tofu. Everything was delicious. Make sure to ask for the Thai spices if you like things hot!<//review>

<Review>The food and service was incredible! I love Thai tea and struggle to find a restaurant that serves good authentic Thai tea. I LOVE it so much I bought another one for ride home...IT’S THAT GOOD. Definitely try the drunken noodles or the pad thai they’re amazing! The portions are good to share or good for one person depending on how hungry you are. The owner was super friendly and makes you feel right at home. Will definitely be coming back soon!< /Review>< UserId.>

< Review>
We ate here just a couple of times during our vacation (pity!). The Pad Thai was one of the two best I've ever had. The Pad Kee Mo was excellent too. The Pad Woon Sen was good. Unfortunately they did not have any dessert, even when it was mango season.< /Review>

<Text>Very cute restaurant. And really really good food!!
We came here on a Wed evening. Lots of place available. Got seated at a booth, which was lovely. We ordered the Tom kar chicken soup, the poh tak seafood soup, red curry with white rice and drunken noodles.

The soup was beautiful. They added spicy chilli and peppers which was nice touch. The seafood soup was also very good. My brother took the whole lot to himself as his meal and still couldn't finish it. I tried the broth of it and it was pretty tasty. My parents LOVED the red curry. They ordered a spice level 3/10 and thought it was spicy enough for them. My drunken noodles were really tasty. I ordered a spice level of 7/10 and it was appropriately spicy for me. We also got a Thai tea which my dad said was good.

Overall, great experience and will be back for more!!< /Text><Name>Pranjali Sharma</Name>< date>

Great location in the heart of Coronado, yet the atmosphere inside takes you to Thailand. The staff is courteous, prompt, and very caring. The food quality is amazing, authentic, and flavorful with generous portions (including glasses of wine). Highly recommend!<//text>

<text>This is a wonderful place. Its unassuming from the outside, I even passed it at first looking for it. The food is amazing. I ordered the Tom Kar soup (shrimp, hot pot) along with the spring rolls and fresh rolls (shrimp). All were excellent. The inside is very inviting and comfortable, but on this day I had to take it to go. Service was quick and the prices are more than fair.</text><Rating>5<//Rating>< date>

<text>Food is decent. Customer service is HORRIBLE! Seems that Owner is the waitress. She told my friend that she has no time to wait for her order and she will be back in 5 minutes and she better know what to order. She was super rude at all times. she told me and my friends that if we have any complaints to go on Facebook and write them down and that she has no time for any complaints. Super super rude. I’ll no longer go there. Hopefully someone opens a Thai in the island soon!< /text><pics>None< /pics><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

I came across Swaddee by chance while walking the streets around Hotel Del.  The restaurant decor is real nice, representative of Thai art and foliage.  The servers are dressed in traditional garb and friendly.  Bathrooms are super clean, a big plus.  Prices are very reasonable and service very good.  The menu is pretty much what ever Thai restaurant offers - salads, soups, starters and entrees ranging from stir fry dishes to curries with one's choice of meat or tofu.  Food was just delicious.  It was freshly prepared and the spice level was optimized to our unique palettes.  Will visit again when in Coronado.  If you feel the urge to cool off after the Thai meal, walk right next door to Nado Gelato, another great hangout place.<//Text>

The food was decent. But... Portions small. The Thai Iced tea was tiny and 90% ice. I asked for the drunken noodles to be gluten free, and after the waitress brought it out she said the chef says, if it doesn't taste good, it's on you. Uh... What else...took forever to light heat lamp after asking twice. And oh yeah, it was my 6 year old daughter's birthday and they couldn't do any thing. Cake, candle, sticky rice....? Nope. Weak.<//review>

<Text>We've been coming here for about 5 years now and LOVE it. I noticed other reviews that said the service was poor however we've never had a bad experience. I always get the Gang Kua with just veggies, no meat or tofu with a side of sticky rice. Never fails to hit the spot. I've also tried the vegetarian spring rolls and the dumplings. Both were great. Friends that we go with always try different things and are never disappointed. WARNING: If they tell you it's spicy they mean it! I can usually hold my own but the one time I tried a different dish that was spicy the lady told me I probably wouldn't like it. She was right and I thought I was dying.  It is a bit on the pricier end. Expect to pay about $40 for dinner for 2 (drinks, appetizer and meals) but it's worth it to me based on the food, atmosphere and considering it's on Coronado. The restaurants there tend to be a bit more than I would spend elsewhere anyway.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x80deaccbff945b77:0x3e25c0c9d0c9d2fa<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Loved the spring rolls. Very fresh. Sauce was a sweet syrup with peanuts in it so it wasn't a peanut buttery sauce . The Tom Yum was very good. Had it with chicken and there was plenty of meat in there of you like that. I would have preferred more mushrooms. Spice was very nice on that - about a 3. The massaman curries they adapted perfectly to everyone's spice tolerance who ordered it. They easily accommodate requests (no eggplant, extra broccoli) for another guest. This will satisfy your Thai craving.</text>< UserId.>

<text>WORST COSTUMER SERVICE EVER!!!!!!!!!!! So Rude to my young daughter who read her receipt wrong and thought her tip was included. The woman who worked there turned the ticket over to look at the receipt and then started completely embarrassing my daughter and humiliating her and made her leave a tip. Said to her “this is no take out now leave a tip!”  Ive worked in restaurants and understand sometimes kids don’t can overlook or like my daughter misunderstand her receipt. If the lady knew anything about costumer service she should have nicely explained to my daughter the receipt and she would have given a tip with no problem! There’s nothing that excuses an adult to treat a child like that or talk to them Ever like that .. I even called to ask for the manager where apparently it was the same woman who said she couldn’t give me her owner or managers name.. had no care in the world what had happened to my daughter .. so basically that woman stole money from me..<//text></record></dataset><record>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>We spent a week in San Diego sampling restaurants and touring the city.  By weeks end alll four of us agreed that the Swaddee Thai Restaurant was one of our top finds.  We loved the bright decor and the staffs traditional dress.  The service was very polite and accommodating.  The food was the star of the evening.  Our son and his wife had the vegetarian spring rolls which were slightly overcooked but delicious.  The accompanying pork dumplings were some of the best we've ever had.  Each dumpling was moist with ground pork and an understated sauce making for 2-3 bites each.  The red curry, coconut with chicken, bamboo, eggplant etc was slightly spicy and perfectly prepared.  I immensely enjoyed the pad thai which I ordered with tender shrimp and was served with a healthy topping of ground peanut for added texture.  The bill was quite reasonable and a real bargain for the experience.  Wish this restaurant was in our hometown!<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

<Text>Honestly the food tasted like it was prepared hours before in hopes that someone ordered it. The service was ridiculous and at times almost a clown show. I've been to Thailand and I must say nothing they have was worth it. The food was salty.  I would have been better served at an outhouse.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

Pretty darn good I must say. Went here on a whim thanks to my addiction to Thai food and was pleasantly surprised. Saw the comments about bad service. I think it might just be a cultural thing since this place is legit. Go get some!<//Text>

Something has changed. We are local and been eating there for years. However, lately the food has been subpar.  We ordered spring rolls and dumplings and they where both cold in the center. Leading me to believe that they are frozen. Gross!  The table clothes are dirty and the service is no longer friendly. Unfortunately we won't be going back.<//Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>The good thing about Thai food, is now I know how it's all made and I'm a much better judge of things since I took a Thai cooking class. My first experience of Thai since that class and I really tried to use my palate to sense the subtle variances in each restaurant. First of all décor is light, simple, clean and neat. They use white table clothes and serve on porcelain dishes. Each table has fresh flowers on it that really let you know they care. The pricing is very competitive, unlike many places on the island that are not with similar establishments off the island. Not a bad place to take a date as there is plenty to walk around and do afterwards in the area, gelato shop called Moo something is my suggestion.

Tom Ka soup seemed to be more clear than expected, but just the right amount of sour from the tamarind. I prefer the rounded out taste of black/white pepper to some people who add hot pepper to their soups. I also prefer the minimal bamboo shoots, which as many know if not cooked/soaked properly can be little daggers.

Pad Si Eew had tender beef and succulent broccoli, but I found the noodles to be a a little broken and the sauce to be a tad burned, which is weird because I found the soy they used to be saltier than most sweet soy's and I'd imagine the burning was from the sugars. Nice size for 1 person, but I've got a healthy appetite and I went with the Green Curry which was thick and hearty, needed very little rice to compliment it. I went with the 5 spice level and it was tame, I prefer a measured scale rather than the exponential type which I feel is meant to deter people from over spicing, but hard for us who like and can handle spice to accurately judge.

As good as a thai iced tea is the real business is in the coffee. Yes I understand the price can be off putting, but it's really not pricey for the quality you get and it's been so engrained in us that Asian food is usually cheap. The average person can't appreciate the scale of good to bad and fine dining isn't exclusive to Italian and French and things you can't cook. We're so accustomed to getting $6 pad thai in a slightly large portion, but doesn't taste homecooked. So when you see a restaurant serving high quality Thai food in a better than average setting you seem blown away at paying $15 for that. You could go to outback and get a mediocre steak for the same price and not skip a beat, but proportionally bad is that compared to Ruth's Chris or Mortons.< /text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

I pulled in on the side street side to see if I could get an alignment and somebody shouted for me to pull around to the front side of the shop. Once I did, another guy complained about me pulling in on that side and asked who told me to park there as if I would know the name of the other employee who originally directed me to move my car there. I just backed out my car and left. Somebody had referred me to go there but I couldn't make it past step one (parking my car).<//review>< pictures>

Great service always!   My husband and I have gone there for years. We love their prices and quick friendly service. We buy used tires and have had tire repairs. We have never left there unsatisfied.  This is the only tire place I feel good going alone because I know they will give me a fair price.</Review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>Edie's tire shop saves the day! I popped in here on a Sunday morning after not being able to get air into the tire on our Mercedes Sprinter. Brand new tires and gas station air nozzle would not work. They said there might be an incompatibility... But it did work for a different tire. Anyway no matter what I did I could not get that nozzle on to that tire. After trying I even let out about 10 psi. We were getting ready to go on a road trip so this now constitutes an emergency... Google to the rescue! Nearest place I can find was Edie's tire shop. I pulled up the guy was working on another vehicle I told him what was going on he grabbed his air hose and promptly top off all the tires no problem! He said no charge but I tipped him anyway because he did save the day. If you're ever in Northpark and need something for your tires this is a legit shop.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

<text>They don't have a huge selection but their price and on demand style service makes this place worth visiting.

A great place to go if you're looking to have cheap tires thrown on. This place is locally owned and looks shady but they do sell tires at an excellent price.

They pretty much forced me to pay cash by saying their card machine wasn't working (complete bullshit). I strongly suggest you bring cash to avoid a confrontation about payment methods.<//text><Rating>5</Rating>< Time>

<Review>Friendly and affordable! Service is personal and the mechanics are a jack of all trades and can fix just about anything. I compared the pricing for a rear shocks replacement Eddie's tires: 50$  Pep Boys 250. I think the choice is clear.</Review><Response>None<//Response><rate>5<//rate>< Gmap_id>

<Text>I came to get an alignment. I was quoted as price. Then was told I needed to pay more to fix an second issue. I said no thanks I'll just take it to the last guy who messed up the car on the first place the day prior. I was then told that I still had to pay because he took the time to prep the car for the alignment even though he did do anything yet. I told him I wasn't going to pay him for a job that he didn't even start. I will never come back. I would never recommend this place.<//Text><Time>1481583018773<//Time>< Resp>

<time>1385405036291</time><Rating>4<//Rating><text>This place looks like a hole in the wall but the service is really good. I called them ahead of time and let them know I was coming. The guy quoted me $50 for an alignment and tire rotation and I made sure to get his name. When I arrived I asked for him and he knew exactly what to do. Make sure you get the persons name that quoted you the price otherwise when you get there you might talk to someone else and they might quote you full price. For example it would have cost $60 for alignment+$15 for tire rotation but I got it for $50 total because I called ahead of time.

Only down side is there is no waiting area just some benches outside. I went and got a soda from the market across the street and came back and they were pretty much done.< /text>< Pictures>

Serving San Diego with honesty and integrity since 1989 is what their website announces! My experience here certainly did not meet that slogan they have.

If you need used tires, there are some good shops around. Especially the place next to this place is amazing (see reviews by searching tires shops on the maps).

Coming to the reasoning behind the 1 star is that this place almost locked me up in their small office while overcharging me as part of dishonest business practices. I was quoted $70.00 (over the phone) for 2 used (but still intact) tires. One I walked in, the price was suddenly $80.00 out the door for two used tires. Pretty good deal you would say until I had to pay..:

Once they sticked my card into the chip reader in a cramped( office?) room, the guy suddenly pushed in 3 digits in instead of 2; that's where I noticed that something did not seem quit right.

My guts were right as the guy was nonchalantly charging me  w/o the heads up an additional $20.00  for removing the locks?
-WOW-
It would've been ok if they told me that they would charge another $20.00 for doing that, but no communication about extra charge whatsoever. "Are these prices posted anywhere? "Not that I have seen..

I strongly got the feeling that they were trying to overcharge me just for being "foreign" (from Europe) to them instead of a Hispanic person (which were just like the shop owners as well as the patrons present). I think they shouldn't pull such strings on people out of the blue and think that we won't care.

Will not come back, as they stole my money without informing priorly.  management practice. Most workers here are really friendly however and they are just doing their job.

Furthermore, There is no seating or specific waiting area as well, so it made our whole experience a bit awkward by blocking constantly the worker's way in the rain-ish weather.

Oh well, next time the place next door. These guy simply will rip you off! The  neighborhood is a rough one as well so imagine standing there on almost the sidewalk.....< /text>

<Response>None<//Response><Rate>5</Rate><text>(Translated by Google) These canijos are fast and effective. 3rd time I am a customer and customer service always very satisfactory. In Firestone, even if you have insurance, they don't want to cover it. Don't forget to tip for the soda.

Easy, laid-back vibes; nice crowd. Not loud or pretentious. Tim the bartender is amazing and the VIP martini is made with pineapple infused vodka, which is to die for!!!<//text>

There’s a man playing a piano on Friday nights. He plays the classics.  I love the ambiance. There is a nice chandelier and the music is not too loud. I think it’s the classiest bar in PS.

This has some very good charm.  Mark's singing old classics give this place a unique old school charm.  My suggestion is not to lose this fab singer/piano player.< /Text>

Such a friendly and relaxing bar.  The new owner has made some really nice upgrades (chairs, video screens, etc.) and the piano music was a great pleasure Thursday night.  Attracts a nice crowd of friendly and welcoming patrons.  A unique bar that sets itself apart from the rest on Arenas!<//Review>

This is a 5 star place for those like a relaxing time. Live piano music and you still can have conversations.  The staff is excellent.  Happy priced drinks at $3 wells are more than adequate.<//Text>

This is a great bar and a wonderful, overdue, addition to the bar scene in Palm Springs. It's a small, intimate space with carpeting, chandeliers, and cool deco-style wallpaper. There is a piano entertainer 5 days a week. Stacy's has lowered their prices and run an all-day happy hour from 10am-8pm.  Nice relaxing atmosphere and can can quite lively around the piano some nights.</Review>

Disappointed as  2 weeks ago, same time of the evening, ordered Amaretto Sour $5.00, today,, same drink, same time & weekday as last $11.00 this time.  will not do that again! One draft beer $5.00. No more Stacey's!! So far highest prices on Arenas!! Tried it again 6/14/19, new owners. Ordered drinks happy hour, didnt ask to cash out till later, talking with friends, charged $9.00 for rum & coke happy hour price. Never again!!!!! Not good!!!!!!!!  I'm done!!!!!!! RIDICULOUS!! ANY other bar than here! I totally don't understand the 4 or 5 star reviews. Bad prices, service blah.... I did not ask for topshelp alcohol. Price was just doubled!</text>

We do offer well amaretto (a well price) and Amaretto di Saronna (a top shelf price).  I wonder if you got one of each on your 2 visits.  Oh, and we have lowered our prices if that makes any difference.  Maybe if you give us another chance, we can do better.\nStacy'}</resp><gmap_id>0x80db1ba41f603929:0xb400e1e334b53c26</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Pleasant space with friendly bartenders.  I only have two real complaints, both relating to the fact that it's very hard to socialize with friends.   1. The seating inside is at at least 4 different heights....super low sofas, high stools, low stools, medium chairs... all different.  You wind up talking to someone's belly button, or they into your knees.   2. The audio from the pianists (which are quite good, btw) tends to be over amplified - usually  much louder in the front of the bar than right at the piano.   I would suggest more present at the piano where people want to listen 100%  and more background in the front and outside where folks want to be more social.  All that said, it's nice to have a real piano bar back in the neighborhood.</review>

I was having a rough morning, until I went to Bymar. I began the morning trying to get one tire changed at a Just Tires in Irvine off of Jamboree. They left me standing out there past the opening time, even though we made eye contact, and I just had to wait there patiently. Once they finally opened the door, they were extremely rude and short with me when trying to buy a replacement tire. As a female, I often have a bad experience when it comes to anything automotive so I wasn’t surprise. I left there feeling insulted and low, which is when I decided would never return there.

I had my husband call around to find a place closer to home, and he found Bymar. The experience was night and day; they were welcoming, kind, did not keep me waiting, showed me the tire they were replacing and why, and the pricing was fair. Moving forward, this will be my go to for tires and I will recommend them to others as well. They were professional and the tire feels great while driving.

On a side note, their bathroom was extremely clean and they also offered fresh coffee for customers. Thumbs up for Bymar!<//Text>

I've been coming to Bymer Tire for the last few years and was referred  by Brandon who was manager of a Porsche repair shop nearby. Am I glad to find here & Rob? He's very honest and straight forward as Brandon, and his prices are very reasonable. The quality of workmanship is excellent. I'd like to keep quality tires for my car which is essential for safety. I've already purchased two sets of high quality tires and am very happy with how they take care of me. Thanks Rob & Mike.< /text>

I had tire that was low and didnt know what a repair would entail. I stopped in, they took me quickly and fixed the tire, saving me a bunch of money. They could have easily taken advantage of me but instead took the best care of me. They are honest, genuine and kind. I highly recommend!!</text>

Bymar is awesome for tires and brake work.
I drive large commercial trucks with dual rear wheels and 4x4. I had vibration and alignment issues for many years.
Rob, Mike and Ed have always made great recommendation and now 2 years later my truck is still running smooth like new again and the tires are all wearing evenly with no issues.
I have sent my mom, aunt, brothers, and friends here over the years. Everyone has been very satisfied with prices and results.  I highly recommend this friendly, family business.  Many thanks for all of their expert assistance.

Went in with brake pulsation.  Turn out to only needed machining ofcthe rotors.  They could easily have told me I needed a full brake job that would have been three times the cost.  I've been going there for years and highly recommend them.</Text>

<Review>There are few placed left that are original owners..  I have used Bymar for 20+ years for all my tire and brake needs.  They are totally honest, never recommending more than I need.  They are very helpful  answering my questions and their pricing is always competitive.  I have absolutely no incentive to go elsewhere.</Review>< pictures>

Awesome, know what they are doing, prices are extremely competitive, and they will always give you options. I heard about these guys ten years ago. I asked everyone in the waiting room how long they have been going to Bymar and the answers were 10-11-and 16 years. WOW. That said everything I needed to know. They say it's hard to find a good wife, but finding a good mechanic is even harder. I highly suggest. Feel free to contact me for a reference.  Kevin L<//review>

Called to inquire about getting tires mounted, I already had the tires and wheels and just needed a mounting and balance.  When I asked about appointments and availability for the work I was rudely interrupted and told that they will not make appointments for "other peoples stuff".  I was given an option to drop them off and they would take 2 hours to mount them and then I was hung up on.  Terrible manners to a potential customer and awful way of doing business.  They apparently will only be nice to you if you buy from them.<//Text>

<Text>Tremendous folks! I've purchased three sets of tires from Bymar -- all at the best price I could find. Today's service topped them all: I called about patching a tire with a metal object stuck in it. "Sure, bring it in. We'll look at it right away" was Bymar's response. I was very pleased to learn that not only did it not make a complete puncture, so no repair was needed, but they also put more air in my spare so that danged TPMS light finally went out. And, "No charge -- air's still free!" was what they told me.

I will NEVER buy a tire anywhere else!<//Text>< Time>

Horrible McDonald's! Fry's are always either way too salted or cold. They don't put ice in the drinks so it's warm by the time they give you it. They never change their gloves after handling other people's food. Mcdoubles are always poorly made and smashed when you open the wrapper. And they take forever to take your order even when there is noone in line. Never come to this McDonald's it is terrible!!< /Review>

my kids love the McDoubles I love the fries even though the fries are $4 for a large that drives me crazy but I can't help it we get food there three four times a week it's cheap and it's amazing......... Maybe we can get McDonald's to lower the cost of fries that would be amazing......,👍</Text>

Worse customer service ever. Has to go back to the counter 3 times because of missing items in our order, the 3rd item, finally said he'll with it because it wasn't worth it to stand in that line again. Shame on you McNoMore<//Text>

(Translated by Google) Hello greetings to all the truth I want to tell my experience about McDonald's on August 14 I went shopping at Walmart and Finishing shopping my child asked me for mcnuggets and asked me to give my cell phone iphone8plus while they gave me the order my husband and my girl were at the table always as usual I lend him my phone in that they had given me the order my husband gave me the baby he told me you go ahead and I left he thought the boy had the phone when he got it off the table I do not know what gave me to think that we did not have the phone and we had come home in the blink of an eye he went back to look for it to see if he could find it but I ask nothing in advance please if someone has seen my iPhone 8 cell phone Plus be so kind to return it and I will give a reward Thank you very much

<Rating>1<//Rating><review>***Update this review is for the 11th Ave Location, not 12th Ave.

I called this location at 12:45 to see if they offered shampoos and styling. They said yes and that there was not a wait. Drove to the store and arrived 10 minutes later and they were closed (for lunch I assume). There was a sign that said they would not be back until 1:30. If they were stepping out of the salon they should have mentioned that over the phone. Very unprofessional. Not to mention that they jacked up their prices because of covid. They now charge an extra 4 dollars in addition to the fee you pay for your hair cut "because of covid."<//review>< Pics>

< Review>
Called 45 minutes ahead to get on the list, but still waited almost an hour. Showed the stylist a picture,  but she cut it about two inches shorter than what I asked for. Grateful that my hair grows fast.< /Review>

<Text>Checked in online and got here with 3 people waiting, who also checked in. Then a mother with two children walk in like 10 minutes afterwards. 3 other people were waiting before them also checked in and they serve the mother and children first.

Not trying to be rude, but being a mother with two children that are old enough to behave themselves shouldn't get a front of the line pass. Not sorry. 3 other checked in people were waiting first, so serve them first next time. Thanks.<//Text>< Pictures>

I placed appointment online, walked in and within minutes my son was called up for a haircut cut. Staffing was nice and moving fast, taking care of their customers. Overall my son walked out with a fresh cut< /text>

Clean and quick if you get there right when they open. Make sure to utilize the app to check in before you go. The staff seems genuinely interested in focusing on just you while your hair is being cut.</review>

Horrible, even when you make an appointment, they still attend walk-ins before you. Waited for over an hour work an appointment. Never going there again.<//Review>

Most expensive haircut I paid for a men's haircut and it was bad.  Left an indent on the side of my head.  Hair cutter had an attitude like asking for plastic gaurds is so outrageous.  Then tries sounding smart while clipper is next to my ear</Review>

< Review>
My friend went here and they didn't listen to what she wanted them to do first off. When she went back the same day the next week they told her the week had ended the day before which was only 6 days. They also made her wait until 5:30 to come in and talk to them, which is right before they close. They wouldn't fix her hair.</Review>

They girl left my hair choppy... I didn't notice it till I got home and style my hair... She took off more from one side... When asked her even it out...and I tipped her😒  I wish ppl that we're going to go into this profession would indefinitely know what the hell they are doing! It's just sad that do many ppl cringe when you say hair cut, cuz more ppl than not, come out of a salon or establishment unhappy with their haircut... It's pretty sad. Plz put down those shears... Not everyone is cut out for the job.. no pun intended lol.<//text>

< Review>
Horrible business practices. I checked in at 9am for a 10 am appointment. Showed up at 950am, to be early, let them know my name and after they verified I had an appointment I sat down. It was busy with 2 families and multiple kids.

At about 958am a lady walks in with 3 kids. Proceeds to the front and talks to, whom I can only assume is, the manager.
She tells her some sob story about her poor time management skills and next thing I know is one of her kids being ushered into one of the chairs. So I was like "ok one kid cutting is not too bad" as there were a total of 4 hair dressers in. Then when the other hair stylists were finishing up the mom was told that her other kids can go sit.
So I ask politely what is going on, that I had an appointment at 10am and it's already 1015. I was informed that I would be seen after they were all done and taken care of.
Finally after forever of the kids and their mom getting a hair cut there is a spot open.

So I stand up, because my appointment was past due, and at that moment some young guy comes in. The lady that was free apparently knows him as he goes straight to her and then she leads him to the chair and starts to prep him.
I was appalled and began checking the appointment times of other hair cutting places. Unfortunately their next available appointment was not for another 30 minutes so I stayed as surely I was next. One of the other hair stylist was done and told me it was now my turn.

I informed the lady what stye I wanted and just sat quietly in my chair while she did my hair.
When the hair cut was done and I was paying I let her know what was on my mind. I told her that they had a horrible business practice. I told her "piss poor planning on someone else's part doesn't equal to me getting delayed. Just because someone else can't properly manage their time doesn't mean my time should get messed up".

Time is money and mine got robbed. I will never again be a client at a location where they don't respect a client's appointment.  If you have an appointment then it should be honored. Or, at the very least, asked if it is fine that they take care of someone else. They just assumed I would be fine with being screwed over. I was not fine at all.

If you know a hair stylist or suck at managing time then this place is perfect for you. However, if you have places to be and other appointments to attend to then stay clear of this location. They don't respect your time, they don't respect your appointment.

As such I am taking my business elsewhere to a place that will respect my time.< /Review>

He was knowledgeable and fair. We couldn’t ask for more from a salesperson, and my wife and I wouldn’t hesitate to work with him again. Our experience with the loan officer is a different story, however. I understand the importance of making a sale, but one must know when a sale cannot be made. I had to turn down add-on options 5 TIMES before the conversation changed. I was scolded for refusing any add-on services, and was told my CPO warranty would be voided if I did not come to the dealer. While I understand the value of dealer service, I do not appreciate being played for a fool. I wish I could recommend Audi Pasadena without hesitation, and for James’ sake especially, but that just isn’t possible after our experience.</review>< Gmap_id>

As usual Audi Pasadena has come through for me again on a beautiful new Audi Q5.
This is my third one through them and David Carter my sales person is the best!
He went out of his way to find me what I was looking for.  White with light interior and ventilated seats.

I highly recommend Audi of Pasadena!

<review>I came in contact with Fausto when we were shopping for our new Q7. Unlike other sales people at other dealerships, Fausto and I were able to get to the point and came to a $ agreement. Once that was squared away, he had to get us the car. It took a few days for him to locate one, but he was able to get us the exact car for which we were in the market.

He made our car shopping experience seamless. Once the car was on the lot, he called us to pick up the car and finish paperwork. We were in and out within 2 hours--including the 30-45 min technology walkthrough. The team offered us maintenance packages and all the add-ons, and when we declined, they did not push us on it--something I appreciate and something not all dealerships do.

In all, our car buying experience was great. It was seamless, and Fausto made everything go smoothly for us. He was very personable and friendly, and we shared stories about our families. We also had quite a few laughs.

Thanks Fausto - hope you see this - and we look forward to connecting again in the future for the next car.

<Text>I just bought the most beautiful Audi and I am very happy with this car and the deal I got. Audi are making great vehicles and this dealership knows it by letting them sell themselves. Ivan was a very proffessional and patient salesman and just let us take our time, and try as many cars as we liked. He was very personable and honest and excited to show you all the features on these cars. No pressure just like taking a friend along to buy a car. He just wants the customer to be happy with their purchase.. and we are.</Text><userid>117721134135082654325<//userid><username>Damon OBeirne<//username>< time>

Ivan did a great job and really worked for my Wife and I to get us a great deal on our new Audi Q5 Plug in. The experience was great and really was not a hassle at all. You get what you pay for in this world. The higher markup vs a Toyota or ford experience was really a step up. That investment into dealerships was also noted in their investment of staff. When my lease is up I will be right back at Rusnak Audi Pasadena to get another lease or purchase. Great work team!< /text>

Nice new building. Everything was clean and in compliance COVID-19 requirements. I felt very comfortable.   The technician who helped me was very helpful and I could tell he knew what he was doing.  I was very satisfied with the service and my Audi is riding 👌< /review>

I bought a pre-owned Audi Q5 from another dealer, and a few months later brought it to Pasadena Audi for what I worried was a coolant leak. Without hesitation Henry Perez assured me it would be checked out and most likely covered under warranty. In addition, Henry looked up the past service history and discovered there were still two free service visits left on the previous owners extended warranty! Of course the service maintenance was preformed and luckily no leak was detected, even after a pressure check. And most assuring of all, Henry asked that I come back after a couple of weeks for a free leak inspection... that's the definition of customer service!<//Review>

<Text>I was informed by Audi that my new Q7 had a recall and needed to be serviced. I also recently got locked out of my Audi WITH my keys in the car. It was very frustrating. When I called to make the service apt I also informed them that I needed Audi connect connected to my phone (to help unlock my car in case I ever got locked out again). They agreed to take care of it in addition to fixing the recall item.
When I showed up for my service apt at 8:30am, I reminded the service technician of the Audi connect issue. He agreed to have that fixed before the end of the day. When I came back at 6pm to pick up my car, I asked again about Audi connect and he sent a specialist to my car to help set it up. The first question the specialist asked was “where is the white plastic tag that came with your new set of keys when you received the car?”  I responded that it was at home. The specialist said, “oh, I’m so sorry. I can’t help you set up Audi connect without the info on the plastic let tag.” Why hadn’t ANYONE told me that I needed to bring in that key tag when I requested the Audi connect over and over again? I was so disappointed and frustrated! Poor customer service</Text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

The service was amazing. Even better than the sales experience.

Jorge Montoya and the rest of the service team were a delight. They were meticulous, knowledgeable, measured, kind, and respectful.

Without fear of overstating it, it was an excellent experience.< /text>

Bought a brand new audi q8, worst experience of my car buying life:
1. Did not tell me the battery of the show room car was dead and lied to me about the one plus hour delay while I waited they switched the battery (may have electrical issues)
2. Driving home, the door panel rattled from the stereo speaker and the alignment was off. This was on Christmas Eve so they were already closed. When I contacted them the day after Christmas, they said they would take care of it and said I had an appointment Monday morning in their service center. Not happy given the car was brand new.
3. Arrived at service center but no appointment had been made. Ended up spending six hours at the dealership and they were not able to align the vehicle because they also falsely said they had an-alignment tech in person to align the vehicle but did not. They told me it was ready and I could drive away but I asked for the alignment paperwork and they could not produce it. I told him to re-print it from the machine and they admitted they had not done the alignment. It was still not aligned. I had to come back the next day and spent five more hours there. They still did not align the vehicle
4. Obviously being upset, I sent multiple emails and walked back into the dealer talking to the general manager (Aaron something) And have on video him telling me it was not the dealers’ problem it was my problem now because it is my car. Imagine how livid I was after buying the vehicle -outright- and being treated this way
5. The pandemic began and I wasn’t able to get proper service for a few months then another dealer to try to align the vehicle but it could not be aligned. I drove the vehicle for seven more months before complaining to Audi corporate customer care Who finally arranged the proper vehicle correction at Audi Calabasas (fantastic service where i also took my SQ5)
6. Though the Audi connect package was part of my purchase, Pasadena refused to activate Audi connect (breach of contract? bad faith & fair business?). Other dealers will not do the activation because they will refer you back to the dealer from whom you purchased the vehicle. Audi care corporate arranged for it to be taken care of after a year without.
7. What would you do if you just purchased a brand new vehicle for a significant amount of money who refuse to provide all the features of the vehicle you just purchased, refused to service the vehicle properly, refused to address your issues, and treated you with such disrespect without taking responsibility?

I know I will Never purchased from this dealer again and urge you to think about my experience. They were super nice until I signed the dotted line and handed over the check for the entire purchase amount...< /Text>

Very impressed with their brand new service facilities where they recently relocated.

Jorge was my Service Advisor, the nicest guy possible, tried very hard to help out after discovering my Audi was badly soiled after parking overnight at their lot.  It was nobody’s fault but the person who did the car wash should pay more attention when they return the customer’s vehicle.  Overall a good experience, sans the dirty car episode.  Also good is everyone else is following the COVID protocol.<//Review>

<Text>I've been all over The Valley from rusnak and Westlake down to callabrass's to keys and finally rested in Pasadena  Rusnack Audi. The best service department have ever ever been in I atmosphere is awesome and number one service advisor I recommend Rudy ramirez if I can vote him president of the United States I would but he will not go and try too become president so recommending top man adviser because I go in eyes closed walk out knowing things get done. Word of advice to everyone reading this do not ever take your vehicle to keyes in van Nuys unless you want your car damaged or not taking care of or being told that your car nothing is wrong with it but yet there is I recommend Rusnak Pasadena Audi.< /Text>< Pics>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><text>Outstanding customer service.  I made an on-line appointment which was so convenient ; a service advisor immediately approached my vehicle and from there, it was top-notch from the drop off, the communication and to the ease of picking up my car.  It's so nice they offer Uber and other services if you are without your car. Anthony Ramirez was professional, helpful and made this appointment hassle free; I have Audi care and it was taken care of with zero hassle.  I've been to another Audi dealership and did not receive close to this kind of outstanding customer experience.  Rusnak knows how to do it!< /text></record>

I have been with Rusnak Pasadena Audi for about 6 years now. Their service has always been outstanding even when mistakes were made or delays or recalls to any of our vehicles. They have always done their utmost to work with me and correct any issue that may arise. Specifically Henry has always been a great vehicle service advisor for us throughout the years.<//Review>

As always, the entire service team at Rusnak goes above and beyond. Great technicians, managers and staff and everyone courteous and kind. Rudy was wonderful and kept me informed every step of the way.  When the repair part was delayed in arrival he made sure I had a car to drive, which I so appreciated.

I won’t go anywhere else!  Thanks Rusnak!< /review>

During this pandemic the members of the  Rusnak Audi  Repair Section used PPP to service us and other clients There is a seating area outside of the facility. I was appraised me continually on the progress of my Audi. I processed my payment with no contact. They really do practice social distancing. Very polite, kind and helpful to customers.<//Review>

<Review>Truly amazing service. From the moment one arrives to the moment one leaves, this experience at Rusnak Audi exceeds all other makes of car care.
I chose to wait while my car was receiving TLC.
Excellent choices of coffee, hot chocolate etc and constant updating on the length of time before my car would be available. The whole service took around two and a half hours.
This included a wash. Driving away the car seemed full of an entirely new and powerful energy. Congratulations to everyone involved.
I’m sorry the survey limits one to 5 stars -
I would happily have given 10.

We had a really wonderful experience working with Rusnak Audi. While we didn't end up purchasing a vehicle from them, Karsten, the rep we worked with, was incredibly helpful, kind and responsive. He promptly answered all questions and was very proactive about getting the information we needed. He even congratulated us when we broke the news that we went with another car. A top notch gentleman thru and thru.</Text>

<review>Best vehicle purchase experience ever! I recently purchased an new Audi for my wife, as a surprise. I worked directly with Yalonda Conrad who was amazing! Typically when using the chat feature on the website you get directed to someone who may not even be at that dealership. I used the chat feature and it was actually the salesperson! Yalonda answered all of my questions through chat and followed up immediately via email. Negotiations were simple and pleasant and when I arrived to pick up the vehicle it was ready and waiting with no more than a thirty minutes of paperwork till I drove off in our new car. Rusnak customer service is impeccable and their staff was amazing. Yalonda was a pleasure to work with. She went out of her way to make sure I was completely happy with the vehicle before even committing to the sale. I will definitely be purchasing again from her in the future. Best service. Best price. Best dealership. Thank you!< /review>< user_id>

<review>I had a shockingly bad experience trying to work with this dealership. It really defined my understanding of "bad business".

I've condensed this story best I could. I was an out-of-state buyer. I couldn't physically be at the dealership, so I was going to buy/finance remotely and then fly over and drive the car home. Over the span of 5 days, I expressed constant interest in a very recently posted car, and was ready to buy the car immediately for the full listed price + whatever fees as soon as pictures were posted (as It was suggested I should wait). Genuinely it was the car and deal I had been looking for a few months, and the salesman I worked with knew that. The night before the big day, I was told by the current salesman on my case, Christian, that he'd reach out the second he located the car and could get pictures to me. The next day, I check the website at noon, and magically the car's pictures had been posted to the website, and it was on the showroom floor. Frantically I call and tell Christian we want go forward with buying the car and we are getting the financials in order and we need an hour. Christian calls shortly later and says the manager is okay holding the car for an hour, and at that point in time I tell him we are completely ready to go. He tells me he will send the payment information as soon as he hangs up. 30 minutes go by, no email, he calls, and tells me a customer has just arrived and is asking about it. This is when everything seems to be thrown out the window. The car is suddenly not being held, and their magical "first come first serve" policy only seems to apply to the customer that just walked in, not the customer that is outright trying to buy the car at that very moment, and has been communicating constant interest over the last 5 days.

Christian hangs up shortly after, and then completely ghosts. I call multiple times. I talk to other salesman, one even catches Christian walking by and tells him to call me. Nothing. 5 hours and multiple calls later, I am told by another salesman the car has just been sold. Christian never reached out.

Maybe out-of-state is a little bit harder to work with, but the lack of integrity shown was shocking. Not only did they entirely disregard a weeks worth of continued strong interest and commitment to pay immediately when it was ready, but the complete ghosting that followed was incredibly unprofessional. It is important to note that Christian was only one of a good handful of people that knew I was interested and prepared to buy the car as soon as it was properly documented.

I'd wager if your an in-person buyer you won't face this issue directly, but it is important to understand the underlying integrity of a few people you might end up working with. I want to add that the first salesman I worked with, Guy Peterson, did a great job and proved that his own commission was clearly not the first priority.<//review>< pictures>

The level of service and professionalism shown from Ivan and David are unparalleled. Not only were they patient and hard-working, but Ivan delivered the car to our home and went over all the tips and features my dad wanted to know about the new Q5. This level of care was never shown by the other 4 dealerships we've purchased Audis from (3 dealerships on the East Coast, 1 other in SoCal) in addition to exceeding the best of service we've received from other makes. Looking forward to upgrading our C43 in late 2021 to an S5 Sportback! Rusnak will always be our go-to.< /Review><date>1603925151622<//date>< pictures>

<Text>I purchased a 2019 Q7 in November 2019. It was used as a loaner car by the dealership and only had 4,000 miles. Since purchasing my car it has stopped running 3x. Each time it is “fixed” at the dealership the same issue happens. This Car is a lemon! I reached out to the dealership for support and each time I am told someone will call me back, but I never received a call back. I do not recommend this dealership, they just care about selling a car.< /Text><Response>{'time': 1593196900381, 'text': 'Hi Smadar,\n\u200b\n\u200bI am sorry to hear about any disappointment in regards to the vehicle purchased.

Pretty good service. They try to push their financing on you a lot but I guess thats the game when it comes to car sales. If you don't want to fill out a credit application they make you jump through hoops even if you have financing from somewhere else. Distasteful.

很好的一家audi dealer，經理Daysi 人很nice，會繼續支持奧迪

Well,just can’t fall asleep in the summer night,if rate once again,just regard this facility as below average,I bought this 2019 Q7 in January 2020,that’s funny because the all new 2020 models have the new design and technology,this Q7,like I mentioned,too silly to buy,and the keypoint is,the manager forced me to buy the audicare plan that supposed to be free if I purchase the 2020 model,so why do I need to waste five grand for a completely useless warranty extension?what’s more,I’m a carplay lover,when it turns to 2021,I realized that even if I plug in the original cable,the vechile system seems to have issue with the connectivity,when drive this Q7 across some humps,easily disconnected,what can I say?It’s just a cable,not some fragile glass,so how can you guys,I mean Audi,define the sport utility vechile?
Eventually,I sold this Q7 in this April,after  purchased on one year and three months ago,for a 2021 Range Rover,which is more expensive and also makes me more SATISFIED!<//review>< UserId.>

I had an amazing experience at the Rusnak Audi Service Center.
My service advisor, Bobby, was very helpful. He explained exactly what was needed, both right now and down the line, in a very easy to understand way. He was knowledgeable, friendly, considerate and respectful. Every other staffer was incredibly nice. I loved my visit to Rusnak and look forward to returning for years to come. I cannot praise them enough.<//Text>

The service advisor Henry was very helpful and responsible. He answered all my questions and took care of my car.  He didn't try to sell me unnecessary services. Head and shoulder above the prior advisor I had.  Ask for Henry and you will not be disappointed.< /Text>

Hello. I would like to share my latest experience with Audi. I neet to purchase new convertible car for summer. One my of my list car was Audi.
We came to test drive a5 at 6:30 pm our sales manager was Hose. Our was appointment was scheduled later today. We used to wait car for  20 minutes. Then they said there's no gas. After 3 minutes they said they short of staff. Finally as I understood they didn't want to sell a car. We left. Really disappointed with Audi Pasadena.<//Review>

Great service provided from start to finish by Anthony Ramirez. Seamless really. Thoughtful customer care from when I stopped in last minute for a brake inspection to providing a free of charge Uber to and from my house. The service performed on my RS7 was replacement of the brake pads and Anthony kept me up to date and informed throughout the entire process. The exterior wash was also a nice touch. Thank you!<//Text>

I had a great experience here... I worked with Adrian the entire time, and he was always incredibly professional and helpful. I was able to get exactly the car, model, color, and price I was looking for thanks to everyone and especially Adrian.  I will be returning for all my services, and any future purchases I plan to make. 5/5 I highly recommend!

Great service for my Q5. I always have my car service here. For a 20k maintenance, I took my car in in the morning and got a Uber ride back home. Once it was finished, I was notified on my phone and an Uber was else to to pick me up to get my car. They also gave me a car wash and I was ready to drive back home. Easy and friendly service.</Text>

I just bought a new Audi from Rusnak Audi and this was by far the best experience I've ever had buying a new car.  I worked with Rick Torres and he was great to work with!  He really worked hard to get me a good deal which made it possible for me to get the exact car I wanted.  They were very fair, fast and really great to work with.  Plus I love my car!!!  Thanks to Rick and the Rusnak team.< /Review>

I've called and left him two messages since this morning without a call back. I also tried calling the main number, I was told that he was with a client and would get back to me; that was several hours ago. I called again asking for a supervisor, I was told that there were none available? My experience with Audi has always been stellar. I'm not sure why I'm being treated this way???

<rate>5< /rate><text>Most seamless service experience I’ve ever had. Bobby was great and approachable. He took the time to explain my repairs and answered all my questions. The Uber service offered is a great touch and eliminated the inconvenience one has to deal with when dropping off their vehicle and finding a ride to and fro. Although the amenities aren’t as expansive as the Fletcher Jones BH Service Department, the customer service and timeliness was so much better! Only feedback I have was that I don’t believe my car was washed...or it was washed pretty poorly. That was disappointing.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><date>1579323758628<//date>< gmapID>

I'd like to say I ended up at Rusnak Audi as a result of an unfortunate event. I had an accident and totaled my car. My dad and I decided to stop by just to look at the new Audi q3 since I had not seen close look nor had a test drive, on our drive back home to Orange County.
As soon as we walked in we were welcome by Jose. Jose was very nice and put all his effort into helping us to come to a deal on a price that I would be able to afford. It all worked out in just a few hours and my Audi Q3 was ready to go! I can't recommend Rusnak Pasadena enough! The car is beautiful and loving it already. Thanks for the great awesome experience. Very exciting to be part of the Audi family!<//Review>

David Sickler was excellent in customer service but the cashier was not very helpful. I didn't know my reps name because my original rep was on vacation. I stated to her I didn't know but I gave her my name and she was not a good listener and couldn't find it. She proceeded to ask personal questions that had nothing to do with the situation. I responded: what does that have to do with my picking up my car. It was as if, she didn't believe me and that made me feel uncomfortable. I didn't say anymore and she realized that I wasn't responding and final figured out what she needed to do. If she would have only listened from the start she would not have had any issues. I would suggest that more communication be given in advance in order to treat matters with their upmost professionalism. It's not complicated to understand someone name, if she would have only listened.</Review>

UNPROFESSIONAL!  Very slow to get to financing to sign paperwork, when I was paying in cash anyway.  The salesman, Taylor lied to me about the features of the vehicle, stating it had options that it did not.  When I went to leave, he couldn’t even show me how to operate the Audi I bought, stating he didn’t really know anything about the Audi I bought! He wanted me to go back another day, so one of their experts could show me how to operate the car... and  he claimed he had been working there 2 years!  The key wasn’t working to open the trunk, despite a battery replacement, so Taylor was going to mail me a new key along with the spare key, he claimed he couldn’t access because it was in a safe.  It has been well over a month and I still have not received the spare key!  It took over 3 weeks before they sent me a new key, which is not programmed, so this car has been sitting in my garage for 6 weeks, without being driven, and now it won’t even start!  I have things locked in the trunk that I can’t even get out, because the car is completely dead!  I have called Mehren, and Joe, and am not getting any responses from either.<//text>

Dropped my car off at the service department. Ian De Los Reyes is the best. Everything was great. They did everything I asked ( I am very particular with my car). The only thing is I wish the car wash they provide paid more attention to detail. Especially at a dealership that sells high performance and luxury vehicles<//review>

Worst dealership I have ever been to in my entire life. That is not an overstatement. Beautiful cars disrespected. Brand new models not kept clean so the paint on just about every car was permanently damaged. Even the ground in the yard amongst Bentleys, Porsches, and Audis, had bits of trash strewn about the place. Disgusting, and sad. Poor cars.<//Review>

I have had the best experience here from walking in the door and being greeted right away.

Worse service dept ever. They lie and cover it up as miscommunication.  I had an appointment at 10a. Showed up on time and was told by the advisor it should take about 3hrs to work on my car. Since i had my 5mo old and 5yo kids with me I told him they will not last that long and he told me he would find me a loaner or get me to enterprise to rent a car. He told me to wait in the waiting room and he will come and let me know.  After waiting an hour and having no one coming to tell me anything i walked around to the front to find him and when i did he said hes still looking to find me a loaner. After waiting about 30-45 more minutes and by now the kids are getting restless and hungry I go searching for him and realized he's probably out to lunch, but I see my car in their shop and the mechanic working on it. The receptionist (Perla) says she'll find my advisor and comes back and says the car is almost ready. Ok, so i went back inside to wait another 30 minutes. I come back out after and the car is not in the shop anymore. Still no news from anyone.  Now I'm getting upset and i ask Perla what's going on and I hear her on the walkie telling them to wash the car. However when she comes in, she tells me they are currently washing my car. (Um.....i just heard you tell them to pick up my car to wash.) Now i know they are giving me the runaround and wasting my time. Dont lie to me when it's so obvious you forgot to either work on my car or your company doesnt want to spend the extra money on getting me a rental since all the loaner vehicles are gone. I get better communication and less lies when i go to the Honda service center. I even purchased the extended Audi care service package from them today and this is how they treat their customers.   When i made the initial appointment i told them i needed a loaner if the service was going to take a long time and that was reflected on the initial service papers. When my advisor finally comes he pulls up in a vehicle and tells me the receptionist told him I told her I was going to wait for my car.  I never said such things and he never once came up to me in the waiting room to confirm that. In the end i ended up waiting 3-1/2 hr for my car even after telling them i needed a loaner/rental or transportation. How can you advertise VIP Audi service, but don't deliver? I definitely will not be returning to this dealership for anything in the future.</text>

Lina Berkes is amazing and she goes far and beyond! Even though we didn’t make the deal happen because the specific model of the car is not in stock here, but I would absolutely recommend her to everyone. She is knowledgeable patient and make you feel really comfortable. 5 star for her and Pasadena audi<//Review>

Wow, how convenient, the service station is closed on the weekends, why don't we think about what would make it convenient for our customers and do the EXACT opposite and on top of it you can't reserve a loaner, so let's keep the theme of inconvenience going and add that to the list!  THANKS, won't be leasing my next car from you, NICE JOB!</Review>

Johnny Borja was amazing! He took care of the service my car needed in a timely manner, got us a rental, washed and vacuumed my car. I had previously gone to a different Audi dealership closer to home where I was not even acknowledged by the service staff. As soon as we pulled up to Rusnak Audi one of their attendants took our name and checked us in letting Johnny know we were there for our appointment. I also cannot recall a time I have ever received a follow up call to see how my car is doing after the service! Thank you Rusnak and Johnny for the amazing experience. Will definitely be returning.< /Review>

<text>I was reluctant to buy fro Rusnak as we previously had a bad experience. However, I'm glad I went. Jose Santos was probably the best salesperson I have ever bought a car from. He was super patient and determined to get me what I wanted. When it came to making a deal he was accommodating and matched another deal my husband found for me. The sales manager, Matt (maybe Mark?) was also great. I did not feel like I was being manipulated in any way. I definitely got exactly what I wanted for the price I wanted to pay with guys that were super easy to deal with.<//text>< rating>

Kirk Wallace was very clear and thorough with reviewing car service needs and recommendations.

<Text>I worked with Yolanda Conrad for several months to focus on the right car to succeed the A6 I leased from Rusnak three years ago.  She was professional, flexible and well-informed, never going over the line into either exaggeration or pressure tactics.  She is -- quite simply -- the best I have ever met at fulfilling her responsibilities and representing her dealership with integrity.  For reasons that have nothing to do with her, I chose another car and she has been incredibly gracious.  I'm buying my next car from Yolanda.  I don't care what kind of car that will be; I trust her.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

Vince and Ian are the best. Always looking out for their customers.  This place rocks as their is free coffee/espresso machines.  They provide Porto's pastries and water.  Service waiting area is clean and plenty of area to work if you want to do mobile work while you wait.

The only only thing I would change is their old antiquated bathrooms.  Other than that the service and quality are outstanding.  Thank you for doing a superb job always.< /Text>

<text>Great car buying experience! Yalonda was terrific! During communications through email, she answered questions and made sure to find vehicles that had the requirements I was looking for. When I arrived at the dealership, I looked at three different vehicles and again there was no pressure to buy the most expensive one. Yalonda wanted to make sure I was purchasing a vehicle I would be happy with. Finance was an easy process. Everything was explained and there was no pressure to buy the extended warranty. I would highly recommend Rusnak Audi.< /text>< Pics>

<text>I have been looking at an Audi for quite some time, originally considering an A4.  But when I saw the A5, I was hooked.  I put out a request to all local Audi dealers and Michael Parrish responded within 5 minutes.  After a little back and forth on email, he told me about a 2016 Black A5 that had everything I wanted and it happened to be the first 2016 delivered.  Mike made it all very easy.  No pressure.  Great price.  Kevin in finance was also great.  I traded in a 8 year old Toyota 4Runner and drove away in a new A5.  From test drive to driving off, was only about 2 hours.  I returned the next day for the full debrief on all the features and settings.  I feel like I'm driving a computer.  Part if me wishes I had a longer commute so I can enjoy the car more.< /text><gmap_id>0x80c2c375d38c5c81:0x3bfb1f6861a087f< /gmap_id></record>

I went just to test drive the Q7 and Q8. I was a 10 year Merceredes driver. I was assisted by a wonderful young man named Daniel Catalan. There was no pressure just information. I spent about 2 hours and said thank you and went home. My husband came home a few hours later and I could not stop talking about the gorgeous Q7 I fell for. We ate a quick dinner and went back to buy the car. Kimberly Amaya in Financing was wonderful in the finance department.</Text>

Henry Perez the Service Sales Advisor was very helpful and responsive to my request for the servicing to be ready before 3:00. He called me even before the time requested, which I greatly appreciated. Henry comes highly recommended by at least four of my friends who own Audis. I was not disappointed in requesting him as the Service Advisor. He explained the costs in a clear and concise manner and I did not feel patronized.</Text>

<time>1525295815968<//time><text>I lived in Houston, TX for 5 years and the Audi Service Center there was 5+ stars.  This place is zero stars at best.  I have been forgotten about while waiting in the lobby area while waiting for a loaner car.  I have picked up my car with nearly zero gas in the tank and fortunately made it to the nearest gas station.  On my recent visit this week, I was almost given a loaner car with zero gas in it (common trend apparently).  When I picked up my car, the window visor part (to be fixed) was in the coffee cup holder.  I returned to get it installed, because I did just pay for parts and labor.  Yes, this is a minor point but my overall bill to fix the injection leak and replace the air manifold was nearly 4K.  After it was replaced, I drove off and the check engine light went off... so as I wait, I decided to write this.  Now I question if they are really performing the ‘labor’ they say they are.  In addition, in a prior visit, I was reimbursed for a repair because it wasn’t done correctly.  I will never return to this service center, despite it’s convenient location to my office.  Avoid if you can!  The client service level here is sub-par for the amount you pay.<//text><UserId.>112496161943574801509</UserId.><Pictures>None< /Pictures><rating>1</rating>< response>

He was always updating us about the status of the vehicle, and I always felt in the loop with the latest news. I enjoyed working with him and my daughter loves her new car. George was also an amazing help to us. Overall 10/10 experience at this Audi dealership. Our family would definitely recommend this dealership to everyone.</review><Rate>5</Rate><name>Hong Kang<//name>< Time>

<review>Loved everything about this dealership and the expert, Ernie, who I worked with.

I would recommend this dealership to anyone looking for a great deal along with a memorable experience. The experience that Rusnak provided added on to how much I enjoy my car every time I get behind the wheel. To me, it's a package deal and regardless of how great a car is, it can't speak for itself. I truly feel like I got the whole package here.

Ernie let me test drive the car for a good amount of time while he explained everything about the car. He explained things in lament terms making it easy for me to understand. He compared the car to other cars in its class like the 3 series, IS, and Q50 and explained how it is a better fit for what I'm looking for. I appreciated the comparisons and the information he had to offer.

The negotiations that took place were great as well. Ernie was able to get me the car I love with the package I wanted for a price I could afford. He made it possible for me and I really appreciate that. Everyone else in the dealership was personable and kind as well. Thank you Audi of Pasadena!< /review>< resp>

Cars are in general more expensive than other Audi dealer. But their Service is legit, very good service

Update: did a service and they offered a engine reseal service for 1600$ for a tiny oil leak. They probably get some of the client to pay for that... very disapointed they even offered.</text>

<text>I'm pretty surprised by all these less than stellar reviews - my sister and I had an amazing & painless car leasing experience with Ivan!  There is no doubt in my mind that he is an invaluable asset to Rusnak Audi.  We had shopped around previously with several other dealers and Ivan was incredibly responsive, honest & helpful.  We felt no pressure whatsoever and it truly was the best car buying/releasing experience.  My sister was undecided between the A4 Premium or Premium Plus package and we did not feel any type of pressure to go one way or another.  He was informative and presented her with all the necessary details to make an informed decision.  In the end, she decided on the Premium Plus package and we feel really happy that we worked with Ivan!! Thank you so much! I will definitely highly recommend him to any friends/family looking for an Audi.  We plan to come back to him in 3 years when it's time for our new leases.<//text><user_name>Tina Tom< /user_name><Time>1530560971690<//Time><Rate>5< /Rate><Pics>None</Pics><userid>112780954728592306065</userid><Gmap_id>0x80c2c375d38c5c81:0x3bfb1f6861a087f<//Gmap_id><resp>{'time': 1531162932248, 'text': 'Thank you so much for taking the time to leave us such a great review!

This is a COMPLETE dealership,  where the entire staff makes you feel "special. " Let's be honest, you need to spend money to maintain your vehicle.  But at RUSNAK,  you're greeted as an individual. I've been have my AUDI serviced here for awhile,  and there Service Advisor made me so confident in the dealership,  I bought a new (2018) Audi,  and KEPT THE OLDER ONE.  😎</Review>

<review>Very slow to get to financing to sign paperwork, when I was paying in cash anyway.  The salesman, Taylor lied to me about the features of the vehicle, stating it had options that it did not.  When I went to leave, he couldn’t even show me how to operate the Audi I bought, stating he didn’t really know anything about the Audi I bought! He wanted me to go back another day, so one of their experts could show me how to operate the car... and  he claimed he had been working there for 2 years!  I live 4 hours away, so that is not an option.  I only bought the car there because my Audi broke down and I needed to get home, and it was a Saturday, so no mechanics were open, or car rental shops.  So I traded in my 2006 Audi for $300!

So it has been over 3 weeks,since I purchased my Audi, and I have called and emailed REPEATEDLY, and I still do not have the keys that were supposedly “In the mail” 3 weeks ago!  The manager that responded to this review is MIA, telling me to reach out to him! DO NOT BELIEVE THE REST OF THESE REVIEWS!  They have obviously been purchased.  It is a scam.  My name is Rachel,  by the way<//review>< Time>

I got a better experience at a toyota dealership(for my mother) earlier the same day. It's a sad day when a toyota dealerships gives you more attention then a audi dealer. So now I will take my business to anouther audi dealership.this happened on 8/30</text><userid>103680557294735183168</userid><rating>1</rating>< Gmap_id>

<Text>The Rusnak Audi team is friendly and knowledgeable. Their estimate was accurate and my car was repaired in a reasonable amount of time and ready when they said it would be.

The guys in Service were great.  Danny, Jaime and Ian went above and beyond to help me with my service.  They were meticulous and very thorough.  One night they stayed late for me for a test drive after the service was completed.  Highly recommend.< /review>

I’m shocked that you kept my car for 3 days in attempt to find a noice I hear once in awhile that worried me!  They could not find anything to fix.  They gave me a car to drive did my 10000 mile service and didn’t charge me a penny.  Ian, my service man, was polite, friendly and very helpful.  I would recommend them to anyone.< /review>

<Review>I received a letter: "Due to high demand, we will buy back your Audi". OK, let me go to the dealership. An obnoxious person starts with: "do you know its a scam? It is just to generate traffic!". Well... I ask whether they buy leased Audi or not. Answer: "do you know, SMART Audi owner know not to cancel a lease!" "How much money do you expect to get? You know? you will own me money at the end!" Instead of getting up and going home I asked: "Well, given that I made it here, can you give me some number, I will then decide whether to go ahead or not". Answer: "Audi buyers are intelligent and know better. If you really want I can check for a trade with another Audi." "No I really want a Maserati". As she started with the "Smart Audi owner" refrain, I picked up and left.

It appears to me, through observation of this Pasadena operation, that the service levels are waning.  'Waning' means getting worse, not better.  The service techs are awesome professionals and they deserve better support from the admin levels.....at this point, I am very close to bringing my R8 to another Audi (non Rusnak) dealer but my loyalty to the service reps is still stronger than management's decision to transfer the incremental cost of an additional phone receptionist during peak periods to me in the form of time-costs of holding on line for ridiculous lengths of time.  This is only the beginning of the service problems that I have experienced in my three-year record as a customer of this dealership. The next Audi race car I buy is likely to be from another, non-Rusnak, dealership......but I am still holding out that Management will pull their head of the proverbial dark place and right this ship!< /review>

It was a delight to work with Koni and the rest of the team at Rusnak.  He was friendly, helpful, flexible and real and took the dread out of the usual dealership
buying experience. We are very happy with our purchase and came away with a great car and a great taste in our mouth as well. The finance lady(whose name I have forgotten, sorry) was great as well.  Highly recommended.  😀😀😀😀<//Review>

<review>I originally walked in for a test drive of the A3 e-tron, but I ended falling in love with it. No one was stalking me the moment I walked in and no one tried to push anything on me. Chenchen helped me and I was out of the door in my new car under 4 hours.

I had my car also tinted and the service department took great care of me, especially the ladies at the check-in desk. The tint guy forgot to clean up the soap stains, but the service team was there to get that corrected ASAP. Mike and Perla (might be misspelled or incorrect) - thank you for taking care of me and for being so fantastic!<//review></record></dataset><record>

I had been working with a dealer close to my home, but when I did a search for a new red Audi S5, two came up.  I emailed both dealers to find out if they truly had one.  I heard back from Omega within minutes and decided to go the next day, "just to see one in red."  Omega was patient, watched, listened, and asked me if I would like to take the car home for the night.  I thought he was crazy and told him so.  I brought it back the next day and a day after that, purchased a brand new red S5.  That NEVER would have occurred if I had not met Omega.  He is an eagle.  He never pushed and he made sure every step of the transaction was smooth and painless.  I have purchased many cars in my life, and I can tell you that Omega Chambers is the BEST!  Now, if I could only convince him to sell homes with me...</review>< Pics>

Excellent service all the way around. Very attentive, helpful, and nice loaner cars! Everything was repaired to original condition, everything checked with me before I picked it up, service was quick without a lot of waiting around. Good complementary coffee and Porto's pastries too!< /review>

They never even answered the phone to make a service appointment. After being on hold, I was finally forced to leave a message to be "called back in the order received" but was never called back. After calling them they said I couldn't get in for nine days as a loaner wasn't available until then.
I called Santa Monica Audi and not only did they actually answer the phone I got an appointment for the next morning with a loaner car.<//Text>

He gave a detailed tutorial of the car's features and provided me with his contact info should i have any additional questions down the road.

<Text>My rating is directed at Audi/Volkswagen company most Audi owners are not aware there is a serious issue with Audi vehicles as I discovered and read about others on line. It's a $3000 Module  replacement repair. Your car will be completely dead. The sad part about it Audi has made it a Exclusive audi repair that's why the cost is so high no other auto repair shop is allowed to make this repair on Audis. Many audi owners would like a class action lawsuit so the longer you own your Audi the higher the chance you will be having this repair, be aware this repair could be coming to you. Time will tell!<//Text>< date>

Not only was the facility beautifully maintained and flooded with incredible cars, but the people there stood out above it all. I was greeted promptly and politely upon arrival (in a tow truck, poor Audi) and was treated like family immediately. Johnny was AMAZING. He did absolutely everything he could to make sure that I was happy, well taken care of, and my Audi was fixed as quickly as possible.

I would've saved a lot of time and gas if I just went to Rusnak Audi instead of going to all the other dealerships that weren't willing to negotiate; they all would say "sorry can't do that". Thankfully I came across Jose, an eager salesman that wants to make a deal and is willing to give you the best price you can find.

Thank you Rusnak! 100% will come back for my next Audi!< /review><userid>101492275153565693572</userid></record></dataset><record>

<text>Outstanding customer service, clean facility, and excellent service.  Daniel Allen took extra care to ensure I had everything I needed and answered all of my questions.  He is a credit to his team in sales at Audi.  Specifically, when I needed to come in 4 hours early due to a sudden change in time constraints, Daniel took it upon himself to come in before scheduled and was waiting to open the door for me when I arrived.
Rusnak has an impressive selection of exotic vehicles and an intelligent helpful staff that towers over the competition.<//text><time>1379518197952</time>< name>

<Review>The day before Thanksgiving, traveling from Fresno to San Diego, we noticed a loud squealing sound with our A8L. Fortunately for us, Rusnak Audi was only 2 miles away. Our service advisor Henry, took wonderful care of us. He understood the time cruch we we're in to get to San Diego in time to pick up our house rental keys. He was able to get us in and out in under an hour and a half. We really appreciate the staff for going above and beyond by working us in right away to their schedule and making a stressful situation, much less stressful for us.< /Review>< gmap_id>

They have very good deal but that's not the reason I buy my car from them , its their integrity and attitude,  they kept their promise and won't play trick on the number,  and best of all, they makes me felt like I am welcome and very helpful unlike Bevely Hills Audi, they are totally opposite,  I guess Beverly Hills Audi is like Donald Trump,  they only like rich people, anyway,  my shopping experience with Rusnsk is AWESOME, and I highly recommend the salesperson name Larry Gootkin, he is extremely helpful , patience and nice, I am so happy I found them!</text>

First time using Uber for ride home and back. That part is not seamless yet. First Uber went to front of building instead of the service area and left because he did not see me. Second Uber did the same but called so had to run to front of building. Anyway I got home ok.< /text>< rating>

<Text>My first time visiting Rusnak/Pasadena Audi to perform the yearly service on my RS5. My service advisor, Ian, was very friendly and helpful in explaining the details of the service. Although I didn’t have an appointment on this day, Monday, the car was ready within a few hours. This was the last service of the Audi Care, Ian suggested I look into purchasing another Audi Care package for subsequent services, which I will do next time the car is in for service.</Text>< Gmap_id>

<text>Jim, the service point of contact for me was great, kept me informed the whole time, etc. The one thing that this place could improve on is answering their phones more. I always get put on hold for a long time to get someone on the line. Once I get them on though, they handle the situation well. But maybe there needs to be more staffing in that regard.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Yalonda was GREAT. She saw me as a person not a paycheque. I bought a CPO Q5 from her and she dealt with me fairly, respectfully and honestly. I can't speak to any other of the sales team here but Yalonda made what can be a stressful and distasteful experience (car buying) a straightforward and painless process. She has responded to my after-sales questions as well. I dealt with a bunch of dealerships and salespeople during my purchasing process and had many options but Yalonda at Rusnak was whom I wanted to buy from. Their price was reasonable for a CPO car as well.< /Text>

Got my 2nd car here but 1st car from a dealership. The 1st person, Daniel, helped me out and is the man. Made my process smooth and seemed to help me out on calling the banks I think. Kim was the 2nd person who continued the process smooth as well. It can be hard for an individual in a different environment in terms of diversity wise. Anyways, I digress and my overall experience was great. This was all in December 2018 and bearly reviewing now as of March.
Update July 17 2019, My first complimentary service was great!
Update May 2020,  My 2nd service was great as well. Changed my oil as well and did the service checklist for the 2nd year inspection. It benefits a lot to have the warranty, I didn't have to pay anything for my 2018 A4.<//Review>

<Review>Rusnak Pasadena is an amazing car dealership if you're looking for the perfect car for the perfect fit that meets your driving needs. I had an excellent salesman explain all the ins and outs of the car I ended up purchasing (Audi A4 if you'd like to know) and walked me and my family through the process from discussion to financing. This process can be convoluted and confusing, but the Financing Agent was absolutely nice enough to walk us through the Financing Review process which lead to a quick and easy 30 minute process. At this point, Rusnak Pasadena got me so excited to get a Display Show Midnight Blue Audi A4.

The next day, when I couldn't set up my homelink, my salesman drove over to my house personally to help me set it up. I can't recommend Rusnak Pasadena highly enough. It's good to note it is out of the way for me, but I make sure I take the time driving there to get excellent quality service. I highly recommend checking this place out if you're looking to buy a new car.

The staff is excellent, the complimentary catered food/drinks makes this experience even more enjoyable while being hosted at Rusnak Pasadena.

If you need to make purchases for your awesome and sexy brand new Audi, the car shop has a nice and friendly staff that even offer discounts to ensure you get the piece of car equipment you need.

Rusnak Pasadena is the place to go to meet your Brand New Sexy Vehicle Needs! Check it out!<//Review><response>{'time': 1473195229832, 'text': 'Jonathon, I am so glad to hear that Ivan was extremely helpful during your purchasing experience.

<Review>Terrible experience. Drove over 2 and a half hours to purchase a car had check in hand and the manager decided to sell the car to another guy even though I was there before him. He pretty much “held” the car for the other guy even though no one put down a deposit for the car so it should have been first come first serve but it wasn’t. Absolutely ridiculous I suggest never going to this dealership because the way they do business is unprofessional and a waste of time money and effort.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

I am always satisfied with the service I receive from Pasadena Audi. The excellent service begins from the moment I check in which includes the pre-service explanation, and ends with my car being returned running like a dream.

Overall my experience with Rusnak Audi has been positive.  This is a very well-run business that works hard to make a visit there much better than most dealerships.  I have personally found each and every employee that I have had contact with genuinely personable and responsible.  The whole service entrance process is very well designed and fast moving.

They make an effort to connect you with same service writer each time and even if it is an alternate, they look over your file and know you and your car quickly.

Personally I know Johnnie is always easy to deal with.

<Review>My husband and I had the pleasure of working with David Carter at Audi Rusnak Pasadena a few weeks ago for our first Audi lease, and he was nothing less than spectacular! Truthfully, we were planning on just test driving the new A5, and getting some quotes since I've been eyeing the that car for quite some time... David had greeted us immediately upon arrival and answered all the questions we had about the car, took us out for a test drive, and when it came down to the numbers, he really took the time to find out what our needs were and he didn't make us feel like we had to rush into a decision immediately. Long story short, he found a plan that worked with us and we were sold! We really enjoyed our experience with David because he was honest throughout the whole process, he's definitely someone we'd recommend to friends and family, and we look forward to working with David on our next car!< /Review>< pictures>

I bought the maintenance service package when I leased the Q7 last November.  Yet to schedule an oil change no slot is available unless I book 2 to 3 weeks in advance.  I travel for work so it is hard for me to schedule something as simple and quick as an oil change that far in advance.  I'm better off going to an oil change franchise and paying $30.  I can't believe they can't have a better service program set up for a program they work so hard to sell when a person buys or leases a car.  Sounds like a money maker to me - sell the program hard and then make it difficult to use.  Love the car - frustrated with the maintenance service program.<//Text>

I do not how is the service, only know I wait for uber pick up 50 minutes. If you need to pick up,  make sure the location is correct on their map. I did not k,ow their system, I found out after they order my uber, the location was wrong and no way can communicate uber driver. See the car go different direction on map, no way can stop it.<//text>

Bunch of lying time wasting bafoons. Told me to come in for a deal that they later said is not possible on top of that the guy that promised the deal who's name was David completely flaked out and was not there after I called in 4 times to make sure we get this done today. The annoying part is that he reassured us that we won't be wasting our time. Avoid this place at all costs unless you like people that lie to your face and if your time is not valuable to you.</text>

<review>Great service and care when I drove in for my Q7 maintenance service.  Egan Kwan, the Service Manager, was courteous and very helpful.  Egan is an excellent Service Manager and great at diagnosing problems and helpful in scheduling my transportation in an expedient manner.

All in all, a great experience in the Service Department.< /review><pics>None< /pics></record></dataset><record>

Rusnak Audi service is as well run as the magnificent cars they service. I don't know who set up the service department, but they are a coordination genius. I wouldn't take my Audi S6 anywhere else. I am truly amazed by what I have seen there.<//text>

My  experience at Rusnak Audi was truly outstanding! I worked with Alex for an entire day as he walked me through all my questions. The customer service he provided was so refreshing . He truly cares about making his customers happy and I'm so thankful I got to work with him. The staff at Audi Rusnak is truly the best! I love my Q3 and  I look forward to sending my family and friends there!

Sincerely,
Erica Spencer</Review>

Fantastic car buying experience at Rusnak Audi in Pasadena! Yolanda Conrad was very friendly, knowledgeable, and patient as my family and I figured out which car was right for us. No hard sell was ever deployed by her or Jam Nejad the finance guy when I signed the closing docs. Yolanda even went so far as suggest independent websites I could use to verify the great deal I was getting.<//review>

IAN DELOS REYES in Service!!!! YOU ARE THE BEST!!  I don't really give out reviews,  but the service I have gotten from Ian Delos Reyes at Rusnak Audi Pasadena is not only top notch but THE BEST.  Very professional, timely, DID NOT STOP UNTIL IT EXCEEDED MY EXPECTATIONS.  Very knowledgeable with what he does and you don't feel lost with the whole experience unlike what I have gotten at other Audi Dealerships.  Given my car is a 2009, its old, Ian and crew definitely babied my car as if it was their own.  Definitely trustworthy, fair, honest, and WORTH THE DRIVE!!!  10 stars to IAN DELOS REYES and the whole crew at Rusnak Audi Pasadena!!!  I AM YOUR CUSTOMER FOR LIFE!</Review>

Additionally they didn’t test the engine oil parts that what they should do. The whole maintenance cost me 600 dollars!!!!!!!!! A local body shop won’t be this expensive. For sure! Even the same quality!

Responsive, transparent, quick but thorough experience.  Larry Gootkin took great care of me in my S5 purchase.  Paperwork was straightforward, and there was no pressure throughout the transaction.  Larry took time for a good test drive, to show me all the car's features, and help set up my phone and the voice control.  Will come back to Rusnak for my next Audi.</Review>

Top notch service! I had my 2018 S5 coupe at another Audi dealer and they were unable to fix the rattle noises coming from the cabin. Decided to try Rusnak Pasadena because they were close to my house and I was starting to regret the purchase of my S5. Right away I noticed a difference in the level of service. Anthony was my service advisor, and he was exceptional at following up with me and keeping me informed on the status of my car. The technician did a great job pin pointing the noise and finally fixing the rattle and creeking noise that had been driving me crazy! Had my car in and out in 2 days and was provided with a courtesy vehicle to drive while it was being fixed. Thanks!</review>

<review>Service is always excellent at Rusnak/Audi. I'd purchased (2) Audi's two years ago and service has always been perfect. We'd arranged with our Service Advisor to have both cars serviced at the same time with the expectations to have a Courtesy car reserved, but when we arrived no Courtesy car was available. Next time I would stagger our automotive services with Rusnak.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><GmapID>0x80c2c375d38c5c81:0x3bfb1f6861a087f<//GmapID><Rate>4<//Rate>< response>

Henry Perez, our assigned service manager, is fabulous. He knows us by name and knows our cars.  It is a pleasure to deal with him.  Our car was well serviced and ready when he said it would be. It would be hard to ask for a better experience.< /Review>

<Review>Omega helped me bought my preowned Audi A5. I am very happy with his service. He talked with me in detail on the phone and text before I went to the store. On the day when we got there, he showed us the car with great patience and walked us through the process. When we finally finishing the purchase and about to drive the car out, we found the carpet inside the car is broken. Omega happily changed a new one for us. Omega is so kind that he even helped me delivered my old car to my place, which is 1.5 hr away from the shop!
I have been having my A5 for a month. I got all the documentation in mail as promised and I enjoyed a lot driving the car <3 I would definitely recommend the shop to my friends and family.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>{'time': 1411508171297, 'text': 'Thank you for the 5-stars!

<text>Who knew you could have a wonderful experience when buying a car? I finally had my first at Rusnak/Pasadena Audi. I told Larry Gootkin which Audi I wanted and told him exactly what I wanted it equipped with. Larry got right on it. He worked tirelessly and was in constant contact with me. He searched until he found exactly what I had asked for. The shocking part? He actually gave me an incredible price. The exact car I wanted at the best price I could imagine. Something no other dealer could do, and all without the usual stress or frustration of buying a car. Larry is so nice, honest, knowledgeable and is excellent in follow up. I felt completely taken care of through the whole process. Car shopping should be fun. It shouldn’t feel like you’re having your teeth pulled. I’m only sorry I can’t buy a car every year. I wouldn’t mind going through this process again each year with Larry. It was a pleasure! People are not so willing to work for their sale these days, and it’s certainly becoming harder to find nice honest people. Do yourselves a favor. If you’re looking for a car, don’t wast time with anyone else. Go to Rusnak/Pasadena.
Thank SO MUCH Larry!!!<//text><GmapID>0x80c2c375d38c5c81:0x3bfb1f6861a087f<//GmapID>< pictures>

<Text>The Service at Rusnak is a tutorial in customer service. They thought out how to welcome you by the way they organized the drive up lanes, the service reps, the cleanliness, professionalism, knowledge, cheerfulness and fairness. I went there because I had a problem with tire pressures and they walked me through how to reset the gage. They showed me where the locking mechanism was for the lug nuts. They told me where to get inexpensive, high quality window tinting done and I was out of there in less than 15 minutes. This guy was so engaging and knowledgeable, we were ready to invite him over for Thanksgiving dinner.</Text>< Rate>

OUTSTANDING service from Rusnak's manager, Shawn Jordan. He took the time to truly listen and accomplish every concern I had. Also great help from serviceman Egan Kwan. Everyone from the lively young woman who checked me in, to a beautiful loaner car was professional and friendly. Congratulations on a fine group of employees!<//Text>

Just bought my dream car at Rusnak. The experience was as good as could be, with much credit going to my sales person, Yolanda Conrad. She's knowledgeable about the Audi lineup and willing to go the extra mile to find the right car for you. After searching through the inventory of current and future stock, she found my dream car in their current inventory,  just at their offsite lot. It was brought over and the negotiations began. I could say "what negotiations?" because the offer she presented me was both transparent and fair. Needless to say, a very happy customer drove home in her dream car that afternoon.< /text>

First time Audi owner...owned BMW s and Lexus  in the past. Very unhappy with the vehicle Q5  and service at Rusnak.  Usually can not get a service appointment for 2-3 weeks out. taken the car in numerous times for the sun/moon roof which rattles relentlessly despite Rusnak attempting to fix it numerous times and replacing it altogether once at about 15,000

Recently took vehicle in for 35,000 service and sun/moon roof rattle not only was the rattle not fixed but the brakes  make so much noise now sounds like I am driving an old u haul truck. Called rusnak to bring it in and they claim I can come in and wait but no loaners available for 2 weeks.  I asked if someone could shuttle me to an enterprise RAC and they said no. Enterprise is no longer on site.

I would not recommend purchasing this model Audi unless noise does not bother you or you want to leave the roof open ( no rattle when open.). Regarding Rusnak service compared to the impeccable service and loaner program I  received from Lexus both here and south Florida ... it’s just horrible< /Text>

<text>David Carter at Rusnak Audi is amazing! He made our car buying experience extraordinary. He was knowledgable, kind, and gave us the best deal possible.

If you're in the market for a new car, even if you're not sure about Audi, stop by. Once you talk to David & learn all he knows about Audi, you'll be sold. It was one of the best car buying experiences I've ever had- no hassle, no headache, and we were in and out with no problems.

I highly recommend David Carter!</text><user>102374606888744232653<//user><Rating>5<//Rating>< name>

Always great service whenever I have to take my car in (which is not very often). Henry is a great service representative and always takes very good care of me. Never a hassle at Rusnak!

Also - Danny Ranft in sales helped me with my new car and he was fantastic!</review>

<rate>1< /rate><Text>Worst experience dealing with a dealership in my life! All I can say is if your traveling from far away (almost 3 hours for me one way) to see a car at this dealership. Don’t waste your time or bother with these people. They claim “first come first serve” but they wont honor that. They will hold a car for you if you simply walk in to look at it AKA someone local to the dealership. Well I was aware that someone else was interested in the car I wanted and was told whoever comes with the money takes the car which makes sense to me. When I arrived Joey or Joe already had the attitude that he wanted to hold the car for the other guy that showed up but wasn’t there when I arrived even though I had my funds squared away and ready to walk away with the car. They said they will reimburse me for wasting my time and gas but I highly doubt it. Stay away from this place like the plague.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

Everything fine except that after I left the dealership having had a major service, a dash warning "low coolant" came on.
I found the coolant low in the reservoir by about 1 1/2 qts. and filled it myself.
No problem since.< /text>

Larry was there to meet me, and was very attentive. I really enjoyed that no one at the dealership was pushy or tried to sell me a car that I didn't want. They only shoes me the car that I was interested in.

<text>Great service I call 5 indy shops be for calling this dealer about flushing my dsg on a 2010 s4 they were all around 460 when the dealer said the almost the same 470 I'd rather spend  just 10 bucks more and have the peace of mind that the fluid, filter, service is all done to spec. They got a shuttle to. You get a text when there done. They even offered to wash my car I'm really picky about how my car is washed but it's nice that they offered. When I picked up the car they was plastic covering the seat and floor. They also took  a video of the out side. documenting the condition of my car. protecting them self form false clames but also protecting me just in case any new damage should happen. If anything breaks Im still going to price check with the indy shops but I'm definitely going to call this dealer right along with the others:)< /text><response>{'time': 1536349347694, 'text': "I'm happy to hear about your positive experience!

I've had 2 Audis, both purchased and serviced at Rusnak Audi. The service experience continues to be excellent, regardless of the service required. Vince is a quality professional that I would highly recommend to anyone looking for an experienced Service Advisor.</review>

I updated my lease with Hector Marin and he's super personable, offered me a great deal and made the whole experience pleasurable and expedient. I will continue to lease my Audi Q5 from Rusnak as long as Audi keeps making great cars!<//text>

I arrived for my appointment, was promptly notified by my service guy Vince that he would be a few minutes, had a cup of coffee and a couple of minutes later was in Vince's office. He explained everything to me up front before I could even ask any questions and made sure that he would do his best to have my car serviced within the time-frame that I asked for.

I came back about a half-hour before the time promised and hung out in the waiting area. Vince walked by, noticed me right away and let me know that my car was being washed and would be ready shortly. Once my car was ready and waiting, Vince called me out, shook my hand and assured me that my car was good to go.

I really felt like I was in good hands with Vince. He will definitely be my service go to
guy in the future.</Text>

<text>I took my car in to service for a tire and wheel without scheduling an appointment. It was urgent. But Vince at Rusnak Pasadena was right on it. The next morning it was fixed (just a tire blow out and some damage to the rim), the car had been checked from one end to the other, the rim scrapes weren't even visible (they have such an outstanding guy who does this), the car was sparkling clean and I was good to go the next morning after dropping it off the late afternoon before.
Thank you, Vince. Thank you Audi Service Dept.<//text><UserId.>109029975678230284688< /UserId.></record>

< review>
I had visited several other Audi dealerships in the SoCal area and I had a pretty good understanding of what I wanted. Audi Rusnak was hands down the best Audi dealership that I visited. Yalonda Conrad was my sales rep and she did an amazing job. For several weeks, I discussed the price of a particular vehicle with her online. She offered me a very competitive deal on this car. Unfortunately, someone else pulled the trigger on it before I could.

Nevertheless, Yalonda found the same car with the same color with even more features at another Audi dealership. Not only was Audi Rusnak able to trade the other dealership for this car, they gave me a very comparable price to the original one I wanted even though this one had a higher MSRP. Yalonda, and her manager, Joe Najar, were very friendly and treated me with the utmost respect throughout this process. I never felt pressured into doing anything. I can't say enough about Rusnak Audi's service.<//review>

<Text>Everyone at the dealership was very courtious and friendly without being overbearing or pushy.  They answered all my questions and they were very easy to deal with.  They didn't have the exact car I wanted on the lot, but they got it for me the next day.  The dealership was extremely busy the day I picked up my car, but the process was still pretty smooth.

I went back to the service department a few days later to have the crossbars mounted and they were great, too.  I didn't even have to get out of the car!  They were very efficient.<//Text><Date>1357722317838</Date>< gmap_id>

<rate>5</rate><Review>From the moment Omega Chambers contacted me about my inquiry for a 2015 Audi A6 3.0T, Prestige Black Optic vehicle, I knew it was going to be a good interaction. He is a standup, class act of an individual. My deal was made very smooth by him, even though I hadn't physically been to the dealership and looked at the car, as he was going to do a dealer trade for it.

Since the entire business transaction was handled over the phone and online, when I got to the dealership to take delivery, all that was required was for me to sign the contract!

I will be doing business with Rusnak Pasadena in the future, no doubt about that.<//Review>< Pics>

I walked in at 4 p.m. on a Saturday and asked to test drive an a4.  Sales representative rudely walked away without informing me if I could test drive one.  After browsing for another 10 ten minutes,  without being greeted by any other employee, I was told that there was no car to test drive and that I would need to make an appointment.

I saw other sales representatives bring cars for other customers to test drive.  Informing me that there was no a4 to test drive on a Saturday afternoon, when I see a lot full of cars, is not only disrespectful but also dishonest.

I highly recommend avoiding this dealership.  The representatives are rude, disrespectful,  and clearly have no interest in doing their jobs.  I have lost all respect for Audi as a brand given the employees they hired and the customer "service" they provide.<//Review>< Pictures>

<review>The sales manager Ray is a POS. i purchased a BMW I8. i Drove Down to California from another state and when i was purchasing the vehicle i told them  i wanted him to pay my sales tax from my state which is idaho at 6% and they said they would do that. well when i signed the contract i didn't really look cause it was a 82K vehicle, and taxes was up there so i just figured it was all ok, well once i looked over my contract they charged me california taxes which i believe is 9.5% and that is almost 3 thousand dollars difference so i just figured id contact them and they would just refund me the difference easy fix. well Ray the sales manager was pretty much saying they were not going to do nothing about it and thats my problem now, so they basically are committing FRAUD and going to steal my money and get more profit off the vehicle. BECAREFUL with this dealership they seem all cool when you are going to buy but after you purchase your vehicle they could car less. I will be contacting the Motor Vehicles about this situation.<//review>< resp>

The experience of leasing a new vehicle was seamless and there was no pressure. We test drove the A4 Quattro, Premium and Premium Plus. Our Internet Sales Rep, Cesar Zavala provided a great experience and educated us on the car we wanted. This is how buying or leasing a vehicle should be!! No pressure. The constant communication from Cesar was great! Thank you Pasadena Audi. We had a great experience during our first Audi lease!</review>< Pics>

I purchased my first Audi in 2009 at Rusnak. My service rep was consistently  helpful and friendly. He always went out of his way to make sure my car was safe when I left the service department. I came back to buy another Audi at  Rusnak because of that great service. My sales experience was just as pleasant.  I felt like the salespeople really wanted me to find a car I would like and there was never any pressure to buy.They got me the car I wanted at the price I wanted. I will definitely recommend them to anyone looking for a new car.<//Review>

I recently upgraded my car and the service provided by Rusnak Audi – was exemplary! I came across the dealership when I bought my first car in the US via Google (so by chance) back in 2011. Five years later and the service is just as good if not better than it was my first time around! As it is my second purchase with this dealership I would say it is with experience – that I highly recommend them for any future car purchases and or trade-ins.  As we all know – it’s the people that make the place and in this case it was Mr. Alex Sirani that made my second stint with the dealership a more enjoyable, professional and informative purchase.  I handed over the old keys given to me 5 years ago and accepted the new set with a pep in my step!<//Review>

<Text>Rusnak Audi has been my Audi dealership for over 20 years... and the experience just gets better and better.  I recently took my car in for its scheduled maintenance.  Johnny B is the BEST! He covers all the bases on what needs to be done, sets me up with a loaner, and sends me on my way.  In a few hours, the car was done, we review the work and a team member rolls up in my freshly washed car.  Rusnak Audi Rules!</Text>< resp>

Audi service is always reliable, trustworthy, stress-free and thorough.  I can truly say, comparing this to the lackluster service I've received on our other car, a Fiat, they don't even come close to how great Audi service is.<//text>

<Text>Horrible sales managers . Horrible customer service
They have poor communication skills and rush you through the lease process without explaining everything to you and then i had to follow up multiple times just to make sure everything was correct when it wasn’t and then they blame it on the customer
My experience has been nothing but horrible
Will never be coming back< /Text>< pictures>

< Review>
I had, by far, the best car buying experience at this dealership! Cesar Zavala quickly responded to all of my numerous text and email questions throughout the entire process. With only an hour’s notice of my arrival, Ricardo Torres found the exact A7 & S7 models I was interested in and conveniently placed them side by side for the ultimate comparison and most comprehensive test drives ever. Pano Argyropoulos then presented me with great quotes on both vehicles, accepted my counter offer on the S7, and took over my previous vehicle before the lease ended without any charges! I highly recommend talking with any of these trustworthy salespeople!</Review>

<Text>My family and I just made a purchase of a Q7. The experience was extremely comfortable. We utilized the Costco Auto Purchase Program which assisted in the ease of the purchase. Salesman Michael Parrish really made our purchase easy, as did Kevin in Finance. All other Rusnak employees we crossed paths with through our afternoon stay, was plesant! All would smile, make eye contact and greet you in a very NICE manner.
Thank you Rusnak!</Text><user_id>116847215985523908162< /user_id>< Pictures>

After having my S4 serviced here I would decidedly recommend avoiding Rusnak for a couple reasons.

Price, these guys were $500 over SM Audi and BH Audi for the same job and parts. I can understand a small delta, but that is a bit extreme. They did work with me a bit, but not enough to make up the delta.

Service, they forgot to complete the work, by resting all the MMI reminders. Not the hugest deal, but it doesn't build a sense of trust that the rest of the work was completed with attention to detail.

Earning people business is more than just saying "I want to earn your business" you actually have to deliver.

Its just one data point so take it for what its worth.

I would highly recommend  Santa Monica Audi or Beverly Hills Audi. Price checked this service with both and have used SM Audi extensively.<//Text>

<Review>Our salesman, Ivan, was the very best I have ever dealt with.  In the past 10 years, we have bought a Lexus GS350 and GX370, a BMW 750 Li and a Subaru Outback 3.6R., all of which were 2-3 year old CPOs.  None were bad experiences, but Ivan was heads above all those experiences.  The credit review, and extended warranty explanation was also clear and concise. We will recommend Rusnak (and Ivan), to all of our friends and acquaintances, and we will be back next time we purchase a vehicle!< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Name>Duane Barnes< /Name><Rate>5< /Rate></record>

<Review>I recently purchased my A3 TDI from Rusnak Audi after visiting two other Audi dealers. I worked with Michael Phelan after exchanging emails and phone calls over the course of a few weeks. He always answered my questions without pressuring me into buying something I didn't really want or need. The pricing was more than fair and I always felt like a valued customer. I liked their service so much I convinced my mom to buy her Audi at Rusnak. She's the proud owner of a new A6 thanks to Michael and the Rusnak Audi team.<//Review>< Date>

I am very happy with the service department at Rusnak Audi in Pasadena.  Vince Stamegna is my service advisor and has been nothing less than excellent in providing top level customer service.  I purchased the car over 2 years ago and have always been offered a loaner, they also offer courtesy transportation, have a comfortable waiting area if it's a quick service, and as far as my experience goes, everyone there has been very attentive.  My recollection of purchasing the vehicle was pleasant, but in regards to the more important long term relationship of maintaining your vehicle, the service department is where dealers prove their worth and I have been very happy with Rusnak Audi.</Review>

We purchased a Q5 with Rick at Rusnak Pasadena in September 2015. We have to say Rick is great, helpful and knowledgeable. He followed up several time after we made the purchase and our communication has always been efficient and effective. This review is not about our experience with Rick.

The awful nightmare started with Kevin Khourjian, the finance manager at this dealership. First, we were lured into the Audi Term Care Select package during the purchase, and he promised that we could cancel it in a month and get full refund. So we did some studies afterward and decided to cancel this package. This was still within the one-month period he promised, and we never used any of the service from the package. We called Kevin on Oct 12, 2015, faxed and emailed him the form and a written notice. First, I have to say he was very impatient over the phone. Since I understand the psychology here, I didn’t make it a big deal. On the phone, we were told explicitly that the service package was cancelled, but he had no written confirmation to show us. All we could to do was to wait and the refund would appear on the loan principle. So we waited for 3 months, but nothing happened…

On Jan 2, 2016 we took the car to this dealership for maintenance and got a chance to talk to Kevin in person. The moment I walked into his office, I saw my faxed paperwork sitting on top of his cabinet. I asked him about the case progress, he replied, “oh some documents got lost and that paperwork was never processed.” Seriously? So why were we told the cancellation was done three months ago in the beginning? Even if “some documents” were lost, he had three months to call us or emailed us about that, but he did NOTHING.

After the struggling conversation, Kevin said he would process the paperwork again. We asked for his business card and left the dealership hoping this is the last time we spend time on it. But to be honest, we can hardly trust what he SAYs anymore, even if he called us right after we left the dealership to confirm that he has taken action. So we waited for another FIVE weeks, and we were right, NOTHING happened. I called his office three times, left voice messages, never heard back from him.

We used to have great trust in our dealership, at least expecting people to deal with things in a professional manner. We thought AUDI represents not only a standard for high-end driving experience, but also its superior customer service. Unfortunately, it is clearly NOT the case at this dealership, if not the opposite. I think this dealership pays great attention on getting new customers, but once you are in, what so called “SERVICE” becomes a big joke. Many of you have the money to buy expensive cars, but how much time do you have to waste on this kind of post-purchase “service”? Think twice!</Text>

<pics>None</pics><Review>From my first visit at this dealership, I have had nothing but great experiences. They whole team of sales and finance were so friendly and efficent! I applied online and got a call from the intenet sales manager that same day. By that evening we were driving 2 hours from where we live to go pick up our car. When we got there everything that we had discussed on the phone and via email was exactly as our salesman, Michael, said it was going to be. When your dealing with car salesmen it is so refreshing when you know you are dealing with someone you can trust and sticks to their word. All my paperwork was prepared a head of time so the whole process from start to finish took a little over an hour, which was amazing! After the sale was complete, my salesman Michael, went above and beyond to ensure I knew all the features of my new car. I would recommend this auto dealership to anyone who is looking for an friendly and smooth experience when purchasing a car.< /Review>< resp>

He was professional, kind and helpful all the way through.  He listened to my needs and worked very hard to meet them while also getting me on LA's streets in style.  Because Cesar and his colleagues conduct business with integrity, I will return myself and refer all my friends to buy cars from this dealership!< /Review>< pics>

We had a great experience at Rusnak Audi.  Ivan Lai, the sales consultant, is a great guy, very professional, to the point, made the experience enjoyable, and the negotiation painless. He brought the vehicle to our home and spent time in explaining every minor detail.  Rusnak Audi are a good group of people doing a good job.</text>

<text>This is the second time in a row I come back to Rusnak- Audi in Pasadena for 2 different purchases. I have a family member who works at a different Audi dealer and I came back to see Koni, here at Rusnak-Audi. Koni is... amazing! Well, everyone at this dealer is but Koni, specifically. He took great care of me. For me to say I came to Koni instead of going with my family should speak volumes of him. Another great person who worked with me on my 2018 S4 was Matthew Dowley. He is approachable, personable, and very well-rounded when it comes to the tech specs on my car. Thank you guys!<//text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

I cannot recommend Audi Rusnack Pasadena.  After my Audi Q7 stalled and stopped on the freeway with my children in the backseat, the Audi Service Dept told me it was a manufacturing defect in the gas tank.  Meanwhile, I spent $700 on a rental car.  This afternoon (3 days after receiving the car), it broke down in the middle of the street.  This time fuel was spilling out of the engine, so much so, the Fire Dept showed due to the odor.  For your safety, please consider another dealer.</Review>

<time>1394975741821< /time><Rating>5</Rating><review>I test drove and purchased an Audi A6 Prestige from Beshoy Abdou and found the overall experience to be great.  His initial contact (for me via email) was quick, and he responded back to an appointment time for me to test drive two separate cars.  He met me and had both cars ready to test drive.  He was very pleasant, professional and easy to work with.  There were no high-pressure sales tactics used, and we worked out a deal that I was very happy with over a series of emails that same day.

When I came to pick up the car the next day, the car looked great, and he went over in great detail all the technology features of the car and the sales details.  He noticed that during the preparation of the car that the tank wasn't filled and he took care of it immediately while I went over financing with Gladys.  Gladys, incidentally, was also very pleasant and helpful and had all of our paperwork ready to go and we were in and out in minutes.

Beshoy is well-versed on all functions of the A6 and went over everything.  He constantly checked with me and made sure all of my needs were attended to.  Great guy, great dealer.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures></record>

< review>
I needed professional help. After 8 years living in London without any need for a car, I was moving back to the US and needed to get a new car. Before arrival, I did my research and was reasonably certain I wanted an Audi S5 Sportback. But I certainly wouldn't buy it without driving it. I'll be living in Pasadena, so wanted to go to the local dealer, which is Rusnak. I got in touch with Ricardo Torres a few weeks before moving back to Pasadena, and he was brilliant in helping explain leasing options and getting us preapproved while we were still in the UK. One day after we arrived in LA, I was test driving a few Audi models for comparisons. Ricardo Torres was great at getting us acquainted with the new cars and new technologies. The performance of the S5 convinced me it was indeed the right car for me. Ricardo helped us stay calm and collected throughout the leasing process. He was always there to answer any of our questions, was knowledgeable about the S5, and helped us navigate our choices. The financing process was also very smooth. And when we picked up the car, we had an excellent technology lesson from Matthew Dowley to help us understand the tech aspects. Working with Ricardo Torres was a real pleasure. After nearly 10 years without even needing a car, I needed to be brought into the 21st century, and we couldn't be happier with our new S5 or with the excellent customer service from Rusnak. I would definitely recommend Ricardo Torres if you are looking for a great guide.<//review>

This is my first review ever and I wish I could say it was for different reasons.  This particular Audi service department is run with the mentality of crocks.  I recently took my car in for service due to a bad battery and had looked on Audi Rusnaks website for any service deals.  To my delight I found one that states they will match any other service deals.  I then showed one of the associates the 15% off the Audi Van Nuys was offering and was told they would match with no issue.  Super, I think to myself. I then get a text saying when my car is done so I stop in to pick it up later that day.  When I go to pay the 15% has not been applied.  I think to myself honest mistake and explain the story to the ladies at the checkout counter.  They don't have the power to put it in so Jason(miserable human in general) comes over and says he doesn't remember telling me this.  I then explain to him that I spoke with the other associate that he passed me onto, because he is clearly a big deal and did not have time to finish my car check in.  I explain to him we need to call the lady I spoke with about the discount.  He says what was her name...I have no clue, bub.  I then have to wait for the manager to peek his crooked a-- out of his office to tell me they will honor the 15%.  Geee, thanks a bunch.  I think I saved a whopping $60...list customer at this point too.  I then get in my car to drive home and don't think to look in my center console for my sunglasses because it's dark out.  However the next morning I'm driving East on the 210 and need my sunglasses so I flip up the center console and nothing...benefit of the doubt is given and I go home that night to look around my apartment...no sunglasses found and I know I didn't have them in the loaner.  Hmmmm what could have happened.  I stop back in to Audi and of course this is the first this has happened with the new manager.  He offers me Audi sunglasses.  Thanks but no thanks.  I haven't had my mid life crisis yet.
P.S. - this is on top of the time they tried to charge me $800+ for a CPO covered repair.  I'm sure they do this with a lot of people who don't throughly look over there bills.
-Lesson learned here is AUDI RUSNAK PASADENA is terribly managed and don't waste your time going here.  1 star because I have to.  *This is a real review*<//text>

< review>
If I hope I could give zero start,  The sales guy named "Alex" is definitely the worst sales I ever met for all my 5 car purchase experience in my life. Super Unprofessional ' My friend and I got Rusnak Audi around 4pm for leasing a Q7 SUV (they close at 9pm) .  Alex was the one who "took care" of us. First of all he didn't even introduce himself until I asked him about 10 mins later, likewise he never ask what's our names ?! When we ask if we can see a car that in their stock (2 miles) he told us he don't want to go since it's traffic ???? He never asked as for test drive either and also he told us HE HAS TO LEAVE BY 6PM and he don't want to stay just because he dont want ???? !!!!! He doesn't want to explain any numbers on the price he offered to us , just by saying this was from the system and it's how it suppose to be and he didn't know the items or detail.
If you don't want to sale a car then DONT BE A SALES !!!! This is totally wasting our time !!!!!<//review>

I had an effortless buying experience at Audi Rusnak of Pasadena thanks in part to Danny Ranft and his genuine eagerness to please. His knowledgable experience helped cut through all the b.s. and got me the exact car I wanted all while being incredibly patient. Will definitely be coming back.<//review>

<review>DECEPTIVE SALES PRACTICES.  STAY AWAY from this dealership.  The represent things that are just not true.  I purchased a car that was supposed to have Audi Care and it ended up not having the services that they represented that I would have.  Then, the guy who handles it lied flat out and threatened me.  Nasty people.  Go elsewhere.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures></record>

We visited Rusnak Audi and they showed us the Audi A5 Cabriolet we liked, gave us a test drive, answered our questions, all knowing we would not be back for a few months when our current car would be at the end of its lease.
With that impression in mind we did return two months later.  We worked with Danny Ranft and Warren Chen.  Took another test drive, negotiated the price we wanted without too much hassle and drove out that day with a new Audi A5 Cabriolet.
We were treated well, not too much playing around with price, got a great car, and a tutorial on the instrument panel and all the bells and whistles.
We'll be back next year when it's time to replace our other car.</text><pics>None</pics>< response>

<review>we first dealt with adam, who was excellent.  we did our test drive of the vehicle we ultimately purchased with him.  when we returned, adam was off so we did the purchase through ernnie, adam's partner.  they were both great, competent and knowledgeable, but not pushy.
this was our fifth rusnak audi car and by far our easiest purchase process.  I highly recommend both adam and ernnie.</review>< Response>

I was scheduled for a 5,000 mile service on Friday, but my tire pressure light came on on Sunday.  As fully booked as Rusnak was for Monday, my service 'buddy,' Henry Perez not only managed to squeeze in service for the immediate problem, but also for the check which was to have taken place Friday, so that I had to make only the one trip.  THANK YOU HENRY!!!< /text>

Everyone at Rusnak Audi is very nice. But, my rating is "good" rather than "great".  I have arrived at three consecutive service appts with the same concern. "My Audi Q5 sunroof rattles".  The first time I was told they "couldn't replicate it". The 2nd time I drove with the technician and he heard it. The rattle continues so the last time I arrived I told the service manager not to open the sunroof until they heard the rattle.  When the car was ready I was told "they forgot to listen before they opened the sunroof" but I should "come back and drive with the technician".  I am very frustrated as given the results of my internet search indicates that this is a "known issue".  I should not have to bring this up over and over and certainly shouldn't have to give up more of my time to drive around with a technician who has ears and can hear the rattle.<//Review>

My experience at Rusnak/Pasadena Audi is ALWAYS EXCELLENT WITH VINCE!!!! I have the Best Reprenative there....VINCE IS THE BEST!!!!!! He makes sure my car's needs are taken care of in a percise and  timely manner. I drive into Pasadena  from Palmdale, Ca, just to have Vince service my Audi A-4 because he knows how to get the job done right!!!! Knowledgable and polite, Vince's assistance, patience, and professionalism make my experience better than satisfactory......OUTSTANDING!!!!
I leave your establishment with a smile on my face and a feeling of security. That 's an Awesome Thing......Thanks Vince!!!!!</Review>

Bought my car 100% online from Rusnak and had the best car buying experience to date.  I've never done a deal via phone,internet but it worked out great and Omega did an amazing job both for his dealership and the customer.  I enjoyed working with Omega and over the course of the week we both negotiated a deal that I couldn't be happier with.  I almost walked away from the deal but Omega brought me back in several times and kept me at the table.  He knew how to keep the conversation going and how to keep the deal alive.  Omega pushed at the right times and gave me space at the right times as well.  In the end he sold me the car I wanted at the Price I had budgeted for.

The care was a used SUV and when it arrived at my house at 10:30pm after we agreed to terms earlier that evening it was perfect.  I've purchased several used high end cars before and this one was impeccable beyond belief.  You can tell that Rusnak takes pride in all of it's cars before putting their name on it.  The car was literally brand new and expertly detailed.  I was equally impressed when Omega and Jose drove up 1 hour and 45 minutes to deliver me the car the night we closed the deal.  Both were extremely polite, knowledgeable and helpful.

This was honestly the most fun I have ever had buying a car and look forward to always coming to Rusnak 1st whenever I'm in the market!

High Service - High Professionalism - Great Cars!</Text>

< Review>
I am extremely satisfied with Rusnak Audi of Pasadena.  I contacted them (after hours) through the internet on  a recent listing for a CPO 2014 RS5.  I received an immediate response from Cesar letting me know they were closed and he would contact me the following morning. The next day I spoke to Cesar, arranged an appointment to look at the car, and arranged financing before hand.  I arrived the same afternoon, took the car for a drive, fell in love, and signed the necessary paperwork.  The whole process took no time at all.  The bottom line is Rusnak Audi of Pasadena was professional, courteous and made the car buying experience simple and headache free.  If anyone is in the market for an Audi, I urge you to contact Cesar at Rusnak.</Review>

Arbi was exceptional. We have bought several cars throughout the years and never felt so comfortable. He made the whole process extremely simple and painless. We actually sent our 16 year old son to get our mini van appraised. None of the dealerships we sent him to took him seriously except Rusnak. Arbi appraised our mini van and treated our 16 year old like an adult. That was one of the main reasons we bought the car the next day. Arbi is a true professional. He even delivered our new Audi to our house the next day. Best car buying experience.<//Review>

8 years later and probably my 5th or 6th car through Rusnak Audi, I thought I should update my review. Warren Chan has moved to another brand, still with Rusnak. My contact at Audi is now Karsten Tschaepe who is just as excellent. Just got a Q5 hybrid working with Karsten and could not have been happier with the experience. Go see Karsten....he will take care of you!!!

********************
I purchased my second Audi Q5 at Rusnak Audi recently.  My first experience was pretty good.  My second one with Warren Chen, was even better.  Warren is so nice and friendly.  He deals with you sincerely and courteously.  Best of all, I had a document issue with the refinancing of my mortgage shortly after I purchase the vehicle and he went out of his way to help be redraft the lease contract.  He is a really decent human being so if you need a new car, go see Warren Chen at Rusnak Audi.< /text><pics>None</pics><response>{'time': 1620779404882, 'text': "Hi Becky, we can't thank you enough for your positive review and loyal business!

<Review>Our Family has been doing business with Rusnak Audi in Pasadena for past nine years. The sales department under Ephrem Yohannes  has been superb. Whether ordering, purchasing off the lot, or leasing, he has made the process both enjoyable and hassle-free.

The service department under Henry Perez and Johnny Borja is what has made us repeat customers. The professionalism, cleanliness, and quality of service is impeccable. If a problem does ever occur, they are always up front and quickly willing to go the extra mile to resolve any issue under their control (or out of their control).

I recently took our Audi in for service. The moment I arrived, Henry was there to greet me, listen to my needs, sit me down in his office offering coffee or bottled water, explain (to my satisfaction) what service was needed and when it would be done, offering a ride home, and then sincerely taking the time to inquire about my family. A true professional and good man.
Thank you Rusnak< /Review><pics>None< /pics><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x80c2c375d38c5c81:0x3bfb1f6861a087f</Gmap_id></record>

Larry Vena has been my service rep for that past few years and it's amazing how personalized his service is....I wanted to buy him a box of cigars but he doesn't smoke. :)  When I dropped my car off, he remembered my cell phone doesn't work well in the office and he already had my work number memorized....amazing!  I'm truly blown away by Larry and the entire Audi service team....I just wish I could see him more frequently but with so few issues, I only see him at the service intervals.

Ernnie Chan, Danny Ranft and Omega Chambers on the sales team at Rusnak Pasadena helped me negotiate and tie up a deal that was both fair and expeditious. I'll definitely return, and I recommend Rusnak to anyone looking for an Audi. In the Service department, Johnny Borja always exceeds expectations.< /review>< user_name>

< Review>
It was about as painless a car buying experience as I've ever had.  I also had done a fair amount of homework prior to going to Rusnak.  Kyriakos "Koni" Koniotis, Brand Specialist, was personable, accommodating and efficient.  He was able to get my requested trade in price with little trouble.  Keti Ludzheva, Finance Manager, stayed late to help finish the process.  We walked in at 7:30pm and left with a CPO 2012 Q5 S-line.  I also met and spoke with Daniel Allen, Brand Specialist, and Eric Witt, Sales Manager.  Great team at Rusnak!  I love my new ride!< /Review>

I had called and set up a meeting with a sales associate named Akrem to take a look at the car to make sure it was something I really wanted.  Akrem was very friendly, professional, and knowledgeable when it came to answering all my questions.

In the end, Akrem and his sales manager, Ray, were able to get me an amazing deal on the car that I love!</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

I boat used Lexus HS250H at Rusnak Audi week ago.
NIce service, no pressure from sales person Arbi Josephian.
Car is in the excellent condition and at fair price.
Good price for my trade in Camry 2007.
Only positive impressions!<//text>

Took my vehicle in for service to Rusnak a couple of days ago and was assisted by Johnny Borja who was one of the service consultants.  I cannot express the professionalism and attention that he gave towards the servicing of my vehicle.  He kept me informed as to when the vehicle would be ready and assisted me in getting a rental vehicle with Enterprise.

Leon assisted me with the Enterprise vehicle which I again was pleasantly pleased with the excellent service that he demonstrated to get me into a vehicle so as not to inconvenience me in anyway until my vehicle was finished.

Then as my daughter and I were looking at vehicles in the showroom we were approached by Ivan Lai a Brand Specialist at Rusnak.  Ivan was not overly aggressive but ever so politely persistant and the next thing I know we are taking a test drive in one of the vehicles.  Shortly after that we are now speaking with Kevin who is in finance and also excellent at what he does and we end up driving away in a new car.  AMAZING!!!!!
Never would I have ever imagined that this would have taken place but it was definitely contributed to the excellent people working at Rusnak.

If you want to be treated well I would definitely refer you to Rusnak in Pasadena.  If I could give them 10 stars I would but only five are accepted!</Text>

Yoda - the very unassuming representative from Rusnak Audi Pasadena made my buying experience @ RUSNAK fun, positive, and stress free.  Our family loved his name, Yoda, and his last name includes JEDI in it, but it's Masjedi.  For those of you looking or interested in an Audi, you be wise to ask for Yoda, and I promise you, he will not be at his seat or desk because he will be running around doing whatever it takes to make his clients have the best experience, but just patient, you will be happy you waited!  Thanks Rusnak & Thanks Yoda.  I love my A8!!!</Text><gmapID>0x80c2c375d38c5c81:0x3bfb1f6861a087f<//gmapID><pictures>None< /pictures></record>

My wife and I were looking to trade in our Audi convertible for an allroad due to our growing family.  As I looked around on autotrader, I reached out to all the local Audi dealers.  Cesar Zavala from Rusnak was quick to respond and most informative.  It took about 3 weeks before we were ready to pull the trigger and Cesar did a great job of keeping in touch, but not in an annoying way, just in a way that made us feel like he truly wanted our business.  At the end, we were between two cars - one at Beverly Hills Audi (a lot closer to home) and one at Rusnak.  Cesar bent over backwards to get us a great deal and even better service that it made it worth driving out to Pasadena.  And while the transaction took longer than anticipated, due to circumstances outside Cesar's control, he did everything to make my pregnant wife, our dog Cookie and I comfortable and well attended too.  It is that kind of service that has earned our business now and in the future.</review>

Fantastic Experience and my salesperson Danny Ranft made it fun and easy. He was very thorough in explaining all my options and took me through my car entirely. I would highly recommend Danny Ranft. My First Audi is an A4 2.0T Quattro Premium Package! Nav / Sirrius / & 60GB Jukebox / SD card slots and Sunroof. An entirely new driving experience over my Nissan Sentra 2013 even though its a 2012 Audi it blows away that Nissan Sentra SR. Sweet Car !!< /Text>

Worst service ever, they just want to sell you a car and are willing to lie in order for you to purchase a car. I was told I could install LED lights in the car there at the dealer. I bought the car and now I'm told that is NOT possible.<//text>

Easiest Car purchase I've ever experienced. I bought many Audis over the years and I got a great deal on a New 2021 Q5 for my wife as a wedding gift. Highly recommend this place and Rick is the salesman that took care of everything. Best deal best rate super easy transaction. Had the car delivered with a big red bow and everything! Thank you again Rick! Definitely be buying my dad car soon!</Text>
