<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>My sweetheart and I came to celebrate our anniversary yesterday. We felt like we traveled to Napoli in Italy as soon as we arrived. Francisco, our waiter was friendly, professional and knowledgeable with a great sense of humor. The interior design is beautiful, the atmosphere excellent and the wine and food exceptional. I am from France and both my parents were chef and pastry chef respectively: I was exposed to delicious food growing up and traveled a lot to Italy. Chef Sandro came to see us and we talked about our childhoods in Europe with Karen. He is a master at his craft and delivers the very best Italian food that I have had in California. I highly recommend Bello!<//Text>< pics>

Nice outdoor patio , plus classy indoor seating.  Menu is different than classic Italian restaurants. We had apetizers,  octpus, big tiger shrimp and pork belly. Main dished Pollo croccante and pesce spada, everything  was excellent. Dessert Panna cotta. Main waiter is Italian  very prepared and fast .<//text>

Eat and feel like you are in Italy. From the fresh baked sour dough bread and incredibly delicious olive oil to the dinner and wine. Perfect. Reasonable prices, comfortable seating, patio with fireplace, spacious interior. Menu changes weekly according to chef/owner Sandro. We look forward to eating here many more times.< /text>

<Rating>2</Rating><text>We attended the dinner and wine pairing event at Bello last night with a group of friends. I would like to start by acknowledging our awesome servers and the fun atmosphere provided. All in all we had a very good time. The wines served were very nice reasonably priced selections that we all enjoyed. Unfortunately, some of the dishes served did not meet the same standard. The blue crab appetizer was fantastic. The nochi was also very good. I enjoyed the duck while some of our group did not. The steak was not good. It was very salty and completely raw on some of our plates. Most of our group complained about the dish and didn't eat it. The desert was the worst. It looked like a spoonful of chocolate soup poured onto a plate. At $100 a head we expected a little more than we received from a restaurant known for delicious meals and impressive presentations. This was not the case at Bello last night.< /text><Time>1617930832773</Time></record>

PURE BLISS!! No words to describe the sensations of savory flavors, textures, delightful twists in Chef Nardone's cuisine. This is the perfect spot for a date night, a family night out, or a special celebration like ours. We were celebrating our honeymoon and looking for a delicious Italian restaurant. Little did we know that we were about to have our hearts filled with happiness and our palates delighted.

We started with the crudo. Amazingly fresh. As you savor the subtle flavors, a pop of lemon brightens your taste. It's flavorful with none of the bitterness one normally expects from a lemon.

Next, we selected the pork belly.  The crispy textures we enjoyed were crunchy and light, combined with the heat of of the spicy peppers and the perfectly cooked pork made the dish a treat. We eat a lot of Korean cuisine, and then Onions, fresh mint, and basil, reminded us of the freshness we enjoy from banchan, which brought a freshness to the dish.

For the pasta, every dish looked incredible with a twist. I would have ordered multiple pastas per person if we had the stomach space for it.  All of their pasta is made fresh in house, and you absolutely can taste the difference.

We started with the Amatriciana. Pasta was cooked to perfection. The pork brought a lovely depth of flavor and texture - another delightful surprise as you experience the dish. I recommend closing your eyes and really enjoying the flavors and textures.

Next was the Norcina - a beautifully light dish with perfectly cooked pasta seasoned with truffle and porcini mushrooms, with the pasta cooked to perfection. We savored every bite, hoping the next would not be our last.

For dessert, we finished with two experiences. The first was a vanilla gelato served as an affogato. The gelato was light yet smooth, and perfectly paired with the espresso. Next, our favorite, a beautifully prepared light yuzu custard topped with pistachios and black sesames, and maraschino cherries. I wanted to lick the plate!! As you enjoy each spoonful, the brightness of the yuzu with the burst of sweetness from the cherries brought layers and layers of flavors.

We are planning to bring our parents, relatives, friends, and guests who are willing to journey with us from LA to visit here. I can promise you will go away with a happiness that goes beyond the food and exceptional customer service. We can't wait to visit again and go on another culinary adventure. Bravissimo!  Thank you for making our honeymoon dinner one we will cherish forever.< /review>

<Review>Between the food and the service this is the closest you’ll get to Italy in Newport Beach. The shrimp starter is amazing (I’m not sure the name.) I don’t eat shrimp but I ended up stealing half of it from my boyfriend. Great atmosphere and happy to be back to indoor dining.<//Review><time>1616907003391< /time>< Response>

<review>What I also tried - BELGIAN FRIES and TOASTED APPLE PIE ICE CREAM SANDWICH
For the same price, skip the side and order the Toasted Apple Pie Cream Sandwich. The cookies in the sandwich are oatmeal cookies. Something bland from the oatmeal and something sweet & tart from the apple. It was surprisingly amazing.</review>< Pictures>

<Text>Food is amazing here.  Menu changes frequently but the chef gave ua multiple fantastic flavors.  We had already amazing shrimp and perfect octopus.  But the real star of the evening was the main courses.  The pasta mains were all off the charts delicious.   The only reason that this is a 4 is that the atmosphere was lacking.   Highly recommended for food lovers.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x80dcdf5b3a646d7f:0xecb268a8794574c< /Gmap_id></record>

Welcomed by the modern vibe, the restaurant are furnished with two prime colors black and grey. Chefs and staffs are super friendly and knowledgeable. Every dish is Italian authentic and delicious. Hands down for the most juicy prok chop and creative my favorite panna cotta. But don't forget to add grilled octopus to appetizers.< /Text>

Tremendous pasta here. Best I have had in orange county. The aglio olio and the pomodoro were really good. It might sound simple, but it was done to perfection. I also really enjoyed the carrots with pistachio puree.<//review>

<review>We really recommend this restaurant. They had just opened before Covid. They had to close but now it is open. Tables more than 6 feet apart.

<text>Wow.... this place is off the chart. If you're looking for authentic modern Italian flavor, this is the place to go. I love to take my date here. Not only the food is exceptional but aslo their interior design. The stuff are so friendly and they provide great service.<//text>< pictures>

<text>I had to give them five stars because the food was very good. We had a couple of minor issues that were server related but that is probably to be expected with a place that has been open for two weeks. Once they get a couple of minor issues sorted this is going to be a really special place. The food was terrific!< /text><Name>John Burns<//Name>< user_id>

Had super high expectation for Farm based on pictures, reviews, and menu. If I could I would give 3 and a half, with the potential for a 4+ as we get further along the opening of businesses during the lockdown.

COVID reopening issues:
They were not offering any of their craft cocktails, and after reading all of the great reviews about them one of our guests (the birthday girl) was looking forward to trying one. But they unfortunately don't offer them right now, even though there is a full bar open. We were told that they are in the middle of revamping all of their specialty cocktail menu, so they neither offered the ones they did before, or any new ones. They said you could just order a normal cocktail and they would make it. It just seems weird that while your creating a new cocktail menu that you would not offer the current ones in the meantime. Also, they only had diet coke and sprite and no other sodas.

Could just be a COVID issue in terms of different bartenders or massive time and cost of prepping the bar for specialty cocktails. I expect this to not be an issue moving forward and that the new menu will be fantastic.

Food:
The food was good. Octopus (pulpo) was out of this world good, as advertised in many other reviews. We got ours cooked a bit more crispy. Which works out well because its served over some delicious sauteed greens with a sauce and that is wet, so the dish is not too dry with a bit more of a cook on the octopus. Gorgonzola salad was also super good, they do not skimp in the cheese. Dare I say maybe too much gorgonzola? Nah, I would never! Pizzas I thought were extremely wet and soggy and were OK taste wise. I like a thin crispy crust though, and the rest of our table seemed to really like them. The pasta was good, very al dente, but at a place like this I expected it to be better than good. Based on reviews and the modern Italian theme I just had crazy high expectations for the pasta especially. Flavors were great though so if I go again I will ask them to cook it a little more, although....

A warning, we were told that the kitchen chef's will not make any changes to anything on the menu. We tried to get gorgonzola on the side when we ordered the salad so that my wife could share some of my salad and because she does not like blue cheese, but were told that they would not do that for us.

Service + Overall:
The service was great, everyone was very good to us and generally had a warm and inviting vibe. We were checked on by multiple people and when we had some issues with a wine we ordered they quickly and very willingly took care of it and made everyone happy. Our waiter was great and very funny.

I expect, as restaurants all struggle with reopening, that Farm can and will iron out issues. I appreciated everyone there and we had a great time at dinner.<//review>

Outstanding, including the decor, cocktails, wine, food, presentation and service.  The cocktails are innovative and varied but with an Italian essence. Likewise the food, which I would not call traditional. The menu is small but ample and varies daily, though I could use more red wine by the glass, and deserts (they had only Tiramisu).
Overall, has immediately become my favorite OC Italian restaurant.<//Text>

<review>It is a resturaunt that you should come to expecting and wanting to experience a delicate yet powerful form of flavor. It is not your typical high sodium high octane American flavor experience, and that is what makes it special. If you like fish the Crudo is an amazing appetizer.< /review>< pics>

<review>Love this place, the pasta is made fresh and  the atmosphere is really up scale, the cocktails are pricy but worth it. I ordered some pasta to go during covid-19 and it just wasn't as good as I remember from dining in. I'll be going back again soon.< /review>< Pics>

Jose & Jason are great employees, easy process to switch from Verizon to AT&T. Jason is a Red Sox fan but I won't hold that against him. Jose is such a good sales person that somehow I ended up buying 10 screen protectors (I only have one iPhone). Thanks guys.</text>

<text>Terrible service. These people are rip offs! Gonna go to T mobile now! People of the valley, DO NOT get ATT they are cheats! I filed an insurance claim on my phone and when I sent my defective phone back they said it was lost in the mail and that now I have to pay them $800. Not my fault USPS lost my box! Now they shut off my phones to forcefully kick us out of my great grandfathered plans! I’ve had ATT for over 20 years and they’re crying for something that is far beyond my control! Great way to treat a loyal customer. Customers beware of hidden costs and hidden strings! Don’t get ripped off. I just can’t believe these people would do this to my family!<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80daf766272cd593:0x7a95ec097453bf6d<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>Went it because my wife's phone broke and we just had a baby so we needed a phone ASAP. Sal greeted us and was not only friendly but efficient. He took the time to listen to what we needed and made sure we were getting the best deal. Put us on a better plan and got us HBO MAX for FREE! He had Danny who was also wonderful ring us up and got us all set up. This was a definite the dynamic duo you read about. Great job guys I will definitely come back!</review>< Rating>

I would definitely recommend going to see Melissa at the indio store. She was not only understanding but the most kind and professional AT&T employee I have ever encountered. After going to other stores and talking to customer care i was ready to cancel all my lines and go to Verizon. Melissa took the time to work with her Manager Sal and find a solution to my problem. Not only did i stay with AT&T but i got myself a new phone and added a line for my son. Do yourself a favor and go see Melissa!!< /Text>

9/6/19 2:45pm - I went to this store to upgrade my phone. I spoke with only one gentleman who took my name and asked if I had an appointment. Verified that I didn’t schedule an appointment. He made sure I was aware that I would have to wait possibly 10-20 minutes until a sale rep becomes available. As time passed. Several people became available and the man who got my info. disappeared (possibly went to break) but I was standing there thinking he communicated with the other employees about me. One gentleman came in and was assisted immediately. From that point, I just walked out and decided to have my business elsewhere. Not the best place to do service.<//Review>

<rate>1</rate><text>My galaxy s5 stopped charging. I plugged it in and got a yellow triangle with a exclamation mark in the middle.
I took it into AT&T and they told me the phone was dead and I needed to replace it. Well this phone was like seven or eight hundred dollars and I wasn't willing to put out that much money right away without further investigation.  I look it up on google what the yellow triangle meant it said there was a battery problem. Of course, aT&T does not sell the batteries. We wouldn't even let me try one to see if my phone was charged. They said they didn't have any they are all brand new and couldn't open the package.  The salesman was quite persistent saying, for only $17 a month I can give you a new phone. Like I really want to pay $17 a month for several years.  I went home, cleaned the battery connections and now my phone works perfectly. AT&T sucks<//text>< Pics>

<Review>Maria was great. I went into into the store to have my Samsung phone activated after I switched it over from Verizon.  The first ATT representative was of no help since she claimed I need tech support to activate my phone or that it may be locked to Verizon only.  Maria took the time to investigate the problem further and found out that my VPN settings were incorrect. She changed the settings and it worked! Hi five to Maria. As for the other rep, she needs more training and/or effort in customer care.<//Review>< Pics>

<review>Completely unhelpful personnel.  I'm traveling and my phone won't hold a charge and their suggestion was to go to another location with AT&T WiFi to run some updates or sell me an expensive case that also charges the phone. This is just one more experience that justifies our company moving our 200 plus wireless phones to another carrier.<//review><GmapID>0x80daf766272cd593:0x7a95ec097453bf6d<//GmapID>< userid>

Service was extremely poor, employees kept going back stating they had to go consult with supervisor. I was there to state I was having trouble with the audio/speaker on my 2 week old phone. It was still under warranty and I was unable to hear people calling me unless I used some headphones. Otherwise it was worthless to have a conversation. It took 50 minutes of going back & forth to the back to came out of there with an 800 number for customer for they could not help. It took them almost an hour, couldn't they tell me this in the first 5-10 mins? They were totally incompetent but I'm sure I'm not the only dissatisfied customer. Since I saw other customers leaving irrate.<//text>

Worst experience ever, I waited for over 30 minutes and after is my turn they just skipped me and did not want to help, very rude employees, I thought custumer service was their priority but I guess they dont car about customers.<//Review>

<Text>Worst experience from a General Manager at the Jackson store, I walk-in to purchase, the G.M. gives me an attitude cause I asking why few questions on workers who help in the store, one customer just left, he tells me to wait, one his workers just finish with a customer, there's a lady behind me on the TV screen list of walk-ins, the G.M. At Indio said he could not help me or the sign in person, had to wait but instead he helps the lady behind me on the waiting list instead, all because I see one of his workers with the iPad finish with a customer then helps another co-worker to help her Client and the G.M. At The Jackson store is giving me an attitude SOME CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!!!< /Text>< name>

It was so savory. Definitely worth a return trip. The prices are well within reason for the quality. Mood here reminds me of San Diego's scene.< /review>

Talk about a classy place. The Squire Room may only be open a few nights a week but man do they make up for it with a quality establishment.  The owners are there every night serving up delicious drinks and lively conversation.  I've never met a more pleasant couple to hang out with after a long day at the office.<//review>

The bartenders are fantastic, very knowledgeable and can make great recommendations. It's a smaller bar and they're usually not packed to the gills so it's great for grabbing some drinks and relaxing with friends.< /Text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

<Review>I was really hoping that I'd love this place. I have friends who used to come here all the time before it was closed. I wanted the reopening to be just as great as I had heard!
Unfortunately, I think this bar has taken on a little too much too quickly. The setting is beautiful, and feels like a 70s Bond film. The only caveat being that it is a little too bright,  it needs to be darker. The real problem was the drinks: expensive and weak. The bartender seemed in way over his head and very stressed. There were other people behind the bar, but no one was actually helping the poor bartender. The drink I had was tasty, but not at all worth what I paid for it.
The waitress we had was excellent and very helpful. However, the owner was constantly hovering around the room. It felt like she wanted people to move in and out quickly, which is not the atmosphere you should promote if you want people to come back.
This town is very lacking in a good bar scene. I had high hopes that this place might offer some salvation, but I was left disappointed. It is very new still, and I hope that it will improve with a little bit of experience, but it is lacking right now.<//Review>< pics>

Looking for a great place that has deep 60's 70's nostalgic feeling this is the place.  If you have a squeeze bring her here she wont leave unhappy.  Top shelf liquor to other premium drinks.  kudos to the owners for preserving some local history!</Text>< Date>

< Review>
THE WORST SERVICE EVER.  My girlfriend and I were there last night,  since she had not been in since the new ownership/remodel. We were lucky to score a seat at the bar (granted the place was packed) but we were never acknowledged, no eye contact, no greeting; NOTHING.  Basically we were invisible. A simple, "I will be right with you" or a nod or gesture goes a long way. Either employ your "hostess" to help with bartending (only two were behind the bar, and I assume they were the owners) or hire more staff. Given that this bar is one of the oldest and most known amongst locals in the Redding area, we were sorely disappointed.< /Review>

I LOVED Frank. The new Squire tries, but not very well. Overpriced and overly loud. Come in for one drink, then go to 1724 for conversation without screaming.<//Text>

<Review>This place is fly. Not a lot of places in Redding where you can get a really high quality cocktail with fun music, fab lighting and good people. The new owners really understand the history of this Redding landmark and are going to do amazing things. I've seen big city bars that don't have the bourbon selection this joint has. I live in LA but grew up in Redding and this is by far my favorite bar when I'm in town. Can't wait till they get the kitchen open! Treat yourself to a Manhattan with Angel's Envy Rye. Delicious!< /Review>< Resp>

<text>This place is amazing!! THIS WAS MY FIRST TIME AND I LOVED MY HAIR!! Please come to kenie she did an amazing job and my hair and also they're very clean, im scared on COVID and I noticed that they have a sanitation area and they clean the chairs after every costumer. Trust me I'm coming again. I thought no one could do my hair because I count find good hairstylists in Sacramento but she's good so definitely come!<//text>< pics>

<Review>I went here to start my dreadlocks I only have half of my hair due to the sides are faded I asked her how much it would be to start she told me $80 and coiled my hair and said that the next time I come back she would crochet them in which means the first time she knew that what she did was not going to work and I spent $80 for nothing went back to her two weeks later and she charge me $70 to crochet them in so she took my $80 knowingly that what she was did would not Take and would fall right out witch it did RIP OFF Rip OFF Rip OFF< /Review><Time>1614445690571< /Time>< rating>

Knowing the first method of locking your hair will take longer, but we changed for the crochet method in other to lock fast. But u still want to pay $50 for something the charge $150 and up. Now u ate giving me bag review for my kindness?.\nSo u think each time you come in for mentainance is free?\nPlease call around and see if they can charge $50 to crochet and braid your hair up."}</response>

<text>This place is absolutely AMAZING 😁😁😁 I came in looking like a puffy poodle after trying to do my own hair. I’ve been natural for 2 solid years now and haven’t put any heat to it, but now I’m expecting my first child and I wanted to have my hair straightened for the baby shower which was the very next day! 3/10/2018.  Literally I had no idea what to do so I looked for natural salons in the area on google (since I’m not from California and didn’t know what else to do).  I’m so thankful for these beautiful women! They got me layed and slayed honey, do you hear me!? 👏🏼😆 I was at a loss for words with the hair on my head, I just couldn’t believe it. It looks like i got a fresh perm but baby bye! If your hair is in need of some TLC look no further baby and head on over! Wait and I didn’t even mention the the prices! Girl it’s literally where you get your bang for your buck and I found the perfect earrings for my shower, since my colors are baby blue and gold. If I can figure out how to upload pictures I will!< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

At Kenie's Beauty Palace, I was put in a very hospitable environment where experience and professionalism was ensued on every client that walked through their doors. Kenie, the representative who worked on my hair, did an exceptional job fixing my locs and was very attentive towards my specific requests I wanted done to my hair. I HIGHLY recommend this establishment and I will definitively become a loyal client.</Review></record></dataset><record>

I've been a client of Kenie for 5 yrs and she's taken me from beginning dreads to the locs I love today. She is very talented and knowledgeable about hair care and is one of the kindest women I know. If you are looking for a positive experience, call Kenie. She does it all!<//Review>

Excellent service. The halibut was amazing. The sauce makes it more tastier and flavorful. Great combination with some guacamole and bacon with arugula on top. Good presentation and unique combination of ingredients. The avocado fries were okay. Two types of dipping sauces that I didnt think paired together. A garlic aioli would go better. Great view of the marina with the boats passing by. Quiet patio dining.<//Text>

Great Steak Wellington! Enjoyed the beautiful patio table overlooking the boats.
I also think it's great that they had a kid sized portion of Salmon so that kids can choose from something other than a burger vs. Mac & Cheese.< /Review>

Didn't refill any of our drinks. We shared dessert but they didn't have a common sense to bring more than 1 spoon. Didn't deserve the $85 mandatory tip. One and done, not coming back.< /Text><Date>1565472600325<//Date><pics>None<//pics><gmapID>0x80dcdffd4376bffd:0x57549e4a0d73a9fd< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<time>1558933901549< /time><rating>3<//rating><pictures>None<//pictures><text>If I could, I would have given it 3.5 stars just because it is a beautiful restaurant inside an even more beautiful hotel.  Gorgeous harbor view and the decore is nice, but very conservative (this is your grandparents restaurant).

Service was the best part of the night.  They were impeccable in their care, courteous, and very professional. Reminded me of Michelin starred French restaurants.

Unfortunately, food was very disappointing.  Dinner rolls looked grocery bought and cold (below room temperature).  Menu tries to be trendy, but it's about 5 years behind the times.  $35 to $60 for main course, but not very well prepared.  My white bass was thoughtlessly prepared without any flavor and my father's scallops were also very uninspired.  I wouldn't mind coming back to stay at the hotel, but I wouldn't come back here again.< /text>< GmapID>

Tl;dr: pricey but delicious. Very accommodating.

Great food choices. The Sunday brunch is expensive but worth it if you can eat a lot, great sore dishes, dessert.

Omelettes come with veggies. Pros: lobster omelette, crab cake Benedict. Nice view of the water, but cold in the winter/spring.< /text>

<Text>It was good but not excellent.  With the google rating of 4.7 my expectations were extremely high.  I’ve been to many 4.5+ restaurants around the US and this is more a 4.0.  So with ones expectations set there then its a beautiful setting on the harbor with a good wine list.   The menu had an exciting description of food but the final results were just a tad  bland. Our waiter was a little forgetful but par for a 4.0 restaurant.<//Text>< pictures>

<Text>Great place to have a special occasion. The atmosphere is laid back but elegant. The bartender and front of house staff were amazing - extremely accommodating, friendly, and professional. We tried about 6 different dishes and they were all prepared and seasoned very well. This place was a good find.

Parking inside the resort is free when you eat here. The restaurant is inside the resort near the ballrooms.

If you come in December, you can watch the Newport boat parade from your table at night.< /Text>< gmap_id>

<Text>So disappointed! I called in advance to set up my daughters after wedding dinner... I was assured the manager would call me back to assist me. Never received that call! Called more then once ahead of time to confirm the reservations and where I wanted to be seated and discussed the wedding cake being delivered ahead of time. The cake was delivered and the restaurant was asked to ensure it was NOT refrigerated. The cake company even asked to stay and watch over the cake and serve it and their request was denied. The cake was RUINED from being refrigerated! The service was absolutely horrible and though the food was good it was not excellent, nor was the menu what I had hoped for. Very disappointing- we spent a great deal of money here and will not be back!<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Great food with a pleasant atmosphere. The Bayside dining is by far the best view choice with heaters around to keep you cozy<//review>

<text>We did a company lunch event. If you love seafood, great menu. They had 3 non seafood items, visually the non seafood didn't compare to the others. The Kobe burger was good, cooked a perfect medium rare, but missed a flavor pop. Deserts were intriguing,  some never seen before, but they were delicious. The group had a good experience just give the non seafood people a higher end options.< /text>< pictures>

I had to give Waterline 1 star or could not write a review. We went to Easter brunch and basically had the worst food ever. The Dover Sole was basically a frozen fish stick. The value was very apparently a suffering restaurant. Dry bread was an appetizer option. The dessert we ordered was carrot cake which was three quarter size bites. Very embarrassing place to entertain. I grew up here in the O C. And used to be a member if the BBC. I will never recommend or go back. Almost u believeable!</text>

Came here for dinner one night for Newport Beach restaurant week and to try there's three course prefix menu. The food and the service were both impeccable. The food was definitely tasty, delicious, beautifully presented. Our server was super attentive and anticipated our knees in advance. We really loved him.< /text>

Their Sunday brunch is top rate with outstanding service. Clean plates and silverware were constantly supplied. Omelet station had everything you would want. Nice selection of salads, meats and cheese. I did not try their bread and pastry but they certainly looked very good. Great coffee along with an outstanding view of the bay from the second floor. Valet parking, too.<//Text>

<text>Four if us having lunch. Two of us vegetarian and the menu has only one option for us. Our server, Brian, suggested they could make a linguine with a variety of vegetables. We then asked for the house salad and could they add walnuts and avacado? The meal was amazing! Both our entree and the salad should be on the menu.</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

Food is so so, menu isn't that great. Hot chocolate tasted like warm milk, even after he made another one with double the chocolate. The Mahi tacos were actually good, but my stomach was bloated and hurting within an hour of leaving the restaurant. For the price, definitely not worth it to me. I have eaten here at Christmas time 4 years in a row, I order something different every time and I actually think Urban Plates has better food< /text>

This place is an amazing place to go to after playing golf right next to the restaurant, it has alot of great food but people I know system that it has some good salmon. I personally say that the salads look beautiful and the crispy fish and chips are on!< /review>

Came here and wasn't very impressed with how fresh the food was the fish look like it was out of the bag very watery not fresh at all. The steak was super small and dry the only good thing was the shrimp.<//Review>

< Review>
Had a great birthday celebration with my sister and fiancé. Live pianist and cellist on a Saturday night, dressy but relaxed atmosphere. Service was professional and present without being obtrusive. We started with fresh, made-to-order focaccia for the table and cocktails. All cocktails were delicious and I loved the pineapple-mezcal cocktail. The scallops were cooked perfectly. Thank you, Waterline restaurant for an unforgettable dining experience! It was everything I wanted for my birthday dinner!</Review>

For someone who has been to many saloons in the area and struggled to find a quality haircut in Bay Area for years, this place definitely live up to their name and I wish I found this place sooner. Ann is easily the best hair stylist i worked with last 10 years. She really listens and very detailed focused and don't rush the hair cut or comprise the quality. And top of that she is very friendly and pleasant to talk to and time always seems to fly by quickly. Now that I have moved out of state, I will sure miss this place. Thanks Ann for all the great hair cuts :)< /Review>

Personally I'd highly recommend getting a men's hair-cut with Dorris. She's patient and takes a step back to completely understand your expectations and communicates efficiently during the cut as well. Also, it's remarkable that they only accept appointments which greatly reduces the wait-time [actually 0]. From a price stand-point, the men's hair-cuts are fairly economical [~35]</text></record>

I found this salon, when I moved to Mountain View 3 years ago. I have been living in this area for 15 years and tried many fancy overpriced haircut places as well as all the supercuts of the kind. Coming from Europe it was so hard to find a place that knows how to style your hair and take care of you. They are not only professionals in haircuts, but are prompt, confirm appointments and care for their customers.

I only go to Quality Men's haircuts they are the best; any stylist is great! If you are searching for a place for a haircut, look no further and give it a try!</Text>

<review>Very good and friendly service. Conveniently located if you work around Mountain View. They have offers for new customers (as of October 2019), so a good option if you are new to the area.
Parking is limited, but you have other parking options on the main road.
Accepts credit card.</review>< pics>

Doris was awesome. Booking online was easy. Details of services are clearly outlined. As a guy with gently curled hair that only behaves when cut well and to the right length I've had a hard time finding a barber that's willing to leave enough length for the curls to do their thing. Doris got it right immediately despite my inept attempts at explaining what I wanted. She understood what I wanted, was friendly and made it easy. I'm thrilled :) I'd definitely go back and plan on doing so.</Text>

<review>Worst haircut of my life followed up by an even worse beard trim. My was about 1.5 inches.....it now all has to come off because of the horrible work. My cheek line on one side touches my jaw line! Thats right,  on only one side. Barber continued to trim after I asked her to stop. She complained the whole time she cut my hair. I hope to get a refund as I have to now go pay for someone else to fix it.<//review><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x808fb72853e38d49:0xf0a276d05359f582<//gmapID><user>103236903748374947360</user>< Time>

<review>I've been having hit and miss cuts here. The last two times here my hair was done pretty badly, based on this my wife asked me to please find a new place.

Depending on who's available your hair may be done anywhere from really good to really bad (baldspots, bad and uneven cut).</review>< Resp>

This is by far the best Men's Hair Salon I ever been. Very friendly staff and listening to my wishes but also very creative in suggesting new hair styles. My appointments have been always punctual and I was always very satisfied with the hair cuts. The salon is very clean and has a very friendly ambient with a charming owner. I tried several Hair Salons in the Bay Area and this is the best one I found and can strongly recommend it.</text>

Doris has been cutting my husband's hair for years, since even before she opened this salon. She is professional and gives a precision cut. It is pricey for a men's cut, but worth it for the extra perks like paraffin for the hands and steamed face cloth treatments. For him, I think it's like going to the spa without going to the spa. Would definitely recommend.<//review>

<Review>I've been extremely pleased with the service and haircuts I get from Doris.  She's very skilled, quite sweet, and definitely meticulous in her work.

Do pay the few extra bucks for the deluxe service, which includes a scalp massage, an extra shampoo, warm scented towels on your face, and (I feel so unmanly recommending this) a paraffin wax treatment for your hands.

And tell Doris you found her via Google; she'll be especially delighted :-).< /Review>< Pictures>

Great haircut. The woman who cut my hair did a great job. I especially like the fact that after the haircut is when you get a shampoo. (I never understood why every other place does it before, I have to go home and wash all the little hairs out afterwards anyways.)<//text>

<Review>A decent haircut (35+tip) but an incredibly negative experience with Ann. I was told to sit down by one of the people who worked there and then Ann got (very vocally) pissed off at me and her for me sitting down ahead of one of her clients. I don't believe that that would have warranted 1 star by itself,  but throughout the 30 minutes that I was there she just talked trash about me as if I wasn't there to her client (more than likely a regular). Needless to say, I'm not coming back.< /Review>< Pics>

<review>One of my worst hair cut experiencies so far. Quite short-spoken and unsmiling. Very harsh treatment of the head with the shaver like it was a ball. The shaver cable was in my face several times and the hair got way shorter than discussed. Only a second star because it was quite cheap with the "first time" discount (which I booked online but only got upon request then...)< /review><date>1511944201490</date><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><username>Benjamin Raethlein</username><rating>2<//rating></record></dataset><record>

Best pizza around. Got the Papa's all meat without sausage. The only pizza that is guaranteed good every time you get it. Never have any complaints with them. Sauce is good has a nice flavor all the toppings are great. Highly recommend if you don't mind taking it home to cook it. You won't be disappointed. On Tuesdays any large pizza is just 10 bucks!</Text>

Worth the two hour drive to get here as this is the closest location to us now unfortunately. The s'mores bars are fantastic and love the pizza options. Placed the order online and got free cookie dough. Our order was ready faster than anticipated which was cool.< /review>

Love their pizza- especially the tai chicken. Fast service. They take EBT. My only complant it that they used to have more coupons and specials- I feel like it's a bit expensive at full price.</review>

They're great on Tuesday on $10 pizza Tuesday, but they don't accept online coupons and they're no cheaper than a baked pizza and the same price not on Tuesday. Their ingredients are top notch tho, so ultimately it is a better pizza. But during the summer who wants to turn an oven to 425 for 20 minutes and heat up the house more?</Text>

Three stars because at least the pizza is good. However the attitude the cashier had was unacceptable. As soon as I walked through the door she had an unfriendly look on her face. I was very uncomfortable and even witnessed her being rude to another customer. Her tone and face is very inappropriate. Won't be coming back anytime soon.<//Text>

My wife and I consistently order from this site, and we've been getting Papa Murphy's for years from other sites as well.

This site has an excellent track record with the quality of their pizzas. As with all of them that you take and bake yourself, you need to watch out for bubbles and pop them before they become a problem. There has never been an issue with mislabeled items we've picked up and the flavor of the food items we get always indicates that their ingredients are fresh and well rotated.

I've been to some that have well-crafted interior designs that give a welcoming feel to customers, but this is not one of those. It's a functional stainless-steel facade that gets your attention, and the ceiling and walls are not bright or color-appropriate for the setting. This leads to an uncomfortable impression on those who walk in.

The people working behind the counter are businesslike and professional but a little quiet and not as forward as in other stores, or even other stores of the same franchise. I imagine the interior design has this effect on them as well. Regardless, every experience speaking with them has been positive.

I've never seen someone upset with the fact that this unique business model which gives you the opportunity to get cheap pizzas of high quality and bake them yourself in your oven at home so they are as fresh as physically possible, rate it a 2 until now. Seriously, anybody who has a problem with that needs to critically reevaluate their boons in life and be thankful for what they have. To counteract their ignorance I'm rating it a 5.< /review>

Great pizza freshly made, just take it home and cook when ready, good selection of toppings and remember to pick up a tag for your keys that's an extra dollar off every time you collect a pizza.<//Review>

In my opinion the best pizza around, I always get the stuffed. Not sure if they have gone through management changes recently, but lately they seem to be skimping on the pizzas. They use to put all the meats and veggies on top of the stuffed pizza as well as the inside. Now they just put cheese on top. Guess I'll have to start specifying exactly what i want.< /review>

Host were acting like 🐒's. Pizza took 30mins to make. Then they forgot to add certain toppings to a pizza. Was hoping for a better experience. 😫😓😢< /Review>

The series of buildings at the Queen Anne Cottage and Coach Barn in Arcadia are currently listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

These beautifully-restored Victorian-era structures were built in the mid to late-1800’s, and you can explore them and the surrounding property on your own or with a guided tour.<//text>

Simply breathtaking. A discovery as you wander around these gardens. It is as you imagined it should be from 1900. I almost looked for the horse and carriage that would take me back in time.<//Review>

<Text>It has very Beautiful and Amazing views of the nature surrounding it. The Queen 👑  Anne Cottage is Extrordinary I like the Architecture the Architect put into that Cottage. I Loved 💘 all the Beautiful views it had throughout the whole place I really enjoy being around places that are surrounded by nature. I went here with my family a few times. One of those times it was during Christmas when they have the lights all throughout the entire place. Those lights were very amusing and amazing.</Text>< response>

<Review>It was a very beautiful Cottage the only bad thing about it is that the public is not allowed to go inside the Cottage but you can still look through the windows everything inside is beautiful and very well kept. There is some chairs to seat outside and take beautiful pictures< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None< /response><user_id>107865353308846543833< /user_id><Time>1553829231500</Time>< name>

<Review>I can definitely say I had a great time here the house its self is gorgeous even if the stuff inside is a bit creepy I can understand that it is a historical place with stories inside but I also really like how you can have a seat overlooking the lake as well so if you need a quick minute to just chill out is say this would be a cool spot to come over and check out you will like it< /Review>< Response>

< Review>
The cottage is one of many sites within the LA Arboretum. It is an expansive park full of beautiful plants, a large pond, and several historical sites. This is worth the visit --either to stroll the grounds, picnic on the lawns, or get tea while looking at the peacocks.< /Review>

I mean hell, on top of that let’s not even light the inside of the house so you cant look in from the windows. Also have some type of muddy water in front of house, pretending to be a lake?< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<rating>5</rating><username>Rose Campiran</username><review>"Da plane, da plane!" Fantasy Island was filmed here.  That phrase was yelled from its red and white gingerbread style tower.  Murder She Wrote turned it into any number of exotic locations. See photos at kiosk out front of entrance. No, Queen Anne's Cottage is only open during special events and requires no photos taken inside n all wear protective booties. It is sorth the tour then. Catch old episodes of MSR on youtube n see the inside of the Cottage and upstairs too. Come early morning n follow the green painted path on the walkway, bring snacks, water, a bird book and binoculars n sit on porch of cottage to view herons, egrets, kingfisher, listen for the loud deep bullfrog along the lake. Look into the lit interior and gaze on a game of old time cards, chess and musical instruments. Then grab lunch at Peacock Cafe and return with coffee n a good book on front porch and catch hawks or yellow orioles flittering along the sage or palm tree tops. Enjoy!!!<//review>< date>

< Review>
DO NOT COME HERE
I had brought my dads truck here to get a smog, it didn’t past and I was charged almost $90 because the owner insisted it required a star smog and was PROMISED a second retest for FREE and when my dad tried to go back the owner said it had already been too long and his “promise” had expired. He told my dad if it was within 2 weeks it would’ve been free. There is NO fine print on the failed smog he gave me and he never mentioned a time limit. Sketchy scamming businesses like this deserve no ones hard earned money, I will be making sure none of my friends or family ever come here again. On top of this the owner was being a creep , do not go here if you are a women either!!</Review>

Paid for smog check, attendant REALLY wanted me to pay for my tags there. PEOPLE BEWARE, tried to overcharge me for the entire thing. Upgraded to star when I didn't need it. I had already checked the DMV website before going. Asked me to bring the money for tags even if I had to come back later just to pay there. PLEASE just pay your tags online and you can avoid places like this trying to overcharge you for something that you can do on your own on the DMV website. You can do it from your phone. I read the reviews and thought this place would be trustworthy, but not after my experience.< /Review>

Recently bought a used car and needed smog, title change and registration done on a Saturday due to repairs taking up the week and hitting the 10 day limit. Danny was courteous and up front about costs, everything was done quickly and I saved a ton of time versus going to the DMV. Would definitely recommend him to others.< /review>

This place was fantastic! Took 20 minutes to get a smog, pay for it and pay my registration. Saved me tons of time not having to go to the DMV. He even put my sticker on for me. The guys here do not make you feel stupid for not knowing anything about your car. Very polite, friendly and accommodating. Definitely going to refer friends and come back when its time again.<//text>

Needed a small fix done on my car. The door handle came off when I had my windshield replaced, but didn't notice until later because it was my rear passenger door. After the glass guy ghosted me I hit up Emerson at Mr Smog and Registration Services. He is the man. A repair like this would usually be at least a hundred bucks considering it's an older BMW and he did it for free. Only took him a few minutes, but was an awesome gesture. Definitely won my future business!< /Review>

For the first time, I found a mechanic who is honest and can be trusted with my VW GTI.  Emerson was on time, he kept me posted with (texts) through the day, and photo's of the parts.  Location is also fantastic right off the freeway.  I said I would even come back for my oil changes, since Jiffy Lube ruined my plug.<//review>

I highly recommend this place. If you live anywhere near Mary Immaculate Catholic Church, and you need a smog check, YOU HAVE TO COME HERE. The price is VERY affordable, they have water or soda for you to drink while you wait, and you are in-and-out very quickly. In addition....you can do DMV registration services here as well; no need to spend half a day waiting in line. I will definitely be back the next time I need a smog and I will send anyone else that I know here as well. Danny is SUPER helpful and patient and wants you to pass the smog. He will help you in any way that he can.

P.S. They have a great stack of magazines to read while you wait.<//text>

Very fast,courteous, informative service. Found this place on google decided to try them out. I Called mr Smog up to make an appointment, Danny (Mr. Smog) Answered, he was polite and friendly. I went in filled out the paperwork and Mr. Smog was kind enough to walk me through the whole process (my first time doing the smog test). It took no more than 20 minutes before I was out the door with my new tags in hand!

Thanks again for great service, and I will be back next year :D</text>

Called and asked for prices on smog plus registration. When I arrived they said 39 for smog and we continued the transaction. After snog was finished they said it's actually 50! Was also told registration would be 50 they wanted to charge 75 when I got there for that as well. It's ridiculous. All they are is liars and con artists.< /Text>

Not only was I able to find Mr Smog very easily, I didn't have to wait forever either. I was trying to get my car smogged by this other guy, but he kept giving me the run-around.  I actually went to the other guy first and he told me to come back in 30 mins, so I decided to check out other smog places close by and that's how I met Danny. I don't know how a smog check could get any easier.  After my car passed I was able to get my stickers right then and there, no need to go to the DMV! I hope that everyone who wants a great smog experience goes to Mr Smog, anything else is such a waste of time and money.</review>

<Review>Other than feeling glad my car passed smog, I'm glad that I found this location for a smog check. This is my 2nd time, 2nd car and have received great customer service and informative knowledge from, Danny "Mr. Smog", on what steps I need to take to get through the smog & car registration process. Danny is also easy to deal with (not a strict or robot persona) or talk with on any topic and will definitely make your smog-ging experience easy to deal with.<//Review><rate>5<//rate>< Time>

Solar is a great investment for the home especially if you're able to take advantage of the tax benefits. This company did a good job on my home as going solar was easy with them. The process was quick after they looked over my bills. Quoted us a great price and got things going right after. Great company to work with, and highly recommend their solar service</Review>

I have definitely seen a major difference in my family and electrical bill now that we have solar. We were very conscious before about the ac unit running during the summers and made sure to always plug our electric vehicles when the tiers were at a cheaper rate. Southwest Solar gave us a nice breakdown of how much we would save in the long run if we decided to go solar this year. We are able to take advantage of the tax benefits and the job was done nicely with no issues or problems. Great solar company as me and my family had a wonderful experience with this company. They took care of everything and did an amazing job on my home.</text>

<Text>With everything going on this year we had decided to take the time and find a solar company to help us with our installation. We are very familiar with solar as we had it installed in our old home before selling it recently. Southwest solar was one of the high rated companies in our area. We ended up using them to work on our house and they did a good job. This company did a nice job and took care of us properly as customer service was excellent!</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x80c296901f34c333:0xb2aab49e1ddb0a2f< /GmapID></record>

After doing my research and spending a great amount of time looking for a good affordable solar company we hired this company. SW was very attentive when we had follow up questions about the installation and price wise they were also the best. Working with them after signing all the paper work was easy they took care of everything very quickly! Our solar system has been up and running for a few months now . I would recommend anyone whos looking into solar should get a quote from this company as well as they were excellent to work with on my end.</review>

Having this company install solar on our home was great as they took care of inspectionsand everything passed the first time as we received a text to keep us updatedon how the job was going. Southwest Solar did a good and quick job as the panels were installedall in one day and we waited for the final inspection to be set within the week due to some delays from the city coming out. Overall great solar experience.<//Review>

<review>I project manager here is great! We had them work on our tile roof which we were very worried about the tile breaking but they had a lot of experience. Roof was great as they did replace a few broken tiles and pictures were also provided. I went up to check the work after on the roof and everything looked really nice. Great solar company and they did a good job on my home.< /review>< pics>

Southwest solar helped me and my family go solar during the pandemic. Obviously we understood there would be some delays as everyone was short staff. Even though my project was on hold and had delays I was very pleased with the weekly updates SW would provide for me, just to let me know my project was a priority for them. Very happy as the job is now done and we are so are pleased with this company.< /Text>

Southwest Solar helped me with my solar system and installed 23 panels to my home. Everything was done very nicely and I'm very happy with my experience with them. They were on top of all deliveries and inspections. Highly recommended and five of five job well done by SW.< /text>

I needed to get a new solar system as we moved, and I really liked the benefits of solar especially with the tax credits.
We used south west solar to help us install our new system as I was already familiar with the whole process from my old
solar system. They had newer upgraded panels then the ones I had before and they did a nice job!< /text>

I had solar installed by Southwest Solar and it is the best decision I have ever made! They were helpful in putting my mind at ease about energy conservation. Excellent customer service from start to finish. Whenever I had a questions, they were quick to respond and educate on the benefits of going solar. The installation process was smooth and the channels of communication were always open. Even after the job was completed they came out to make sure the panes were working efficiently. They actually care about their customers.<//Review>

I was recommended by a friend for Southwest Solar and I wasn’t disappointed! The person I spoke with was very helpful and informative and gave me confidence that I was investing in the right place and product. He even went out of his way to compare local prices to assure I was getting the best quote. Can’t say enough about the great customer service! Definitely recommend!< /text>

I just realize everyone is buying and using solar these days. I finally tried it out and wish I started the day it came out. I save so much money every month now. I’m very happy now that I save money for other uses. These guys gave me a nice quote and have good quality panels.< /Text>

What a wonderful team to work with. I started off just by calling to get more information about solar but they offered to have a free consult with my wife and I and they took the time to explain everything, provided us a quote based on our wattage and how many panels we would need. They were not overly pushy and tried to get us to do anything. After my wife and I reevaluated our finances we decided to do it with them and it went well.<//Text>

Such a great company! Very customer service oriented. Sounds like they are getting busy because the date to start my installs was a bit longer then I expected but they explained to me its because there has a been numerous people getting installs with them which I understand. So book soon if you guys! Other than that everything seems to be in order and I'll get calls from there to assure that I haven't been forgotten which is great.<//review>

After checking a few other companies, we found Southwest Solar. Our sales rep was fantastic from the beginning to end. Once my wife and I made our decision and paid our deposit things moved rapidly. Our project manager was efficient and our solar panels were installed ahead of schedule. Their crew had our solar panels installed in two days. Fantastic company to work with and they were always there when we had any questions.< /review>

Been looking into Solar installs for awhile and saw on Yelp that Southwest was having a promo $200 for $500 Deal. Pretty much you get a voucher redeemable for $500 at Southwest Solar. Sweet! Convinced me it was the time to get it done. Spoke with Donna and Amber about the run down on the installs and within a week my house has gone Solar. Easy as that.</review>

Finally decided to get the solar panels after an entire 2 years of checking and reviewing if it was in my budget. At first I was not to certain if it was going to be worth the amount of money I paid since I bought the panels for the new home but its an investment if you are going to stay long term in your home. The guys were professional and good at explaining the entire process. If youre looking for someone with a fair price and good service they are definitely it.<//Review>

I am very glad I chose to go with this company. The customer service was great and they were very friendly. They offered very good prices for the panels and installation. I am extremely happy with my solar and strongly recommend you to choose this company to get Solar. I have referred all of my friends, and the ones who went solar are all happy with it too.</review>

I was looking into getting solar for my house and researched a few other companies before contacting Southwest Solar. They were able to send out a representative right away. The rep was really helpful and knowledgeable. After comparing prices I decided to go with Southwest Solar, as their pricing was super competitive and they were able to start on my job right away. I was very happy with the whole process and would recommend anyone looking into solar to give them a call.</Text>

I am very happy with the services from southwest. At first I did not want to gt solar as it was something that was not in my familys immediately budget and I did not like how it would look on my roof, however, after talking to some friends and seeing them get it I reconsidered and called southwest who my buddy used. The price was fair where my family and I could afford it and the benefits seemed great. It was a very smooth process overall and we got it done in time for the summer.</text>

My wife and I just turned on our solar system last week and are so pleased with our panels and installation from Southwest Solar. They were professional and efficient. We went from making a phone call to learn about their company to a quote and install in less than 5 weeks.  They didn't try to oversell us and created a system that fit our power needs and most importantly our budget. Highly recommend.<//text>

<Review>Thanks to a close friends referral I happily gone with Southwest Solar. Originally had a lot of mixed opinions about getting solar panels for home. I was told it wouldn't be worth it, I might be ending up spending more, etc. I'm so glad people at Southwest solar explained everything thoroughly and they're very informative and knowledgeable. From the consultation to the installation, everything went with ease. If anyone else is skeptical about getting solar, and don't be shy about calling them!<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

Price, quality, and most of all the customer service that was provided to be was unbeatable. I have worked with alot of various companies in the past for either my roof, simple handyman work etc and its hard to find a good price and great quality. Thanks to southwest solar I can definitely leave my lights on and blasting the AC in this Cali 100 degree weather.< /text>

WHEN MY HUSBAND AND I PURCHASED OUR NEW HOME WE WANTED TO GET SOLAR INSTALLED AS OUR MAIN PRIORITY. THE HOUSE WE WERE PREVIOUSLY RENTING HAD SOLAR INSTALLED AND IT HELPED US SAVE ON UTILITIES RIGHT AWAY. I CALLED MY OLD LANDLORD AND HE RECOMMENDED SOUTHWEST AS THAT IS WHO HE WENT WITH. THE INSTALLATION WAS GREAT AND THE WORK LOOKS AMAZING WE COULDN'T BE MORE ECSTATIC ABOUT THE JOB!</Text>

Called up a few places before going solar. SW shared a lot off good references upon request. They did a good job and we are happy with our 6.2 kw system. Everything is great we have a monitoring system as well to make sure its up and running properly we can check from our phone how cool is that.< /Text>

<text>Southwest Solar did a great job at installing my panels. I was in talks with them and few other companies, but why I ultimately chose them was because of their competitive pricing. They were very clear on the taxes and rebates that I would get back, and the install finished 1 day before estimated. Thanks for the hardworking crew for the hard work!< /text>< Pictures>

Found this company on google and then also took a look at them on yelp . I’m looking into possibly getting solar now and wanted to get some more information . I want a local solar company and I had them go over my electrical bills . I wanted to know the difference between lease and purchase . Being able to claim a tax credit was something that drew my attention. Thanks southwest for sharing solar details and if I decide to move forward I will give you guys a call .< /Text>

Detail was key to southwest solar getting me as a customer. I take time in selecting the correct companies to do any work on my home. The quality of the panels and inverters they had were top of the line. and the reviews and certificates showed they were most qualified.</Text>

We recently had our solar system installed by Southwest Solar and I have to say the entire process went as well as I could have imagined. The Sales Team/energy consultants answered all of my questions during the initial phone call and meeting. They were extremely knowledgeable and experienced than other solar companies I met with. They broke down the tax benefits and the rest were easy decisions. Within a day and a half, my 5.8kW system was installed, but it did take a few days to turn the system on because of delay from my utility company. I heard this is normal for there to be slight delays. All in all, I would recommend Southwest Solar to anyone thinking about going solar.</review>

Feeling hesitant about going Solar? Speak with anyone that works at Southwest Solar and you will be convinced that it’s the right place to go. Can’t get over how nice and informative the service reps were I believe Robert and Jacob was the ones I spoke with and I never felt any forcefulness from any of them. Mostly importantly they did a great job with our installs!< /Review>

<review>Also one of the companies I got an estimate for solar with. Asher was my first encounter and he was great. He really knew his stuff from the installation of the solar panels to explaining and answering all my questions. Price was they were just as competitive as everyone else. It's definitely really tough and I feel like I'm purchasing a car when it comes to solar. Im glad they came out to go over what they can do for me and highly recommend giving this company a call if your looking into getting solar.< /review>< Pics>

I am in the process of remodeling my home and decided to look into solar. As a first time buyer I had so many questions regarding the process, cost, investment, rebates incentives, etc. Southwest Solar's team was extremely helpful and patient with me when answering any of my questions. They are not only professional but also very knowledgeable. I highly recommend Southwest Solar for all of your solar needs!<//text>

<Text>Been looking into Solar installs for awhile and saw on Yelp that Southwest was having a promo $200 for $500 Deal. Pretty much you get a voucher redeemable for $500 at Southwest Solar. Sweet! Convinced me it was the time to get it done. Spoke with Donna and Amber about the run down on the installs and within a week my house has gone Solar. Easy as that.< /Text></record>

Working in real estate it is important to help my clients increase the value on their homes. I like recommend vendors that can help increase the value of their homes in efficient and cost effective ways. When it comes to solar energy I always refer my clients to Southwest Solar and I have always received excellent feedback.Their team is thorough, knowledgeable and they really want their clients to be happy with their purchase. The systems  are excellent and installed by professional, skilled workers who take pride in their work.<//text>

My Southwest Solar rep, was very helpful during the decision process at no point did I feel pressured into anything. He took the time to explain the benefits of solar and checked on my electricity usage to see if it would be a good fit .If you want the best bang for the buck, A system that is installed quickly, safely and professionally, you will likely not find a better company to do the job. I stand firmly behind Southwest solar.</review>

I found them through a Yelp advertisement a few months ago and gave them a call. They were very professional and gave a lot of useful tips and advice on the rebates I would receive, even if I chose not to go with them. I sat on the information for a few weeks and decided to move forward with them. They do great work and will be working on another rental property of mine within the next few weeks.

Solar panels are the way to go. Both my brother and sister in law got it done with southwest solar and when I came over they shared the details, pricing and experiences with me and they were correct. southwest solar offered me a better price as i did not need as many panels as they dud but the process was the same and seamless to the t. Everything went great from the start to the end of the installation. I opted to get one that was a little pricer panel as i wanted to ensure that it would be the best ones.< /text>

Mostly importantly they did a great job with our installs!</Text><UserId.>110440442048878419125< /UserId.>< rate>

<Review>My wife and I hired Southwest Solar to install our panels just before the holidays. We were actually thinking about going with a competitor, but ultimately decided to work with these guys. Danny is super awesome and very friendly. They have an overall friendly vibe and I've already referred these guys to my aunt and uncle for a 2019 Solar project. Great professionals.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

I was shocked on the price they gave me for solar panels. When I found out they gave a great deal I had to get what’s best for my house. I got them and the guys installed it very good. Very good quality panels.< /text>

Been a great experience working with Tom and southwest solar. They were upfront about the expectations of cost, payment, materials, and labor and especially the city process for doing solar. I appreciated their expertise and knowledge and that is why I decided to go with them</review>

I was referred to southwest solar by a relative who had gotten their solar done by the company. Their prices were competitive but their customer service is what really made me decide to go with them. They were really knowledgeable and answered all my questions and concerns. The installation of the panels only took a couple a couple of days and soon I was up and running. I really recommend that anyone looking into getting solar check this company out.</Text>

Was not to sure about solar until I saw one of my neighbors getting it installed and how affordable it was. He said his bill was $0 and there was  no way I believed him until I got my quote. They did a great job in explaining it to my mom and I the cost benefit analysis, how it will pay itself overtime and mainly that they would take care of everything for us. They even did a through inspection of my room made sure a few things were patched up and ready to go prior to installing the panels. I cannot say enough about the great customer service, they were able to work with my schedule and did a wonderful job with everything< /Review>

In the past few years my electricity bill has been through the roof and looked into solar.  I shopped around the various companies in LA and came across southwest solar.  These guys are amazing and the prices were very affordable.  They walked us through the whole process and they were very informative from beginning to end.  I even scheduled them to see my parents home to help them save money as well.</review>

Our Solar guide is what I like to call it named David was such a fantastic help. He helped my neighbours with their Solar installs so I knew he was the one to go to for help. He walked us through the process because myself and husband had no idea about Solar besides it saving money on electricity. It took about a week to get done and so far its been working great. I trust that I will have no issues with my solar.<//Review>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>Also one of the companies I got an estimate for solar with. Asher was my first encounter and he was great. He really knew his stuff from the installation of the solar panels to explaining and answering all my questions. Price was they were just as competitive as everyone else. It's definitely really tough and I feel like I'm purchasing a car when it comes to solar. Im glad they came out to go over what they can do for me and highly recommend giving this company a call if your looking into getting solar.< /Text>< Pictures>

Great company and crew. I contacted Southwest Solar for solar installation after a friend recommendation. They came to my house for their on site assessment and in less than a day they come back with the layout plan. Received the final inspection from the city and all systems are a go! Just in time for the Summer.< /Text>

Blessed to have found a great company that is honest and provided a great service for our panels. They helped us get a panel upgrade install our solar system with no issues. System was up a running after sign off and clearance in 2 weeks. That was great!! Sales rep Asher was awesome to work with and we will refer this company to our family and friends.< /text>

Dependable solar company. It's really tough to find a company that can honestly do what they say. After seeing my next door neighbors experience I felt comfortable to move forward with SW. They did an amazing job and gave a great price on the complete job.< /review>

Decided to go solar this year and I was glad I did. I was unsure if this was a cost effective investment but the amount of electricity I am using it only makes sense. I looked into a few companies and decided that the most cost efficient company was southwest solar. They were able to match competitor pricing and also get the job done in a short amount of time. I was worried about hidden cost but they were upfront about everything from the beginning. I am glad I decided to get solar, will definitely be using my central AC this summer.<//text>

when looking for solar, getting info from just one company is never enough. I had previously looked into 3 companies before deciding to go with southwest solar and i can honestly say I'm glad i choose the correct company. the installers were great and got right to work the first day here, they had the whole work area clean and dandy and i couldnt be more pleased with the work!</Text>

My family was very pleased with Southwest Solar's work on this project. Their crew showed up on time and explained the work that they were doing, and were helpful and patient with my family's  basic electrical questions. The owner handled the installation design and was very responsive to my questions and suggestions about improvements to the design. The solar panels installation looks clean and tidy and fits in with our house. I've already recommended them to my friends and family!< /Text>

Southwest Solar did an awesome job on my home install. Although, it was finished a day later then expected I understood the reasoning behind it. They wanted to take the extra time to assure everything was installed and working perfectly. I appreciated the extra effort they did to check to assure I was happy with the install.< /Review>

After hearing using Solar I can eliminate my electricity bill to $0 was something I had to look into. Edsel was the person I spoke with to help me out with all my Solar questions. What I really liked is that I wasn’t rushed into buying anything and cost wasn’t brought up until I brought it up. I was given the run down on Solar and what was best for me and benefits. After a long talk I’m convinced everyone should go Solar lol. Great service!<//Text>

Good to know I was able to work with people who have integrity and stand by their work. They made sure all my questions were properly answered and that I understood everything before signing and thats rare these days. The work was stupendous and the guys had a great work ethic.

They were able to compare apples to apples get me exactly what I wanted for the price I wanted as well . Easy company to work with job was done right .< /text>

Going Solar with Southwest was the best idea. They did a good job with the installation and we are very happy . There are a lot of solar companies but for me its best with southwest. Highly credible company , they are hard to find but this is a really good company.<//text>

I really like Shiran, he was the sales rep that came out to my home to give us an estimate of solar. This company was one of 3 companies i chose to interview. I thought very highly of them when they came and gave us a consultation on time and also spent a good amount of time at my house. They had some great solar projects they shared that they finished and I thought very highly of this company. Wish them nothing but continued success based on my experience.<//text>

Trust the reviews. Southwest goes beyond when it comes to customer satisfaction. Some places just make the sale and you never hear from them again but Southwest follows up with you and every little detail during the install process. I recommend Southwest to anybody that is thinking about going Solar</Text>

<review>Southwest Solar's sales team was incredibly patient in answering all my questions before sending someone out for an estimate to our house. When I spoke to the sales guy, he went through answering my questions with visuals that made it easy to understand. I enjoyed the fact that there was no added pressure but instead added information that made me that much more assured of my choice to go solar. The installation was very smooth and short of the time it took for the utility to respond my experience was top notch. My system has been running well since I have had it on and have referred some of my cousins who were thinking of moving to solar.<//review><gmapID>0x80c296901f34c333:0xb2aab49e1ddb0a2f<//gmapID><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< username>

Gave them a call for an estimate and they were very friendly and welcoming. No pressure on buying so our job was on hold for 2 weeks and then finally gave them a call. They finished the job within days and the install was perfect. Thank you SW solar!</Text>

Southwest Solar was amazing for our house in Burbank.  They were so good at figuring out exactly what we needed; our energy bill has been reduced a lot per month since the installation and couldn't be happier and better yet helping the environment.  I shopped around for the best quotes for months and was glad I went with them, they were very courtesy and all the employees from phone calls to installation knew what they are talking about.< /review>

South west was one of 2 companies we called for a solar and roof estimate, they came out and was very knowledgable about solar and how the complete job would be done. They spent a good amount at my house on the first visit and we set up a second appointment to finalize all the questions we had left and gave them the opportunity to work on out home. It turned out great!< /Text>

Southwest Solar met all my expectations for solar!  They were very pleasant and courtesy over the phone and during the installation.  I already see the savings on my electricity bill and got it done right before the summer heat.  There are a lot of solar companies in LA, and no one could beat their places!.</text>

Looked at a lot of other quotes for solar, and this company was the one that stood out. The price was fair, but I liked them because they say with me and showed me different options on payments. Since it's a big commitment I really needed to know what I was getting myself into, and Southwest helped me.</Text>

I called Southwest Solar for solar installation and they were able to come onsite to explain the details and also gave me advice on the best panels that would fit my house. I had several quotes with different solar companies but Southwest Solar offered me the best deal and service. The whole process was extremely smooth and I was able to get a final inspection with the city and now my solar is up running. Thank you Southwest Solar!<//review>

Outside of hearing about Solar energy, I had no idea how the process worked. I called and spoke with David from Southwest Solar and he broke down everything for me from the life expectancy to the pricing and benefits of having a solar panel system. Needless to say, I’m now in the process of having it installed and still a bit nervous about my invest but the occasional check ups from David is very reassuring. Great service! Thank you David!<//Review>

<Review>southwest solar is a excellent company. i previously got panels installed by another company and it was one of the worst experiences i had. it made be very cautious with the other companies but southwest changed my mind. i had personal customer care by the owner himself which made the process way better thank you southwest!<//Review><Date>1545961027892< /Date>< user>

I was honest to let him know I was getting 2 more estimates for solar and there was no push or hard sell like some other companies who only offer there price for one day when I tell them im getting other estimates.

We recently had our solar system installed by Southwest Solar and I have to say the entire process went as well as I could have imagined. The Sales Team/energy consultants answered all of my questions during the initial phone call and meeting. They were extremely knowledgeable and experienced than other solar companies I met with. They broke down the tax benefits and the rest were easy decisions. Within a day and a half, my 5.8kW system was installed, but it did take a few days to turn the system on because of delay from my utility company. I heard this is normal for there to be slight delays. All in all, I would recommend Southwest Solar to anyone thinking about going solar.< /Text>

Going solar was tough for us in the beginning as we didn't know much. We wanted to help the environment and save money as well because this was an investment in our home and we really saw savings within the next months.</Review>

I looked up the top 3 companies for solar in my area set up an appointment and south west was the one company that I felt relly comfortable hiring to do the installation was they were the most knowledgable compared to the other 2 companies. THey spent the most time and cared about the process and finish. SOLAR is the way to go and southwest is the company to di it with.< /text>

Solar is a great investment for the home especially if you're able to take advantage of the tax benefits. This company did a good job on my home as going solar was easy with them. The process was quick after they looked over my bills. Quoted us a great price and got things going right after. Great company to work with, and highly recommend their solar service< /review>

I have definitely seen a major difference in my family and electrical bill now that we have solar. We were very conscious before about the ac unit running during the summers and made sure to always plug our electric vehicles when the tiers were at a cheaper rate. Southwest Solar gave us a nice breakdown of how much we would save in the long run if we decided to go solar this year. We are able to take advantage of the tax benefits and the job was done nicely with no issues or problems. Great solar company as me and my family had a wonderful experience with this company. They took care of everything and did an amazing job on my home.</text>

<rate>5< /rate><review>With everything going on this year we had decided to take the time and find a solar company to help us with our installation. We are very familiar with solar as we had it installed in our old home before selling it recently. Southwest solar was one of the high rated companies in our area. We ended up using them to work on our house and they did a good job. This company did a nice job and took care of us properly as customer service was excellent!</review>< pics>

Having this company install solar on our home was great as they took care of inspectionsand everything passed the first time as we received a text to keep us updatedon how the job was going. Southwest Solar did a good and quick job as the panels were installedall in one day and we waited for the final inspection to be set within the week due to some delays from the city coming out. Overall great solar experience.< /Review>

Tremendous solar company as they were able to help us go solar and take care of everything before the end of the year. We wanted to make sure we would be able to claim this year's tax credit on our solar system. Southwest solar was easy to work with and very professional.< /Review>

Roof was great as they did replace a few broken tiles and pictures were also provided. I went up to check the work after on the roof and everything looked really nice.

Southwest solar helped me and my family go solar during the pandemic. Obviously we understood there would be some delays as everyone was short staff. Even though my project was on hold and had delays I was very pleased with the weekly updates SW would provide for me, just to let me know my project was a priority for them. Very happy as the job is now done and we are so are pleased with this company.</Review>

Although we decided to go a different route they were very patient and true professionals and I feel that needs to me commended . Thanks for all the time and information you did for our family and sharing amazing info in regards to solar.< /Review>< rating>

<review>Was in the market for new solar panels after the new year and was recommended by a co worker. Was able to get an estimate and a bid within a few days. They worked with my schedule and was able to send a crew out. They had wonderful service and always willing to answer my questions. The crew was here from morning until evening and always cleaned up the mess, I really appreciate the amazing job.</review>< Pictures>

I had a ton of questions with solar, especially with the cost savings on my bill.  They were thorough on explaining the benefits and costs associated with getting panels.  I was utterly impressed with the info provided and will consider solar.  Especially if you live in California its good to get solar with all these heat waves and it does the environment good.  But Southwest Solar is a top choice.</Review>

What a wonderful team to work with. I started off just by calling to get more information about solar but they offered to have a free consult with my wife and I and they took the time to explain everything, provided us a quote based on our wattage and how many panels we would need. They were not overly pushy and tried to get us to do anything. After my wife and I reevaluated our finances we decided to do it with them and it went well.< /Review>

I called Southwest for a solar estimate, they came out to look at my roof after it was done recently and told me since I have shingles that it would be perfect for solar. They had great referrals that I actually called and the previous customers were very happy with there work. Asher and his crew did an awesome job installing new solar to our home.</Review>

Such a great company! Very customer service oriented. Sounds like they are getting busy because the date to start my installs was a bit longer then I expected but they explained to me its because there has a been numerous people getting installs with them which I understand. So book soon if you guys! Other than that everything seems to be in order and I'll get calls from there to assure that I haven't been forgotten which is great.<//review>

<user>104241760602205249748</user><resp>None</resp><Review>After checking a few other companies, we found Southwest Solar. Our sales rep was fantastic from the beginning to end. Once my wife and I made our decision and paid our deposit things moved rapidly. Our project manager was efficient and our solar panels were installed ahead of schedule. Their crew had our solar panels installed in two days. Fantastic company to work with and they were always there when we had any questions.<//Review>< user_name>

Pretty much you get a voucher redeemable for $500 at Southwest Solar. Sweet! Convinced me it was the time to get it done. Spoke with Donna and Amber about the run down on the installs and within a week my house has gone Solar. Easy as that.<//text>< gmap_id>

These guys gave me a very good deal. The solar panels they have are the best. Can’t get any other good price from somewhere else. Keep it up Southwest solar.</Review>

Finally decided to get the solar panels after an entire 2 years of checking and reviewing if it was in my budget. At first I was not to certain if it was going to be worth the amount of money I paid since I bought the panels for the new home but its an investment if you are going to stay long term in your home. The guys were professional and good at explaining the entire process. If youre looking for someone with a fair price and good service they are definitely it.< /Text>

I was looking into getting solar for my house and researched a few other companies before contacting Southwest Solar. They were able to send out a representative right away. The rep was really helpful and knowledgeable. After comparing prices I decided to go with Southwest Solar, as their pricing was super competitive and they were able to start on my job right away. I was very happy with the whole process and would recommend anyone looking into solar to give them a call.</Text>

At first I did not want to gt solar as it was something that was not in my familys immediately budget and I did not like how it would look on my roof, however, after talking to some friends and seeing them get it I reconsidered and called southwest who my buddy used. The price was fair where my family and I could afford it and the benefits seemed great. It was a very smooth process overall and we got it done in time for the summer.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

We went from making a phone call to learn about their company to a quote and install in less than 5 weeks.

Thanks to a close friends referral I happily gone with Southwest Solar. Originally had a lot of mixed opinions about getting solar panels for home. I was told it wouldn't be worth it, I might be ending up spending more, etc. I'm so glad people at Southwest solar explained everything thoroughly and they're very informative and knowledgeable. From the consultation to the installation, everything went with ease. If anyone else is skeptical about getting solar, and don't be shy about calling them!< /review>

Called up a few places before going solar. SW shared a lot off good references upon request. They did a good job and we are happy with our 6.2 kw system. Everything is great we have a monitoring system as well to make sure its up and running properly we can check from our phone how cool is that.</review>

We just completed my solar panel installation with Southwest Solar and I couldn't be more pleased. They worked around my busy schedule and I was always able to reach him over the phone or email, then the instillation went smooth and the system looks great on our roof.
This guys are professional with a great customer service,i couldn't be happier with the final result and I can't wait to see how much money I saved on the next bill!<//Review>

<Text>Southwest Solar did a great job at installing my panels. I was in talks with them and few other companies, but why I ultimately chose them was because of their competitive pricing. They were very clear on the taxes and rebates that I would get back, and the install finished 1 day before estimated.

Detail was key to southwest solar getting me as a customer. I take time in selecting the correct companies to do any work on my home. The quality of the panels and inverters they had were top of the line. and the reviews and certificates showed they were most qualified.<//Text>

We recently had our solar system installed by Southwest Solar and I have to say the entire process went as well as I could have imagined. The Sales Team/energy consultants answered all of my questions during the initial phone call and meeting. They were extremely knowledgeable and experienced than other solar companies I met with. They broke down the tax benefits and the rest were easy decisions. Within a day and a half, my 5.8kW system was installed, but it did take a few days to turn the system on because of delay from my utility company. I heard this is normal for there to be slight delays. All in all, I would recommend Southwest Solar to anyone thinking about going solar.</text>

Feeling hesitant about going Solar? Speak with anyone that works at Southwest Solar and you will be convinced that it’s the right place to go. Can’t get over how nice and informative the service reps were I believe Robert and Jacob was the ones I spoke with and I never felt any forcefulness from any of them. Mostly importantly they did a great job with our installs!<//review>

Also one of the companies I got an estimate for solar with. Asher was my first encounter and he was great. He really knew his stuff from the installation of the solar panels to explaining and answering all my questions. Price was they were just as competitive as everyone else. It's definitely really tough and I feel like I'm purchasing a car when it comes to solar. Im glad they came out to go over what they can do for me and highly recommend giving this company a call if your looking into getting solar.</review>

I am in the process of remodeling my home and decided to look into solar. As a first time buyer I had so many questions regarding the process, cost, investment, rebates incentives, etc. Southwest Solar's team was extremely helpful and patient with me when answering any of my questions. They are not only professional but also very knowledgeable. I highly recommend Southwest Solar for all of your solar needs!</Review>

<text>Southwest Solar did an awesome job on my home install. Although, it was finished a day later then expected I understood the reasoning behind it. They wanted to take the extra time to assure everything was installed and working perfectly. I appreciated the extra effort they did to check to assure I was happy with the install.< /text>< pictures>

Been looking into Solar installs for awhile and saw on Yelp that Southwest was having a promo $200 for $500 Deal. Pretty much you get a voucher redeemable for $500 at Southwest Solar. Sweet! Convinced me it was the time to get it done. Spoke with Donna and Amber about the run down on the installs and within a week my house has gone Solar. Easy as that.< /Text>

Great company to work with. We had them install solar and it turned out great. Panasonic panels which we wanted and they gave us the best price possible. They started within 1 week and finished in 3 weeks and ready to operate.<//text>

<Review>Working in real estate it is important to help my clients increase the value on their homes. I like recommend vendors that can help increase the value of their homes in efficient and cost effective ways. When it comes to solar energy I always refer my clients to Southwest Solar and I have always received excellent feedback.Their team is thorough, knowledgeable and they really want their clients to be happy with their purchase. The systems  are excellent and installed by professional, skilled workers who take pride in their work.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

He took the time to explain the benefits of solar and checked on my electricity usage to see if it would be a good fit .If you want the best bang for the buck, A system that is installed quickly, safely and professionally, you will likely not find a better company to do the job. I stand firmly behind Southwest solar.<//Text>< date>

This is actually the 2nd property that I had Southwest Solar install solar panels at. I found them through a Yelp advertisement a few months ago and gave them a call. They were very professional and gave a lot of useful tips and advice on the rebates I would receive, even if I chose not to go with them. I sat on the information for a few weeks and decided to move forward with them. They do great work and will be working on another rental property of mine within the next few weeks. Love the great effort these guys put into being professionals!< /Review>

My wife and I hired Southwest Solar to install our panels just before the holidays. We were actually thinking about going with a competitor, but ultimately decided to work with these guys. Danny is super awesome and very friendly. They have an overall friendly vibe and I've already referred these guys to my aunt and uncle for a 2019 Solar project. Great professionals.< /Text>

<review>I was referred to southwest solar by a relative who had gotten their solar done by the company. Their prices were competitive but their customer service is what really made me decide to go with them. They were really knowledgeable and answered all my questions and concerns. The installation of the panels only took a couple a couple of days and soon I was up and running. I really recommend that anyone looking into getting solar check this company out.</review><GmapID>0x80c296901f34c333:0xb2aab49e1ddb0a2f</GmapID><rate>5< /rate><Response>None</Response>< Date>

This was the only company that not called me back but also took the time to come to my house within 3 business days to check out my room and give me a quote. I have called so many others and either received no response or unfriendly customer service. They did a great job in working with my budget, providing me options, and giving me blueprints and realistic timelines for when they would be done. Happy to start off 2019 right.< /review>

Was not to sure about solar until I saw one of my neighbors getting it installed and how affordable it was. He said his bill was $0 and there was  no way I believed him until I got my quote. They did a great job in explaining it to my mom and I the cost benefit analysis, how it will pay itself overtime and mainly that they would take care of everything for us. They even did a through inspection of my room made sure a few things were patched up and ready to go prior to installing the panels. I cannot say enough about the great customer service, they were able to work with my schedule and did a wonderful job with everything</review>

In the past few years my electricity bill has been through the roof and looked into solar.  I shopped around the various companies in LA and came across southwest solar.  These guys are amazing and the prices were very affordable.  They walked us through the whole process and they were very informative from beginning to end.  I even scheduled them to see my parents home to help them save money as well.< /Text>

Our Solar guide is what I like to call it named David was such a fantastic help. He helped my neighbours with their Solar installs so I knew he was the one to go to for help. He walked us through the process because myself and husband had no idea about Solar besides it saving money on electricity. It took about a week to get done and so far its been working great. I trust that I will have no issues with my solar.</text>

<review>Also one of the companies I got an estimate for solar with. Asher was my first encounter and he was great. He really knew his stuff from the installation of the solar panels to explaining and answering all my questions. Price was they were just as competitive as everyone else. It's definitely really tough and I feel like I'm purchasing a car when it comes to solar. Im glad they came out to go over what they can do for me and highly recommend giving this company a call if your looking into getting solar.</review></record>

This review has been long overdue but finally getting to it. I have officially been operating on solar for 7 months now and all i can say is save your money and get it because its SO worth it. I am so impressed by the price it costed and the benefits my family and I are now receiving because of it.</Text>

Dependable solar company. It's really tough to find a company that can honestly do what they say. After seeing my next door neighbors experience I felt comfortable to move forward with SW. They did an amazing job and gave a great price on the complete job.<//text>

They had the exact solar panels I was looking for and best of all it was for an unbeatable price compared to the other bids I received. They had everything drawn out and ready to go. I was so impressed by the level of work I have recommended them to 3 people</Text>

Decided to go solar this year and I was glad I did. I was unsure if this was a cost effective investment but the amount of electricity I am using it only makes sense. I looked into a few companies and decided that the most cost efficient company was southwest solar. They were able to match competitor pricing and also get the job done in a short amount of time. I was worried about hidden cost but they were upfront about everything from the beginning. I am glad I decided to get solar, will definitely be using my central AC this summer.< /Review>

I was so impressed with the installs from Southwest Solar with my home that I also called them again to do it for my parents home. They were really happy to oblige and currently working on the house. Can't beat it! Best prices with the best service!< /review>

when looking for solar, getting info from just one company is never enough. I had previously looked into 3 companies before deciding to go with southwest solar and i can honestly say I'm glad i choose the correct company. the installers were great and got right to work the first day here, they had the whole work area clean and dandy and i couldnt be more pleased with the work!< /Text>

My family was very pleased with Southwest Solar's work on this project. Their crew showed up on time and explained the work that they were doing, and were helpful and patient with my family's  basic electrical questions. The owner handled the installation design and was very responsive to my questions and suggestions about improvements to the design. The solar panels installation looks clean and tidy and fits in with our house. I've already recommended them to my friends and family!<//text>

Southwest Solar did an awesome job on my home install. Although, it was finished a day later then expected I understood the reasoning behind it. They wanted to take the extra time to assure everything was installed and working perfectly. I appreciated the extra effort they did to check to assure I was happy with the install.<//Text>

After hearing using Solar I can eliminate my electricity bill to $0 was something I had to look into. Edsel was the person I spoke with to help me out with all my Solar questions. What I really liked is that I wasn’t rushed into buying anything and cost wasn’t brought up until I brought it up. I was given the run down on Solar and what was best for me and benefits. After a long talk I’m convinced everyone should go Solar lol. Great service!<//Text>

My brother thought it was be a great idea for us to install solar panels onto out parents home as they are getting a little older and bills are harder to pay. I'm amazed by the saving we are getting each month and i couldn't be happier with the work also! the panels look great on my parents home.<//review>

I found this company on google and they had great reviews so I decided to give them a call. I had an estimate for solar already and didn’t want to go through another appointment so I emailed them my previous estimate . They were able to compare apples to apples get me exactly what I wanted for the price I wanted as well . Easy company to work with job was done right .</Text>

Trust the reviews. Southwest goes beyond when it comes to customer satisfaction. Some places just make the sale and you never hear from them again but Southwest follows up with you and every little detail during the install process. I recommend Southwest to anybody that is thinking about going Solar<//review>

<Name>Crystal James Lauter< /Name><rating>5<//rating><review>Southwest Solar's sales team was incredibly patient in answering all my questions before sending someone out for an estimate to our house. When I spoke to the sales guy, he went through answering my questions with visuals that made it easy to understand. I enjoyed the fact that there was no added pressure but instead added information that made me that much more assured of my choice to go solar. The installation was very smooth and short of the time it took for the utility to respond my experience was top notch. My system has been running well since I have had it on and have referred some of my cousins who were thinking of moving to solar.</review></record>

Gave them a call for an estimate and they were very friendly and welcoming. No pressure on buying so our job was on hold for 2 weeks and then finally gave them a call. They finished the job within days and the install was perfect. Thank you SW solar!</Text>

Finally got a chance to write my review. Ended up going with southwest solar after looking into a few other places and this was byfar the most reasonably priced for the LG panels I wanted. They came in did the job and I have no complaints.< /review>

My husband decided it would be in our best interest if we went solar to help us save in the long run and help our kids as well when we pass down our home to them. I didn't know much about solar until the rep came out and described all the process to us! We couldn't more happy with the job.< /Review>

<text>Southwest Solar was amazing for our house in Burbank.  They were so good at figuring out exactly what we needed; our energy bill has been reduced a lot per month since the installation and couldn't be happier and better yet helping the environment.  I shopped around for the best quotes for months and was glad I went with them, they were very courtesy and all the employees from phone calls to installation knew what they are talking about.< /text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

<review>South west was one of 2 companies we called for a solar and roof estimate, they came out and was very knowledgable about solar and how the complete job would be done. They spent a good amount at my house on the first visit and we set up a second appointment to finalize all the questions we had left and gave them the opportunity to work on out home. It turned out great!< /review>< pictures>

<review>Omg nicest people ever! I talked to 3 different employees when I called and none of them had a bad bone in their body. I was never forced into buying anything and they were happy to explain to me the benefits, risk and process of having a Solar home. I was convinced I was buying from the right place so I did! The installs are being done as we speak! Excellent!< /review>< user_name>

I am in the process of remodeling my home and decided to look into solar. As a first time buyer I had so many questions regarding the process, cost, investment, rebates incentives, etc. Southwest Solar's team was extremely helpful and patient with me when answering any of my questions. They are not only professional but also very knowledgeable. I highly recommend Southwest Solar for all of your solar needs!</Text>

Southwest Solar met all my expectations for solar!  They were very pleasant and courtesy over the phone and during the installation.  I already see the savings on my electricity bill and got it done right before the summer heat.  There are a lot of solar companies in LA, and no one could beat their places!.< /text>

They came out gave me a Honest Evaluation & Appraisal.
Of what everything would cost me , estimated how much time it will take.
They did incredible work and completed the job on time.
I would recommend them to Everyone.

I wish I switched over to Solar sooner! The amount of money you will be saving on electricity is phenomenal! Southwest did an excellent job of convincing me to make that final push converting into Solar. I was worried solar energy wouldn't be powerful enough for my household but I was guided into the right purchase and it works great. Got to get over the worry and into the comfortable stage and you will be glad you switched! Thank you Southwest Solar. You know your stuff!<//text>

<Review>Want to save money on electricity? Go Solar! Want good service? Go Southwest! Honestly, I don't see anywhere else that can top the service and quality of Southwest Solar. Every little detail is broken down for you to make sure you are making the right purchase for your Solar needs. Might even get one for my car.< /Review>< Pictures>

If you are looking into solar installations, Southwest Solar is the company to call. I contacted two other solar companies and Southwest Solar gave the best bid. Professional crew and great service. Glad I made the upgrade to solar and called Southwest Solar.</Text>

<Review>Outside of hearing about Solar energy, I had no idea how the process worked. I called and spoke with David from Southwest Solar and he broke down everything for me from the life expectancy to the pricing and benefits of having a solar panel system. Needless to say, I’m now in the process of having it installed and still a bit nervous about my invest but the occasional check ups from David is very reassuring. Great service! Thank you David!<//Review><rate>5<//rate><user>112139274175222977963</user>< GmapID>

We are liked working with SW Solar as they were the cheapest of all estimates and cared about following up the most. I will definitely refer you guys to family and friends as it was great to go solar with you.< /review>

Was very happy with Southwest solar, there rep asher came out to see me to go over some solar options. I really appreciated all his hard work and going over as many details as possible. I was honest to let him know I was getting 2 more estimates for solar and there was no push or hard sell like some other companies who only offer there price for one day when I tell them im getting other estimates. Appreciate your time.< /text>

We recently had our solar system installed by Southwest Solar and I have to say the entire process went as well as I could have imagined. The Sales Team/energy consultants answered all of my questions during the initial phone call and meeting. They were extremely knowledgeable and experienced than other solar companies I met with. They broke down the tax benefits and the rest were easy decisions. Within a day and a half, my 5.8kW system was installed, but it did take a few days to turn the system on because of delay from my utility company. I heard this is normal for there to be slight delays. All in all, I would recommend Southwest Solar to anyone thinking about going solar.</Text>

Going solar was tough for us in the beginning as we didn't know much. We wanted to help the environment and save money as well because this was an investment in our home and we really saw savings within the next months.</review>

I looked up the top 3 companies for solar in my area set up an appointment and south west was the one company that I felt relly comfortable hiring to do the installation was they were the most knowledgable compared to the other 2 companies. THey spent the most time and cared about the process and finish. SOLAR is the way to go and southwest is the company to di it with.< /Review>
