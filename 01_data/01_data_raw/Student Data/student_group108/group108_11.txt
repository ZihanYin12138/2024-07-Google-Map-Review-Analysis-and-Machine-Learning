Absolutely worth the money!!!   My flight left at 6:30 AM so I needed a pick up at 4 AM Zach pulled in right at 3:55!   He was nice, professional and most of all SAFE!!!   I’ve had bad rides a few times from this location to the airport at these early hours and I didn’t feel that at all!   Will use you every time I’m there which is a lot!

Thank you so much!</text>

<review>I traveled to San Diego for a business meeting with a client and booked Gold Coast Town Car Service. Mike was a pleasure to work with—very professional, personable, and timely. The travel experience was top-notch, and I'd recommend Mike and Gold Coast Town Car Service to anyone!< /review><Rating>5<//Rating>< username>

<Text>My now-husband and I hired Gold Coast for our transportation from our wedding, through a few stops, and finally to our hotel in San Diego. Beautiful and clean car! Our driver Juan was above and beyond. Not only on time, but early, eager and ready for us when we were ready to leave our wedding party. He was seriously one of the best drivers we had EVER seen. Knew exactly where he was going, attentive, and friendly. We were actually sad to say goodbye to him when the trip was done! If possible, ask for Juan when hiring Gold Coast - you will NOT be disappointed. We will definitely be using this service again!</Text>< pics>

Experience stress-free transportation with Mike & Team at Gold Coast Town Car.  For 7+ years in San Diego and Hawaii, my family gets impeccable service in meticulously clean, luxurious vehicles. Every staff member is professional, friendly, calm, capable. Seamless &  proactive: When our international flight was delayed, Gold Coast proactively pinged us, to say all was well.

We have been using Gold Coast Town Car Services for the past 6 years to and from the San Diego Airport. Mike and his team are fantastic !  The cars are immaculate, the drivers are friendly and professional and their fees are very reasonable.  They are always on time and it is easy to make arrival and departure changes when the airlines have schedule changes.  We have referred several friends who feel the same.  A great company.</Review>

Mike and his team are amazing. I’ve never experienced a group that goes over and above what one would expect as they do. Mike and Anthony are top notch, you couldn’t ask for two better guys to make sure you’re getting where you need to go, as well as being so knowledgeable with the area and making any trip or tour a lasting memory. They are the only people I would recommend and are the only company I use when I come to town. Thank you guys for being who you are.< /Review>

Absolutely the most professional and dependable car service on Hawaii Island and in the Southern California area. They are our go-to car service for transport to and from San Diego and Kona International airports. Returning home to Kailua-Kona from travels, the longtime drivers have become friends over the years providing the friendliest, aloha-filled welcome home! Highly recommended!< /Text>

For more than five years Mike and Gold Coast have been our reliable, safe, and comfortable travel transportation.  We know when we contact them that we can relax and get to and from the airport worry free. They've even provided service from LA train station for our son and his family. Travel is stressful enough.
Call Mike and let him take part of the stress away. Gold Coast deserves a gold star.</review>

<text>These guys are the real MVPs!  I had a group of 10 putting together a big bash all the way from San Diego to the House of Blues in Anaheim.  We needed a Limo in San Diego that wouldn't be afraid to drive on up to Disney.  Mike here at Gold Coast wasted no time in his response to help me put this together.  Fast and easy booking process, check!  Friendly and professional chauffeur, check!  Competitive and all-inclusive rates, check!  Super sick Mercedes Sprinter Limo, check!  Everyone happy and a damn good time, check!  Thanks again Gold Coast, we will be back for more.<//text>< pictures>

Fabulous tour of San Diego for first time visitors, 2 teenagers.  Anthony was fabulous with pickup from airport and delivery at resort at end of tour.  Very scenic and informative tour with stops for shopping, photos and lunch.  Great way to get overview of city and Anthony was so friendly and engaging.  The teenagers loved it!<//review>

Called up Visa Concierge last minute (midnight the night before for a 6am pickup). They pulled through and booked a car for myself and four colleagues with Gold Coast. Honestly, I had no idea what to expect but as soon as our driver (Anthony) picked us up my anxiety was immediately relieved! Anthony was as professional as can be. He went above and beyond to make sure our journey was seamless. With a little extra time at the end of our trip, he graciously gave my colleagues and I a tour of San Diego and surrounding areas. His knowledge was remarkable and it was an extremely pleasant experience overall. Car itself was excellent- luxurious, clean and tidy. Perfect for executive and business use.

Thank you again, Anthony!<//Text>

<text>My family and I had the pleasure of working with Mike and Anthony while we visited San Diego. To say that they are both exceptional professionals would be an understatement. I had extensive interaction with Mike prior to the trip in coordinating various excursions that we had planned and details that kept changing, and he was always extremely timely and kind and accommodating in his responses. We first met Anthony when we arrived at the airport, and we were so impressed by what a genuine gentleman and knowledgeable professional he was that we requested him for our other excursions, and Mike did his very best to accommodate that request. My family had unique needs, and both Anthony and Mike went out of their way to meet those needs and to make our excursions so very enjoyable and comfortable. As a federal criminal defense attorney, I am extremely particular and always look for people who practice their professions in the manner in which I practice law. Mike and Anthony are at the top of their profession, and I highly recommend them without any reservation and look forward to working with them again in the future.<//text></record>

We have been using Mike for several years and he is the only consistently reliable service we have found in San Diego.  Professional, friendly service and always on time (actually always arrives early).  Perfect for transfers to SAN and LAX airports or even a trouble-free relaxing ride to Vegas if you want to avoid the hassles of flying or driving yourself.  Unlike the inconsistent and often regrettable experiences we have had, using the well-known car service apps on our phones,  Mike and his team never disappoint and will always be our go-to for any car service needs in San Diego.  Even for last minute rides you may need late at night, or for a spontaneous getaway without much advance notice, or a last minute itinerary change, Mike and his team are always accommodating.  Anytime we contact Mike with a question or to set up a ride, he gets back to us right away, making trip planning quick, easy, and painless.<//Text>

<review>5 STAR all the way!  Mike, Alan and Alan made our wedding anniversary trip to San Diego stress free with their SUPERB service. Not only did they meet my somewhat last minute schedule, they did it with professionalism, kindness and a can do attitude. They all made my husband and me feel like we were family and not simply a client.  I was handed a rose of all things on our ride to dinner one night! Amazing group of individuals.  Thank you ALL so much.  I HIGHLY recommend GOLD COAST TOWN CAR SERVICES to anyone that visits San Diego or surrounding areas.  I will be back!!< /review>< user>

Bottom line, they are the best town car service company available.  I don't normally take the time to write reviews for companies, but this one went above and beyond what was required of them that I want to let others know what an outstanding company they are.

They have excellent communication and are so accommodating to their customers' needs.  They are really on top of things.  When their passenger's plane was delayed, they still were there when they landed as they monitor the passenger's flight status and plan accordingly.< /review>

<Review>Michael was nice to work with.  I can see why he has a full 5 star review without a single ding.    Much better than an Uber. Going to be using Michael for all airport trans going forward.< /Review>< gmap_id>

We've hired Gold Coast on four occasions. Each time, the driver was VERY early, incredibly friendly, and extremely professional! All that, and really reasonable pricing has earned our business for life!</Review>

<Gmap_id>0x80d9553afcd7730b:0x481b3d59c9765ce5< /Gmap_id><Text>I absolutely love Gold Coast and their staff!!!!

I first learned of the car service back in November 2016, from a colleague who recommended them for taking me to the airport for business travel.

I have not strayed since.

I refuse to use an uber or lyft simply because of the impeccable service Mike and his team provides. I love their SUVs, usually Tahoe sized and above. Always clean inside, and it smells amazing!

Whoever comes to pick you up from home/airport will help you with your bags, which I truly appreciate as I am not as physically capable as I used to be in my youth.

The staff appearance is professional, usually in either a full suit or business casual -- more on the business side. Their attitudes and friendliness go a long way. I appreciate every ride they have ever given me.

You can't go wrong with Gold Coast. They have never left me stranded, no matter what time of the day I need to be picked up. I think the latest/earliest time once was when I arrived into San Diego at 3:00 AM! Mike always makes sure that either he or another one of his drivers is there to take you home safely.

If for whatever reason, the driver gets held up, they will let you know and communicate it to you ASAP via text or phone call. One time a driver of mine got held up by traffic. No big deal, I was able to kill time by smoking a cigarette and stretching my legs after a long flight.

They are very accommodating to the fact that stuff happens! If your flight gets delayed, just text Mike ASAP and he will make sure that there is someone there to get you.

5 stars to Mike and his team. You guys are awesome!<//Text><user_name>Sandy M</user_name>< Response>

NEVER GO HERE!!! I BROUGHT MY BRAND NEW $195.00 YOKOHAMA SPARE TIRE AND RIM IN SO THAT I COULD HAVE MY ORIGINAL RIM PUT ON MY BRAND NEW YOKOHAMA TIRE. WHEN HE WAS TAKING MY BRAND NEW TIRE OFF THE SPARE HE RIPPED THE TIRE. HE PROCEEDED TO TELL ME IT WAS ALREADY RIPPED WHEN I KNEW IT WASNT. HE PROCEEDED TO ARGUE WITH ME AND TELL ME IT WAS ALREADY RIPPED AND SOMEHOW GOT ME TO BUY A USED TIRE FROM HIM. NEVER GO HERE. I BOUGHT A USED TIRE for 60.00 I DIDNT REALIZE WHEN I LEFT THAT IT WAS ALL CRACKED AND VERY OLD. TWO DAYS LATER I COULD HEAR A LEAK AND TIRE WAS GETTING FLAT VERY RAPIDLY. WENT BACK TO SEE IF IT WAS FIXABLE, TOLD ME NO AND TOLD ME HE’D SELL ME ANOTHER USED ONE FOR 40.00. VERY BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE, SELLS BAD USED TIRES. DOES NOT TAKE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR MESSING PEOPLES STUFF UP. HE SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT ME A BRAND NEW YOKOHAMA TIRE FOR THE ONE THAT HE RIPPED WHILE
TAKING OFF MY SPARE RIM. DO NOT RECCOMEND. WENT DOWN THE STREET TO CHEAP TIRE SHOP. GOT A USED TIRE THAT LOOKED LIKE NEW FOR ONLY 40.00. DO NOT BUY USED TIRES FROM THEM DO NOT SWAP TIRES ONTO RIMS HERE BECAUSE IF THEY MESS UP THEY WILL MAKE YOU PAY.</text>

I called an talked a pleasant gentleman, I explained that I had a flat and told him my tire size, he had it available and quoted the price. Once I got my car towed. I sat in a nice clean waiting area and within 15 minutes I was on my way. Great customer services<//review>

If I could put NO STARS!!! i totally would. i called and stated who i was just because i call from a work phone does not mean that is what im calling about i NEEDED tires while i was at work stuck this shop is only 6 min away from my office but i continuously got hung up on they would answer and hang up would not even say anything just answer hang up exactly 12 times. Horrible assumtion and you just lost business for 3 vehicles i had and wanted all new tires for all 3 of them. Sorry for your business. I do not reccomend this shop i went to URGENT TIRES FOLSOM very nice hear you out and give you great deals< /Review>

I bought a set of 22s and the tire bubbled the second week and rim bent very easy all I wanted was a discount on 1 new tire after spending 1250 on a set of rims they don't care about the loyalty of a customer iv came here for years they lost my business for good don't be cheap like I did spend the extra money with the right people  might be cheapest rims around but they are very low quality they bend easy and the tires they sell with them will bubble up on the first bump you hit<//text>

So on Sunday around 2 pm my daughter and I was driving and I noticed a weird shaking coming from the front of my car so I get out and check my tires and I notice a bubble on my driver tire so i go to the neariest and open tire shop and the gate was open and there was a customer getting a tire so has I pull in I run over there little rail they have on the ground for there gate and it completely separated my tire and I get out and I walk in and the guy looks at me and says we are closed go around the corner to the other tire shop I bring him out and show him my tire that's completely in half and he says oh you can make it I say okay so I go to back out to turn around to pull out of there parking lot my tires completely blows and he looks at me and say man really okay what do you want a new or used and I said how much for new he says 65$ for new and 35$ for used I have never been so disrespected ever .</text>

<text>Great service, efficient. Pleasant surprise is that they accept debit or cerdit cards. Charged $1 if using debit or credit. Did not give it 5 stars as signage for enterance is bad and had to stand in front of garage for employee to come out and help us.<//text>< pics>

Crooked people who will sell you tires lie about warranty and not honor the warranty. Bought 2 new tires they said 35K warranty after 2 months 1 of tires have a bubble and they say their is no warranty.Now 2nd tire has same type of bubble VERY CROOKED PEOPLE<//Text>

Overcharged! Every other rim shop in the neighborhood only charges $10 to take a tire off and put a new one on this one charges 15 only reason I stayed was because there was no one else there and I don't feel like driving up the street but I'd rather go up the street next time and save five bucks and get me a hot and ready from Little Caesars</review>

I came in looking for a smoothie and fries and they delivered great service. Their shoestring fries are tasty and the portion sizes are gigantic! Don't order the large fries unless you're committed. The kahuna smoothie I ordered had bananas, mangos and strawberrys. Yummm

Apparently there's this challenge named after this football kid. I forget the name. But If you can manage to eat a triple cheeseburger, medium chili cheese fries and a large shake, the meal is free and you get a T-shirt for bragging rights.</Review>< time>

Nice little place not far from the bike trail.  Portion is generous.  Food is typical of Mom n Pop restaurant.   Ideal for takeout if you're riding bikes and eat at the Libbey Park.< /review>

Great portion sizes, great prices, and the owner is a very friendly, down to earth, Navy veteran.

Had a good time chatting with him and another patron who happened to also be a Navy veteran while waiting for my order. Highly recommend.<//Text>

I came here because I've heard good things about the food. I understand that they were busy with all of the high school kids, but the cashier was very rude. Seemed irritated and absolutely no manners. I paid with a card and he slammed the receipt and pen down on the counter. For my first visit here, I did not feel welcome. I thanked him and he didn't even bother to look at me. Good prices and food. Terrible customer service. The cook had better customer service than the cashier.<//review>

Can't say enough good things about this place! Great burger with a super tasty relish, amazing fries (and the biggest portion I've ever had!), yummy homemade ranch dressing and fry sauce, and the friendliest owner & wife duo! Definitely recommend this spot if you are in the area! Will be back :)< /Review>

<review>Fries absolutely rock, burger is nothing special but very ok none the less.  It would really help if the staff wasn't higher than a kite but what do you want it's a seaside community with out a lot of options.  Pricey  very pricey.<//review>< Rating>

Basically a snack shack with tables. Burgers are frozen patties and the shakes are made with water (the shake machine in back was broken so they used water from the soda machine to make them). Onion rings were quite good but their house Hi-sauce wasn’t to my liking.< /review>

I call this place happy burger, because it makes me happy with: great food, true ojai short order food that tastes great, great owners/employees/and the constant flow of regulars.  Have had everything on menu and will continue to return for my lunchbreaks.  Word to the wise// the local high school has been known to  rampage here 3-4pm.< /Review>

<text>The Food is basically over priced microwave food. Nothing special about it; no unique taste or style  The cashier tries to be funny with customers but usually comes out rude and makes people feel uncomfortable. There are plenty of other options to pick from when eating  in the ojai area before settling for this place.< /text>< Pics>

They are thieves.  I returned a $15 item and they straight gave me a gift card for $2.   I called their customer service they send me to the store.  The store sends me back to the 800#.     Never will I shop there again</text>

They not only have an over all welcoming atmosphere here, but they take the extra step to make you feel like family. They are vastly knowledgeable with just about any question I asked.
One of the coolest things is their games nights are completely free to join in on! They also have nights to teach beginners how to play certain games!
Aside from board games they Also do card games and have figurines for sale.
You must check this place out!<//text>< user>

Amazing staff, honestly one of my favorite places to find stuff and geek out. I have had a few figures for d&d painted for my wife and I and they went above and beyond every time.
They have tables where people play card games which is nice, and a vast assortment of tabletop games. The lady at the front was always helpful. The atmosphere is always casual and welcoming. If I could rate it more than 5 stars I would.<//Text>

<Text>Amazing game store! Whatever gaming hobby your into they have it. From D&D to Warhammer, from Settlers of Catan to Pokemon, and from Magic the gathering to more obscure tabletop gaming titles. My personal favorite is D&D and they have everything I need. Come here for a fun tabletop gaming atmosphere.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x80dc99bc1009eb6d:0xd0dd1de4206a28c6<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Everything you could want in a game store.  Friendly and knowledgeable staff that go out of their way to make you feel welcome.  Loads of playing space available, with quality tables and chairs.  Their two wargame tables are loaded with custom terrain and buildings for good battles.  Wide variety of stock on the shelves, not just games but accessories and clothing.  Drinks and snacks are available, and they let you bring outside food in too.  They also have a large demo game library, if you want to try a new game.   Worth the drive, this will be my new spot.  Rogue Knight Games is great!<//text>

Cool place, good vibes. The guys are really nice there. I usually have to order or go out of town to purchase pokemon booster boxes so I am glad I found this store! I will be back to purchase more merchandise.

Thanks again!</review>

Fantastic staff, wonderful events for all interests, and plenty of seating and space. Tuesday nights they have a board game night where you can learn to play many new games with the staff or other visitors. 10/10 would recommend.< /Review>

I wanted to take this opportunity to thank the proprietors of Rogue Knight for a number of reasons. I've been bouncing back and forth between local game stores for years, and every place I've tried to settle into has ended up not working out. Sometimes the staff are dismissive or aloof. Sometimes the clientele are elitist. Some stores offer a limited selection or uncompetitive prices. Some stores are a perfect storm of all of these things.

Rogue Knight is special. From the moment I walked in that first time, I was greeted warmly and genuinely. The staff wasn't bothered by my presence. They approached me, engaged with me and helped me find my way around. They took an active interest in what I was looking for and proved themselves extremely knowledgeable about everything they carry.

The people who frequent Rogue Knight are as friendly as the staff. I've met and played with complete strangers, exchanged contact information gladly and even gotten a taste of new games and hobbies.

Even as a new store, Rogue Knight's selection is considerable. The store is neat and cleanly organized. It's easy to shop and even easier to find something worth buying. Of particular note for rpg fans like me is an impressive array of D&D 5e and Pathfinder products. And if you can't find what you're looking for, the staff is willing to either try hunting it down and ordering it or recommending something very close. All of this with competitive prices to boot.

Add all of this together and throw in generous operating hours, an open and clean floor-space and plenty of demo games to pass the time and you do have a perfect storm; the kind of perfect storm that keeps you coming back and making new friends, diving into new hobbies and creating great new memories.

Once again, thank you guys so much. Consider this the endorsement of someone who had long ago given up finding a game store that would work. I cannot begin to express how nice it is to have finally found that place.

Thanks guys.</text>

<Review>This place is great. Most of the time you can walk in and just join a game. They have MTG tournaments, DND, Warhammer, and tons of other games. They even have chess on the tables near the front. The atmosphere is great too. Sometimes you walk in and get pulled into a game you never even planned on playing.</Review>< Pics>

<Review>Very, very rude. I won't be coming back. My boyfriend and I have been playing dnd for years, and were excited to travel across town to this new store; which was, unfortunately, an absolute mistake.

We weren't greeted coming in, and when we split up to look at different things they only acknowledged my boyfriend; in the 20 minutes we were shopping not one of the three male employees greeted me or even made eye contact with me. Due to their offensively bad customer service they have lost our business.

The rude female employee, I'm guessing the wife of the manager, overheard us discussing our decision not to give them our business, only then attempting to be polite. When we first walked in we tried to strike up conversation with her, because she was at the front desk and we had a few questions, but she was simply off putting and rude. Due to the poor customer service that all four employees displayed today, we will not be coming back.< /Review>< pictures>

It was a nice park, fairly maintained, from a distance you see plush green grass, nice play ground equipment, with wooded bedding, nice big shade tress, perfect for an afternoon walk or play, wrap around sidewalks, basketball courts. What you can't see is the trash and other disturbing items along the walk around the park... When you start walking through the grass you find containers with melted holes and a straw mechanism twisted through it, razor blades by tress, dirty pooped boxers by the wall, pickle container trash, ropes around trees, bums at tables with all their belongings, bums laying in the grass, people dropped off in the parking lot meeting up with the bums in the grass... Bums asking if we bread our dogs, and barking at them... We walked 2 laps and left... I would recommend unless you just wanted to pee your dog real quick, like we did. Will not return, its sad what parks have become, because theres no proper place for the homless bums to stay...< /text>

this Frances girl is extremely attractive and helpful to the organization as a whole. As a people person, her communication skills are extraordinary and she helped me get exactly what i needed in a timely manner. She should be promoted or at least get a raise from her current salary.<//text>

<Rating>1</Rating><review>We had a disastrous experience with a return! My family and I shop mostly on line because of the pandemic. We have two small children. Sometimes items don't work out so we might need to return or exchange one item, never more than two. We have a gap card and love to earn points so we use it all the time. The 1st time returning they couldn't find our transaction. The second time they couldn't find our transaction and gave my husband a store credit. Went back the other day, and once again they couldn't find it! They never asked if we had a gap card, they assumed my husband bought it from an outlet! The only reason we were returning was because they sent us the wrong item, and charged us for the item ordered! They "assumed" we would only buy from outlet and didn't even bother to look for the transaction. We had our receipt in our email, but this mall blocks all signal when you are inside so we couldn't bring it up! I will never shop in this location again. I'm saddened that the Burlingame store closed. Horrible customer service! I even spoke to the store manager, and she knew exactly what she had done to my husband! So angry with them!</review>< pics>

Great customer service!
I was serviced by Melissa, who offered me a gap reward + renewed my old expired gap card. She acted in a polite and  professional manner.  She talked me into signing up which turned out as great advantage

Thank you!</text>

<review>If you want to call and see if they have a certain product in stock, don’t bother. The sales associate will answer your call and pretend like they can’t hear you and then hang up on your purposefully. I called twice and I know there was not any issue with the call. The third time no answer.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Absolutely the best bakery to be found in Merced! Today was my first day going there and I was not disappointed! This place is hands-down one of the best bakeries I have ever been to and the people are super nice and super helpful! You have gained a loyal customer in me and even though I have to drive all the way from Mariposa to get there I will make my weekly trip because it is worth it!!< /review>

Is hard to find vegetarian food that tastes good. This place was God sent..not only do I get tasty vegetarian food but is also affordable and no one looks or sounds annoyed about me asking for no meet. I am generally grateful and sad because I move back to San Francisco soon and I want to pack this whole place and take it with me 😭😭😭 you guys are amazing and helped made difficult days bearable. Thank you so much and I will keep praying that you guys have success dispite Covid 🙏</Text>

I rarely give a full five stars. I often want to give four and a half or three and three quarters stars but this place deserves five. They are exactly what they say they are, a Panaderia.

Yes, they have other Foods, they have delicious hot foods made right there for you as well, ice cream, other market sundries you might need for your food especially if you cook latin-style periodically.

But today I went there for lots of pan, Mexican sweet breads. The lady was really sweet, we spoke in Spanish, the other girls that have helped me there also really awesome.

I've never actually sat down to eat there. I'm usually in a hurry, but you can't beat great Mexican sweetbreads and the price is amazing! Go there. You won't be disappointed. If you want fancy-schmancy go somewhere else. If you want the real deal go here.<//Text>

Great rice pudding and pastries! They don't always have the rice pudding, and I'd suggest coming earlier to get fresher bread. The concha + pasteles (birthday cake?) are good, and some of the cream-filled ones are good too!<//Review>

Cake was overly soggy, besides that if you can't deliver when stated and not an hour n a half later, Have the decency to call your clients! They do have things going on instead of trying to wait around.  Should have gotten a discount or something. One more thing if you can't handle the demand get some help.<//Review>< Resp>

This is the best bakery in Merced, Mexican or otherwise. It's not easy to find, they could probably do with a new sign but they are always busy so I guess they don't need it. The baked goods are awesome. I also like the hot food that I have tried so far. The tamales have a perfect meat:masa ratio and everything always tastes fresh which is always a good thing. There's also a little ice cream shop on one side of the store. From outside you wouldn't even know it was a bakery if not for the smell of fresh baked goodness you can smell from a distance. I am sure that those bigger mercado type stores have their benefits but I know where to go to get quality and taste. The prices are even better too!</text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) The best of the best in regards to Mexican bread, I love the rolls that are made there, nor the large chain stores reach them and not only do they have bread, but I also recommend many Mexican products

<Text>(Translated by Google) Yesterday I went with my daughter to eat at this place. I regretted seeing the. That she attended us very credulous and from Malaga. Carnitas Latorta that I asked for the tough meat. And well buttery. And the customer service is terrible, but the worst, but not all of those who work there are like that, some are very friendly, but to get it better, I'm not going back to that store. 9-17-18 east. Day I went to the owners of the store, pretend well, who they put to tend to people because this woman just twisted her face and even my girl was treated badly, it was like 4pm

(Original)
Ayer fui con mi hija a comer a este lugar. Me arrepenti de aver ido la. Que nos atendio muy creida y de malaga. Latorta de carnitas que pedi malisima la carne dura. Y bien mantecosa. Y la atencion al cliente pesima pero de lo peor pero no todas las que trabajan ahi son asi ai algunas muy amables pero para atinarle yo mejor ya no buelvo a esa tienda. 9-17-18 este. Dia fui alos dueños de la tienda finjense bien aquien ponen a tender ala gente por que esta mujer nomas torciendo la cara y hsta a mi niña la atendio pesimo eran como las 4pm</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x8091425a397e5f6f:0x14d743d72825d7fb< /gmapID></record>

<review>It was cute! Several bits of delicious looking vegetables and fruits. I got some great looking, tasty strawberries. The varieties of honies are exciting to peruse. The animals are cute and friendly. There's not a ton here, but what's here is good.<//review>< Pics>

<Review>Every visit to this winery has been fantastic, including the first visit I made when I became a member.  The staff work hard to ensure that the experience there is like no other.  I have been there twice when the power has been out and each time they handle it with grace and sincere earnestness to make sure my visit is just as good as if there was electricity.  I have recommended this winery to friends who have also become members.  This pandemic has not been an easy transition for anyone but I have to say that regardless of the operating conditions, Folded Hills strives to bring the A game!   And don't forget to visit the Farmstand across the way for produce, etc.!</Review>< response>

<Text>I was lucky enough to be at Folded Hills this past weekend for opening day of their new Homestead Winery and Tasting Room. OMG what a cool place this is!! They took the original farmers house - where they used to make pre prohibition wine btw - and completely renovated it while somehow still letting the history of the place shine through. Wow! This place is seriously gorgeous. I had already been to their Montecito Tasting Room (also awesome) so I knew I loved all of the wines, but this place really blew me away. We meant to pop in for an hour or so, and ended up staying all day! Bring a picnic lunch...you won't want to leave. Lots of great areas to hang, inside and out, and enjoy a wine tasting...or in our case a few bottles...of their award winning Lilly Rosé and my favorite, August White! They also have backgammon...bocce ball...cornhole...and even yard farkle!! I'm in heaven. Whoever designed this place is a genius. Grab some bottles to go and don't forget a trucker hat! I've gotten asked like ten times already where I got it! I'll be back soon, I loved it all so much I joined the wine club! Can't wait for the private wine club party this fall!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!< /Text>< pics>

Love this place. You can come and feed goats and pigs. You can also buy their farm produce and more. Plenty of parking space. My husband and I used to come way before it was remoled and bought by a new family. I remember the farm cats that would hang around while you did your produce shopping. Sadly they retired and moved to Hawaii. A beautiful small relaxing place non the less. Worth paying a visit too. Great place to bring the little ones.< /Text>

Killer little Farm outlet
With a number of fairly expensive homemade products.  On the upside they also feature a L2 EV charging point, though in all fairness maybe it should be labeled level 1.5 as its kinda slow.  still if in a pinch for a charge, pull in for a free charge and some homemade goodies.< /review>

Love this Winery! Really a great place!  Tasting rooms are incredible as well as the wine.  Completely renovated farm house...beautiful. Plenty to do or just merely relax and enjoy!  5 Star!  Really enjoyed all the effort and thought that went into Folded Hills! Wonderful people there make much of the environment. Thank you!<//Review>

We go to pick strawberries and raspberries and then in the small store inside we pick up raw organic honey and local baked cookies. A must stop every summer<//Text>< pictures>

Wine is just OK...$25.00 for 5 wine tasting seems a little high. Property is nice.<//Review>

<text>Not only is there organically grown fresh produce, they also sell water and Lori's Original Lemonade as well as local honey and fresh eggs. And more! A litter of pigs, a couple of goats a cow and miniature donkey are out back for petting. When you are on the road and need a break, this is the place to stop. Friendly service. Love this place!< /text>< pics>

Driving up from LA, we always make it a point to stop here. Unbelievably fresh vegetables and fruit. Compare the taste by purchasing the same items you buy here from your local market. Only then will you see the HUGE difference.  Also, the staff here could not be friendlier. I highly recommend this place.< /review>

< review>
I was at the water trap a week ago and I thought I had lost my phone. I did vacuuming and I was able to get my car real clean especially the blower helped. When I couldn’t find my phone Randy help me by calling the phone number and seeing if it would ring in the car. It didn’t but he was so confident and impressed me so much with his willingness to help and his compassion for caring about my predicament and how all of us feel when we can find our phones. I think Randy is a great asset to your business and I was so glad to cross paths with him.

Friendly people, good all around wash except the roof of my Jeep did not get washed and the rear hatch window was streaky. Also you should probably stop and use their cleaning stations to get excess moisture and dust out of your crevices (I didnt because mines squeaky clean on the inside), overall good job for the price.< /Text>

Convenient local car wash site. They offer a few car wash options with different rates. Recommend the monthly fee which will save you plenty of money. Because it's new, you have a new site with vaccums, blowers, brushes and stalls. Let's see if the service and the upkeep lasts over time. Recommend it!<//Review>

One of the best car wash experiences I’ve ever had. The staff was so friendly and helpful. I’ve been to a few other Waterdrops locations and they never fail to amaze me. I DEFINITELY recommend to everyone and anyone.<//review>

This is the coolest car wash ever!!! Today was the opening and they were offering free car washes. We met the lady, which was really nice, and she pointed us towards the wash entry. Don't let me forget how much fun it was, they have lights and all types of stuff. It cleaned the car beautifully 😍.  I'd definitely recommend to At least try it out. Thank you. Also there is a buffer at the end that gets rid of streaks.<//Text>

<Text>Not impressed. Paid for the most expensive and hood buffer at the end didn't come down. Then the "spot free rinse" didn't fully rinse and yes, ton of spots! Then the dryer was so quick it didn't dry much to the point we had to pull into their vacuum area and fully wipe down from the excess water and the already mentioned non "spot free rinse". Sure all the lights and colorful wax is pretty but something needs to happen to change these issues.<//Text><user_name>Dan A< /user_name><Rating>2<//Rating><Time>1614656199884</Time></record>

Nice having 2 locations close the rose one gets super packed this one is new and empty I was wondering how they were going to make it work but it does wraps around , you turn left go straight back then wraps around to some that come out and she scanned my monthly and moved the cones and I was off ....car was really clean 👍 only issue was someone came out to guide me in the tracks I was like no one here I figured the lady who scanned me would walk back out again someone else came from other side and sometimes they are confusing when guiding you in 🤷😂</text>

<Review>Quick, and easy.  Bring towel.  I received an advertisement to try them out for free.  Staff was friendly, and helped me through this car wash.  Car came out quite clean.  Even though it had blowers, it still left some wet areas, but there were covered, shaded parking stalls where I parked and dried off areas.  Also it had free vacuuming which was handy</Review><Rate>4</Rate><Gmap_id>0x80e84d1e9bb5b58b:0x69a98e474c56d95</Gmap_id>< Resp>

<Review>(Translated by Google) The best only need to train the staff more since I have membership and they told me that I was not active, I lost 10 minutes and they wanted to remove me from the line, but then a young woman checked my membership online and everything was fine, the system did not work and the young woman He did not know. Train more staff and have more patients with customers who do not want to remove them from the line. When I left vacuuming my car I was driving towards the exit and a worker of a 4-door lexus entered wronway and almost crashed my car !!! Help please

(Original)
The best solo necesitan capacitar más al personal ya que tengo membership y ellos me decías q no estaba activo perdí 10 minutos y me querían sacar de la fila, pero después una joven checo online mi membership y tod estaba bien el sistema n funcionaba y la joven no sabía. Capaciten más al personal y se han más pacientes con los clientes no los quieran sacar de la line .al salir de aspirar mi auto conducía hacia la salida y un trabajador de un lexus 4 puertas entró en wronway  y casi me choca mi auto!!! Help please</Review>< pics>

The doctor keeps up with the latest information. He found a serious conflict between two medications which was especially important to know. And he is an exceedingly kind person. All these attributes are hard to find in doctors these days.
My covid-19 vaccine went very well. Did not feel the shot at all. It was an efficient setup as well.<//text><resp>None</resp>< pictures>

My wife has been seeing Dr Buddiga for about a year now and is very happy that she chose him for her Allergist.  Another thing she likes about the office staff is they WILL ANSWER the phone when you call; you don't get some stupid automated system that makes you jump through numerous hoops when you need to talk to some one.  That in and by itself makes them deserve an A+ rating.<//review><Resp>None</Resp></record></dataset><record>

Excellent allergy clinic! The staff is professional and courteous, the wait has never been long and Dr. Buddiga has been very helpful with treating my two year old daughter’s eczema and allergies. Highly recommend this practice to other parents in the area!</Text>

<Text>I’m a college student that was going to this office for treatment, I didn’t have insurance at first and was for months paying out of pocket for my inhalers, shots, and appointments. Finally got insurance for the last year of my treatment, 6 months before I was completely finished, without calling, texting, leaving a message, emailing, or regular mailing me a warning, they terminated the contract with my insurance, I found out when I went to get my shot on a Tuesday they told me they will not give me the shot, or treat me, there is no referral and no transfer, and I will now have to start this whole process over again. It was also incredibly difficult to get the Doctor to keep up with my prescriptions and I was constantly having to call the office. 1 star.< /Text>< user_name>

Had an amazing experience coming to this Allergy and Asthma Clinic. From the staff up front to the nurses and Dr. Buddiga, everyone was courteous, on time and gave thorough care answering all my questions. This place is family orientated and if you’re looking for a family clinic, look no further!</Text>

Susan was very nice and explained what my insurance covered and the prices of allergy testing before receiving care. This was nice because I wasn’t hit with any surprises after my appointment. The assistants and the Doctor were very nice as well! I’m glad I found this clinic. I will be making an appointment for my husband as well! Looks like we will be coming here for all of our allergy & asthma care.< /review>

Dr. Buddiga spent time with me explaining the virus, how the vaccine works and what to expect in the future with what information is currently available. He is extremely knowledgeable and I am glad that I was able to get vaccinated at Family Allergy Asthma & Skincare.<//text>

I went to Family Allergy Asthma Clinic with my husband to get COVID vaccines and what a great experience! They made sure everyone was being safe by staying socially distant and wearing masks. Dr. Buddiga answered all of our questions and administered the shot himself. It was quick and painless. Dr. Buddiga and his entire staff was so friendly and helpful. Now I'm actually looking forward to going back for my 2nd shot. Thank you Family Allergy Asthma Clinic for helping to keep us all safe!< /Text>

<text>At Family Allergy Asthma Clinic you get a great doctor AND great front office staff. This is important to me because I've often sacrificed my front office experience in order to have access to a great doctor.
Dr. Buddiga takes the time to sit and listen to his patients. He's also caring and honors your time so you aren't left sitting in his waiting room past your scheduled appointment.
One of my family members recommended Family Allergy Asthma Clinic, and it's the best medical recommendation I've had in two decades.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Date>1602529805322<//Date><gmapID>0x80945cd769b28eed:0xb603afcf33e9c92<//gmapID><user_id>115604460378034412945<//user_id>< response>

Dr. Buddiga is a wonderful doctor. I received my first COVID-19 vaccine today. The entire procedure
(paperwork and shot administered) was completed in under 30 minutes. Dr. Buddiga and his entire staff are professional and very friendly and caring. They make you feel at ease. My husband was a patient of Dr. Buddiga’s, until we had to change insurance carriers. We were sad to have to say goodbye to everyone in the office. We highly recommend Family Allergy and Asthma Clinic.</Text>

They canceled my insurance and told me they would not treat me 6 months before my treatment was complete without a text email or message warning. Did not issue me a referral or an antigen continuation so I will have to start over. Thanks for nothing<//text>

Staff upfront are very helpful and knowledgeable. Office is spacious and clean. Dr. Buddiga patiently listens to all your issues. After tests, found out my asthma was being triggered by allergies. Dr. Buddiga got to the bottom of it and got me breathing right again. Glad I found him.<//Text>

<review>Dr. Buddiga is intelligent and a caring Allergist. In our experience with him, we’ve noticed that he is attentitive, listens to us and our concerns, understands the importance of building rapport and has the background experience to identify issues and use his expertise to try and solve it. Our son has a bad case of eczema and with given medications, my sons skin always clears up, but then returns once the prescription is done with. Although we haven’t quite found something that works for our sons skin, we have positive thoughts going forward and seeing what Dr. Buddiga has to offer.< /review>< name>

Until a friend recommended Family Allergy Asthma Clinic to me, the first visit was the evaluation and the second and third tests to see what I am allergic to ... and now if to perform a treatment as it should be.  His staff is excellent and cordial, very attentive to his patients and the Dr. Buddiga Praveen  is very dedicated with his work and professionalism.</text>< user>

One of the worst asthma clinics I have ever been too. Very rude and unprofessional. Hung up on my face twice when asked about my results! I DO NOT recommend this place. Every time I ask to speak with a nurse, they tell me the same thing that I’ve been told a week ago. I called a few days prior asking the same thing and was told the same thing, yet have not received a call back from anybody like I was supposed too. The receptionists and the doctors need to do their JOB.< /review>

I had a wonderful experience with Dr. Buddiga and his staff at Family Allergy. I had been struggling with hives for years and I was able to get in to see the doctor right away and figure it out. The front desk was  very kind and helpful, the nurse was also very kind and informative, and after meeting Dr. Buddiga himself I can see that whole staff is a reflection of his care for his work and his patients. I have already recommended a family member to see him as well and you are in great hands if you choose to visit his office. If I could give 6 stars I would.<//review>

The staff & Dr. Buddiga are awesome.  When you call the front desk you always get someone.  You never get an automated message asking you to push certain numbers to speak to someone.   I highly recommend Dr. Buddiga & his staff.  They all are professional, caring & friendly.<//text>

The Allergy Doctor is very helpful about my condition ever since i was sent to his clinic. The employees on the front desks were very helpful whenever i came to all of my appointments in this clinic and also making new upcoming appointments for my next visit. i hope there are others would come and take appointments to this Allergy Doctor no matter what insurance you have.</review>

What a wonderful experience for allergy testing. I must first say I hadn’t had a good experience at another popular clinic in town. Not only is his staff super sweet and professional, his bedside manor is comfortable and patient. He allows you to ask questions and genuinely tries to simplify his explanations. I will recommend this doctor and office to anyone experiencing allergy or asthma issues because of my positive experience. I hadn’t realized I was struggling with my asthma, but they did. Simple tests and no long waits. Thank Family Allergy Clinic.< /Text>

We had a great experience with our appointment. Bringing a baby in for medical care can be stressful, but the office was great. Dr. Buddiga was direct and efficient, but still courteous. He answered our questions and was focused on finding a solution for our little one. The office staff were very kind.<//Review>

I received the new patient paperwork via email, was checked in promptly when I arrived for my appointment.  I was brought back quickly, vitals were checked, and before I knew it Dr Buddiga was in for my appointment.  He listened to all my concerns, asked questions about my history and made a plan to go forward.  I appreciate feeling cared for and actually seeing a doctor that cared.

Dr.Buddiga has diagnosed my son correctly and is extremely thorough in his work up , I have been to many allergists locally and my son has not been evaluated by a physician - what I  mean to say is on their first evaluation of my son's condition they are evaluated by the doctor's physician assistants or NP's even when the pediatrician requests an Asthma consultation from an Asthma specialist .
High recommendation for this doctor who has a great reception & medical assistant staff who are happy to be there.
I have been to many doctors for my own care over the years but the welcoming atmosphere and team work that I have observed is definitely a plus - especially in these times of COVID19.<//Text>

I cannot say enough good things about Dr. Buddiga. My daughter has severe food allergies and had a scary weekend. Today, of course on the holiday, he spoke with me through his exchange (many doctors do not even have an exchange anymore, requiring patients to call 911 and follow up with them on the next business day), then he followed up with me several times by phone directly to make sure that my daughter had a course of treatment and would be OK before his office even reopens tomorrow. He will check her in person tomorrow before school starts. Who does that? In my daughter's case, he gave me all of options and explained everything in great detail. I am so deeply grateful for his expertise and all of the time and personal attention that he gives his patients. Truly an extraordinary doctor. Highly recommended.</Text>

The nurse called me to the back, took my vitals and explained what she was in going to do. I  appreciated her communication and the promptness of the doctor. He had a pleasant mannerism that made me feel comfortable and important. Usually, a doctor will try to come in and rush out. However, I feel like he listened and did his best to tent to my problem. I would recommend this clinic to others who suffer from allergies. I never knew what I was allergic to until now. Before, I constantly itched....</review>< pictures>

Dr. Buddiga and his staff are very friendly and accommodating. I had a severe allergic reaction and was able to book an appointment that same day. Dr. Buddiga has great bedside manner -- he took the time to listen to my concerns and addressed them well. During my visit, I also took an allergy test that took about 20 minutes. I was given my results on the spot.
Overall, I was very impressed with the doctor and his staff. 10/10 would recommend.<//Review>

Today's visit was for the1st allergy shot of many to come. The Doctor not only administered the injections,  but went out of his way to explain the process as it relates to my overall health goals. He was quite affable and more than willing to share the biochemical processes involved in the allergy injection treatment regimen I have begun.
The staff are top notch. Efficient and personable. This place is being run by folks who care.<//text>

Dr. Buddiga is an exception doctor! About 2 years ago I started seeing him when my primary doctor could not longer help me with the symptoms I was having (coughing and inflammation of lungs  due to allergies). Nonetheless I came to his office after reading his review online and they couldn’t have been farther from the truth. Dr. Buddiga’s staff greeted me and he listened to my concerns very closely. About a week later I saw a change in my health and my cough eventually went away. I would HIGHLY recommend him!<//Text>

My husband and I just got vaccinated with Dr Buddiga. We received the Pfizer vaccine but I think he has both types. The office is very professional and friendly. It was nice to be able to ask the Dr questions and he administered the shot himself. Completely painless and relaxed. I felt safe and well cared for! The staff are amazing and helpful. Overall a great experience.< /review>

I love going to Family Allergy Asthma Clinic. Everyone there treats you like a cherished friend. If you are having a problem they WANT to help you feel better! Lisa has a cheery hello and bright smile 24/7. Dr. Buddiga has a wealth of knowledge as well as a sincere desire to serve all his patients to the best of his abilities. This doctor has gone the extra mile for myself and my family. Having to get 2 shots every week for a year might seem overwhelming , but not if Jen is giving the injections. She always takes the time to make it as painless as possible. Thank you Family Allergy. I feel lucky to have found you.< /text>

Dr Buddiga was awesome. Found Family Allergy Asthma Clinic by Google. Front desk staff was great. I called in the morning and by four that afternoon I was on the road to recovery and no more itching. I had a severe rash and breathing problem that started the day after Christmas. My general practitioner had attempted treatment. Thank You Valley Allergy Asthma Clinic for helping me breathe better and no itching.< /Text>

I’ve been seeing Dr. Buddiga for about one year now and I’m so glad my primary care dr referred me to Family Allergy and Asthma! Dr Buddiga is very knowledgeable and knows how to share that sometimes complex medical knowledge in a way I can understand. He has helped me understand the reasons behind why I get asthma/allergy flare-ups which then helps me manage my own health more effectively. He listens patiently and never makes me feel rushed during appts. He is also very personable and does not have a heavy accent which makes communication easy. I respect him immensely and continue to e grateful for his expertise and help, it has made a difference in improving my health.

Lastly, the office staff are very helpful - prompt to answer the phone, explain billing, offer scheduling options, return phone calls, etc. Whether in person or on the phone, I never feel like I’m a bother but rather valued and respected. In general, Family Allergy Asthma offers professional and compassionate healthcare; a unique and rare combination. Give them a call, you won’t regret it!!</Text>

I was referred to Family Allergy Asthma clinic by my primary doctor after having a negative experience at another very well-known allergy office .  I must say that Dr Buddiga is wonderful.  He listens to what you have to say, and explains his treatment plan using words that are easy to understand. His staff are friendly and efficient.    I am very thankful to have finally found my allergy specialist.< /Review>

I am so glad I went to Family Allergy Asthma Clinic. The staff are very nice. Dr. Buddiga is very nice and a knowledgeable person. I have had a bad reaction to multiple antibiotics in the past and the doctors no longer knew how to treat me medically. I went to see Dr. Buddiga, he ran some tests and found out that I am not in fact allergic to the medications. Thankfully, I am now able to get the treatment I need.</text>

Dr. Buddiga and his staff provide excellent medical care and genuinely care about their patients.   Dr. Buddiga makes a point to thoroughly explain his treatment plan and welcomes any questions or concerns.  There has been little to no wait time for appointments and their allergy shot schedule is very convenient. If you or your family suffer from asthma or allergies this is the place to go.</Review>

I’ve struggled with allergies my entire life and have tried many different allergy doctors in the Fresno/Clovis area in the passed 10+ years, but Family Allergy Asthma Clinic has been the best fit for me. Dr. Buddiga is very thorough and takes time to listen and respond to all your questions and concerns. There’s rarely ever a long wait to be seen by the doctor or get your allergy shot. The staff is also very friendly and the office is always kept nice and clean. I highly recommend this place for all your allergy/asthma needs!</text>

Dr. Buddiga is nothing short of amazing. He has a reassuring presence, which is very calming. He takes his time to explain everything thoroughly to ensure there is a full understanding of what is going on and what can be expected. Not once during any of my visits did I ever feel rushed by the doctor or any of his staff. The wait times have consistently been short and the staff is always friendly. Fresno is lucky to have to have Dr. Buddiga and his team as part of the community.< /Text>

Family Allergy Asthma Clinic is the most friendly and helpful office I have been to in years!  Dr. Buddiga, himself, is a very caring man, and the staff are always polite and respectful. Dr. Buddiga takes his time in the room to truly understand your needs, and does not make you feel like he is in a rush when you ask questions. His office is one of the very few in Fresno that really make you feel welcome, and like they honestly care about their patients. I would highly recommend Family Allergy Asthma Clinic to family, friends, and anyone looking to find an office that cares about the health of their patients. I would give 10 stars if I could.<//text>

Dr. Buddiga is amazing with my 6.5 yr old son. We came from another specialist who worked well with our son and he closed his practice and went with Baz. However, we weren’t able to stay with him, we were sent by our insurance to another provider with Baz. I was definitely not satisfied so I stopped taking my son until I could find another Specialist. That’s when our insurance sent us here! He has been very easy going and kind to my son, his staff is also always very welcoming. They’re very personable as well. Extremely satisfied and have already been telling family and friends to come here if they’re looking for an allergy specialist.<//review>

I have many allergies, and I thought that if I scheduled an appointment with a specialist, he or she could help find a solution to control my allergies, I went in last week for my appointment I was seen, I took the test and I only came out positive for two things on the list of 80, and I know for a fact that I’m allergic to more that half on that list, I also know this because I’ve gotten blood drawn, proving that I am allergic to the things that came out negative in the allergy test that I took here. The Doctor seemed a bit uninterested in my case and heard a discussion outside with the nurse prior to the test saying that they were not going to be able to run a test for me. It makes me think as if he had made that decision at first with the nurse maybe because I’m a CalViva patient. I didn’t feel taken seriously, and to me this is serious because when the spring comes along, it gets to the point where the allergy’s are so bad that you just want to stop breathing. Aside from me not being able to eat healthy, because I suddenly became allergic to fruits and vegetables.
I am editing this post as well because the doctor in a way made me review his page and watched me review it.< /Text>

<text>These people are wonderful! From the Doctor himself to the staff, everyone is so welcoming and personable. When I first came I was dealing with allergic reactions left and right, I had been to a plethora of doctors and none had been able to end the reactions. One visit here and Dr. Budiga immediately told me what was wrong and how we would fix it.
I come weekly now for allergy shots, and thoroughly enjoy the friendly disposition of receptionists and how much better I feel.</text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<Text>Nothing but positive things to say. This dude is AWESOME.

I specifically requested a referral to Dr. Buddiga because I'd read about his research and activism regarding pollution in the Central Valley and how it impacts the people who live here. He seemed like a doctor who truly cares about his patients, so I asked to see him before anyone else. Unlike most quality doctors in this town, he accepts my low-income insurance, and I was approved much more quickly than most specialist referrals. They called me and offered an appointment within less than a week of the phone call!

Office staff is very friendly, helpful, and fast. Very efficient and up-to-date. Dr. Buddiga is kind and patient, will answer all of your questions, and respects your time. He'll listen to whatever you have to say and proceed with whatever works for you as an individual.

My first appointment was quick, I was seen immediately and within minutes I was given a food allergy test. When the results were all negative he ordered blood work, and offered me an environmental allergy test just a week later. When I got that test, I lit up like a Christmas tree. He discussed with me the option of immunotherapy shots, fully transparent about the commitment it requires, and said we'd only proceed once I was ready. In the meantime he told me which OTC allergy meds would best supplement my current treatment. He scheduled an appointment in a few months, and said to call and make one sooner if I was ready before then.

I've had a lot of horrible experiences with doctors in this town, especially suffering from chronic illnesses and low income. Dr. Buddiga is every exception. I've already recommended him to several people and will continue to do so. I look forward to working with him in the future. You know a doctor is special when you actually get excited about your appointments!<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>{'time': 1570753176192, 'text': 'Appreciate your detailed and strongest recommendation.\nI do my best to give back to patients health and well-being for which I have trained for nights and days like any physician.

Amazing Doctor! He's patient, kind, and accommodation. After having ongoing gastro issues I decided to see an allergist.  After testing was completed he thoroughly explained my allergies and came up with a plan and followed up with me to see how things were going. He truly cares and takes the time to sit with you. Not only that, he referred me to another doctor for a different issues that my PCP did not catch.  Amazing doctor!</Text>

My Dermatologist referred me to Dr. Buddiga,a popular highly regarded Allergist, in town.
I had never been to an Allergist before,and I was unsure as to what would happen. I called and was able to get an appointment in a very timely manner.The friendly staff,was welcoming and accommodating and worked with me to find a date/time that met my schedule.
Dr. Buddiga,gave me plenty of time at the appointment.
He listened carefully as I answered his questions about my condition. He clearly explained the plan for testing and answered all my questions,never rushing me.
It was a pleasure to be in the caring environment of this office,with such attentive staff !
From the friendly front desk staff,Susie and Dale, to Denise, his assistant and finally to Dr Buddiga- himself.
It was an excellent experience all round.
I highly recommend this physician to any friends and family.<//review>

My teenage son had an asthma attack this morning and Dr.Buddiga so was helpful that he opened his office to treat him after I called him -not knowing what to do and in a state of panic . He gave him 2 breathing treatments in the office and prescribed him meds - he is doing much better this afternoon. The doctor even called up a few hours later to follow up, Thank you Dr.Buddiga for saving and helping him ! I just wish they were more doctors like you in Fresno</Text>

<pics>None</pics><text>My Dermatologist referred me to Dr. Buddiga,a popular highly regarded Allergist, in town.
I had never been to an Allergist before,and I was unsure as to what would happen. I called and was able to get an appointment in a very timely manner.The friendly staff,was welcoming and accommodating and worked with me to find a date/time that met my schedule.
Dr. Buddiga,gave me plenty of time at the appointment.
He listened carefully as I answered his questions about my condition. He clearly explained the plan for testing and answered all my questions,never rushing me.
It was a pleasure to be in the caring environment of this office,with such attentive staff !
From the friendly front desk staff,Susie and Dale, to Denise, his assistant and finally to Dr Buddiga- himself.
It was an excellent experience all round.
I highly recommend this physician to any friends and family.< /text>< user_id>

My teenage son had an asthma attack this morning and Dr.Buddiga so was helpful that he opened his office to treat him after I called him -not knowing what to do and in a state of panic . He gave him 2 breathing treatments in the office and prescribed him meds - he is doing much better this afternoon. The doctor even called up a few hours later to follow up, Thank you Dr.Buddiga for saving and helping him ! I just wish they were more doctors like you in Fresno<//Review>

I highly recommend The Family Allergy and Asthma Clinic to anyone who is looking for an allergist. Dr. Buddiga is an amazing doctor who truly cares about the health of his patients. Not only has Dr. Buddiga helped to diagnose and treat my allergies, but has also shown an honest concern about other health issues I have faced during my time as a patient at his office. Also, the entire staff at this office go out of their way to make their patients feel comfortable and welcome during each and every visit. I cannot say enough good things about this business!</Review>

I found Family Allergy Asthma Clinic through Google. I read the reviews and decided this would be the place for me. :)  The reviews were so right! The receptionists at the front desk are super friendly and make you feel comfortable right away. Dr. Buddiga is so thorough, so nice and makes you feel comfortable as well. I look forward to getting my allergy shots! Who would have thought? Lol
If you have allergies or think you have asthma, this is the place to come.<//Text>

< Review>
This clinic is my sanctuary during the busy work week. Dr. Buddiga and his kind staff are so wonderful and on-point. The clinic itself is very modern and streamlined. Most importantly- I’m much healthier now that I’ve identified my allergies and am receiving weekly shots. My immune system is much stronger and I’ve avoided getting sick during this terrible winter season of circulating illness, despite my frequent plane travel which usually does me in! Thank you!<//Review>

I found Dr. Buddiga through my primary care provider.  From the moment I entered the office I was welcomed.  The front office staff is pleasant and caring.  The back office staff are the same.  Dr. Buddiga is very knowledgeable, caring, honest and thorough.  He took my entire medical history into account.  He spent time with me and answered all my questions.  I have never felt hurried through an appointment.  So very grateful to have found this remarkable provider and his office.< /Review>

I feel like I've suffered from seasonal allergies all my life. This is the self-diagnosed opinion I’m led to believe based on the countless allergy medication commercials I’ve seen. Sadly, as I write this review, I realize that I truly “suffered” most of my time here in Fresno. I’ve suffered from the semi-annual sinus infections, suffered from mind-numbing head congestion, suffered from compromised immunity leading to regular cough/cold/flus, and suffered from not really knowing if latest over the counter med is the one I should be taking.
My allergies always come and go. I knew I would eventually get better and figured I could manage the symptoms as needed.  Finally, I had enough when I couldn’t “manage” things anymore.  I heard good things about Dr. Buddiga and took a chance to see if I could be seen at the clinic as a new patient. I was pleasantly surprised that they could see me the same day which they said was not typical. They emailed me my new patient paperwork which saved me (and presumably them) all that time getting to the clinic early.
The office is super convenient to get to being just off Chestnut and Herndon. At the clinic, I didn’t have to wait any time at all before going inside and having my vitals checked. A minute later, Dr. Buddiga came in and saw me which was unexpected since I usually have to wait seemingly forever before seeing most doctors.  I was pleased to get a thorough workup including the scratch test.  Dr. Buddiga and the clinic staff were very pleasant and I didn’t feel rushed or ever having to wait forever between procedures or reviewing the results with the doctor.
I’m very happy to be treated at the Family Allergy Asthma Clinic.  Of course, I still have to see what happens with my allergies but at least I have a solid treatment plan now.  My only regret is that I waited so long to come in.<//Text>

I have referred many friends and family who are experiencing allergy and respiratory problems to this office.  Living in the Central Valley, at one time or another, we are going to have allergy issues; it's good to  have such an experienced, pleasant allergist available.</Review>< pics>

Family Allergy Clinic on Herndon and Chestnut is a wonderful answer to my lifelong chronic allergies. Dr. Buddiga is extremely knowledgable, professional, and caring. The staff is very friendly and help you feel welcomed and comfortable. They have a have a very efficient, clean, welcoming office. I have suffered with allergies all of my life. Why have I not done this sooner?! Dr. Buddiga is a comfortable and caring doctor who helps
Patients like me to heal my allergies. I am so grateful that I took this long overdue step to see this Allergy Specialist. I drive from Tulare for this appointment. I highly recommend adults grandparents or children to seek professional treatment and begin healing from allergies. I feel very confident and happy to be a patient here with Dr. Buddiga at Family Allergy Clinic in Fresno. I highly recommend this  physician and his practice, Susan Warren< /Review>

<rate>5<//rate><text>I have experienced allergy issues since the early 1980's and have seen a variety of doctors over the years. My symptoms have ranged from severe sinus inflammation, sinus infections, bronchitis, to asthma. I have been over treated, meaning I have been given too much medication, that negatively effected my daily routine and other doctors have been too conservative where my symptoms improved little. I was sufficiently frustrated at one point where I gave up on doctors and went solely  with homeopathic treatments. During the past two years my symptoms became persistent and I was unable to find relief.  Last year, in October,  I was referred by my new primary care physician to Dr. Buddiga and have been extremely pleased with his thoroughness, his approach and the results! I feel better than I have in the past 10 years.  His bed side manner is great. He is friendly and approachable and his office staff is great. I can highly recommend a visit to Dr. Buddiga.< /text>< Pics>

<Text>My youngest daughter has struggled with asthma; especially,here in the valley (plume in the air at times is when my daughter has the toughest hardship).  Thanks to Family Allergy, my daughter's health condition improved.  She  is interested in sport in her middle school.  With no hesitation, I recommend Dr. Praveen Buddiga.

My wife and I have seen huge improvements in our daughter's respiratory abilities during challenging poor air for sensitive groups.  This April 2019, Izel  will complete a year of treatment and keeps depending less of specific medical intervention.  She doesn't allow health issues hinder sports decisions.< /Text>< pics>

If you have struggled with asthma and allergies I can't stress it enough to call and make an appointment with this amazing specialist.  Read on for my experience: I have struggled with asthma and allergies since I was a kid.  I have seen specialist before and have received little help so I wasnt sure anyone could help me.  After a visit to the ER I looked for another specialist to try again. Fro. My first phone call the office staff was warm welcoming and got me right in.  When I met Dr. Buddiga he was so easy to talk to and with so many years of experienced knowledge and the research he has done.  He was the first doctor that actually was able to answer questions I have had for years, and noone else was able to explain them to me so I could understand it.  Also he was the first doctor that ever ordered blood work in 30+ years of having these issues. He put together a plan to get the asthma under control, because breathing is important, and then we will move on to the allergies.  For the first time in a very long time that I am hopeful that I can get this under control because I am a very physically active person and asthma creates a lot of struggle for me to overcome.  But I truly look forward to getting my life back and being healthier.  Thanks to Dr. Buddiga and his great office staff.<//text></record>

I absolutely am very grateful And thrilled with the type of service you receive from Dr. Buddiga and staff at Family Allergy and Asthma Clinic.  My daughter and son have been suffering with allergy, asthma and eczema symptoms for years.   They have seen different specialist and other allergist And still did not  Make any progress. Finally my pediatrician referred me to Dr. Buddiga.  And it's been the best thing that's ever happened for my children!!  Doctor  Is very knowledgeable in his field And takes his time to explain conditions and the different method of  Treatments, why they're necessary, how they work and what type of end result you will be looking at.   My only regret is that I wish I would have known of him sooner!  It is a little disheartening and frustrating to know that the issues my children have been struggling with could have been resolved years of go. But the silver lining is knowing that now they are in the care of Dr. Buddiga and everyone at Family Allergy and Asthma we are on the right path of treatment and resolution!! Thank you to Family Allergy and Asthma.......<//Text>

<review>I can not say enough great things about Dr. Buddiga and his staff! I have Celiac Disease and multiple food, environmental and prescription allergies. Dr.Buddiga always addresses any changes or concerns with my health. He is exceptionally knowledgeable and explains everything in a way that I understand and I never feel rushed .  Dr.Buddiga and his staff are always happy and my appointments have always been on time or early! For the first time in my life, I finally have found an allergist that has helped me  stop suffering! Thank you, for everything you and your staff do.

< Review>
Dr. Buddiga is patient, kind and a truly exceptional allergist.  He is a great doctor that understands how diagnoses translate into everyday life. Our littles have severe food allergies. We have been to allergists in San Diego, then again at Choc in Orange County before coming to Dr. Buddiga here in Fresno. We are so happy to have found this office.  I think his personal experience with allergies is what sets him apart and makes him truly outstanding.  I have a background in research, am incredibly picky and have very high expectations from medical professionals, and especially for those caring for my children. Dr. Buddiga far exceeds my expectations in the very best of ways. The office is also beautiful and easy to access. Very minimal wait time. The office staff is very friendly too.</Review>

Dr. Praveen Buddiga is an awesome doctor. My 9 year old son who has autism, ADHD & has other disabilities is wonderful with him. I recommend this doctor to anyone who has really bad allergies. I give Dr. Praveen Buddiga 5 stars! :)< /Review>

Sadly, I have chronic sinus infections. The only MD ever who has dramatically helped me with incredible patient care is Dr. Budigga. For example, one time I was experiencing a high level of symptoms. It was Saturday morning on a holiday weekend. Dr. Budigga's answering service took my call, put me on hold and within minutes I was talking with Dr. Budigga. He left his activities and opened his office to see me. He prescribe appropriate Rx and I was on my way to healing before noon on that holiday weekend Saturday. He is the best, most up-to-date, most conscientious, most well-trained allergist/asthma expert in the Valley!<//text>

<Time>1517942273397<//Time><text>I have suffered with asthma for 41 years as a child I went to various physicians of multiple disciplines from pediatric to allergist, but never was I under constant care or control and most of all I really didn’t understand  my illness until I seen Dr Buddiga. He put my asthma under control he educated me about my illness and put me under a regiment of medications. He stated when he first seen me I was moving very little air in my lungs. I have my good days and I have my bad days but I have more good days now, and he is able to see the improvement in my lung capacity. If it wasn’t for Dr Buddiga my quality of life due to my asthma would not have improved and I honestly believe that I wouldn’t be alive today. He actually cares for his patients and it is difficult to find a Dr that actually cares for his patients.< /text></record></dataset><record>

I've had the pleasure of knowing Doctor Buddiga for some years now. Ive seen him at another office that he use to work at.  In my experience with him is that he takes time with his patients, he is concerned about your health issues and make sure he adresses them. He is up close and personal. Almost a person you can call a friend because he is so down to earth and professional at the same time. I had not seen him for some years, but when I seen him on a Tv commercial  I immediately picked up the phone and made an appointment, and I'm glad I did.  The Office staff is very kind, and the enviorment is very clean.and professional also. No long waiting time to see the Doctor.<//text>

My first experience at Dr. Buddigas office was a positive one. The office was beautiful, modern and clean. The staff was warm, helpful and efficient.
I was called back to see Dr. Buddiga shortly after I arrived. Dr. Buddiga was kind, knowledgeable, and informative. I feel that Dr. Praveen Buddiga genuinely cares for his patients well being.

After not seeing an Allergist for over 5 years, finding Dr. Budigga was a a pleasant discovery. His staff was so accommodating, and made my appointment within a day. Dr. Budigga spent time with me discussing my problem and actually “listened” to his patient. I’m so glad to have found him!< /text>

It’s very hard to find and keep good doctors in the Fresno Area in part due to the lower rate insurance companies reimburse doctors in this area.  When I learned I could google a message to let others know about Dr. Buddiga and his office, Family Allergy and Asthma Clinic, I was glad to share.

Dr.Buddiga is a good listener.  I know this as I have asked him many questions during my appointments.  If you are looking for a good doctor who knows first hand the struggles of those who have allergies, asthma, sinus problems or are in need of immunotherapy, Dr. Buddiga understands and can help patients on their pathway to improved health.
Good doctor
Good staff
Clean office
Good location

<Text>The staff at Family Allergy Clinic are very professional yet caring. All members of my family go here, and it's nice to finally have answers to the questions we have regarding our allergy and asthma symptoms. Dr. Buddiga is great with children. He's seen my daughter since she was about 3 months old, helping determine lactose problems, allergy screening, and asthma concerns. When she turns two, we will be returning to Dr. Buddiga for a screening of possible food allergies. He even knows how to handle explaining things to my stubborn husband, who does not like to go to the doctor, but will go to see Dr. Buddiga and get treated for his ever troubling sinus issues. Overall, this is a great family allergy and asthma clinic, where you get the care you need, and it's comfortable and clean. I hope you give Dr. Buddiga and his staff a chance to care for your family as I have.
