<user>113990236588631905791<//user><text>I am a hobby Yorkshire Terrier breeder. I have brought my dogs here for their shots, and teeth cleaning. The wait can be insanely long sometimes. Even to drop your dog off, with an appointment (teeth cleaning) I had to wait almost 2 hours.
I also had my kitten neutered here. They did a good job, but even though they called me to pick up I still had to wait an hour and a half.
I feel like Dr. Sam was very good. Most of the staff is nice.
But they need to higher a person for just the front desk, to answer phones and take payments. They get really backed up. And it would alleviate stress on the nurses. Plus the nurses wouldn't get so behind.
I took 1 star off because of a couple of the crazy waits.
But I have recommended this hospital to several people, because they make pet care affordable.  And that is a wonderful thing.<//text><GmapID>0x80c2d5bcca950483:0x5c47b713f43ff405</GmapID><Pictures>None</Pictures>< rate>

<Review>Used to be real nice, been going there for 20 years. But the vet has become so busy that it seems they have decided to go for quantity over quality. Took the dog in for surgery and only got to talk to the vet once on intake day, never got to talk to the vet again post surgery. Only were able to deal with assistants after that, and there were mistake after mistake from them. I even had to ask them for the antibiotic because they had forgotten about that. Looking for a new vet now.</Review><response>None<//response>< UserId.>

<Date>1617292217883< /Date><Rating>1</Rating><review>This is by far the worst animal hospital I have ever been to. I came in at 12pm because my puppy had contracted parvo and was told I had to wait until the people in front of me went in for vaccines. So those people got attended and so did another group of people, long story short, I didn't get attended until 6pm even though my puppy was dying right in front of them. had me waiting till 8pm in the room just to tell me she needed to stay because they were closing and just brought me the bill. At that point since they denied treatment all day I wasn't sure I can trust them with my puppy all night.  I ended up leaving until 10 pm I was the last one out of there. they also refused to prescribe me with any medicine. If only I would have taken my puppy else where, I think she'd still be here with us.</review>< pics>

<Rate>1</Rate><Review>This animal hospital is by far the the most unprofessional I have ever dealt with. The girl that answered the phone was extremely rude, and literally, huffed & puffed as I was asking for some information. I should have payed more attention to previous reviews of this place, but I do like to see things for myself because maybe I might just have a great experience compared to others. But nope. I had to deal with someone incompetent of doing her job. For the staff at this clinic, you know who you are, it's a shame treating people/pets the way you do. You are the front lines of the animal world. If you don't like what you do, find something else! You deal with the public and their pets for God's sake! Do your job and help these poor animals that need help! I honestly do not know how this place is still in business. Hopefully they can find a better caring, professional, and respectful staff. Luckily I found a great animal hospital that gladly took us in.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

<Text>Not only was my dog attacked here but they did not treat his wound properly, never told me (I had to find out by myself seeing his open wound) and it got infected. The main “doctor” never got back to me and is very unprofessional. I could make a whole list as to what they’re doing wrong but Please never bring your dog here, I love my dog very much and these people here don’t care about your pet they just want your money< /Text>< Rating>

<review>Took my 2 months old puppy to Colima animal hospital for severe diarrhea, doctor gave her a test for parvovirus and it came back negative, doctor walks back in and says he’s giving her some shots, I said okay thinking he’s a veterinarian she’ll be fine, Doctor never diagnosed her, NEVER told me what was wrong with her just gave me some meds and gave her the shots and told me to give the medicine to her the next day.
I Wake up next morning and my beautiful 2 month of puppy has passed away.

I call Colima pet hospital and ask them for my puppies medical record and they put me on hold for 30 min until I had to hang up knowing they were never going to pick up my call again, I called 2 more times, same problem they put me on hold.
I never got her medical records, I never got a call back from Colima pet hospital.<//review>< Date>

Nice and friendly staff. This is the go to spot for people with bully breeds especially Frenchies and English bulldogs. They took excellent care of my dog when she had an ear infection and they also expertly did her c-section. They still crop ears here as well.
Its first come first served so get here early as they tend to get super crowded on Saturdays. They make healthcare affordable for you and I think this is why it is the go to spot for all of your animal care needs.</text>

<text>We took are 3 Min Pins to Colima animal hospital on Feb 10th to have their teeth cleaned. What a mistake that was... they released my dogs while they were still under the influence of  anesthesia and at times I had a hard time getting them to wake up. We also updated all their shots and while looking at the paperwork notice that they used  outdate rabies vaccine shots. We confronted them about this issue over the outdated vaccine. They said it was a mistake on our paperwork and not to worry about it? They said if anybody has issues with this over they could just call Colima Animal hospital... they refused to correct our paperwork to show that all vaccines were up to date. Never again will I take my dogs to Colima... a simple thing to correct and they refused to do the right thing. Wow!</text>< Pics>

<Text>Our kitten was taken to this location by the rescue owner of "Sweet Pawz and Meows".
He was to be microchipped, neutered and get a rabies shot.
Our kitten was released in poor condition which implied that the staff at this vet are negligent.
Our kitten was soaked in his own urine and had a bloody/torn nail. We were told by the rescue owner who organized this visit, that our kitten was left in his carrier unattended for too long which is why he urinated on himself and must had been scratching in the carrier to get out or seek help. :-(
Not only was the experience traumatic for our kitten and ourselves but we never got a straight answer/correct information from the front desk.
We have called the office multiple times to speak with Trish, Monique or any of the receptionists.. we were told that they were 1) understaffed, 2) they do not permit appointments only walk ins and 3) they couldn't even inform us of our kittens check in/release time nor any info about the procedures done. They were also VERY RUDE, unhelpful & unorganized!
We are appalled that our sweet and beautiful boy could be so mistreated and that there is no sympathy, no apologies, nor attempt to rectify the situation or his wounds.
***We strongly advise those considering to take your pet here to beware and urge you to consider elsewhere.***</Text></record></dataset><record>

Don't take your English bulldogs here or better yet your any of your dogs.. they keep them caged up in the back and never do the c section in time for them to deliver your healthy litter instead you get a dead mum with all her pups dead in her!!</text>

Waited almost 5 hours just for my dog to be seen. Poor customer service and one of the workers there was very rude. That was enough to change my mind. I Take my word it’s not worth the wait. It was a horrible experience.</text>

Horrible! Signed in at 4pm.  Then it hit 6;57 pm and i still haven't been called. Everyone who signed after me is already being called. Told the receptionist up front the situation and they told me TWICE that i was next and 30 mins later everyone is still going ahead of me. A guy with his puppy just signed in and they took him right away saying hes next now so they'll see him. I have 2 kids who are hungry and still have homework to do. So ridiculous just for vaccines!!!!</review>

My 2 year old bulldog GiGi died February 2021 in Colima vet hospital due to neglect. She was admitted for an emergency c-section at 10am due to having a 102.9 fever and vomiting. She was already due to have her puppys as well. She was left in the kennel unattended and they never prioritized my dog as dr. Samir nous stated that he would because of her high fever. Not knowing how long she was left unattended a staff member noticed that she had collapsed. They soon called the Dr. He never tried to resuscitate my dog. He then made the " executive " decision as he called it to open her up to remove the puppies.

I never received a call as to how she was doing. At around 1pm i had to call. It took 25 min and about to hung up phone calls to finally reach the dr. He then tells me I'm sorry your dog died in the kennel. I was extremely devastated.. How could this happen! She was scheduled for an emergency c-section and dr. Samir nous guaranteed me that she would be up for surgery asap but instead left in a kennel to die..God knows and I feel it in my heart that this place neglected her. 1 hour after my puppies were born (so they said) they decided to tell me to come and pick up my puppies because they had no mom to feed off of.. why did they not call me to update me on the status of my dog that died in there care. How long had she been dead. She was dropped off at 10am and I was given the info nearly around 1pm that she passed. What really happened and why?All I know that is that my poor gigi was neglected!!! As soon as my puppies were born they waited a whole hour to tell me to pick them up and again I was only told because I initiated the call...

This place needs to be shut down.

I pray that know one else has to experience a  tragic loss just the way I did. Do not continue to bring your animals to Colima. There un- professional, un -organized and very neglectful.</Text>

Back in july i took our frenchie there because he had severe diarrhea and ended up staying there for 5 days. He had no other symptoms so my first thought is salmonella since he did eat cooked chicken before. Turns out he had nothing wrong, no infection nor bacteria ( which made no sense). At pick up i was given antibiotics incase he did have something and that seemed to have been working for him there i guess ( still not making sense). So on my way to the car he coughs and im like "okay" this better not be kennel cough because he didn't have it before". I get home and he's coughing more and i wait a day or two before i call the clinic to make sure it's not a dry throat. They prescribe clavamox and temaril over the phone. So im thinking ok this should work since it just started. I notice neither meds is working but i wait to finish the temaril since it helps open the airways. Let me say i have always worked as a vet tech since i was 17 and stopped about 5-6 yrs ago cuz i had to raise my son. And i know if the meds aren't working its because its beyond just a cough now. I take him back and i tell them i recieved him back sicker, turns out it was a respiratory infection almost turning into broncolitis. Both lungs and heart were inflamed. I was upset because kennel cough is the cause for this and kennel cough is airborne. Meaning the dog who had it wasn't isolated from other dogs or the clinic lacks in sanitizing the exam rooms. I mentioned it to the doc and was given a discount. And to top it off his cough lasted 2 months.
This shouldn't have gone unnoticed, when you are in treatment medicating and observing the pets that stay over night your job is to mention it on the file but it wasn't. This is very irresponsible that means this place isn't being run correctly. Every vet i have ever worked at has one big rule which is " always clean the exam room before and after" and sanitize the floors often and that's something colima does not do. My heart sanked because i know breeders who have gone to colima and had their pups died from a bad respiratory infection.  But we had not experienced it yet up until that day. I understand you techs at colima are busy but a way to make it easier and smoother for everyone is to do what's easy first.
Vaccines, deworming, and progesterone test should be seen first. You don't need to take them to the back or to a room, it can be done in the car or up front. Medication, drop off and pick up can be done by two or 3 girls. And last should be the dogs waiting for an exam. This way things are out of the way and so are people.< /Review>

Okay I'm going be 100% honest about this Animal Clinic and not sugar code anything. I'm from Orange County and by far this is the best place to bring my dogs because 90% of animal clinic in OC you need to book an appointment at least a week or two in advance. Secondly, Colima got the best prices for progesterones or anything that has to do with breeding like surgicals, AIs, or C sections. Thirdly, they have the best prices compared to other clinics by far. One of the nurses Amber was very informative and kind at the front desk I really appreciated her help! I see a lot of ppl complaining about the wait time on here but ppl should be thankful that you don't need an appointment and wont have to wind up paying $1,000s for an emergency like other animal clinics. The only real complaint I have is sometimes the nurses leave you on hold so you have to hang up and call back. But besides that thanks Colima Animal Hospital for the great work!👍</Text>

DO NOT GO TO THIS VET IF YOUR PET HAS AN URGENT MEDICAL CONDITION.

This vet appears to primarily serve the birthing of french bulldog puppies -- if your pet needs medical attention, like my cat did, DO NOT COME HERE.
In addition to their general rude attitude, long waits, and disorganization, which would be ordinarily excusable if the medical service was effective... It is not effective nor a good place to get medical services for your pet.

They botched my cat's surgery which should have been a simple operation. He is now going onto his 2nd month of recovery from what should have been a 2-week operation.
The staff was completely clueless when it came to what we needed to do at home, they didn't provide us with a cone or medication, leaving us to do the guesswork and Google what needs to be done post-operation.

Your pets deserve better!</Text>< Resp>

We had a very poor experience at this vet from 9/27/2020 to 9/28/2020. We adopted a puppy from a local rescue, and this was the rescue's choice for spay. We were told to show up early and got to the vet at 7am, we didn't leave until 9 am because of the process and the amount of dogs. We were expecting to pick up our dog that night. We called to check up on her several times, but were told they hadn't started yet and to call back again. We called at 8:30 (they close at 7) and were told they still hadn't started the spay! We asked if we could take our dog home for the night and bring her back the next morning, and we told her they were going to fix her that night and she'd be ready at 11am the next day. Big surprise! Our dog was not ready at 11am, like promised. We called them again around 3 and was told she still was not spayed. We even called the rescue and they agreed that this was unprofessional. The vet couldn't even tell the rescue an approximate time of surgery. The vet's excuse was that if emergencies came in they had to attend to them frist. Don't get me wrong, I do agree emergencies have some priority, but in our case our dog had already been with them for more that 30 hours, she needed to be the priority. At this point we were driving to the vet to pick her up regardless, because we were no longer confident in this vet. Due to traffic and the fact we were coming from Long Beach, we picked her up at 5, and she had suddenly been spayed. Finally.

Our dog sat in this vet's care for over 30 hours for a simple spay. She was not allowed to eat the night before and because they kept intending to do the surgery that day/night she was not allowed to eat or drink for over 40 hours. The employees there did not even apologize or acknowledge they they took so long to do the procedure.

The other reviews about this vet being involved with many bully breeders is true, when we picked up our dog, there were several bullies waiting for c-sections. While I was waiting to get our puppy the staff was also very rude to the other people waiting to be seen.

Unless you're a bully breeder, I would go elsewhere.< /Text>

i’ve had a few red flags here that i should have stopped going here sooner but i didn’t know of any other bulldog vets. one of them was putting my dog under anesthesia to clean his ears without my knowledge(i was furious) they even tried to charge us he’s very cooperative when his ears need to be cleaned and has never had to be put under by any other vets. another was not being able to find my dog when i called the morning after his surgery to check in on him after being on the phone for the 20-30 minute drive there they told me how he was we took him home that day. and another one was bringing in our dog because he was showing signs of ivdd and we told the dr that’s what we’re 99% sure on he said no he’s fine and a month later he was paralyzed. he’s since recovered by crate rest and physical therapy. i’m upset that we trusted this vet because we thought it was the best we could get but lucky nothing worse happened. staff DOES NOT sanitize they have empty hand sanitizer out and no soap in the restrooms they don’t enforce staying in your car to wait it’s packed way past capacity at all times.</Text>

If I could give them zero stars I would, they kept calling me to let me know my dog was ready for pick up. They didnt give me a price. They told me to reference Chewy.com go get prices. They would not provide a price. After I found out to the price I was shocked. I showed up and i had to wait over 2 hours to pay and pick up.< /text>

This place is very affordable which I don’t mind my 25 minute drive. Prepare to be there for a couple hours as they are always super busy and it’s on a first come first serve bases. As an office manager with experience I would recommend they have a better system for pick up and drop off. Their clinic would flow a lot better and be more efficient. Over all the staff are friendly and helpful. Thank you taking care of my fur baby.<//Review>

<Text>My personal experience with this hospital has been mostly negative. I rescued a kitty from a backyard that had possibly been attacked by a dog. The kitty was about 5 weeks old at the time. The rescue I volunteered for uses this hospital so he was brought in to be checked out. He was kept for over 5 days due to them being busy and just hadn’t had time to get to him, now this was back in July. I was new to this rescue I didn’t know of this hospital till then, but that should’ve been my first red flag. A rescue friend told me she didn’t like this place and recommended I take him to another hospital. She said  maybe they could save his arm elsewhere. By this time it was determined by Dr. Samir according to rescue Director that kitty would lose his right arm. My friend also mentioned botched surgeries in the past. Plus they tried to give her wrong cats twice when she was picking up. This all should’ve been red flag #2. Although I really didn’t have a say I was not his owner at the time, he belonged to the rescue, I was only his foster at this point. I nursed him back to health throughout his recovery he had other skin issues arise and I was told to take him as his foster and get him treated at same hospital through the rescue. I went in signed in and as I was waiting I took off. Something told me to get the heck out of there. I’m glad I did for the vet tech texted the director told her she wanted to dip him in a medicated dip. Mind you he’s only about 7-8 weeks old at this point and still recovering from an amputation. I decided to treat him topically with shampoo’s and ointments and he recovered nicely. His fur grew back beautifully, and all without that poison. At about 4 months of age I decided to officially adopt Inky. The best decision of my life, for he is the most loving cat I’ve ever met. Fast forward to 2 weeks ago. Inky woke up with a gaping hole size of a quarter at his amputation site. You could literally see his insides if you peeked in, so I was told by my daughter. I refused to see for I love him too much and seeing him hurt or suffering I couldn’t stomach. I rushed him to my Vet at Washington boulevard animal hospital. They saw him right away indeed his incision site opened up six months after his amputation. Dr. Ishida indicated perhaps his amputation should’ve been at the shoulder a complete limb amputation versus leaving partial, his rotator cup and shoulder. The sharp bone that was left there, is more than likely what caused the hole. Now my Inky was looking at another huge surgery. A re amputation to completely remove what was left. I called Colima to have Inky’s 1st surgery paperwork faxed over. I got the run around and told only the rescue could get those papers. 1st of all, I was part of that rescue at that moment. 2nd he is my cat I have adopted him and have cared for him 100% since the day he was rescued. I even raised the funds for his 1st surgery through a fundraiser. So the rescue hasn’t spend but a few dollars for 4 Fvrcp’s and his microchip. Finally the rescue Director called the vet and authorized to release and send paperwork over to my Vet. Inky got his surgery and is 2 weeks post op. Stuck in a 30” crate with huge long incisions with glue, stitches and staples all over. Wearing an uncomfortable e collar and a onesie he hates. He’s in unnecessary pain and is suffering due to his 1st botched surgery, in my opinion. The front desk employees are all very disorganized running all over the place, they need more training in customer service. They at times are not very nice and even rude. I won’t name them but I do know the names of the ones I’ve personally encountered. In the back I only know a couple techs and I cannot say anything negative about my encounters with them. This is in all my personal experience, that I am very much entitled to express.<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

But any ways so I took her in cause I noticed her having complications I got their at 7 but they told me I had to wait until 9 when the c section dr comes in I ended up leaving at 1:30pm that day after c section , I honestly didn't have a lot of money I was hoping they didn't charge me/ or try to make me get her any extra unnecessary stuff like a reverse progesterone test or ultra sound or x ray etc. Cause it was clear she was in labor and needed to get the c section done ASAP so I waited until 9 and the dr seen her, he was a little stand offish maybe cause it was SUPER BUSY & SUPER PACKED & i went in on a WEDNESDAY BUT none the less he did his job I thought that no puppies were gonna make it honestly but in the end he saved 2 females ! And my dog so for that THANK YOU DR , Princess loves you and you are our hero ! See you soon again ! Btw you guys it's always packed so the earlier u go the better and he has the best prices in all of los angeles cause he actually takes good care of the animals not like these other over priced a**holes who just see a pretty dollar not a pretty life .but that was my experience hope it helped y'all in anyway.<//review>< Pictures>

My friends took her frenchie in for a c section. The puppies where switched and given to the wrong person. Colima staff handed these puppies over to the wrong family. The puppies are diffrent breed and the people that have them refuse to return them. Colima hospital has done vary little to correct there error. My friend now has a lawyer and is currently fighting to get her puppies back in good health. Please keep her and her puppies in your thoughts and prays.

This makes u thing:
*What if the puppies switched where the same breed would they say anything?
*Did your puppies get switched?

Yes the prices are fairly low, but it's not worth this type of heart break. I will no longer be affiliated with this place, I'm disgusted !!!</Review>

The staff are all knowledgeable and compassionate. However there arent enough of them causing consistently long waits (plan on a 1.5 hour wait minimum) and are disorganized enough to consistently fail to contact the owners regarding updates with our pets (was not contacted after surgeries 3 of 3 times). The wait times are not helped by anxious pet owners wasting the time of the few staff on hand with incessant "how much longer?" Would come back for planned routine work but waittimes are unsuitable for emergency/time sensitive care.<//review>

<rating>2</rating><Review>this place has good price but very busy all the time and unorganized.  Maybe good for dogs and cats but I brought my bunny and they did say they do exotic animals. My bunny was spayed and currently not eating over 24 hours.  when I brought my bunny back doctor seem to not know the correct dose for my rabbit and  changed the pain med dose from 0.1 to 4 ml. Before that  assistant or nurse girl  recommended to NOT give pain med.
The scarriest part is that Doctor Samio held my bunny by her ears!!!! I was shocked...I .wanted to scream. The only good thing was they offered good compensation.

UPDATE 2/17/2021: my bunny is much better now, after 2 days since surgery I took her to another urgent care animal hospital to do IV and almost immediately she start eating and become normal. So far no issues.</Review>< Pictures>

This place does not abide by COVID guidelines. There were so many people just waiting in the waiting room and hovering outside that it felt unsafe. We had to wait over two hours to be seen and all we wanted was to see if a dog was chipped.</Review>

Dr. Sam is an amazing, compassionate vet. There are very few like him that honestly cares more about the animals than the business. He spends an incredible amount of time helping rescues, and we are forever indebted to him.
He is equally as good with cats as dogs.
I can't say enough good things about him.
Be patient as the place is always busy.</text>

Carol and Trish are the best of the best .. The doctors and team have your pets best interest at heart and have gone above and beyond for me several times. I travel well over an hour to go here from Orange Country .. There is a reason there is so many people and a wait .. There worth it and if it’s an emergency let them know ahead so you can be prioritized</text>

<Date>1598080579576</Date><text>Brought my French Bulldog, Yoda, to have her babies here. One week before Yoda’s due date, we had her complete an X-ray for puppy size and puppy count. A week later we noticed Yoda experiencing some contractions, we drove to Colima Animal Hospital. I could not be happier with the service. Vet had a reverse progesterone test completed. The results did take approximately 2 hours so we did wait quite some time. However, after receiving the results vet decided it was a good time for Yoda to deliver the pups. The whole experience did remind me of when having my own children. Lol After a 6-7 hour wait, Mommy came out very strong from delivering her babies and the litter of 6 pups was very healthy as well. It was a long wait, but worth it!!!! Seems a bit chaotic at first, but after all is said and done I could not be any happier. Mommy and babies would agree as well. The litter is now 7 weeks old and I have to admit Colima Animal Hospital staff was very helpful and supportive every step of the way. They helped by answering all my questions and really caring for each and every one of my furbabies. I never think twice before driving from San Diego (approx. 2 hr drive) to have my babies seen here.</text><userid>114457711093787392535<//userid>< GmapID>

<text>Very 👎,  i will never bring any of my dogs here. We took my Wera for the ear cropping, and they returned her in very bad conditions, very dirty full of blood, smelling bad, they didn't even put a support on her ears or even cover them, what kind of hospital does that, 🤬 please do not take your pets there.
Whoever doctor was, you dont have a heart, you dont care, anyone in there dont care!!!!
She is my puppy she is part of my family, she was not a thing.
I hope that clinic closes as soon as possible.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<gmap_id>0x80c2d5bcca950483:0x5c47b713f43ff405<//gmap_id><text>Good morning pet community, beware of Colima Animal Hospital, I took my pregnant English Bulldog for a C Section with at least 5 pups maybe more that we saw on the screen at an ultrasound done at the Canine Cryobank in San Marcos on her 6 week. Well her temp dropped we went on November 13 (Friday) I know Friday 13th...sigh. They took her in around 1 p.m. We called around 2:30 p.m. The receptionist told us she was on the table, that she would call us as soon as she was out of surgery. Surgery tend to be about an hour with no complications. We have been breeding dogs for 20 plus years, had quite a few dogs with csection procedures before. Well no phone call came after 3 p.m. We headed to the vet, something told me something was wrong. Well we went into the office, had to wait another 30 minutes when finally an office assistant said she was ready and she would bring Chata out. She had no knowledge how many pups or if the mom was fine. Well they brought the pups (2) out on a dog bowl like tray (dirty). I asked them, there were only 2 alive? We're there any still born? She responded that there was only 2. I asked to see the doctor immediately, Dr Sam came out and told me that in fact there was only 2, no stillborn. I told him that I had done an ultrasound done on her on her 5th week and that I had proof that there was at least 5 pups. He told me that ultrasound are not accurate, I responded I understand that's why Canine Cryobank said it was definitely 5 or maybe more. I know what I saw and Carrol at Canine Cryobank saw. She was disgusted what happened. Now I have been hearing from the Fenchie community that some breeders have had similar experiences with Colima.BEWARE!! I am waiting for my attorney to open his office, if you have proof or similar experiences like mine contact me PLEASE. No one should be going through this. BTW the Dr told me that videos are recorded for the csection, what are the chances that my girls was not recorded.<//text><Resp>None< /Resp>< pictures>

My cat only needed a rabies shot. I was quite surprised that this place gave us the shot anyway, considering how little the amount information I could give them. Walk-Ins only .. No appointments required. Very clean inside. Relatively short wait time. We will be taking our other 3 cats there. Fee was only 14.oo .<//review>

They have a horrendous system. The care to my Dog was Okay. But everything else was horrible. The wait time and the way they treat everyone as cattle is deplorable. Since they have such a large amount of business i guess you dont have to work on customer service or any other skill set.</Text>

Seriously the best! Great service and all! I had called so many vets and even went to an emergency clinic the night before, sat waiting in a car with my pup for 4 HOURS. They never took her in even though they saw her injury. Colima was there for my Baby when no one else would see her and she needed help. I just about burst into tears when I called, I was frustrated and angry. They told me bring her right in! I now understand why there were so many people when I arrived. I want to say maybe 30 people waiting on a Saturday at 9 am, the staff and doctors got through them no problem! We waited less than 2 hours which after waiting 4 the previous night was nothing. I expected to pay up to 400 maybe 500 dollars for my maltepoo came out with a bill of 172.oo. She needed stitches and to get her vaccines up to date. To those at Colima Animal Hospital I truly appreciate you all! Thank you so much!</review>

<Review>So yesterday I took my Female English Bulldog for a PTest. I went home and called back within the next 1.5hrs and they didn’t have the results ready. I called back 30mins later which was 2hrs since the test was done and still no results. I called back 3hrs since the test was done and they couldn’t find my dog with my last name and there’s no way the last name could of been confused. My last name is very rare. So they kept looking and found my pets name Bailey but with a different last name and said that most likely those were the results but confused the last name. So the reading came out to be 0.35. I didn’t feel comfortable with the results so I took her somewhere else and guess what the reading were 8.44!!  How ?!?! Unbelievable!!< /Review>< Gmap_id>

PLEASE DO NOT BRING UR PET HERE! This place is so unorganized. The girls in the front don’t have a slight clue what they are doing. Be ready to be here all day. Even just to check in and leave ur dog it takes hours. Don’t be dumb and waist ur time here. Please take ur pet to another vet!</review>< rate>

We called 20 min ahead and told them a cat got hit by car. We arrived and it was packed packed and we said our cat broke her leg and got hit by car and they said it will be 30 min before our cat would be seen. The other people there were just there for check ups. So we went down the street to an animal hospital that took us in right away. Dont waste time coming to a packed careless animal hospital.<//text>

In 2015, I took my dog to get rabies. My vet from banfield told me that the first rabies was expired in January 2015 but they gave the shot in Sep 2015. 8 MONTHS AFTER EXPIRE DATE!!!! I called the manufacturer of the rabies. According to the serial number, it was expired in January 2015.

Horrible experience. Took my dog here because she's been sick and had to wait 3 hours. Kept asking when we can see the vet but every time was replied with we'll be with you soon. The wait is not worth it. I hate this place so much< /text>

The techs are everywhere. The doctor avoids the big time consuming jobs they have you waiting for ever! Prices go up after 4:00 pm and if the dog is bigger than expected the prices goes up as well.<//Review>

<text>Only vet I go to for now on, I ran in to them by hearing great things for a while and a staff member left from my old vet that is so caring and great with animals and with the customers, so I had to go check it out,I hesitated because my vet before was really great and fair, but after I met Dr.Sam from Colima Animal Hospital, I was then hooked instantly and left with a great smile going home knowing my bulldogs got the best Vet anywhere around, he is as honest as you can get, very fair and great on all of above, on dog needs and customer service etc etc... I ain't going anywhere else for now on for any of my fury pets,it's very hard to find the right fit but I know I finally did 1000percent,  I have 4and they all got a new vet and just as great is there staff, great all around hands down, especially Trish she is the best, super helpful, knowledgeable, kind, that's a big huge plus for my pets🙏🙏 if I can use only two words to describe them "Simply Amazing"<//text>< UserId.>

The place was chaotic and unorganized. I took a cat there to get spayed. The cat was there for over 8 hours and they didn't clean it up after the surgery when it was returned to me.</review>

<Review>The staffs were nice. But the doctor... did NOT check well my 9 year female pomeranian. My dog vomitted blood  and had diarrhea. The doctor had a blood test and I called the next day and the day after to find out the result. On the 3rd day, the doctor finally called to tell me that my dog had a pancreas inflammation. But 2 months later, my dog got sick again and it was serious uterus infection. If he had diagnosed this earlier, my dog would not suffer this much. He did not diagnos, explain, or have proper treatment well.
For routine check up and vaccine may be ok, but if your pet is seriously ill, Do Not Go here.< /Review><resp>None< /resp><pictures>None<//pictures>< name>

<text>Three personable, knowledgable vets with many years of dedication to animals.  I've been dedicated to Dr Sam for years. No matter where you live this is the Animal Hospital. Theirs no exploitation.  This you rarely find with other vets. I cringe as my friends share their shocking exploitive experiences. I guess to most people money represents good care. No it doesnt.
Lastly the support staff is dedicated. They all have the ability to multitask.  Whether their vet techs or not they are extreamly knoledgable.

Glad to see that Dr Sam has relocated and reopened his practice after the tragic fire last November in the shopping mall in his original location. However, I don't think everyone knows that Dr Sam has relocated though. And that he is has reopened in Hacienda Heights under a different name. I even got confused when I got there I had to call to asked if that was them...lol...ironically they didn't even know what the sign outside their office said their was....Hahaha...or that they were located next to what business. I know they are still adjusting and trying to get used to their new location. It appeared that they are trying to fix and prepare the facility to better accommodate future cares and needs of   sick as well as healthy patients. I have been bringing my pets to Dr Sam for almost 30 years, and will continue to so even when if it means driving down from Lake Arrowhead! He's the only vet I truly trust my Babies with!<//review>

I had a beyond aweful experience yesterday at Colima Animal Hospital. The front desk girl named Maddy was very rude and condescending. She uncompassionatly yanked my puppy away from me so hard over the wide counter they have there, that when she handed him back to me he was coughing and very scared and frightened, so much so that we saw the vet that was available to make sure he was alright. We even had to call the front desk while we were sitting there because they forgot us and took so long just to get us in to see the vet.
When we asked for any copies of the paper and receipts she responded condescendingly, and very slowly got the paperwork after being asked four times for it and after we telephoned the desk again.
When we finally did get the paperwork telling us what shots were done we realized she did not do what I asked for.I told her exactly what shot I needed for my puppy three times and I even wrote it down for her and instead she gave him a different shot, not the one I asked for at all. She didn't even bother to say that they didn't have the shot I needed even though she had the chance to and when I asked if they had the shot I needed she even said yes, that they had it.
When we got him home he yelped whenever we touched his chest. It was not because of his shot, because the shot was on his shoulder, not his chest. It got bad enough that we took him back to the Colima Animal Hospital to have him looked at and x-rayed, there were no breaks or broken ribs. His chest area is probably bruised from Maddy grabbing him and picking him up so roughly and uncaringly, in a way that did not support his body at all.
He is still yelping and coughing when his chest is touched. He was even checked for kennel cough so that is not the issue. We had to take him to another vet today and pay another vet fee to make sure he is truly alright.
Maddy is ill-fit, uncompassionate, lacks hospitality, condescending, deaf, hateful, and obviously cannot read, and lacks knowledge of her job. She does not deserve to be in the position that she is in, and she makes Colima Animal Hospital look very bad, which is a shame because the vets are very kind. I'm embarrassed for them.
I'm only giving them one star because the veterinarians and the other office staff are nice, but even with that being said this is how bad Maddy makes them look, she is a liability for Colima Animal Hospital.
She hurt my puppy.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) I always take my 4patitas companions to Colima Animal Hospital, they always welcome us, everyone who arrives treats them. It is sad but it comes to pass I had 2 desires and they were big, they are in charge of giving you their little body or doing the cervice and they give you their ashes in a box with a trace of them. And the truth is not expensive.

(Original)
Yo siempre llevo mis compañeros de 4patitas a Colima Animal Hospital.siempre nos reciben ,todos los que llegan los atienden. Es triste pero llega a pasar tuve 2 desesos ya estavan grandes ,ellos se encargan de entregarte su cuerpecito ó hacer el cervicio y te entregan sus cenizas en una cajita una huella de ellos. Y la verdad no es caro .< /Review>

< Review>
This visit was a 2nd vax. and to be fair, the center itself seemed otherwise quiet/closed.  Really, a great community resource and thoughtfully planned. There are beautiful moments throughout the campus, from the tranquility of the atrium garden to the alluring aroma of the flowers on the California Buckeye tress, definitely worth a visit when the various centers reopen.<//Review>

Great place. Glad my town offers these services. Over the years Ive used the preschool, activity center, the theatre, and most of the grounds for various fairs. The place is really a gem. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Do wish the fair ticket prices were more reasonable but I'm not sure who determines that.<//Text>

I've been there for musical events. A very elegant place locally, to take in a show. Weekdays the parking lot that circles the center is great for walking. Twice around = 1 mile. Sure beats the canal walkways, which can be congested at times. Take in The Nutcracker during the holidays. Very family friendly.</text>

Large building, multiple rooms, one very large gathering area which can be made smaller by sliding walls. Tables and chairs are available. A large bar area, kitchen and stage. Have your next event at RP Community Center< /Text>

<text>They didn't have the check in system open so they took another couple in then finally checked is us in.  A family walks in and gets helped again before us and we have to move to be in front of their faces so we don't get skipped again. Staff wasn't sure what the promotions were and just asked me to check my phone which basically says next time don't come in just do it online. Verizon you never fail to disappoint. On a good note I was able to add a line and picked a nice number for it too.< /text>< pics>

We were moving from one provider to Verizon with each line having some sort of complex situation. The employees were extremely patient and helpful in resolving the situation. Specifically, Avo helped us out a ton and was very kind whilst doing so. Great experience and highly recommend this Verizon store. If you’re patient with them, they will be patient with you.</Review>

Purchased I phone 11 Pro 2 weeks ago from this store. The phone was malfunctioning.  Took it back to exchange it. I was told that they don't have it in stock by very a rude employee. I asked her if they can order it for me. She said they can and it will take 2 days to receive it , but I have to leave my current phone with them before they can place an order . I told them why should I leave my phone and be phone-less for two days. She replied that is the store's policy with a smirk on her face. I told her that it doesn't make sense, but she kept telling me it's their policy. I just walked away, never going back.<//review>

I don’t know the circumstances of the people working here or the business in general, and i know working in the service industry is hard. That being said, i was told it would take 10 minutes to see me about 5 times and was in there for over an hour just to get a new SIM card, which took about 2 minutes. I don’t mind if you’re slammed, but please don’t lie to me. Judging by other reviews, this Is normal practice.

This was also after setting an appointment online, which I’m pretty sure does nothing.</review>

Horrible place came in at 2:15 and came out at 5:00!!! Absolutely horrible service. Took an hour to place new screen protectors on 2 phones. Took another hour just to get a phone. Don’t recommend Bruce. Took him 30 minutes just to scan a barcode. Screen protectors had dust and other black things in it.We wanted a new screen protector they said they can’t. I was so mad just walked out. I would rather drive ten minutes to go to go to apple. I hope the manager sees this so he can change his stores service.<//Review>

<rating>1</rating><Review>I just came in the store to adjust my Verizon Bill.  When I asked what my bottom line per month would be, they gave me a specific number after adding all charges and features that my new plan would have.  After about 3 days, I received a text from Verizon saying my new bill was 2.5 times more from what I was quoted.  I came back in the following weekend to correct this obvious mistake.  The manager and the sales associated disappeared in the back room for about half an hour after having initially explained the problem.  After an additional 15 minutes of the manager and the associate trying to correct my billing cycle charge, I was kicked out of the store.  I had at most a frustrated demeanor due to the wait time and the store not willing to admit fault, but in now way was I stark raving mad or procrastinating like a lunatic.  I'm in the service industry, I get it, sometimes customers come in in a pissed off mood.  But kicking out a customer for trying to correct a bill?  Fortunately to Verizon credit, I was able to correct my bill through the phone.  Don not go to this store.  Save yourself the headache and just call 611, or do your business online or some other brick store elsewhere.<//Review>< Pics>

<Text>I got totally frustrated with trying to get a Jetpack and cell phone online, and then calling another Verizon store and getting no help and conflicting information.  When I called the Glendale Galleria Verizon, Hovik talked to me and then we made an appointment for me to go there in the afternoon.  He was very knowledgeable, very nice and patient, and saved Verizon from losing the sale.  This is my third good experience over the years with the Galleria Verizon, and next time I'll just go there in the first place.<//Text><rating>5<//rating><Response>None</Response><user_id>118213965246001646047</user_id>< Pictures>

I went in with my damaged phone for personal service. I was directed to a phone to file a damage claim, which meant sitting on hold and entering numbers on a phone with poor service that cut in and out. Do your job!! If I wanted to sit on hold, I could have done that at home. Also, the insurance they provide through Asurion is a scam--if you have it, get rid of it. I paid $9 a month for two years and after my phone failed, was told there is a $150 deductible. Customers don't buy insurance for an OPPORTUNITY to purchase an old, refurbished iPhone at inflated prices.<//review>

I had a phone that was nothing but problems, and when it finally died completely, I went in to this store to try and get help. Shant and Harmony not only helped me get a new phone, but managed to get my monthly bill reduced. They are very helpful and did their best to make up for the inconvenience I'd had.< /Text>

<Text>not too bad, they greet right away and help. but what I didn't like was their intensive trying to sell something to me, and what was strange, first the rep said the thing costs $220, but when he was doing the final calculations it became $375 ... strange isn't it? :)</Text>< Pics>

Worst customer service ever experienced. Rude sales people:
Andreea L, Solutions Specialist, very rude. When I asked to speak with the manager, she said the manager is in a meeting would you like to wait?
When I said yes, she said, she'll be out in 1h30min. I could hear the smirk under her breath!!!!
Horrible!< /Text>

They are only nice to you if you "BUY" something. If you have any Problems or Issues or need to talk about a return, they ignore you like a leper.

When they try to sell me something, they "LIED" to me and then went back on what they said, when I confronted their mistakes. Its people like these that ruin a store's name. I will never buy anything from them. BEWARE they will "lie" and give "misinformation" to get you to sign that contract.<//review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>After knowing this store for many years,
And many bad experiences, we went back with hope, and since it's closest to where we live. The store looked nice for a Saturday pm, not long wait, and we met Andreea, the solutions specialist at Verizon, she changed our all old bad experiences to a great one. From the first moments she showed care, kindness and professionalism at the top level. My 13 years old daughter felt great,  I was very happy with the result. SHE Listens to the customer first and then she offers solutions and makes suggestions, she was like buying the phone for her own little sister. Andreea you are blessed, keep up the great work. We upgraded to iphone8 plus and she installed the screen protector very professionally in front of us way better than Apple store workers...and promissed an exchange for the wireless charger which I was not sure about. When I returned the next day for exchange thank God she was there, they didn't have the one I wanted, she checked the new shipments, then found it in a closer location she made the phone arrangements, and handed me the address, within an hour I walked into the other store picked up the charger I wanted, and even I got $10 price difference credited to my account. ALL sales people should learn to care and listen to customers first, every customer loves attention and respect, then they will pay you...Awsome job Andreea!
5 star is for you, and to be fair, those girls at the front desk were quick to greet, and I loved the quick notifications on my phone, and the store was clean. But for me the human interaction was top factor.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<Text>The store messed up two things for me  when I was purchasing my new phone. I couldn't activate it for 4 days after receiving it by mail , bcz they payment is still pending. I spent over 4 hours with the costumer service over the phone, and the only solution to fix the problem to go back to the store.
Also the reason it took so long talking on the phone with the costumers service, is that the store sold me insurance for the old phone instead of for the new one, and the Verizon couldn't just transfer it easily at first.
When I call the store they said "Sorry, our system does crash sometimes" and "Verizon doesn't offer anything  to the costumers for any sort of inconvenience "

My family with the Verizon for 13 years and if not the "coverage" I'd definitely switch ...
Just for now I'll avoid coming in to this particular store< /Text>< Gmap_id>

<pictures>None< /pictures><Text>By far the wost and shadiest service ever.  You can tell because once upon a time this place used to be booming with customers; where are they now?  Either at other retail locations or doing business online.

I went to upgrade one of my lines - a simple no-frills required task right?  Not exactly.  Right away one of the Sales Reps (Haroon) came over to assist.  How nice I thought, I didn't even have to chheck in on the nice little terminal.  I told Haroon that I wanted to upgrade a line so I gave him the info to look up.

Well, Haroon must have thought that he had a sucker in front of him because he said that in order to upgrade I would have to:
- change my entire plan on all my lines because I was under an older plan
- that the phone I wanted could not be sold to me; they only sold the phone in a bundle

I don't think so, I said.  No bundle, no changing of plan.  I just want the phone.  Please go get it I said.  So, Haroon proceeded to go to the back; 10 minutes and no Haroon.

Seeing that I was just standing around two other reps approached; I told them what I wanted and it may be that I was talking a bit slow so that they could comprehend what I wanted instead sent a gal to come and assist me.  I told the gal that I wanted a phone which she later told me that they did not have in stock.  She told me to go to the apple store to purchase it and then come back down to activate.

Needing the phone I went to purchase the phone at the apple store NO HASSLES and or changing of plans and I was told, I didn't need to go back downtairs to activate.

Very poor service. I've been there about  3 to 4 times and every single time I had a terrible experience of waiting for a long time and also lots of wrong information from sales persons and store managers. Last time I was there to upgrade my phone I stayed Thera for about an hour and half talking to different employees and managers and they ended up send me home with out upgrading it.< /Review>

Worst customer service ever...My experience has made me HATE verizon. They literally LIE to customers claiming tablets are free and you just have to pay 10 dollars access lines, dont be fooled...they do not tell you about a 40 dollar activation fee and that you will be tied to that tablet for 2 years so at the end of the day, you are paying 240 dollars plus 75 dollars equipment fees. By the time you see all this in your bill, its too late to opt out. They make people wait in the store for hours. The manager Faibal/Faizal and team member Brian are the worse representatives you can work with. They totally ignore you when you have issues but will lie to you to seel you something. I am going to complain to the consumer board as well. Please join me to create a movement of change at this location.<//Text>

The shop over all has a great atmosphere and it’s hard to not laugh at the jokes him and his co workers make. It is appointment only but it’s better to have a set time that’s for you instead of waiting hours</Review><pics>None<//pics><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

<review>We have been going here for a couple years now and they never disappoint! They live up to their name for sure and we would trust no one else to cut our sons hair. We have three boys plus my husband and they each see different barbers, each one is amazing in their own way. Extra shot out to Steve though, he is a serious artist lol<//review>< Pictures>

<text>Been going here for a few years now. Everyone at the shop does a great job, but I always schedule with the dude Omar. The atmosphere is always lively at the shop. Great place to get a cut, have some laughs, listen to music or watch a movie or sports game on the TVs. Recently updated their prices to $30 for a haircut. Still worth it for sure.<//text></record></dataset><record>

These guys is where it's at. Thomas gave one look to the reference picture (of me) which I gave him and did a better job than what I had expected. They've earned themselves a regular. Cheers!<//review>

Just got a good cut from Steve. Shared some knowledge about a good hair style with me. $25 for a guy who knows what he's doing and is nice about it is well worth it.<//review>

< Review>
My wife and I had lunch here at South Coast Plaza in April 2018. We enjoyed the open patio feel of the restaurant where we could engage in a little people watching while having a relaxing meal. Our Romanian waitress was very helpful. Our feeling is that the menu items are a bit over priced. We felt that the food could have been much more tasty. The portions were adequate. The bread provided with the meal was far from spectacular. No oil or butter or anything offered to improve the bread.<//Review>

A preferred place for mediterranean food. I like it here, great food & service. Looking forward to a return trip. Prices are reasonable I would say. Food and feeling reminds me of Kansas City.< /review>

<Text>I would stay away from this place. I was there on Tuesday. Most of the menu was unavailable, the bar only had a handful of drinks,  and it seems to me they're ready to go out of business...

The server that helped us knew absolutely nothing about the menu and had no clue that almost everything was unavailable...< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

The food was yummy, but for my dish, the shrimp ravioli, it was very expensive for the amount. $20 for 6 ravioli. It was really yummy though. my fiance got a pizza and it was a reasonable price for a lot of food, so that was good. You will enjoy the food, You just won't be full unless you spend a lot of money or get a pizza.< /review>

<Text>I admire this spot! They serve first-cleass dishes, they have a nice menu, The cook in that restaurant is a specialist, I like a lot trying all their food. The dishes are consistently of high class, the attitude towards the clients  is helpful. I  go often to this place and I was never unsatisfied. I recommend it to all my friends.</Text>< pictures>

Can't say enough good. To many fine dining establishments sell you on a fine dining atmosphere but the food just isn't up to snuff. This is one of those that break that trend. One of my favorite spots now. Can't wait to go back.<//Text>

<Review>They didn’t take order as who sat down first. They brought food first to the table that ordered alcohol. We waited an hour and half for even an appetizer to put on our table, and the two families that came after us got serve and finished food and drink even before our appetizer was put on our table. Terrible service. The lamb tagine was not only not cooked as described in the menu but also tasted disgusting. Don’t take your kids to this awful restaurant. Your kids definitely will be starving. At least my kids said we would never go back this bad restaurant. No business from our families for at least two generations.< /Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
Domingo the waiter is fantastic. The chicken kebab is very good and moist, not overcooked at all. Unfortunately the appetizers were not impressive. The Patatas Bravas were literally cubed breakfast potatoes, with a miniscule bit of fine diced tomato/peppers mixture sprinkled on top. I thought they would come in a nice tomato based sauce/drizzle. The falafel was good. The roasted brussel sprouts were good. Overall things were ok, it's just that nothing wowed me, and the prices were kind of high.<//Review>

The bartenders were so rude and have absolutely zero idea of the “service industry” we ended up needing to speak to the manager and as I tried to explain my unhappiness, he laughed and said’ “sorry it’s my first day!” In the matter of the two hours we were at the bar waiting for our drinks and our one appetizer we witnessed at least 6 different sets up people get up and leave from the absolutely awful service!<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

Wine and appetizers weren't too bad but then my husband asked for some linguine with seafood and the waiter suggested instead some fish soup as a day special. My husband was bice enough to accept the suggestion and got the soup. Other than being 10 dollars more expensive than what he wanted ( the waiter did not specify the price when suggesting, so we left him a 4% tip -still too nice ) this soup caused 2 days of stomachache and vomit to my husband. I will not return there again. NEVER.<//Review>

I was pleased with the ambiance and the menu was promising with both Italian and Mediterranean options. Seems like the service was a little slow as there were only a handful of people dining. The lamb kafta was just warm and I was a little disappointed that they do not serve the traditional Basmati rice but a variant of it. Maybe next time I'll go for the pizza or salad. Full bar available. I will come back to try one of the pizzas and a glass of wine.</Review>

Absolutely everything is phenomenal. The beef shish is just amazing. The tavuk is fantastic. Service is fast and kind.

The chef at times comes to check on you, how cool is that!

Im writing this review after eating here about 10 times in the last 3 months.  My favorite place in the OC.< /Review>< Pictures>

I thought this was a good addition to SCP. I had the chicken kebabs which were tasty. The salad was disappointing and not the best Mediterranean spot I've been too. If you are at the mall, hit it up but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here.</Review>

<text>Upon arrival we were greated with high expectations that this was a respectable restaurant. Later we were disappointed by the terrible, terrible, dry, and cold bread sticks with the tiny, tiny peto. Also, our waiter disappeared on us and the bus boy had to bring us the bread. I recommend not buying the raviolis. When I received it looked to be a big plate of dog food. I don't know if they just opened a big can of dog food, and dumped it on my plate! When I thought I had just enough of this terrible service and food I had to ask roughly 10 min later if I could have my bill.  I will no longer be eating at this establishment.< /text>< Gmap_id>

<Review>(Translated by Google) We ate salad, falafel, hummus, margarita and others, and we enjoyed it, as well as the wonderful service and tasty trameso and the alcohol.
Nice experience.

The food is definitely pricey, but it’s yummy.</text>< Pictures>

Decent prices for a kid's meal, but adult food is a bit overpriced.
Kid's burgers were good but way too salty.
Sushi burrito was definitely not worth it. Looks like they are mass produced at start of the day and kept very cold. Flavor was just ok.
Chicken and waffles were very tasty, but my wife got sick from eating it.
People there are really nice and friendly.</text>

<Review>I was skeptical about this place but was very happy with the quality and quantity of food. I ordered the poke Nacho's, pork buns and the poke tacos for two people and it was way too much food.  They load the poke on everything and the quality was amazing.  This place is going to be a weekly visit for sure.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<gmapID>0x808f9e70368c1e15:0xb925e570a7b189c1<//gmapID><review>Super slow service and a generally unwelcoming atmosphere. There was only one menu, on the board above the counter where they take orders, so you can't figure out what to order unless you're standing at the counter in everyone's way. The man behind the counter was getting impatient with all of our questions and we tried to figure out the fusion menu. It took fifteen minutes to get my drink, and longer for the food. The rose wine by the glass was room temperature, and when we asked for a cold glass we got a blank stare and we're told that how they serve it. Here did relent and find a cold bottle. The food was pretty good, but not really worth the wait. And there are TV's on every wall, which I find distraction<//review>< Name>

<Review>There's not many options on the menu and the food is regular. You have 7 options of draft beer! A good option if you won't to drink a beer a eat something regular.<//Review><userid>107546072060622466692< /userid>< pics>

The staff was very friendly and nice. The food was not that great, it was ok but lacking a lot of flavor. I feel like it has the potential to be awesome, but misses the mark.<//Text>

The Pork Belly Corn dogs would've been better without the mustard inside, in my opinion, and the flavor of the chicken of the chicken and waffles was a little too acidic for my taste. Other than that everything was top notch. The waffles and the syrup were so delicious. Ahi tacos and nachos, and philly cheesesteak buns were delicious as well.< /text>

My first impression of this Dermatology office was beautiful, clean and professional. The front desk staff are professional and friendly. I was seen by Nurse Danielle, who made me feel comfortable and relaxed. I’ve had some skin issues for a while now and she has helped clear up most of my adult acne, I love my results so far! She explains everything as she goes and answers all of my questions. Oh, and a little Botox never hurt anyone 😉<//text>

First impression coming into this office it was clean, love the decor and the staff was extremely friendly and attentive as soon as you walk in the door. Not like a regular snooty dermatologist office where they don't pay any attention to you and make you a bit intimidated for even going. That set the tone for the entire visit.

After getting a consultation and a plan from Dr. Newman; who is highly knowledgeable in everything dermatology and more. He immediately made me feel comfortable and listened to what I wanted.

Nurse Danielle gave me my first treatment today and although I felt a bit embarrassed of my skin; I've never actually been one to go to a dermatologist or even get a facial and I'm 35! She made me throw my worries way and made the appointment a breeze. She was professional, friendly and well versed in all of the treatments that they recommended. She was able to answer all of my questions, refreshing how knowledgeable she was. The lasers and peels targeted my skin issues... I scar or get brown spots easily and I had a few pimple like cysts that she was able to take care of. I can't wait to continue going there (even though the drive is 1.5 hrs for me coming from OC - it shows that it's worth it!).

Thank you Dr. Newman, Nurse Danielle and the team for making my first visit an amazing one. Can't wait to see the results and feel more confident in my skin.<//review>

I went to four other doctors for my inflammations and not one took the time to help me they would each give me a little tube of antibiotic 0.01% which is nothing and one doctor came in the room with one bandage said this should take care of it????  So when Dr Newman came in and throughly checked all of my sores and infections I was thrilled to see that he relieved my pain right away ,and each time they got better and better so thank you wonderful Doctor and all of your very nice staff i am forever grateful.< /Text>

I've known Dr. Newman since his early starts. Not only is he the hardest working doctor, but he and his staff are the most courteous, caring, and professional people you could ever meet. The office itself is beautiful. My skin has never felt and looked better since I've been under his treatment. I travel 30 miles one way just to be treated by him. Dr. Newman is definitely the best Dermatologist in Los Angeles. If you want your skin to look the best, you must visit his office.</review>

<review>Appt. date March 23, 2021: I really don’t know how this doctor has any patients. He was so rude and uninterested in giving me a proper consultation. I actually called him out on it, I said hey come on, I’ve taken time out of my day and paid $125 for a consultation,  do your job... I have questions! I normally would have requested a refund but I was too busy to argue with the front desk over 100 bucks. Let’s just say I definitely will not be returning. He didn’t even bother to properly look into what type of insurance I have. He’s out of network for me but he said I have HMO insurance by glancing at my card but that’s not true,  I have PPO, which is irrelevant regardless cause most the doctors I go to don’t even accept insurance no matter what type you have but this guy is def not worth paying for out of pocket. It also seems as if his practice is a little outdated as they do not offer a lot of modern procedures like PRP facials and their lasers looked outdated.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

I'm so glad my sister found this doctor, he is a great dermatologist he takes the time to not only check what you are there for but he listens to you and doesn't judge or cuts you off as many other doctors do when you go in for a consult, he explains what he needs to do, or to see what procedure or treatment he needs to do for you. When I came back with my mom to get the results of the biopsy of the skin spots on her cheek and ear he took the time to explain to us what the results were, he explained to both of us in the exam room, then he took me to another waiting room to explain to me in detail what the results were and the procedure he was going to do for her. He was carrying and understandin enough to see that my mom was so nervous so he did that out of respect and I so appreciated that gesture on his behalf. That same day Carlos started the first session of treatment (scraping off) it's how I can explain it, since then she's been going every four weeks to do laser treatments BRITTANY (I hope I wrote it correctly) has been doing them and all I can say is that we couldn't have gotten a better nurse to tend to her needs, she is amazing she's gentle and patient with my mom as she is a nervous wreck when ever she goes to any medical office. The entire staff is very nice and professional in every aspect, they make you feel welcomed and relaxed when you go in the office, even the valet gentleman and the lady security guard at the entrance are so nice and attentive with everyone. Also as for cleanliness during this Civic 19 pandemic they have sanitation stations from the time you come out your car to inside the entire building, the staff and all patients are required to wear a face covering and needles to say the office is spotless.
I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THAT EVERYONE GOES TO THIS DERMATOLOGIST DR. ARMAND NEWMAN IS THE BEST<//Review>

<review>Dr. Newman is simply the best. I’ve. Been seeing him and his nurse Danielle for a few years now. I initially went to him because of my acne scars that were haunting me from my teenage years. I am now delighted to say that there is almost no trace of my childhood acne scarring on my face today! Dr. Newman and his entire team are truly amazing and very compassionate! It was truly a blessing to have heard about him<//review>< Date>

I have multiple tattoos that needed to be removed and he explained that it will be a process to remove but explained it will be a realistic goal to have. A year later my tattoos are completely gone and I'm so happy that I don't have to live with them for the rest of my life. His lasers are top of the line & I would highly recommend him for tattoo removal< /Review><Time>1582240715179<//Time><Gmap_id>0x80c2bbfe41dd8145:0xd11f89e17b1c0432< /Gmap_id><Name>Richards Sosa< /Name><Rate>5</Rate>< user>

Dr. Newman is the finest dermatologist I've ever known, and I've met a number of them in my 67 years. I've suffered from acne, basal cell carcinomas, and cysts all my life. He tackled all my problems brilliantly. He's intelligent and kind. We discuss literature, philosophy, and history sometimes. He's wonderful. Moreover, his staff is friendly and smart. I've been going to him for ten years. I highly recommend this team.<//text>

The nurses steered me towards a less intrusive method, which did not work. Subsequently charging me more and more for each visit. Meanwhile, $1300 later, I still have the skin condition. I don’t believe the dermatologist is board-certified. Do your homework! Completely unprofessional, and predatory.</Text>< pics>

I’ve been going to Dr. Newman for over 15 years.  I always get compliments on my skin and get asked where I go. I have referred a lot of my family to Dr. Newman.  My husband has started going with me as well. The staff has always been very professional and sweet.  Thank you Danielle for taking your time with us.< /text>

I love the excellent quality of  service I received at every visit. Good doctors are sometimes hard to find. But I have found one of the BEST Doctor in the World. I am very grateful. His office staff is very professional and very helpful. I traveled over 120 miles round trip  and the drive is worth it. Job well done Dr. Armand Newman and his staff.</Text>

<date>1579889654856<//date><Rate>5</Rate><Text>pon finding a painful lump that needed immediate care I my sheer luck with my research of the best skin doctors in Los Angeles was seen the same day after I had already made another appointment for the next day. The reception was so positive from the lovely staff and the doctor was so experienced that my stress of the painful lump was resolved. Then being 40 years in Asia in the sun they immediately assisted me by checking my whole body. The doctor and staff did above and beyond all the doctors I've experienced in my 70 years and especially in Los Angeles where I have been treated so shabbily from the doctors just trying to made money on useless tests and procedures. I fully know everyone needs a skin doctor for their family,s needs and I hope they find Dr Newman and his nurse Danielle< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Wow so amazing, I have to thank DR Newman and his staff for helping my sons Skin Condition and helping us understand what not to do and how to heal my sons skin. They took the time to explain to my 5 year old son and my self how to take care of his skin condition and how to use the products as well and made sure we were comfortable with our instructions.

His products works like miracles! The cleanser for face and body and cream for severe dry skin has erased my sons dry skin and eczema.

Remember he is located in Beverly Hills, you get what you pay for and Dr Newman is the BEST!
I took my son else where prior to finding Dr Newman, for his skin condition and they prescribed a few creams and ointments but made it worse, if anything. So no more going around for price cuts here.
Dr Newman's visit was a reasonable price for Beverly Hills and he cured my sons skin.

Thank you DR Newman.<//text>

My experience and treatments with Dr. Newman is excellent, the results are at the highest lest level that I could have possibly expected. He is at the top edge of understanding the procedures that are necessary for basically every need that is required for a highly skilled dermatologist. His staff is extremely professional, courteous and informative. You absolutely could not be in better hands than with Dr. Newman</Review>

This was a terrible experience! He was the worst doctor I have ever been to. So rude and demeaning! He way overcharged me based on my insurance copay. It was a total scam. Only pushed his own lasers that were not covered by insurance instead of treatments that are. It was such a terrible experience to go through after waiting in the lobby for over 2 hours! I have no idea how he is in business and has return patients. I would Never reccommend this doctor. If felt as if I was in a country where a patients couldn't ask a question without being repromanded. I don't know if this man has a problem with female patients, but he was so rude and degrading I couldn't even believe it!<//text>

100% recommend to everyone!! Hands down the best tour I’ve taken while in San Francisco. Amazing experience filled with awesome sights, laughs, and a bunch of historical insight into the city. Captain Charles played a big part in that! He’s very friendly and knowledgeable. The ride is also a lot more comfortable than it would seem. Overall, this is a must-do in my opinion!! Worth every penny.< /Review>

HIGHLY RECOMMEND the Bay Voyager- a MUST DO while in San Francisco. Captain Charles was amazing and provided the perfect blend of FUN and safety with a little education mixed in. Our group ranged in age from 9 - 72 years young and everyone enjoyed the sunset cruise. Still talking about it days later. THANK YOU CAPTAIN CHARLES!< /text>

Had a great time on Bay Voyager, was a little concerned about the little boat with the choppy waters but this thing went through the water like butter. Felt like we could get up close and stop at  things that the bigger boats just physically can't. Plus with smaller numbers, open air, it's a great option at the moment< /text>

Definitely best day ever yesterday! I booked a trip for me an my daughter long story short me an my coworker went together and it was dope!!! Captain Charles was super professional easy going an cool! I made it there with literally two minutes to spare and he still made it a point to help me find the loading dock. At first I was thinking the price was wayyy too much but the experience itself definitely made it worth it! And I got literally the best selfie of my vacation under the GOLDEN GATE BRIDE!!! 😍😍 Definitely recommend anyone new to the area or just wanting to experience San Francisco to take this tour!!!< /Review>

<Review>Without question one of the best family tours we have done. Captain Charles was excellent, his passion and enthusiasm for the harbor was outstanding.
We had perfect weather, which added to the experience.
Have layers on and this will be fun in all weather.<//Review><response>None< /response><Name>Matthew Brady< /Name><Rate>5</Rate><gmapID>0x808580fd1b08fd19:0xc73d2720317d5f5< /gmapID>< user>

<review>I loved my bay cruise! Captain Charles is the best! He gave us a great ride! He was friendly and has incredibly interesting facts about the Bay! He kept us entertained and safe! The view of the Golden Gate Bridge from the water is something I will never forget! If you're ever in San Francisco the bay cruise by  Bay Voyager should be at the top of your list of things to do!< /review>< pictures>

This was an excellent experience definitely a must if you visit the San Francisco Bay area. Me and my family had such a good time and got to see many beautiful landmarks. In my group the youngest child was 5 years old and he loved it, all the kids did not want to get off the boat. Excellent customer service and worth every penny!!Thank you Captain Charles</review>

<text>STOP reading and just BOOK THE TRIP!
this by far was the best part of our visit to San Francisco!  Captain Charles's knowledge of the city, and experience on the water was beyond impressive.  Each time we passed a different tour boat on the water I only smiled more because it was confirmed this was THE BEST and only way to see the sights of San Francisco.  Bay Voyager at Pier 39 in San Francisco is #1 of the top things to do in San Francisco.</text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOsOwiSQSc-uKuj7Fq1ukCC8UyndN20pO_0w9Nk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

I was worried about being sick on the boat but it wasn’t that aggressive and was honestly a lot of fun .  We met some swimmers and Learned about San Francisco. Very Interesting stories and a really funny host ! The host gave us a lot of good recommendations to eat and see . We even got a ball from giants stadium !  Definitely doing this again whenever I visit San Fran ! Highly recommend!</Review><response>None<//response></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Great tour and good value for money.  Unfortunately after mailing the owner various times to upload his photographs of us all in the boat there was no response.  4 years later he still has not uploaded the photos online, it is quite upsetting as he was the only person who could get the photos of us all in the boat.  My advice is to ask him to take a photo with your camera so that you have one.< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN-6t4KpF2qnKsgIOPG16wSoDnkHoxHxKHr9pCA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNQEEzmG77LlH2X-TxhAe-hVJ4lNk1YMfenK7Jw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNtWsiZzYPc-twW_tLC3dGti4XF4ZCale8hZVHc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNzhvl9ZgBJBkpuDacB50so90O8U3oY9w2gcBgE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOlSF1HE8M8UmdII3wddP2ABPMhmm3rV5_JAyx0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNL85Zt83DJCGt0Rh8BTKmvf29WIgjrmINoiw21=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x808580fd1b08fd19:0xc73d2720317d5f5</GmapID></record>

Hands down one of the best tours of San Francisco!

Captain Charles made every moment amazing, from putting on lifejackets to cruising under the Golden Gate and Bay bridges!

The adrenaline junkie in me loved flying over the Bay in the boat, and the history buff loved all of the historical information and personal anecdotes from the Captain and tour guide.

I will definitely be recommending this trip to any future visitors to the Bay and would 100% take it again. Thank you Bay Voyager!< /Text>

I've been on this tour 3 times now, and it's my go-to thing to do when I have out of town friends come visit the Bay Area. The views are spectacular! You get to see the Golden Gate Bridge, Bay Bridge, AT&T Park, and many other great sights from a unique perspective that very few actually get to see. You get to geek out in fowl weather gear, and hop out into the Pacific Ocean in a super fast and super fun boat. But the thing that really makes this tour great is the guide - Captain Charles. He's extremely personable, knowledgable, and always has an enthusiastic attitude. Clearly Captain Charles loves it when his passengers have an outstanding time out on the Bay. He's 3 for 3 with me, and I expect many more trips in the future.

The Bay Voyager rib boat surprisingly makes for a smooth ride, despite being insanely fast & seemingly lightweight. It's great fun racing out to the Golden Gate Bridge and beyond, but Captain Charles is mindful of who's on board, and I've seen him tailor the speed to those who may appreciate a more gentle trip. He regularly checks in to make sure everybody is having fun, and I've seen him speed up and slow down based on how people are experiencing the ride. He's very attentive to who's on board, and does a great job of customizing the game plan on the fly.

The commentary is fantastic. You learn about the history of the early 1900s earthquake and subsequent fire, as well as history around a merchant ship that was involved in the Normandy armada in WW2, along with a sub that never missed a torpedo hit. Captain Charles actually served on the crew of the WW2 ship in a reunion event - great stories there! You also get to see lighthouses, hiking trails, extremely overpriced housing (hey it is the Bay Area), World's Fair monuments, Lucas Arts studios, and a gazillion other San Francisco shoreline sights. Most locals will spend decades here before seeing most of what you'll see on this tour.

I first found Bay Voyager after taking an out of town friend on a visit to Alcatraz, and we both found the boat ride to be way more fun than the island itself. On subsequent visits, I've found everybody absolutely loves this tour. Everybody likes Dolores Park, Twin Peaks, and a Giants game, but they all rave about zipping across the bay on Bay Voyager!

This is absolutely a must-do if you're visiting the Bay Area. You'll have a blast.<//review>

We had a fantastic voyage with Charles! We took an 11:00 trip around the bay with a boat full of friends. Charles knew many things about places all around the bay, it was so cool to learn about these seemingly secret spots! They just aren't things you notice from inside the city. It was a fun and exciting ride, we saw some amazing swells. Our Captain had a great sense of humor and was clear about safety and provided some much needed heavy weather gear along with our life jackets. They even validated parking and took some pics for us! A great experience, very personal and special. We will be back.<//Review>

Had a great experience. Beautiful weather, had the good fortune to see at least three whales close up. Captain was super knowledgeable about the local history and had a great attitude. Also got lucky and we were able to view a few naval vessels that had come in early for fleet week. Want to go again and would recommend to anyone. Oh also got to a pretty sweet view of the Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz!</text>

My coworkers and I decided to take the Bay Voyager cruise for our company team outing and we were all so glad we did. It was the best bay cruise (if you can call it that because it was so much more) that I've ever taken. A perfect mix between bay cruise, speed boat, and history lesson about San Francisco and its cast of characters. Captain Charles was so knowledgeable, kind, and accommodating and you could tell that he truly loves what he does. Next time I have have friends or family in town, this is the first tour I'll recommend to them!< /Text>

<review>We are locals to the Bay Area and absolutely loved this trip! We saw multiple whales on our tour, enjoyed seeing both bridges and AT&T park from the water. Captain Brian was such a nice guy and really personable. I would definitely recommend this tour to visitors and locals because it was such a fun trip.</review>< Name>

The best experience we have ever had in the SF Bay was with Captain Charles on the Bay Voyager. The boat is very fast and yet not bouncy in the water. We felt very safe at all times during our adventure. We wore rain slicker gear he provided and the provided life jackets, so we were warm and dry the entire trip. I would suggest one wear a sweatshirt at least, because out on the water in can get chilly. We learned many things about the Bay and its history, and saw beautiful sites up close that we never would have seen the same way on the larger tour boats. I and my wife can’t wait to return and take another trip. A highlight for me was seeing the Golden Gate Bridge from several spots underneath it, and also the bunker I never knew was at the East end of the bridge (opposite the City). Highly highly highly recommend this boat, trip and operator.< /text>

The captain is owner/operator of his boat, and it shows because his customer service is over the top!  He is friendly, courteous, accommodating, informative and entertaining.  The overall experience was the perfect blend of relaxation and thrill.  Exciting but not frightening.  Very interesting sights to see.< /review>

This tour of the bay is AMAZING! Captain Charles is incredibly passionate and knowledgeable about local history of all of the major sights. The views of the Golden Gate Bridge are stunning, and the Captain knows exactly when to pause for photographs. Our tour paused outside of the Giants Stadium during a baseball game. There really is no other tour of the bay like this. I highly recommend this memorable tour—I mention to all of our friends heading to SF.</Text>

I purchased my ticket from pier 39 I was originally wanting Alcatraz but they were sold out. It turned out to be the best thing because Captain Charles is Amazing and very knowledgeable of the area. He was very accommodating and made the whole ride fun. We went under the Golden Gate Bridge and out to the Pacific. We saw Lands end and many other great things. When I come back with my wife I'm definitely bringing her on Bay Voyager. Honestly, the best thing I did in San Francisco.<//review>

I purchased my ticket at the boat rides booth located in pier 39. They were very friendly and even gave us a deal on the last minute booking.

Once on fire dock,  it was top notch service through and through.  Captain Charles set us up with all the gear and warm clothes we needed.  Gave us a place to hold our belongings.  Even provided a charger for my phone.

Then the adventure began.  The RIB boat flew through the water.  The ride was much smoother than I expected and was absolutely exhilarating. It was like flying.  We were stuck with sweeping views of Alcatraz and the golden gate bridge

Perhaps the highlight was when we climbed the beakers underneath the bridge and headed out in to open water.   I've lived in the city my entire life,  and captain Charles showed us places i've never seen.  And many that I know well,  in very different ways.  He took stops along the way to share stories,  history and gave us a chance to take some amazing photos.

This trip is so worth the money.  I highly recommend it.  This is the highest rated boat tour in the city,  and that distinction is very well deserved.</text>

Bay Voyager is beyond 5 Stars! Great boat, great gear, and great Captain! A life-long Bay area resident, Captain Charles brings forward a much different telling of the sanitized historical fiction that is that unconsciously told by other tour operaters on the waterfront. Asking questions is highly encouraged. The watercraft only holds 12, so the group is small, and the boat can naviagte into corners of the Bay where no other boats can traverse. Recommend booking early as this experience sells out quickly!< /Text>

These guys offer a very unique experience on the San Francisco Bay water front.  The boat is a very professionally built piece of equipment and the safety gear provided for the ride is top notch. It is definitely worth a day to come and visit this company and see what they have to offer.< /Review>

Excellent boat tour. Fastest tour boat in the bay, so you see a lot. Captain Charles was great. Shows you lots of great sites along the bay, and he knows when to stop for photos. Would definitely recommend.< /Text>

<review>This was great.  The captain was very nice and gave alot of information.  I suggest this attraction to everyone that is coming to San Francisco.  I enjoyed this and the Alcatraz tour very much. But my stay at the Fisherman Wharf Inn on Mason Drive was terrible. Hotel was run down and nothing worked< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

Had a GREAT trip out into the gorgeous San Fran Bay with Capt. Charles! We learned a ton, saw incredible views of the coastline up close, and had a blast on the ocean waves! It was totally unique- and Capt. Charles shared his love of the city with all those aboard. Take anyone you can on this fantastic adventure on the Bay!</review>

Great experience for the whole family aged 9 - 59!

Given weatherproof clothing so kept dry and warm throughout. I learned lots about the bay and San Francisco. We were well looked after by Captain Charles!< /Review>

<review>My husband took me on the Bay Voyager for my birthday. We are new residents of San Francisco and it was AWESOME! I learned so much about the Bay Area and its history from Captain Mike! And we saw SO MANY WHALES! We were told this is a rarity so I consider us lucky. But it was amazing to go under the Golden Gate Bridge and through the different piers. We saw the sea lions, decommissioned ships and submarines, etc. HIGHLY recommend it both as a tourist and as a resident!<//review><user_name>Carlye Mitryk</user_name>< Pics>

<review>This was an awesome trip, approaching the Golden Gate Bridge in the fog and stopping right underneath to hear the creaking as the cars pass over head!  Brilliant.  Our host, Chuck, was so good, our friends from England thought that he was the perfect mix of knowledge, patience and enthusiasm.  Go on this trip!</review>< pics>

<Text>What an amazing way to spend a Saturday morning! We did the early bird trip on Bay Voyager and my 7 year old son talked of nothing else all weekend long. We are Bay Area residents and have done all the usual things: numerous trips to Alcatraz, taking the ferry between Oakland and SF, dinner cruises around the Bay, etc.  This was by far the best of the lot: the most exciting and the most fun! It was really different too, being in a smaller boat (they operate the same rigid-bottomed dinghies that are used by the coastguard and the navy) and feeling the waves under us as we rode out at high speed towards the Golden Gate Bridge, under the bridge and into the Pacific. We saw the San Francisco shoreline all the way around to China Beach and Land's End. Every now and then, the boat would stop and Captain Charles Jennings, who owns and operates Bay Voyager, would regale us with historical facts about the sights in front of us or some fascinating local lore. It was clear to us that he's a born native of the Bay Area who loves it deeply and knows it intimately. My favorite part of the trip (and that if my kids) was going under the bridge, and seeing it up close. When we circled back around, Captain Charles and Captain Brian took us in to where the sea lions where lying on their wooden flats, much to the envy of the onlookers lined up along the decks on Pier 39! Because of the size of the boat, we were able to see them at close range, particularly great for the kids! I liked the fact that they went in really slowly and quietly so as not to disturb the sea lions or scare the many sea lion pups we saw.

From the very beginning (the welcome, being outfitted with waterproof gear and getting our life jackets on) to the very end (disembarking and being bid farewell), it was such a lovely experience. The boat is very clean and the seats are comfortably cushioned. Captain Charles is gracious, considerate, experienced, great with kids (turns out he has a 5 year old son so he really relates well and understands how to put the kids at their ease) and has an excellent sense of humor. I would recommend this trip to locals like us, or tourists! We will have friends visiting us from Europe in the Fall and I'm going to book all of us on the longer afternoon ride. I know they and their two kids will love it, and we will be happy to do it with them!

I should mention that I forgot my cell phone in the pocket of the waterproof jacket that I was wearing. By the time I realized this and rushed back to the dock, Captain Charles and Captain Brian had put most of the jackets away in the locker. They very kindly took each one out and checked the pockets until they found my cell phone. I felt awful about putting them to so much trouble but they were super nice about it! Also, they take photos of you in the boat and you don't have to pay anything extra for these- really nice when you consider how much you get nickeled and dimed for every extra thing on some other rides.

TIP: DO wear layers! And even if it's a gorgeous sunny San Francisco morning, which it was when we went out yesterday, wear a hat or tie back your hair as the wind will rush by as the boat gathers speed. The hat or woolly head band will also keep your ears warm in the wind. And sun glasses are a MUST; we were all glad we'd taken ours. If the kids don't have any, they do have sets for them.

NOTE: My kids both loved this, and they are young! Bay Voyager takes safety very seriously and gives clear instructions. Kids do have to be 5 and older, though.< /Text>< pictures>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Whether tourist or local, exploring the Bay Area should be done by anyone in San Francisco, and with Captain Charles it will be a special experience. Extremely friendly, excellent local knowledge and absolutely safe navigation of the boat. We had unusually high waves, but felt very safe on board with Captain Charles, and at the same time the trip was great fun. We did the 1.5 hour tour, were behind the Golden Gate Bridge, at the sea lions and at the Giants Stadium (with many other stops). You can pester Charles with questions, he knows his way around. We will definitely go back to Bay exploring with him.

Ob Tourist oder Local, eine Erkundung der Bay Area sollte jeder, der in der in San Francisco ist einmal machen, und mit Captain Charles wird es zu einer besonderen Erfahrung. Überaus freundlich, hervorragende Ortskenntnisse und absolut sichere Navigation des Bootes. Wir hatten wohl ungewöhnlich hohe Wellen, aber haben uns bei Captain Charles an Bord sehr sicher gefühlt, und gleichzeitig hat die Fahrt großen Spaß gemacht. Wir haben die 1,5 stündige Tour gemacht, waren hinter der Golden Gate Bridge, bei den Seelöwen und am Giants-Stadium (mit vielen weiteren Zwischenhalten). Man kann Charles mit Fragen löchern, er kennt sich bestens aus. Wir werden auf jeden Fall wieder mit ihm auf Bay-Erkundung gehen.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

Year Round Heating and Air came out and installed a new Reem 16 seer A/C and heating system. They provided on the spot financing with very competitive rates and also provided us with two portable A/C coolers free of charge until our new system could be installed. Year Round Heating and Air was able to install our new system within two days of the service call and completed the install in one day. Their technicians are very professional and very courteous. I am very happy that I chose to do business with Year Round Heating and Air and would recommend their services to anyone. A very satisfied customer!< /Review>

<Review>Amazing service!! Very professional, they arrived at 7am and didn't stop working until I had cool air all over my home. I own a historic house and it was not an easy task but the guys worked with great attitude and kept my husband and I updated every step of the way. If you need A/C look no further,  Rafael, Otto and the whole team are the best!!</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<Text>Raphael and his team Miguel and Otto really proved they care about the customer and the experience. The real mark of a professional is when things do not go smooth at first but the company steps up and makes it right for the customer. Anyone can mend an A/C it takes a special group of people to mend a relationship with a customer and truly earn their trust. This company is truly about its customer and their needs. I will recommend them highly to anyone looking more than just an A/C repair.< /Text>< pictures>

<Review>Year-Around  has done work on three of my properties. They are excellent, very professional, and get the job done on time. The pricing is better than their local competitors, and the quality is better in my opinion.

Their level of customer service and professionalism is unmatched. I’m currently in the process of having my HVAC system repaired and we’re waiting on a part. Since my first encounter with this company yesterday,  I have been impressed. Both Rafael and Alverto were very courteous and respectful and arrived on time. They even brought me a portable AC unit to help cool my home until the parts needed come in from the manufacturer. Thank you to the team at Year Round! You made this ordeal a little easier to deal with.<//text>

I called for my AC unit going out, Jasmine answered and was very courteous and called me right back once she was able to confirm they had someone available for same day service. The technician, Rafael was right on time and quickly able to diagnose and fix my AC unit, had it up and running in less than 20 minutes. Very knowledgeable and professional. Good communication from the company via text message to keep me posted on the appointment time frame and when they were on the way. Would highly recommend!<//Text>

I’ve known Brandon for over almost 10 years.  Brandon has installed 4 units for me and has always been dependable.
However,  more than that, he’s been a solid family man and a good friend!

Our children go to school with one another, although my daughter isn’t supposed to know I included that.  😉

Brandon stands by his word.  He is a husband (ask his wife…. She always has a smile and is very sweet) as well as an amazing father!

Today, one of the Year Round Techs named Marvin, showed up on time.  He was greeted by myself and my two English Mastiffs.  Brandon text me as a heads up, to tell me that the tech was picking up the unit and heading my way.

Marvin showed up shortly thereafter and was very professional.

He was greeted by 400+ lbs of English Mastiff (Sherman and Denali) with open paws but made sure they told him “Hello”.  He let them slobber on him and did it with a smile and plenty of “ear and neck scratchins”!
Note:  Marvin actually kneeled down to eye level which really surprised me.

The external install was Immaculate!  Insulation that was paint worthy and all around SOLID job.

Thank you Marvin and thank you Brandon!

Solid work at a price that proves local small businesses are worth supporting!

Keep up the good work!

Informs and communicated as he works.
Honest and polite.
On point with his work.
Went above & beyond the call of duty.
Miguel was sweating.
More than reasonable in price.
Put booties on his feet to keep my home clean.
Kept his work area clean too.
Whats not to like about Miguel & Year Round!
They came on time, got the job right the first time, and earned my business going forward!
I am not easy to please.
God bless Miguel & Year Round!
As they continue to serve in His Righteousness, may they be blessed with good measure of business & overflowing.
Give Miguel a raise!</Review>

< Review>
I actually have a yearly maintenance package from another company that is supposed to give me priority for services. They said that they could squeeze me in on Friday—it’s Tuesday! There is a heatwave this week! I would have been a puddle on the ground or have burst into flames by the time they could get to me.

I searched online for an A/C company that was open 24 hours and found Year Round Heating and Air Conditioning. It was very easy to make an appointment. Ari (I think that was her name) was very helpful! I called around 8:45 PM and was given an appointment for 10 PM—the same night! I was sent a text that had all the details and a picture of the technician. I appreciated that information since I’m a single gal answering her front door at 10 PM at night!

Rafael arrived punctually at 10pm to fix my A/C system after calling and texting me when he was on his way. He was very professional and efficient. He fully explained what was wrong with my system and showed me pictures of electrical readings from my system. The accountability was awesome; he talked with me about my A/C system and answered all my questions. He definitely is a great technician who greatly cares about the job he does. I am now enjoying the cold air blasting in my house!</Review>

<Review>Thank you to Rafael and Miguel for coming by first thing in the morning to fix my AC. I first met Rafael for the diagnosis and he was very informative and honest in his analysis, showing me different values on his multimeter and what they mean. He laid out all the different repair/replacement options and the pros and cons associated with each of them. I did not feel intimidated or pressured to go with the most costly option or add any upgrades. The next day I was impressed and how thorough Rafael and Miguel were in their repairs. They went above and beyond my expectations and when finished, they cleaned up leaving no mess. All questions were answered thoroughly and professionally. I'm lucky to be part of their club membership so I have piece of mind knowing my family won't be without heat or AC outside normal business hours. I would definitely recommend their services to my friends and family!<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><gmap_id>0x80c351820a8ebbb7:0xf1563c1f8f459354</gmap_id>< rate>

<Review>The customer service and follow up was nothing short of excellent  and should be the template for any business. There is a saying if any company could give great customer service they would monopolize their industry. Year Round Heating and Air is on the way to monopolizing their  industry. While their pricing was very fair/competitive with full details of work being performed, people will pay more for good customer service because it is such as rare commodity.  My technician Rafael was courteous and professional. I been in the customer service industry for 30+ years and fully recommend Year Round Heating and Air Conditioning.<//Review></record>

<Text>Technician  Alverto arrived on time, performed his tasks in a friendly, efficient & professional manner. Advised me of a component which, although functioning was sub-par, expained the potential issues, & gave me the option of replacing the unit. I opted to continue with the unit as is,  and he returned the unit to the AC. I recommend Year Round and Alverto whole heartily.< /Text><user>103011107786524294286<//user>< username>

I called Year Round Heating & Air Conditioning at 10pm last night and was able to get someone out the very next morning. Rafael was AMAZING! He was super informative and as soon as he got here he knew exactly what the issue was and explained it to me thoroughly. He fixed it and my AC is back up and running. YAY!  I would recommend him and this company to anyone.< /text>

Thursday August 12, 2021 late afternoon. Ari exhibited professionalism and understood the urgency of my situation. After reviewing notes that Alverto (technician) had left from a previous visit to my home, she scheduled Alverto to my home with a 2 hour time block, same day appointment.  Thank you Ari!

Alverto (technician) arrived promptly within the time quoted, assessed the problem and made his recommendations. Again, I was totally impressed with this young man’s A/C knowledge and expertise. Alverto exhibited professionalism, patience and exemplary customer service. Thank you Alverto!

Saturday August 14, 2021
Rafael (supervisor) was awesome in reviewing and explaining the different cost packages for the Heating & Air Conditioning units needed for my home. My installation of A/Cs and furnaces were scheduled within 2 days. Rafael’s knowledge of the industry was very apparent due to his passion for what he does. Thank you Rafael for your professionalism and your patience!

Monday August 16, 2021.
Cuomtemo (hoped it’s spelled right), Otto
and Miguel, Year Round Heating & Air Conditioning installers arrived at my home on time, politely identified themselves, told me why they were here and promptly went to work. They were very hard workers, started early morning and continued throughout the night to complete the installation of 2 furnaces, 2 A/C units and 2 thermostats. Intermittently I would ask questions to each of them individually and without hesitation, they stopped what they were doing to answer my questions which was appreciated. Throughout the day/evening, they would advise of their progress and let me know when to expect the job to be done and would ask if I had any questions or concerns. They left the inside and outside of my home clean of any debris. All of their expertise and knowledge of their individual duties were exemplary to be such young men. Thank you Cuomtemo, Otto and Miguel!!!

Year Round Heating & Air Conditioning LLC, your employees are exceptional!!! I have worked in the customer service field for over 40 years and without hesitation, I would hire any of the employees I’ve had the pleasure of either talking with over the phone or meeting in person. They are a rarity to say the least. If they are a representation of all of your employees, I commend you as their employer!!! I will definitely recommend Year Round Heating  & Air Conditioning to my family, friends and neighbors!< /Review>

Great customer service from the whole team! Alverto was knowledgeable, friendly and personable, and delivered excellent service, beyond expectations.  We started the day with our 32 year old a/c not cooling; Alverto showed up within an hour of my call and had the problem  diagnosed and fixed an hour and a half later.  We knew that the system was on its last leg, so asked how quickly we could get a manager/salesman out here to discuss replacement.  Rafael showed up within an hour and we had a signed contract for a beautiful new system.  The crew showed up at 7am the next day, did an amazing install including all new ducts, cleaned up beautifully, and the job was complete by about 5pm!  We could not be more satisfied...5 Star service!</Review>

This company is just amazing. I had a few quotes for ac repair and this company was very honest, saving me a lot of money. They did a very thorough job...explaining everything every step of they way and answered all of my questions. They were also neat and professional. The best part is that for the excellent work done, the price is very affordable!</Review>

Excellent service from this company.  We had our ancient AC system die on us and worked with Rafael to get a bid on a replacement.  I did also check other Hvac outfits and Year Round was tops for price and delivery time.  We had Otto and Themo (sorry about spelling) come out and remove our old compressor and furnace and install new ones.  They were friendly, fast and explained everything.  I highly recommend Year Round.<//text>

< Review>
We contacted Year Round Heating after having a home inspection that required we repair our ducts in the attic. I spoke to Rafael and he came over to give us an estimate. He stated that the duct installation could not be repaired and had to be replaced. Since we had sold our house, he was able to get us a good deal on the ducts to replace our old ones. After the estimate, Rafael kept in touch with me the whole time. He told me that Devin would be the person to do the duct replacement and when he would arrive. When Devin showed up to do the work, he was prompt, efficient and clean. He covered our carpet so we didn't get all the old dust and parts from the ducts on it. After Devin was done, I received a call from Rafael again to check to see how everything went and to make sure I was happy with the work. Year Round Heating and Air did a fantastic job and the customer service is stellar. This day and age you don't find many companies that are customer service oriented. I am so pleased with the work they did and the customer service we received. We will refer them to family and friends.<//Review>

The company that I have used for years were unresponsive to my request for service. After looking into Year Round Heating & Air and speaking with Jasmine I decided to give them a try.  My tech was Rafael. He arrived on time and quickly solved the problem. He was professional and answered all my questions to my satisfaction. I will be using them again and recommend this company based on my interactions with both  Jasmine and Rafael.</Text>

Alverto did a great job of keeping me informed of his findings and the diagnostics he was doing to determine if there is a leak in my system.  He also reassured me that Year Round would get to the bottom of the issues that I have been having since my HVAC unit was installed ( by another company).
For the first time in 2 years, I feel like the issue will be resolved.
Alberto seems very knowledgeable and is extremely polite.

Our HVAC unit stopped working overnight. Year Round Heating and Air, LLC sent out Rafael, Field Supervisor, to our house within four hours. He promptly diagnosed the problem, fixed it right away and updated us about the issue. The price was reasonable. He came with with one other technician. Both were very professional and courteous. I would highly recommend them again. Thanks for your reliable and prompt service!</Review>

The team that came to my house for installation were very professional, kind, on time, with exponential customer service! If I could give 10 stars I’d give them 11. Wouldn’t have chosen a different group of guys to do this at all. To top it off it was completely finished in 3 days with nothing there. Highly recommended and will definitely refer this company to all my family and friends!!! Thank you!<//Review>

I was referred to Year Round H&A and from the first point of contact with Jasmine to the service repair technician Alverto, I say BRAVO! Jasmine was excellent with her inquiry of understanding my A/C leakage in order to send out a technician within hours of my call. She was courteous and professional. Thank you Jasmine. Alverto arrived within the scheduled appointment time and quickly assessed the problem. He explained what he needed to do for the repair in laymen’s terms which was appreciated. Alverto exhibited exemplary professionalism in his performance and customer service. Thank you Alverto. These two employees are an asset to Year Round Heating & Air Conditioning and I will recommend this company to those I know without any hesitation.< /review>

<review>Wonderful job, from initial inquiry about service to completion of job. Offered to repair the old furnace but recommended replacement...next day, everything installed to code (heater and a/c) in about 6 hours. No high-pressure sales baloney! Affordable payments! I'm so happy and the house is warm and comfy! Looking forward to lower electric bill come summertime! Very, very pleased with this company! So glad I found them!<//review>< pictures>

I had a major leak on my AC unit with no AC on the 4th of July weekend. Alverto responded to my address and identified the problem. After ordering parts needed for repair Alverto responded back to my address and completed the job. I want to thank Year Round Heating & Air for their excellent customer service and I would recommend them to anyone needing their services.  Duke Viveros (Dad) and daughter Madison Viveros.< /Text>

My name is Veronica, this is showing up under my husband's name... About a year ago our old HVAC was leaking coolant and was too old to be able to fix and keep. I called around and after getting a lot of questions with no solutions, no assistance and many "we'll get back to you's" I called this company. The technician that came out was Rafael, from the moment he stepped foot on our property I knew we were going to be taken care of. His professionalism and knowledge of the products were more than I was expecting. Even though at the time we couldn't get the full package, he made sure we had some kind of comfort in the blistering heat with our young child. At the end of the year we were able to get exactly what we needed, which came in handy with the cold that hit hard. Rafael and his crew came in and took care of business, only evidence they were in our home was the unit being relocated. They were very professional, courteous and had a great sense of humor. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for a company that takes care of you better than your own family. No other company is going to touch our system, we are very happy we found you guys. Thank you</Review>

<Review>Alverto Ramirez was my service tech. He came out to inspect and run a diagnostic on my AC unit which gave out two days ago. I’m a professional Union carpenter, and I personally take pride on details/specifics of job tasks. I also take pride on communication between the service personal and the client. Alverto did just that with me. He kept me informed showing me details of the issues, pointed out and gave alternative routes to fix the problems… He even went as far as educating me on specifics of tasks performing/services and best solutions.

This by far is the example one can appreciate from one professional to another. Thank you hear round and Alverto for a great exampleship of professionalism and quality customer service.

I just wish my landlords would’ve gave you guys the job for a full brand new install. Otherwise deff worth calling you guys for service<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>{'time': 1626977691659, 'text': 'Thank you very much for your review, sir.

<Review>Highly recommend.  Details below.

In sum, Year Round and it’s technician, Rafael Zaragoza, are a great service that offer responsive, complete, and reasonable maintenance.  Further, they are committed to the continued proper functioning of the HVAC systems.  I had gone around the block on HVAC repair and replacement before.  This was, by far, the best experience I have ever had.

I requested a quote through Yelp at the peak of the first really hot snap .  Twenty minutes after my online request, Year Round had me scheduled for a next day 8:00 am repair service call. I received a text the next morning notifying me of the imminent arrival of the technician, Rafael Zaragoza, who arrived dead bang at 8:00 am.  Within ten minutes, Mr Zaragoza had my problem diagnosed.  He further made sound recommendations for extending the life of the system.  These fell into high, medium, and minimal cost categories.   I followed the middle path of these recommendations.

So, in 45 minutes, the system was repaired, and a plan was in place to prevent similar outages.  Now, the cost.  It was remarkably reasonable.  The repair was a relay.  I did not have to replace either the coil or compressor.  I did sign up for the maintenance plan.  This, however, paid for itself, as one receives 20% discount on the repair upon signing up.

Well done to Year Round.  If you have a chance, request Mr Zaragoza.</Review>< gmap_id>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>Alverto Ramirez from Year Round Heating & Air Conditioning and his Co-Worker Miguel provided excellent service. Both were very respectful to myself and family. Both wore mask inside and outside of my home which is much appreciated during this current time. During the service Alverto called me over and explained the process of the maintenance of my A/C unit. He throughly explained what they were doing, how they were doing it and the benefits of it. Needless too say they earned the 5 stars and more. I also signed up for their companies program for maintenance and priority service. Thank you both Alverto and Miguel.<//Review>< Pics>

<Text>I found this company online a week ago, Year Round Heating & Air Conditioning llC, and I could not be happier with their great service. The company sent their technician, Miguel to our house and I was impressed by his proper personal protect equipment at this pandemic time. We needed our house a/c tune up. Miguel did the job as told, and he explained me the tune up process when it was needed. Miguel was super awesome, knowledgeable and friendly. I highly recommend this company for outstanding service!</Text>< Rating>

I found this company on thumbtack a few months ago, and I could not be more happy with their service. We needed to replace our furnace and compressor. Each time I contacted Rafael, he responded quickly and would come to our house within hours. Even on weekends!
As you know, these are not inexpensive machines, so we tried to go thru our insurance company first. Rafael helped us tremendously, as He personally spent HOURS dealing with our insurance company.
Year Round  has gone above and beyond for our family these past couple months, showing us the BEST customer service. Even better than Nordstrom’s 😉
I give them ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ and HIGHLY recommend for outstanding service.<//text>

Year Round Heating & Air Conditioning did an excellent job installing our new AC unit! The lady that answered my call was so kind and was quick to set up an appointment for me and wished me a blessed day. The technicians were quick to come check out the problem, diagnose, and replace unit. Rafael, Abraham, Devin and Miguel were professional, helpful and very knowledgeable. Thank you so much Year Round Heating & Air Conditioning for all the help and saving us from this heat! Totally recommend the company and we will be coming to you guys for the AC maintenance!</Text>

I reached out to several companies and they were booked for the next eight days. Year Round was able to send someone out to my residence in less than 48 hours and for half the price as compared to their competitors. Rafael was very professional, courteous and answered every question I made. I felt he was honest with the suggestions he gave me in order to get my AC up and running and in just 15 minutes my house was cooling down again. Going forward, I’ll be using them for all my AC and furnace needs.< /review><Date>1560539489213< /Date></record></dataset><record>

I can’t express enough of my appreciation for Year Round Heating & Air’s professional and excellent quality of service. From the person I spoke with on the phone, Ari, to the friendly and honest technicians who came, I was very impressed with all of them and how well they treated and communicated with us.

Our experience with this company started a few weeks ago when temperatures were at 116+ and our AC broke down. After calling over a dozen companies, only Year Round came in clutch for us and serviced our AC to get it running again the same day after hours past 9pm. Raphael and Miguel were so professional and honest. Our 20 year old HVAC system will need some major repairs and replacements so we decided to get estimates for a whole new system. We got several estimates and theirs was the most favorable quality package and value.

Today Devin and Vincent installed our brand new system and they did such a wonderful job with the installation in one day.  They were so helpful, honest and informative, explaining and answering all our questions. They prepped the carpet and floors with coverings to prevent soiling and cleaned up right after installation.  We are very confident we have a high quality HVAC system with very good warranties. We will definitely be their customer for life because of the integrity and quality of service they provided. I highly recommend them as you surely will be satisfied with their services from beginning to end. Thank you!!!!< /Review>

Greetings everyone, I have one word for this company, AWESOME! I appreciate Year Round Heating & Air's overall professional experience from beginning to end. They worked with me to pick the right system for my home and were able to offer a great deal. My system was installed the very next day. Devon performed an installation and was very dedicated ensuring that the installation was completed in the same day. Everyone I worked with at this company was very professional and went above and beyond to provide the best service. They took the time to answer all my questions and explain the system to us during installation. I would have no problem recommending Year Round Heating and Air.</text>

<Review>Year Round never seems to amaze me!

10:38 pm last night our AC stopped cooling when it was still 80 degrees outside, I considered waiting until morning to call the technician but it was getting really hot in the house, so I called their emergency line and left a message.

I received a call back immediately and was assured someone would be here shortly. Raphael arrived 30. min later and worked until our system was working. He finally left around midnight.

My roommate and I agreed that this is not normal! I loooove this company!!< /Review>< pictures>

This is my first time replacing my furnace and ac, I Google this company from Yelp. First I was skeptical because I have no idea about this company and about replacing furnace, but after reading the comments I give them a try. God sent me Rafael he is very knowledgeable about furnace and he even thought us about saving money. Rafael was very patience and thoroughly with us especially because we have no knowledge about this, he stayed until everything goes well and he makes sure we gets it. I have compared with others company and so far year round heating is the best and the staff is very patience and knowledgeable. The work is well done. I will recommend this company to my family and friends.< /Review>

We called Year Round Heating late in the evening to schedule an appointment for the soonest available appointment to have our heater repaired. . To our surprise the first available appointment was from 7am to 9am the following morning. Prior to 7am we received a notification that the technician was en route and arrived less than 30 minutes later. Prior to entering the house he put plastic booties over his work boots to not soil the carpets. He quickly diagnosed the problem and promptly repaired our heater. He took the time to answer our questions and explain every aspect of the repair. Rafael was very courteous, professional and personable.  We are very pleased with the service that we received and highly recommend Year Round Heating for your heating  and air conditioning needs. Thank you<//review>

I’m incredibly impressed with this company. My contact with them started with a phone call from Ari to set an appointment. I thought she was an owner because she was very personable and took ownership of the relationship with me and it put at ease.

I had appointments with 4 companies for quotes and this one was the last. Rafael came and he was the same as Ari. He was genuine, caring and it wasn’t forced or fake. All employees took ownership of their relationship with us. This spoke VOLUMES to me because this is not common for employees unless the owners have instilled it upon them AND the owner takes the same attitude with their employees as they expect their employees to do with their customers.

I decided that if they even came close to the other quotes (they were one of the best quotes for HVAC heat, air and filter) then we’d go with them because you can’t fake this, this is a company who truly cares and I was right as you’ll see….

I’m the caretaker for my 87 yr old mother and we were without heat. After financing was secured Rafael took it upon himself to expedite everything and make sure my mother had heat by the next day! He pushed the city to provide permits ASAP and had the team at my home at 7am the following morning! I was shocked because I didn’t ask him to do this. Again, this is the attitude that comes from the top, I call it ’trickle down mindset" in a company’s culture and they’ve displayed it beautifully in their care, attention to detail, swift action and taking responsibility for the customer.

The entire team from the first call to quote, installation and follow-through was stellar!

Thank you so much for the entire Year Round team!< /Text>

Rafael and Devin were great! After purchasing a new home we quickly realized the inspector missed some issues in the HVAC system that quickly needed to be addressed. We called Year Round and were able to complete a consultation over the phone same day to discuss our issue (very accommodating considering the Covid 19 crisis.) After recognizing the extent of the problem, Year Round had someone out that very afternoon. While the repairs were more extensive and costly than we hoped, we are extremely happy with the customer service and quality of work performed. We are so happy to know the work was done correctly the first time and appreciate the excellent level of communication from Rafael and Devin. Devin even took time at the end of the install to explain the system, expected maintenance, and answer any questions we had. We'll definitely be calling again for any future needs we have, although hopefully it's only routine maintenance 🤞<//review>

Outstanding company and service! Had an issue with our heater the winter, which ended up needing replacing. Year Round made sure we had heat that very same night, even though it was late into the evening already they came right out. You can really tell these guys care about the well being of their customers. Rafael is absolutely amazing and went above and beyond to help us, would recommend Year Round Heating & Air to anyone and everyone!< /review>

A huge thanks to Rafael who showed respect and professionalism on explaining our duct work and what was needed. Returning on the same day with Alberto the two quickly went to work and within hours made us proud new homeowners of quality and "safer breathing" duct work. We would highly recommend Year Round Heating & Air Conditioning, LLC to anyone looking for honest quality work at a reasonable price. Once again Thanks to Rafael for all his help in making us feel comfortable with the decision to have the work done.< /review>

from the receptionist to the representative they sent out to my home. They work very fast , pulled permits and changed out my old heating and air system for a brand new one!

I always dread when a repair technician arrives, as most want to sell new A/C units.  These units cost thousands of dollars.  All I want is to have it repaired & NOT be pressured to buy.  Rafeal DID NOT pressure me.  Rafeal and his partner Miguel were very informative.  Rafeal allowed me to follow him onto my roof to watch what he was going to do.  Everything, I asked of Rafeal & Miguel they did without reservation.  Rafeal was NICE enough to check all 6 of my capacitors.  The A/C’s capacitors & my extras.  Rafeal showed me with his electrical instruments that my capacitors were good.  Rafeal had Miguel check the compressor & explain to me how it works & how it’s broken down.  Rafeal MADE SURE he took his time to explain in detail how my 35 y/o A/C had finally died.  Rafeal explained how it might be impossible to get an original compressor and it’s cost.  Rafeal DID NOT try to steer me to an expensive unit.  My wife & I picked out an A/C unit that’ll work best for us.  Guess what?!  The A/C unit is HALF of what other companies want to charge.  My wife & I feel good about the decision WE made & the company Rafeal represents.  We WILL have a good, long lasting relationship.  Thanks for sending Rafeal.  I KNOW Miguel WILL pick up all the good people skills Rafeal has mastered.</Text>< Rate>

This company was absolutely wonderful. Rafael was so kind and very informative with what problem my central heart and air unit was having. I was  really scared about what it was going to cost to fix it. Rafael  felt my worries and called the owner and was able to do the job for the money I was able to pay. I will recommend this company to anyone and everyone for their excellent service and kindness.
RAFAEL...you are my hero. Thanks<//Review>

<review>Fast, friendly, knowledgeable, stellar service and great pricing! Our AC stopped working when we were having a heatwave in the IE!  Made a call and Rafa was out on the same day and checked what was going on and after checking the unit it turned out we needed a new unit.  The pricing was reasonable and a couple of days later he was back replacing our unit.  Rafa and his co-worker were here late but they got the job done and now we will be staying cool throughout this summer and the summers to come...

Highly recommend Year Round Hearing and Air Conditioning. I had shopped around with different companies and Year around was by far the most competitive in prices.  Gave them a call on a Friday afternoon. Our unit had completely gone out and needed a new one. By Monday afternoon brand new unit was installed and running. Fast and friendly service from the technicians as well. Rafael is great tech.<//review>

Thank you so much Year Round for your outstanding customer service. Raphael I can not thank you enough for the hard work and effort you put in towards meeting our needs. You worked effortlessly fixing a situation day in and day out until we were completely satisfied and I must say I am overwhelmed and in awe of how professional this company was to us. Raphael was completely professional from the moment he stepped foot in our house till the very last day, having him around felt like having an additional family member in our home. 😁Thank you for carrying us as your #1 priority while trying to satisfy so many others. I will share my experience with everyone I know!< /review>

Rafael was there when we need the heater and he knows what he’s doing to replaced our heater unit. He was dedicated very well for his company job. I recommend Rafael for any furnace need and he’s the best.<//text>

I have to commend Year Round Heating and Air Conditioning for being a company that constantly wants to make sure their customers are satisfied. If a problem arises, they make sure to address it  immediately and do not stop until you are satisfied.  I had a minor issue with the company and once I addressed my concerns they immediately called me and made sure everything was 100% fixed.</Text>

Good evening the only reason why I'm giving this rating is because I was reimbursed for an estimate and a trip charge that I was told there were free estimates from the beginning and I have a screenshot to prove it from the customer service manager or technician that book the estimate trip I was a little bit uncomfortable with the diagnosis that Raphael gave and so I seek to seek a second & third opinion and or go through my home warranty company who I found out while the technician was here covers everything thanks for your time and have a great evening. The employers technician came back out and sent his technician on November 19th around 5:30 p.m. they corrected the bill invoice issue and zeroed out and did the service complimentary to me for all of the confusion so I receive the free service to my unit and I appreciate them correcting the issue and servicing my unit. Thank you. 12-05-19.
Thank you for returning and completing the job have a great evening<//review>

Rafaeal did a excellent job on my Central Heating.
I found him very knowledgeable and immediately pinpointed the problem and fixed it.
He was on time for the appointment and he had to make 2 trips to my house.
I would definitely recommend him to my fellow investors.</text>

< review>
Working with Year Round has been great, just moving to the area and being very unsure of where to go for different services, from the first engagement I didn't feel like I was going to be taken for a ride. We negotiated  a very fair rate, about the cost of lunch money  for a week :-) to have 2 thermostats replaced and keep me from freezing at night. I'd like to thank Raphael in particular for being on time, friendly, professional and still getting the work done quickly.< /review>

I initially called them to troubleshoot a heater issue. Rafael impressed me with his professionalism that I asked about replacement costs and decided to take advantage of winter rebates. He and his crew replaced our 2 flakey 4 ton systems in less than a day, start to finish, after promising 2 days.  The Rheem replacements are so much quieter and cost quite a bit less than what I was planning on having to spend. Can’t wait for summer to enjoy the AC.  Wish I’d found this company sooner.

Very happy with the system 18 months later.  Miguel just finished our first maintenance, now that we're not as worried about covid.  Great company and people.<//Text>

<text>Raphael and his crew did an outstanding job adding insulation in the attic, installing a new attic fan, and installing new duct work. Our family was extremely happy with the price and quality of his work, and we look forward to recommending him to our friends and family in the future.

< Review>
Thank you Rafael and Year Round Heating and Air for LYING.
I was promised a gift card IF i have a 5 star review.
Truth be told, this company is TERRIBLE.  Rafael came out on a service call yesterday to take a look at my heater.  HE WAS TWO HOIRS LATE. THERE WAS NO CALL TO UPDATE HIS TIME.

THIS COMPANY LIES.</Review>
<Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1583463923883, 'text': 'Hello Angelica, our office tried contacting you today to see how we can make this better for you.\nWe don’t have any recollection or records of a technician going out to your home on March 3rd. We do apologize for any confusion. The only record that we have is for a diagnostic on January 15th.\nWe are so sorry that you had to change your review, two months later from a five star to a one star.\nOur notes do show that our technician was a little late due to excessive traffic. It does tend to happen from time to time, but we try our best to be punctual and give a reasonable timeframe.\nThere is a record on our database of outbound calls from the office updating you on his time of arrival. We would be able to send that your way on a more private note.\n\nSubsequent to our technician arriving at your home, he requested to have your diagnostic fee waived in an effort to compensate for his tardiness. Your diagnostic fee request was approved and your diagnostic fee was waived. No other work was performed in you home.\n\nWe would never pressure anyone into giving a certain number of stars. We did have a promotion that lasted for only one month, where we would send out a gift card for a review but even if it was a one star, which if you can recall correctly you did receive. As a company we would never persuade anyone or force them to give us a five star. I do see that you had given us a five start initially and when the gift card got delayed you changed it to a one star. I do apologize for that inconvenience. Please let us know if there’s anything that we can do for you.\n\nWe thank you very much for your feedback and hope to be able to make it better for you. Please do call us with any further concerns that you may have.'}< /Resp>< GmapID>

<Review>We were quite amazed at the quality, professionalism, knowledge, and cost of the service that Year Round Heating and Air Conditioning company provided. It was a God Send to have someone (Rafael) come into our home and offer a product that we REALLY needed and felt VERY comfortable about our purchase with no second guessing. The complete in’s and out’s were explained to us in terms we understood. Rafael didn’t even mind my wife’s craze of a million questions.

Immediately after instillation, the guys were considerate in making sure our home was left in the condition they found it, no mess no footprints or handprints anywhere.They tested
the system and DOUBLE WOW, we felt an IMMEDIATE POSITIVE change in this products performance. We look forward to the energy and money saving benefits that this system will provide. We learned so much useful information from Rafael regarding energy efficiency.

We wish we could afford to Bless you with a heating and air condition system from Year Round Heating and Air.

We pray for God’s Grace and Blessings upon this company and its staff. We encourage you to  looking into updating or purchasing your system with NO ONE ELSE.

In Faith and Appreciation

< review>
Professional and courteous service. Responded quickly to my quote and complete the service faster than expected.

I had a duct with restricted airflow and an overflowing drain pan.

Told me exactly what was needed to inspect/repair and kept me posted throughout the entire process.  He also gave advise to maintain the system.

Would definitely return for future service.</review>

<text>This was my second time with Ultimate.
Eddy did the first check and visit. He was very nice.
Nevertheless, Ezer, the owner, finally repaired it. He was nice, quick and extremely knowledgeable, AS ALWAYS.
And also, last but not least, Jennifer, the lady over the phone who I never met in person, was AWESOME ! Super kind and warm, also very qualified and helpful.
VERY much recommended !!<//text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

<Text>Eddie knew immediately how to fix my air conditioner and he was so kind.  I greatly appreciate that he took the time to wear protective gear, (mask and gloves) and he was very patient with all my questions.  He fixed the issue and did a full service check.  I am grateful to Home Advisor for making Ultimate Air Conditioning Inc. the perfect choice for any future A/C needs.

< review>
Ultimate Air saved the day for my family.  We moved into a new home and a week in the HVAC dies.  We had another company in that we had previously dealt with and they would only talk to us about a complete replacement.  They took over 36 hours to get back to us with pricing.  The quote from that company was $13K!  We promptly called Ultimate Air which is now our first call always of course.  They came the next day and suggested various options of which was also replacement within moments of the end of house call.  In the end we decided to replace the system, because it was old and it made sense.  Ultimate's quote was way less and so reasonable.  They were quick to get back to us on all fronts and a pleasure to work with.  You can image July in the valley not being the time to wait on an HVAC install.  They came the day after I approved the estimate to eye ball where the crane would park, and they were back the following morning earlier than their 8 am call time.  They made everything painless, including having a crane come to put the unit on our townhouse roof!  I truly felt like they wanted to help, and would do anything to make it all happen as quickly as possible.  I cannot say enough good things about this company and everyone I dealt with.  They should be your first and last call.< /review>

<Review>Definitely will call any time I need a repair. These guys are transparent and honest, patient and thorough.

Our condo has some wonky issues, what would be a simple DIY install always ends up being an 8hr goose chase that requires professional attention.

Our AC setup was no different but these guys patiently helped solve the mystery with us over 3.5hrs. While understandably they could have left once things were up in running, instead they also took the time to make sure everything was in 100% working order.

(P.S. Also very respectful of Covid-19 safety)< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

I had a technician come out to replace my old mercury switch thermostat. After he got started he discovered that at some point one the the safety features of the unit had been tripped which meant the thermostat was not communicating to the actual unit. Once he tracked down the problem he fixed it and didn’t charge me any extra. I will definitely call them if I have any problems in the future.<//review>

My air conditioning unit  was acting up. Called a few other companies they could not get to the bottom of what was wrong.  They all suggested to buy a new unit. Keep in mind the unit is only 2 years old. Luckily i found Erez / Ultimate Air on Google. this was the only company to actually figure the problem out this saved me a lot of $$$. Very professional and knowledgable priced well. Highly recommended.<//Review>

<review>Ultimate Air Conditioning and Erez are amazing! After numerous unprofessional or overpriced estimators from various companies we choose Ultimate Air Conditioning to revamp our heating and A/C work done improperly by another contractor in 2011. We were referred to Erez by an Engineer friend in December, 2017 who told us that Ultimate Air Condition had a very reputable reputation for honesty and hard work. Not the cheapest and certainly not the most expensive. Just Fair pricing for intelligent, well thought out hard work.

Erez promptly arrived for his estimate and gave us the confidence in his ability do do the job. He came up with better alternate designs which even the largest corporate estimators missed. Many HVAC companies have little interest in smaller jobs or use scare tactics to convince you they are your heroes. Erez and his crew arrived on time with email and text notifications detailing estimated arrival times. Even signing the digital contract to commence work was convenient.

Approximately a two and a half day job, Erez neatly installed the new duct work for more even distribution and came back to make any necessary adjustments as needed. Erez and crew are polite, very hard working and professional. He was also very helpful in finding a solution when it was discovered that copper piping was in the way of a new duct that needed to be installed. They always swept up and left the construction debris cleaned up at the end of each day. They truly went above and beyond.

I typically never pay for a job until completed, but in this case when a return air box being built offsite was delayed a couple of days due to the Holiday, I still paid in full once the main job was completed. That is the level of trust which I placed in Erez. There are many "hit and run" companies which overcharge or never come back when there are issues. We have renovated dozens of homes throughout the years and have nightmare stories with other installers. Erez and Ultimate Air always returned when stated to complete the job.

Whether zoning, or installing complete new systems, Ultimate Air Condition is the go-to company recommended by many Realtors and satisfied customers. With neat installation, fair pricing and professionalism, my wife and I absolutely recommend Ultimate Air Conditioning.</review>< pics>

They have speedy attentive service,  tastefully fresh food, great portions, nice priced specials, and friendly staff.  This place is a prime example of 5 stars. I only advise to not going during "hot" hours because they'll be packed.</Text>

I ordered the veggie omelet well done, with jack cheese and their homemade potatoes. I had the rye toast , jam and some decaf. My order came and the omelet was perfect. I had a side of salsa to complement my meal. The size of the omelet was too much, so I packed the rest of my breakfast to go...for later. This place is becoming my place to go to for breakfast,  and they provide good service. Thanks. You can't go wrong by stopping by this place.

<review>I've heard nothing but good things about the food from The Corner Café and after finally visiting, I was not disappointed at all! I was sat at the bar area in front of the kitchen and I really enjoyed plotting what I was going to order the next time I'd come around hahaha
Everything looked so good! The staff was great too, very professional and interactive. Team work makes the dream work; it was nice to see them all smiling and having a great time at the workplace. Will definitely be returning!!!<//review><GmapID>0x80952f9ea08e834f:0x27de00be193d55</GmapID><resp>None<//resp>< Pics>

Been here before they relocated, it was a good place but my last experience was awful. Made us wait for hours but they had no problem letting other families that only waited minutes to b seated. Then with many open seats available they stuck us way in the back by the bathroom talking about that's all they had available, I know we r practicing social distancing but there was tables open that where designated for seating. This cafe's service is excellent to it's white customers as I witnessed, so if u brown it's best u don't come around. I would leave negative stars if I could</Text>

<Text>The waitress was not wearing her mask and she brought her food to us after she talked to some people for a while while she was breathing all over the food.I explained to her that it wasn't personal but and this time of the covid-19 it's important for food servicers to have a mask on so they will not infect the patrons.after I politely asked her to take it back and bring me some more food with a mask on .she took the food back and then another waitress told me that I could just leave the establishment because the other waitress had an infection couldn't wear the mask. So the waitress just informed me that they will not be serving me and I should just leave.I will not come back to this restaurant again and I will tell all my friends and family to do the same and I will start a campaign to systematically let all of Visalia know not to come back to this restaurant because this restaurant does not have our medical interests in mind and it is a covid-19 super spreader thank you<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

<Review>This is a great place. We used to go here when it was on mineral King. Now it is around the corner from my house so it is a great convenient breakfast place.

It is very busy on the weekends and especially on holidays. I have always had good service and the ladies have always been very nice and friendly. We often go for my kids birthday breakfast and they treat them very well. The food is delicious and fresh and the portions are huge. It is always very clean.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Service is courteous and prompt. If you're coming in around 1030 to 11 am it will be busy so expect a 15 minute wait for food. The eggs were standard for a cafe slightly fluffy but also dry. The eggs could use a little butter or creme fresh nearing the end of cooking to be knockout food. The bacon was crisp and was oven cooked and into the fryer. You can taste a little bit of the frying oil. I also sampled a 1/2 waffle, it was excellent and it paired with the syrup wonderfully. The waffle was fluffy, absorbent, and had a flavor of vanilla to it. Expect to pay 10 to 14 dollars a plaque for a plate. The coffee was 2.75.  They do offer "cappuccino" which is a flavor mix. Overall if I had extra money and wanted to go out for breakfast, I would definitely come back.</Text>

Would be nicer if place was open longer hours and in a bigger building.

The atmosphere is a 50's theme is i wonder why they didn't take over Merrill's Drive-In so to keep it family owned...?</Text>< Pictures>

Nice place, prompt service. Gives a comfortable 70’s feel. Lots of options for omelettes, burgers and sandwiches. Moderately priced.</Text>

<time>1573688429268</time><rate>5<//rate><Text>Everything is true. All of it. After hearing rave reviews about this cozy spot, I finally checked it out for myself and was not disappointed. Late breakfast during the week, so not much of a crowd. I sat at the counter and watched as the waitstaff greeted almost every customer by name AND knew their drink orders. My order came quickly and before the plate was down in front of me, my waitress turned right around and gave it back to the kitchen because she noticed it was wrong.  She took the extra effort to make sure my food came out exactly how I wanted it with no fuss. The food is down-home traditional diner food and so, so YUMMY!</Text>< pictures>

Great!!! We went there twice and both times it was very good. A lot of food. If you have a big appetite go there, even if you don't go there anyway maybe you can split a plate. Good service and good food.</Review>

TCC is my "go to" for a meal that is next to home cooked! They treat you like family, maybe because it is a family run business. Breakfast served all day! Or...until they close at 130 PM.< /Text>

Paid $13 for a "Full size" chicken salad and when I received it, it was nothing but what they advertised. It had old lettuce a couple slices of cucumber and what looked like maybe a piece of chicken tenderloin, if that on it. Will never go there again<//text>

<review>If you're a breakfast person this is a must. By far the best breakfast in Visalia. It's nothing fancy just good old fashion home style cooking.

<Text>We've always received great service with the friendly atmosphere but the last two times the service seemed off and slow some how. I thought maybe they had some new employees but that wasn't it. It took way too long to get our orders taken and the serving of the breakfast was even slower. We really enjoy going to the Cafe and won't give up on them. I'm just hoping it's just a phase they'll come through and return to being the greatest.< /Text>< userid>

Dennys level prices but far better quality. Staff is quite friendly. I would definitely recommend.
Though, their parking lot is a little lackluster, it's almost better to park at save mart and walk a little bit to get there.<//Text>< Pics>

Order through Door Dash; never again. Their price verses Door Dash was 13 dollars more. No one ever called me to verify whether or not I authorized the higher charge. Tried calling Corner Cafe; good luck ever getting through on the phone. hmm, convenient!!! I sent a Facebook message with both their receipt and the Door Dash receipt. Their response was Door Dash messed up our prices. Ya right, as if Door Dash sets pricing for Corner Cafe. Even if, how does it become my probably! Furthermore, they charged me for an extra side, which I did not order nor is the side in my Door Dash receipt. additionally, Door dash states cash tip, but Corner Cafe charged me a tip.

Besides Corner Cafes unauthorized charge to my debt, which I will be disputing the food sucked.< /text>

But the last time my family and I came in it was awful. They messed our order up on more then 3 items waffle had a huge black hair stung across it. Food sat in window for along time it came cold to the table. They charged a gratuity on partys over 6. Even though we came in at different times and split the check according to family. They didn't earn the gratuity. The quality was bad and service was not efficient.< /text>< pics>

Love this place.  Great casual "Hot Rod" themed breakfast and lunch spot.  The food is always fresh and good, and service is always upbeat and pleasant.  Yes, this is the original Corner Cafe that was originally on E. Mineral King Ave.  If you've never been there, go, its a great place.< /Review>

Impressed with quality of food and service. Bacon was topnotch, hashbrowns as good as you can get, biscuits and gravy will bring you back for more. Old style Diner.</text>

Followed them from their old location to here, in the neighborhood. Great food and people. Don’t get there as often as I like. The word has spread. And they are quite popular. Look forward to my visit.<//Text>

Very friendly is all I can say. My pancakes was cold, my omelette not cooked all the way, and the waitress was to busy to get to my table on time. If you like a friendly atmosphere this the place but for the food I don't recommend coming.<//review>

If I could  give 0stars I would by far the worst place I have ever went and been treated so disrespectful from our waiter to management very rude and for all that and the food was cold and spent over 50 for our group! Please learn better customer service you list my family friends and me and a customer and I will tell everyone I know about the horriable service I received and no apologies were given the manger was even worst than our waiter</text>

And the food!!  Simply amazing.  I loved the waffles, and after sampling my wife's biscuits and gravy, and her omelet, and her diced potatoes, onions, etc...  the waffles (that were amazing) were the worst part of the meal.

Favorite breakfast place in Visalia.< /review>< rate>

Best breakfast place in all of Visalia hands down. Great food, great value and great service. When you come here, the owner Sharon, is always there and is likely refilling your cup of coffee! If that isn't hands-on running a business I don't know what is.< /text>

<text>This place is interesting. I stopped by here while visiting my family and it’s a diner dive for sure. Things you need to know?

The food will be greasy.
The portions are ridiculously big. I had a sausage patty that bigger than my hand spread out.
The booths are large and comfortable.
You need to take your ticket to the front to pay.
The servers are friendly and bring coffee around often.
There is cream on the table and most of it is flavored.
Everything is red.</text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

The place looks nice. Still waiting for our food. We came in and got our drinks then they seemed to forget we were there. We finally had to flag someone. Then they had to find someone else. When a waitress showed up there was no apology for the wait.  She almost seemed to resent that we were there. I hope the food is good...

Once our waitress decided that we were hers she was good. The food was fair.< /Review>

I have been a fan of the home made sausage patties for almost 5 years.
Although ---
The recipe ALMOST SEEMS to be the same, except it's missing those key little ingredients that use to set it apart from the rest. The patty I was served was  a little dry,  thin and flat instead of thick & juicy with visible "seeds & spices" .
The original taste and Quality has gone down and
Their prices have gone up since they moved over to this new location.
Average cost of a basic plate for breakfast , a
The License Plate Wall is how my kids know this place. It is big, clean and just a really nice comfortable atmosphere unless you sit at the diner style counter.
There's alot of movement and noise due to the waitresses picking up their orders.
So it's not the best place to sit if your reading something. Another thing that has changed is the biscuits and gravey.
Biscuits are NOT HOMEMADE anymore.
Salsa has changed and tastes like a glop of squished can tomatoes.</review>

Last time I was here was many moons ago and it was still by the DMV and swamped and was like being at a concert but sitting down and enjoying food.

Their new spot is quite roomy, modern and not cramped but still as busy.

The food was just as good as when I last tried it. I had a cup of coffee, ham and eggs. Everything was cooked just right and the eggs were just like I like them. And more important the flow of coffee was never ending.

Service I’ll have to admit was much more improved compared to my last visit and that could be because it’s not so cramped at their new location. It was quite nice and I’ll be sure to make my next visit not so distant.<//text>

This was one of the blandest poorly served meals I've ever eaten. I really didn't enjoy the food what so ever. Do not order Jose's omelette it's an upset stomach waiting to happen. I took two bites and I was done for good. The food is very cheaply made and on top of that the service wasn't very great. The waitresses weren't very polite to begin with. My entire family had the same opinion on the bland and flavorless food as well as the rude staff and we agreed to never return to this location again. This restaurant takes the 'worst experience' trophy from us.<//text>

Horrible food went with family waited a long time i said we should have went to black bear the waitress over heard me say got upset and told me maybe i should just go to black bear i wanted to get up and leave but like i said i was with family everyone got there food then the waitress comes says sorry you should have went to black bear we burnt your chicken😲 at this point i was feeling real uncomfortable then may plate came dry chicken and a soggy waffle did not want to upset the fam so i tried eating it just thinking the whole time what did they do to it? Never going to corner cafe again!! Going to Dimples Diner the old cook who used to make the best breakfast at kats corner works here now corner should have paid him better😃< /Review>

Attended on 2 ocassions as this establishment is the local for my family who love in Robey Street. Whilst visiting from NZ my family made it clear if you want great kai (food) and amazing personal service...don’t ever go past this place. They were absolutely right!! You need to open up a branch here in NZ so we can enjoy your amazing high quality meals along with your even more amazing high quality service. You Aussies are certainly winning on this one!!< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

Finally got to eat breakfast without having to stand in line. Got the last Table.   great food. Hot toast.<//Review>

<resp>None<//resp><Pics>None< /Pics><text>I was very unhappy with the all around experience I had today. It took a long time for someone to take my order this morning and even longer to get my food. I saw it was in the window for them to pick up almost 5 min. I'm shocked it was not cold. The food was overcooked the gravy was runny with very little flavor and I never received the toast I ordered. They asked how the breakfast went and I told them exactly that and all they said was sorry, Did not even get a manager to talk to me. This will be the last time I go there. also everyone was more worried about talking then serving.  This is the second time I've been there and a bad experience on both counts. if any asked me about this place I will tell them the truth about my experience. I do admit the other place where they were at it was tons better (night and day)<//text>< user_id>

Went in today, seated after short wait. Three tables seated after us all had their orders taken. Completely ignored! Sat for 20 min before walking out.

We usually eat at counter with great service and food.

Today was horrible!</Review>

The staff here is nice, happy, and very personable. The food options are vast, and the portions are huge. You could get away with ordering one meal and to people sharing it.</Review>

Okay, I have only eaten at the new location 3 times. The first time it was really good. The last 2 times food was practically burnt and as a former professional cook I don't believe their cooks keep the grills wiped down. Too much black particles come with your order and to top it off, gets to your table cold.<//text>

As a first time visitor of Visalia, I was pleasantly surprised to find a spot like the Corner Cafe. The food was good, the portions were large, the service was quick, and the restaurant wasn't too loud. Pretty hard to go wrong with that!</review>

I always watch to see which restraunts contractors, farmers, and blue collar families frequent. And the Corner Cafe is one of these gems. Great Food, Great Service, Great Prices. The restraunt is open for breakfast and lunch. Bring your appetite, and try the Meat Loaf special on Wednesday's. The location can be hard to recognize your first time. As you head North on Akers, past the National Guard Armory the restraunt is on the side of the shopping center facing Akers. Parking is tight, and you may need to park a little ways from the restraunt.< /text>

Dont reccomend taking toddlers here. The older waitress will treat them like an inconvenience.  My toddler and I were treated like we were below her standards. Yes the breakfast is good and I have ignored the not so satisfying service here for a while but I'll have to draw the line when a grown woman is rude to a 2 year old.<//Text>

The following other local business owners just love to have great customer service and support for the amount of food you are buying the price of the meal is worth much more than anyone is paying for it.

Here it goes! My wife and I were excited to eat here today from all that we heard. However..... I am sorry to say that it was highly overrated and not a good experience at all.
Line of people waiting to be seated and of course I understand due to the grand opening, but...
1,) They forgot to write my name down and after waiting for some time and noticing people going before us I checked their list and my name was not written down? bummer..had to wait and get worked in.
2.) Took quite a while for someone to offer us drinks. waitress finally came to our table and informed us that she would be back to take our drinks...waited again.
3.) Waitress brought our drinks and left very fast... we did not have a spoon to stir our coffee because we had no silverware? It took a while in being able to get a waitress attention to get silver ware. They were very nice, but looked overwhelmed and there was no flow to their service?
4.) Finally the waitress took our order and informed us that she would send someone over to refill our coffees..(because they were empty?) I appreciated this however this did not happen? I had to flag her down again and acutally asked her to promise to get us a coffee refill because she would say something and rush off... Not feeling very confident that she would  make it happen?
5.) After some time... I think they forgot to bring our food when it was done because when it finally arrived it was cold. Not even luke warm. We did not have the nerve to discuss this with anyone as we did not want to bother them any more as our confidence level in their service was very low.
6.) Midway through our meal we noticed that they had not brought all our food? I again had to flag down the waitress who speaking very loud that she had brought what we ordered until I showed her the receipt (which she dropped off at our table when the food was delivered) Then she acknowledged that our order was shorted. I asked her if we could get it to go?
7.) A waitress brought the remainder of our food to go in small containers with no bag? We had to carry the containers and did not have the nerve to flag down another waitress to ask for a bag?
8.) We then went to the front to pay the ticket and the register was set up 3ft. in front of waiting to be seated area so you had to literally stand with your butt in someones face to pay your tab? Not comfortable. Nor when I was waiting to be seated (for some time) having peoples butts in my face? LOL..
9.) Also.... when paying your bill on their fancy IPAD type register it does not allow you to put the amount of tip on it? It starts off with a 15%, 25% or 35% button????? or a "no tip" which I don't believe in, but would have liked to have left a tip appropriate to the level of service I received? so I hit the 15% button because it was the lowest and I think is a  bad practice for controlling the amount of tip a customer leaves. (I do believe you shold always tip) but, a tip should not be controlled by the vendor?
Summary,
Nice people, No flow of service, food not that great,(maybe better if hot?) Not a good dining experience.... My wife informed me that she wanted to eat at Corner Cafe because it would blow Country Waffle and El Rosals away...(where we normally eat breakfast) Sorry to say.. Not even close... sorry, but I am a big fan of honest reviews and places of buisness need to know that service is a large part of business. I hope management reads this review and hope it helps them to restructure or make the changes needed to improve the service and live upto their reputation of being a good place to dine at? Service, Service, Service.... Get it?

There is a saying... The floor is a reflection of it's leadership, so whomever the leader is needs t read this and take full responsibility... I believe the staff was unprepared and need support.

Just so you know.... I fully understand customer service and best practices along with lot's of travel in what I do which does allow me to benchmark my experiences on dining out.
Yours truly..VOICE OF THE CUSTOMER!</Text>
