This is for selling. The majority of what I couldn’t sell at the plato’s closet in San Jose, this one took. Haven’t purchased anything here yet. But highly recommend selling here< /Text>

<user>110687512947726734065< /user><Review>Made an appointment to sell some items in January and that appointment was schedule for mid February. I was notified a few days before my appointment that they had to cancel it and reschedule it and the earliest available was a month later. Just received a call that my appointment was cancelled again. All of these cancellations wouldn't be so bad if they could reschedule you for a reasonable time but at this point I'm probably looking at another month or two. I'm just going to send my stuff to thredUP and save myself the headache.<//Review>< Time>

<pics>None</pics><review>After my mother passed away I took some of her used clothing items into this store to sell. The miserable, heavy-set woman (who said she owned the place) actually had the audacity to accuse me of stealing the items. I was already upset because of my mother’s death but this was more upsetting than I can convey. I left and took the items to “The Cat’s Meow” located 2 blocks away at 601 Lighthouse Avenue. The nice lady that owned that store treated me fairly with kindness and respect.<//review>< gmap_id>

Also, don't bother taking your clothes there to sell, they are so picky. Out of an entire garbage bag of clothing that I took, they were willing to take 1 thing and gave me maybe $6 for it. Waste of time if you have even decent name brand things, in my opinion.<//text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Which makes it hard to do when you work all day and they don't buy clothes after 4pm. They ususally give good rates for clothes too, considering I would normally just throw away/donate old clothes. And they clothes that they dont buy from you, you can just take across the street to goodwill to donate.<//Review><Response>None</Response>< UserId.>

Awesome place for clothing, shoes, accessories and more.
It's a great place for your pre- teen, teen or for any young adult who wants to be trendy and get things in great condition and you won't have to spend a lot of money. Great prices.
Great selection of girls and guys fashions and accessories like jewelry, purses, hats, bathing suits and boots and shoes. They also have a large selection of sweaters, jackets and coats.
Everything has a many size selections.  The staff were extremely helpful and friendly.
We are going back again soon.
We loved it. I highly recommend Plato's Closet.< /review>

Although Plato's certainly has a good amount of trendy and current outfit options, I feel that they could expand on the male section a bit. The store itself isn't very large, which results in about 2 short aisles dedicated to what people might generally recognize as male outfits.
That said, they have a good selection of women's shoes and sunglasses, kind and helpful staff, and a decent property location. Have fun!</review>

So very dissapointed with Platos Closet Monterey. Prices have gone up extremely. Also changed their return policy NO RETURNS all FINAL SALE. Most Sweaters were 16 dollars and up!!! I used to love this place because of the low prices, not anymore.< /Review>

<Text>Neat little place to sell your clothes. Of course your not going to get rich selling, but hey it's a business, and you get a few bucks in return for stuff you were probably going to donate anyways. They mostly have women's clothing, but there's a decent smaller section for guys. Good place to find some the stuff you'd see at the Del Monte Center, but for less! Note there's a cutoff time for them to purchase clothing, about an hour or so before they close. Just call to verify it ahead of time. Check it out!<//Text>< gmap_id>

There are several other local consignemt shops in the area I would recommend over this one.< /Review>< Name>

<review>I gotta say that this place is not worth the drive and gas money. I have been here quite a few times and the same lady is always working. I brought in a bag of clothes which you leave with them at the front and they go through then call your name when done. less then 2 min later they call my name and tell me they would not be taking anything. when i get it back to my car, i open the bag to find the top couple items were unfolded, obiously looked at, but the clothes half way through and to the bottom were not even touched! i had a brand new pair of lucky brand jeans at the bottom of the bag that were bought full price at lucky brand jeans 2 months prior. If they had seen thoes i am sure they would have swooped on them. but they are lazy and do not even look at the stuff you bring in. It was a waste of time and gas and the service was horrible. I wouldnt say that from one experience but ALL my trips there have been exactly the same. So save your time and gas and go somewhere else.<//review>< Pictures>

We had the most exquisite and special experience visiting Chappellet this weekend. Thank you so much to the incredible staff for making our visit so lovely. And an even bigger thank you to Theo, who led our wine tasting tour! Theo is the BEST! She has such a passion for wine and how wine is made. We learned so much from Theo and appreciated the little touches she went out of her way to make our experience so unique. The wines we tasted were on a spectrum from delicious to exquisite! Every wine was well balanced and full of flavor. There aren't that many family owned wineries left in Napa, and it was a pleasure to learn so much about the Chappellet family and the decades of passion and hard work they've put in to make sure their wine is not only exquisite but also a reflection of their family's character and integrity. So thank you, Chappellet, and especially Theo for making our visit so lovely!< /review>

A beautiful place with great wines.

Our friends are members and they had set up a tasting experience.  We were taken to a "room" in the barrel house with "walls" of stacked barrels.  We sat at a nice table while the server stood and walked us through the various wines.

After our tasting we went to the "meadow" and had a picnic with a bottle we purchased and some food we had picked up at a Trader Joe's.  The meadow was very attractive with a beautiful view of vineyards, mountains and the big lake.  It was a very enjoyable and relaxing experience.</Review>

<rating>4</rating><Review>Beautiful location. Spent the first few minutes of tasting observing the wine bottles getting filled by machines which was interesting.  Did not have time to do the tour so missed out on the views of the vineyard. Was disappointed that the 2012 cabs were already sold out and were not part of the tasting as that was one of the main reasons we trekked up the hill to the winery. Overall good experience but no tasting credit when you purchase wine which is somewhat unusual compared to our other winery visits (and at $40/person is somewhat high for just a tasting).< /Review>< Pics>

I was lucky enough to stop by Chappellet Winery last week. It sits atop Pritchard Hill in St. Helena, and has it all; great wine, sweeping views, and a good vibe. If you're looking for a winery that's a little off the beaten path, then I suggest making an appointment for a tasting here. Their Cab and Zinfandel were my favorites, and the Chardonnay was also quite balanced and delicious as well.<//text>

While we are mostly white wine drinkers, we fell in love with ALL of their wines and ended up signing up for their wine club before leaving. The tasting is by appointment only. You will not see anything magnificent at the tasting as far as views but the quality of the wines make up for that. If you want to see more, you will have to book a tour.

Excellent customer service, we received a personalized welcome email from our guide upon leaving the winery with other recommendations in the area. Highly recommended.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<Review>This was another wonderful place - off the beaten path again which makes it a bit of a trip to get to - but worth every winding road taken. The tour is educational, some pretty cool art, breath taking views and one of the best values from a price perspective. Nice Chardonnay (Reserve), Cabernet was terrific and a surprising Pinot Noir. A must stop place.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x8084f8a810aa0f17:0x68c410bb1b5e019f< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

We just came back from Napa and it was our first time.. We visited over 25 wineries and our favorite one was Chappellet Winery, the reason for that is we had an amazing tour, excellent wine and great guest services. We were the youngest couple in our group but Diane made us feel comfortable and welcome. The actual Winery is located on Pritchard Hill the drive was interesting but when we arrived it was all worth it.. the location is absolutely breathtaking... we are already planning a trip with the rest of our family this upcoming fall.</text>

<Text>A little known, hidden gem in the middle of nowhere, this 2 hour tour is very much worth with the visit. Our tour guide, Will, is personable and humorous. The pathway to the cavern was just recently built or renovated within a year or so. This place was privately owned and hand-built by a couple who later passed away in the 1980’s then sold off to the State Parks. Lots of cool facts about this place that I’d consider still part of recent history.

Pricing: $10 adult, $5 children and $10 parking.

Fun facts I learned: this limestone cavern is so solid it withstand earthquakes. A great hideout place in natural disaster.

This place deserves more attention and protection. Really worth the drive to pay a visit. A nice walk through living history.< /Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPD_zNt0Q5vFik7plapDKlH6WdhyOQQE8BOb2mT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOSfkB-Ubz2TmuSBg3wO0Hkc1Ly-sewExJN-AZz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNthLV5EJ2t1ZHzDPYav1Vqt1cOnXVUi5vdegeT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN4B-6X3gWY6sW7mYsdHspiHxVNLtOEn-4SQwYI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPffkYF5WFdKeiH6EjFdmJePs-f5Jb8TU5az-pX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOHzCBskfrrbIHyMV7pWqYKOfHY-DdYiMfKFcXv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNsIB97ym5CM640OOVxSUE73cqYAWz53rF68SUr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM5_cu7mKCfYCJMr-SbjkLmjc39_6J0Pp4F83WN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM4loGnEO7ULIV9kil31X7Avsg1CRSNi8DpsC8B=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMRrQx_uuQlnV_omvvC_3-Y_9NHf2474AMitciu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNBUh87CFDDD9ijnEI2jw1j8aRZ5xyppfxaOYbi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMkpCHt0GE2Uisa9XvUjsJcBCVC4oqOR5yBJKnn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOuXz8FeUJneoFLotOemOMRDbL2rNN7kXt9wrDY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM0QWL1r7CAAm3At5GDaRGistAHG_bt-91AXv4n=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOLDwvcWmgN5SYgnfoG-08je2ngTDfNsH7Texig=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM0bcWUA_NXH4EQHlkdSQr9m6oCg-VSvEPIpJ3m=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPKVCq50ZURHeXb70ndP0Yt0Fbsg6dMSVGtMDDs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNwqPu2wWj2lMLnmCNBJuFyIBU66BrnuQ-EL2oI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOnZN_uFVanxqKssZ7VTdZY2qzNdlGmsALvTF1x=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNBjKQqW-OAe8_PihFLw8wfNU3zCwOz2SnEsOdx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNo9_GUWHUOxgkDvN92pj5hs8eN67RsIr_hv5J-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM9XocZyHGq6tyVS7SBOa8Sy7SEw4FL_E7q4uX_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNNJRms3Vz0b2AIQLkjqR8frUcJDF2laIsAhgwh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOAI4zMHlMHO2ISze4UYCsxCh8aaA3M8xsSmEG-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNa7FjgHmPPO1W6Leck-R3fxunwvxo0kTzJckmZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMSICkYaVZW6zpiLWhljBZgvX2-WywEldWwsZLY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPZmWqy5Ccxl8yN5g8c9MVPYNR8uqvVhPGhuQxh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP9WHzSwX4Zv1DJxvMiFIjPqG3owxYP3uouKr1G=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMW-Fx6wLP9zgnlkifaPMQzsVxOkEUSZb7cwotM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO9RsZYsu7AKFena-WcF8pgb4Wz_jCpZgC2A8GN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOyJ0l_Rk7P4R3b9QNLJuu7Wo1OU0I1uiZCV6KF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

This is the most amazing place in the world. Do not go, unless you call well ahead and obtain confirmed cavern-tour reservations.  Forty people per day, weekends only. Seriously, search for the telephone number and call two to three months ahead for reservations. If you heed my directive... and call ahead... Maybe. Otherwise, forget it. You are wasting your time. No last-minute cancellations... believe me.

Look for the skinny Cave Wolf in my pictures. If you believe, you will see her. She is there.< /Review>

What an amazing place! The history you learn about the Mitchell Caverns is incredibly interesting. Learning how the Caverns formed to how one family tried to capitalize on them and they ultimately ended up as a state recreation area inside a National Preserve is a fun journey through time. Be sure to allow time to explore the little museum and adjoining trails. You'll see some of the best views the Mojave Desert has to offer.< /text>

Super cool area in the Mojave with so much to explore. Book ahead for Mitchell Caverns. Hole-in-the-wall visitors center being renovated and the campgrounds fill up fast. Watch out for wandering cattle and jackrabbits.<//text>

A very beautiful area in the Mojave. Mitchell Caverns are a highlight. Well worth a visit, but make sure make reservations for the caverns.</Text>

Mitchell Caverns was a great place to visit. Tours are on weekends only, and you have to make reservations in advance. Reservations are taken Monday's.

Ask for Andy, best guide for State Parks!< /Text>

Such a cool place to visit - they have camping all around but dont forget to make a reservation. There is plenty to do around the area and definitely recommend scheduling a tour of the local cave system, so cool!</Review>

<Review>The caverns are located in the Providence Mountains State Recreation Area. In short, it is very much worth it. They are easily accessible from the I-40 via Essex Rd. Tours are limited. You will have to call the ranger station to reserve a spot.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

It's a learning curve. The tour guide is full of information and history back from the begining. The two caverns are smaller than i though. The ranger qont take the big group because it's hard to control. We cannot touch anything in the cavern. With the big group you wont be able to see or hear anything in front. It's quite a distance to get there unless you came from Barstow or Needle.< /Text>

It's very special and well-preserved. Reservation required by phone only on Mondays. Tour guide is very knowledgable about caves. The whole tour takes about 1.5 hr.<//Text>

I take my two year old son out to the park here all the time it is pretty nice and clean as far as parks go. It's right in the middle of the neighborhood and hard to find if you aren't familiar with the area. Always have a good time and I recommend you visit the park for yourself.</text>

This park has been recently renovated in last 2018 or so, so the play structure is brand new along with the drinking fountains which pour out cold, clean water (a bonus here in the heat of Elk Grove). They also have 2 tennis courts, 1 basketball hoop, and a baseball field as well. The grassy area at this park is vast, so you can easily play any kind of game with your family. A few benches are dotted around the park with ample sade from the surrounding trees. Lastly, this park is generally not busy, so you can enjoy your time here in peace.</review>

<text>The farmers market has gotten a bit smaller, but the service and people are amazing! Can't beat the produce.

Large field of grass to let your dog run around and exercise. Playground for your kids to play.  Picnic tables and barbeque pit to cook hot dogs and hamburgers. Great place  to have parties.</Text>

Dr. Rob in the pediatric department was amazing! My children were very happy with their visit and already asking when are they coming back. If anyone is still searching to find a dentist for their child/children look no further and start calling Parkside to speak with the amazing Christine and schedule your child/children’s dental appointment.<//Text>

Dr. Chen and the staff at Parkside Dental are awesome! The staff is great and very welcoming, and I always have a fantastic experience with Dr. Chen. I went from hating to go to the dentist to not even being fearful anymore. They always listen to my concerns and take excellent care of me. After my dental surgery Dr. Chen gave me a personal call to check on my well being.  I never thought I would say it  “I love going there.”<//Review>

I thought I would never say I enjoy going to the dentist. But my experiences with Parkside has made me more comfortable. I don’t dread having my teeth cleaned and having the doctor examine my teeth. Everyone there are professional, polite and good at what they do.<//Review>

Every procedure and check up or cleaning has been so comfortable.  I suffer from anxiety and they go out of their way to help me stay calm.  I recently had my wisdom teeth removed and they were super kind and took every step and explained it before putting me under.  I highly recommend this facility for those who want the job done well and kindly.</Text>

I highly recommend Parkside Dental to anyone who wants professional service combined with a friendly welcome environment.  The facility is extremely well maintained; the staff and procedures set the standard for an extremely well managed operation.  The services provided are A+.< /Review>

I absolutely love Parkside Dental! My whole family uses their services. As a person who grew up with a fear of the dentist, it was important that my children receive great care and have a good experience when they went to the dentist. We have not encountered anyone in this office who is not super kind, caring and helpful! I have to give a special shout out to Christine who has always been very helpful, knowledgeable and provides great service any time we come in! I definitely would recommend Parkside to anyone looking for an amazing dental provider for themselves or family.</Review>

I want to say thank you to all at Parkside Dental. Every single one of you have always been absolutely amazing. Always a smile and a greeting when I walk into your doors. I love that you all know me and my family by name. It’s a warm feeling and makes me feel as though we are like family.
Thank you again I would never go to anyone else to clean and take care of my teeth.< /Review>

For over 20 years, Parkside has been my dental and orthodontic choice for my family.  Dr Pieroni is amazing for our adult services; in orthodontics, both Dr. Karkhanechis are terrific explaining the differences and benefits of Invisalign or braces; and staff are friendly, helpful, and courteous - I receive a call before.my appointment as a reminder and to confirm the insurance and payment so I know exactly what to expect at my appointment.  They are quick with responses and information, and coordinated with my health insurance when a family member needed prescriptions for an unexpected dental event. I highly recommend Parkside!<//Text>

Everyone was helpful, kind, and had great customer service. The office was clean, well space for social distancing purposes, hand sanitizer and protective eyewear was available. My dental hygienist, Dia was very informative about my care and had a great bubbly personality.

I wanted to thank everyone at Parkside Dental for making me feel extremely safe and protected when I went in for a cleaning today. Their office protocols and employees are impressive. It was also good to see many of the people I've known over the past 20 years that I have been their patient. Huge thank you to everyone for being on the job to take care of my needs.<//text>

Upon entering their office, Anna was there to check my temperature and ensured I sanitized my hands before proceeding to the waiting area. The staffs and Dr. Chen were friendly and accommodating. One of the best dental clinic in the Bay area. All of our family members had been using Parkside Dental Clinic for our dental care for over 30 years.

<review>Dr Hwang did a root canal , seemed to rush, was not gentle. Work done mon by wed pain so great I called in sick. The medicine he gave did had to be taken every 4 hours (suppose to be every 6-8) I called at 7 am left message , his office did not get response back from him for 8 hrs. Then no one could call in perscription I had to drive to pick up on pain. Then he said there was an infection . I would never return to Dr Hwang. I have had multiple root canals and never had pain like this . Parkside needs a new oral surgeon.<//review><resp>{'time': 1611255284456, 'text': 'Hi Stephanie, my name is Glenda and I am the office Manager for our practice.

Wife and I have been going there for many years. Dr. Peroni has been our Dentist of choice. I also must confess that my wife had me move to her as one of her patients. She has always been there for us through thick and thin.

Highly recommend Parkside for your dental care. Don't think you could go wrong.<//Review>

< Review>
I've been a patient of Dr. Pieroni's since 1984-1985. I chipped my bottom left front tooth late Saturday afternoon. I called and was able to get an appointment for Monday afternoon. I usually take a pre med before any dental work. Chris was able to assist me with getting a pre med and a prescription for future appointments. Dr. Pieroni was able to place some enamel bonding where the tooth was chipped. It looks like my tooth before the break. I've got my smile 😃 back. Even though we have to wear a mask these days 😷. Thanks for assisting me with this matter.</Review>

Very safe atmosphere/environment!! Safety precautions everywhere!  Kudos!! You didn’t sit anywhere too long (except in the dentist/hygienist chair).  I was in and out of there quickly!! 👍👍 then a scheduled root canal. Covid delayed this procedure last year so now the pain (post procedure) was terrible. After hours dental advice was not helpful at all. When you’re in pain, the last thing you want is to look up your dentist’s name (just acquired due to previous dentist retiring). So calling my medical HMO was my only option.  Some relief until I could contact the dentist in the morning, get in and get a stronger pain Rx.  I just wish dental was under the medical umbrella so they work together for the patient’s well being. Thank you.</Review>

Dr Chen and staff have made getting a few crowns and a bridge such a simple and pain free process . The staff here are very kind and genuine. From the hygienist to the Doctors and office staff too. Thank you for removing the anxiety of going to the Dentist.  Doctor Chen even called to check on me after my visit . They enjoy what they do and it shows.< /text>

I’ve been a Parkside fan for over 30 years. My dentist and the supporting staff there has never disappointed and now, with all the new challenges, Parkside has shown, yet again, complacency is not in their toolbox. I highly recommend the Parkside Pros for all your dental needs.< /review>

Last cleaning
To preface this I'd have to say that I hadn't been to the dentist for a year before this recent cleaning, which is around the time of this review. My teeth were thoroughly cleaned. I found out I grind my teeth at night at this cleaning. This is the first time I've heard this news and luckily they caught it early enough to were there's still a chance to protect my teeth. Some other problems were caught quickly. X-Rays were pretty quick and painless. Found out I had to have some fillings fixed, and Dr. Chen was able to do it on the spot within a reasonable time. He administered anesthesia in a very quick and painless way. An added plus is that Dr. Chen is very friendly and easy to talk to.

Previous Cleanings
Very quick and clean. I had a different dentist at this time and he was really good too. Guess this place has always been good to me. This particular dentist, who is retired at this time, also managed to pull out both my lower wisdom teeth  within 5 minutes.

Overall:
I've never had second thoughts about going here.</review>

Parkside is the best. Everyone was great as soon as I step into the office. I never like going to the dentist but Parkside is different.  The staff was super great and my dental experience went smoothly. The explanation of what is being done was thoroughly explained and clarify. I would recommend my family and friends to Parkside.</text>

<Review>I love this office. I was worried about finding a dentist in the area the rivaled my last dentist (who I loved!). Well, I’ll say I definitely chose the right place.

Everyone here is so helpful and kind. If I’m in early, they take me early which is so nice! Insurance and payments were a breeze. Both general dentistry and orthodontic appointments were quick to schedule. Everyone at this office really went above and beyond to make everything easy.

I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this practice.</Review><Resp>None< /Resp></record>

<Text>First visit to Parkside Dental today, had full x-rays and cleaning. Was very impressed by Dr. Chen and hygienist Leza. Both make your visit a very comfortable experience as they take the time to explain the condition of your teeth during cleaning and exam using your x-rays. Very professional and welcoming staff!

4/27/18  Had my maintenance visit; same excellent experience as my first visit 6 months ago. Bertha the hygienist did a great job and was very professional and super friendly. Dr. Chen was again very professional and friendly as well, keeping me well informed of which teeth are “on watch “ for future dental work. So glad I’ve found a dentist I can trust!

12/20/19 The tooth crown for my dental implant was completed today. (Oral surgery was 4 months ago.) This was my first dental implant experience. From the oral surgery to the crown, the entire process was not painful at all. The oral surgeon and Dr. Chen were very professional and kind, explaining the process and always answered all of my questions. And the crown fit perfectly, no issues with chewing. I am extremely satisfied and happy with Parkside Dental.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x80851425a7aff05d:0x917c45fde6726beb<//gmapID></record>

<review>I have been going to Parkside Dental since 1986. Dr. Scott Carter was great, but he retired before me. Now I am seeing Dr. Frank Chen and he is great. Everyone is super nice, puts you at ease and just a great friendly environment. I am retiring out of state, but I might just come back twice a year.

<rating>5< /rating><review>Parkside dental is a wonderful dental office. They offer a wide variety of services and have an amazing staff that treats you incredibly well. They are friendly, personable, and kind. I highly recommend them. I’ve had a fear of visiting the dentist and a great deal of anxiety the first time I stepped into their office. Dr. Peroni and her assistant Shannon helped alleviate that fear and I now look forward to going for cleanings and dental work. I also decided to receive ortho treatment and it’s going exceptionally well. Dr. K, Darlene, Paula, Christina, and Marlon take great care of me and I’ve seen them treat others with the same kindness. My hygienist Jessica is also amazing and gentle during my cleanings. Please give them a visit if you’re looking for a new dentist. The front desk people always remember you by name and Christopher always works with my schedule to book appointments for me. Thank you guys for everything!<//review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80851425a7aff05d:0x917c45fde6726beb</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I read great reviews about the Parkside Dental Care team.  I scheduled an appointment and my hygienist, Jessica took the needed time to understand my concerns.  I met with Dr. Chen and he too also spent quality time to understand and review my history.   The front desk team was also very attentive.  A very professional office and very clean too.
I highly recommend the Parkside dental team if you're looking to change.
They also take Delta Dental patients.</text>< user_id>

I have been coming to Parkside Dental for over 30 years! I’ve had the BEST dentists and hygienists!!! The office staff is amazing so sweet and helpful and kind. About 18 months ago I got braces for the first time and met the Orthodontist team! Dr. K is amazing! The ortho crew is so fun and have made my experience easier than I ever expected. As an adult getting braces it was a little scary but they have made it easy and have become like family!
I recommend Parkside dentist office for all your dental needs! A quick note I now live in Fremont and commute to come to Fairfield that’s how much I love my dental Office and all the friends I’ve made here!  Come and visit you will NOT disappointed!< /Text>

<Review>My daughter and I had our first visit with Parkside dental and everything was amazing. The staff is very welcoming and have great disposition. I needed a new retainer and I was grateful they could do my fitting while I was there. I was a little hesitant because of a bad experience at a different dentist, but they put my worry to rest. Ms. Bernice was awesome! Thank you to everyone we encountered and a huge thanks to the peds department because kids love compliments. She takes great care of her teeth and was happy they took notice. See you soon!<//Review>< rating>

<Time>1462472352123< /Time><rate>5</rate><Text>Today, Dr. Williams at Parkside Dental replaced an old silver filling and an old crown.  The new filling and crown look beautiful.  The teeth now look so natural.  I watched their new machine make the perfectly fitting crown in a few minutes.  All the work was completed in one short visit.  The skill and concern for my comfort shown by Dr. Williams and his staff made the whole experience very pleasant.  The high quality of the result made me very glad I had the work done.  And the cost was very reasonable.  Parkside handles all my dental needs.  They are certainly the best.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

Very good place, lots of specialists. I came in for a second opinion about a deep pocket I was told to have by my current dentist and Parkside dental told me it had to do with my wisdom tooth. My dentist wanted to have me an expensive antibiotic treatment but that would of been unnecessary since taking out my wisdom teeth would solve the issue. I'm totally switching over to Parkside Dental now. They are here to serve my needs not dry out my pockets.</Text>

<text>My special needs daughter was too anxious to tolerate dental work in the office.Dr. Zaeni offered to give my daughter all the necessary dental restoration work under anesthesia at the hospital. That way she would be comfortable while allowing full access for Dr. Zaeni to do cleaning, fillings, crowns, & sealants. We had Kaiser Insurance so the surgery was done at Kaiser Vacaville. Dr. Zaeni was very kind and gentle with my daughter. She understands children and has the ability to put them at ease. She explained the procedure in length with me, answered all my questions and kept me well informed of any changes in the care plan. Her office was on top of getting things coordinated between me, the hospital and the dental office. I received text messages, email confirmations and copies of all the necessary paperwork via email pdf.  I worked with Christine. She is very organized, told me upfront about all the costs and explained insurance vs out of pocket expenses and was very clear in what to expect. This was my daughter’s first surgery. It was a positive experience for her. She was very anxious at first but Dr. Zaeni was there in preop and went over everything again, answered any last minute questions. It was emphasized she would take a nap and would not be aware/feel/see anything. The preop team was gentle and created a calm nonrushed enviroment for her. They allowed my 2 year old to sit with my older daughter in the gurney until she was wheeled into the OR. A family centered approach was encouraged. It was great. My daughter tolerated surgery well. Gentle wake up. The anesthesia team was excellent. The Recovery room staff was very caring and allowed me to keep my 2 year old in the recovery room with me. The two girls stayed in the gurney together to comfort each other. She got a goodie bag of toys & dental floss, toothpaste. The Volunteers at the hospital gave her a handmade blanket and lion stuffy. No further post op complications once she got home. She had NO PAIN. It was amazing. I did not need to give my child Motrin. She just drank tons of water and slept. Was herself & playful by the late afternoon. Dr. Zaeni called to check up on her the next day. Gave her personal cell in case any issues came up. I never had to call her. It was the best outcome and I am grateful to Dr. Zaeni & her office staff for her excellent care of my daughter.< /text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>{'time': 1563986376735, 'text': "Hi Rachel, Thank you so much for such a  great review!

<review>So far, so good. I feel very comfortable with Dr. Chen, especially since Dr. Carter always made my dental visits more than endurable. I would rather give birth than go to the dentist but Parkside's staff and Dr. Chen have convinced me this is the best place to be when you have fear  issues like mine. I have dental work coming up, but I know I am in good hands.<//review>< pictures>

<review>I had a great experience today with an in-office crown replacement by Dr. Chen and his very pleasant and professional chairside staff.  How cool that you can make the crowns in-house!  And, thanks for letting me observe how the crown-making process occurs.

As a new patient (recently moved to Fairfield area), I feel fortunate to have chosen this well-organized and client-oriented dental office.

You made the experience today pain-free, and almost (it is dental work, after all!) Fun.<//review><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

As always, like in past years' visits, my routine dental appointment today went excellently well. Bernice is truly a wonderful hygienist...very meticulous to details & I love that skill in her.  I met Dr. Chen for the first time having replaced Dr. Carter late last year.  He's very friendly. I'll certainly recommend Parkside Dental to anybody who's looking for excellent dental service(s). They have a one-stop shop for all your dental needs including specialty services (orthodontics, endodontics, periodontics, etc). Very professional & super friendly people! You'll be in good hands at this place!!!</Review>

My family and I became patients of Parkside Dental Care in 1981, we left the area for a few years and are now back and are patients at Parkside Dental once again.  We have been extremely happy with the care that we receive here.  The staff is wonderful.  We highly recommend this office.< /Review>

Everybody was friendly, and my appointment was right on time. The lady at the check in counter helped me explain my insurance, and she did a great job, too.
I have no complaints about this dental office< /Review>

I absolutely LOVE my experiences at Parkside Dental Care. I have very sensitive teeth and have always had a hard time with other dentists understanding but Dr Chen at Parkside is sincere and very understanding. I would definitely recommend Parkside Dental to everyone!</Review>

I love them so much! I'm a hater when it comes to dentists and have always had issues with my teeth. I'll never forget when I started crying in Dr. Chen's chair because of my overwhelming circumstances (and getting into a bad car accident that morning). He has always been so caring, thorough, professional, and supportive. They are a solid network totally driven by genuine care for their clients. I've had surgery, cleanings, ortho, x-rays..everything. I've never been so motivated in my life to go to the dentists' office. God bless all the employees here. I'm so grateful.<//Review>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><review>Ripped me off big time! Fraudulent, greedy dental office. Charged me over $1000 for 2 small fillings, that I probably didnt even need in the first place. Had me pay a $180 deductible since I wanted white fillings and said my insurance would pay the rest. Later sent me to collections for $980!

< review>
I have never been happier with a dentist or dental office.  Dr. Williams is a brilliant and incredibly skillful dentist.  Two other dentist I had seen could do no more than pull teeth and have dentures made. Dr. Williams insisted on no less than making my mouth whole again. He literally rebuilt my mouth, installing in three bridges and adding or replacing ten crowns for a total of 26 teeth. I am so incredibly thankful for what he did for me. The tears welling up in my eyes barely express how thankful I am.< /review>

I’ve been seeing Dr. Pieroni for more than 10 years. I drive from San Pablo, Ca for my dental visitis and it’s always nice to talk with everyone at the office. I’ve been through braces, root canals and implants. I recommend this to anyone looking for a family oriented dental office that cares.<//review>

I had an appointment with the hygienist, Leeza (sp.?).  She was prompt, thorough, and very sweet...making the process enjoyable and painless.  Thank you!
Today, I had a cavity filled by Dr. P...she is patient, kind, and thoughtful...and the process was painless! Thank you, Dr. P., for all you do and are.<//text>

I've been going to Parkside for 30 years now, and plan to go at least another 30.Dr Williams has been my dentist and with Lisa cleaning my teeth I couldn't be more satisfied.  I had other dentists there pull my wisdom teeth and work on my gums and was very impressed with everyone without exception.</Review>

<Rate>1</Rate><Review>We have been going to Parkside Dental for years and love the staff.  However, their billing department has always been an issue.  They quote one price, then charge another.  I had a deep cleaning 3 years ago and today was told that my "Normal" cleaning are special now and not only do I have to pay a deductible, but my insurance only covers 55% of the "Special" cleaning.  It was the worst cleaning ever!  So they would rather loss a patient then have them come in for normal cleanings twice a year.  Parkside Dental has become a business and patient care is out the door!  So am I, sad day when I left today!  They put in inactive status and no one seemed to care.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

<review>I called to schedule an apointment as a new patient in tgis office and told them I was in serious pain. Parkside Dental schedule me on monday for consultation and extraction the next day. Dr. Chen was performing the surgery. Honstly I was nervous and scared but Dr. Chen and the staff made me it easy for me. Dr. Chen was so considerate that he makes sure I wasnt in pain during the surgery. This Dental office is great, they do what is best for you, Doctors are always ready at your scheduled apointment, the facility is very nice and the staff is truely pasionate.<//review></record>

The experiance at Parkside Dental begins with Dr. Williams staff of customer service
oriented people who are very, very well trained and at all times professional.

My needs were evaluated and a treatment plan was thoroughly presented to me
with options, priorities and a very affordable finance plan.  The procedures I needed
were extensive (multiple root canals, tooth extractions and a very, very long bridge)
so the appointments were scheduled in order to maximize the amount of work done at each visit without spending a lot of time in the chair.  Also, Megan, who assisted Dr. Williams and was there each time I came in, was amazing.  She knew my history
and consistantly explained what I could expect at each visit.

Appointments were ALLWAYS ON TIME and I was not left sitting in the chair
for an extended period of time while I was being rotated with other patients.

Having required an extensive amount of dental work done prior to seeing Dr. Williams I can tell you from experience that Parkside Dental is the best.</review>

I needed to make a newer edit for my review, because I've been back to Parkside since I posted the original.
In November, I noticed that one of my clear retainers was broken, so I called Parkside to see if they could fit me in while I would be in town visiting some friends. Honestly, I thought it was a long shot, and that they couldn't. Imagine my surprise when I was booked a Saturday morning appointment with the ortho clinic.
Once in the chair, I explained the issue, and they went right to work. Dr. K examined my bite and when she was finished, Myron took an impression and said they could have my new retainer to me before I left the next week.
The best part, though? EVERYONE remembered me! I thought it was cool to see 98% of the same people at the clinic, but that all of them knew me by sight and were excited to see me? Wow, you guys. Customer service will NEVER EVER get better than that. They asked about both my kids (who had been patients there), and my husband (who usually came in with us), too! I felt so . . . loved? Appreciated? Cared for? I don't know, all of the above.
If you're looking for a dentists office where you can get all of your needs met, and have the staff feel like family, Parkside Dental is FAR AND AWAY the best choice! You absolutely can't go wrong as a patient here!

I've been a patient at Parkside Dental Care with Dr. Williams for several years.  Right off the bat, he came highly recommended for an excellent "chair-side" manner and quality healthcare.  The support staff in the office got rave reviews for their friendliness, the ease of making/rescheduling appointments, and how helpful they were with any questions.
To say that I was skeptical of such glowing terms would be an understatement.  I'm not a fan of the dentist, so I withheld all judgements until afterwards.  Imagine my surprise when all of those compliments were proven to be facts.
Early on, Dr. Williams recommended that I get braces.  He told me the usual things, how worth it the hassle would be in the end, how great it would be to have a beautiful smile after so long hiding my teeth.  It took me a while, but I came around.  First, to Dr. Ahn for oral surgery (also a great experience, outside of the expected pain and bruising of half my face that made staying inside for a week a necessity), and then across the hall to Dr. K for Orthodontics.
Seriously, there isn't enough nice things to say about Dr. K's staff (as well as Dr. K herself) and the quality of care that I have received in her office.  Francisco is always SO patient when working with my crazy schedule - and believe me, it takes an effort to make appointments work, at times.  Christina stays on top of the billing for my care, and if there are any problems, I know immediately. She's taken the time to answer numerous questions and run out all payment options so that I can be sure I'm getting a service at a price that I'm comfortable with.  It makes going through this hassle a little bit easier, knowing my account is in capable hands.
The technicians, Darlene, Shannon, Myron, and Danielle, always treat my family and I like they're stoked to see us that day, which I find that I look forward to with each visit.  There's something to having a friendly relationship with the people that are going to have their hands in your mouth for the duration of your treatment.

I recommend this office to everyone I know who's in the market for a dentist.  As I said in the beginning of my review, I'm not a huge fan of the dentist, but I'm glad to say that I go to Parkside.  They've done a wonderful job of changing my opinion and I can't wait to see the end results of my orthodontic treatment.< /Text>

<Text>Friendly and quick service! Came in for an oil filter and they conducted a complimentary multiple point inspection and called out a few filters that required replacement. Would definitely come back for any follow up maintenance. Also, always check online if they have any promotions or discounts, I saved $20 on my oil change!<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>{'time': 1599258941589, 'text': 'We love seeing all those stars!

Horrible, don’t go here. We did an oil change & about a week later our car leaked the oil out & turns out they didn’t screw the oil plug properly & fell off while we were out driving it. VERY dangerous. They didn’t do their job properly, go somewhere else. We had to spend even more money to fix it &  do the oil change again.</review>

I tried to change my wife's oil and the  the bolt was impossible to loosen. I tried liquid nails and a breaker bar. nothing worked. The last place to change the oil was this jiffy lube and they somehow welded the bolt on. I would not recommend using this place if you ever change your own oil.<//text>

<review>I get told to park on the side of the building (with my two kids) couple minutes later a new customer drives right up to the bay and gets out of her car. The technician gets in her car and pulls it into the bay. I ask if she had an appointment, he said “no appointments”. I explained I was told to park and would be next. He just said “sorry, your supposed to park here.” And that was it, he didn’t offer to switch vehicals or anything so I told him I’d find another place to change my oil.<//review>< pictures>

Attempted to charge me 27.99 for a 12 pack of Michelobe Amber and directed me to swipe my card. When I asked him how much the 12pack was, he deleted it and changed the price to 15.99. This place is untrustworthy and gave us the creeps from the moment we walked in.< /Text>

<Date>1622944436657<//Date><Text>We just moved in a month ago. Everything has been amazing... from the excellent amenities (pool, beautiful landscaping,  Amwzon hub, weekly food trucks) to the apartment itself (clean, comfortable, efficient).  And wow, the location!!! We walk everywhere!!!

Incredibly happy and grateful to live in a comfortable,  thoughtful, community.

Last, and most impressive above anything else here at Ava Burbank, is the maintenance crew. Upon moving in, there were a few larger maintenance concerns and a few minor. All were addressed within 24-hours and repairs happened as soon as they could be (usually later the same day). In particular,  Ricardo has been very helpful and is a great problem solver.  Gabriel is absolutely top notch, a true professional (respectful, courteous) and excellent at ensuring tasks have been completed (and completed well).

Looking forward to raising my family here over the next many years!!!<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Text>Moved here on 1st of OCT 2019.  Prior to moving in, we asked specifically about security and chaining our bikes in the garage space near our car.  Was told many people do this and should not be a problem.  We asked about theft.  Was told no issues here.  Fine.  We move in and less than 30 days we had one of our bikes (which was chained and secured) vandalized and a front wheel stolen.  Filed police report.  Complained at the office.  Was told they would up security patrols.  They don't have any security cameras in the main drive ways - so no proof.  Only camera is at main office.  Fast forward to November - same situation - the same crook is back - this time lifted the bike covers trying to steal the wheel of the same bike (which we replaced and added more chains and locks).  Went to office again - spoke with "community manager" - was told that security departs at 6 am and staff arrives at 9.  The theft and attempted theft both occurred between the hours of 6-9 am.  Find a different community to live - this one does not care about your personal security or property! They only provide poor excuses about why they don't have cameras.  This is almost 2020 - and this place can not even provide a safe and secure living environment for their tenants!  SHAMEFUL< /Text>< pictures>

After asking for months if parking spots were available, and being told several times “no, but we will let you know when one opens up” without anyone even writing down contact information nor letting me in the office anytime I’ve came to deal with literally any situation here I’m very unhappy with how this situation is being handled. It’s disrespectful to me, to have to relocate all of my possessions and my vehicle to better suit one of your other tenants. Especially when I’m the one who was clearly wronged in this situation.

However, your employee, Ethan, on the day I was “issued” the parking spot, came out and asked what I was there for, like every other time, and then walked back in after I told him I was still searching for a parking spot. He came out a few minutes later saying he had a few spots available, one being J15 which he recommended because of its proximity to my unit. I agreed to the parking spot, and told him I would also need a key fob since I didn’t have one. He seemed unsure as to whether or not he could give out a new key fob as if he hadn’t been working there long and was unclear if the rules. He went in asked another coworker I’m assuming, again because all of this was being handled in front of the main building (which seemed like the norm considering it’s been that way since we moved here). After talking with someone he came back with the fob and the spot number J15 for me. This was about a month maybe longer ago. I asked if this was all I needed and he stated that I would see the updates to my lease.

I’m sure it is not a hassle to amend the document they signed and simply have them use a new spot, as it seems I am being treated in the same manner currently.

It showcases a lot about this company as it seems with every situation here everyone seems to have a different set of rules in which they must abide by as residents. The amount of inconsistencies in policy and procedures in the short span I’ve lived here are far too high.

How is it that there is no addendum required, or to be found when I was given the space. But now it’s a irreversible document that requires me to now surrender the spot that was given to me. It may seem minuscule in comparison but imagine if it was a situation where someone’s apartment was accidentally leased out although they had already been there for months due to an employee forgetting to do his part of the paperwork. You wouldn’t demand they leave so the new tenants could move in, you would correct your error and relocate the incoming tenants instead. I don’t see how the accountability is being transferred to me for an employees error.
I’m usually pretty understanding, but this is frustrating on many levels.</Review>

<Review>I'm giving this a 3 star because of the office staff. They're always friendly but they never answer their phones and their hours are constantly changing. I have been trying to reach them to be able to get another parking space. The first parking space that I paid for, they refused to tow the other vehicle that stayed there multiple times after it was apart of my lease. I am paying way too much money for a apartment here to be treated like this. Never have needed any maintenance help but I do have to say that when I first moved in, some of them helped me moving in a few of my items which was very nice of them to do.</Review><pics>None<//pics><response>{'time': 1623426584576, 'text': "I'm sorry to hear that you haven't gotten sufficient response from our team, Kristy.

So far so good. We are paying less than our last place, but it honestly feels like and upgrade. What’s most impressive is how quickly maintenance responds to requests. Gabriel was super friendly and on top of our move in repair requests. So far so good!< /text>

Have lived here for over a year now and absolutely love it. The staff has been very quick to accommodate any problems we may have as far as maintenance or technical inquiries regarding our online account. In particular I would like to call out Romeo Singh who is the customer service supervisor. When I call the office, I immediately ask for him because I know I'll be taken care of, quickly and correctly.</review>

This is intended for Romeo. He is a gentleman in all fashions of that word. I have never met a more genuine and kind person such as him. My son passed last year and this year and I mentioned that to him while crossing paths. This year in 2021 he dropped of a card in remembrance of my son. This brought so much joy to my life. I have no words to show my gratitude to this gentlemen.

Thank you Romeo  I hope your company knows they have the most wonderful employee</Text>

I wonder if they ever fixed that leaky ceiling and got rid of the worms that would fall onto the stove in the apartment I had there. One of the biggest mistakes was signing a lease to live there.

Also funny story, I was forced into giving them a high rating on Yelp once when I lost my key fob. A good review on Yelp means no paying for the replacement key fob.<//text>

< review>
I am a resident at AVA Burbank for the past 2 years. I must mention that the maintenance is top class here. Luis Aiatorre is a maintenance person at AVA Burbank, responds to any request very quickly and fixes the problem with ease. No need to follow-up again for additional issues with those fixes. I would love to stay at AVA as long as I can.</review>

I just wanted to leave a review for Luis Aiatorre. He was absolutely amazing! He was very nice when he arrived to fix a few things in the apartment. he fixed everything perfectly, was super clean, and respectful of my area. He is also so wonderful at following up on parts that need to be ordered and reassures me that he hasn't forgotten about it. He is the best!< /text>

I must praise the maintenance team, Erick Contrerras and Luis Alatorre, for their professionalism and hard work to fix our heating system. They were very proficient and thorough, walking me through the process from start to finish and explaining what needed to take place. They worked in a timely fashion and fixed the issues perfectly. Very thankful for their service. The maintenance has always been top tier and dependable in my entire living experience here at AVA Burbank.< /Text>

The location is amazing, (you can walk to bars, restaurants, coffee shops, liquor stores, and the grocery store is across the street) the units are painted in cool colors and the community is really well maintained and pretty to walk around.

The real reason this place is a 5 star complex is the employees. We have had 2 service requests (nothing major, just an outlet didn’t work and an issue with our blinds) and it was fixed within 24 hours of submitting the request.

But the real MVP of going above and beyond in customer service is Hernan in the office. He is always attentive and kind, he responds quickly and diligently to all of our requests, and he makes sure to let us know that we are a priority.

Sometimes I personally feel like asking for little things or asking stupid questions is annoying or overly needy but Hernan always makes me feel better, and let’s me know he’s happy I came to him with my problems.

When we moved in we had to be out of our old apartment in like 2 days (2 apartments fell through) and we told Hernan this when we started looking. He told us he would do his best to rush the process, but he couldn’t make any promises. Well he did! We were in the apartment having to only spend one night in a hotel.

We are so grateful to Hernan, the maintenance staff, and all of AVA Burbank for making us feel welcome and for helping us find our home!<//review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>{'time': 1599679058510, 'text': "Wow, Kait!

<pics>None</pics><Text>I'm gonna divide my review in 2 parts. This first part is for the great side of Ava. Good location, beautiful amenities and great response from the maintanance team. They are always quick and very respectful with our things in the apt. For the office staff, I have  to praise Romeo. He helped me since the beginning to find the best apt for me and even when I decided to move out, he was still very helpful and corteous. He always has a smile on his face, great attitude and always willing to help. Will surely contact Romeo when I come back to Califonia.

However, I would give zero stars to this other guy in the office staff, Ethan. I was a tenant for the past 2 years there, and every time I went to the office and Ethan was there, he approached me with a suspicious attitude, very rude, like I wasn't supposed to be there. Sometimes, when I was right outside my building drinking my Starbucks coffee, he would scan me upside down, like I was a thief. And the few times I bumped into him and tried to greet him, he just gave me a look back. I just think a person like that shouldn't be dealing with customers.<//Text>< username>

The maintenance team led by Cesar is amazing. They are very helpful, timely, and efficient. Thank you Cesar for a wonderful team and management led by you.  I say that because I've seen Cesar do a lot of physical work (picking up trash etc...) himself and not just delegating the work to his team. He is very polite, resourceful, efficient, and friendly.</text>

< Review>
I updated this review after being helped by Romeo and the Katherine for different issues with smoking and loud music from a neighbor.

This will be my third year at Ava burbank. Currently I'm renting a one bedroom on one of the north pass Ave apartments on a second floor. Most of the time its quiet and peaceful with the community and I haven't really had an issue with packages/mail other than when the post office misdelivers it to the building next door. In that case the resident messaged me and I was able to grab it quick. For most amazon packages they have an Amazon hub which is a secure way to pick up my stuff anytime. The only time they don't use that is for large/oversized packages. I used the hub excessively especially during the last year and even during the midst of covid had little to no issues.

The apartment itself is well maintained I've only needed to call maintenence 3 times in three years for the toilet and a buzzing ac but in each case they showed up the same day and it was fixed either shortly or the next day in the case of the ac because they gave me a new one.

The sound is blocked better in the bedroom/kitchen and bathroom. I can hear loud bass if my downstairs neighbor is playing it and you'll know if someone is smoking in their apartment from your kitchen at least in my case.

For the sound I had an issue with loud bass but Katherine the community manager has been great with reaching out to the other resident and trying to resolve the issue in a way that both apartments can continue to live and work peacefully.

For the smoking issue the building is smoke free and Romeo the leasing agent I worked with was able to take care of that after a few months beyond what actions I took to filter the air with filtration devices.

In these cases I had nothing against Ava and I tried different things to resolve it peacefully, just be sure to reach out if your having an issue so the staff can work with you.

Some positives are there are several grocery and restaurants only a few blocks away depending on your building. Gym and pools, A weekly food truck that comes by the leasing office. You pay rent online and they lowered rates recently at least for my unit which is saving me several hundred a month. The laundry uses an app that gives you time estimates and is in a shared spot in my building but I think some buildings or apartments have them in unit.

Hope this helps.< /Review>

After a long search for the perfect apartment, I finally found it! Thanks to Hernan, he's been helpful from the day I toured the unit up until now after two weeks living here. Very happy with the spacious apartment and staff. Justin and Hernan, helping me feel right at home :)</review>

The repairman's name's Jojo, he was punctual, quick/efficient and pleasent to be around, positive demeanor.

I brought this place down by two stars, am uncertain that they'll keep a rating that high - the community felt vulnerable from a number of various insecurities and the utilities were generally unreliable (none of the dishwashers here actually successfully cleaned a plate (which isn't a problem as long as you clean after you eat and don't mind washing by hand (which I personally don't)) and not one person (staff included) has checked the lint trap while I have lived here (the number of times I heard my roommates complain that their dryer wasn't working correctly only to discover that one must clean the lint trap has been comical)). I'll move to a different Ava apartment (assuming that they are willing to continue allowing me to live here), mostly because the staff is generous and quick to accommodate, but there are some serious "minor inconveniences" which leave the community vulnerable. (I'll admit that my opinions are subject to change)< /Text>

Living in AVA Burbank is one of the worst experiences I’ve had; management doesn’t care about the safety of tenants, enabling AirBnb and other rentals in the buildings, some of them putting in risk the community by throwing parties and breaking bottles in the common areas. The buildings are NOT refurbished,  and most of the amenities have several malfunctions. They always have excuses for doing their job, replacing damaged elements on their units and letting alien renters from third parties destroy doors multiple times. When there’s an issue, they don’t reach to the involved parties, they just send a general email. Conflictive neighbors can throw bottles and drink and smoke in front of children all day long. When issues arise, they say they cannot do a thing, but when it’s time to pay for anything, their managers harass the tenants to pay constantly. Over priced light construction cheap apartments and inoperative management make AVA Burbank a nightmare, if you can sleep by night living there with the noise of the other apartments thanks to the cheap walls.< /text>

<Time>1596551414647< /Time><Rating>2</Rating><Review>Look closely at how many reviews their reviewers have written!  After each service call, they ask for a Google review so you are getting reviews of their maintenance crew (well deserved) and not the apartment complex.

In short: DO NOT MOVE HERE!  It's a bait and switch.  Don't fall for it!  If they're trying to rent you Apartment 23 in the 4210 W Sarah St. building, the upstairs neighbors are the loudest I've ever experienced in my 20 years of renting in Los Angeles.  You will be up all hours of the day/night because of whatever it is they do up there (sounds like gymnastics or wrestling or circuit training).  They WILL jack up your rent at the end of your lease--YES, even in a time of a global pandemic. And ROMEO (who tells me he's the manager) is not only entirely unresponsive 90% of the time, but when he does respond, offers no help and literally says he's too busy to answer.  Literally.  I have this in writing.  Having said that, when he wanted me to give him more than 30 days of notice that I was moving, he was able to call and email me multiple times a day.

Two stars are for the maintenance staff.  They are truly lovely, work incredibly hard, and exemplify customer service.  Their leasing staff should take a page from the maintenance crew, honestly.

Whole story:  Let's start with the bait and switch.  These folx will lure you in with leasing specials and will treat you like gold.  They will assure you that there will always be someone on hand to help you and that they will take care of your every concern.  When I mentioned that I'd heard a lot of people have to move after one year due to rent increases, I was assured that this was not the case (they lied).  I watched every single one of my neighbors systematically get priced out throughout the year I was in the apartment, meaning they had to leave and the apartments then get filled with college students all bunking together and splitting the costs.  What this means is that you have 6-8 20something year olds living in each apartment.  Imagine what that sounds like.  Now, imagine that these apartments are not made for that many people...so parking is overflowed...so the trash overflows and sits around rotting in the middle of the parking lot (even though the maintenance crew is constantly cleaning)...plumbing and grounds get worn.  The "secured gate" at the front of my apartment was broken for the entire year I lived there.  Go there now, and push on it.  It's not even locked.

When my lease was coming to an end (a few months prior), I reached out to Romeo to ask if AVA was providing any assistance due to the COVID situation.  He assured me that they were helping others by discounting/freezing rents and that he would absolutely submit a request for some assistance for me.  A few days passed and I didn't hear back from him.  I reached out again and was told he could not help me.  When I asked why he had said he would be able to help me and now, suddenly, he says he cannot...his response was, "Things change every day.  Sorry!"  At this point, I was forced to find cheaper rent elsewhere.  Since he wanted to be able to start marketing my apartment, he began reaching out to me via phone and email every single day.  It became so disruptive (multiple phone calls in a day) that I asked he please allow me to just give him the 30 days as I was legally required to do.  He then sent me paperwork that waived my right to a walk through of the apartment.  I reached out to ask him how I would be able to get the itemized list of any deductions they planned to take out of my deposit and he told me they were not offering walk throughs.  When I explained that it is my legal right as a renter, he told me that I could take a video of all of the things I think I might be charged for and send it to him.  This is not a solution.  At the end, I was not given my walk through or itemized list of deductions.

When emailing Romeo about any questions or needs of mine as a renter, it takes over a week and multiple check ins to get any sort of response at all.</Review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

<review>Jojo followed up with us on a heater that’s been quite problematic over the last few weeks. After taking care of that handily, he noticed our front door knob was loose, and stopped to take care of it even though it wasn’t a part of the work order he was called for. On top of that, he’s friendly, a joy to talk to, and an ABBA fan!<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>{'time': 1581700501898, 'text': 'Thanks for taking the team to write such a wonderful review, Bryce!

I wish I had listened to all these bad reviews. AVA Burbank is unlivable because of the paper thing walls. Every step your neighbor takes feels like a giant stomp above your head (and it doesn't help when they walk around in the middle of the night). Want to get some quiet time and read a book in your apartment? Impossible. Want to get a night of unbothered restful sleep? Also impossible. I am at the point where I'm willing to break my lease so I can have just a little peace... DON'T LIVE HERE.<//review>

<Review>Way overpriced for the experience you get living here. Only live here if you like paper thin walls and hearing every little creak and sound, especially from animals, on the second floor. Many sleepless nights here and no help from the leasing office. The noise is unbearable as every footstep sounds like stomping. Spoke with management about moving to a top level, but there is a $1,000 penalty for switching units, which is not how you keep tenants happy. Can't wait to move out. My one suggestion is to only allow animals on the first floor, as to keep noise levels at a minimum. It would certainly improve my sanity.</Review><user_name>Benjamin Holden</user_name>< userid>

I’m updating my review based on my experience of living here fo few month. If the situation change I will update my review.

Recently I have been experience constant notice coming from a machine of another building outside of my apartment(belong to AVA). I called last week and no one came to fix it for two days straight. I made numerous calls to the maintainer office, also complained to the front desk. The problem was fixed two days later which means I couldn’t sleep for two nights straight. Yet same thing is happening again this week. Called last night and the noise is still going on while night.

Really running out of patient with this AVA team.

Previous review: Moved in about a month ago in AVA Burbank. Everything is pretty great so far!! It’s a good neighborhood and a very continent location. Romeo is always super helpful, he check in with me from time to time how’s everything going. Cesar who is the maintenance manager is also very attentive!  I’m very happy I moved here :)< /text>

<Text>My fiance and I came here to inquire about a unit we saw online and when we met with the leasing agent, Oliver. We were not disappointed. He went above and beyond to make sure we had every shred of information that we would need for our move, and for when we are occupants.We did not have an appointment and within minutes we were walking into the unit for a viewing. Oliver, is very personable and understanding. I recommend reaching out to him for any information you need regarding this property.

In terms of the apartments, the ones we saw were beautiful and recently remodeled. Each collection of units had a pool within a short walk  from their door (some even right outside the door).

<Text>My wife and I just moved into our AVA Apartment a month ago. So far, we absolutely love our new place and the community, but we wanted to give a shout-out to one person in particular who made our lease signing and move-in process simple and seamless-- Oliver in the main office. When we were looking at apartments, AVA wasn't on our radar. We dropped by on a whim, and were lucky enough to have Oliver show us around. He was kind enough to show us not one, but six (!) different units-- always with a smile on his face. Soon, we found an apartment that delivered on everything we wanted, but his easygoing attitude and endless patience are what pushed us over the edge to choose AVA as our next home. We signed our lease later that afternoon (which Oliver stayed late to oversee). After our initial visits, Oliver has been present to help us out with anything we've needed. He truly makes you feel at home in this community, and we're lucky to have him. The next time we have a friend looking to move, we're going to send them Oliver's way because we know they'll be in great hands.<//Text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

JoJo has been a huge help. We moved in recently and needed help with a few maintenance issues. He was so cheerful, so efficient and got the job done right. Thank you JoJo!</Text>

<text>Living at AVA Burbank is a blessing! The location is perfect the facility is clean and quiet but best of all is the quick respondence for maintenance request. More specifically JoJo! JoJo is very sweet and friendly while he fixed the ceiling where the AC unit is and painted it, he fixed a closet door and changed a lightbulb for us. No job is ever too small for him. Jojo is one of the best parts about AVA because he represents that people here are reliable, generous and exceptional at their job.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>{'time': 1582579750530, 'text': 'Thank you, Ashley!

I've lived here for five months , and  found the place to be clean,, well maintained and peaceful. Any requests have been taken care of  immediately.. The pool area and premises is always neat and clean.. The staff, especially Ashely and Nick are really friendly and willing to help with anything and everything.. management is the best I have experienced in my life.. I have never had any parking issues, and the complex is very convenient to freeways and shopping.<//Text>

<review>AVA Burbank is such an awesome place to live and in a safe area. The apartment I stayed in was beautiful, I hate that I have to leave but I know that I will be back soon. Ashlee was very helpful in helping me with my move out. I greatly appreciate their service and complex. I'm going to miss writing my schedule all over my chalkboard walls. Would recommend anyone to stay here.</review>< response>

AVA Burbank is clean, safe and well-run.  The maintenance staff are hard-working, polite and helpful.  Christiane in the office responds lightening fast to service requests. The leasing staff are always friendly and willing to help.  They are constantly improving the place - new washers and dryers, fresh coat of paint in exercise room.  By the way, the AVA Burbank Facebook community is like a family. Always there to answer questions or give great advice or referrals.  I’m grateful to all of you for making my move from Chicago soooooo easy.  Feel free to contact me with any questions.<//review>

Moving from the Midwest for a new job, it was imperative that I had a safe, clean, and updated apartment community with off street secured parking. Amanda was incredibly helpful by offering me different apartment options and also learning about the area before I moved. I love this apartment community and look forward to living at AVA Burbank!</text>

<Text>When I moved from Northern California to the Los Angeles area, I did not have a lot of options, because I am a dog owner.  But when I found AVA Burbank, I knew I was "home".

First and foremost, Brendan Sund in the leasing office was a lifesaver.  He helped me find the best unit available to fit my needs and let me know that AVA Burbank would accommodate my furry friend.  During the course of shopping for the unit and all along the path to moving in and getting settled, Brendan has gone above and beyond with amazing support and service.

Why do I love AVA Burbank?  Let me count the ways...

1) A modern refresh of classic architecture...  it feels "retro" without feeling "old".  I live in a 450 sq ft studio and I am happy as a clam.  Tons of built-in storage...  I almost got rid of some of my furniture because there is so much storage in the unit.

2) My unit has a reserved parking spot with a BIG storage locker that can accommodate six of those large Costco black & yellow storage bins.

3) A great little pool surrounded by palm trees and patio furniture, complete with a HUGE gas grill.

4) Pet-friendly buildings, with complimentary dog waste bags at the door and waste stations along the sidewalks to capture bags.  The tree-lined neighborhood is perfect for dogs...  flat, quiet, and full of SQUIRRELS!!  An off-leash dog park is available a few miles away in North Hollywood.

5) A large complex (with plenty of support services) made up of over a dozen smaller buildings, which makes for a cozier environment where you recognize your neighbors and the building does not turn into a party palace.

6) A Von's grocery store next door and equidistant Trader Joe's and Whole Foods in the neighborhood.  A variety of restaurants within walking distance for when you don't feel like cooking.  Also, a Starbucks across the street to help start the day.

7) The madness of LA is just across the hill and is a short drive to Hollywood...  but Burbank is so insulated from the City, it feels like it is hours away.

8) Just a short drive to Burbank's shopping centers, so IKEA, Target/WalMart, Home Depot/Lowe's, Macy's, REI, and many more are within a few miles of AVA Burbank, without requiring a drive to Glendale or Los Angeles.

9) A short walk to the Burbank Media District...  Warner Brother's Studio is just down the street, and it is a quick hop to Disney Studios and NBC Comcast Universal, as well as the media production schools.

AND...

10) Just around the corner from the famous Bob's Big Boy!</Text>< Pics>

I worked with Brenden for my move and for working through the problems I had and he has been FANTASTIC.

<Text>While the apartment itself isn't quite up to par in terms of paint job and other details, and the "gym" isn't worth any consideration, the area is great and the staff are wonderful. Nathan was a great help and took the time to immediately solve a problem I had in the building. Amanda was also helpful during the move in process and quickly replied to emails. She also sent maintenance over to fix a problem with my window within an hour or two of lodging the complaint. Great staff, but i personally would say it is slightly overpriced (only by ~$100 a month) for what you get.< /Text><Rating>3</Rating>< user>

<Review>Great move in! I really enjoyed both Nathan and Amanda, they made my move exceptionally easy and were very helpful. The apartments have been renovated and were built in the 60's, so expect some of the "charm" that comes with 60 year old complexes.

<text>Moving in to the Ava in Burbank was a breeze. My girlfriend and I had an incredibly busy month of October ahead of us and Nino at the leasing office did everything he could to make it as painless as possible. They go to great lengths to be attentive and caring that anything you need will be taken care. The apartments themselves are stylish, clean and well-maintained. I haven't had to service anything yet but Caesar(?) the head of maintenance assured me he would take care of the moment anything came up. Great experience so far.</text><rating>5<//rating>< Time>

The worst experience ever. My wife and myself  literally left without an apartment that we were relying on very much, in ten days before our move in date.
In a month before our desired move in date we  filled out the application, paid a part of the security deposit to put it on hold, were approved. At that time the apartment wasn’t available to look at it, somebody still lived there, so I was waiting for a call from the office management and the moment when we could finally look at it and sign the contract. I didn’t get any phone call from Oliver (the person we spoke about the apartment), which he promised to make, so we decided to stop by and guess what we found out?..  this apartment has already been rented! I would not recommend you to trust these people, especially Oliver.
And the worst thing is that they didn't even try to fix their mistake. They don’t really care that they put people in that situation.< /Text>

<text>Moved in recently, everything went really smooth. Nathan Crosby is the man. He took care of the whole process really well and was always there to address my concerns.

I've seen a few negative reviews about loud noise, cleanliness, safety etc. I'm not sure what community on this planet won't have an issue with these things when you've hundreds of units/residents in a community. Rents are a little high, otherwise this community deserves a FIVE star rating.<//text><user>104483693881060611266<//user><pics>None</pics>< Time>

It has been a great experience so far living in this quite neighborhood. Nice pool and gym facilities. My daughter loves the pool. Wish there was a kids play area. The staff has been nothing but friendly every time.

Secure and well maintained. Interesting events happen once a while.

I feel it is a little expensive though, otherwise I would love to upgrade to a 2 bed soon :)< /review>

I have been living in AVA Burbank since last four years. The entire office staff is really helpful & professional. Especially Amanda! Recently, I had a problem with some service but it was handled so well by Amanda that I didn't focus on the problem, but the fact that her efficiency made me feel like it was a priority to get it taken care of.

I would highly recommend AVA-Burbank to people looking for a great, peaceful & safe environment.< /Review>

The staff here and maintenance crew are super friendly and helpful.  Say hi to Ashlee when you go by the office :)  Location is safe and amazing.  We walk everywhere.  Street parking nearby is always available.  The price is a bit high but you're paying for the location.  The only issue I have is that broken chairs at the pool and grill area have been taken away and not replaced, leaving only 3 pool chairs for the entire building.  Overall, we have loved living here.  It has been a great place for my intro to LA.<//text>

JoJo is apart of the Ava crew and has been exceptionally amazing.  He goes above and beyond to make sure that the residents at AVA feel that they have the best service when it comes to their home and any issues we've had. We've had small problems that needed to be fixed in the home and JoJo came in promptly and fixed the problem within minutes.  He has such a warm and inviting personality and makes you feel special.  He works so hard and I hope he gets the praise he deserves!!!< /review>

Be Aware Residences of AVA. Sadly, we just saw that our neighbor rented the place on airbnb and tons of weirdos caused hovac here. When my husband asked who are these people they indicated it is not our business and they are staying at some kind of a student housing company rooms. This is disheartening and very dangerous to my kids since these people could be anyone. I see on the review some other tenants also raised these issues in other ava properties.
Consider these issues before committing paying top dollar to stay at AVA properties.  I mean who does this nowadays ? allowing some companies to rent your property as if it is a motel.. just crazy< /Review>

<Text>Thank you to Ricardo who works so hard everyday keeping our common area and parking area so clean. The BBQ is always spotless, he attends to spills (cat litter trail ) right away, cleans sticky tree sap off front area, keeps the stairs clean so there are no safety issues, and many more things. I have never lived in a community that was so clean and well cared for before!!!</Text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I've been here 3.5 years now and haven't had any complaints. I remember reading negative reviews before I moved in here but none of them have been part of my experience. The guys at the leasing office (special shout out to Nathan) have been nothing but courteous and helpful. Tania has been here as long as I have, which shows the consistency and loyalty the employees show to the company, always a good sign.

Maintenance is another huge reason why my wife and I are so happy here. They respond immediately and remember me by name, even though I don't see them more than once every few months! My pool is always cleaned by a wonderful man named Angel, who also remembers me and does an excellent job.

The area is kept safe by security. The grounds are cleaned very often. Improvements to the community are done on a routine basis (my building was just painted and the doors to the parking garages were all replaced). They even added better lighting to the garage to add a vital bit of security.

All in all, I've been blessed to have this place as my first apartment in Los Angeles. I hope to be able to stay here a while longer until I'm able to afford my own house. Even with that said, my next-door neighbors have been here 20(!) years, so this is obviously a place that engenders that type of settling down.

Edit: I wrote that review in 2018. Since then, I have moved out and back. The maintenance crew is still top notch. I'd like to give a shout-out to Luis Alatorre, who embodies the kindness and high-quality service I've received from maintenance in my time here.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

The staff here and maintenance crew are super friendly and helpful.  Say hi to Ashlee when you go by the office :)  Location is safe and amazing.  We walk everywhere.  Street parking nearby is always available.  The price is a bit high but you're paying for the location.  The only issue I have is that broken chairs at the pool and grill area have been taken away and not replaced, leaving only 3 pool chairs for the entire building.  Overall, we have loved living here.  It has been a great place for my intro to LA.< /review>

I’ve been with AVA for a little over a year now. I have NEVER experienced such an amazing service from anyone in this community like the one that JOJO provided today assisting with a maintaince request. He was quick to solve the issue had a great attitude and provided great customer service. Learned that he is new with the company and I am so happy he joined! Hopefully his positivity and customer service skills are contengius within the rest of his team.<//review>

I lived there in 2014 to 2016.
- Don’t choose a room with only 1 A/C in the living room because it’s gonna be too hot on summer. Also, tons of bugs appear on summer in the bedroom which is very annoying.
- When I asked them to have an extra parking they gave me a parking that someone already used, And I talked to them and they gave me my money back on that time and this is not the issue.
- The issue is When I was leaving, in my last day there I gave them my home address to send me my deposit check but they don’t send it.. “THEY DONE RETURN MY DEPOSIT UNTIL Now “ I graduated and went back to my country!! I don’t recommend this apartments..<//text>

The entire staff here at Ava Burbank has been very helpful during my move. Especially Sydney one of the property managers who called when I was starting to get stressed during my apartment hunting process. This lady even gave up her lunch break to show me the apartment. She showed me another unit that was very different than my original tour. It was perfect and had all the amenitites I wanted. She processed my application quickly and addressed all maintenance my concerns. Her timing couldn't have been better. She was very professional and listened to what I was looking for.

Also the maintenance guy who made some touchups while I was in Northern CA put my delivered mail inside the door. Ava Burbank was an excellent choice and I should be here for awhile.<//review>

I truly enjoy living at Ava Burbank Apartments, it's conveniently located for both shopping, dining and for work, my only reason for not ranking it higher is because although the apartments have been updated, they are OK but seem too expensive for what you get.  Also, the gym at my location at Kling and Pass is just mediocre.  The leasing staff, management and maintenance folks are amazing and very helpful and they definitely lessen the second thoughts I have each month when I pay rent.<//text>

I am currently a resident at AVA Burbank. The overall experience of living in this place is very satisfying. Great servise and very helpfyll, friendly staff. Espesially I want to mention JOJO from  the housing repair staff. We had an emergency at our apartment,  he came right away and fixed the problem very quickly and qualitatively. I was also very pleased to have somebody professional and respectful as him to take care of our problem. As he said "We are here to help you any moment!"</text>

BUYER BEWARE.
OVERPRICED & AWFUL

It seems as if AVA is up to some dirty tricks. If you read through their 358 reviews, you will see that there aren't a whole lot with 4 or less stars. Also, it's the same type of language in each review AND the accounts here only have 1-2 reviews total! I'm only theorizing, but I would bet money that this apartment complex is trying to boost their image with paid reviews.

I lived here for a year in one of their studio apartments. It was an absolute nightmare for $1745 there was no dishwasher and it was built cheaply. If you live on the bottom floor, you're going to hear your upstairs neighbor constantly.

There's a lot of film students here too, so you get a lot of wild and loud poolside parties that management does little to nothing about. Plus, people keep leaving the main building door open or vandalize it so it wont work. There were also multiple car robberies in the carports.

Then management sends out passive aggressive emails about these issues without taking any direct action. However, it was completely worthwhile to harass and accuse me of dumping "personal" trash in mail recycle bins.

I called management and maintenance to let them know that it wasn't me and they ended up giving me a lecture on how I need to understand that doing that causes bugs so they MUST investigate and we were at fault so that's why they reached out. No matter how many times I explained I wasn't the culprit, they refused to apologize and kept insisting I was.

They sent a picture of proof showing that our trash was in the mail. Turns out it was a bunch of old envelopes FROM the mail in a baggie that caused them to freak out.

So, I got basically letured for putting mail trash in the mail area recycling bin!!!

I was renting a studio and managed to find a very nice apartment complex not too far away that was a 1 bedroom for $1695! Can you believe that !? Same and a 1bedroom for less than my studio!?

Just goes to show you what a rip off AVA is.< /review>

I live in a townhouse and it is great! We have plenty of space and a little patio even. The only reason I give it 4 stars and not 5 is because after our first lease was up our rent got raised an extremely significant amount and while we love living here and asked for negotiations they were not so accommodating. Other than the very high cost of living here it is great! Just wish it was a little more affordable. JoJo from the maintenance team is FANTASTIC! He is uber polite and courteous and does his job well.</review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Review>1- building are old and the increased of the rent every year without any adjust or improvement in the building or gym, is totally unfair.
2- some of the front office worker are not polite, also each resident have a different treatment, which is very bad because we all are suppose to have the same right and benefits
3- there is a equipment at their gym which is been broke since November 2015, more than 1 year, and i have been asking them to fix and they are giving so many excuses and of course not fixing.
4 - In my 2o year here as a resident, I had a problem with one of mine old roommates that has a dog. they charged us the fee($50) of the dog and also they charged us $500 as a safety deposit for the dog. we paid and after couples months my old roommate and his dog left our apt as well. me and mine roommates went to the front office and we asked about our $500 dog deposit, they told us that they COULD NOT give the $500 BACK to us, because we were still living in the apt. however, they said that they would give the $500 back once our lease expired and we are out of the apt. it is  been 2 days since we have left and i personally went to the front office to ask about our safety deposit and also the dog safety deposit, and i had a HUGE SURPRISE. i was told that those $500 from the dog deposit was not there on my account, the money somehow just disappeared from our account. now i have to call customers cares, because the front office(the same one that told me and my roommates that we would get both deposit when we leave the apt) CANNOT help us out in this situation. they just took our money and moved to different transactions without our knowledge, and now the $500 we were counting it is not there anymore.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Ashley is amazing, she should be employee of the year!  She has went above and beyond the call of duty. I truly appreciate her help from when my car was stolen from my parking and my girlfriends car was broken into. Ashley has been a true gem.</Review>

We're very grateful that you've shared that moment with us, and I will share it with Nathan, Crystal and the on-site team. In the meantime, I just wanted to say thank you for sharing!"}< /Resp><text>We found Ava on Google maps and loved the proximity to "everything." Grocery 24 hours, food, freeways.We had already put a hold on another place but are moving in here.

My wife first toured with Nathan and had great things to say about him. She said he was very friendly and full of positive energy.

Our next tour was with Crystal (Nathan was off), she is new but held her own while working through the many buildings of Ava. She was friendly and showed is a lot of units. At the time the town house we would end up taking wasn't available.

After a day or so, we noticed a town house had opened up and we set a tour with Nathan to view it. This was my first time meeting Nathan and he was every bit of what my wife described him as. He even greeted every person by name that walked through the lobby. Many of the residents took time to tell him hello before he noticed them. Ava is lucky to have him.

The buildings themselves are a bit older, but well kept up. Ava offered three types of units, base, premium and upgraded. Which suggest they are upgrading units as residents move out. We have laundry in our town house, but the laundry on site is newer side loading LG washer and dryer. They don't take coins either, so no more bothering the store for quarters!

I picked up keys today with Oliver. He is friendly and noticed I seemed to be in a  it of a rush. He allowed me to open up the town house so the cable guy could get to work. While I was with the cable guy he started get some paper work out of the way to save me time. GREATLY APPRECIATED!

Our overall experience has been great with Ava and we look forward to staying here until we buy a house.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< userid>

I can't say enough good things about AVA Burbank. All of the community consultants have been super helpful from the start, helped me out to have a smooth move-in day and are there to answer any questions I have. The studio in which I am staying was very clean, spacious and the community as a whole is fantastic. Haven't used the pools yet but the gym is fully stacked with anything you need. But at the end of the day the community consultants i.e. Ashlee, Nick and everyone make AVA a great place to be with a cool relaxed atmosphere. Just wanna say thanks, you guys are awesome.</review>

I recently worked with Amanda at the Ava to get an apartment for my daughter.  She made the process very easy and answered all of my questions.  The Ava Burbank has a unique layout that provides for small communities within each building.  The area is conveniently located near a shopping center and the freeway.<//text>

Nice and overpriced.

I like having a private pool.

Younger crowd.

I never see the security patrol aside one time where he was untucked and it looked like someone woke him from a nap.

A steady police presence in the area, (responding to calls...they don't live here).

Overall, nice. But the price is for what you get is unreasonable. 1980 for a one bedroom with nothing included. Better off with a mortgage.</Review>

I’ve only been here for a year and the experience here has been nothing but amazing. Any problem is fixed immediately, and the front office is very helpful and welcoming. Nino was our contact from the beginning and to our last days in the apartment. He was very helpful and understanding. He made it difficult to leave  Ava apartments.

<Text>I signed a one year lease and ended up staying barely making it a month. You see, while they advertise renovated apartments they really just slap on a new coat of paint every time someone moves out. The walls are paper thin. Let me actually be honest. I moved out because my upstairs neighbors were so loud that living underneath them was impossible. If someone above you has a dog, you'll hear it. If people around you are having guests over, you'll hear it.

Had my boyfriend ask management to do something about it, but of course nothing changed. After barely sleeping for 2 weeks it was time to leave.

I had ants crawling out of my bathtub two days after the move in date even though the bathroom was still clean.

Don't do it. Overpriced for what you get. Looks way nicer than what you actually end up getting.

Sales team is incredibly good at their jobs, though. And try to be helpful. But there's only so much you can do when the apartment itself is faulty and so are your neighbors.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>
{'time': 1503346479958, 'text': "Anika, I’m so sorry to hear you feel the price and our community are out of step. We take a lot of factors into account when determining pricing, and customer feedback is among them. We'll definitely consider this moving forward. Noise concerns are often the hardest concern for a community to resolve, because they involve a dispute between residents. We work hard to make sure both that our residents are comfortable, and that community rules are enforced. It sounds like your experience wasn't a good one, so we will revisit the situation to make sure we really are addressing this issue to the best of our ability.

Nino done a good job!  Very good apartment, he is very nice and answer us many question. We check the room three time, and every time he is very patient. He help us to do all the process, and give us a good advice about living in us. It is a first time for me to rent a apartment in US, and I have a supergood experience.</text>

If you're looking to stay in a nice area & place in very short amount of time, I highly suggest contacting Ashlee Holzer. Not only was she extremely polite & professional, she was very accomadating & helpful in choosing the right place for me. She made the whole experience of moving from Chicago to Burbank CA comforting & reliable, if I ever had to redo this experience she'd be my first choice every time. & she gives great recommendations for restaurants. If you see her, mention Nathan sent you & she'll work out a special deal for you.</review>

The in unit wash is a plus. The walls are paper thin. Waking up everyday to my neighbor snoring is not ideal. The community is primarily college students so be prepared for parties and drunk yelling at 3:00 am. Overall I don't think it's worth the money per month. If you're new to LA and are not sure where to be, this is a good start.<//review></record>

I’ve lived in AVA Burbank ever since I move to California which makes 5 months now and I’ve alwaye observed the leasing agents level of customer satisfaction and meticulosity to be exceptional! I’ve so appreciated having such an attentive office to support my living situation! Nino demonstrates a very high level of willingness to assist the residents in anyway he can and has obvious outstanding and professional problem-resolution skills! Thank you to AVA and Nino!<//text>

<review>The staff is GREAT, but the buildings and windows are so old there's absolutely no noise insulation. If you are a light sleeper or have a baby, do not even consider moving here. They did superficial updates, so it looks like it's been renovated, but it hasn't where it counts. We've had to submit COUNTLESS work orders for things not working in and around the apartment. The gym seems nice, but it's certainly not membership quality, and machines are constantly broken. Plus, if you've finally had enough and want to get out before your lease is up, they charge 2 months rent to break your lease. We have the worst, most inconsiderate upstairs neighbor right now who constantly wakes our 6 month old throughout the night, and we are stuck here for another 5 months because money is more important than compassion to a big corporation like Avalon. The pool is nice and well-kept and the neighborhood is amazing, but the apartments themselves are too run down and poorly constructed for the premium price tag they charge for them. If you have any other choice, don't move here.< /review>< pictures>

Overpriced compared to local competition. Built in 60's - creaky floors, no central air-heat, single pane windows, unusually loud footfall from overhead apts. Good appliances.<//review>

<Review>Moving is a giant pain in the ass, up there with job searching and online dating. And of course, apartment hunting is best done at a frenzied, panicky pace of a coke fiend. AVA Burbank has made my move a smoother process. Nathan was kind enough to shuttle my lazy ass around in a golf cart to multiple apartments. He was really focused on making sure I found an apartment that suited me really well. Nino Yambao was excellent and very professional for my move in day. He explained the process to me calmly using small, simple words that could get through my panic mode brain and was very patient with me when I freaked out. I highly recommend working with Nino if you can.

It is great that there are so many team members to assist you on site but sometimes communication gets dropped or emails go unreplied which is common with big teams. But when I did call, everyone has been receptive and helpful. Thanks AVA Burbank team  for making this miserable process, less miserable!</Review>< pictures>

<date>1484003574341</date><rating>5<//rating><review>I had a really awesome experience working with Nino in the Ava Burbank Office. He called me with great news about an available garage/carport that would suit my needs. The space is within the same building as my apartment. It is very spacious, clean, and accomodating for my new vehicle. Nino was really awesome and placed in a quick 24 hour service request so that I could recieve the additional keys and information pertinent to my request. I'd like to thank Nino for his dedicated service to myself and the other Ava Burbank tenants. He is my favorite in the office because he always greets you when you come in and is very attentive to your questions and requests. If you ever need anything, be sure to ask for him!<//review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

I am an international student from China, and I will study in LA for two year!  I have to rent an apartment before the beginning of my class, but I actually don't be familiar with Burbank. And then I met Nino Yambao, the community consultant in the AVA BURBANK. Nino showed  me around enthusiastically and introduced many relevant information about the apartment, he helped me a lot! Also, Nino's working process was very professional and high efficient. At last, he found the most suitable apartment for me, and the surrounding is nice, beautiful safe and quite, which is beneficial to a student who is just come to the beginning. I really appreciate Nino yambao and AVA BURBANK.<//text>

Nino was very helpful during my transition and move to LA. Coming from a small town in Michigan I didn't know what to expect, but Nino and his service made everything comfortable and easy. Nino showed me around the complex and showed me where other stores are in the area (Grocery, Target, etc). Nino personally gave me his business card with is phone number and email on it just incase I have any questions about the apartment complex. So far so good!<//Text>

I have been living here for more than  5 years and have had a great experience so far. Special thanks to Romeo in the leasing office for just being super warm and friendly whenever we've needed anything. Romeo went above and beyond to help me find the right garage  for my SUV.  Much Appreciated for the Level of Service Romeo .<//text>

(Translated by Google) I felt welcome here. I was helped by Nino and he took great care of me and my girlfriend. we weren't sure if we would move to Burbank and he went out of his way to show all the benefits of AVA. GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE !!!

Je me suis senti le bienvenu ici. J'ai été aidé par Nino et il a pris grand soin de moi et de ma petite amie. nous n'étions pas sûrs de déménager à Burbank et il s'est mis en quatre pour montrer tous les avantages d'AVA. GRAND SERVICE À LA CLIENTÈLE ​​!!!</Review>

Was recently out of town visiting some friends who moved to Lompoc! They recommended I try out Elevate! Walking in the doors was greeted and quickly paired with Miguel to show me around and brief me on the latest deals! Quickly found what I wanted to try and was so surprised by the knowledgeable staff and how friendly they are! Great deals dank bud and good vibes I’d say it’s a WIN 🙌 great way to start off the year a new shop I’ll be traveling to shop at!</Text>

This place is the best in town! The people are nice and the amount of different options you have is excellent. Plus they have a really good discount happening most of the time. Check it out next time! Wait... Maybe go somewhere else so this place doesn't get too busy lol lol</review>

<Review>From the moment I entered their establishment,  everyone was friendly and courteous.  I went in there a "newbie ", desperate for relief from my chronic pain and anxiety.  I didn't know what to get at all. I asked a lot of questions and they were really patient,  and helpful. They made several recommendations,  of which I am most grateful for.
I will definitely be coming back here again.<//Review>< Rating>

<review>I came in to elevate on my birthday, and it was a great experience. I ordered online and scheduled a pick-up, but it was late and I live in orcutt... I wasn’t going to arrive until right at 10, when they close. I called to let them know I was on my way, hoping they’d wait so I could make my $500 purchase. They did, and the staff was very friendly! I got 2 nice-sized joints for free as well, and I saved over $150. One of the ladies also gave me a birthday crown, it was cute. I’ll be back!</review>< resp>

<Text>Fantastic staff! Everyone is so helpful and attentive to our needs every time we go! I love how each time we go it’s a great experience. The staff is also super knowledgeable about everything which helps fill in the gaps when we don’t have an exact idea of what we need but a vague sense of it. Wholeheartedly recommend coming here.</Text>< Pictures>

Got a txt from someone named Anthony saying my order would be delivered by 8-830pm they were waiting on a driver or they can make it an in person pickup. I sent a txt right back saying delivery is fine. Then I get a missed call. I call back less then a minute after the call and get told my order was canceled. They should have a minimum call back time before they go canceling orders. I’m writing this review so that they won’t do this sh** again.<//Text>

Decent product, but their delivery service has become incredibly undependable.  3-4 times of ordering hours before cut off just to get a message that they can't deliver today.  I use cannabis as a medicine and reliability is very important.

Also important is that I've spent a ton of money there, but still don't get good service.</review>

Every day there is a rotating discount. It sets this particular dispensary apart from others. Factor in their special events and holiday discounts, product reps who stop by regularly, range and variety of products and employee know how and dedication to customer satisfaction, it really sets Elevate apart from other dispensaries around. Elevate gets my vote every time.</text>

Drive 2hrs Every Weekend To Elevate For Their AWESOME DEALS! The Way Their Displays Are Set Up Is Way Better Then What We Have Out Here... As A First Time Experience, I Was Treated Nicely By The Receptionist As Well As My Bud Tender (MR. VILLA).  I Believe His Name Was... He Kindly Asked Me What I Was Looking For And Directed Me In The Right Path. From Now On ELEVATE Is My GO 2 DISPENSARY. Great Service And Their DELIVERY Guy (MIGUEL) is AMAZING! Don’t Feel Like Driving/Getting Up NO PROBLEM! Look Up Elevates Menu, Get Your Delivery Prompt, Accurate, Professional.<//Review></record>

Got roped in by a 'buy one eighth get one for $5 deal' because I wanted something nice while I'm waiting for my crops to be ready for harvest. Ended up costing me $70 after the deal because it was a $55 eighth. I was surprised and asked the guy what's up. He said "it's super top shelf. The best flower we have in the shop." I get home and try it. It's literally just some alright greenhouse-grown. I would go as far as to call it good, but by no means top shelf or great. Definitely will not be returning if this is their best. Looks like I got tricked into buying some overpriced stuff that they wanted to get off the shelves faster. Oh well. I recommend getting people with more cannabis knowledge and experience, especially in regards to whoever handles acquisitions.
Extra star was because the customer service was good aside from that. Update: they just called me while I was at work. I called right back and they said they didn't call me....childish.< /Text>

I often visit town from Sacramento and whenever I'm in the area I stop by.

I'm always greeted by reception with a smile on their face.
Followed up with great customer service from a knowledgeable budtender Victor.

their prices are extremely fair and they keep you coming in with their many different promos.

What sets this dispensary apart is that it feels like they have the customer's interest more then just trying to make a  quick buck!</text>

<review>Horrible customer service. There is a way to handle business but with issues that could have been handled appropriately, they dropped the ball. The issue was more with the lack of professionalism from the security gaurd, which could have made the experience much better. Since, there are more than 5 other dispensaries with better prices, this place is not worth it. Greenhouse or Seaweed are better choices.<//review><Rate>1< /Rate><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Name>Irvin Vides< /Name></record>

The prices are pretty high and the staff aren't very well trained and at times condescending. Also, two of my products were passed the "Best By" date on the package but no compensation was offered when I brought it to their attention. I won't be returning unless a last resort.< /Text>

Honestly the store itself on the inside is just mesmerizing. It is so peaceful and relaxing. You have your own personal person that works just with you while you are there. Very kind and knowledgeable staff. Product is great. Other shops give you small amounts for the same price when this place gives you the full amount you pay for. Love It !!!<//Review>

I have been to Elevate several times now and Jonathan has helped me out twice and he always makes you feel super comfortable. It's obvious how knowledgeable he is with the product and he never makes you feel rushed like some other shops. Elevate overall is very clean and organized, their rewards system is super awesome also!< /Text>

Super rude they don’t spend your money here. They don’t deserve it there are so many other dispensary’s that have way better deals and people manning their business. I’m disgustedly with how disrespectful they are to some one trying to spend money at their establishment!<//text>

<text>I used to come here all the time and over time i realized how rude and how quick they want you outve the door. When they have you wait longer than other dispensaries to get in . I asked the bud tender if i could look around during one of their specials and he told me "we have a lot of people waiting so if you know what u want already it would be better next time" Making me feel as if i could not look around .Felicia the receptionist doesnt seem as if she wants to help people ever . Rolling her eyes when people make the mistake of calling the store instead of the delivery line. Just dissapointed on how it went from a very welcoming environment at first to a get in and get out environment today.< /text>< Pics>

Everytime I come, I'm always welcomed by smiling faces and positive energy. The associates are knowledgeable about their products and I've always felt taken care of at this dispensary! The location is great and makes me feel safe. Customer service is extremely important to me and I've felt my needs have been met at Elevate! Thanks for opening here in Lompoc and hiring such enthusiastic employees!< /review>

Good people and good flowers. Really lucky to have them in Lompoc. Super clean facility and the largest selection of concentrates and cannabis I have seen. 5 stars, would recommend to anyone looking for good, clean cannabis with great service.</review>

Elevate Lompoc is the 3rd "Recreational" dispensary to open in Lompoc and Santa Barbara County and boasts itself as the largest in the county. It is a beautiful facility that has undergone expensive renovations and it has a beautiful decor and theme. The staff are friendly, courteous and knowledgable. Stop by and say hello in the heart of downtown Lompoc.<//Text>

I liked them, a bit too expensive for medical Cannabis users, otherwise a nice business,  great people. My only complaint is they need some cheaper low THC weed for those interested in pain relief.</text>

Went in for a 4pm deal today. I was greeted by rude "guards" , then was told if you have not received a text you must leave.  What wait list, nothing on the site about wait list or sign in. First time here , last time here.<//Review>
<Response>{'time': 1572051648016, 'text': 'https://www.waitlist.me/w/elevate  is our wait list which is also clearly listed on our homepage.  We also have a Kiosk inside that you would have been directed to sign into.  Come on back and ask for Tory and we will be happy to make things right!'}< /Response>< Date>

<review>Loved how clean and professional they are got invited by the owner rob and was highly impressed. The whole staff and crew are extremely friendly and helpful. Leading the pack in service forsure not a single step from check in to waiting to purchase was i ever alone without a smiling face to help love that everyone not only takes pride in their work but also know alot about their products. Thanks for the recommendation on that back seat jack btw it's 🔥🔥🔥I'll be back for more soon< /review>< Pictures>

So excited for this new shop. It is very clean, organized well and nicely decorated. The best part were the bud tenders! Vic and Larry helped me out getting a delish pre roll from Flow Kana - CBD Rose Queen (I highly recommend) Thanks for all the help and i'll be back soon!<//Review>

<gmapID>0x80ec1f42d476e34d:0xa84ac1c70d56b268< /gmapID><text>So me and my fiancé just stopped by for the first time the other day and today first impression is wow it looks nice in there! They have a nice selection in cartridges and etc. we got the live resin Berry Punch, super smooth tasting. And I took a little glance at the pre roll section and there was some huge pre rolls, even ones that come with a free ash tray. Will definitely be trying some pre rolls here soon! 🤩 and last but not least can’t wait to go to the grand opening this Friday!! Super excited I heard there’s going to be DEALS!! DEALS!! DEALS!! 🥳🥳</text>< user_id>

I went to this pet shop a few weeks ago to get items for my cute puppy. I was ecstatic to learn that this could be achieved at such a low rate. I've already expressed my appreciation for your team's helpful approach. What a clever method! I admire your positive attitude and inspiration. Thank you so much!</Review>

<review>Pet Food Express on Market is a great place to buy pet food supplies, treats, and toys. That I expected. What pleasantly surprised me was the fact that there is an on-site vet, a pet wash station, staff that LOVES pets, and a handy scale to weigh your pet (and prove your frie ds wrong who assumed your Pomeranian was 20lbs when she is not even 10!).

I highly recommend this place.<//review><name>Bill Tickner</name><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPr3kDsR3igrVGWhy33NRdVOxvOdV7wuLluE_dn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><gmapID>0x808f7e1fd1df26a3:0x8726ffb630e8eb44<//gmapID>< Date>

Great friendly customer service. Been there 4 times - a great experience every time! The dog washing station is awesome... No wonder they're one of the few pet stores left.</Review>

As new dog owners, we were so impressed by Darryl and his team’s awesome customer service! The team members were attentive, knowledgeable and caring - we left the store feeling informed and supported. Thank you to Darryl and his team for boosting our confidence! We are truly grateful.</Review>

I stopped in for some fish supplies which they dont carry.  They primarily focus on dogs and cats.  Large inventory of food and supplies for both.  You can also adopt a pet at this location. Self serve pet washing area as well.  Very helpful friendly staff.< /Text>

They have a great selection. We found everything we were looking for except frozen raw cat food. The prices were not too bad either for San Francisco.
My cat hung out in the shopping cart and was very curious about everything and everyone there. She doesn't get out much so it was nice for her. We will definitely be back and I will get pictures next time.<//text>

Their prices are a little higher than most places but you buy 3 you get one free. So it's kind of like Costco in this sense. They have an amazing dog wash. It cost 15 bucks but it's awesome.</review>

I had one of the best customer service experiences in my life at Pet Food Express, during a particularly difficult period of time. We unfortunately had to surrender our dog, and we came in to see if we could just donate our food and some of the toys that our little pup played with. We weren't even asking for a refund, but just wanted their suggestions on where to donate our stuff! The staff at Pet Food Express was SO NICE! They gave us a full refund on everything (used, unused, it didn't matter), and they didn't even ask for our receipts. They were so supportive, and told us that they understand how difficult this is for people. I can't recommend the store enough - you're really getting the best with them.< /Text>

Everything you would want from a place that helps you do what's best for your pets.
We have and old cat that has decided to be very picky about her food.
Her favorites are no longer her favorites.
Pet Food Express was great about letting us take multiple options home and she what she liked best.
What didn't work, they just asked that we washout the cans, keep our receipts and they refunded us whatever she wouldn't eat... It was in the dozens before we mailed it down.
They returned anything she don't like, no questions. Life savers, really.
Thank you<//Review>

Loved the wide aisle, friendly staff, very helpful but not pushy. The selection is vast and the store is clean and neat.  Price clearly marked. Saw a lot of pet owners with their dogs walking around. Parking is good for San Francisco. Take your dog, cat, or any pet and go here for your pet's every need. They even groom.  🤩🤗😍< /review>

PFE is the best with well trained and caring staff.  It's a bit pricey,  but buy 3 and get the 4th free of anything.  That helps.  For $5, they will deliver to you.  They sell high quality food for your pets and they will help you figure out what to try if you have finicky cats like I do.  Highly recommend PFE for pet owners who want nothing but the best for their animals!<//review>

Pet Food Express has great employees. They keep everything clean. They have cats up for adoption. Lots of supplies for cats and dogs. Best of all they have a room for VIP animal care there. You can get your animals their shots and a check up. Their staff are all so nice and helpful. They are  inexpensive and first come first serve. I have used them for my cats for years. Love them.<//text>

She is super knowledgable, gave us advice based on her experience with her cat, and knew the best types of food, litter, treats, toys, etc. Michelle is the best!!< /review><user_id>111508685122296415721<//user_id>< user_name>

I  spoke with a person named Michelle today who I have to take a second to mention. I gave her a complicated scenario regarding my older, sick dog who is having problems regarding his food, pooping, his health and other things. She listened very intently and gave me EXCELLENT advice. She interpreted my dog concerns and had intelligent suggestions and solutions.
Thank you Michelle and PFE!<//text>

The store was clean and not so busy and was more calm and relaxed for a big space. I could tell that the employees I spoke with really did care and not just make up whatever.

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>I’ve been coming to this location for several years now. I’ve lived all over the city but always take the trip here. Parking is tight and a little uncomfortable, but I’ve always gotten a spot. I get Origin dog food which is hard to find and they carry it, the main reason I go there. I used to also get Tiki Dog wet dog food which they had suggested a while back as a high end wet food. I and my dog loved them! It was human grade with little shrimps on top! But they recently stopped carrying these, which is a bummer. The toy selection is great and high quality. Whenever I give in and buy a toy elsewhere it’s destroyed in days vs. months. Lastly they are always staffed well and very helpful! They also have a large bath area and professional grooming. Great place!<//Review>< Pics>

PFE is the best with well trained and caring staff.  It's a bit pricey,  but buy 3 and get the 4th free of anything.  That helps.  For $5, they will deliver to you.  They sell high quality food for your pets and they will help you figure out what to try if you have finicky cats like I do.  Highly recommend PFE for pet owners who want nothing but the best for their animals!<//review>

The Team was absolutely amazing! I meant to write this a week ago, but just now getting to it. I was greeted with an prompt & attentive warm welcome by a lovele lady with red hair as soon as I entered. Furthermore a very pleasant and knowledgeable team member by the name of Angie I believe was awsome! She politely inserted herself into my shopping experience, kindly help me decide on more things then I even came in for. I'm usually in and out and on my way, but this was a memorable experience as she and others continued to assist me; when I assumed I never even needed help. What a great display of being proactive and a strong customer experience. Thank You Guys!<//Review>

My dog loves it so therefore all of it. Is dog wash is high class and functional although the shampoo could be just a little bit more generous. A good place to go to find some treats for your pet</Text>

<Text>Great selection of healthy foods for your pets. The food is on the more expensive side, but it’s all very good quality. They also sell specialty foods for dogs on specific diets.

Their range of leashes, toys, accessories etc. is better than most pet shops and the prices are average. We’ve also used their pet washing stations, which are easy to use and well-equipped with different shampoos, aprons, towels.

What I love here is that there’s always a lot of staff on duty, and it’s super easy to find someone to help out. They’re really friendly and great with animals too.<//Text></record>

3 stars only because the older asian gal with freckles all over her face who rung me up just stood there as my hands were full with a dog leash in one and my wallet in the other. She didn’t even help me bag my cans that I just bought. Rude. Other than that this is a cool store.<//Review>

Absolutely an amazing pet store for those who love their pets. The pet store has not only a friendly staff, but everything you want to lavish your pet with from treats, food and wearables. There's also a vet clinic on property for shots, nail clipping and check up. You and your pet will definitely enjoy a shopping experience together!</review>

I love Pet Food Express.
Always super friendly & knowledgeable staff ready to help or answer questions.
I also love how they offer the healthiest food & treat options (no corn, wheat,  soy, or animal byproducts are sold in their stores.)
I also love their "Buy 3 of an item & you get the 4th item free."
They definitely charge more than a PetCo or PetSmart, but you get what you pay for, right?<//Review>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>Great service, all kinds of products, knowledgeable staff and everything else Rascal and I could ever need! Store is always clean, well stocked and I have had good luck with parking (so far).

Love the self wash - with a pug you gotta wash them often or they get smelly. I treat my baby to a spa every now and then, but groomers charge a lot for full service when all I really need is wash and dry. My vet does his ears, glands and nails - so in the long run it saves me a lot of money!!< /text>< user_id>

<Text>Picked up a large sack of dog food and proceeded to get a layer of sheetrock  dust all over my clothes .  I tried to brush it off, but it was too thick.  The cashier got me a wet cloth.  That didn't work. To compensate me for my trouble, they gave me a 20% discount.  Accidents happen.  Pet Food Express tried to fix its mistake.<//Text>< pics>

Staffing at this store has dramatically improved.  They are much more helpful.  Prices also seem to be a bit more reasonable.  Definitely they are moving in the right direction.<//Review>

As soon as I walked in the store, an employee asked if he could help me. I had never been there before and wasn't familiar with the product I was purchasing so I happily gave the product name I needed. He said its over there and points. This store is huge and over there doesn't do much. Few crew on floor but then I was able to get a woman to take me right to the product.<//text>

Picked up a large sack of dog food and proceeded to get a layer of sheetrock  dust all over my clothes .  I tried to brush it off, but it was too thick.  The cashier got me a wet cloth.  That didn't work. To compensate me for my trouble, they gave me a 20% discount.  Accidents happen.  Pet Food Express tried to fix its mistake.</Text>

Don't forget, most food and treats are but 3 get 4th free! This store is pet friendly, all natural, no chemical additives, stocks frozen and raw food and has a self service day wash. If you are a PAWS non profit client, they have a volunteer dog wash for free at least once a month.<//text>

An incredibly educated team that is  always willing to lend a helping hand.  Find their products to be a little more on the pricey side, however I've never been disappointed in the quality of the products I've purchased.< /review>

I love this pet store because:
When we adopted out puppy from ACC (The Dog Pound) they sent us here  with a coupon. Pet Food Express donates food to the shelter. Adopt today!

All the staff are very friendly.
It's a very local vibe but with the consistency of a chain store.< /text>

We visited from out of town and needed dog food for our pup.  She is a finicky eater so we didnt want to have to switch her dog food.  Luckily they carry Wellness Core, its a bit$$$ but worth every kibble!  Easy to find and easy parking!< /Text>

<Review>The staff are always friendly but the store seems to rotate thru brands too often. I'll find something my dog loves and then a couple visits later, they won't carry it anymore. Otherwise, the store is always clean and inviting.<//Review>< rate>

Great staff! Also, if you don't have the space to wash your pet in your home, you can take them here and they have a large bath area in the back. If the machine you are using runs out of soap, ask the front desk to give you a shampoo bottle.< /review>

They were so nice, it was raining , "cats and dogs" so I thought let me get into Pet Good Express, haha.
I went looking for some treats , and bought some nice $ ones that ny "friend " didn't like them ! Thankgoodness for my friends's dog , maybe they will eat them.
The quality of their service is great , and I know that they have food that will make any pet happy.< /review>

The walk in pet clinic is a life saver and it nice on the wallet. Just no cash is taken so one must pay with card.</Text>

I shop at many PFEs, and I've always had a great experience. The staff is friendly and very knowledgeable about all the products, especially the food. PFE has a large selection of premium pet food including frozen and freeze-dried raw food. They have a buy 3, get 1 free on cat and dog food and cat toys (and possibly other items). This location also has a kitty adoption center, so I always stop by to say hello. I'm a very price conscious buyer, but I don't even bother checking prices elsewhere (I think they price match, but they definitely take just about any coupon) because I like supporting this locally owned store, and I know they donate lots of food to the local shelters. There's an in-house VIP Pet Care Clinic open certain hours and a doggie wash area. And lastly, they have selections for other pets - birds, small mammals like my guinea pig, fish, and herps.<//Text>

Store that has broad spectrum of pet related items, has a wash your pup yourself station for  $15.-, towels, shampoo and apron for yourself included, a cat adoption program - I'm not sure if they work with the SPCA - however it's a bit priceyer than other pet stores<//Text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Children's products and snacks
This place is full. Unlike Korea, which is a chain store,
A variety of authentic certified products and products
It is not. When I look around, I want to load the carrier
I get too much ㅡ., ㅡ Good snacks and nutrients
There are also plenty of dogs and coin baths available.
It is like a city called a friend's paradise.
I wanted to learn Korea so much.
I will emphasize and emphasize the fact that there are a million peoples population.
I would like to have a professional dog breed culture
I feel whenever I visit.

반려견주라면 늘 고민하는 아이들 용품이나 간식
이 가득한 곳.  체인점이기도하고 한국과 달리 전
문성있는 인증된 용품들과 제품들이 다양하게 준
비되어 있다.  둘러보면 캐리어에 싣고 오고 싶은
게 너무 많이 생긴다ㅡ.,ㅡ 좋은 간식과 영양제
도 많고 반려견들 코인 목욕공간도 준비되어 있어
반려견 천국이라는 도시답게 배려깊은 공간도
구비되어 있어 한국도 크게 배울 점이다 싶었다.
천만 반려견 인구라는 점만 강조하고 자랑할게
아니라 전문적인 애견문화가 있었으면 함을 미국
방문 때마다 느낀다.<//Text><date>1551846221937<//date><name>남자박재현<//name><Rate>5</Rate><Pics>None<//Pics>< gmapID>

(Translated by Google) Good variety of products. They should train their employees a little more since they do not know how to recommend if they do not know what they sell ... Fortunately I am a veterinarian and I did not buy something that would not work if I had listened to what they said. Anyway there are some employees who do know that they are selling and corrected it.

(Original)
Buena variedad de productos. Deben entrenar un poco más a sus empleados ya que no saben recomendar si no saben lo que venden...Afortunadamente soy veterinaria y no compré  algo que no serviría si hubiera hecho caso de lo que decían. De todas formas hay algunos empleados que si saben que están vendiendo y lo corrigieron.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) I went to the clinic in the store. Medical examination and vaccination.
The female doctor kindly touched my dog.
No waiting time or appointment was needed.
