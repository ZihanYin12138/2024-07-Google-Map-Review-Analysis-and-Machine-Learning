< Review>
I cannot express how grateful and happy I am with the beyond amazing service I received today from Dr Charles Smurthwaite and his fantastic assistant Zoe. I had an emergency appointment today (on a Saturday)when my crown popped off my front tooth. I called the after hours phone number at 9 AM and by 10:30 AM my tooth was completely fixed!! I am all smiles today and it is thanks to these two amazing people😁</Review>

<Review>Great place. No one else in the area would see me when I was in excruciating pain and needed an emergency root canal. They saw me the same day I called and got the operation done very fast and saved my Christmas.<//Review>< Name>

Amazing staff, amazing doctor, overall just amazing. They fixed a lot of my teeth through a veterans program for free. I’m truly grateful for the people that work here and how much attention to detail they gave to me. Cannot express how great these people are and would recommend them for you and your family</Review>

I wanted to share with all of Smile quest future patients how wonderful this team is! My daughter and I switched Dentists about year ago. I picked Smile Quest and Dr Star. Started with cleaning's and x-rays. Which we were happy with. Then she had wisdow teeth pulled ☹ other then the normal after this. They did a great job. I especially love how Dr Star reaches out after to offer tips and well wishes! Fantastic all the way around! Thank you Dr Star & team!!<//Text>

I had a horrible experience with my previous dentist. I randomly started having tooth pain. That is when I needed to find a new dentist asap. When I saw the ratings for Smile Quest I immediately called to schedule an appointment. The rep on the phone was professional and patient with me. She was able to fit me in the schedule for the following day.
I loved the office. The team was very welcoming and friendly. I specifically would like to mention Jasmine. She did a great job and made me feel like I am in good hands. She gave me a tour and answered all of my questions. She was so polite and friendly. Also Dr. Smurthwaite is great. I truly felt like he cares about each and one of his patients.
I would definitely recommend Smile Quest Dental! You will not regret it. They are absolutely amazing.</review><Rate>5</Rate><Resp>{'time': 1598993656213, 'text': 'Hi Liliya!

Very professional office staff and also very welcoming and friendly.  The office itself is impressive with all high tech equipment. I especially like the ability to watch TV during the procedures. It is calming and takes your mind off the fact that you’re at the dentist. The dentists and hygienists are reassuring and always want to make sure the patient is comfortable and understands the procedure. I am new to the area and feel fortunate to have found such a wonderful and caring dental practice. I highly recommend them.< /Text>

Today I was blessed by this AWESOME team! Dr Starr and Jasmine are absolutely amazing. I broke a tooth the night before I was referred to them. I called the office first thing in the morning and they were able to squeeze me in. Not only were they able to examine the damage, but they were able to permanently fix my tooth. They have the ability to make crowns and put them in on the same day! No more temporary crowns. I highly recommend this office if you need anything done!<//Text>

<Review>Not happy today with smile quest Dental. I came in for a recement of a crown they made for me and promised me at that time that will should never come off like my last one. All I did was floss every night and it moved. Mind you I have another one for 21 years and never comes out. The made it in house and you would think it would last. They said they can’t give me a discount from $142 but only 5% is the best one they can do since they don’t take HMO. Since I go to another dentist that accepts HMO they clean it twice a year for free and monitors my teeth. They said they don’t talk to other dentist office in regards to my history so sounds like it’s my fault for not coming to them for 4 years. They took out my crown at 9:30 and sat for 2 hours waiting, hungry with no breakfast and had an EF (not dentist) do the re-cement.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>{'time': 1586901031668, 'text': "Hi Ann,\nWe're sorry you did not have a good experience with our practice.

I hate going to the dentist and had been avoiding it for some time. I had a crown go loose and they were able to fit me in very quickly and have me in a path to getting my problems fixed. I also had my first cleaning there and my hygienist was cautious and kind. They even offer massage chairs while waiting and paraffin wax treatments for your hands.</Text>

<text>I am so happy! Had a deep cleaning with Jillian and Dr Starr in attendance. My experience was first rate. The atmosphere in this office is outstanding. Everyone is friendly and attendant, it’s a joy to be greeted by all. As for the treatment, I am very satisfied with everything done so far. My only demand has been that I feel no pain or discomfort and Jillian and Dr Starr saw to just that. Kat checked me in and made me very comfortable until Jillian came in from lunch and I always feel like I am their extra special patient.

I have always dreaded going to the dentist, yet these folks have changed my opinion of dentistry as a whole. Their staff is super professional and provide first timers an office tour and really do a good job of explaining the experience you will receive.
I only have good things to say about every single person I have dealt with and have already given their name out to my coworkers and friends, which I personally have never done for a dentist, as I have never enjoyed my previous dental experiences prior to finding Smile Quest.< /text>< pictures>

I feel that they are using the latest technology to provide my care which I really like.  They caught problems that my previous dentist had missed and I have a plan now to improve my smile!

I have been going to Smile Quest for 6 years.  Both my daughters and 5 grandchildren also attend.  They are really great. All the hygienists are skilled and constantly ask how you are doing.  I have found their prices to be very competitive.  They are always on time with their appointments.  I couldn't ask for better dental care.</text>

My first initial consultation was about a month-and-a-half ago. I have been nothing but a hundred percent satisfied with the staff, accommodations, facility and overall cleanliness of the entire office. The plans they offer are super reasonable and the quality of work is outstanding!! Every dentist as well as practitioners we've met cares very much about their client's happiness, comfortableness and overall experience. Within less than 2 months I have moved our entire family over here. This will be our new dental home as long as we are in Northern California.< /Review>

The staff are very friendly and professional.  I recently had dental work done and the doctor called me after hours to check on me.  Most places would have their staff reach out but to actually have the doctor call to check on you is exceptional.  The office is clean, modern and they have the latest technology.   They offer and in house dental program for people like me who don't have traditional insurance because I'm self-employed. This has been a great option for our family.  5*<//review>

<Text>Every doctor and hygienist I’ve seen here are amazing! They always strive to give the best experience possible. My favorite part is they are VERY conservative in the treatment they prescribe, which is so refreshing! Many dentists recommend costly treatments, which are often not as high of a necessity as they make it seem; not here! These doctors are great and really care about what’s in your best interest!<//Text>< resp>

I have called multiple times with questions or to change my appointment around and they are always so helpful. The dentist that I met with was also very kind and gentle. I would definitely recommend this dental office to anyone looking for a new dentist!<//text>

Great place!  The staff is amazing!  Corinthia is incredibly helpful and Lacey is so great to work with and very nice.  Dr Collins is probably the best Dentist I've ever worked with.  Smile quest has done a great job of putting together an elite staff.  I've been going there for 5 years now and I don't think I've had a single bad experience.  I'm not just typing this for lip service. I never do reviews, but they most certainly deserve one. They also make the best cookies!<//Review>

It is very nice, modern building. I like extra room for kid to play and computer/games for young kids. Staff and Doctor are nice and professional. I would recommend for my friend and relative. Just a little thing, if they explained to me pior regarding a cap on the teeth which is not cover by ins. Other than that, they are great.< /Review>

I absolutely enjoy everyone I interact with at Smile Quest Dental in Rocklin. They are extremely courteous and professional. I've had the pleasure of seeing Dr. Starr, his assistant, Amanda and Holly, my hygienist. They are all wonderful people and help make you feel relaxed and comfortable as possible during your visit. I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a new Dentist Office.<//review>

I’m retired and have to drive 1 hour and 50 minutes to see Dr Smurthwaite. He’s been my dentist for Years and has given me the smile I share with you today. Before he changed my life with his gift of dentistry I was a wallflower always hiding my teeth and feeling less than. Well he did such a good job on my teeth years ago that he had to work twice as hard to work under the bridge he had put in so far back.  Patience and genuine care was given while waiting to see what we were going to do about this. You see he fit me in, rather than I be in pain,  he made a space for me. I mattered. Isn’t that what we all seek, just to be acknowledged as someone who needs care? He took the time and I am grateful to say that he’s my dentist. Thanks Doc, you’re the BEST!!! and Thanks to Mrs Doc and the kids for sharing him!< /Review>< Time>

Smile Quest Dental has provided me with best service and experience every time and every appointment. Dr Collins is very skilled and excellent dentist.

This is bit expensive compared to other dentists but it is worth every penny. My whole family (4 people) go there and we never had any issues with the dental care. We have had crowns, cleaning, bridges, tooth pulling for my son.<//review>

I have insurance but they don't take what I have, that being said, I pay out of pocket to specifically go here.   I have had everything from an implant to whitening trays done there and I would never go anywhere else. Patient service is above par, caring doctors and a comfortable relaxing environment.  They have thought of everything to make you feel "at home" while you have to be here.  This place is amazing.  They also have an in house insurance plan that really helps out.   Amazing A+.</Review>

Smile Quest Dental is the real deal! Friendly and knowledgeable staff, great doctors, and great facility. Wendy was fantastic and made my first visit very enjoyable. Both she and Dr. Starr took their time to answer all of my questions and concerns, and they made me feel right at home. I highly recommend them and you won't be disappointed!
Also, if you're looking for a great hygienist ask for Korbi! She did an awesome job and is super friendly too.<//review>

I absolutely love Smile Quest Dental! I get all my teeth cleaning done here and I just finished up my Invisalign with them! Everyone there is extremely friendly and welcoming, particularly my orthodontist Dr. Collins. I highly recommend him. They make the whole process easy and even fun. I just love how the whole office is friendly, quiet, well decorated and clean. The staff is also great with advice on how to keep my dental hygiene at its peak and after following their rules I haven't had any cavities in years. They are also extremely attentive to your needs and making sure you're as comfortable as possible. I highly recommend them.</Text>

Incredible! My first visit.
From the moment I entered the practice I felt like a friend! Christina greeted me with a warm SMILE and a gracious nature.
Amanda did a complete and thorough job of debriefing me on my condition and reason for a visit ( a cleaning). She was friendly and professional.
Dr. Lapierie had a great bedside manner his approach was very caring and attentive.
I was expecting the practice (as other dentist have done) to attempt to suggest treatment that was not really necessary and to bombard me with marginally necessary procedures. THEY DID NOT.
I would highly recommend this dental practice to anyone.
My wife also went that day and had a similar experience.
In fact my daughter and he two toddlers go to SMILE.< /text>

This place is amazing. Everyone is smart funny and friendly. You can't help but to smile. They have a waiting room with a couple massage chairs and a room for children to keep them busy during your appointment. I recently had an appointment and a doctor looked after my son on his break while I was getting a root canal done. How awesome is that!! I am still getting work done but they make it worth every moment. I can't wait until its all complete. I recommend smile quest dental because they really go out there way to help you have a great smile. Thanks smile quest</Review>

The staff are exceptional at working with you on anxiety since a lot of people generally don't like going to the dentist, they are very accommodating and considerate of time as well as scheduling. Love the people and love the work that was done, the dentists are very gentle and kind. Had no trouble what so ever! Definitely giving friends and family a recommendation for smile quest dental!<//Review>

Smile Quest reviewed another dental office recommendation for work (February 10, 2017). Their second opinion confirmed recommendation without adding any additional work. Friendly staff and they agreed to match the other dental office's prices. Scheduled the work to be completed at Smile Quest!

On March 3rd Dr. Starr and Krissy were awesome as they extracted a wisdom tooth. Much easier procedure than when two other wisdom teeth were extracted almost 40 years ago.

Definitely recommend Smile Quest for your dental work!

My husband has been going there for more than two years now and he just loves it so much. The staff are very friendly and nice. When you walk in through the door they greet you with a smile. Never been much for the dentist but we went ahead and got his teeth checked out and we immediately were able to get him started on invisiline. There prices aren't that bad either. His teeth look amazing now thanks to Smile Quest. Now we have the whole family going there.</text>

Smilequest Dental is Awesome.  They use an ultrasound machine to remove most of the plaque, so very little teeth cleaning needs to be done with a metal scraper.  It is virtually painless.

And they have their own Dental Plan at a Very Low Annual Cost. This plan the last couple years was $179 and it included two Dental Cleanings a year and full x-rays every two years.   And the Staff is very Nice too.</text>

This is my first post military dentist and I could not be happier with the work they did and more importantly the way I was treated. My wife is been using Smile Quest for a few years and would always brag about getting cookies after each visit. That's just the  Cherry on top. World class service and you will leave feeling like you didn't just have a fast one pull on you. You get to see the before and after pictures of the dental work you have done. They  explain what they are doing and make you feel so relaxed by having a tv in the ceiling for you to watch while you get work done.

Dr. Collins, you are the man!

I would highly recommend anyone who is looking for a new dentist to check them out. You will not be disappointed.

They are also amazing with kids!<//review>

<Text>INCREDIBLE!!! Yes a trip to the dentist that was truly "INCREDIBLE" & almost unbelievable. Dr. Collins and Marla were nothing short of amazing during my last visit to Smile Quest Dental. I went in for a Wisdom tooth extraction, I had been nervous about this procedure all day right up until my 4:00 O'clock appointment.  I was also feeling a tad bit "crabby" because I really didn't want to be there. Marla prepped me for my extraction, Dr. Collins came in to administer a numbing agent. I felt zero pain during the numbing shot, Dr. Collins then proceeded to pull the tooth out with what seemed like total ease . I felt zero, no pain, no pressure, no nothing and just like that "it was over" ( thank God & Dr. Collins ...lol )!!! Dr. Collins literally remove the Wisdom tooth in roughly 30 seconds or less. I experienced zero ...ZERO pain, I was elated!!! This procedure was performed on Thursday, I anticipated that evening would not be so kind and easy as the extraction. To my surprise and delight  I experienced zero post procedure swelling of my face or gum area, zero jaw pain that evening, none on Thursday, Friday or Saturday. Today is Sunday, smooth sailing ahead for me thanks to Marla & Dr.Collins. If you ever need a tooth extracted with zero pain at an extremely reasonable price these folks are top ranked professionals in my book. In addition to this work Dr. Collins had previously replaced a broken crown for me, it was just as smooth and painless as this most recent visit. The folks at Smile Quest treated me like family, THANK YOU TO Dr. Collins, Marla and the entire staff at Smile Quest Dental, Best, Frank Simmons< /Text>< pics>

As good as dentistry gets!  I had 4 experts working on the 5 phases of putting 3 white fillings in one tooth without any pain during or after the job was done.  Some offices would have put on a crown which I did not need and which would have cost 3 times as much. Great service with real professionals using the latest technology.  After 10 years of my family getting our dental work done at Smilequest, we would not consider going anywhere else.< /Review>

Hi All,
Both Frank and I had great service at Smile Quest, as always.  We look forward to December when we will be seeing all of you for Christmas, (our next appointment). We were particularly happy to see Dr Starr.

Best wishes to all for a wonderful summer.

Cheers,

Frank and Ann Joule< /review>

My first visit with Dr. Smurthwaite, Whitney and Tricia was awesome!  The office is very high-tech and super clean and organized.  The staff is very friendly and kind.  They have all the dental services needed in house so you don't have to struggle visiting different specialists for different things.  I loved that!<//text>

No matter how friendly a dentist is, or how filled their office is with massage chairs, cookies, etc., for me the most important thing is, Can I trust this dentist?  And Dr. Smurthwaite instills absolute confidence when I come to see him.  I know he's completely honest about what the x-rays say, something I have found not to be the case with some other dentists.  I know he will not recommend excessive work or unnecessary procedures.  This peace of mind is everything to me, when it comes to my health-- and my wallet!  Yes, this is a super friendly office.  And yes, I do like those cookies.  But the best part is the integrity I know I can count on.< /review>

Everyone is friendly.   I felt like the hygienist did a fabulous job and I liked that she made suggestions on how to improve my cleaning abilities.  Loved the warm wax hand treatment while I got my teeth cleaned.</Text>

I have had many visits to several different dentist in my lifetime, none of which were all that Pleasant. Not only did I receive substandard care, but never with any real bedside manner.  However, when my dear friend, also an employee, recommended that I go-to Smile Quest I was a little hesitant. I was proved very wrong. This is by far the best dental experience I have ever had! Talk about personal care, Efficiency, wonderful staff, thorough team . All my questions were answered. I felt relaxed, as did my children and husband in the  a spa like waiting room. They made going to the dentist nothing short of a anxiety free experience. No longer a chore! You feel like they are happy to provide you with care​, something that never happens at conventional dental offices, who make you feel rushed or plain like you are a burden. Mostly because the staff is happy, they enjoy what they do, they respect one another. I listened intently as fellow employees spoke with one another with encouragement and dignity and patience. I  left feeling excited about spending money, feeling confident that they will deliver what they promised. Looking forward to having a healthy smile for years thanks to all at Smile Quest. I can't wait to get all my needs met. Again, what a wonderful experience.... A must . Worth looking​into. Thanks again!< /review>

Everyone is always super nice. You get to watch TV and have headphones while they are working on your teeth. Even though I only had teeth cleaning this time it was pleasant as a dentist appt. could be. They offer free cookies on the way out.</text>

They are VERY informative so you know every single step you will be taking throughout the process. I have never loved being at a dentist office until I came here. Holly was amazing and very personable when she was asking for information. Dr. Smurthwaite was PHENOMENAL! He was caring, genuine, fun and great. I have never had such a great experience with any doctor. He is awesome. I actually can't wait to go back and see the team.<//review>< pictures>

This place is pretty expensive in my experience but the staff are great and the quality of their work is worth every penny. Get this, I told the dentist that I wouldn’t be able to have access to a dentist for 3 months unless it was weekends, unfortunately this office is closed on weekends but the dentist offered to come in on a weekend if I needed work done! If service like that hasn’t hooked you already then idk what else would. Free cookies and snacks in the lobby?< /Text>

Normally a great dentist and partially my fault for not geting it done sooner but, had a crown put in knowing no one was going to be in July 4th if something happened. Tooth still hurt. Called July 5th, turns out all Doctors are on vacation... Sorry but it doesn't take an expert to see that kind of scheduleing mistake. Stuck for the weekend with a throbbing tooth after a level 10 pain incident.<//Review>

It has been a real pleasure and very easy. I have many  dental and denture work done before and never has it been this easy and pleasant. I was fitted for my wax temporaries today. I have never had my dentures fit so well. They were always too big, falling out of my mouth. But the lab did such a wonderful job on them I have nothing but good to sAy about smile quest and the lab. I actually look forward to my visits. Thanks guys!!< /Review>

The best staff, quality care and atmosphere. I have been here for a few years now and have done invisalign, fillings, whitening and cleanings. There is a great room for kids to play in, complimentary paraffin hand wax and fresh baked cookies everyday. I see Dr. Star and Hygienist Holly. I highly recommend them!< /text>

Dr. Smurthwaite is the best dentist I’ve ever had. Not only is he a pain free and competent dentist but he is personable, caring, and compassionate.
I recommend him to everyone.
Especially love that crowns are mulled on site so no temporary crowns. Yay!!

I would never see any other dentist!!<//text>

It's ironic that the name is called "Smile" Quest because they have totally taken my best feature away from me. I no longer feel comfortable smiling as I was given a front tooth that is twice the size of the original and looks very much as if I was given a giant Chiclet instead of a tooth, and was told after I brought up the size that it would blend in with time and my gums could be cut to make my other teeth look larger. Needless to say I have not returned to have my gums "cut" and it has NOT blended in with time. And the final insult is I paid $4000 for this and will be paying for it for the next 6 years :(< /Review></record>

Comfort & care during visits makes being there pleasant. I so enjoy the professionalism & friendliness I receive from Holly for my cleanings, she comunicates clearly with the team for treatment needed and even gave me anesthetic with ease prior to Dr. Collins tx.  Amanda was a constant source of comfort as Dr. Collins assistant during a recent procedure. I've never had any post discomfort which is REALLY new with my dental history.

Dr. Collins and every person at Smile Quest that I deal with are extremely good at their jobs and always in a caring manner.  I'm thankful for my new implant, root canal, and cleanings.   I don't think it could be done any better.
Thank you Smile Quest and Dr. Jonathan Collins.< /review>

< Review>
I've been nervous to find a new office after my last few experiences with a previous dentist. I just had my first appointment with Smile Quest yesterday and can already confidently say, they truly go above & beyond to make their patients feel at ease. They're attentive every step of the way, from the moment you walk in the office- to the very end! Dr. Smurthwaite is a wonderful dentist. He is knowledgable and will explain his recommendations thoroughly , but he also takes time to listen. I also appreciated that he's kind, compassionate and quite personable! Yes, I gathered all of this just from my first visit!! If you are looking for a dental office that is on top of their A game but also professionals you can trust, I sincerely recommend Smile Quest =>    -Angel<//Review>

This is the best dental office in the world.  Dr. Smurthwaite is the  most amazing dentist I have ever gone to and believe me, I have seen a lot of them. My former dentist wanted to pull several teeth, but Dr. Smurthwaite fixed me up without pulling anything and my smile is now beautiful !  He is better than any dentist in Hollywood and his work is amazing.  He has a payment plan that I can live with and an office that is sooo efficient.  I will never go to another dentist, this man should be called the best dentist in America !<//review>

<Text>I have been to a number of dentists in my lifetime - but I have to say that this office, staff and my dentist, Jaime LaPierre, are by far the friendliest and most accommodating people I have ever encountered in the dental field!  Every procedure  I need was fully explained to me, and every question or concern that I had was always answered with a compassionate and thorough response. This office has very experienced and empathetic employees that definitely put my mind and anxiety at ease....Dr. LaPierre even sang a tune during my procedure when my phone's Pandora turned off! Every step of the way their focus was on my comfort and  they tried their best to make sure I was pain free. That speaks volumes to this dental phobia woman! I am finally getting the dental work done that I have needed for years because of the caring and capable staff in this office.</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Ive had quite a bit of dental work over the years; root canals, tori removed, chipped molars. Ive had a deep rooted fear of dentists for years...Until now.  No bleeding after a cleaning or a wet face.  Incredibly Gentle!  They were a 2nd opinion, and saved me thousands of dollars the other guy was going to charge me, for work i didnt need done.
I Love my dentist and all of the staff.</review>

<text>If I could give this office a "10" star, I would !!  I have been going to Dr. Smurthwaite for many years now and would NEVER consider going anywhere else.  It is impossible to say enough positive things about him or his entire staff.  They are all so pleasant, personable, positive, professional and extremely caring. You rarely find anyone without a smile on their face.  All my life I was afraid of dentists.  I would always expect pain and I was rarely happy with the results.  This was not the results that I found at Smile Quest.  Finding Dr. Smurthwaite was an absolute blessing!!  He not only changed my life, but improved my self esteem.  Wow!!  Who would have ever thought that I would actually look forward to seeing my dentist?   :-)< /text>< GmapID>

<review>This is THE place to go to for your dental problems.  I went to several dental offices that were good but when I walked into Smile Quest Dental I was amazed at the state of the art  dental  facility and  technology that was available. I was looking for a second opinion on a dental problem.   Dr. Smurthwaite examined  my teeth and was able to provide treatment alternatives. Needless to say I immediately signed up with Dr. Smurthwaite. A kinder and more intelligent dentist is hard to find.</review>< Rate>

There is hardly ever a wait time at Smile Quest. Once I check in it usually take minutes for someone to tend to me. The staff has always been extremely nice and very informative. The doctors are amazing and never try and up-sale any treatments or procedures. They are the most humble group of dentist I've had the pleasure of knowing. I went into Smile Quest to achieve an long life goal of mine. TO FIX MY TEETH. I went in with very low hope. I thought that nothing could be done. I had very bad gums, missing teeth, extremely crooked teeth, and bad decay.

One year later Ive had laser gum work done, regular cleaning, Invisalign treatment and Im at the homestretch of my dental implants. You could never guess my mouth looked as bad as it did by looking at my smile now. I am so pleased with this process I know have the whole family at this office.

I highly recommend Smile Quest Dental to everyone. Whether its simple work or major work needed. This office will satisfy all your dental needs.

EXTRA INFO - You get friendly reminder via Text, Mail, E-Mail and Phone call of upcoming appointments which is very convenient to me. There appointment availability are always nice. I've been to dentist that had appointments months out for simple cleanings. Not Smile Quest Dental They take care of you as soon as possible.<//review><userid>105096724765871086452< /userid><gmapID>0x809b2224de6ed7a3:0xdc5feb33d295ba50<//gmapID>< Name>

Well so I needed to wait a bit for implant. But let's look at the possibilities. My awesome dentist caught the issue, corrected  it and now I'm awaiting that that smile I'm missing.  Thank you Dr. SMURTHWRIGHT.

<text>I came all the way from Atlanta, Georgia to have Dr. Smurthwaite fix my front tooth. Crazy?! We were going to be back in California anyway, and he is the best dentist my husband and I have ever seen. My husband is a professional speaker/trainer. His smile looks better at 50 than it ever has in his life. My tooth--the chip I was conscientious about now looks perfect. I asked my husband how it looked and after he stared for a few seconds he asked, "Which tooth was it?" When he finished, Dr. Smurthwaite said, "That will last you the rest of your life." I came from Atlanta, paid out of network prices (which still weren't bad), and I couldn't be happier. We love this place!<//text>< pictures>

<Text>Yesterday I went in for a crown replacement which meant that I would have to endure a very uncomfortable and painful injection in my jaw. I have always dreaded this shot. I know it's necessary for the procedure but it hurts and has always left my jaw aching for at least a day or two afterward. So as I was laying in the chair with my mouth wide open steadying myself for the inevitable pain, I felt nothing. I looked to see what the hold up was and Dr. Collins was nearly finished. I couldn't believe it! And it gets even better! When the anesthetic wore off I experienced NO jaw pain!!! It was a Christmas Miracle:). He is the gentlest Dentist I have ever experienced!  Dr. Collins dental assistant, Krissy  was wonderful. She talked
me through the whole procedure and made me very comfortable - even offering me a blanket. She and Dr. Collins seem to work seamlessly together and you can feel the mutual respect comradery  they have for each other. I still can't get over how wonderful this "dental" experience was. Thanks Dr. Collins and Kriss!</Text>< Pics>

Staff is super friendly ...must be the free snacks & cookies they provide,  ha!  I did have a problem with one of my tooth and because they stand behind their work, Melissa Alcala made it happen!  She listened attentively & expressed empathy to my complaint!  She also made sure I left with a new appointment to fix my problem tooth, free of charge!  That's why Melissa stands out on excellent service, preventive damage and problem solving!  Thank you Dr Smurthwaite & Melissa for my peace of mind!<//Review>

So shines a good dental office in a weary world.
Dr.Smurthwaite and his staff are wonderful. He understand dentist jibberish. (Brownie points for that) He is charismatic and humorous and thoughtful. Even called to check in on me after a lengthy procedure earlier in the day. No complaints here 👌🏻☺️👏🏻 After all my dental trauma as a child and young adult I finally feel freed from the enslavenent to those traumatic memories. Sometimes in life there are no words to truly convey ones feelings adequately. Lastly tho not least,  shout out to Amanda who assisted, what a compassionate, sweet soul. #bravo #nicelyplayed</Review>

I was amazed at the level of professionalism everyone displayed. Being a natural skeptic, I was shocked at how caring the staff was. I'm still looking for what can be wrong with this place.</Text>

< review>
I can now say I'm a person who USE to HATE the dentist but now I have found much love and comfort in Smile Quest and in particular DDS Gina Salatino.  I had my teeth cleaned yesterday and the treatment went like this: my rings were cleaned while I received a paraffin wax hand dip which followed by listening/watching Ellen with headphones/ big flat screen while sitting in a massage chair. Oh and did I mention I got my teeth cleaned too.  Once I was done I freshened up with a mango towel wrap and then I collected my 5 year old who was being more than entertained in the "kids" room and the snacks they provided him with.  Thank you Dr. Salatino for one making me like the dentist for the first time in my life and for fixing my teeth!!!<//review>

<review>I can not say enough good things about the staff and Dr Smurthwaite at Smile Quest Dental.
First off, as pain free as you can get going to the dentist. 1st dentist that I was numb after the shots as compared to in the past were it would be 2or 3 rounds of shots just so it was numb enough.

State of the art facility, and they delivered exactly what was promised to me. Because I deal with the public every day I had been apprehensive to start the work, afraid I would have missing teeth while waiting fot the work to be completed.  That was simply not the case, went in had prep work done and walked out with temporary bridge that in its self looked great.

I highly recommend Smile Quest Dental to any one needing a dentist.</review>< userid>

<Date>1488572822583<//Date><Rate>5</Rate><text>Was impressed with the first visit, the tour of their clean office including a Childs room, massage chairs room and paraffin hand bath.  The first exam was the most complete and thorough exam I have ever had at a dentist office.  I like the way they say what can be done to improve your mouth and smile, but ultimately it is your choice what you want to get done.  They consulted on procedures and what my insurance covered and what I was responsible to pay.  No hidden costs here.  The X-ray staff to Dr. LaPierre were very kind and thoughtful.  My next visit was for the teeth cleaning from another very kind and thoughtful hygienist, Stefanie.  The cleaning was one the the best I've received!  I've already told my family members how wonderful they are and recommend they change and come to this dentist office.  I hope they do!  March 3rd, Just finished 2 days at the dentist office to complete the work that was needed.  Not only did they complete the work, but I actually felt like Dr. LaPierre was not only very concerned that he improve the function of my bite but that he cosmetically fixed my teeth to look better than they ever have in the past.  I once again am proud and happy to smile!  The dental assistant was kind and caring also, I can't thank the whole team enough!<//text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<Review>Bad experience at this Dentist and doing the whitening special. They've had me come back 3 times to get whitening trays and each time they say will have to do new impression.  I asked what the issue is and they do not know and couldn't even find the first bottom impression.  What are you doing with them Smile Quest??  Where is bottom tray??  The last technician which her name tag said lead, she said she will work on them and give me call when ready or if any issues.  Never got a call and showed up today to pick up trays and did not offer a reason on why they need to do the third one after second one and can't even find the 1st impression.

My wife and I have spent thousands there with them since she is doing Invisalign and you would think I would get better service than this.<//Review>< pictures>

< Review>
I am a disabled Veteran with severe anxiety. I've always been ashamed of the way my teeth looked and never showed them while smiling or anything else for that matter. I talked with Dr Smurthwaite he thought  that a few  Porcelian Veneers would fix the way I felt about my smile. He was right I have never felt more confident in my life. My theeth are now straight and they look great. Smile Quest Dental is the  Best.<//Review>

< Review>
Staff from the receptionist to the doctor was fantastic. They're all very friendly and get to know you being very cautious and careful of how to treat you. Xray is done easilt with you putting your chin on a machine and it goes around you thoroughly for the full xray. I met with Amanda who first gave me a tour and did the initial xray and questioning before meeting Dr. Lapierre. Had my teeth cleaned beautifully by Holly enjoying a nice, warm and smooth hand lotion wax wash. I will definitely go again!< /Review>

<Text>I am about 2/3 of the way through my amazing Invisalign adventure.  The staff at Smile Quest Dental are truely top drawer when it comes to my dental care.  I have very high expectations of my dental care providers and when I retired to Lincoln from the Bay Area 2 years ago I did extensive research on the practices near me.  Smile Quest Dental ticked all the boxes and I was very impressed with my first visit.  Their in house plan for those without any dental insurance (like me) is wonderful.  When I decided to finally get my crooked teeth straightened (you're never too old to improve yourself 😄), I felt very confident in putting myself in their care.  Invisalign is the easiest dental process I could imagine and I am very happy with my progress to date.<//Text><response>None</response>< Name>

<review>How many people can honestly say that they feel excited at the idea of going to their dentists? not that much ,and I won't blame you because like you, I used to be terrified just at the sound of the word dentist. Then I met Smile Quest Dental (SQD) or, I should say SQD found me, and my family, and from that moment, out teeth find a place they can call home. It would be important for me before moving forward to precise that, unlike many real people of our generation who are smart enough to do Facebook, twitter, I'm just a mom but also a healthcare provider  and to that end, I can fiercely say that I know what to look for when I'm going to a dentist. I want to feel as at home I want a Dentist who will be providing me with a care that is customized to my needs,  and income, I want to feel special, appreciated, and welcomed. more importantly I want my dentist to be able to follow all the rules and regulations of infection control,  sedation, and safety. At SQD, I have found all that and so much more. At SQD, from the receptionist, to the Hygienist, and Dentists. you feel special, they all know how to make you feel comfortable, you do not have to wait forever to get an appointment, and once you get there, there is no delay on your care, and their work ethic, is amazing. I also need to mention that not only they have the state- of-the art equipment, but also they have a children room, tasty snacks, bottles water, massage chairs, and giant TV screen , with multiple channels.  For all that I will greatly recommend SQD to anyone. and to SQD I will say keep up with the great work.<//review></record>

<gmap_id>0x809b2224de6ed7a3:0xdc5feb33d295ba50<//gmap_id><Text>From my very first visit to SmileQuest.. upon meeting Dr. Smurthweight & team there.. they've ALL made me feel so comfortable & welcome. I knew instantly upon meeting Dr. Smurthweight that he was a very kind & compassionate man! It didn't take long for me to also come to the conclusion that he would be the doctor who I would choose to do my procedure!

This procedure I was going to be getting (got) is a very complicated.. lengthy one & fairly new within the past 10ish years as well. So when choosing exactly the right fit for who I felt would do the best job "&" I'd also feel the most comfortable with throughout this lengthy process.. I knew wasn't going to be an easy task!! Until I met Dr. Smurthweight!

After interviewing quite a few different dentists.. I stopped upon stepping into SmileQuest.

Now I have to let u know that I'm not the.. "anything u say doctor".. kinda girl! I'm very opinionated.. outspoken.. I do my research.. I come in knowing what I want (with a small margin of wiggle room) & I make sure my voice is heard (even when I can't talk:) ). That's not to say I'm the nightmare patient. I'd like to think quite the opposite on mostly:) almost all days. I'd like to think the doctor would rather know their patients true opinion.. not having a mute unhappy person..?!

But Dr. Smurthweight & his staff were all definitely up for my challenge! Even though it took me at least 6 or 7 visits before I'd even sign on the dotted line. Yet they still ALL treated me then.. the exact same way as they ALL treat me to this very day! Like they just saw a really good friend walk in & they're all so excited to see me! Each & every time I walk in their door! & by every single person who works there too!!

Dr Smurthweight took extra time to explain exactly what the procedures were & in detail (in terms I understood).. as I was looking at a couple different types of procedures to get the same result.He actually does that any time I have any questions or concerns about anything! He's even come in after hours & stayed late bcuz I was having some trouble with something & he stayed until he fixed it!

He gives u his personal cellphone # so u can reach him in an emergency! Reach "him" not an operator! He "personally" calls u the day after invasive procedures to make sure ur okay & u understand everything u need to know!

His staff is ALWAYS kind and helpful. They're like having your own cheerleading squad.. sent there to make you feel like a new person every time u walk out of their office!

Within the past.. almost 3 years now that I've been with Dr. Smurthweight at SmileQuest he has done very extensive.. invasive work in my mouth. It's a lengthy process for s reason! & he's doing a beautifully!

I couldn't be happier with my decision to go with Dr. Smurthweight & his team at SmileQuest Dental! I'd recommend them to everyone!</Text><user_id>112728307141653099205<//user_id>< pictures>

Smile Quest is a great Dental Office.  My husband purchased a generous coupon at a fundraising auction for Invisalign (teeth straightening aligners).  My brother-in-law was our dentist and would accept our insurance as full payment.  However, Smile Quest was more conveniently located for the frequent dental appointments that would be needed for Invisalign. The service my husband received over the year was so fabulous that we transferred our care, including our 4 children, to Dr. Smurthwaite.  When my daughter's orthodontist could not be reached, he cared for her on a Sunday evening to treat her infection caused by her braces.  Smilequest has not only been wonderful for regular cleanings, but also for root canals, teeth extractions, and sedation. It is not uncommon for Dr. Smurthwaite to call after treatment "just to see how the patient is feeling" after major dental care.
I have never missed an appointment because Smile Quest accommodates our need to change appointments and my children love visiting the office.  The playroom and massage chairs add an inviting touch to the practice. The front staff is friendly and truly provides "excellent service." When errors on computer generated statement have occured or we had questions with our insurance, the office has always settled these issues promptly and professionally.  They are WONDERFUL!</text>

(Translated by Google) It is an honor for me to be part of this beautiful family. I say Family because this is how they made me feel (like home) Their Professionalism their Ethics their Respect and Human quality made me lose my fear! It is not easy to feel this way especially when we are far from our Earth. My respect and thanks

(Original)

No es fácil sentirse así especialmente cuando estamos lejos de nuestra Tierra . Mi respeto y gracias< /text>

The place is immaculate and they did an A+ job on my car. They dealt with the insurance compnay of the guy who hit me and my whole car was detailed when I picked it up. Great guys, ARTHUR is a no brainer.</Text>

<review>Arthur at Formula Automotive has always taken great care of me and my cars. He is the first call I make whenever something goes wrong - whether it be an oil change, body work or something more complicated. He is honest, fair priced and communicative. I stopped taking my car to the dealership for service - only Formula Automotive.</review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80c2c0fea0e95e89:0x278020587c0d7393< /GmapID></record>

They have repaired several of our vehicles over the years, and, in each case did an excellent job at a cost far below the insurance company's estimate.</Review>

I am so extremely happy with my entire experience from beginning to end. The customer service is impeccable! My vehicle was in very dangerous condition and they made sure that I left there with the safest vehicle possible. They accomodated my schedule as well. I was able to drop my vehicle off the evening before and it was ready before my work day ended the next day. I would refer anyone to have their vehicles worked on here. Quality work and amazing communication.< /review>

<review>Quality body work, professional and courteous staff, quick service, very reasonable prices, and 24 hour availability. This place definitely deserves five stars. While they were working on one part of the vehicle, they included some small repairs on another part of the vehicle as courtesy. Next time if I ever need any work done on my car again, I would certainly return to this garage.j< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Great place with honest service and fair prices. I went here after getting ripped off and overcharged by another car repair place, and FORMULA AUTOMOTIVE GROUP made me feel like my car was in great hands and I didn't worry about being overcharged here, as they explained every detail of the bill. This will be where I take my car from now on.</text>

I've been taking my car here for several years.  Arthur, the general manager, is awesome.  The prices are fair, the and the work done is excellent.  I'm invited to view the parts that need replacement and invited again to see them before they are discarded.  I replaced nearly every moving part in my 1998 Maxima and never trusted by car at a dealership.  I highly recommended Formula Automotive Group in Glendale and look forward to bring my new C-Max here for service in the future.<//Text>

Formula Automotive is absolutely the best! Arthur and his crew are very knowledgeable, and do outstanding repairs and maintenance, including diagnosing and solving challenging problems, and doing top-quality work on everything they do. I bought a used Mercedes which turned out to have some perplexing problems, and they solved them all. As if that weren't enough, Arthur is the nicest guy in town, one of the most trustworthy person in the business, always a pleasure to work with, always fair, and always comes through. Bringing my car to Formula has absolutely been the best experience that I've ever had with any car service, and no one else is even a close their service. He is so good in every way that, even though I live outside the area, anytime my car needs something, Trust your car with their team!</Review>

<text>Arthur and his team are spot on. I've been bringing my cars here for five years. Before that I floated between automotive service shops, never finding one I cared to return to for one reason or other. Arthur always explains issues clearly, including what needs to be done right away and what can wait. I am also given options for replacement parts. Everyone is friendly and attentive. It's a block from the Americana on Brand if you want to hang out there to wait for your car. The coffee could be better, but really, that’s as close I  come to having a complaint. And if I cared enough I’d hike over to Peet’s in the Galleria. 0.2 miles away according to Yelp.</text>< pictures>

<Review>Still the best place to get your vehicle serviced. Friendly, knowledgeable, ethical staff that will keep you going. Also, forget the warehouse stores for tires - these guys know what's best for your needs.< /Review><response>None</response>< date>

They sat down and talked me through the whole process of getting a tow when my car wasn't working.  The turnaround when I got it in was quick and it was affordable - will definitely be returning in the future.</Text>

This shop is the only place I take my vehicles when they have issues. I have never trusted a shop and manager more than I trust Arthur and Formula Automotive Group. I've saved thousands vs the dealership over the last 2 years.<//text>

They kept saying that they would replace it and never did. They installed a stereo system for me as well. They wired it wrong and I had to pay $300 to have someone else fix it. I tried calling them on many occasions and Danny just gave me the run around. He said that he would make it right and never did. I gave them ample times to correct the situation. Then when they wired my speakers they never adjusted my amp. Lost the plate on one amp and lost two screws from the other amp. Put in a blown new speaker and when I went back to have it installed I left and none of my windows would work. Please NEVER GO THERE.  They are very unprofessional and will not correct their mistakes. Now I have to go to court to hold them accountable.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

Danny was most courteous, prompt and accommodating to install a cell signal amplifier system in my Roadtrek RV. I appreciate his recommendation to add a switch (no extra charge). His technician Marcel installed everything properly per installation manual. I noticed a problem with the signal amplifier only with external electrical hookup. When I returned this morning Marcel immediately diagnosed and repaired the problem which was due to some faulty wiring originally with the vehicle. Both Danny and Marcel do an excellent job listening to the customer's preferences for the installation and explaining how it all works. All works perfectly now. I highly recommend Soundsations for any of your auto installation needs!< /review>

< Review>
SPEACHLESS!!!! Purchased a head unit from Danny a few weeks ago and SCHEDUED it's installation for FIRST THING this morning.. First one to the shop and while I'm checking in, 4 other installations/ customers show up. All I'm having done is a head unit installed (I RAN ALL OF THE WIRING MYSELF/ BEFORE TAKING THE TRUCK TO THEIR SHOP) and a cleaning up of the wiring for the EXISTING alarm. Getting a little concerned after not hearing from the shop after 8 HOURS, I give them a call only to be told that they're going to need to keep the truck until SOMETIME Monday....No can do as I'm leaving tomorrow for a cross country trip.... Get to the shop within 10 minutes to discover that NO ONE HAD EVEN SO MUCH AS TOUCHED MY TRUCK!!!!!! Had it for 9 hours and didn't do one single thing.... I arrived to find the owner (Danny) under my dash, frantically trying to make it look like something got done.. NOT to mention, the alarm system which worked when I dropped the truck off, now doesn't. Oh, and ALL 4 vehicles that checked in after me were either gone or being actively picked up...</Review>

They came up with a way to install a Sirius device into my Tesla 3 which most companies had no idea of how to do it.  And the two other companies that gave me an estimate they were about a $100 less than one and $300 less than the other.  In addition the owner of the company was very helpful and came up with a better installation and was still looking to improve the reception.<//Text>

<Rate>5</Rate><Response>None< /Response><Review>You can tell within a few moments how much Danny loves what he does. When I first went into his shop after going to a few others around town. I could see his passion. The system he did sounds great. Yesterday I had a small issue with one speaker but I brought it in and he fixed everything. This shop is great, he stands by his work and fixed my issue. I couldn't be happier with his work.
For reference I wanted everything to appear stock but to have new speakers and sub. He tried a few options and we went with Alpine everything.

<Text>After weeks of researching what I though would be a simple solution to a car audio issue, I was no closer to finding a fix than when I started. I reached out to every car audio business in town and wasn’t getting anywhere until I was referred of Danny at Soundsations. With Danny’s more than 30 years in the business, and with his wide breadth of knowledge, he very quickly solved the problem that no other sound professional in SCV could. He and one of his guys, Ruben, are truly masters of their trade. All work was done sooner than promised, install was clean and custom, and I was treated like a valued customer from beginning to end. I was never rushed or up-sold, and Danny only carries the best, newest, and most reputable brands and products in the business. Absolutely no cutting corners there. Two thumbs up to the only people I’ll be taking any of my cars to for custom car audio!</Text>< gmap_id>

< Review>
Danny went above and beyond to get my CB radio installed on my truck for my overland trip on such short notice. Soundsations is a community staple and I'm forever grateful for their knowledge, service, and attention to detail. They're a great team and should be the go-to for anything car/boat audio and stereo in the Santa Clarita Valley. Thanks again for everything!< /Review>

Great crew, long history.  Does not come in cheap. I had a great sound system installed here with Danny and the crew.  I was having trouble with my door speakers and kept taking it back. But finally,  the end results was more than I could have imagined.< /text>

<name>Anthony Nardizzi</name><resp>None<//resp><Text>Before I came here I went to Auto Sound on Railroad and they completely screwed up my 2018 Jeep Wrangler.They went into my wiring harness and bent a plug. The alarm never worked correctly. It would go off all the time even when I was driving. I had them remove the alarm (which they refused to refund, we will see in court) brought it back to Jeep and paid to have it fixed. Gave it to Soundsation and they put in alarm, 4 camera recording set up and it all work perfectly. Very professional fair price and great work. Go in and ask for Danny.<//Text><Time>1549548419042< /Time>< rating>

I purchased an alpine 4 channel amplifier and Danny forgot and put a renegade 2 channel. I showed him the receipt and he started yelling at me and said I made a fake one. After he checked he realized he was wrong. I'm going to take my loses and not go back because he is just going to mess up my car.< /review>

The manufacturer agreed that there was a problem and replaced it with a second defective unit.

<review>Sign said store opened @ 9 am on Saturday...sat in parking lot until 9:15 and no one showed up.  Called the store and no voicemail or recording...ended up doing a google search for Benjamin Moore paint and found Vista Paint on Soledad Cyn Rd @ Reuther.  Vista had great customer service and were a real pleasure to work with.  Newhall Paint has lost a customer & Vista gained one!</review>< gmap_id>

I have been considering moving to ta newer system for my Mercedes for some time, Danny and his team provided a personal touch and in depth explanations of the Pro's and Con's of each unit.

Danny set a reasonable expectation of delivery and called when the he encounter a problem that resulted in ordering a special part.  Danny got the part in and delivered the car the next morning.

Lots of installers do their best; however, it's how a problem is resolved that matters!  After discovering a problem Danny jump right in and fixed the issue right away.  Downloading new firmware from the manufacturer.  That's what sets Danny apart from others.  When there's a problem he makes sure it's resolved.

Thank you Soundstations!</Text>

The nails look incredible, I can’t believe my real nails look so good. The pedicure also turned out amazing. I will be going back, great prices too.

Just added another photo from my newest visit. A+++++

Ps.

Have been back many times since initial review and the ladies always treat me kind and do a super job 🥰< /Text>< user_id>

<Text>Wonderful salon full of Vietnamese women with excellent work ethic! The place was immaculate and careful attention was paid to sanitation and cleanliness. Got both a manicure and a pedicure in record time – my nails look fabulous! Very friendly to walk-ins. I would highly recommend this salon!<//Text>< resp>

3 out of the 4 times I went here in the last couple months, despite the fact I had an appointment, they have left me sitting with acetone on my gel nails in excess of 30 minutes to accommodate walk ins.  This is not the worst.  Saw one of the women massaging her feet with open sores and bandages and to proceed to work on a new customer without as much as washing her hands.  The back of the salon is covered with filthy towels on the floor.  The Health Department needs to shut this place down.  I am a Registered Nurse and I assure you this place is disgusting.< /Review>

The whole process is very relaxing and you feel like you are in good hands. Everything is clean; the leg massage with hot stones is awesome; the get are properly scrubbed; the nails are looking good. It was especially nice not to feel rushed: my pedicure got finished only a few minutes before closing time; yet i was given plenty of time to make sure that the nail polish would be dry enough for me to put my boots on.< /review>

Came here as a walk-in earlier today and am thrilled with my nails. She has an eye for detail and did an amazing job cleaning up my cuticles and reshaping my nails. She helped me pick a color that I love, too.
I'll definitely return to this nail salon. It's well worth it!<//Text>

I had such a great experience here. I showed my stylist a photo from Pinterest. This chick got it down. I love my nails! It's so awesome here so friendly kind and just as stoked as you are. We had great conversation and she was fast and if she wasn't who cares because my nails are awesome. Thank you Sutter Nails. I'm coming back and telling the world.< /Text>

I walked in and asked if they could do an eyebrow wax, the lady immediately had me go into the room and lay down. She did an awesome job and I was out in less than 10 minutes. The place was clean and everyone was so nice. Next time I'm in town I'm definitely coming back.!!!< /review>

<Text>I LOVE this place! This is the only place where I get my nails done. All of the nail techs are great! I've been going here at least once a month for the past 2 years and I'm always blown away at how great my nails turn out! It's extremely sanitary and the experience is great! They're always super busy so I would recommend making an appointment, even though walk ins are available. The seating is limited for waiting so you may end up standing while you wait, but other than that, this is my absolute favorite nail salon ever!< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

I only go here because my gels last the longest. Sometimes busy, but do their best to get everyone seen quickly. Very friendly! Amazing service. Don’t forget to ask for a punch card! You’ll get a $30 gift card after 10 visits.< /review>

Visiting SF, randomly called and had a lovely pedicure experience. Clean, caring, and efficient. I did not have open toe shoes and they gave me flip flops without me asking. Appreciate it.</review>

Went in for a pedicure with my fiancé. They were more focused on going as fast as possible to get to the next customer than actually caring about quality with us. My pedicure was maybe 10 minutes, if that. My fiancé’s nails weren’t trimmed and nails weren’t painted all the way (weird, I know). We came here because of the positive reviews, but we will never come back here again. Waste of $25/pedicure.< /review>

I’m a visitor to San Francisco and I was staying at the Grand Hyatt hotel. I needed a quick mani pedi and hopped right into this nail salon. I absolutely enjoyed the speed and kindness of all the workers! Thank you for the speedy yet quality work!<//text>

The only bad part is they pressure you to pay cash. I totally get it since bank transactions are pretty expensive. They have an ATM inside the business. You're not required to pay cash but it's recommend.

They have a very nice clean public bathroom!</review>< Pics>

Good prices, but I had to wait forever, the people were so rude, the person who did my gel was only nice when I gave her a tip! I should have not even given her that nice of a tip. Also she cut my cuticles horribly. But i guess you get what you pay for here.< /review>

They gave me a PERFECT set of acrylic nails (even I couldn’t believe how natural and perfect they were)
They asked me about every aspect of how I wanted my nails and did according to every word I said
If you are thinking of getting any beauty procedures (mani pedi waxing) look no further !!

<Review>Why pay for an expensive manicure when it just comes off the same day? I came in on April 23rd and got a manicure with gel polish with my mom. I leave around 12:30pm and by 5:00pm the GEL polish on my thumb on my right hand started peeling off. Now I know how you’re supposed to apply GEL polish, because I’ve gotten my nails done multiple times. Just not my favorite salon. Definitely not coming here again...  ALSO, THEY DO NOT TAKE CARD...</Review>< Gmap_id>

Went in for a mani pedi and eyebrow waxing. I could have done a better job at home. My nails weren’t painted all the way (which sounds weird even saying) the pedi was just quickly done and my nails weren’t painted all the way as well. Eyebrow waxing, I had to point out some very obvious spots that needed to be plucked after she was done. Needles to say I’ll be looking for another nail Solon.< /text>< Pictures>

My daughter and I got gel manis. Great prices and the finished mani was good quality. But... They were rough when filing our nails pre-gel application. My daughter had 2 cuticles bleed and my nails are so thin now after removing the gel. It's going to take weeks for new, healthy nails to grow in. I'm not sure why they were so rough on us!<//Review>

<review>Worst Mani Pedi ever! After filing my nails they didn't remove the residue under the nails. The application was bubbly and unprecise. On my request to improve those flaws she proceded to file my nails again and damaged the polish of some nails. After that she just added another coat of color and topcoat, which just was too thick to dry properly.< /review>< user_name>

So good! I was visiting SF and popped in for a quick mani and pedi. The mani in particular was perfect, 8 days on and not a chip. Opi not gel! I'd be a regular if I lived there.< /review>

Terrible nail job - the layers of paint were unevenly applied. The staff is friendly and they're fine for waxing.< /Review>

As an out of towner it is always nice to find places that provide exceptional services. Sutter Nails did not disappoint. I walked in earlier than my appt and they gladly served me. I had a regular mani, pedi and eyebrow waxing. All the ladies were exceptional and the price was very reasonable. The place was very clean and nice atmosphere to relax after a long day of shopping. The next time I'm in San Fran I will definitely visit them again!!!!<//Text>

<Text>My vehicle was badly damaged on Hwy 80. My insurance carrier asked where I would like to take my vehicle for repair. I knew I wanted Klimisch as they had proven to me on a previous visit to do exceptional work. They did not let me down. The communication, time management and actual work performed restoring my vehicle to normal was the best. The staff are professional but friendly. I received my car in 2 days the inconvenience was short lived.<//Text>< Pics>

Beware this Once was a reputable shop that got AAA preferred body shop award, but with their current body staff look how much care was put into my car. The following cold morning I noticed condensation, why found cracks and chips where it should be all black in both headlights. In addition both fog lights have cracks as well. Also the front bumper drivers side was sagging. They not only declined to repair what they obviously destroyed also declined service to my other car that was awaiting parts arrival. AAA states their isn’t a problem to have it repaired.< /Review>

K does a great job. Got body job done after minor damage from Stop sign runner.  Easy location to get in & out of. Easy n Quik  to 'admit ' auto for treatment.  Talked with mechanic B4 doing work. Nice guy,  Car ready when promised & no sign of previous damage.  Good job. Even saved the twinkly heart stickers my granddaughter put on, ( so Grandma can find her car in a parking lot. )  They are back on now!  Every one there helpful & efficient.  Definitely recommend this business.<//review>

Just picked up my Chevy Bolt after collision repair at Klimisch’s and honestly this is THE place to go to get work done. So fast, and they did a great job on fixing the car.  But I think the most important thing that made the experience at Klimisch’s top notch is the level of service from Devaughn Harris! He was better than 5⭐️.  He was so helpful and did an exceptional job of staying in touch and keeping us informed...I never had to call to find out what was going on w/ the car because he kept us informed and checked in along the way!  Thanks Devaughn!!!!</Text>

I was help by Bruce Hubert. Bruce gave me an estimate,  told me exactly how long it would take, sent everything to the insurance company and scheduled the work.  They took me to the car rental place. I got text messages every day giving me the progress. They ordered an aftermarket bumper,  but upon receipt of  was not satisfied with it. Bruce text me and told me of the situation and let me know that they would be ordering a new one from BMW and it would take an additional day. I got my car back fully detailed inside and out. So I would recommend Klimisch's to everyone I know.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

In this age of virtual almost everything, it was so refreshing to experience what felt like hospitality!

It’s never fun or enjoyable to have to take your vehicle to a body shop.  Klimisch’s Inc. took care of everything for me!! They interfaced seamlessly with my insurance companies estimators, securing the rental car for me, and even drove me to the rental car place after dropping my car off to them.  I was kept informed as to the progress of my repair.

When I went to pick up my car it was beautiful! I have to admit it looked even better than Before my accident!  I picked up my car and left my rental at Klimisch’s. It was so nice not to have to deal with the rental return!!!

Fabulous experience!! I highly recommend Klimisch’s Inc.!! I have given them 10 stars if that were an option!!!< /text>

Very professional staff..good quality work.Good when you pay with car insurance but pricy if it is from your own pocket but still a good job.Just first ask for an estimate..it doesn't hurt to find out how much it will cost you. .If you find it helpful, PLEASE get me a like 👍<//text>

<text>It used to be a good place.  I don't know what happened.  My car needed hood repair on an insurance claim and I chose Klimisch because my husband said he got excellent service there in the past.  Before I brought it in, of course a guy does a walk around, an inspection, turns everything on and off, etc so everything worked fine.  After having replaced the hood and keeping my car for 3 days, I was happy.  Until  suddenly on a long, scenic, road trip,  the water from the windshield wipers didn't want to spurt out.  I was like, "Good thing they guarantee their work for up to a year".  Boy, was I wrong.  Rachel told me that they won't repair it "because my car is too old".  Get this, I just bought my car, pre-certified.</text>< GmapID>

<review>My car was rear ended. It incurred bumper damage. They replaced my rear bumper & painted it. My vehicle was low on oil, they added oil as a courtesy. They washed & vacuumed my interior also. Great customer service. Nice people👍<//review>< Pictures>

What a 5 Star experience! Friendly, courteous and professional from start to finish.  They took care of everything for me, from the estimate to the outstanding work on my new Focus. They do all of the paperwork for you and get you checked in and checked out VERY quickly.  So refreshing to walk away feeling really great about taking my car there.  The end results were over the top.  They don't just fix your car--they wash and detail it before turning it back over to you.  Promised a 5 day job and got my car back a day early.  Klimisch's is awesome!!<//Review>

Klimisch's  was high on my auto insurance list for repairing a smashed bumper.  The body shop scheduled us conveniently and completed their work to perfection.  In addition to excellent service, they had the car cleaned inside and out, and worked well with Enterprise to provide a rental car. Thank you to everyone at Klimisch's.< /review>

Klimisch’s corrrected a problem for us that another shop had been unable to find and correct. They do top quality work and communicate with you through out the process. We highly recommend using Klimisch for your auto body repair.<//Review>

<Review>They did a fantastic job on my 2016 Challenger, the staff was nice, and they came in  under their first quote! They even gave the car a great cleaning after, I will certainly bring my vehicles there and I suggest you do too!</Review>< user_id>

Poor quality of work, Poor customer service. Do not take your car here, especially if it is a dark color. If you have them attempt to correct the problem, they will only make it worse. Find a different shop!<//text>

<Text>Yes,  friendly staff however,  mediocre level of quality!   Took my 2016 GMC Sierra for a front bumper/grill refinish, AAA insurance claim black in color.  Quality of workmanship and detail IS NOT there.  Visible  traces of sandpaper lines, over the finished product.   Missed to cover several rock chips.   There was certainly orange peel left in the bumper and grill area and the clear coat was not even and neither was the finish. Took it back for a second time and improvement was visible,  but still not up to par.  Black color is NOT their  forte!< /Text>< pictures>

<text>Needed 2 bolts tack welded on a control arm. Easy stuff....20 bucks max job in and out. Called and a woman answering told me I'd need to plunk down $90 bucks just to have them "assess" it. Called American Canyon Collision Center and they'd look at it for nothin'. Pay attention: How you treat your customer at first meeting, determines if you keep that customer at all. To the rest of you out there....Anytime they start trying to highball you before even meeting you, that's an indicator they will be screwing you in and out the door. Beware these guys.....seem greedy from the git go.</text>< pictures>

A year ago Klimisch made unbelievably perfect repairs on my Lexus which was rear ended and pushed into a truck so that the front was also badly damaged. In addition the work was done quickly and the I was kept well advised by telephone about schedule and progress. Klimisch provides the kind of professional and respectful service that has now disappeared from a lot of our society,
Today, when I went back to the parking lot after a visit to my physical therapist I found that the back bumper wrap around had been pulled away from the body of the car. I brought it to Klimisch for a quick estimate before deciding whether or not I should invoke insurance. It was immediately looked at and concluded that repair could be made on the spot. It took about 20 min which should have invoked a charge of about $30 at the going labor rate. I was surprisingly informed that the service was complimentary and to remember Klimisch the next time I need repairs.
This is the kind of "old fashioned" by today' standards that we are all missing dreadfully.
Thank you Klimisch< /text>

There are many reasons to people love the IV Food Co-op. Of the frequently mentioned are its quality goods (including local, seasonal produce and fresh, in-house Deli items), reasonable prices, knowledgeable Workers, cooperatively owned and operated history (dedicated to bettering the community for 47 years), and free reuseable masks and thermometers to help ease the burdens of the Covid Pandemic.<//Text>

This is my go to grocery store. The produce is amazing fresh and lasts long. They also carry small packaged items that are great for day trips or toddlers. We also get some of their bulk fig bars and musli. It is one of the few places you can get good oat milk. The prices are extremely comparable to other grocery stores,
I have checked!

The only downside is that their meat selection is limited, pricey, and usually not worth the buy. I can get organic meat elsewhere. Also, while they have a great selection of natural bathroom products I always can't find exactly what I'm looking for at the right price.

I go there more than once a week. My child loves going there too!< /review>

<pics>None</pics><Response>{'time': 1608752373046, 'text': "Hi Fabio,  Thank you for this reflection.  We are a community-owned grocer.  It's hard to compete on all prices, particularly now that Whole Foods is Amazon owned.  They are pricing down because they have a volume of sales that we can't come close to.   Our pricing is supported by 150 other food co-ops in the country, and we offer bi-weekly sales and about 300 items on Co+op Basics pricing (full list on our website).   Hopefully you're able to use our sales and basics the next time you're shopping to see how affordable we are!  Plus your money stays more local when you shop co-op.  Happy Holiday!"}<//Response><GmapID>0x80e93f682e6b6e7f:0xff76885f3b5e10ee<//GmapID></record>

Well stocked little co-op. Lots of organic veggies, coffees, cheeses, bacon, tofu, etc and a fairly large bulk selection. They even have house hold cleaning supplies. Pretty much everything you would need from a health food store, but it's even better... It's a co-op!<//Text>

<name>Philip Brown< /name><Pictures>None</Pictures><Text>I buy all my coffee here, since they regularly have high-quality free trade stuff on sale for $7-9 per pound. Can't beat that! You have to watch out for their pricing in general, because non-sale items are typically super expensive - easily on par with Whole Foods. On the other hand, using their sales, owner/member discounts, and coupons, you can walk out witg some great deals and know you're helping support a cool little neighborhood gem.< /Text><userid>104998219232871435546< /userid>< Rate>

Shop here if you want to live.  Cancer is prevalent, and linked strongly to the trash in today's food supply.  The staff is slow turnover, thankfully, and often remember my name or face.  Despite the large population of international students in the area, they manage to keep prices relatively low.  I cannot find some of the products they sell here anywhere but Amazon.  Think Global, Shop Local, Hooah!  Follow Me, to the best patio in town, with free Wi-Fi.</review>

Small food coop in islavista sources quality food, books, teashirts, gifts has great prepaired food section and bulk section. I reccomend visiting, it has been a staple in the community much like the food bin and herb room in Santa Cruz.</Review>

The turn-around time to receive our product from the time the order began to when it was completed was incredibly fast. Our school really appreciated having our banners ready within such a short time frame. thank you Fast Signs and Francisco!< /Text>< pictures>

< review>
We ordered our backdrop banner for our largest tradeshow with fast signs. I was a bit nervous at first I needed the signs to be top quality and was on a very short deadline, but the results exceeded my expectations. The customer services , quality, finishing details, turnaaround was outstanding. When I realized that the banner where barely fitting in my delivery van they offered to make me a custom storage tube so I can transport the banner safeley. I defnitely will place all of our company orders with them from now on.<//review>

Chad, Edgar and Patrick at the FASTSIGNS store in San Rafael are knowledgeable, professional and kept me updated through the entire process of planning and installing two large signs for my new e-bike store, New Old School E-Bikes in Sausalito. Scott installed one interior and one exterior sign. He was very friendly, patient and professional, doing a superior job. I couldn't be happier Scott! I originally planned to hang the signs myself, as they were made by an outside company, but I soon realized it was a job for the pros like FASTSIGNS. I was pleasantly surprised when Chad said they were willing to help. Thank you for the great job - from my initial phone call to the completion of the job. Hey, I even received a partial refund! How often does this happen? I appreciate your integrity and will be in touch very soon for COVID-19 signage. Thanks again guys, Vince Weigel, Owner.< /text>

FASTSIGNS San Rafael is a top-notch sign company.  They are quick to respond to your online submissions, both friendly and prompt with their delivery times and there talented creative individuals.  I've had the pleasure of working with not one but 3 staff members over the last month for a big project and they have all been AWESOME!  A big shout out to Chad, Nathan & Francisco for helping me out with a company wide transition on signage.  I look forward to doing business with them for years to come.< /Text>

<Date>1520621699244<//Date><rate>1</rate><text>Disappointed. Read a lot of great things about this business online and I was very excited to start a partnership between this business and my business. Sadly every time I called except for the one where I cancelled my order, I was met with very rude resistance as if I was wasting their time. It was an extremely uncomfortable and unpleasant experience trying to order the sign that I had in my head for my event. If you’re someone who likes to take their time with their financial decisions, stay far away from this place. They will hustle you over the phone, and act like you’re inconveniencing them, rather than being accommodating and helpful in the process. And to add insult to injury, very overpriced compared to online services with the same turnover speed.

They quoted me $1,200 for two door magnets for a car and offered same day service, telling me I could have everything done that afternoon. So I went back to my office feeling confident. Only to call them and be told a completely different story a week later. They say I have to pay a “rush charge” all of a sudden, and now it’s $2400 for two door magnets. No thanks.

VistaPrint is charging me $207.81 out the door for two magnets of the same size and quality, and nobody is there to make me uncomfortable or rip me off, done deal.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

<text>The service was excellent and I got the sign I wanted for a price I could afford. Ryan made sure he understood exactly what I had in mind. Fast Signs gave me the best quote but, as were all the other sign company's estimates, it was still higher than I expected. Ryan worked with me to bring the price down to an amount I could afford without compromising the look I wanted. I will definitely go straight to Fast Signs for all future signage.<//text><Name>Maggie Champagne</Name><resp>None< /resp><Date>1429148763102<//Date></record>

Great customer service. Brandon is a gem. Give him a raise! He is very patient, knowledgable and courteous.
The print quality of my photos onto magnets is better than at high end photos labs that I've used.
As a professional photographer and filmmaker, I am very particular with how my shots are printed. I would recommend FASTSIGNS highly.

<review>When there was an issue with our vinyl lettering, Matt quickly reprinted a correction at no charge. Then when another issue arose at the time of install, the installer notified me, went back to the shop, corrected lettering, returned and installed. He was knowledgeable, fast, and offered wonderful customer service. Thank you!<//review><time>1441384071535</time>< Response>

FastSigns was fast, efficient & affordable. One of their staff, Brandon, went the extra mile to help us fix a low resolution logo so we could get our order finished on time. Thank you Brandon and FastSigns!</Text>

Operating a  small sales & marketing company requires a lot of "many hats" on one head to get things done. I needed some sinage for a Trade Show on very short... Next Day... notice.   I stopped by FASTSIGNS and Francisco provided a proof the same day and the finished banner in less than 24 hours, start to finish. There's a tempo you sense when you walk in, and a lot of activity that suggest this is a 5 Star business.  Their performance proves it. I highly recommend you patronize FASTSIGNS!

<text>FastSigns was very helpful. I'm a professional digital design consultant and I needed a special sign that would stand up to sun and heat.  I uploaded a large file to them for a 42"x84" sign on corregated plastic which was painless and quick. They printed the sign quickly and delivered it. Colors are true and vibrant.  The sign looks great! On Time and On Budget and all on the internet and phone. Customer service was outstanding. I will definitely use them again.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x8085978a9aae1305:0x1f12f4db217fd59b<//gmap_id></record>

It was fast ,  professional and well done. Some slight scheduling issues but it was resolved quickly and efficiently. We are PRANDI Property Management and the van has already brought us customers.  The work on the van looks great and we get many compliments on how professional it looks.  We call it the PRANDI Van!

<text>I brought my car in to have the door replaced after having my car vandalized (multiple times, might I add) in San Francisco. I could have had the repair done in San Francisco but I drove down here because of the great reviews I saw. Aaron worked with me to give me a quote, assisted me through the process with insurance, and quickly let me schedule a repair for my car. He was extremely flexible in scheduling and was communicative during the entire process.

With regards to the actual repair, the quality was fantastic. Just look at the picture. Can you tell my driver door was replaced? Me neither. And that's what a good repair should be. The craftsmanship, paint work, and attention to detail was great. JP went out of their way to make the car look perfect even when they didn't have to. I am a happy customer and to the extent that I ever need to get body work done again (fingers crossed!) I will drive down to JP Auto. The level of quality in repair is unmatched!< /text><Resp>{'time': 1610454766294, 'text': 'Thank you so much for your kind words, Karthik.

<Review>The team here does great work.  Unfortunate for me, I've had the need for body shops more than I would like, and I wish I've started with them sooner.  Other places I went to always left me arguing with the work done.  These guys will fix your car as if your car and treat it as if it was your first born. My car got fixed and you won't even know it had to get fixed. If you are reading this and doubt still have doubts.  I'm someone who owns a black vehicle and am sensitive to swirl marks let alone major repairs that don't match. These guys made the repairs at a master class level and didn't add a single scratch to the vehicle. This might sound common, but it really isn't. They put others body shops to shame.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>The doors on my car were keyed in SF and needed to be repainted. I saw reviews about JP auto body online before going there. The reviews looked too good to be true and I thought they couldn't live up to all the great things I was reading.
Having had my repair at JP I can say they are amazing and they exceeded my expectations. They are very slick in terms of customer service, they worked with the insurance company so I didn't need to, they arranged for Enterprise to pick me up for my rental without delay (thank you Aaron!). Importantly the quality of the work is exceptional. They matched the color of the doors perfectly and I can't even tell there has been a repair.
Would definitely use again if I need to.< /Review>< Date>

I was knocked off the 101 by a run away driver, not injured but the driver side of my BMW X1 was practically ripped off. The car was towed to JP Autobody and the amazing Aaron took on our case.

Aaron was the epitome of professional, extremely high customer service. He explained the process of assessing the damage to the car, gave us an estimated time line and potential costs. Once the work was completed he invited us back to talk us through all the works. The car looked like it had come directly from a showroom! The estimated costs were bang on and we left as VERY HAPPY customers.

We’d highly recommend JP Autobody. I should also say that every member of the JP team we interacted with also delivered the exceptional customer service that is clearly being driven by the management. Really great experience!</Text>

<user_name>Henry Dea<//user_name><Review>Extremely professional. They performed amazing work. I had body damage on my Tesla Model 3 at a few locations (a mix of my fault and others faults) and JP Auto Body Shop was able to repair it. I dealt with Peter and Ray. Peter did the initial assessment and notes, while Ray kept me updated. Peter memorized and performed everything we discussed (there were several items). Ray kept me informed towards when my car was ready and was able to pick out details to make sure everything was repaired properly. The body shop handled everything that had to do with the rental and insurance. There was no hassle on my part at all.</Review>< user>

< Review>
I had a great experience working with JP Auto Body in repairing my BMW X1.  I typically park my car in a garage, but left it out one night over the holiday season and it got bumped from behind while parked which required me to get repaired.  I contacted my local BMW dealer to get a list of their preferred vendors, and JP Auto was at the top of their list.  They referred me to Ray and I was able to get in touch with him immediately - he offered to give me a preliminary estimate at the SF BMW Dealer (which I took him up on).  After meeting with him and getting a sense of the work, he walked me through the process of working through my insurance... luckily JP is an approved body shop through my insurance, Geico, which made the process extremely smooth.

A couple days later I dropped the car off, and it took about a week to get finished.  When I went to pick it up, the car was sparkling clean, bumper repaired, and it felt like new!  I would highly recommend JP Auto for your auto body repair needs!</Review>

< Review>
10/10!! Had work done on my X2 after someone backed into my vehicle. John helped us and was courteous and professional and kept us informed. They did an amazing job repairing the damage and returned my car spotless. If I ever need body work done in the Bay Area JP Auto Body will definitely be where I take my car!!</Review>

Ray and the JP Auto Body team are top notch! Coming in I had a lot of worries and reservations.

I have a 2021 BMW that was severely scratched down to the metal. Not only did Ray take the time to breakdown expectations in regards to my service concerns. He also provided me with solid advice on how to prevent future issues, plus words to rethink how I thought about the situation overall.

Within 5 days, Ray’s team was able to repaint my vehicle and release it back to me in time for the holiday. Ray ensured I was provided a rental vehicle and handled most of the paperwork/communications. I luckily got a 2021 Dodge Challenger with 30 miles on it! I was able to swiftly drop it back of at JP Auto and have them return. On arrival, my car was vacuumed and detailed even tho it was already clean.

10/10. High recommend!!</Review>

Luckily no one was hurt. I had placed my car under the care of JP auto which was recommended to me by my brother who had some experience with them. Almost right away i knew i made the right choice, they were helpful esp (peter) he was professional and gave me updates every step of the way also answered all my concerns. When it was ready and i picked it up i was amazed on how it looked. It looked like a brand new car.. i will definitely do business with them again.< /Review>< pictures>

<Review>I had a huge dent in my door. I showed up they were very fast professional and accommodating. I showed up and was greeting by a guy who had my information and rental car ready. It was super fast in and out. They assured me my car was in good had and sent frequent follow up text and calls about the status about my vehicle. When I picked up my car looked brand new is was polished and detailed and again I was in and out super-fast. Ray handled my car and was great at communicating. I will go back to Ray and JP auto-shop for my future car needs.
Great work team,

<Name>Eric H<//Name><Pics>None< /Pics><Text>Not even 2 days after making the last payment on my car,  I got hit/scratch front to back on the passenger side. My insurance recommended JP Auto Body Shop. Aaron is hands down the most professional, and courteous around. He called me the day of the accident, and told me no to worry, bring in the car, and they’ll handle the rest.

He personally took care on dealing with the insurance company to get my car repaired properly! He make sure to quote everything in a way it will be approved plus avoiding the short cuts the insurance cost try to force you to take which will result in a sub-par repair.

My car was returned looking good as new as the day i bought it. The exterior was flawless, and interior skillfully detailed. Please thanks your staff for me for a job well done! 5 stars<//Text>< userid>

<text>I got hit and run and totally destroyed my two left doors.

I found this shop by accident, but as it turns out they are BMW's first choice in the bay.

I worked with Ray for my BMW X5. Exceptional service! Understood how my insurance worked and was always ahead of the curve in terms of insurance paperwork, parts procurement and keeping my car repair on schedule.

Got my car back and it looks great. Paint matching was perfect, new doors work great, and it looks like no accident ever happened.

Highly recommend!<//text><response>{'time': 1605552493678, 'text': 'Thank you so much for your kind words, Adika. We really appreciate you taking the time out to share your experience with us.\n\nCheers,\n\nJP Auto Body Shop'}< /response>< Rating>

< Review>
I came to JP Auto Body after an unfortunate collision with a deer. I did not have comprehensive for my 99 Corolla and needless to say, was feeling concerned and vulnerable.  JP Auto Body listened, answered my questions and gave me the confidence I needed to go forward.  Their follow up to my call / email was awesome, and every question was answered. The value for the work performed was above and beyond - as was their service.  They directed me to a low cost rental car while my car was in the shop, had the car ready a day ahead of time and even remembered it was my birthday when I picked it up. Best decision ever. My Toyota looks the best it has in years, and the body work / paint application is flawless. 100% recommend, no need to shop around. JP Auto Body is exceptional, with great people who care.<//Review>

JP Auto Body helped with a repair estimate for my insurance company after being in an accident. The vehicle ended up being a total loss, but John was extremely helpful, friendly, honest, and communicative throughout the entire process. I heard from John daily with updates as they received my vehicle, started inspections, completed the estimate, provided me the estimate breakdown, and helped me clean out my belongings. They did an extremely through breakdown of the vehicle piece by piece to make sure everything was captured. I was extremely impressed with how much care and attention I was given, even though they weren't actually going to end up working on the car and making any money. I have no doubt their quality of work would match their increible customer service, shop organization, and very knowledgeable staff. Highly recommend!!</text>

I had a major dent in my BMW due to an accident and this was my first time getting body-repair done/filing an insurance claim. JP Autobody was fantastic to work with and did an amazing job walking me through the process and explaining in detail the work needed for repairs with OEM parts. I got daily updates on my repairs as well as prompt responses to questions and got my car back looking brand-new with free of charge detailing done. Highly highly recommend for any body repairs!</review>

Excellent, I would recommend them to anyone. My wife's car was side-swipped and there was extensive damage. Aaron, the manager, went over everything that was going to be repaired then gave me a written estimate. Aaron stayed in contact with me via text for the next 3 weeks and and updated me on the progress. When I picked the car up the repairs were immaculate and they even sanitized the inside of the vehicle. They saved me a lot of time and headache which made the process seemless. I even returned my rental car to them instead of Enterprise. Thank JP.< /Text>

My insurance company sent me to JP Auto Body Shop. What a great experience! Totally customer service oriented. Car was done in the estimated time with text messages throughout with updates. Staff made sure you were taken care of. When I picked it up it was washed in and out and filled with a full tank of gas. Shout-out to John J who took care of me when I dropped off the car and remembered me when I picked it up. John made sure to offer hand sanitizer after any exchange with him. Thanks JP auto shop! You're going to be my go to body shop.< /review>

< Review>
I got into a car accident last week and I was rear ended (thankfully no one was hurt.) The insurance company of the individual at fault gave me a list of auto body shops to choose from to get my car fixed. I was hesitant to take my car to any of the shops UNTIL I came across JP Auto Body Shop. Who could resist with all the amazing reviews?! I went ahead and called to schedule an appointment. Making an appointment was so easy and I was connected to Aaron who handles insurance claims and he was able to schedule me a date and time that worked with my schedule ( which is a huge plus for me.) I was scheduled to come in on Monday and when I arrived Juliano helped me right away! I didn't even wait more than two minutes, I parked my car and he quickly came. He helped me get my rental, I was suppose to travel to the other side of town to pick up my car. But he told me not to worry because someone would come to the shop to get me! I mean WOW that was truly helpful on my part.

I took my car in on Monday and picked up my car on Thursday (the same week.) Aaron called me and gave me frequent updates, which I highly appreciated because I am the type of person who needs to know. He went though everything with me and let me know that I was in good hands.

Once I got the call to get my car from the shop Aaron told me " just bring in your rental and will take care of the rest." I truly appreciated that!

My car looks amazing! I got my car cleaned from the inside and out! WOAH the extra cleaning they had to do. I was beyond impressed.

I will definitely come back to this shop in the future. I definitely recommend this shop!

Everyone is so friendly, kind, and very professional< /Review>

My car was involved in an accident and my insurance listed JP Auto Body Shop as one of the options. A quick google search showed this was a great option and they did not disappoint one bit.

Aaron was spectacular in every way. The best part of the high quality service was the stellar communication. Aaron called and discussed each step of the repair process in a transparent and clear manner. At the end, my car was fixed on time and honestly looked better than when it was new. I couldn't recommend Aaron and his team more.

If you will need to rent a car, they also referenced the San Bruno Ave Enterprise which provided a shop rate rental price.<//Text>

<review>We bought 2019 X3 as for my wife driving to work. Unfortunately, the incident happened just few days after we had the car. At first we thought about paying it from our pocket to prevent the insurance premium going up. So we looked for a reliable auto shop  and we found JP Auto Body Shop with the immaculate review.
With help from Peter, he advised us to initiate the claim with AAA even though JP is not in the AAA list; Turn out the price of fixing is not small. And from that point Peter had thoroughly taken care of, including a rental car providing at site.
After waiting for the part, our car was ready within 3 days. It looked so brand new since Peter gave our car a complimentary touch up and detail. My wife is very happy. We would strongly recommend JP Auto Body Shop to anyone, especially BMW owners. it is absolutely better value, very cost effective and JP Auto is also a BMW Certified Auto Shop. I saw many BMWs having services in there.</review>< Pics>

Top-notch service. Used JP Auto Body to repair my car after an accident. They handled everything end-to-end, including insurance claim and reimbursement. Didn't have to do anything other than bring my car and pick it up once fixed. The repair was done perfectly.<//review>

<text>Thanks John for all the hard work! Geico wildly underestimated the damage on my girlfriend's car, John and his team took the time to thoroughly go over the repair costs and provide us with a detailed invoice for the repair. The car ended up being a total loss, but I would totally trust these guys with the job if going the repair route had made sense. Very professional, friendly and the shop looked awesome!</text>< Response>

Aaron at JP Auto Body was very professional and straightforward with explanations for repair.  Drop off car on a Monday (9/28) and got the car back by the following Tuesday (10/06). Through out the week I was constantly getting updates via text messages. They gave me a call when they were done. The car was flawless and they did a complete detail interior and exterior. My car looks like it’s brand new. I’m very happy with the work JP Auto team has done.<//Review><pics>None</pics>< response>

< Review>
My car was street parked and a roofing operation accidentally covered my car front to back with a glue substance that required my car to be re-painted. JP Auto did an excellent job and my car looks better than I've ever seen it (since I bought it with 40k miles on it). I'd recommend them to anyone, but especially if you own a BMW since they're the official body shop of the SF BMW dealership.<//Review>

The back of my Subaru was mangled after an accident (trunk, bumper, undercarriage bent and warped) and I brought it in to JP on a recommendation. SO glad I came here! The entire staff was professional in handling the financial end of things, and my car actually came out of their shop looking better than when I bought it.<//review>

<Text>My Tesla model Y was recently rear ended and needed to get repair. I've called JP Autobody to schedule an appointment and had worked with Ray who specialzed in Tesla and BMW, provided a lot on what kind of damage they look for or make the inspections and sending that information to the insurance group.

Jp autobody also provided me a car rental while my car was being repaired. It may have taken about a month to repair but they were able to provide me with an weekly update and told me a status on where they were or what they may be waiting for. It was very professional of Ray to continue to provide me these updates.

On the day of pickup, the car looks very good and doesn't even look like it was ever in an accident. I would highly recommend JP Autobody when needing your car repair. The paint job was even better than what the original Tesla was. I would like to thank JP Autobody again for the great job.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>{'time': 1614064523982, 'text': 'Thank you so much for your kind words, Tom.

<review>My car was recently broken into and I went on yelp to find an Auto Body Shop and JP ABS was one of the first to respond to me. Aaron helped me out tremendously, starting from giving me advice on what I should do next regarding the break in. The repairs took a little while due to my passenger side mirror being limited in stock. But they took care of everything, as well as smooth out my car’s scratches. They also thoroughly vacuumed my carpeting and made my car look a d smell brand new. All for a reasonable price. Highly recommended.< /review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

Excellent service and great work. They held my car for a few extra days to make it convenient for me to pick up. Also, they hold on to all the replaced parts until after pickup, which was great as I was able to recover my parking sticker. I will certainly be coming back for all my body shop work< /text>

Everybody I interacted with, from Aaron to Peter to Julian, these men have been professional, friendly, and so thorough with their work. I trusted their judgement and the level of care they provided has been incredibly easy and smooth, even with my rental car pick up and drop off process. They even coordinated with the local Toyota to get my maintenance done. Thank you so much for an incredible experience! My car is looking really good, much better than before the car wreck.< /text>

Was recommended by a friend to go to JP to fix my car, with a bad scratch and a loose bumper... I brought my car in in the morning for an inspection, but had to leave for work before it could get repaired. Peter was really nice, and he actually put a tape to temporarily attach the bumper before I drove off to ensure my safety. I dropped off the car later in the afternoon. Repair was fast, and at a very reasonable price. He suggested the most cost efficient way to fix my car, which is particularly important for a person like me, who knows nothing about cars. So in summary: excellent service!< /review>

This past week was my first time taking my vehicle to them and I'm throughly impressed by the level of care and detail they gave my vehicle, their friendliness and professionalism and ability to deliver timely.

My car was hit, and I had to get it repaired. Johnny at JPs was so nice, so professional and direct. The garage kept me informed constantly, including that a part came in damaged and had to be delayed by a couple of days. I never wondered what was happening.

<Review>I couldn't say enough good things about Aaron at JP Auto Body Shop.  After having my car hit by an Amazon truck and bringing my car in for repairs at the request of the insurance company, he handled everything for me.  I showed up.  He gave me a rental (Hertz).  He told me not to worry.  He was right.  About a week and a half later, car was ready as scheduled.  Came back to pick up my car and dropped off the rental.  Easy!  My Jeep looks brand new and I couldn't be happier!  Aaron was professional, helpful and explained everything.  I was in good hands.  Thanks again Aaron!</Review>< name>

<Review>Very good service. Second time I’ve had to take my car in for minor work. Guys are quite attentive and walk you through each step before and after the repairs are done. Text updates during the repair are helpful as well. No need to call in frequently to figure out when things will be complete. Fair pricing relative to other shops. Estimate was lower but quality of work was just as good. I guess other shops have to bump up the prices due to all of the marketing they do. Suspect these guys can keep prices more reasonable due to the word of mouth referrals and good reviews that they get.</Review>< pictures>

<Review>Awesome shop. Honest people. Really easy to work with. All positive vibes. The man I worked with was John. He knew right away what the Geico estimator would agree to and what would be fixed. The car looks amazing and the service was on
Point. Got text message updates.

Got the car back at the date estimated. Awesome. Thanks!  Would recommend this shop to anyone.< /Review><user>106611698171240171041< /user>< GmapID>

JP Auto Body was referred to me because of their flawless work and luckily, Aaron is there to assist. He is very accommodating and accurate about the process as well as rental car service. Although, I didn’t receive the notification update through my phone, he went out his way to keep me updated. Thanks for taking care of my car Aaron and JP Team! 😊</review>

Aaron made the process very easy and stress free. He took his time, explained each step very well for me to know what to expect and have an understanding. The process took a little bit longer than I expected (2weeks) but, it was worth it. Got my car back looking better than when I dropped it off! Original parts and work was done great👍<//Review>

<text>I've never had the quality of service that I experienced at JP Auto Body.  I checked Yelp reviews and this place by far outranked all the others. As soon as I stepped foot on the property,  I was sold. My experience here was so great from start to finish, I plan to become a loyal customer. I am very particular when it comes to my property and getting high quality service. If you want TOP customer service,  someone that keeps you updated with the status of your repairs at each phase, your car fixed perfectly and efficiently, this is the place to go for your auto body needs! I guarantee you won't get this level of customer service and quality anywhere else! They have rental cars available and a wonderful team working with them as well! Would highly recommend this place! Aaron is 100% client focused. I felt like I was a high level important person getting specially care. They take care of all the paper work for you. Juliano went the extra mile and put some touch up paint on two door dings for me (not in any way related to the body work I was having done) and wouldn't charge me for it and wouldn't accept my tip. YOU GOTTA CHECK THEM OUT!!</text>< pictures>

Exceptional service from start to finish! I met with Aaron Kesler, who understood that I wanted to pay for repairs out-of-pocket. He tailored my quote to help me try and save as much as possible on the cost, never once pushing anything superfluous. He also understood that I needed to get my car back as soon as possible, and was able to get it in same day and even return it a day earlier than was scheduled. In addition, JP Auto Body has a great relationship with the Enterprise rental car in San Bruno. They were able to get me a great daily rate there for a decent rental, had me driven over to their site for pickup, and returned my rental for me after I picked up my car. If you're looking for an auto body repair shop in the bay area that truly values customer satisfaction and does great work, I highly recommend them.< /review>

Someone hit my car and ran away and GEICO set me up w JP auto body and they were the best auto body shop I ever worked with. John helped me out w all me questions and he did a great job fixing my car. Later on when I had another problem and came to see him, he was still willing to help me. He even took a test drive w me and tried to figured out what was wrong. Before I left, someone told me that my brake light was out then they changed it for me for free! They r the BEST</Review>

After putting off addressing my scuffed up bumper and fender for a year, I'm glad I chose JP Auto for the repairs. Ray was my point of contact and I felt communication was very clear and concise. The rental car process was very smooth (they were able to drop off my rental for me), plus it was reassuring to receive daily text updates on my repair status. They did a great job with great attention to detail-- even touched up the paint on my side mirror when they noticed a small scuff mark. I highly recommend them for autobody repairs!</text>

I just picked up my Subaru and I'm very satisfied with the process using JP Auto Body. He not only fixed my car, he fixed another body shop's minor oversight at no additional charge to me or my insurance. He went over the repairs with me in detail clearly and concisely. He also provided  advice on how to manage my car dings.  Hopefully  I  won't need you again, but if I do, I'll give you a call. Thanks again.<//Text>

Aaron was so helpful! I had several bad scratches and my quarter bumper had popped out a little. He was able to push in my bumper and buff out my scratches. He presented all options, and didn’t force me to go with replacing the whole bumper if I was ok with a few imperfections. I was really impressed with JP Auto Body Shop and would go there in the future!</Review>

<Review>Everyone that helped me out was so nice. Johnny was the best! He explained everything really clearly and let me know the estimated completion date before I left. It was awesome because if you opt-in to their text program, they text you every step of the way of your repair including when it's ready for pickup, completion date, etc. Best auto body shop I've ever been to!< /Review></record>

I’ve been with couple of body shop before, but there’s no body shop like JP Auto Body in the Bay Area. This body shop is on the top of my list and go to body shop ever since I got my first car fixed by them 5 years ago. From the time I pulled up my car, they made sure I’m taken care of right away even though they seem really busy. The process of dropping off my car, filling out papers and renting a car from them was super duper fast and easy. They rarely made their customer wait and waste their time. Everyone is super duper friendly, they have a really superb customer service. After you dropped off your car, they would send you friendly update on the process of your car and the estimate time of when it will be finished. There’s never a time where they are late on the estimate time. When I picked up my car, it was spotless and clean, shiny on the outside, and dustless on the inside. They vacuum every spot and wipe off dust on the surface inside of my car which is nice of them to do that. Base on the damage of my car, it was pretty fast for them to get my car fixed, which is one of the reason why I love to go to them out of all the body shop I went before JP Auto Body shop.<//text>

Great shop. Johnny was super knowledgeable. Practically knew the history of my car by just looking at it. Repairs were done within the week. They even got the rental car place to bring the rental to the shop. Overall, super pleasant experience</text>

Thank you Peter and Joe! Extremely helpful, Peter saved me close to $400 from another body shop down the street. Very honest, and humble people working here. They quoted me and honor the price for the damages on my car. Also, even gave me a discount for a rental on the spot. Definitely would recommend to anyone is who is looking for replacement, paint job, etc.</review>

Two words: Trust and Professionalism. Ray at JP did a great job explaining the whole process and ensuring that everything would be fixed back to as though the car was new. Even helped get OEM parts for my car when insurance didn't want to. When they found additional damage in their breakdown, they took care of contacting the insurance company to pull everything together need to get all the repairs done. Whole time, they kept me updated on the latest - ensuring that the process was as easy as possible for me. The cherry on top was the fact that they completed the work on time. You've earned a life long bay area customer through this experience!< /text>

<date>1561509810567<//date><rating>5< /rating><Text>I got in an accident the beginning of June and JP Auto was the place I chose to fix my car. I had never brought my car here before, but I'm glad I chose this shop to help with my repairs. Everyone was so nice and when it came time to get my rental, the enterprise agent that was there told me they had a 2019 dodge charger for me for the week! The rental itself was so fun....that added into the great customer service definitely made this a great experience for me. Thank you guys for fixing up my baby back to brand new!! 😍👍< /Text>< Pics>

<Text>Wow...Johnny and his team were absolutely amazing with taking care of of me from A to Z.
I came in to get to parts of my car repaired from a drive by accident. Prior to finding out about JP Auto Body Shop, I had been looking around other shops in the Bay Area. I had an absolutely TERRIBLE experience at one shop located in SSF which left me afraid to even look around after. I even went to the Mazda auto center in RWC and didn't feel comfortable at all getting quotes/help. I got super lucky to have found JP online from a simple google search. There are so many shops around but if you want clear good prices, comfortable auto discussions, and workers that treat you like family,  then JP Auto is the spot. The Manager/Owner Johnny is one of a kind unique business owner with ethics I have never seen before. As a person he s humble, takes time to listen to your auto needs, and gives off great positive vibes while maintaining professional. I truly appreciate how kind he is but he also tells you all costs and necessary repairs needed upfront. Thank you so much Johnny for taking excellent care of me! Thank you for a fast auto repair and thank you making us customers comfortable to discuss car issues. You and the team are top notch A++. Please continue to maintain your business style. Nowadays having shops like yours is rare especially in the Bay Area. Again I can't thank you enough for making me feel comfortable during this transaction. I will always be referring your company to everyone. - Ana Khan< /Text><user_id>105508378524065668045< /user_id><Name>Sultana K< /Name>< Time>

What I really like about this place is the communication and the effort that the employees put in for the clients. Updates through text if not text then you directly. But the one thing that I like is that they were able to out source the estimate for my vehicle in order to get as much OEM parts as possible. Which was great. Many thanks and keep up the good work.</Text>

I am so pleased and happy with the results on my car. I had some work done on my challenger bumper that I was skeptical for finding a good place to have it done fast and efficient. I seen that JP was close to my home and I had a great reviews. I went and I don’t regret it, my car was done really fast and they did a great job, plus peter’s service and attentiveness was on point.
Thank you so much!</text>

At the end of this process, my car looked better than the day I'd purchased it. Any money spent at JP Auto Body Shop is money well spent.

<review>This place is awesome!
I had a minor issue and stopped by just randomly at their place to see if they can help me. Their customer service is hard to match and Aaron Kesler is amazing, not to mention how humble and nice everyone else is. Aaron quickly assessed what needs to get fixed and made sure it gets done right away, he even reviewed a few things in addition to make sure no other issues. The technician assigned to work on my car did an outstanding job and was done with it quickly! Thank you, Aaron and team! Highly recommend this place for your car repair needs . I sure will be back in the future, when needed.< /review>< Pictures>

kept me up to date on everything they did. GREAT work and I got it a few days ahead of schedule. They went the extra mile to earn my business.  This is the only place I will go to from here on end.  They touched up little dings on my car with the extra paint they had left over and gave me a little extra.

Grace is very professional and courteous. Thank you<//review>

After getting rear ended, I was dreading the process of getting my car fixed. Luckily I found JP Autobody! They billed the insurance directly, got me a rental car, and kept me completely in the loop as to the progress of my car. Aaron was very thorough in explaining exactly was would be done and why, and made the whole ordeal super easy; plus, my car looks perfect!  If I ever need any car work done,  I will definitely be going back to them!!</Text>

Someone hit my car and ran away and GEICO set me up w JP auto body and they were the best auto body shop I ever worked with. John helped me out w all me questions and he did a great job fixing my car. Later on when I had another problem and came to see him, he was still willing to help me. He even took a test drive w me and tried to figured out what was wrong. Before I left, someone told me that my brake light was out then they changed it for me for free! They r the BEST< /Review>

<Text>I knew I picked the right auto body shop for the job just by walking in and how everything was in order and clean. Generally automotive repair and body shop is is not a place you would like to spend time at, but when it come to JP auto body that is not the case.

I had a major side panel damage and bumper dent. After finding JP auto online and reading their amazing reviews I have decided to get an estimate for the repairs.

Their estimate was very competitive as well very convenient as I was able to get a rental at the same time.

One week later, I got my car back in the best condition I have ever seen. It was super clean and ready take home

I highly recommend them to anyone looking for auto body shop near San Francisco.<//Text></record></dataset><record>
<Text>I have been here twice. JP body is professional. I left my car with a deep keyed spot and they gave it back to me looking good.They even took their time to fix a leather seat that got unclipped. The best service for auto body needs!</Text>< name>

<date>1547352554794</date><rating>5< /rating><review>I dealt directly with Peter and Johnny. Both of them are class act.

The first time I dropped by, asked for a quote and Peter was the one that took care of me. He dropped whatever he has on hand and asked what happened to the car. Inspected the car and asked a few more questions. Pointed out that the car may be damaged in a couple places due to the nature of the accident (comprehensive - road debris). Because of his experience and what he pointed out, I decided to make an appointment and drop off the car for repair.

They had loaner cars on hand and ready to go when you drop off. Paper work was as simple as 1, 2, 3. The loaner was waiting right in front and I was off on my way. I asked for all OEM parts due to the car brand and my insurance and these guys took care of everything else.

5 business day turnaround. Things had to be replaced, remove, repainted, and reinstalled. They took care of alignment on the lights and made sure the paint matches. Had a slight issue with TPMS when I picked up the car. Johnny and Peter came out and did test drives, offered to check the car again on the lift to make sure nothing was causing the issue. They gave me the rental again and called me a few hrs later to pick up the car.

Funny thing is, my insurance adjuster never called me on anything, not emailed me on the car. But these guys kept me inform about everything.
Will definitely keep them in my phone book and refer people over when they need help with their car.<//review>< pictures>

<name>Jessica Yen<//name><review>First visit:
Simply amazing! I worked with Aaron and he really knew how to take care of the horrible rift that I was in. Long story short, I was involved in a hit-and-run, and Aaron was able to serve as the impartial middle man between myself and the 3rd party. I was incredibly stressed because I did not have time to go back and forth on the phone/or in person, and I was leaving in a matter of days for an international trip. Aaron told me to have a good trip and reassured me that he would remain in contact via text throughout the entire process. I put my faith in JP Auto and Aaron, and they did not disappoint. After my return, my car looked amazing and I no longer had to deal with any headaches!

2nd Visit:
This is my 2nd time working with JP Auto, and again, Aaron and his team delivered high quality service. My car was involved in a hit-and-run accident, so I knew 3 years after my initial positive experience with Aaron, I would be heading back. Not only is Aaron honest, but he is communicative, professional, knowledgeable and direct. It is so obvious that he is passionate about cars, and knows the ins-and-outs of a vehicle. I am referring all of my South City friends and family to JP Auto because of their outstanding service and fair pricing!< /review>< Pics>

<Text>I went in on a Thursday following a very annoying run-in with a parking curb that damaged the lower cowl of my front bumper.  Aaron handled my quote as a walk-in, assessed the damage with me and gave me two options - a bumper replacement (he looked for OEM and non-OEM parts, overall the replacement cost seemed reasonable given what was involved) or they could repair the existing bumper in place (much less expensive!).  He steered my towards the less expensive option, introduced me to Peter who said they could take care of it on Saturday.  Came in, met with Peter, and an hour later my repair was done!  Looks pretty much the same as it did before the accident.  Every step of the way the service was superb and very trustworthy.  I would definitely come back if necessary (let’s hope not) and am grateful for their help to resolve this problem.  Highly recommended!< /Text>< Pics>

Great Customer Service, and overall experience. It all started as I was contacting dealerships and what they would recommend as their best go-to Body Shop, and after the 10th referral, JP AUTO BODY was the consistent contender that kept being referred over and over. Got in contact with Johnny Zhang (one of the owners @ JP Auto Body), and was introduced to Ray Zhang shortly after to deal with a small rear end collision I had been involved in. From the moment I stepped foot into JP Auto Body, I felt like I was a valued customer, and all my questions were answered along with not having to deal with the brunt of the work between my appraiser and insurance and body shop. Ray dealt with all this ongoing paperwork to get payments submitted and processed for my repairs to come into play as soon as possible. He kept updating me if statuses on what had been done on my car and what else was needed, so I was never left in the dark with the repairs. I applaud all the JP Auto Body reps and owners, as well as Ray Zhang who went above and beyond my expectations of dealing with my collision repairs, given I had just bought the car not even a month out, where the car was brand spanking new. Now my car is back in it's fresh out the dealer package look, and I could not be any happier. Thank you for such EXCELLENT EXPERIENCE from start to finish... a HIGHLY RECOMMENDED SHOP.< /text>

<text>JP Auto Body really treated me well as a customer!!! After my BMW got hit in a parking lot, my friend referred me to JP Auto Body. After receiving car services from JP Auto Body, it's really hard to want to go any where else. They are professional, friendly, helpful, and altogether EXCELLENT in skills and customer service. The paint job was  perfectly done. I was also impressed with the shop's decor. I've been to a handful of body shops, but this one looked especially well kept and invested. Not to mention the size of this place is HUGE! I got a chance to look into their new and clean paint room =) Overall, the customer service was fantastic, the workmanship was superb and the price was RIGHT!!! Don't hesitate to check this business out!!!!<//text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Someone brushed their vehicle up against my truck in a parking lot and one of the preferred/no hassle options through my insurance was JP ABS.

Repairs/Paint look great. They were fast and very easy to deal with. Used OEM parts not knock offs. Also, to my surprise they cleaned the interior which is something you don't always see anymore. It was totally unexpected given how dirty my truck was. Would easily use them again.<//review>

My precious 2011 Audi S4 was caught up in a collision and I was looking for an auto body to fix it up. Seeing that one of my coworker recently went to fix up her car and the car was done well, I asked her which shop she went to. I don't want just any auto body though, I am a picky person and needs to see everything first. She told me the address to J P and then I went there a few days after. Upon entering, the first thing in my mind was how big, spacious, and clean their shop was. I was greeted by Johnny and peter, the owner, and I talked to him about my car and insurance. But before I let him do the job, I asked him what is he going to do and if the paint will match up the pearl white. Johnny told me to come over to his spray booth, where he showed me that his booth is state-of-the-art and that the computers will definitely match up the right color so I need not to worry. With more research, I see that their Yelp review consists of multiple 5 stars and he promises that if anything goes wrong he'll gladly fix it for free. With that kind of service, I felt at ease.
When the car was done, he messaged me and told me to pick it up whenever. My car was sparkling white when I came to pick it up and everything was like brand new. The inside leather was shiny and everything was just so perfect. J P really knows what they are doing! If anything happens to my car, I'll surely be back at J P without a doubt.</Text>

After my 2010 BMW got rear-ended, one of my good friend recommended me to JP Auto. When I first entered I was greeted by Johnny and Peter and their shop was amazing! It was the biggest cleanest shop I ever went to. Almost twice the size of any other body shop I had went to. The office inside is very nice and clean, and they showed me their state the art paint booth. After a tour of their shop, they helped me call insurance, brought me to a rental, and even gave me a discount! Wow were they nice people. Everything was done so professionally. The car was immaculate when they fixed it. Great job Johnny and Peter! Will definitely recommend people to this place. A+<//text>

<Text>Very good experience with this body shop. These guys did great work all around.  I liked that they avoid using aftermarket parts!! They are really taking pride in their work!   Had a bumper and rear quarter panel replaced. Geico agent also did a great job on the estimate. He pointed out subtle things that indicated actual major damage that was hard to see.</Text>< pics>

They did a nice job on my car. I went there after checking their Yelp reviews and as it was an Geico Auto Repair Xpress shop. There is a Geico representative onsite and also Enterprise car rental is onsite there. My rental car was ready when i went to drop my car. Both Geico representative and John were awesome. The process is fast. I got back my car in estimated time. They daily update the status of the repair via sms.
They even cleaned my car(interior and exterior), it was like brand new when i got back.<//Text>

< review>
I recently moved into town, I really love a good Chinese restaurant. This was my first time trying Golden dragon. I used an old menu I saw online when ordering, so what I had ordered was not what I was expecting. Which I guess was my fault. They fixed it without any questions. The service was faultless. And the food was absolutely awesome. I definitely recommend.<//review>

I’m working in Ridgecrest and staying in a hotel. I was hungry And just too tired to go anywhere. I decided to have some food delivered so I went to DoorDash. I ordered some of their potstickers. I think there is eight which is too many for one person. Nevertheless I ate almost all of them and they were really good. I definitely will try them again.<//Text>

Dinner was very good, as usual. Fresh ingredients and consistent flavors make Golden Dragon a favorite ! I ordered the 3 Meat Sizzling Platter- chicken, beef and shrimp. Next came Cashew Shrimp for my friend.  I recommend Golden Dragon to anyone who loves Chinese food.

Update : September 2020

I no longer frequent this establishment due to the negative, harsh and greedy displays during Covid19. Treated like cattle</review>

Since the pandemic, they've shifted to ordering and picking up your food outside the store.  Their take out items remain mostly the same< /text>

<Text>Let me start out by saying that the service was wonderful!  They seated us right away, were attentive, were great with my kids, and the food came out in good time.  But the food was awful!  The meat, no matter the dish, was DRY!  Not a little dry, but stabbed my mouth and was more like a chew toy dry.  The sauces were either bland or just a weird flavor.  And the cream cheese won tons were sweet!  Sugary sweet!  I would not go back.<//Text>< gmapID>

I am a coustumer, and I am NOT HAPPY.

I will NOT get back.

Thumbs down 👎👎👎

I rated 1 star for the following:

I went thete on Sunday March 3rd around 4:40 pm ... trying to ask for the old lady on the front desk casheir for the buffet times.
I was desapoited by the horrible way she answerd me, she was rude to me, she left me and went to the kitchen, while I am still there waiting her answer.

And to be honest, I didn't try their food.

The business oweners should treat costumers in a good manner.<//review>

This is normally our go to Chinese food restaurant.   Today though, it was a significant disappointment all around.  The food was bland tonight and the service was a disaster.   The waitress was overwhelmed while only having 3 tables.  On top of the food being bland, which is not typical, the pork in the fried rice tasted OLD.   I wouldn't say we wont go back, as this is out of the norm for them, but expect a quality experience should we return.</Review>

<Text>If I could give this place 0 stars I would, but I would give the 1 star to the waitress, who managed to stay professional and courteous.  The same cannot be said for the Asian manager.  We all ordered different dishes and the food came out at different times. So when we received the noodles, we thought it was apart of the meal. When she (the manager) realized that she give us the wrong order, instead of apologizing and asking us if we wanted it she took up the two plates right in the middle of us dishing it out and scraping it back into the main dish.  I told her she can just leave it since you would have to throw it out.  When I got my bill, she charged me for the food I ordered (one of which I didn't get) and also the noodles. I told her that I wasn't going to pay for food we didn't order and food that we didn't receive.  She argued with me in front of everyone and when I told her that she is extremely rude she said: " how am I rude because I don't want to give you a discount?"  Lady, I was not asking for a discount. Just to pay for the food I did order. To add insult to injury, the food wasn't all that good. The sesame chicken had so much coating with little to no chicken, the three meat platter, had more veges than meat and the little meat we did get wasn't real chicken or beef, and the water (tap) tasted like it was scooped up from the toilet bowl and placed into an extremely dirty glass.

I would highly recommend going to the Xin bowl instead. THIS PLACE NEEDS TO BE CLOSED DOWN!!!< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

<text>We come here pretty often for the lunch buffet. It's a decent price with a small but fair selection of food. They tend to run out of food on the buffet quickly and it takes a while for them to bring more food out. Not a place to go if you're in a rush at all. But overall it's not bad.<//text>< Pics>

Amazing place.  The food is always top notch, try the Terriyaki Chicken Bowl!  The staff is as nice as you could ask for.  It's a fairly small venue, so your wait times may change according to time of day and how busy they are.</Text>

<Text>Of each Chinese food place in town, this one is the best (Tokyo House has them beat but that's Japanese food and Benihana's combined)

If you were to put Golden Dragon in any populated city, it would not be worth the prices they charge for their food.

It is the best Chinese food in Ridgecrest. But you're definitely paying for it.

They were fast. They were also in a hurry and very abrupt (normal for decent Chinese food places) even with very few customers. I'll happily take that for the speed by which my food was prepared.

I had the orange chicken, fried rice lunch special as well as an a la carte shrimp chow mein.

All of it was flavorful and well prepared.

The fifth star being left off is simply... This same food would cost half what it does if it was located anywhere but Ridgecrest or they'd end up shutting down.</Text><pics>None</pics>< response>

Awesome tasty teriyaki bowls! Opt for the $1 extra chicken and you have yourself two meals! Totally worth every penny< /Review>

The buffet is very well done. The buffet changes each day, the food is cooked in small portions so there is particular attention paid to the ingredients. It has a great family atmosphere and is very clean.</text>

Hands down THE best Chinese food in the Ridgecrest area.

I am in LOVE with the Pork Fried Rice, especially at the great prices!

If you can, be sure to go there during the lunch hours & get one of the lunch combos with the wanton soup!

5 Stars!<//text>

Service is super super bad. Ordered over the phone 3 times always wrong order. Always in a rush. Maybe if ya'll calm down a bit you just might get the orders right. bad place for business. I understand everybody isn't perfect but all the time. I'm done with this place.UGH!!!!!!!!!!!</Text>

We ordered the Golden Dragon Hot Pot and enjoyed it very much.  It wasn't as spicy as we like, but the chili oil on the table took care of that.  One order with rice was plenty for the two of us and the service was lovely.</text>

<review>THIEVES— I ordered my food Togo around closing. When I finally made it home I noticied there was Item missing. I tried to call and the place was closed. I called again today to let them know first the owner tried to say she doesn’t know what I’m talking about and why didn’t I call then when I said  I came around closing she stated no you didn’t you came around 7pm.. FUNNY I THOUGHT YOU JUST SAID YOU DIDNT KNOW WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT OR WHEN I CAME. I asked regardless of what I did with my time when I left when I finally got home and noticed the error you didn’t answer so that’s why I’m calling again today. Long story short she acknowledged the error but refused to provide me with the missing item. THATS CALLED STEALING!!!!!</review>< pics>

Usually the food is good, but I ordered delivery last night and it took them 2 hrs to bring it. The Orange chicken had no flavor and the veggies were overcooked, like they had been sitting for a while. Very disappointed.<//Text>

<Review>Avoid!!!
Spent over $50 on a to-go meal.  Food was rotton...as in spoiled.  I was too angry to return the food that night so I waited to cool off.

I tried to return the meal the next day and they said it had been too long.
REALLY?...leftovers would be rotten after 12 HOURS??  I doubt 12 hours in the fridge would change the food that much.  They would not even open the package to inspect their own food products.< /Review><Gmap_id>0x80c1132e0706f715:0x435b1df0393390ab</Gmap_id>< name>

Not to pleased with the food, almost everything had shrimp or mushrooms in it. So since I was visiting with colleagues from work I settled for fried rice and chicken wings.< /review>

If I could leave a zero star review, I would. We placed an order for delivery and was told it would be 30 minutes. 1 hour, 20 minutes later, and two calls in, we cancelled our order with the most rude and disrespectful lady we’ve ever met. Save yourself the headache and don’t order from here!!!< /Text>

<Text>Love the vibe here. Drinks are prompt and strong 👌 SJ was super hospitable and made me feel at home during my very first visit! I will be back! It's everything that I love about a dive bar and more! I can't even count how many new friends I made tonight. Awesome crowd!<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x808fcafefba5e033:0x1d116145e4a9dc0d< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>
<user_id>115464225043106329617< /user_id><Review>Rocco's Ballpark Sports Bar is all new with a beautiful long Stone bar and comfy backed swivel stools. 8 flat screens with amplified sound for that racous game day make it a top spot for sports watching. Pool table with overstuffed couches make for a relaxing game of pool. A beautiful Touch Tunes wall unit and Bose speakers throughput make for a great sound experience. Darts round out the things to do here, oh, and lots of beer on tap!< /Review><Time>1571788780006<//Time><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPrrgDEpN7ObS5cEkzUhSaAuRun89AvwY1yjfHu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMSLK9P1y5E12s_uK0aeILHoXsQDm6-L4YOl4-U=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><Rating>5< /Rating><username>Steve Apker< /username><GmapID>0x808fcafefba5e033:0x1d116145e4a9dc0d< /GmapID>< response>

<Text>The best way I can describe this place is: a modern Brand New dive bar, where you know you are in a dive bar but it feels like you are in IKEA. and so, while everything is clean and nice (check out the restrooms) and everyone can appreciate the higene of the place, it also kinda feels wrong being a dive dive bar... I usually like my dive bars to be a bit sticky and questionable. That said, solid place, music was good, friendly people and decent drinks<//Text>< Pictures>

Rocco's Ballpark is awesome.  Jerry ( the owner is personal and customer driven ). The establishment is not your typical bar. It's theme is Baseball. Memorbila is tastefully positioned in the bar and ambiance is outstanding. Bartenders are friendly and service driven. Try it, you'll be back!!!< /review>

<review>I love this bar!!!! Great for locals who are not in the mood for a rough crowd. Not a college bar like most in the area. Great for pool or darts and a very mellow crowd. This is my go to place after work for a few drinks to take the stess of the day away. I always have a great time. Drinks are strong and bar tenders are AWESOME!!!< /review>< Pictures>

This place seems to always have customers that are friendly as well as friendly staff. Prices are reasonable and the place is always clean. I'll say it is a hidden gem that some local folks have found. Only wish I lived closer.<//review>

<review>I was very disappointed with the service and my main dish at this restaurant.  Wgat I did like was the tofu I ordered and the pineapple mango tea.  What I did not like was that I ordered pan fried noodles with vegetables (they don't have a good vegetarian option) and the noodles very soft on the bottom of the plate and hard on top.  So I guess the noodles were chow mean (soft) on the top, and hard pretty much the top half of the plate.  It dud not really taste very good.  The service was lacking.  The server did not check on me once during my meal.  I won't go back especially because they don't have much vegetarian dishes to offer (they should offer tofu as you can have with your main dish).</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

I was a fan, having gotten takeout here before as well as trying their teas. They are on the five stars app. I came to redeem a free tea, which the app did not mention had any stipulations. I placed the order, and the lady seemed surprised  that I was not ordering anything else. I’m totally fine with percent off coupons for a free item with another purchase, but the coupon had no other stipulations and she simply made up those rules. I ended up walking out of the restaurant.< /review>

<Review>As of September, 2020, the restaurant offers 10% off for online orders with a coupon code (sale10) at gochanoicorner.com and if you order either online (on their website) or on the phone for any order over $15, you will get 1 free Red Tea Hibiscus drink. Free shipping for PostMates orders with a coupon code (I7TNGT).

I Find This The Best Northern Vietnamese Style Cuisine Restaurant in Southern California. Here Are The Main Dishes You Should Try At the Restaurant When Coming to Little Saigon because These Dishes Are Unique and Not Ubiquitous:

- Bún Riêu Cua Lột aka crab, eggs, tomato, fried tofu inside a vermicelli noodles soup bowl.

- Bún Chả Hà Nội aka fried ground pork roll with vermicelli noodles and assorted veggies. This is not a noodles soup, and you eat it like eating fried chicken and nuggets with vermicelli noodles and fish sauce mixed together.

- Bún Đậu Mắm Tôm aka rectangular vermicelli noodles assorted with fried tofu, pork, and chả cốm (green rice fried pork nuggets). This is not a noodles soup, and you eat it with shrimp sauce (mắm tôm).

- Bún Cá Rau Thì Là aka Vermicelli noodles soup with fish filet, dill, and water celery

- Bún Mộc and Bún Thang (Different Versions of Vermicelli Noodles Soup with Different Methods of Cooking Pork).

- Lẩu Hải Sản hoặc Lẩu Thập Cẩm aka Seafood or Combo Hot Pot

- Bún Thái Tom Yum aka Tom Yum Noodles Soup. This is not Vietnamese. We borow the noodles soup from the Thai/Dai ethnic in Yunnan and Sichuan province, present day China.

- Chem Chép Nướng Mỡ Hành, Ốc Hương Nướng Bơ Tỏi, và Nghêu Hấp Thái Xả Quế aka Grilled Mussels, Grilled Escargot, and Steamed Clams Soup, respectively.

Bonus: My Favorite Drinks That I Can’t Find Anywhere Else Are Corn Milk (Sữa Bắp) and Lemon Hibiscus Red Tea (Nước Trà Chanh Dây Nhuỵ Hoa Dâm Bụt).<//Review>< pics>

the Menu of this place is the best for Northern Vietnamese dishes, however, I just regret that the broth soup is very bad, just like water, this ruined everything which the restaurant trying to do! I hope the restaurant takes my comment as a constructive comment and improves.</Text>

<Text>Bun dau mam tom and bun rieu cua lot probably their best dishes. The mam tom sauce is so good but extra order is $0.50c per sauce. The restaurant brings the Ha Noi vibe to you with their signature Ha Noi food and decoration. Overall everything is good.

I was offered a free Seasalt Cream Jasmine Tea in exchange for this review, and call me a sell-out, but I'll play along happily! In seriousness, the food here is so fresh and vibrant-looking, and it as inexpensive as any Vietnamese food place has any right to be. Decor and atmosphere are quirky and contemporary, and the place feels quite clean and modern. Nice to try a Vietnamese Restaurant with a northern twist. Popular and recommended to give it a try!<//review>

The Bun Reui was better than my Moms! (sorry mom)

Everything tasted fresh and authentic. I would highly recommend to come give it a shot.

Matter of fact, i wish i was there right now.<//Review>

Great place to eat the authentic Bun Cha Ca Hanoi or any popular dishes from Hanoi Vietnam.This was the second time we came back to this restaurant. Their foods and services were very good, friendly and fast. We ordered Bun ca thang long, baby clams with rice paper, shrimps goi cuon and bun ca Hanoi. their foods indeed were authentic with smells of dills. I was not a fan of dills before after I ate it at this restaurant last time. I am now in love with it. Overall, I really liked the foods here maybe will try out different dishes next time we come. This place was very cleaned and the Restrooms were also remodeled...<//Text>

I ordered Soft-shell carb noodle ( Bun rieu) + Baby clam with crispy rice cracker. However, I really think they need to improve their customer service. If you share and like their promotion post on FB, you get a FREE brulee cake cream milk tea. I shared and ordered the drink but they forgot. When I almost finished the food, I reminded the waitress again and waited. However, after I finished my food and waited for 5 minutes, I didn’t see my drink so I came to cashier to pay and asked the third time. He immediately made my drink in less than 3 minutes.<//Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM1zsvNFeuoLxH7N4gaGM0of0RNz0JGOC3Xio_Q=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNsHB8ebBrHzSryQrjCwrq4IJ9ekW9LkLnLO5Zy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOLaAmIcs_57DxG3ZJSqeKtAWXWPUJzDT4Es8xd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNd7232NU01qYgZja7TAF2JAIKoa8wicwqv_fdC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x80dd28901cdc306f:0xa39be0546952ebf4</gmapID></record>

I had bun dau mam tom (which include a special shrimp paste sauce,  a salty, fragrant sauce with deep fried tofu, boiled pork belly, deep fried meat cake, noodle and fresh vietnamese herbs.) Be careful with the sauce,  it needs a bit of lemon or lime to balance it out.
Wet also ordered bun Cha Ha noi.

<review>Mediocre northern style Vietnamese food,  their dishes taste normal to me,  nothing's special. Even the most praised dish "bun dau mam tom" wasn't all that. Never,  its probe is very affordable.

My new favorite place for bún riêu! Grilled sea snails with butter and garlic were tender and flavorful $8.50 although shells are feeling apart but didn't affect flavor. Bún chả was pretty good $9 but I recommend asking for another small bowl to eat from combined with noodles and veggies as the pork broth is served in can be quite salty but savory. Bún riêu $9.50 is by far the best I've ever eaten at a restaurant! Interior is very cute and tastefully decorated. Parking can be a bit challenging if you eat during peak lunch and dinner times. They also deliver using Postmates and use Five Star point rewards system. There's also another new location just opened Nov 2019 at Bolsa and Magnolia.< /Text>

<text>We came here on a Saturday night, there was no wait for a table (for four) even though it was busy.  The service was great, the ringers on the tables let them know when you are ready to order and they are there within minutes of pressing it.  We tried several dishes, the soups are fantastic and the garlic escargot are delicious!!<//text>< pictures>

Authentic Ha Noi cuisine in the middle of Orange County. The restaurant design brings you to the street corner of Ha Noi, a very unique feature. Soft music playing on the background. I would highly recommend you to try this lovely restaurant!</Review>

Affordable and delicious vietnamese food. They also have a variety of noodle and rice dishes as well appetizers. Their coffee is also very cheap yet yummy! Would definitely come here again.

Service is quick as well and the place have amole seating.< /text>

<Review>Really great place to get northern Vietnamese food, especially bun mam tom. There isn't too many places that offer this dish, but this place is number #1. Also this place is a low key boba shop/restaurant as well. It boba is high quality same as other boba joint. Definitely recommend this place.< /Review>< Date>

We were surprised at how average the dishes are.  We’re even puzzling at how it got such a great reviews, too.  We ordered the basic northern dishes, grilled pork (bún chả Thăng Long), fried shrimp and sweet potatoes, fried tofu and fish paste dill vermicelli soup, all were very average.< /Text>

< Review>
The food was fantastic, as you can see in the pictures. We got the bun rieu (tomato crab noodle soup), banh cuon (rice paper), popcorn chicken, and corn milk. All were delicious and the biggest surprise was corn milk for me -- who knew corn in liquid dessert form tasted so good?

The decor and atmosphere of the restaurant is warm and modern. The painting in the main dining area is fantastic (you'll know it when you see it).

A great and affordable spot.</Review>

Calm environment with lots of modern decorating, fun for friends or a nice date from the usual spot. Not to mention the prices are very good. Lots of drink options as well if you're just looking for a cafe to find something good at< /review>

<Review>Doesn't not taste like Ha Noi foods. I was expecting a lot, but it didn't meet my expectations. "Chả cá Thăng Long" didn't have enough "thì là". "Bún đậu mắm tôm", the tofu was too dry, the noodles was also dry, fish sauce was not salty enough.< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN2WWSQARvd7WMIPBln_OoJQ5J8kogXQMDjBNQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNuTbKLmkqyng9t-rYNMlrGQNCUmByD57GtZxA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMhHynyAunOqIrgRs-Mtze0E57iAHVq9nPOe6k=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< Resp>

Everything in the menu uses the right flavor for the Northern's food in Vietnam. Highly recommended if you want to try how the Northern's food tastes.< /Review>

This place doesn’t have your traditional beef noodle Pho. When I arrived at the restaurant I was a bit disappointed to find out they didn’t have Pho. Either way I order the Bum Thai Tom Yum and it was pretty good. However, for me, this was a place I tried once and never again. Great Soup but no Pho.<//review>

Yes, yes and yes again. Some of the best North Vietnamese cooking I've had in a long time. We were visiting Anaheim, and this place came highly recommended, so a $24 Uber ride later, it was so worth it. The food comes quick, piping hot and delicious. Next time I find myself anywhere in SoCal, I'll come back!< /Text>

Very good food even for a White Guy. Restrooms are clean staff is friendly. I highly recommend. But,  while you're eating, they shouldn't spray chemical to clean the table next to you.< /Review>

<Text>So far I've tried one thing and I'm hooked the teas are tasty service is great. I wish I could come more often but eating out can be bad if you do it a lot. Never feel super full always leave happy and it always feel like I'm not paying enough for all the food we get.< /Text>< Pics>

This in an interesting restaurant. The smell upon entering is not something you can call pleasant.  It smelled like old fish sauce and a bit of old rag mixed with heavy fish broth. The food came out and it was pretty good, good enough to eat but not good enough to make me want to come back anytime soon. Most of the food came out within 5 minutes of ordering.  It makes you wonder how they get it ready so fast?! We ordered some escargot.  It was heavily garlic-spiced flavored.    If the garlic was cooked out a bit, it would have been better.< /Review>

The food was all delicious (we had bun cha and bun thit nuong cha gio) and the drinks were excellent (passion fruit ice tea with basil seeds and ice coffee).  The server was really friendly. One note: when you're done, you pay at the front. They don't bring the bill to you.</Review>

The new noodle soup was very good. I would rather eat this menu than just regular pho. The soup wasn't greasy perfect for the combination of all the ingredients.</Text>

<text>If you are craving for a good bowl of bún riêu then you are in for a treat at Ha Noi Corner. Their Bún riêu cua lột Hà Nội (soft-shell crab, tomato and tofu vermicelli soup - Ha Noi style) is as good as it gets. The eye-catching broth, the wonderful aroma along with the different textures of the ingredients make their bún riêu cua lột absolutely fantastic. I have been there so many times and only a few times in which I was able to order something else.
Don't get me wrong, they have many delicious dishes here but Bún riêu cua lột Hà Nội is my go to dish!</text>< Pictures>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>I love this place! Portion is very big you can probably share between 2 people if you don't eat a lot. They don't have a lot of selections but every single item on the menu is spot on! Prices are also on the low side - less than $10 per item.

Parking can be a little tricky if you come for dinner since they don't have a lot of parking and you will probably have to park in the residential area right next to it. They also have a rewards program if you come a lot and pay by cash!<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

The food is spectacular and spectacularly affordable. The Cha Ca Thang Long is second to none. The flavor and composition of the dishes are true to its Northern roots. They only lose 1 star for not for serving booze, parking, location, and a bit laxidasicle staff.</Text>

<text>It was my first time eating here and my server was very patient and kind while helping me decide what to order. Not only that, but service is very fast and everyone is very attentive! It is a very wholesome and clean place, a great place for families. The prices are great and the food was amazing. I’m not from this area but I would definitely make the drive again!<//text>< Pictures>

Highly recommended if you're looking for a casual restaurant. Plenty of tables and parking lots. Menu is simple. Food came out pretty on time whenever I was here for lunch. Service and space were normal compare to the price of a one $ place. The reason I keep coming back is their Seasalt Cream Tea, tasty and refreshing! Never forget to order that!< /review>< Rate>

Wish I could order all of it, we had the steamed rice paper with grill pork, beef porridge (clam only available on weekends) and the steam clam with lemon grass. Be sure to save room for their drinks! Sea Salt Thai Green Tea (heaven)< /text>

<Review>I've been here twice this week and the service is fast and accomodating. I was properly greeted at the door and seating was quick. I ordered about 4 entrees and everything came out within 5 minutes.. Probably the quickest service ever at an Asian restaurant. I would recommend this restaurant!!<//Review>< Pictures>

<text>Very different food from what I am used to eating, but I am so glad that I got to try it out. I had the spring rolls in both shrimp and spam. I enjoyed my meal and the rice. The prices are reasonable too! Good service overall.<//text>< rating>

My go-to place for bun rieu!! Must add the mam and fresh chili and it’s perfect. PLUS you get a soft shell crab with it. 😋 I’ve also tried their escargot with garlic butter and pepper and it was good as well. I come here at least once a week!!<//Text>

Love the ambience and the aroma of the food. Some of it is pretty flavorful. Had a bit too much dill in my fish noodle soup. The seasalt cream jasmine tea hits the spot too!

Food was excellent and very well priced, average plate is about 8 dollars and you get a good amount of food. They have a nice variety of lemonades but there are no refills. The motchi ice cream sandwiches are really good but a bit pricey.<//text>

They are known for the bun cha ha noi. Meat patties are super moist and delicious. I like the fact that they use lean pork for their bbq meat/thit nuong. Parking sucks though and on the weekend/holiday forget about service. Last time we ate here they didnt give us our drinks until we were done eating 😑.</text>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>One of my favorite places to eat bun cha Ha Noi. They make it with your choice or regular vermicelli noodles or flat rice sheets. I had tried both and although both are good but the flat rice sheets are my favorite.

Their service is fast and everyone is so nice. They speak both English and Vietnamese. Servers are patient and will make suggestions if you are unsure what you want.

I came here for Mother's day and received a free Macaron Ice Cream sandwich. They were delicious! I would definitely recommend this place! A must try if you are in town.< /review>< Pictures>

<time>1546063008633< /time><Rating>5< /Rating><text>The Bun Cha Ha Noi is satisfying and delicious! It's on the salty side, so definitely have a drink with it. That won't be too hard because they have a large selection of flavored and milk teas to choose from. The honey boba is soft and chewy. It's on the sweet side though, but I liked it. I've been here twice in the past week, and the service is was quick and friendly both times. Depending when you go, parking can be tricky and you may have to park further down the street by the houses if the parking lot is full. The entree selection is smaller compared to other restaurants, but that just means your choices are probably all good.</text>< Pics>

Everything we got was very good, the sauces that accompanied the Spring rolls and the wrap it yourself meat platter was so good. A very nice balance of sweet and salty.

Parking is a pain, very limited. Service was almost nonexistent, but expected. We had to try so hard to flag down a person, but it's not a big deal.

Restaurant is clean and big, we got sat down pretty quick. Only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was the banh duc, a tad too soft, and salty.<//review>

I don't like it the fact that they make you or charged you for tips automatically with the bill. It's not that I'm cheap, but the service is not all that 5 🌟 type. It's not fair for restaurants to forced us the customers to paid for the waiters/waitress salary, especially when no one really check you how you are doing and you have to yell for service. Tips is for good service NOT forced.<//Review>

<text>Modern , clean and spacious. Food is great but my wife, who is from Northern Vietnam, said it is not 100% authentic Ha Noi dishes. Still it is a breath of fresh air since Ha Noi  Corner offers a lot of tasty and unique dishes that I haven't see at any other restaurants in OC.
6/9/2018: still good, but not as good as before.</text>< Pictures>

I love coming here to get my authentic Vietnamese food. They specialize in northern Vietnamese food which is a nice switch from your typical pho restaurant. In addition, they have boba as well! I highly recommend coming here if you’re in the area.<//text>

<Text>Their specialty dishes are delicious. Quite unique too as it's not your stereotypical Viet restaurant with just pho and spring rolls. Great variety and lesser known dishes.

Again try B1 on the menu. Really delicious flavor I haven't seen elsewhere. Drinks are ok but a bit too sugary in my opinion. I would recommend asking for half sugar.

For the price and taste this place is a solid 5/5.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x80dd28901cdc306f:0xa39be0546952ebf4<//GmapID></record>

Food is cheap and it is really good quality. However, The table is small and uncomfortable for our group. Because we have a group of 8 people. Overall everything is good except the uncomfortable table.< /Text>

Got the clams and bun rieu. The clams dish was delicious but bun rieu was ok but the ingredients were very fresh. The waitress is friendly. Overall I would recommend trying it.< /review>

This is my go-to spot for lunch with coworkers. Prices are reasonable and the portion is right. The snails are a miss but their bún đậu mắm tôm (vermicelli with with tofu, boiled pork and vegetables) is good.< /review>

The restaurant is nicely decorated. The food presentation is attractive. The service is friendly. The chilli sauce is fresh and super spicy. The herbs are fresh and clean. The bun cha came out warm and I was envious of my girlfriend's sizzling hot plate of cha ca. The flavor was good. I'll probably go back to try something else from the menu.< /Text>

Well, I got fooled by all the advertisement. Advice to people who want to try good Vietnamese food: this is not the place!!!

Rear parking is limited, side parking is scary and weird.
Inside decor is nice.

Service is bad! They forgot about half of our order, then the waitress came out and ask us "oh the food is not out yet?" Uhmmm I don't work here girl, idk?!!!

Food:
Bun cha Hanoi is supposed to be the signature dish of any Hanoi restaurant here in OC, but they made it poorly: the meat cake was dry, the fish sauce was really salty... If you know Vietnamese cuisine you know that the sauce is the most important part of many many dishes. They failed with this signature one.
Bun dau mam tom was a 3.5/5, I have to give it to them on the mam tom though, they made a good job with the sauce on this dish. Just the cha com was terrible, it's like eating a very moist sticky rice cake being fried...
Bun ca was a disappointment! The soup isn't sour enough. It seems to me like they don't put in the effort of making the different broth for different noodle soup. Bun ca has its own kind of broth, pho has its own kind of broth, bun rieu has its own kind of broth....

In conclusion, I don't like it!!! You might get better dishes than we did maybe.... At your own risk you come in!<//Text>< Pics>

This place had mold in their sriracha bottles. Unfortunately, I realized it after I had some. I reported it to the staff and manager but they didnt seem to care. They didnt even apologize for this. Their food wasnt anything to rave about. I wouldnt come back.</text>

{'time': 1527721709228, 'text': "Annie, We tried to explain to you that it was not mold but you didn't want to understand. It was the ingredients layering under cold AC. The bottle itself was opened a day before and still had the expiration date until 2020. I bet you didn't even read the expire date when bringing it to us. We didn't apologize because it was not even a fault. We just simply answered your question and gave you the explanation you wanted. We did nothing wrong to receive your 1 star but here you go. Again, it was not mold, and yes we did care about the customer opinions and tried to explain to you but you chose not to listen. We are a busy restaurant and only use fresh ingredients to cook, and we don't stock too much to maintain its freshness. If it was mold and if anything wrong happened after you consumed it, feel free to come back and we will show you the receipt of the supermarket we bought it from just a couple of days before so you can complain directly to them, or you can even complain to Huy Fong company since the bottle has the expiring date until 2020. But from our experience and a lot of other consumers' experience, it Was Not Mold, just the layering of ingredients. I'll leave it here for you to Google some more before you bring the same complaint to other restaurants serving sriracha."}<//Response>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>My first impressions of the overall appearance and aroma of the restaurant were, “Suits the name perfectly.” The restaurant is located quite literally on a corner and the inside aesthetically pleases your eyes with the brick walls and dining booths. I visisited this place with my family and we ordered a variety of dishes from Cuon (Spring Rolls) to Escargot to the classic Bún cha Ha Noi (Grilled Pork vermicellli, fresh herbs, and fish sauce). They were relatively tastey and easy to consume. What I would recommend from the Ha Noi Corner specifically is their B1. Bun cha Ha Noi. I swear this is only second to pho when it comes to authentic Vietnamese food and it is amazing! The servers were also quite responsive and friendly. Overall a very nice restaurant for Vietnamese food!< /review>< pictures>

<review>We’ve been here twice in one week! I love viet food because it’s so fresh perfect for this warmer weather and their drinks are on point. The husband liked the bun Thit Nuong and I liked the bun Cha Ha Noi. The salted Carmel milk tea was so yummy! I’ve also tried their lychee drink and that was also super refreshing.<//review><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x80dd28901cdc306f:0xa39be0546952ebf4< /GmapID><Date>1527374324633<//Date></record>

<Review>Writing my review for the free sea salt cream jasmine tea. Otherwise, my opinion is purely my own.

I had the 67. bun rieu and it was delicious! I think it is the best I have had in O.C. I also tried the clam porridge and it was very interesting. The iced coffee macchiato with hokkaido cream was also a treat. I liked all of my ordered dishes and drinks! Would recommend and would come back!

I'm taking 1 star off because there was a piece of plastic wrap in my Gf's porridge lol.<//Review>< Response>

The food here is great!  I especially like the bún chả Hà Nội.  This is also a great place to come for milk teas.  Parking may be a little tough, but I’ve never had a problem since I avoid the busy times.  The only thing missing from this restaurant is alcohol.</text>

Entree was the crab bun rieu. 4/5. Broth was perfect combination of sweet, salty and savory but the half soft shell crab was underwhelming. Honestly, I'd rather have more crab mix, or Cha lua. I think it's all presentation. The crab mix was mixed in a ball too well too. I like my bun rieu crab mix scattered.

I'll want to try another joint before coming back for this bun rieu.< /review>< name>

I love this place, my favorite dish is the Bun Rieu Cua Lot Hà Nội.  My wife introduced me to this dish and I can’t stop eating it.   The service is fast and friendly.  I also had the Bun Cha Hà Nội, very good.  You also have to try the Lychee drink with basil, refreshing.<//review>

I really enjoy dining here at any time of the day.
It is absolutely delicious and the presentation of the food is well represented.

I was craving Bun Cha Ha Noi and found this restaraunt on yelp. I wanted to try a new restaraunt and drove here. The restaraunt is "not in your face" and from the direction I was heading, I had to make a U turn. I did not have trouble finding parking, but this place could get packed.

We were quicklyy seated and the staff were very nice and polite. We sat at the booth and it was spacious. They hire just the right amount of staff that you do not need to chase them down if you needed something. The menu was straightforward and there were photos to go along with the food items. I ordered Bun Cha Ha Noi and my mom ordered a variety platter. The food came out very quickly. The food presentation was adorable with the banana leaf and so. They put a whole bottle of water on your table for your and their convenience. The cups are cute and perfect size.

Bun Cha Ha Noi had the right amount of additives to it, it was very flavorful with vermicelli noodles and the meat were fantastic. They make it just right and perfected the dish that their was no pork smell to it. I really enjoyed it and so did my mom. I have not tried their desserts but can guarantee that their main dishes are worth the drive, at least for me since I am not around the area. I also signed up for their phone list to earn credits to receive freebies, it is a neat concept that I do not see most Vietnamese restaraunt does.

We had such a great meal, my mom asked me to drive her back here again the next time. And again, we had a good time, it was not packed when we arrived in the morning. The service, again, was excellent and the food was yummy. I highly reccommend this restaraunt.<//Text>

<Text>Heard about this restaurant from a friend so decided to give it a try.  Found parking in the rear of the restaurant. The place has nice decor. I ordered the Bún Riêu Cua Bể it came with 1 soft shell crab and the broth is good. I like lots of tía tô with my bún riêu but didn’t came with enough mint; hence, reason for only 4 stars. Will definitely come back to try other dishes<//Text>< username>

The food was ridiculously good and cheap for the price. I tried sooo many restaurants in the area for the right Bun Cha. This place has it right. I was devouring it. Do yourself a favor and came to this place right now!

Still love this place after coming back again!< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

We found this place on FB and decided to give it a try.  We screened thru the menu and pricing is pretty reasonable.  We ordered Tom yum noodles, bun thit nuong and banh Tom co ngu.  Bun thit nuong was delicious. Banh Tom Co ngu could be better if we ate it right away. Tom yum soup was not bad either.  The free sea salt jasmine tea was the bomb.  The server was extremely courteous, excellent service.  We will definitely come back.< /review>

(Translated by Google) Accidentally ran across this shop and was hungry. Try Thang Long Fish Cake. The children brought out very quickly, which meant no need to wait long. Seeing that the noodles and fish bowl are suddenly peeling and the smell is very good already. Eat into the confusion. Prices under $ 10. The restaurant is beautifully decorated with pictures of Hanoi streets. Serve well Ok. The stewardess introduced here delicious rieu vermicelli, which many diners favor. Looking at the menu, any dish I like. Maybe a few days stop to try something else.

Vô Tình chạy ngang qua quán này mà đang đói bụng. Ăn thử món Chả Cá Thăng Long. Mấy nhỏ mang ra rất là nhanh, tức không cần phải đợi lâu. Nhìn thấy măm bún và thố cá đang có lữa kêu lột đột và mùi rất thơm là biết ngon rồi đó. Ăn vào mê muội luôn. Giá cả dưới 10$. Nhà hàng trang trí rất đẹp với tranh ảnh phố Hà Nội. Phục vụ cũng Ok.  Cô tiếp viên giới thiệu ở đây món bún riêu ngon lắm cá nhiều thực khách ưa chuộng.  Nhìn cái menu thì món nào mình cũng thích.  Chắc vài ngày ghé qua thử mấy món khác.<//text>

<review>(Translated by Google) Specializing in selling dishes from Hanoi! The best thing for me is that there is a shrimp-bean noodle soup that is delicious. There are also snail dishes, vermicelli, rice, and noodles made in the Hanoi style. The seats are quite comfortable, the staff here are quite attentive and enthusiastic, everyone can come and try it out!

Chuyên bán các món ăn đến từ Hà nội! Đặc sắc nhất với mình thì có món bún đậu mắm tôm là ngon. Ngoài ra còn có các món ốc hoặc bún, cơm, phở làm theo kiểu Hà Nội. Chỗ ngồi khá thoải mái, các bạn nhân viên viên ở đây phục vụ khá chu đáo và nhiệt tình, mọi người có thể đến thưởng thức thử  xem thế nào!<//review></record>
