<Text>I like supporting local businesses and this shop is cool. My son wanted his first skateboard for his birthday. The staff were helpful, and the owner was nice. I took my son  in and they offered good advice.  This place is small but has a lot of items to choose from.  It could have been overwhelming but we were given information and we decided on a complete board that was already assembled rather than a true custom board.  He picked a complete that had a graphic he liked.  He is a satisfied customer as am I.  I will go back and replace my deck with a blank.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x80c2b507e6986927:0x4e93559a643541b8</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Dude is a god at gripping boards, I've been to ripcity in Santa Monica and they aren't nearly as good. I don't think I could've done a better job myself, actually I know.

This has to be one of the best skateshops in south bay area. The staff are very helpful to pros and beginners alike. They have a large selection of items. If you buy skate board stuff they can put it on for you.</review>

South Bay Skates is by far the best skate shop in the area. It has a massive selection of boards for a reasonable amount. This store has just what you'll need from scooters, skates wheels, boards, etc.  The owner is a very friendly person and helped me find exactly what i was looking for. Not to mention their amazing museum.<//Review>

Guy pulled out a tazer and started zapping it while i was trying on sunglasses because he was scared. Small dirty mirror above a fishtank didn't let me get a good look so i just bought the $100 shades because he was making me nervous with the tazer. I got home and didn't like the shades aterall. Went back the next day to return them and they wouldn't. Don't give your money to these shady dudes.<//text>

Dr. Lee knows what he’s doing and compassionate, he did examine and found all the problems that caused my severe pain, he also listen to patient concerns and advise appropriate course of actions. My experience with roots canal and molar extraction were great.

Extremely grateful to find Dr. Lee and his staff. They are prof, informative and kind. I'd definitely recommend LA center to anyone who need its service.<//Text>

The staff were efficient and knew every detail of my case and needed services. The Doctor, Dr. Park,  was expert in his knowledge and skill. This Dr. was a pro among pros and they used state of the art equipment in providing what was needed for me.
Set my mind at ease and explained in detail every procedure that was being performed on me(Root Canals). The mystery was clarified and pain was virtually, minimal. Also quick and efficient in delivery of the procedures. I highly recommend Dr. Park and the staff at LA Center For Endodontic Services should you ever need Root Canal procedures performed.< /review><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2b89d2b8036cf:0x84a8fbd7ea080e27</Gmap_id>< Pictures>

Excellent and friendly staff, it was super easy to make an appointment.
Dr. Mindo Lee is such a professional in his field!  I liked that he was very honest and I didn’t feel forced into a decision I would not be comfortable with - he thoroughly explained the procedure, the recovery from it and what were the chances it would be successful, (in my case it was retreatment of my infected root canal) so you know what to expect.
He was able to save my tooth by performing retreatment (couple dentists before him were saying that I absolutely needed to extract it). Needless to say I was very glad I didn’t listen to them and came to Los Angeles Center For Endodontics.
Now it’s all healed and I couldn’t be any happier! Thank you, definitely would recommend this clinic.</Review>

Dr Lee is the only endodontist that my trusted, long time dentist recommended for my root canal.  After my experience today I can see why he is so highly regarded.
Dr. Lee is an excellent, highly skilled endodontist.  Despite my complicated dental anatomy that made my case challenging, my procedure was quick, efficient, and surprisingly pain free.  His staff is professional and friendly, and there’s plenty of free parking on site.
I highly recommend Dr. Lee and staff.< /review>

<Review>I would come back here & see Dr. Mindo Lee, he’s a great listener & was able to put my anxious self at ease, which I greatly appreciated. He took the time to explain everything he would be doing before & during my procedure. Anytime he noticed I was in any type of discomfort he would stop, reassess, and make sure I didn’t feel a thing. His staff was very knowledgeable efficient & friendly.Thank you to you & your staff for your great care!</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<review>Nothing fun about a root canal but Dr. Lee & his staff made it a short a visit as possible! At one point, I was cold, and they gave me a blanket & turned off the a/c. Their whole goal was to make me as comfortable as possible. Although his office is not anyone near my home, I would highly recommend him and see him again the need arose.<//review>< Pics>

<review>I came all the way from Long Beach to get seen.
I was in so much pain due to a root canal that needed retreatment.
Dr. Lee and his staff got me in the same day.
The front desk was kind and courteous.
And Dr. Lee is detailed and explained everything before starting procedure.
I can tell he genuinely cares about his patients.
I am so appreciative of him and his staff.
I been in so much pain for so long, and I finally found someone that took care of me and my tooth.🦷
Thank you Dr. Lee,
You guys are the best!
I Recommend anyone looking to get a root canal or retreatment root canal to come to this office.
They will take care of you❤️<//review></record>

It was the early morning on MLK holiday, 1/18/ 21 when I called this place for an appointment.  I was very pleased with the timing and the service with this Dentistry. They scheduled me about one hour after I called them for an appointment.  It took about another hour for Dr. Lee to finish the Endodontic treatment on my tooth. So it took around 2 or 2 1/2 hours from the time I called to schedule the appointment to when I was done with the root canal treatment.
Dr. Lee was very courteous and professional.<//Text>

I was very impressed with Dr. Lee and his staff.  They were very professional, efficient and friendly.  The office was very clean and they adhere to all safety precautions during the current Coronavirus pandemic which really helped put my mind at ease.

Though I live in the Valley, and the office is in Koreatown, I highly recommend Dr. Lee.  After doing extensive research, I went to Dr. Lee because I needed a qualified Endodontist and was not disappointed.  It is always hard to trust strictly based on Yelp or Google reviews since you never know who is writing them.  But Dr. Lee is by far the best Endodontist I have ever been to and is well worth the drive.  They even have Saturday appointments available which makes things very convenient if you work during the week.  In addition, they have a parking structure, at no charge, that provides ample parking and each level has direct access to the building.

I had to get a root canal retreatment on 01/29/21 of my front upper right tooth (also known as the #8 tooth).  In addition, I had developed an infection above the tooth that needed to be cleaned out as well.  It had been over 30 years since my last root canal and had to be completely redone.  Dr. Lee was very patient and thorough in discussing all of the 3 options as to how to accomplish this.  And while the option I chose meant that the whole process would overall take longer than I would have hoped, it also provided me with the best chance of success in getting it fixed right in one shot rather than repeated procedures.

With any dental surgery there is always the fear of pain, and especially how much one might experience.  During the procedure I did not experience any pain aside from the 2 stings of when he injected the Novocain which is to be expected.  In less than an hour, he had completed the procedure including the cleaning out of the infection.  As I was checking out, he even provided Ibuprophen to help with the swelling and pain that eventually did come after the Novocain wore off.  However, I was already prepared for this since I knew he had had to go deeper to clear out all of the infection.  The pain throughout the weekend was easily managed by Ibuprophen, and as I write this 3 days later, I am back to normal.

I truly appreciated Dr. Lee and his staff for all of their help in fixing my tooth and highly recommend them if you are in need of an excellent Endodontist!</Review>

When you're in pain from a root canal, this is the place you want to go. They're so friendly and caring, and even helped me out with insurance-related miscommunications, both times I've been there. They really listen to the patient.< /Text>

Melissa at the front desk was efficient. When I emailed her my x-rays prior to my visit, she let me know that she had received them. She promptly emailed me back my treatment plan, including costs. The costs were surprisingly reasonable; in the end I even paid much less than the treatment plan's estimate.
The front desk ladies were nice.
Dr. Lee was very pleasant and encouraged me to try to save the tooth with a root canal rather than an extraction and implant. I was hoping that he could do the work that day and he did. It was quick and painless. Afterward, I never felt any pain at all. Be advised: after the root canal, you must return to your regular dentist and get a crown to cover that tooth. That is more expensive, so you may want to find out that cost in advance. I wasn't aware of that. Dr. Lee was kind, quick, and painless.<//Text>

Please give them a visit. The whole place is clean, friendly staff and can accommodate you in every way. There’s also a parking structure in the building so no need to worry about that. You will be taken care of here. Thanks again!</text>< Pics>

Thank you so much for treating my tooth!!! I had the worst pain in the past few months and needed a root canal... during the time of quarantine it was extremely hard to find a doctor, I tried several clinics before  which didn’t seem professional and the staff was rude and trying to trick me with my insurance payment. Although LA Center For Endodontics were very welcoming and professional. They scheduled my appointment very fast and already less than a week after my first visit I had my root canal done easy and stress free. I really appreciate the professional doctors that were taking care of me and the rest of the staff. Also the office itself was very clean and they follow all the Covid-19 guidelines... Recommended!!!< /Text>

The referring doctor was impressed with the build up and the report.  The office was very modern and clean AND he does not over sell or over charge.  SIMPLY THE BEST< /review>

I was referred to Dr. Lee by a friend and I am extremely appreciative of their excellent  customer service along with top notch professionalism, especially during Covid-19. All precautions are taken very seriously. Every person starting from the front desk receptionists leading back to the patient room with Dr. Lee and his two amazing dental assistants are extremely patient, kind and comforting throughout the entire process. They show genuine concern for your comfort and interests and will kindly walk you through your procedure with clear details and provide you with great treatment options. If you are deciding whether to choose Dr. Mindo Lee as your Endodontics dentist, please go right ahead and do so. You won’t be disappointed.<//text>

And he did excellent work in an efficient timeframe! Thank you for working and being of service to others during these uncertain times. Special thanks to Melissa who was very patient and helped me wrangle my insurance. Five stars!<//review>< response>

<Review>Dr. Mindo Lee he is a angel come from the heaven.
I am very thankful with him because he open my eyes today and took away all the fear and panic I have on me since I was a child. I wasn't even a regular patient of him and he went out of her way to help me in my panic mode. You can bet I am now her regular patient. Thanks Dr. Mindo Lee

I've never written a google review in my life, but this place clearly deserves 5 stars, so I had to! Absolutely wonderful staff in the front office and the back staff too especially Dr. Lee and Alex . I had to have an emergency root canal, today and Dr. Lee was so patient and helpful he explain everything before doing it. DR. LEE IS THE BEST ENDODONTICS IN LA. Everyone in the office really helped me stay calm and went above and beyond in making sure I felt better. I can't say enough good things about this place. If you're looking for a new dentist- go here! I highly recommend them to anyone.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>Dr. Lee is extremely skilled and professional. He explains what he’s doing and why and makes you fee comfortable. I had zero pain besides some jaw tenderness. I was desperate for a root canal on a Saturday and he was one of the few endodontists opened in LA area. They squeezed me in and solved my issue. The ladies at the front desk were fabulous, caring, kind and professional. The Dr’s assistant were caring and skilled and once again Min Do Lee in a rockstar!
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND DR. LEE!<//text>< pics>

The receptionists were amazing and got me a consultation the day I called, then I came back a few days later for the procedure. The doctor had a the lightest hand and my root canal was handled beautifully. I didnt even need to take any of the pain meds afterwards. If you need a root canal or think you may need one, look no further. This place will take care of you just like they did me!<//review><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x80c2b89d2b8036cf:0x84a8fbd7ea080e27< /GmapID></record>

<text>Dr. Lee is the BEST endodontis with a heart to his patient and have an amazing and wonderful staff.  Thank you Dr. Lee for not giving up my case even to the point that I myself want to give up. My case is a complicated one and it’s a challenge to you and your staff. You did everything that you could do to help ease my pain. I’m painless now as if nothing happen. I would highly recommend Dr. Lee to my family and friends. If I ever need another root canal and other dental problem I will definitely go back to him.</text>< Pics>

I booked Dr Lee, last minute and he was willing to take me the same day. I'll be honest I was pretty skeptical when I walked into the building, however their office is very nice and the receptionist was welcoming. This was actually one of my best dental experiences I've ever had! I walked in with a terrible toothache and left without so much as an ounce of pain. Dr Lee was a wizard with the needle and I never even felt so much as pinch from the numbing shots, let alone any discomfort during my root canal procedure. I will definitely be recommending him to my friends and family in need, and should I ever need another root canal, I'll definitely be coming back to him.<//review>

<review>Dr. Lee is hands down the best endodontist I have ever been treated by. He is a true expert endodontist! I needed a root canal after waking up with excruciating sharp shooting pains. I immediately called LA Center for Endodontics and was quickly scheduled to come in to see Dr. Lee. As soon as I left his office, my excruciating pain and pressure was literally eliminated, totally gone!! The procedure itself was actually painless and quick. I had no idea that any of this was even possible. I was waiting for the pain to creep back but it never did. He's a miracle worker... if you ever need a root canal then I cannot recommend LA Center for Endodontics highly enough. It is a stretch to say that having a root canal is a pleasant experience but I can confidently say that having my root canal done with Dr Lee was the best dental experience I've ever had! His staff is awesome, his office is really nice, the office has an attached parking structure with complimentary parking and he is a skillful master so you're in the best hands for your treatment which matters  most.</review>< username>

I came in for a root canal which already had me anxious and nervous because I've never had one. Dr. Lee reassured me and even made my nervous self laugh. His anesthesia procedure was painless. His staff were all nice and they all seemed to get along perfectly with each other. Overall, best endodontist I've ever had and an amazing, wonderful staff. Thanks Dr. Lee!

<text>My mother went to pick up her order and they charge her $75 for 3 meal by mistake. She explained this is a mistake cancel it and please ring it up for the right price. Three women kept yelling and arguing with my mother. She said forget cancel the transaction we will pay for it in cash because she wanted to our meals and to go home. I will never buy anything this China express again. There was zero reason for them to resort to yelling to resolve a problem.</text></record></dataset><record>

The gentleman running the front moves through the customers quickly but is quite thorough with the service. He's a decent entertainer too. The food is full of flavor! Definitely earned a regular customer. Do yourself a favor and try the paper wrapped chicken.<//review>

I didnt really like this place before but It had new ownership and i had to try it. The food tastes much, much better and workers were pleasant. Funny enough I've been there now 3 times in 2 weeks that's how good it is. For sure the "go to" Chinese food spot for me now< /Text>

First time at China Express and I must say I was sadly disappointed. The rice was extremely dry and the orange chicken tasted as if it was either over cooked or reheated. It taste like rubber dipped in sauce. The rice was definitely not fried. The cashier asked if we enjoyed the food and I just smiled with a slight laugh and left. I tried to eat as much as I could but I was literally nauseous afterwards. Next time I’m starving for food I’ll just have someone else pick the restaurant. Sorry for the honest review but I literally wasted money and wish I could’ve gotten a refund.< /review>

This place is one of Santa Clarita’s best hole in the wall Chinese food spots , in my opinion the food is way better then Panda Express ,
My parents have been coming here for about 20 years , i was a child when they used to bring me here and we still come once a week to eat
The serving sizes are incredible , we always get to go and the food is bursting out of the container , more bang for your buck 100%
Don’t let these negative petty reviews tell you otherwise< /Text>

I went here today for the first time and I have to say this is by far the most organized and cleanest dollar tree I have ever been in! Even during the holiday season it was so neat. I will be back to this particular store. Everyone was friendly and helpful as well. A+++< /Review>

It's Friday 9:20am and the doors are locked. Website says open so I call. Unfortunately the person (woman) who answers the phone answers rudely and with frustration in her voice. When I ask if they are open she responds rudely and shares they won't be open until they are done counting inventory. I asked if she has an estimated time and she again rudely responds "I said not until we count inventory and phone hung up. If you are having a bad day I would suggest have someone else answer the phone, take a break and try to regroup. Don't take it out on customers. Thanks ♡<//text>

The employees and manager are all rude and lazy. IDK how these people have jobs in customer service, let alone do my job 1 day a year better then I have been doing it for 5+ years. Terrible all the way around.</review>

Costumer service is bad. Today I went to get some seeds for my little sister's school project and when I got to the register she rolled her eyes when I asked if they were really 4 for 1. Then when I was going to pay I realized I had forgoten to go to the bank to exchange the rolls of pennies and quarters, so I tried to pay with that but she kindly said it was against store policy to take rolls. Yeah I understood that so my aunt dug through her bag to see if she had any money we pooled together like 11 dollars in cash and like 6 dollars in quarters. At this point I noticed she was getting annoyed so I tried to hurry it up. Then when we handed her the money she scuffed and rolled her eyes at the fact that she had to count 24 coins. Like seriously, counting money is part of your job so do it, plus MONEY IS MONEY. Im pretty sure the store owner wouldn't mind a customers paying with change. Honestly this experience has ruin dollar tree for me my aunt was so upset I had to drive. Holly the cashier if you're reading this I hope you have a good day cause if you get upset about customers paying with change than every day must be a long day for you.<//Review>

Mike assured me the team would examine the tire damage for reparability and get us on our way again.  As it turned out, our tire could be patched and Josh expertly handled the repair.  DeYoung's swift and professional diagnosis no doubt saved us hundreds in unnecessary tire replacement and allowed us to continue our summer road trip without delay.

< review>
I am now a customer for life! I originally found DeYoung's Automotive after my previous mechanic could not figure out a stalling issue that I was having on my older truck. I dropped off my truck at DeYoung's and they had it diagnosed within the day and fixed the following day. I have since gone back for an oil change (no up-selling which was nice) and most recently an alternator problem. I had my truck towed in midday to find out that they were quite busy. But they went out of their way to squeeze me in and get the job done within a couple hours while I waited. Good thing because I needed my truck the following day for a trip to Big Bear.
I have had nothing but great experiences with the office staff and mechanics. Everyone is professional, friendly, and always upfront about the price of my repairs.
And what I really like to see at my repair shop is a variety of vehicles they work on. The last time I was there they were working on old classic cars, new modern cars, and everything in between. It seems like they work on just about anything. The times I have been there I saw repairs being performed on work trucks, motor homes, motorcycles, and even a battery installation on a boat.
Even though DeYoung's Automotive seems to be busy when I'm there, I always feel like I am their priority. They get me in and out in a very reasonable time. I would give them 10 Stars if I could.
Thank you everybody at DeYoung's Automotive. You all are a lifesaver when it comes to my truck!!!
P.S. I just got my DMV registration in the mail and it says I'm due for a smog inspection, so I'll be back in a couple months.</review>

If there was a six star I could give it to this place! Professional, efficient and honest. I needed a device installed in my car and I called them to book an appointment. They advised me over the phone that it might take longer to do it on my car as it is a hybrid. I love upfront honesty! When I stepped into the office what struck me right away is the professionalism from LON, the owner and the tidiness of the place. My 'case' was passed onto JOSH (I believe, the manager), who was also very professional and comforting with exceptional people skills. He was the middle man between me and the technician, who had difficulties to finish the job due to another company's unwillingness to provide adequate instructions. Despite longer waiting time due to the above mentioned issue I left as a happy customer! I will recommend them to all my family and friends. No surprise why this company is still in business today!<//review>

Honest estimate on the repairs to the vehicle, catalytic and smog systems. The cost of the repair was slightly less than the value of the vehicle, 2001 Nissan Altima.  Time for a new car.< /Review>

{'time': 1582915279748, 'text': "Hello Robbie. I'm sorry you feel that you were led on, but your statements are just wrong. When you came in, the first thing we discussed is that the  labor rate on motorhomes is more than your average passenger vehicle due to their size and difficulty to work on. Additionally we had to diagnose a multitude of non related problems on your motorhome. And on top of that, before coming in, you attempted and failed to do some of your own repairs, which further complicates the diagnostic and repair process. Again, sorry you feel the way you do, but please realize motorhomes and their repairs are inherently expensive. Just check with Camping World or any repair shop that specializes in motorhome repairs and I bet you will better understand what I am saying."}</resp>

<review>I have been going to this place for years for all my automotive needs and have had only good experiences.  They are fair with their pricing and the work is done well.  I even got some of my family and a few friends to start going to DeYoung's Auto and they are all happy so far.</review>< Name>

<Review>Long story short I will never refer or go to a place that doesn’t communicate the exact price prior to completing the work. Jack not only didn’t call  me to give me the exact price because as he put it he assumed I was ok with the estimates he had given me which was minimum of 1100-1400. When I tried to have a conversation with him at the location it didn’t turn out so well. We both ended up yelling in the office in front of other customers and he even offered to take parts out of my car if I wasn’t happy. When I asked which parts he would take out he said he would take out the differential and I could have my car towed. I have never been treated to rudely and disrespectful in a professional environment (I assumed it was professional).</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>
{'time': 1522268657913, 'text': "I must say that I am a little surprised by this negative review. Our technician went above and beyond for you. To begin, he worked late to finished the repairs on your vehicle several days earlier than promised because of the urgency in which you needed your vehicle back. He also discussed with you the range of what the price of the repairs would be depending on the severity of the internal damages on your vehicle. You agreed that if we stayed within this range to continue with the repairs. The repairs came to be a little over $100 less than what you had agreed on. And then when you came to pick up your vehicle and you were for some reason unhappy with the price, we took off another $120 from your total invoice. And yet you still were not satisified.\nDeYoung's Automotive is a small family-owned business and we understand the importance of customer satisfaction. We try our best to take care of all our customers, but I guess our best wasn't good enough this time.\nDeyoung's Automotive will continue to take care of our large base of returning and new customers now and into the future."}< /Response>

Women Beware.  De Young has a crew of misogynists.  Six years ago I went in to have my air conditioning   fixed and within fifteen minutes they tell me I need a new compressor at the tune of $600.  I opted not to have it done and lived with no air for six years.  Now my husband goes in with my car to finally fix the air and they say all it need is a recharge and Freon.  Three weeks later I just happened to check my heater and now it doesn’t work.  It did before.   Of course, they take no blame and say it’s just a coincident.  Four years ago I had some axle work done and the next day, driving along the axle went and I had it towed back to them only to be told they forgot to tighten the bolts.  I’ve been a fool doing business with them for the last fifteen years.  Well they just lost a customer!  Not good business.</review>

By far one of the best experiences I've ever had at an auto shop. The staff was honest professional and most importantly they were very helpful. My car broke down across the street and I was very low on funds so I wasn't expecting them to do much for me but they went way beyond expectations and not only did they take a look and find the problem (alternator) they even charged my battery for 30 min so I could at least make it home. They wouldnt wouldn't even accept a tip! as soon as I get the funds together I know just where I'm going to get my car fixed. Their customer service was excellent and treated me with respect and gave me at least an hour of their time even though they knew I didn't have much cash. I definitely recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a shop that is knowledgeable and courteous. While most places are out for a quick buck this shop really seems like they authenticly like to help and come off as very fair. I will be back very soon</Text>

<Text>I didn't like this place at all. It is apparently run and managed by one person and he is NEVER around.  I know this because I had to go there a series of 10 times to do smog. He does NOT know what he is doing. He kept telling me to get on the freeway and drive 30 minutes and come back. He told me 6 times!!! He wasted my time over and over. You always have to wait for him to come. he dissappears into some building with stairs that I think he lives at. Go anywhere else but here. He will waste your time and not pass you.</Text><time>1338442181839< /time><Gmap_id>0x80c29c3f8fef3d29:0xfdafde7852e609d0<//Gmap_id>< resp>

This place is nuts. For a smog test they charge 57.00 dollars while pep boys only charges 35.00.
What a rip off. Take your business somewhere else people.</review>

Very friendly and wonderful women here at this shop. Make sure you sign in and provide a good phone number: the new waiting in line. ✌️</text><userid>100749452642570202135< /userid>< Pics>

Usually I get a great haircut, but you have to go to the same guy. Idk if he still works there but he was great. I agree with another review, the lady who cut my hair was rude and actually drew blood when I asked her to use the razor, not the machine. Before I sat down I asked for a straight-razor fade which is usually no problem. Halfway through she was about to use a beard trimmer and said it was the same. I disagreed and I asked her nicely to cut it with the razor the she literally complained that I was like a lady who asked her kids' hair to be cut with scissors.< /Text>

I recently moved to Fontana area about 1 year ago I've tried many a barbershop but nobody can beat Franks service all chairs know how to cut hair great ....and once they get to know you...you will never have to speak a word they know how to cut your hair and the prices are great also! I go to Frank's number one... there are several other locations!</review>

I always bring my son here. They are friendly and do a good job. I do have to add that their prices have gone up from 10 dollars to 12 and now 14.   I  recently went  and  payed 14 for the hair cut, 2 for tip plus the 1 dollar fee for using my card. Total of 17 dollars for a kid hair cut.</review>

<Review>My sister and I had the most incredible time at Susie Q Ranch during the weekend of October 10th!
First, the entire staff is truly incredible. Susie Q herself met us at our car to say hello and get our paperwork locked in. We had arrived nearly 30-minutes early to our ride (the first one of the day) and so we were allowed to help brush down some of the horses. I can't begin to describe to you how joyous that was. For two people who have ached for the presence of a horse we were over the moon getting to help prepare these horses for their ride.

Second, the attention to detail was deeply appreciated. My sister and I are experienced riders and we wanted to go on a private 90-minute ride that would allow us to really ride again. Susie assigned us two horses with great personalities and our trail lead was great to offer plenty of opportunities on the trail to get up to a trot and gallop! We were in heaven truly!

Third, the team was kind and let us hang around the ranch after to feed our horses some carrots and spend time with the other animals.

Cannot recommend this ranch enough for any horse back riding adventure you may be looking for! You're supporting a wonderful ranch and a great staff by choosing Susie Q Ranch!<//Review><Date>1602519426286< /Date>< username>

<Review>After reading all of the great reviews online, I was really excited to go here. I took my little sister here for her birthday, and we were surprisingly disappointed. I really, really wanted to like it here...

No one including staff and guests were wearing a mask. While we were outside and distanced, I asked if my sister and I were able to take off our masks and she said “no... because one of us had to...” I was confused because no one else was wearing a mask. I wondered why just us? There are other guests around. Was it because we were both... Asian? I became uncomfortable but brushed it off.

It was only my sister and I in the tour group for the 90 min ride and it was our first time ever riding a horse. Our tour guide didn’t introduce herself, didn’t talk to us the whole ride, and didn’t explain anything about horses or the environment. She rarely checked up on us, and at the end of the tour, didn’t say goodbye and just left. Another lady who I assume is the owner came to take a photo of us, helped us get off the horses, and that was that. No other comments or even a good bye.

I was confused because all of the reviews said that the staff were friendly and informative... I thought maybe I missed something or if this was how horseback riding is supposed to be... In a time of a pandemic combined with the recent stigmas against Asian communities, I wondered if we were being treated this way because of our race even though we were born and raised in Orange County. It did not feel like a tour, because no one talked to us or even treated us with respect. Regardless, I did not feel welcomed. The horses themselves were well trained and wonderful, but the overall experience was a little jarring. I was confused because I had never experienced anything like this from anyone before, maybe because I am usually with other white folks... It was really disappointing, but had to share my experience to hopefully create change in the way they treat their future visitors.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>{'time': 1615370300366, 'text': 'I am sorry . I meant  that it was a good Idea to wear a mask while i was mounting you on the horse and adjusting your stirrups then you could take it off while riding. I was surprised when you came back with your mask on.\nI usually wear mine  when checking customers in but i reached in my pocket  and it was not there.\nIts hard to have a conversation while wearing a mask.\nI would like to offer you to come back and ride with a different guide  no charge.'}</resp><Gmap_id>0x80db7d84400bc851:0xe2fb4eab7a6290d3</Gmap_id></record>

The guide was great, very informative and interesting things to share about the ranch and the surrounding area. These are clearly passionate horse people and it shows. Horses are healthy and trail sturdy. My friend and I are experienced rider and we would have enjoyed a more challenging ride if possible, but the stroll through the hills was still incredible. Beautiful scenery, great experience. I’m already planning to bring my daughter back here when we return in the Spring.</text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM0j1pLv7Uv8XZIKwr-6fbKg07YTiA2jqTD-I8_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< response>

After reading so many great reviews, I decided to take my daughter there to go riding. It was such a great experience. The ranch, the horses, the staff....everything was awesome. We had a great hour ride with a great guide that was a pleasure to ride with. Everyone we dealt with was kind and polite, and we can’t wait to go back again.< /Text>

We decided to go horseback riding on pretty short notice during a trip to the Temecula area.  We found the reservation / booking process very easy and Susie was responsive to text messages with some of our questions. When we arrived we were greeted immediately and we were on our horses within minutes. Our guides were Moya and Sierra (Sierra was a volunteer student) we had a nice 90 minute ride through the hillsides around eastern Murrieta.  Sierra was very sweet and polite.  The horses were also very nice and we had absolutely no issues.  If you are looking for some horseback riding in this area we can recommend this stable</text>

I had no boots, and they lent me a pair.  The trail guide was nice, and took great care of the horses we took out that day as it was extremely hot.  They are healthy beautiful animals.   I enjoyed my visit.<//text>

<text>My daughter and I wanted a Californian horse riding experience. We came to visit my son in the Navy and it is well worth the drive from San Clemente. Staff are super nice. The view is awesome. Thank you for making our visit complete with the trail ride.<//text>< Pics>

Susie and the entire team were welcoming, well prepared, friendly,  and great with our kids. We had two little kids with us and they were amazing with both of them with instruction,  pictures,  conversation, etc. Their horses were behaved, friendly, and gentle with kids. Just a great place to ride and we will be coming here again on our next vacation.< /text>< Pics>

<review>Location was beautiful and clean. Susie, Hailey, and Alex were all very helpful. Especially Hailey, our tour/ride guide, who was very professional, kind, informative, interesting, and helpful. All of the animals were beautiful and friendly. A beautiful border collie even greeted us with his frisbee as we were exiting our vehicle. The ride was scenic, comfortable, and safe. An outstanding experience in every aspect. Thank you.</review><Rating>5</Rating>< GmapID>

<text>Our experience at Susie Q was a great one. We all had such a good time! The horses are so sweet and gentle. My 8 yr old grandson enjoyed himself on Elmo. Bill was a great guide! Some of the horses are rescue horses and everyone here works on a volunteer basis! Make sure you tip them good for their time, we sure did! They were all very friendly and it was a beautiful ranch! They even let us feed the horses apples and carrots afterward! We will definitely go back over and over again!< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

Susie Q Ranch is full of fun! There are over 15 horses and I am sure to tell you which ever one you get on is so sweet. You will get an amazing experience from the staff and owners. I can't  express enough whether you have a party, lesson, or trail ride it will be an amazing experience. I would recommend Susie Q Ranch to anyone who wants to learn how to ride or doesn't know how to ride and just wants to get a taste of how it feels.< /text>

My daughter and wife went riding, they love horses, they said that Susie and Cowboy Bill took pictures, helped them with getting cowboy boots to fit, made sure they had their water on the saddles.  They made the experience an experience of a lifetime.  Thank you Susie. .<//Review>

The veggies we're all cut very elegantly and the flavors were well combined. I especially enjoyed the Middle Eastern salad. Very tasty bean salad. I also liked the lentil soup. The hummus was also outstanding. I didn't have the kabob, but my wife enjoyed it. Worth coming back to try the other dishes.<//review><GmapID>0x80c295e873decbed:0x57c96c58209ecafe<//GmapID>< Rate>

<review>My husband and I can't get enough of this place! My favorite is the Chicken Lule kabob plate. All their sides are great so you can't go wrong. I recommend the yogurt with cucumber and the shirazi salad. My only advice is to call ahead to order.<//review></record>

< review>
I have ordered from this place numerous times before and have never had an issue whatsoever. But I unfortunately need to justify my rating due to the fact that a few days ago when I ordered, I got food poisoning. I was in pain for the next 2 days and I believe this is the last time I will order from this location because that means someone during food handling, did not either wash their hands, contaminated the meat, or improperly cooked the meat. There may be other factors as well like purposeful poisoning but in a time where the COVID virus is frantically about and the simplest way to deter it is to wash your hands, I do not want to support a location nor its employees that can not demonstrate proper hygiene and food handling skills to me.<//review>

Food is always fresh. We always get the delivery, never been here in person. Love how it's always nice and hot on delivery and always fresh. They've never been "too long" or something like that. We usually get several plates at a time and whoever my guest is, always is left with a delight.</review>

Our dealership is right across from Yerevan Steak House and our staff frequently eats here. Absolutely delicious, flavorful, and most importantly FRESH foods here. Never have been disappointed and the customer services has always been nothing short of excellent.

We always send our customers to this restaurant when they ask for a good lunch/dinner recommendation. Definitely worth having. Keep up the good work guys!< /review>

<text>Needs some work to improve. Service very slow, meat is a bit sweet and has too many ingredients in the chicken Lula Kebab, rice a little bit sticky and clumpy. Humus was good, overall ok bit with small changes can be much better in quality.<//text>< pictures>

I don't know if something change between now and when those last two reviews were written,  but I really like it. I had the lamb and chicken combo and it was good! The feel of the restaurant is a little different then what I think most people are used to. Feels like your stepping into someone's dinning room for a family dinner, and I found that to be a nice change. Its defiantly a family business and food is most definitely cooked fresh. I'm going to come back and wish I had discovered it sooner.</Text>

Although the food was good,  I think this place could offer additional Armenian dishes.  After all,  it is called Yerevan Steak House.  The service also needs an improvement.  It was slow, even though we were the only customers and no one checked up on us until the bill was due.  Next time I'd most likely order food to go.<//review>

Well, I was looking for a steakhouse, and they do in fact serve fillet mignon medallions, but this is really a lovely Armenian family restaurant. I had the Lala chicken and beef kebab with rice and salad and a wonderful hummus dip with pita bread. A fantastic meal for $13.95. I highly recommend!!< /Text>

<rate>5< /rate><review>This car wash is found right on the corner of the intersection. It is a pretty straightforward process where you pay at the entrance. There are a few wash options, but you score a great deal on Tuesday and Wednesday for only $4 for a supreme wash. Car vaeccum is free to use after the wash.<//review>< UserId.>

< review>
There was a funny looking girl with cheap glasses who refused to help my father pay at the kiosk. But she had no problem helping everyone else. When my father went back to talk to another employee working there he refused to give him the girl with a poor attitudes name and gave the number to call and leave a message. If you’re Hispanic turn the other way because they refuse to help out paying customers. Get employees who want to work there and help out customers with questions. Thanks<//review>

<Review>This car wash was very good before, for some reason they just drop the quality.
I got a car wash $12 to get my car nice and clean and after I washed the car looked like I was just passing trough the rain I asked the attendant if I can pass it again because I was expecting to have a better job for the money, and she says that doesn't matter if you paid the $5 dollar or $12 still same wash so pretty much is a scam!!
If you have to use this car wash don't pay more than $5 any way you don't going have a good car wash.
There's a lot of car wash on the same area with better service.<//Review>< Date>

<Text>$6 wash.
A six dollar wash, through a very thorough machine scrubbing compilation, to be exact.

It won't take off all the hard, sun pressed yellow bird poop stains, leaf sap, or mildews but that's what detailing is for. It's still a self serve style but without you washing your car.

This is better than a self serve by a long shot, and it's only $1 to $2 more (Express).
This includes a full car body air dry (a great one) no matter what wash option, along with free self serve vacuuming at any 20+ park stations within the lot.
This place gives me more time to detail my car rather than spending it on drying.
Almost all the park spots have canopies and keep you shaded from the son.
---
As a side note -- I visit weekly and because so, my washes get upgraded to higher tiers...I think by glitch. I've had five in the span of a year.

Thanks Wish Washy! Long time lover.<//Text>< GmapID>

Dont go here if your car has black trim! The water pressure is so high that it blasts off your black paint over the chrome trim, and the brushes are smashing against the car! Ill be getting an attorney to file a claim.< /Text>

What did I expect? They say it's Wishy Washy in the name. Paid $12 for their top-of-the-line automatic car wash. It literally did not change the way my vehicle looked. I tried speaking with an employee to discuss a refund and he acted like I was dumb. I've been to a million car washes and never have I seen such poor results. Just spend your $12 on a couple tall boys and look at your car from porch; it'll be more effective than going here.<//Text>

Worked very well when first opened. The vacuums don't always work. Sometimes they have very little suction (IF you're lucky to get one). They also just raise their prices.</Text>

<text>Never go to this place, the machine broke my side mirror, it's been a week and they never call back, I went to the place and the "manger" just said he can't do nothing that I have to wait until the office call me. The office in the place was close, I asked him when can I find the office open and he don't even know  the schedule of his OWN work's office. UNBELIEVABLE</text>< pics>

Horrible customer service ..their top wash left soap marks ..female attendant with no customer service skills who called her self a manager was rude and refused to give me a simple rewash ..also refused to provide me her name. Lost a long time customer. Petty employees can truly affect your place of business.< /text>

Terrible place to wash your car and not even worth it. You might as well go to a full car wash in pay eight bucks because that's the amount that you're going to be paying if you do it by hand at this place.<//Text>

I will try a different car wash.<//review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

<Review>their customer service literally sucks! you will find a bunch of scratches on your car after a single wash. after 3 or more washes, u will need to have your car polished because of the little scratches from their machines. Manager, Xavier, the lowest class manager i have ever seen.

One of the workers told me I have to go thru a wash if i have to vacuum my car, to which i responded that "my car is already clean, i only need to use the vacuum, which is free for me since I'm a member". so they did not let me vacuum the car, because this new worker said "you can't vacuum, if you don't wash".

I asked for the manager, explained the situation- no help. asked for e-mail contact to the higher management people or any other contact, - no help, just gave me the location phone number, where i can only call and talk to the same idiots. I asked to give me a copy of my contract, he did not. i asked for the name of the worker who told me i have to wash first, they didn't give it to me, manager told me  to identify him as "the black guy that just got hired", instead of giving me his name.

overall, NOT recommended at all.  go to another carwash even if you have to pay a little bit more.</Review></record></dataset><record>

6 days ago I visited this car wash. The man directing my tire into the little channel that travels the car along the car wash directed my tire in wrong. Today I wash my car at my house and find that myeft front tire has severe wear on the very left side. Now my car has a slanted jolting movement when I turn my tires. This car wash damaged my car. And now I have to buy a new tire and pay for a tire alignment. Horrible place. Go to hand car washes instead. And on an edited note, good luck trying to get ahold of their customer service via phone. NO ONE ANSWERES. Completely an unprofessional place.</Review>

$12.00 wash is a rip off! Car looks just as bad, as not being washed. I asked one of the employees,  if the $12.00 wash normally makes cars look worse and he pretty much ignored me. Not returning! Staff is unprofessional and wash is a total scam!</Text>

I was only going to vacuum my car they had me waiting for 30 minutes until everybody wash their car and there was a spot available. I think if you only need to vacuum your car and you have an account with them they should just let you vacuum it and you'll be out in 5 minutes. I cancelled my contract due to them being very rude and disrespectful and the manager he's very unprofessional I feel like I'm in the ghetto. I don't recommend anyone going to this Carwash. I'm not even wanting to spend time talking about the scratches on my car after their Carwash.< /text>

<Text>Their wash brushes broke my windshield whiper blade, and in the process of it breaking it cracked the windshield as well. And understandably things happen, however the manager here treated us as if we were lying and trying to pull a fast one. They offered to replace the blade and said that, "we have never had a window break before, so we're not gonna help you now." Things happen and what's right is right, and because of the managers fear of having to replace an inexpensive window and instead insinuating that we are liars and theives, this place gets a 1 star from me and loss of a returning customer. A seemingly cheap wash turned an expensive and aggrivating day.</Text>< pics>

< Review>
Shady business, with no accountability for their actions! My girlfriend pulled in, for a car wash, and their machine broke the rear wiper and passenger side mirror. When we tried to complain, they said that we had no proof of what had happened. We showed receipts of how much was paid, and the time we went through, and they still denied, and took no accountability, for the damages done. I wasn't looking for a big pay out, just something to fix the damages on her car...< /Review>

Escape room (detention): quite simple to solve, just the 1st lock is a bit tricky. Maybe thematic, but room decor is quite simple, no hidden rooms and very few (if any) fun props; mostly a series of combination locks with puzzles. Host doesn't monitor your progress (no cameras are set up), but you get a walkie-talkie. There are no usual warnings/explanations about not forcing stuff open, clues below eye level, etc.</review>

Chaos Central STAY AWAY
I have been to multiple parties at Laser Quest. My twins wanted a party there, so we decided to throw it there.
It was the worst experience for us and our guests, and sadly some of the guests felt so overwhelmed that they even left without spending any time. This is why?
1. Starting when we took the package we were not informed well about the differences in the party packages and the reasons we should pick one over the other. We should have picked a party with a host. The place is a MAD house, the acoustics of the site is BAD when they are making announcements you cannot hear.
2. When we got to the venue, no one knew what is happening? We did not have a place to keep our gifts, or food or stuff, it was weird to attend the guest and organize a locker and put our things in the fridge and figure out when people should come to get their kids and figure out what needs to be done with the kids or who is a kid in our party or not.
3. When we finally got a party room, it was so cramped. We were told that we would have a bigger party room as we were celebrating two kids it was super narrow room, with the hostess not showing up or serving or helping out.
4. They did not even spell our kid's name right!!
5. Lastly, there were closets in the room, and they were unlocked, so we kept our stuff and gifts in there only to know that they had 2 sided door and ultimately our gifts got mixed up with someone else
the hostesses told us we have 5 mins to leave without helping us pack, which increases confusion we could not correctly wish our guests goodbye.
Overall re-living the party through this review is giving me a headache. Save your dollars and find alternative party places. Pump it up is twice as much fun for kids and grown-ups.</Text>

<Text>Well organized, well designed, lots of fun. However, the lobby is loud (some sound absorption would help), and orientation area could be made quieter also. Good for birthday parties or just a group of friends. Reservations in advance is recommended.< /Text>< pictures>

Great equipment, friendly staff. Loved the detailed combat reports at the end. Could use a larger variety of game types like capture the flag or king of the hill - when you're just trying to get the most hits there's not a lot of room for strategy.< /Review>

<Review>Man, we had a lot of fun. I was with the team from Red Hot Chilli Pepper Restaurant, San Carlos. We were treated excellent from their staffs. They are very helpful. They stayed late for us, we were late because we had gone after work.
The place has two stories made out of wooden frames and has different structures to hide and seek which is a perfect space. We felt the reality on the game. we played two teams but with the individual scores.
I recommend this place for the anyone specially its good for large groups. I recommend you to call them and ask them for the help. They will organize as your group size.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

The arena is quite big and multi levels, so can accommodate fairly big groups (which is intense).  Unrelated to the game, pay attention to the parking which is a little non-obvious, but the staff will explain.<//text>

Bad. Bad setup where it was a zoo in the waiting area and kids' screaming echo extremely loudly from all concrete undercoated surfaces. The parents lounge is upstairs like a hospital waiting lounge. The video games makes fire alarm siren noises. You get the idea how this place is. We're here for a birthday party and we dropped the kids off a and walked to REI on the back to escape.<//Review>

<Review>Although the experience was excellent, and the three levels set up is amazing, the game was a bit flawed by wrong settings: you get hit, and after 3 seconds of invulnerability and disabled weapon you are able to shoot again. In other laser places you have a few seconds of invulnerability followed by a few seconds of vulnerability with your laser still disabled, which prevent the recurring situation in which somebody you shot stays there just to wait to shoot you back: if you win a duel, you should also win the right to be left alone, and if you lose a duel, you should leave at least for a few seconds.<//Review>< Pictures>

They're sending unsolicited email spam. I have never contacted them nor signed-up for any marketing - they must have bought my email address from someone else.</Review>

A game is 15 minutes long, but you will need mire time for take on and take out the equipment. The equipment is a little heavy for kids under 8 y.o. 15 min are intense and adultes instead of kids would found that enough!</review>

This was AWESOME found this through a kids birthday party. Inside is a MASSIVE maze of ramps and levels. One warning for parents my son is 4'3" into parkour and expressed his disappointment in the weight and bulk of the laser gear when loaded out. Gear is one size guessing to make targeting fair and equal. That's the only issue, the staff are great, the private party rooms great, they do special events, private and corporate. Into PUBG lol go enjoy gunning down friends and stranger's that you will probably become friends with by the end of the battle.<//Review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><date>1616028249018<//date><text>I love this Trader Joe's.  They have a large parking area that is helpful. They are still requiring masks to enter, and clean the carts between use.

That staff is friendly. The layout is pretty easy to follow. Best to go earlier to avoid crowds.

I like that some of the favorites are tagged in the frozen food section--which let's people know what customers really like.</text>< user_id>

The staff is cool usually. A person told me to step back as I was at the stop sign and not my cart. I thought he was a bit fastidious. After all, wasn't me?</Review>

I hate that I like this place.  They have a lot of things I like at good prices.  The atmosphere is pleasant and the employees are helpful and seem happy.  They also are open till 9:00 (previously till 10:00).

However, I gladly would pay a little more to patronize a local business that's not a foreign-owned chain.  To that end, I like to shop at Farmer Joe's, The Food Mill, House of Produce (a Cambodian grocery store in the Laurel district), and the Berkeley Bowl.  Nonetheless, I often wind up still going to TJ's for the convenience.</review>

This is a smaller location compared to other places I've been to.  There r two lines to pay.  The employees were very helpful.  In fact, I was already in line and waiting to pay when I stopped a petite male employee with black hair wearing a long sleeve turquoise shirt to ask if they still carried the chilled European chocolate pudding.   I already walked through the refrigerated section and didn't see it.  He told me to stay in line and he would go get the item for me.   Unfortunately, I didn't get his name, but wanted to give a shout out to his boss that he went out of his way to help a customer.  He definitely made my day!!  Additionally, I noticed a sign outside of the store that there will be a customer appreciation day on 6/21/20 w music, photo booth and giveaways and the store will be closed on July 4, 2020 in observance to Independence Day.<//Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMv06pyXvi35C7-z6BiKheQ1O6vi9hVZDlqV0dn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPhXakUNvX6QtVpYpr0XoHa0K1hi2d_3lPlpyyp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNXAoigq2eUZpOZJZ9raaE65tWNnb8nJKh4H4R7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNaX7GZ7-6FNQiKc_mN-PJMhAqOEidd2hvBFGTo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPyr2JJfyFvctY6kLMm5v7If18l7_7Gc-KlahRE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOCRDR5Mz-rpJczhJyV_5TO8DnGolz85BNSvHmw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< resp>

Good location, they always have what you need. Clean store and well stocked. Can be long lines but they move quickly. Employees should speak to customers, often feels like you have to be a member to feel welcome.<//review>

<Text>I love Trader Joes.  The food is so good and reasonably priced.  Whoever does their staffing also does a great job - everyone is super dedicated, friendly and knowledgable.  Right on!  Minus one star because there is always someone outside trying to sell me something.  Leave me alone lol<//Text>< user_id>

This place is very busy on the weekend also parking is challenging and you can circle looking for a spot best to go  through the week  To avoid the crowd~ long lines on the weekends as well... Can neverresist my favorite small crunchy oatmeal cookies perfect snack or wonderful with your coffee in the morning..  Came in to grab flowers for my open house.. they go have a nice selection of fresh flowers..< /text>

Rude heavy Asian guy directing traffic to check-out. Instead of directing and improving flow, he was basically talking to his coworkers and joking, not paying attention. Tried to ask him a question, he was quite rude. He needs to out of customer service.</review>

The store itself is fine, but Google's indication of how busy it is it l is totally off.  It shows as much less busy than normal (see picture) but there were 15 groups in line.  It did go fairly quickly, about 5 minutes, 6 at the most.  But just a heads up for those going if the picture</text>

Wait time was long to get into store.  But i appreciated the mask and social distancing requirements while waiting in line and while shopping in the store. Once you get into the store, you can shop and get checked out fairly quickly. Also appreciated the   carts being sanitized for the customers. Appreciate the hard work at helping us stay safe while shopping for our necessities.</text>

They are monitoring how many people are in the store at one time, and give you hand sanitizer when you are entering. The line moves pretty quickly, too.< /Text>

Although there was a long line, it moved very fast. Once inside I was offered hand sanitizer and a manicured cart. Everyone was pleasant and very helpful. Tim was my cashier. He was a happy cashier (I like happy 😁) with 💣 customer service, askin'  "would you like, and did you find" questions. BIG UPS to Tim 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾</text>

<review>Always friendly warm welcoming stores always clean weather constantly restocking and you have to make your way around boxes and large karts removing large boxes. The staff is very accommodating when this is the issue. Sometimes you just don't want to see boxes or say excuse me five times. Small price to pay as the prices here seem to be much more reasonable than the average grocery store in the area. So I will continue to use this establishment as a source of place to purchase nursing items for my home<//review>< pics>

Lakeshore Oakland Trader Joes is doing an amazing job during Covid. They line up people in the shade despite the inconvenience to cars and forklifts, they offer water, they spray you with hand sanitizer on the way in, and they enforce their policies fairly and politely. They are honestly better to shop at during Covid than regular times, shows how well this staff has stepped up. Truly appreciate my local TJ's....</review>

Always great, friendly service, often get into pleasant conversations with the workers, and it feels like they don't hate their jobs or the company and  that makes a difference. Less expensive than perceived, you can get quite a bit of food (especially produce) for pretty cheap here. Lots of yummy exclusive products and treats here.< /Text>

Good folks who work at this TJ's. Well stocked and they're doing their best to keep the place clean and us safe during COVID. But...its still too crowded inside - they need to slow the rate of people they let in. It was like a traffic jam inside. Shoulder to shoulder through half the store. I did NOT feel safe.<//review>

Biggest Trader Joe's store I have ever been!
Greater variety of products (at honest prices) than the store I usually shop. Parking is a little challenging since there are many other shops in the area.</Review>

<review>It's just what you expect from Trader Joe's. You either get, or you don't. I have particular items I go there to purchase and rarely ever can't find them. Plumcots are a thing, check them out this Summer.< /review>< Date>

Store is nice inside, staff is always friendly, but I hate this parking lot with a seething passion. I have nightmares about this parking lot. I can feel the cortisol gushing through my veins just writing about this God forsaken apocalyptic gridlock of a parking lot.< /text>

<text>It's a Trader Joe's: tasty food, excellent prices, well organized, and friendly staff. This one in Oakland is usually busy, and during peak hours the parking lot is usually full.

< Review>
So it's a pretty standard trader Joe's inside, if you've been to one you've pretty much been to them all. I will say the layout of this one is a bit less optimal than some others.
That said this is one of the busiest locations in the area, if you go during peak hours you will regret it. Parking is also an unmitigated disaster. I've never had a parking lot where people are as cut throat as here, you'll routinely have to trawl for parking for 10mins only to have some one veer down the wrong way and swipe your spot.<//Review>

< review>
Have been a TJ shopper literally across the country for over a decade.   It seems everytime that I take a break and return their offerings are less and less and the prices increase more and more.  This store looked like it had been raided as the shelves aside from the liquor and booze aisles were extremely barren and they were "out" of basic items like LENTILS.  Seriously?!?!  Most of the fresh fruit and juice prices are highway robbery.  TJs used to be about offering healthy inexpensive produce and options, but they seem to be about profit profit profit and as few options for the customer as possible.  Maybe they should just become a Liquor and frozen foodstore as that seems to be their focus,  at least from the looks of this store.  Extremely disappointing.< /review>

Trader Joe's is always a great place to shop but they use too much plastic to wrap their foods!! Considering how socially conscious they are, the expectation is that now their packaging/presentation of their  foods should reflect this.< /Text>

I went this morning at 9 and was surprised at how many shoppers there were in the store. No line just a lot of people inside. The employees are getting a little bossy about which line you're in and where you're standing. I thought it slightly impolite.< /Text>

Love this Trader Joes! Lots of great varieties of items, and definitely sells organic local produce at a fraction of the other spots (Whole Foods, etc). Strongly recommend this place, and don't forget their peanut butter pretzels + chocolate peanut butter pretzels!< /Review>

I had a really nice checker this evening at this store.  He made a joke when I dropped something.  He pointed out that something I was buying was smushed, which I had not noticed, and let me go get another one.  When I asked for a double bag, he had one ready and moved items from the single bag to the double bag.  A very nice  and helpful young man!<//text>

The parking lot does get crowded sometimes, but usually there is additional parking on the roof of the parking structure. The checkout lines move very quickly at this branch, so if you see a long line, don't be discouraged;  it moves quickly! Also, the staff here is very friendly, but that's usually true for most Trader Joe's stores.</Review><Pics>None</Pics><time>1533833189728</time>< user_id>

Nice store layout.  As always friendly and fast with the best wraps and sandwiches.  The mini frozen croissants, ruse over night and taste like perfect fresh bakery.
The Charles Shaw wine is still there (and my father's name).  Always find low prices frozen dumpings with the best doing Sauce.  Don't forget the cheese selection and flowers.< /Review>

<Text>Trader Joe's is quite busy. Great food at fair prices. The checkers get you threw the line in short time. Friendly staff and specialty items makes this store a favorite of mine. There is plenty of other stores in walking distance and great restaurants too. One of the best pet supply store is near by and Merritt lake is near by.< /Text><UserId.>104629857835366627450< /UserId.><Pics>None< /Pics><GmapID>0x808f874191610697:0xd7eecd61759ad680< /GmapID><date>1516394664283< /date>< Rate>

<Text>I love this Trader Joe's for staff, quality and prices, but parking at this popular TJ's is stressful unless you live a charmed life or can figure out when the parking lot is not crowded. It is much easier to park at other TJ's. Pay to park elsewhere and WALK.<//Text>< Pics>

The only downside to this location is the amount of people who shop here.  I feel like we could have one more Traders within a mile and everyone would be happy.  The staff are hard workers who make the long lines go by quickly.  The parking lot is always full so be prepared to wait, bring your patience hat!  Definitely worth the wait though.< /text>

Nice place to stop on the way home for groceries. Great produce and pre made lunches. Specialty items. Great service. Parking is a bit cramped but hey at least there is free parking.

The new hours are horrible! 9pm closing is too early for those of us that work late hours . .<//Review>

Good selection and a nice variety of things to spark culinary curiosity. Their social Islam sausage is surprisingly good. Love the wasabi chips and flat breads as well. Their alcohol selection is pretty decent short of going to a liquor store. Overall a good one stop shop.< /Text>

<Text>Best case scenario is if somebody drives you to this TJ's. This is Lakeshore, folks, the parking situation is going to be an incalculable nightmare. If it's not too out of your way, I'd recommend going to the TJ's in Castro Valley.</Text>< pics>

The food, the prices and the employees here are awesome. I love coming here to shop and although their checkout system needs updating, i love their products. On the other hand, the parking situation is a nightmare which is out of their control but still affects us shoppers. Try their dark chocolate truffle bar located near the checkout stands. Super yummy!!!</Text>

The produce section is relatively small and it's very hard to push a cart around because it's such a busy store as well. The employees seem to be really nice and helpful, but sometimes they also seem to just be standing around and talking amongst themselves. I like that they have some vegan items, especially under the Trader Joe's brand, but it would honestly be nice to see more of a variety of vegan options in the future. Parking can be an issue since the parking lot is relatively small and it's just as busy as the store.<//review>

I love Trader Joe's. I was able to find everything I needed. Would have given 5 stars but the cashier assisting me was aloof. He didn't speak, never have me any contact and I asked him a question and she just responded by doing what I asked without  acknowledging what I said. He bagged my items and was looking somewhere else as I grabbed bag. I had to pull my own receipt from the register because he never grabbed it.<//review>

I also love how friendly and accommodating the staff is at Trader Joe's and how positive an atmosphere one can find at this particular location. My only complaint is the poor parking.

< Review>
Let me start by saying that I usually like going to this TJ's. It's got a great setup for checkout only two lines to choose - one is for hand-basket folks only, and usually feeds 2-4 registers. The other line is mostly for people with shopping carts (but open to everyone) and feeds all the other registers. No need to try to guess which line is quickest, just queue up.

That being said, on a Sunday evening, most of the store is completely picked over and not restocked. They were out of at least three items today, that I usually get there, and it just makes for a wasted trip. One other caveat: the berry section has really gone downhill. No organic strawberries for a long time now, and the last batch of raspberries molded in just one day. That's a quality issue that they need to sort out.

Aside from that, the options are usually good, along with the prices, but FFS, just keep everything stocked.<//Review>

<Pics>None< /Pics><Review>So happy to have a TJs in the area. I am from the west coast and love Trader Joes because of their selection of goods. Its great for certain items. I wish that the packaging on some of their items wasn't so excessive but I do love the value for the quality of goods. And the eclectic style. They also have great deals on liquor if they are allowed to sell it, which varies according to state laws.< /Review>< username>

Love it but the parking bites. Really great location otherwise, pretty nice size, staff is always helpful. Only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is the parking. It's hecka hard to find a spot and a bear to get in or out. Try to come at off times--avoid middle of day on weekends and right after work on weekdays.<//text>

<review>This TJ's location is a bit difficult to get in and out of. Make sure you have a lot of patience when going into that parking lot. The store is small -- narrow but long.

<review>Parking lot is crazy here. Inside, the store is decently spacious (besides the checkout area), and is well-stocked. There is often a long line (its been wrapped around the entirety of the on occasion!) at the check-out, but they do a great job moving it along quickly. Unfortunately, I can't let the abysmal parking situation here off the hook, even if the rest is fine. I would avoid this location.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

It used to be my favorite grocery store, however, the parking is horrible and it's always busy. The area used to be very diverse until it was not. It feels like Oakland is losing its essence.</Text>

Parking can be unpleasant at times. Very small store. Twice it did not have what I went for, Atkins ranch lamb and bread flour. Staff has always been helpful. Lines move at a reasonable pace.< /review>

Single line for checkout works very well: moves fast, no choosing a line and then getting stuck behind somebody who is having problems, etc. Even line that winds all the way around store is fast moving and managers help at that point.
Service generally very helpful and return policy excellent.
Parking on roof always available when I need it.
Way better than other supermarkets for my needs.</Text>

<pictures>None</pictures><resp>None<//resp><Review>Good overall experience, but tends to be constantly busy and hard to find parking in the parking lot due to the high number of patrons to the local shops in the area. The lines tend to be long but move relatively fast but sometimes can take up to 15 min.

Staff is always friendly and helpful,especially when it gets packed. Like any other grocery store, I'd recommend getting here early before the good produce runs out. They have run out of things on a Sat night or a Sunday right before closing.<//text>

Trader Joe's is the perfect place to venture into especially if you are a vegetarian. One of my favorites is the vegan ground beef, it looks like, and has the aroma of beef, but it is vegetable based.<//text>

<Review>Came in late at night to see the process for restocking the shelves, and appreciated that even though there were a bunch of people doing some serious work, the employees were courteous and made sure you could get around them and find what you need.  In other grocery stores, I'm used to seeing this and having pallets/end caps block the path, or employees not willing to stop what they are doing to let you get what you need.<//Review><Resp>None</Resp>< pictures>

<Rating>2</Rating><Review>TJ'S vary according to location both in terms of availability of product (Lakeshore is often out of basics - today, they were out of the only Lactose free milk they now carry -their own brand) and strawberries  (which, I believe are now in season) - and quality: generally, Alameda's produce section is better tended- (less wilt or rot). And then, there is a kind of blind sided variety of some products- 20 types of hummus on the shelf, but no tahini. Go figure.</Review>< pics>

Decent size store, however the parking situation and the lack of selection due to out of stocks is highly frustrating. Nice staff and if you catch this store at just the right time you'll have a good experience. Problem is, you just never know when that's going to be.</Review>

< Review>
It's a run of the mill TJs. Can get crowded at random times but lines move mostly quickly. I've never driven here so haven't had to park. The lot in front of the store very often gets snarled with cars coming and going and waiting. Head directly into the adjacent parking structure to minimize parking stress.<//Review>

What do you say about a Trader Joe's?
This one has decent parking in a difficult parking shopping area.  They do have a single line for checkouts, which is a blessing, and another single line for clients with only baskets.  Getting in and out is painless.

Why only 3 stars?  Normal TJ's problems.  So-so produce, (very) rude fellow customers, stocking staff that treats the customers as if we are annoyingly in their way. The mad rush, etc.< /Text>

Super quick line, even when the string of people wraps around to the very back of the store and coils back towards the dairy aisle. I've seen the store with a dozen cashiers, all cheery and waving people along, so applause for the single line system.

Maybe a tad smaller than other TJ stores, but it has always had everything I'm looking for.

Can get crowded right after 5 pm on weekdays!< /Text>

Many trader joes I've been to have a line for every check stand, which is absolute chaos... This location has a single long line feeding into a large checkout area which is much more fair and efficient in my opinion.<//review>

<Review>The cashier I had was Super Kind! He thought my sample was garbage offered to throw it away and I said oh no no no haven't eaten it yet and he was just so polite and he also welcomed me back saying okay I'll see you in a few hours which I thought was so cool I mean just really nice had a wonderful shopping experience I wish I could find my receipt to give his name I know it was registered 5 at 10:30ish. Super Great Empoyees. Down to the sweet lady that said may she check the restroom really quick to ensure it was stocked and she checked and came right out and said go ahead and then I will bring more supplies right after so polite. 💓💜💚💔💛💙😸</Review>< pictures>

To make  matters  worse  the so called  shift  manager is not even  courteous  at all to suggest  any  sort of  suggestions  or replacement.  All you  left  with  is a rude face,  just  to  keep  you  wondering  what happened  to  that  trader  Joe's  that  brought  a smile  on  your  face.  When they  first opened  their  first  shop  in Oakland. I think  the regional  manager  need  to  train some  of  these  people  better.  There  a reason  why we come  to  trader Joe's,  we value  the brand and credibility. May  it's time  to weed out.< /review>< Pics>

I adopted this Trader Joe's as my weekly grocery place about 2 years ago.   I go at different times each week, because I have a nontraditional work schedule.  I have never needed to wait more than 10 minutes in line, nor failed to get cheerful service!<//text>

Though it isn't the largest TJ's, it is my favorite. They have a sh*tload of registers so even when the line is super long they get you in and out quickly. The guys who work there are super cute too.<//Text>

Honestly, one of the least pleasant shopping experiences shopping at TJs... always packed, always with workers pushing massive carts to put-away-items, at all hours of the day, cluttering up the already crowded isles. The worst part though, has to be the weirdest and least logical cashier spaces, with barely any room to bag your groceries, and barely any room not to bump the person next to you who is trying to fit-in or get out of the check-out area. MIserable.< /review>

It's often too crowded and has a thoughtless floor design.

Update 10/12/19:  they've recently revised the floor plan, moved cold case items into a new cold case at the rear of the store, making the shopping experience more spacious and "logical".  Often still crowded (especially around the end/first of the month, it's not as frantic as it was before these changes. Relief.  Upgrading to 4 stars.  Getting into, out of and around the parking lot (lower level) remains ridiculous.  Save yourself some grief and just head to the upper level after entering from the back side of the shopping center.  Makes it easier to get out, too.< /text>

<rate>2</rate><Review>Now normally this is a Trader Joe's that has very good customer service. However yesterday I experienced subpar customer service from several employees.
Asking for the Trader Joe's brand of ginger ale, I received blank stares. And when I asked again if they could find the Trader Joe's brand of ginger ale they seemed peeved and not happy and very apathetic.
One employee did go finally go and get the Reeds brand which clearly was not what I asked for, and when they gave it to me they behaved as if I was an absolute lunatic that I could not find this soda on my own.
I said "No this is the Reeds brand not the Trader Joe's brand".
The employees both looked at me as if I was some kind of weirdo asking for something really unreasonable.
I do not think that this was unreasonable to ask for the Trader Joe's brand in a Trader Joe's.
Call me crazy, but it seems like Trader Joe's employees should know that Trader Joe's has there own products and should be able to find them for customers without being snotty and apathetic.<//Review>< pics>

Can't go wrong with TJ's. They run out of stuff sometimes and I've seen the line wrap almost all the way to the front door here. Definitely not a place to come get something quick; this Trader Joe's takes some time. The line, although it may look daunting, moves pretty quickly most of the time. The staff is pretty friendly and you can't go wrong with free samples!</text>

Trader Joes is great as always, but this location is the busiest I have ever seen and I was there before peak hours. If there is another Trader Joes on your route consider shopping there.</Review>

Parking is a pain although it has a underground parking. The store is always crowded but the prices are reasonable compared to Wholefoods. Overall, I like Trader Joe, there are items that you cannot find anywhere else.</text>

< review>
I have many nice things to say about Trader Joe's in general, and about this particular location specifically.

It's the thin-and-long store layout, with windows at the front, which lends a bit of a darker feel than the Emeryville or Alameda locations. It's not a terrible thing: the thinner store makes it seem like I have to take less steps to get my shopping done.

Trader Joe's is very keto-friendly. My favorites are their meat selections, from the sirloin steak to the grass-fed zero-carb hot dogs, the truffle pate, and the Volpi sopressata salami. There's also the riced cauliflower, grilled artichoke hearts, their coffee selection, and the coconut coffee creamer.

This location is well-stocked, well-managed, with a lot of registers and a good flow.<//review>

It's always too busy, parking lot a mess, but there is a garage. Great products, of course. That's TJ's! Today was a bad shopping experience though... Check out service lady was noticeably unfriendly & a bit rude. First time in years I actually went to management, he didn't seem to care or listen for that matter. I miss the friendly helpful staff I'm used to at every other Trader Joes I've ever been.  3stars is generous.</Text>

Parking is awful, they are always packed and usually out of an item I'm shopping for. Great for Trader Joes! :)< /Review>

If this store, had better parking facilities, more store space, it would be one of the best Trader Joe's in
Northern California.  That being said, it still does not take away from the shopping experience. The
staff is one of the best, most friendly, any company could hope to have. Efficiency and speed, matter
but, at the end of the day, it is how one as a customer is treated, is what counts the most at least,
in my opinion. A customer, should always leave a store, feeling better then when they went in.
I don't live too close to this store but, once in a while I do shop there. The last time, I was in the store
was two days ago. It was busy but was not too busy, to enjoy shopping. (irony to this, for a store to do well, it needs to be busy, to be successful). At any rate, I met two employees that just made my evening. Any company, would be lucky to have them. Unfortunately, even though
I asked for her name, I have forgotten it (to my dismay). She was amazing. Her name, may be Linda,
She would remember me, I think. She actually approached me in the bread department, to ask if I needed help (I must have looked, as if I needed it). She was just great, She recommended a dessert
(zucchini bread) that was terrific. The other employee I want to mention, is Tevin. Tevin, was fast,
upbeat (clearly loves his job) and courteous. I did leave the store, feeling better then when I walked in.
What shopping experience, could beat that. Before concluding, store well supplied and stocked well.
Trader Joe's at Lakeshore Ave, Oakland, is carrying the high standards, that first made it so well known and popular.</text>

They changed the check out counters to remove the space to pack groceries. Now very frustrating to pack groceries either on the floor or kind of in the tiny space by the POS device. Too bad, because they do have good frozen foods.< /review>

Like other Trader Joe's, great variety of products, but not overwhelming, so you can get in & out quickly. A parking lot adjacent so you can find parking.< /Review>

<Text>It’s a grocery store, a Trader Joe’s, nothing special in particular. The reason a star gets docked is because that parking lot is a DISASTER. Very hard to have a call shopping trip if you go there during any peak hours, and you can easily get trapped behind a line of cars waiting for other people to load up their car, return their cart, get in the car (why do some people take so long to get into a car?!?!?), start the car, back out (which now the car waiting to take their spot is blocking them in and has to back up the entire line), to finally take the spot.

Basically, if you have to go to Trader Joe’s, take the bus.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>
