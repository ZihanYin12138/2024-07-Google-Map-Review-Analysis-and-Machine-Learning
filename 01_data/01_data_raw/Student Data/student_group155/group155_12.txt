< Review>
I Got accepted for a rental property and was asked to put down a deposit without even seeing the property. I asked to see the property first and arrangements were made. I brought my girlfriend along and we viewed the property. The next day I followed up and they were concerned that my girlfriend did not submit an application. She had no plans to move in but she submitted an app anyway. The following week I received an email saying I was declined. I responded that I had already been approved and that I didn't see any reason that should change. They responded that the denial was based on my co-applicants credit. I explained that she has better credit than I do, as our documents show. Did not hear back. The only explanation I can think of is that my girlfriend is a latin immigrant, and the homeowner-who we met and who screens the applications _did not like this fact. Upset but glad I didn't sign the lease</Review>

We have 3yrs rent in savings and are unemployed on unemployment benefits. Wife gets deployed in August.. theres absolutely no refunds on applications. Basically it's not an equal opportunity renting property. I think they pick the best people while worthy applicants suffer. They don't care about there community. Do not rent from these people.< /review><Gmap_id>0x809ae6d321497795:0x4483e9b3b9fd83bb< /Gmap_id>< Name>

<review>I am a property owner and tried to handle renting myself, after a few weeks of trying to find tenants, I knew I needed help. I was referred to Cornette from my Realtor Ronnie Sylvia, and they have been amazing. Elena started with a phone call where she broke down their pricing but also just gave me advice if I wanted to keep trying on my own. After giving up, they came in and took over, Elena and her team were flexible with my needs, extremely communicative and their professional expertise has been invaluable. I know have tenants at a higher monthly rate than I was asking for myself. If you are considering switching to a property manager definitely use Cornette and ask for Elena!< /review>< pics>

We have been using Cornette PM for over 2 years now for managing our property. We switched over from another company after I researched 2 other companies together with Cornette. Someone in my neighborhood also  recommended them.

We needed a company that would look after our property with our (owner) interests at heart. We found that with Cornette.  They have also done really well in answering my questions before they started managing our property and even now are always very responsive.   All in all they provide good value for money too.</review>

I rented with Cornette for almost a total of 5 years. I rented 3 different properties from them. Each time the staff has always been friendly and always eager to help in any way they can.

Ericka has always been so helpful and informational whenever I had issues.

I moved out of my most recent rental house in March and there were some issues in regards to the deposit and some damages within the unit. I emailed Cornette and spoke with Monica, who was very friendly. I shared with her my concerns and she was able to speak with the owner of the property and we were able to come to an agreement on charges.

Ericka, Monica, and the rest of the staff are great and I highly recommend them to anyone who is looking to rent in the Sacramento area.</text>

< Review>
I am beyond disgusted with my experience with this company. It has wasted about a month trying to get approved. One thing after the other. I constantly had to call/ harrass to see if they were doing anything about processing my application. 3 almost 4 weeks have gone by and now there is an issue with my income. I absolutely make enough money at my hair salon to cover 3+ times the rent even on a bad week but they will not accept commission based salaries, bonuses, miscellaneous pay, tips, retail commissions, or any other type of pay that is not by the hour because it is not guaranteed income. What kind of logic is that. Hours are not guaranteed now a days either. I feel like she could have told me this in the beginning. Save yourself a headache and look elsewhere.  I really feel bad for the homeowners that are paying them to rent their homes. I could have paid a years worth of rent up front.< /Review>

This management company is awful. Me and my husband applied to 1 house. On their website they have a link you can go to, to see if there are any pending applications. On the one we were applying to there were not any pending applicants. So we applied and paid the fee. They also ask a question on your application if there are any other properties your interested in. There were so we listed them incase our application didn't go through on the first. Btw the other 2 houses we put on our applications also didn't have any pending applications.

They email me back and say the property we applied for had been rented, our second preference didn't allow pets, and our third preferencethey were waiting on a deposit. Confused and irritated because they had misinformation on their website I emailed them. I asked for a refund and told them they needed to update their website.

I got an email back saying they take in 10 applications per listing and let the owner choose (they dont say that on their webaite though) and they won't refund us. The application fees are 40 dollars. They basically rob you of your money. 120 dollars they robbed me and my family during a pandemic.... This management company is a joke. I'd give it no stars if I could. Awful and greedy people.</Text>

I recently went through the processes of renting a house. We applied for a house through Cornette Property Management, $40 per application.  They requested information that was not pertinent (6 months of mortgage statements for a house we did not own!) I informed them of this and they closed our application and refused to give us a refund! Across the board property companies have refunded our fee when they didn't complete the application, however Cornette has refused this courtesy and they were the ones that canceled our application! I believe this is unfair given the circumstances. Amid the pandemic $80 is a lot of money.
Do not use Cornette they are unfair!<//text>

TLDR; Don't waste your time and money on this company.

On 10/6/20 I came across a listing for a studio apartment which would not be available until 11/20/20. By 10/11/20 I had not heard back from Cornette Property Management. There weren't any pictures of the interior but since I knew a previous resident, I was confident I wanted to live at this property and applied through the website. On 10/15/20 I heard back from a "Credit Manager", Sarah, who informed me I'd need a co-signer since I had previously rented from a family member (they just saw the same last name, didn't know who the family member or what the situation was) and had only been at my current job for 4 months. I have been through the probationary period in my role and have even been promoted. They did not ask about the details of this nor about my previous job history. If they had, they'd have learned that I had worked in property management for a National company and am very familiar with the policies and procedures in regards to Fair Housing. When I responded offering more rental references and offered an explanation in employment, it took "Credit Manager", Kaitlyn, four days to let me know my application had gone inactive despite the fact that I had responded to the last email immediately.

The lack of communication and ridiculous policies that are not fluent throughout the industry not only caused me to take a hit on my credit and throw away $40, but realize that the reviews (online and from previous residents at multiple properties I've spoken with) are true and that Cornette Property Management is not a company I will ever rent from or recommend. I'm honestly glad I found out now as opposed to after signing a contract.<//text>

Its been over two weeks since i engaged with this company.
During the difficult times, they have provided with the worst service possible. I have followed up with any request for perspective tenants on properties listed and decided to pay along and provide them with all that they asked in the process.
They are not big on communication and may let an email or attachment completely be skipped altogether.

They have charged me for the application fee and have stopped responding, the issue is i have good credit score, good rental history record, and an job that can easily substantiate the rent amount.

Now I’m left to wonder, wether i was racially profiled as there is no explanation nor answer from management, and i will pursue legally into this matter.

So thank you for nothing!!

As for my recommend, take your business elsewhere.< /review>

When I immediately got back to them explaining that everything was done, they ghosted us for days. I called and emailed them and it took days to get back to me.  In the meantime,  I noticed the rental was no longer available.  When they finally got back to me, I was never told they rented the home to someone else until I brought it up!

This was a very interesting experience. Applying for an apartment and working with the applicable department for a few weeks I have an understanding and message I would like to pass on. This company is very questionable! After non-professional emails and unprofessional reaction from staff members. I would really make sure this is an area you want to be leaving/rent in. Because of COVID-19 this area a little different I understand that. But rude and not professional seems to not be a good trade-off. after getting denied for an apartment that I was clearly qualified for I'm not going to get into the details. I moved my application over to an office For my company. before applying for the initial apartment all of my concerns and the fact that I wanted more than one property were brought up to. being the fact that my application went through so many people's hands and the conversation or notes did not go along with the application I feel like they were under the wrong consumption and I was asked if I'm going to live in the office building with my children and I felt like that was very disrespectful and it would not have happened if I was not African American. I will say in the end I did get approved for the also receive a phone call from management trying to smooth things over. I feel like the only reason I did get approved is because of the scrutiny that was put on the situation. Also, my credentials were legit and it's no way that they could deny me. So I would say make sure you come completely correct documents checks stubs anything you need to proceed to the next level with this company because they have no personality and it's all documentation. Also, I did receive cards for food. I felt like that was a really nice finishing touch and I do appreciate that.</Review>

We would never want our applicants to feel that we are discriminating against them in any way.  Again, I do apologize if we made you feel that way.  During the process of your application, I was not informed that you might also be interested in a commercial property and a residential property.  In the past I have received transfer requests from applications from residential property to commercial properties.   Once I Notify them that this is a commercial property, they typically let me know that they were not aware and end up transferring their application over to another residential property. If I was aware you also had a business and were looking for a commercial property, I would not have notified you that the property you were trying to transfer your application over to was a commercial property.  It was not until after you put in the transfer request that you sent over documentation showing your business. I understand where the miscommunication was and, in the future, we will be handling this situation differently if it comes up again. Thank you for bringing this concern to my attention.\n\nThank you,\n\nApplication Department'}< /response><gmapID>0x809ae6d321497795:0x4483e9b3b9fd83bb< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Very disappointed in Cornette Property Management as a business. I applied to rent a house for me and my husband. Both my husband and I were required to submit separate applications.  I submitted my application with the application fee of $40 and within 3 hours, was told the application was rejected because another tenant's application was chosen. My husband had not had the chance to submit his apart of the application before I was told this.  When I requested a refund (because our applications could not have been considered before they were rejected as he had not completed his application yet) I was denied.

I advise the public not to submit applications where a fee is required. In this case, my application was clearly not considered even though I paid $40. Application scam.<//review>

How do you think they are still in business with so many unhappy customers 🤔

Go to Reality Round up before you waste any money with this company.

Discriminatory!!
Does not really have fair housing business practices.

It's true in the reviews.

Please please please, do not rent from these people!!!!!. We were vulnerable enough to say, "not all ratings mean they are bad" F that!!!! We had mold in our house and they never contacted us, then for the deposit they charged us for dumb stuff like a screen aerator. When we got the house it was destroyed and smelled like human pee!! Not only that, but when we cleaned the house there were shooter bottles everywhere!! There was a wasp nest in the back yard.When I'd call the office there was some rude lady who would answer the phone like it was her house and always had a bad attitude. I'd give them 0 stars but I can't. I'm just so glad to be out of there.</review>

{'time': 1598039499142, 'text': 'Hello Lyza,\n\nYou created a work order on 2/11/2020 “ we believe there is mold in the house”. The maintenance department attempted to get a hold of the tenants and ask if anyone has cleaned it with the 50% bleach and 50% water solution. No one reached back out to us. However, on 3/2/2020 you had your annual inspection. Our inspector reported mildew in a closet. We reached out via email with the same information as before. Your roommate then replied saying she has cleaned it and it has not  come back. We then closed the work order since she confirmed the situation was handled.\n\nRegarding your deposit, we do compare your move in inspection with your move out inspection. Anything that is reported on the move out that was not reported on the move in inspection does get charged back to you once the work is completed. Unfortunately there were a few items we had to charge back to you. You did dispute the charges, however after the owner reviewed your email with the inspections,  and stated charges to remain.\n\nLastly, as a new tenant we do give you the opportunity to add to your move in inspection. We typically give you 1-2 weeks to add. After reviewing your tenant documents, work orders, emails and text messages nothing was ever reported.\n\nMonica'}</Resp>

We rented a home and had an overall positive experience with Cornette. They were quick to respond to questions/requests, although sometimes we had to ask multiple times for repairs that weren’t urgent. Their payment site is easy to use and convenient. I thought our move out process would be a nightmare with the horror stories you hear about people being taken for their deposits, but Cornette was very organized, detailed, thorough in their inspection and I thought extremely fair in their deposit refund. I didn’t feel like they had “cheated me” in any way. We rented from them for almost 10 years and overall, a good experience. Thanks Cornette!</text>

My experience with Cornette has been one of dehumanization, unhelpfulness to the point of neglect, and of very blatant incompetence.
There were two instances where I called to ask about something that was stated on their website, the first time I called to ask about needing a photocopy of your social security card, and in that phone call asked if anything else hadn’t been updated and I was told that no everything else was up to date, I called back a second time because I didn’t have my cats shot records, I was then told I didn’t need them.
Their customer service is non-existent, and they do not listen when asked questions, instead, they merely regurgitate information at you rather than trying to understand your situation and attempt to help you. I and my two partners are trying to move from out of state and it has been on the whole very frustrating and stressful, Cornette did nothing to try and help mitigate the stressfulness of our situation instead they exacerbated it to a very high degree.
If you can and customer service is important to you I recommend dealing with someone else.
They were asked multiple times either through email or over the phone very specific questions and instead of
listening the just regurgitated information I already knew or sent back a copy-pasted email.
I and my family tried to be upfront as we could think to be and we were not shown the same courtesy.
If I could give it a negative star review I would. I can’t help but draw a parallel that they willfully took our money knowing that we wouldn’t qualify.</Review>

As a tenant, I had only one problem with the property, their response was fast and the company they used for the service was excellent. When I moved out of the property I left everything the way it was when I moved in, got my complete deposit in only a week.< /Text>

<review>The worst renting process/experience of my life.
I applied for 6 homes with denial for all of them and here are my qualifications:
1. 800+ credit score
2. Annual income over $150k
3. 0 evictions ever
4. 8-year consistent work history

There clearly is racism baked into the home decision process. My son, wife and myself were sad for days knowing this racist system still exist in California.
😥
. The owner of the business says " the homeowners simply chose someone else six times". Well that's exactly the racism I'm referring to. You have a process where someone who has exceptional credit, income, and background can get discriminated against simply due to race. They can simply search our name on the application and see what race we are.< /review><rate>1< /rate>< resp>
{'time': 1582389033116, 'text': 'Hi Emmanuel,\n\nAs per our phone conversation. You were never denied with the company, the homeowners simply selected different applicants. Unfortunately the properties that you applied for were all in the same general area, price range and quite similar – When you wanted to transfer your application, many times we had other qualified applicants in the same situation as you and transferred over their applications as well.  I let you know that you could transfer over your application to any of our available properties, look on the website actively and let us know right away. We abide by all Fair Housing Laws.

<Text>After applying for several houses through this company it seemed like we had a very difficult time, curious I checked the reviews and it seems like a lot of others have too. Would not recommend working with them and even bothering with the application fees. I’m sad I gave them my money.

We do require all applicants to provide the most recent pay stub from your employer. It took your co-applicant several days to obtain the correct documentation that we needed to verify income.  During this process, our department was in contact with you daily via phone and email.

We have had the ABSOLUTE WORST experience trying to rent a house through Cornette. Not only did they ask for an absurd and unnecessary amount of financial and personal information (including our first born child and blood type), they denied us on zero grounds which is arguably discrimination on their part. I don’t recommend this property management company for anything but a headache and an insane amount of frustration.<//text>

Your application was not denied on zero grounds and we do follow all Fair Housing Laws during the process of the application.  Your application was denied by the Homeowner due to credit blemishes.

During the process of your application we also found that you have a dog that was not listed on the application.  We then had to ask for more documentation that was not provided when you first applied.  Again, this will delay the process.  After your application was completed and reviewed the first time, unfortunately your income was not three times the rental rate for this property and was denied on income.  At that time, you were able to apply with a co-signer.  Once your co-singer submitted the application, we processed their part of the application and presented everything over to the Homeowner for final decision.

As a landlord my experience with Cornette has been excellent in many respects. I have had the displeasure of living through a gamut of issues with my properties and Cornette has always delivered in a professional and timely fashion to help solve those issues. A property management company's job is precisely to alleviate the stress of managing rentals and Cornette delivers in spades with experience and courtesy.

Maintenance issues are dealt with swiftly, with intelligence (and even good humor!) by Monica. She is able to narrow down the problem and call up on just the right amount of professional help to take care of multiple problems economically and in one trip. Monica's vendor selection I found to be excellent and they provide professional work at competitive rates so much so that I don't bother shopping around anymore.

April, the turnover specialist, helped me *completely* renovate a unit that was utterly trashed in just three weeks flat, ahead of schedule AND under budget with change to spare for a few nice upgrades... April even helped me solve some issues by quickly taking the initiative on some decisions with paint and flooring which made my life happy. Thank you!

Jessica was invaluable in navigating the always tricky decisions of rent increase, market pricing and regulation regarding rent increase caps. Jessica is also a great resource for some quick rental market analysis and comps. Emily who works with Jessica helped me track down a tenant who did not make full rent payments and while I dread receiving a late payment notice I am confident they are on top of things always.

Last but not least Elena who was actually my first contact at Cornette I credit with strongly influencing my decision to sign up with Cornette. She has always been very personable with me on the phone and has great insight into what tenants like to see. She takes care of touring properties and has a pulse on the market.

Quite frankly after reading all the angry reviews on here I was highly skeptical of Cornette when I first signed in. Elena helped alleviate some of those issues and then experience showed that sometimes the keyboard warriors are wrong. Oh and did I mention that Cornette management rates are simply unmatched in all of the Sacramento area? (I know I looked at about a dozen alternative!)

Thank you Monica, April, Jessica, Emily and Elena. You guys rock.< /Text>

I was a renter with Cornette Property for a one-year lease. About 6 months into my lease my water heater went out. I immediately contacted the maintenance service advisor and was told she would contact the owners immediately. After a day with no returned calls I was forced to drive to their office to talk to the maintenance advisor because she was always “busy” every time I would call. I was told that the cost for a new water heater was over a certain set limit and needed the approval of both homeowners, that’s right, there are two people who own the place I was renting. It just so happens that on of the owners was out of town for a week on an extended camping trip. She then proceeded to tell me that having no hot water was not an emergency and would “work on it”. I ended up going a week with cold showers at 4am to go to work during the late winter months. After FINALLY getting the water heater replaced, I sought out compensation for the week without hot water and then the maintenance adviser conveniently TOOK VACATION! At about two months left on my lease I was given notice that they would be raising my rent as well. At the end of my time with the rental I turned in my keys about 20 days before my lease expired due to me moving out of town. I just received an extremely high SMUD bill and can only assume that they were in the house after my keys were turned in but before my lease was expired. Overall, I was extremely dissatisfied with my year lease with this company and would strongly urge people to look elsewhere.< /Text>

{'time': 1564775632411, 'text': 'Dear Daniel,\nI am sorry to hear you had some frustrations with maintenance during your tenancy. After looking into the matter please see the below information.\n\nThe no hot water was reported to us 10/9/18 which was a little under 3 months after you moved in. This maintenance concern was reported to us at 10:05 am on 10/9/18. At that time our maintenance coordinator reached out to our vendor who was dispatched the same day. Our plumber reported that the water heater had to be replaced so the owner was contacted the same day. The replacement was over our approval amount which is why the owner was contacted. After business hours one of the owners approved the replacement, and not having hot water is in fact an emergency. The vendor was notified on 10/10/18 at 7:56 AM and installed a new one that day. Per the state of California not having hot water is an emergency and our maintenance department would not have told you it was not an emergency. I have gone back in your emails with the maintenance department and all documents we had on file for you and there was never a request for compensation. You gave notice that you would be vacating on 7/20/19 and then turned keys in on 7/10/19. Any usage from SMUD would have been your usage.

Seriously perplexed, had great references, and a few blemishes on my credit but I had paid most everything, I was denied a duplex. I made 4 and half time the rent and my rental history is fantastic, no evictions no nothing. I called to ask why I was denied and was told I had to many collections, I informed her that most I had paid she states, it doesn't matter they were still reported as collections. I've never heard of paying collections being a bad thing. Something is off. I do notice that the credit manager does reply on these reviews and it appears she Violates a lot of peoples Confidentiality. You are not to put peoples personal information regarding there past living arrangements or there references on a public forum, frankly it is poor business ethics and as a Manager you should be fully aware of what type of legal issues that can create. Be careful.

I have reached out to an attorney to see if it is legal to violate HIPPA by posting personal information in your response to my review. Thank you!< /text>

<Review>I applied for one of their properties and made a little more than 3x the rent, but it took them 3 weeks to get back to me with any information and even then, they replied to my wife's application/email (as a secondary applicant, not to me as the primary) telling us we were denied. Neither one of us saw that they had performed the credit check for either of us, so they basically took our $80 app fee and did NOTHING! I would not work with this place again even if I was homeless and they were giving away free houses. Total SCAM!< /Review>< pics>

<review>I have lived in a Cornette property for the past 5 years . Although rent increase is something totally out of our control, the property management is amazing. With accommodation repairs in an extremely timely manner, a wonderful knowledgeable staff and amazing sub contractors. Not that I have needed many repairs but what has been needed has been awesome! Nancy is top notch!!    Thank you for always taking care of me and my casa.<//review><Response>None<//Response><user_id>114387564179452075672< /user_id><Gmap_id>0x809ae6d321497795:0x4483e9b3b9fd83bb< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

As a newly approved applicant, I’m looking forward to moving into my new place. The application process was quick for a management company especially with it being such a high demand for rentals. The Cornette staff was very friendly during the process. Sarah rocked it during my “offer to rent” and I have been working with April while they prep the property for my family. Looking forward to a new place to call home.</review>

They get no star from me.  Went in today to co-sign for a friend and was told that I need to own a property in order to co-sign.  I had no issue co-signing for others before, this company told me that it was in their policy and its on the website.  I said where is it on the website because I didn't see it and she said it's on there.  Never will I ever go back or recommend this property management to anyone.  No star....even though it show's one star...no star for me...</Review>

<Text>I’m here to say that I am so upset to see these horrible reviews. I fell in love with a rental property and because of these reviews my partner will not apply to the house. If the property owner who owns the home on s Whitney blvd sees this. Please consider finding a different property manager who has good reviews.<//Text>< Pictures>

I have had nothing but great service from the kind, intelligent people at Cornette. I have been using their services to care for and rent my property for several years. They go above and beyond to help with renters, repairs, and service providers. I wouldn't go to any other property management company. I appreciate their professionalism, fair pricing and hard work.</text>

{'time': 1561488020860, 'text': 'Hello Arctica,\n\nWe have been in communication with you several times regarding the status of your application.  We do give out deadlines on applications when we have made several attempts per verification and are not receiving responses from landlords and employers. We typically reach out to each party 2 times prior to giving an applicant a deadline.  In this case when we had reached out to you and given your application a deadline, we were pending your co-applicant’s employer and your (Arctica) current and prior landlord verifications.  I sent you the update and deadline of the application on June 7th.  We had emailed your co-applicants employment verification 2 times, faxed out your current landlord verification form 2 times, and left 2 voicemails for your prior landlord.  You did respond letting me know that your prior landlord in fact did return our call and provided an email address to send the verification form to after the deadline was given. I sent out the verification and received that back that same day. At that time, I took the application off a deadline and reached out to your co-applicants’ employer one more time via email and called your current landlord and was directed to leave a voicemail to follow up on the fax that was originally sent out.  We still did not hear back from the employer or current landlord and reached out to you placing the application on a 2nd deadline on June 10th. After two days of not hearing from the employer, current landlord, or either applicant we placed the application inactive and notified you regarding the application being placed inactive on June 12th.  I did not hear anything from you or your co-applicant until June 19th asking who we had sent the verification forms too. I did respond letting you know again what verifications we were still pending. If you would like to call into the office, I will be more than happy to go over how your application was processed with you.\n\nSarah, Credit Manager'}<//resp>
< review>
I'm disappointed that the communicate with Sarah didn't go too well. I've provided all of the necessary documents requested including 6 months of bank statements, three months recent pay stubs and  my $70 fees and at the end my application was put on inactive. I wasn't informed of a deadline that must be meet for the application process. I have no knowledge of who was contacted in regards to verifying pass and current landlord. I've checked with my current landlord and she didn't  received any phone calls nor email. While waiting for my spouse  employment verification, I'm not sure who Sarah contacted with but wasn't able to provide the names of the person.  I checked with my spouse employer and no one receive any employment verification form. (Note that recent pay stubs were send in). While I was only given about an 24 hours notice to see if the landlord and employment verification gets send to Sarah, I did contact my landlords and employer but they didn't receive any paper. I did asked for Sarah to resend and contact the people the needs verification from. She stated that it was sent three times already. At the end, my application was put on inactive. I email Sarah to see who was the people that she's trying to get the verification from that it might be a error on my behalf...as of June 23,2019, no reply yet. It's been almost a month and I still have not found a home with Cornette. I feel like I've been a victim of a scam in a legit way to be its victim personal information then left to die. Hopefully Cornette reach out to me too... I'll update the review when they do.<//review>

We have been with Cornette for years and absolutely love them! They have always been professional and friendly. Their response time to service repairs is excellent.  Move in or move out, you can depend on it going smoothly. April, Sonya and Nancy have provided us with unbelievable service and support. We would not go with anyone else.<//Review>

<date>1580316330250</date><rate>1<//rate><review>I wish I would have read these reviews prior to applying! I applied for one of the units they have about 2.5 weeks ago. Thought the electronic pdf Offer Letter AND current pay stubs would be good enough employment verifications. I have responded to all the requests they asked for. Now they're asking for an offer letter on letterhead, mind you my Government job has an onboarding process electronically, and none of the Supervisors from ANY of the Government jobs I have worked will/can verify employment directly. So she says they have to deny my application because the pdf electronic Offer Letter isn't sufficient enough. Honestly I just want my $40 back and I'll pass on this one, because I doubt they've even started a credit check. I will be filing a fraud claim with my bank to have those funds returned!

I provided you a pdf copy of that letter last week and never nothing else was needed until I asked for a 5th status update. My supervisor still will not be able to provide you with a letter. Needless to say I applied to rent sometime around 1/14/2020, it should not take this long as well as I have not seen an alert that my credit report was pulled. Either way based on these reviews you have bad business practices for both tenants and landlords.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>
{'time': 1580311803053, 'text': 'Hello Tracy,\n\nWe were unable to accept your Job Offer Letter as it was not on a form of letterhead – It was simply in a word document. We tried to verify the information through the email provided at the bottom of the letter and they did not tell us to get the information from the work number. Instead they let me know to contact your supervisor directly which we are unable to do this until you start on Monday and you do not have this information yet.  You are welcome to come pick up a copy of your credit report. Our office located at 5655 Walnut Ave Orangevale, CA 95662 we can release a copy of your credit report to you during business hours.

<text>Nothing but love for Cornette ! Every encounter I’ve had with them has been smooth. From applying and getting approved, moving in and moving out. They are so helpful and informative throughout the entire process start to finish. I don’t know how many others can say the same about their property managers. I know my friends don’t have the best experiences. They even have an app for your phone to pay rent or see your payment history. Pretty snazzy ! I am now in my second rental managed by Cornette ! One day if I ever acquire my own real estate to rent out I would feel most comfortable with Cornette to take care of the home on my behalf. Thank you !!!!<//text><Rating>5</Rating>< Pics>

Most horrid customer service ever. Rude. Dismissive. Everyone we spoke to had a bad attitude and the amount of disrespect was nothing short of apalling. I don't understand how this company is still operational. I truly everyone in that office loses their job so they can't harrass anyone else.

Edit: you're response literally proves my point. Posting my personal information and situation publicly doesn't help you in the slightest. And for the record, we were approved instantaneously for a 3 bed 2 bath for higher than what you offered without a single late payment. (since we're posting personal info here) you guys are a joke. Instead of taking your one star reviews personally, do something about it. You guys are at 2.8 for a reason.< /Review>

{'time': 1522096135243, 'text': 'Hello:\n\nWe are sorry to hear you disagree with the security deposit refunded to you. It is our standard and policy when a tenant vacates a property to have the unit completely cleaned and carpets professionally steam cleaned with receipts provided to us. The items that needed to be cleaned and a list of deductions were sent to you. As far as maintenance repairs go – Once a tenant reports a maintenance issue, depending on the severity it may take some time to gather estimates. If other neighbors are involved such as fence repair where multiple homeowner approvals and funds are considered. Our maintenance coordinator works diligently with our preferred vendor list to get maintenance request addressed in a timely manner. We encourage our employees to ask our clients and tenants to write good reviews when they have a positive experience with our office. We have several different touch points with our current tenants from when a tenant moves into the property to when the tenants move outs as we like to obtain feedback. Also, we do not give out personal information unless authorized to do so. Unfortunately, you did not provide your name or information to investigate the details of your situation. If you would like to discuss this further or need us to provide you with the documentation again, please give our office a call.'}</Response>
<rating>1</rating><Text>If I could have said negative 5 stars I would of. Starting with the fact they like giving out your personal information to anyone who asks. Good luck trying to get your deposit back. Judy the owner is totally incompetent and will have nothing but excuses for everything. Good luck if you need any repairs done. In short you are better going anywhere else. Their 5 star reviews are put there by their employees. No accountability worst company bad owner stay away. But watch instead of saying were working to make the company better they will attact the post. Take heed of the warning.</Text>< gmapID>

Bad customer experience. When applying, they ran a "Hard Inquiry" on my credit, left numerous calls unreturned, and took weeks to finalize the application. For a renter, my advice is to find another management company. Bottom dollar seems to be held in a higher regard than tenants.< /text>
<Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>{'time': 1555612315048, 'text': 'Hello Jeffrey,\n\nWe do run credit through Trans Union and it is a hard inquiry on your credit report.  When you sign the application, you are giving us permission to run your credit and process the application.\n\nI spoke with your co-applicant Andrea several times during the application process on the phone and through email.  When you first applied for the property and your credit was ran, we reached out to you letting you know the application was being denied on credit. Combined there were several lines of credit with multiple late payments and collections. After you disputed the denial and we spoke regarding your previous home and being a victim of the camp fire I went ahead and processed the remaining of the application. During that conversation I stated that all I could do is process the information and leave it up to the Homeowner for the final decision.  After the application was fully processed, income and tenancy verifications, I presented the application to the Homeowner. The Homeowner decided to deny the application off credit and the income did not meet the three times the income qualifications. When I reached out to you regarding their final decision the email also stated that you could try to transfer your application over to another available property and that I would reach out to another Homeowner.\n\nI understand the frustration and devastation of loosing your home in the fire. I tried to help and do what I could with your application. Unfortunately, with the other circumstances we were not able to move forward with that particular home. If you would like to contact our office to discuss the possibility of other available rentals, I would be more than happy to do so.\n\nThank you,\n\nApplication Department.'}<//resp>< GmapID>

Yeah no i just didn't like how impersonal and dismissive the application process was. You denied us right away with no real explanation or a chance to explain ourselves.  We made all the qualifications and had the deposit ready to move in and were excited but You threw our hopes and dreams out the window. My coapplicants were always on time with rent and are good tenants. You trust the word of one landlord without giving them a chance to dispute it. He just doesnt want them to move out so he made it so they couldn't. If you were a good company you would give people a chance instead of taking applications money and not working with an applicant who is clearly eager to rent.</Review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

< review>
Cornette has managed a property for us for more than 8 years.  They are professional, organized and always follow the regulations regarding leasing, tenant and landlord responsibilities.  We recently had a tenant turnover and April was an incredible help in making decisions, budgeting and organizing work that was needed on the home.  We are hands on from afar about these details and April and Nancy were always patient with our frequent inquiries about the bids and approach to the work that was being done. They are strict on tenant move-out responsibilities re: cleaning and condition of the property. I would recommend that tenants read leases very carefully about cleaning responsibilities and notify re: anything that they find amiss with the property when they move in . And, take advantage of Cornette's option for tenants to be present at the move out inspection to ensure they have the opportunity to discuss any issues.  As landlords we have sometimes approved Cornette to waive some move out charges if we feel on balance we've had a good tenant, but not every owner will do the same.</review>

She looked like she would rather be anywhere else in the world than doing her job. Never heard a word back and now their is an application pending. So I’m out a day of pay and still have to keep looking for a place to live.

We have rented our house for over 6 years now. They have a different person in charge of everything from rent payments, to scheduling yearly inspections, to communicating things to the owner when needed, to maintenance, etc. There is always someone to help all the time, they even have after hours help when needed.< /Review>

Before we rented from Cornette I read all the review and was really worried. After driving by the house a few times and discussing it with my husband we decided to go for it as we really liked the house and it had everything we were looking for. Again we were both worried about all the negative reviews. We have been in this house for almost a year and have not had one issue with Cornette. We have had a few repairs that needed attention and they have been fixed in a timely manner. There has been one problem that has not been fixed but they have been in contact with me regarding this. Our pool skimmer broke a wheel over a weekend and it had to be replaced. We went and purchased the part, I took the receipt in the next day and they called me the next day saying my check was ready to pick up or they could mail it. We are hoping to renew our lease again. So far we are really happy with Cornette!!<//text>

I do apologize that you did not have a good experience with our company.  During the application process we did have a hard time getting your verifications back in a timely manner.  I see emails between you and the application department during the time of processing giving several updates.  The orginal contact information that was provided for your current landlord was invalid.  We notified you right away regarding needing updated contact information. We were not provided with a valid email address to send the verification to until the 27th. We sent that out right away.  We did not receive your current landlord verification back until the 30th. The property manager signed and dated in on the 30th and it was emailed back to us that afternoon.  We emailed right after we received the verification that you were no longer on a deadline and that we have all your verifications back.  After all the verifications were completed, we did present your application to the property owner along with 2 other completed applications. The owner did decide to select another applicant. Your application was never denied and we did offer for you to transfer your application to any other available property. We apologize that we could not help you with a rental at this time and wish you the best of luck in the near future.\n\nThank you,\nSarah  – Credit Manager'}< /Resp>
<GmapID>0x809ae6d321497795:0x4483e9b3b9fd83bb<//GmapID><Text>By far the worst experience I’ve ever had dealing with any so called “business”.  The website clearly states that after applying you’ll have a decision in 1-2 business days (I understand it may take longer), yet I applied Aug. 9th and just found out Sept 3rd that the landlord decided to go with a different applicant. The entire time I had to follow up with them (Should be the other way around) which was extremely difficult considering it is impossible to get ahold of anyone in the application dept as it would go directly to voicemail every time, (although if you call the main number directly the reception will get the person working in applications on the phone)... interesting. Communication is key in any business especially when you’re dealing with someone’s home, and they failed me horribly. I would highly discourage anyone from doing business with them and if they were currently managing my property I would be highly concerned as to the money they were costing me by their ineptness.

Their response below is exactly what the problem is. It never occurred to them to let me know that the owners are out of the country and a response will be delayed. This courtesy would’ve went a long way when I’m moving from another city and needed a place to live ASAP.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

First time i applied they never even contacted me by phone or email to let me know if i was approved or denied still ran my credit, second time everyone in our household had decent credit standing but one, made 6xs the amount they required monthly plus had a good chunk in savings and still managed to deny us. They take application fees and profit off of them. Would never do business here. I am thankful for my current landlords now as they are much more professional.

Edit: I am absolutely appalled by the response i received. How about privately messaging me to discuss personal matters but since we are. I contacted Cornette property management before applying and explained that our credit was sub par they made me feel reassured that despite that they could make it work if all other criteria was met (rental history, clean background, etc which we have) and that they could increase deposit. We as a whole make $14,000 monthly, and have $25,000 in savings. My roommate had a medical emergency, that is why his credit was the lowest but my credit wouldnt be the best if i had an explosive device go off on me either (which was also explained) . The lack of response with a denial/approval was from 2014 when i first applied with this company, i figured i was one of the very few that got swept under the rug, which i understand happens, so i figured I'd give them a second chance because no business is perfect they still ran my credit but i didnt receive a denial letter or a call (for 2014). Which is required by state law. I am personally happy i did not get approved because if i did meet the hard criteria here i would just buy my own home instead.

Also i see a frequent theme with the negative reviews, a lack of communication. I have to compliment the skills on the response time to negative reviews but maybe instead going further put more energy upfront into response time and making people feel good, even if they did get denied. I understand by no means is it your fault if someone gets denied on lack of something but even a simple, I am really sorry that i could not help you, i understand that it is a very stressful time for you, but please consider us again in the future if you have a chance to build your credit, get a negative mark taken care of, increase your income, etc. Instead try being interpersonal while we are clients we are human beings as well. It makes it unfortunate when i see people getting embarassed by you disclosing their personal information for the world to see, people fall on hard times and while i understand negative responses effect your business practices if you changed from within your responses even in negative times would differ completely. You have to understand that some of these people whom are applying are about to be homeless if your applications are not done in a timely matter. If someone is denied i highly reccomend partnering with local property managements to use as referals to better assist your clients in finding a home, if they get denied wouldnt it be easier to get a cut of $50 per client referred or something along those lines that way you are not leaving your clients high and dry and you still get to share in the profit, while i understand the need of running a business the nicer and more helpful you are to even the worst of clients will show the world your character. But as it stands with all of these reviews you disclosing bounced checks almost like a highschooler on twitter i cannot take this company seriously.<//text>

This company raise the rent to ridiculous amount. When you have to speak to them they are sarcastic and rude. They can't even keep there books straight. When you need something fixed it get half fixed. Renting from this management company is a nightmare they only care about money and not the tenants. The owners of these properties need to read there reviews.< /Review>

<Text>We have actually had a pretty decent experience with Cornette.  At the beginning I will admit it was a little shaky.  The duration of our stay however (2 years) was uneventful.  Everytime we had a maintenance issue and had to call Nancy she took care of it immediately.  Unfortunately, the owner of the house died and the beneficiary of his trust is selling the house.  Otherwise we would have stayed long term.  We gave our 30 days notice and confirmed with the office that it was received.  We have not moved out yet and have not had to deal with getting our deposit back.  I hope the rest of the process goes as smoothly as the last 2 years.  I will update the post if it goes south.</Text><response>None<//response>< Pictures>

You have read before, "If I could leave a no stars, I would" this time I would leave a negative star. I can not even express the disgust I have toward this company. Crooks and shysters, if you think you can get your security deposit back from these people, think again. Liars from day one, they promised to clean the carpet and paint the walls before we moved in, non of that was done. When we moved out we paid out of pocket to get the carpet cleaned and walls repainted and house cleaned. This company is truly deserves to get audited and license revoked.< /review>

<review>I rather give this company a no star. We were honest with them about us having bad credit. They told us they base on income and rental history so not to worry about credit report. At the end after we pay and did the whole process they said it was our credit that we were decline. Lying scams they just want your money $$$$$$$.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
So far so good. I was originally told that the duplex i wanted had a pending application and that i should call in a few days to find out if it was rented. I did and the duplex was still available.I was call within 15 minutes of leaving a message requesting to view the property. I was told there would be a viewing the next day. Everything went as planned. I sent in my application via e-mail and mailed out the check for the application fee the next day. I called to confirm that it was received by the right person and i actually got a call back and an e-mail confirming my check and applications where received. So far so good. I sent an e-mail with a couple of questions today and am hoping to hear back. i really hope my experience with Cornette is different that what you kind people have described.</Review>

On January 16, 2015 my home that I was renting from Cornette Properties caught fire. Nancy with Cornette was on the scene to help us. Nancy was wonderful she helped us the whole weekend even after the fire when people broke into the home. When channel 13, 10 came out to interview us due to the fire and the 7 strangers that saved our animals, we were told by Cornette that we don’t have to worry that we will have first dibs on a place that we like through them. Cornette gave me back my deposit and the rent for January which I though was more than wonderful.  Well, after the smoke cleared it went from we will help you don’t worry to you have to fill out another application and start from scratch. I was like okay, I though since I was already with your company and the fire wasn't my fault it didn't even start in my unit that I would get help from them. Not sure what‘s going on. I have been homeless for a month now my animals are in the pet day care until I can find something. I thought that cornette would help me and I found a place but now it’s taking a long time to even process the application they told me that I had to fill out.  I fill like since the fire they are using me as an example to do things right but for what? I was just an innocent person living in my unit and now this happens. I stayed with Cornette because they know my history and I thought I was good with them but I guess that has all changed. I’m just is shock they were so nice to us and everything. I’m starting to think maybe they just did that for the news people to make themselves look good. I not sure but I do know this the office staff that I have met are very nice and Judy Cornette was wonderful went I was crying in the office so maybe they don’t know about thee lady Megan that  handles the  application processing  she tells me that she called me when she really didn't. its people like the lady that showed the place and other people in the office that brings them down so I would Judy the  company as a whole just some of the people in the office that makes them look bad because like I said Nancy, Judy and the front office staff is great and even thou I’m  getting the run around form the application process lady I would still refer people to them to rent because before the fire  and after they have still been nice to  me.</review>

This company is such a fraud. They took most of my security deposit and refused to give me real invoices on items that were supposedly cleaned or broken. I left that house in great clean condition. I kept the home clean and well mantained. This is unfair. Look at the reviews on yelp and here, they all say the same. They are a fraud. Do not rent from them.< /text>

Let's just say finding a new property in less than 60 days has been challenging so far. I wasn't planning on moving and out of nowhere found out that the owner of the house I live at is selling. It's so hard to get a hold of a live person these days, so I was pleasantly surprised when I called Cornette and someone picked up. I don't do the computer thing, I like to actually talk to people.  Elaina, one of the property managers listened to my rant lol and gave me helpful suggestions. She gave me showing times of properties that she thought I would like and I am going to see some houses today! It makes me feel a little hopeful about my situation, so thank you Elaina and staff.</review>

I have to say that this has been the worst experience ever and absolutely zero customer service!!! None of you talk to each other and just put notes on a computer and hope eventually somebody reads it. I know because i went into the office personally this morning. The girl at the front desk is really friendly but my weiner dog has a better chance at processing information. You guys sent the wrong people the wrong information to process and I have potentially lost out on good homes because of your lack of communication and effort. I understand you are busy and have other things going on but figure out how to multi task a bit better. This is rediculous!!! Rest assured I will never deal with you guys and this is going to be posted!

If you are looking to use cornette... DON'T!!! RUN AWAY< /Text>

<user_id>105864439693224756661< /user_id><review>Disappointed in this place. Me and my significant other were denied for a property because the owner of my current property has the same last name as my significant other. Smh I’ve never heard of something so rediculous in my life. I provided my property managers contact information as this is the person I signed my lease agreement with as well as worked with for my entire stay. I’ve never met the owner of my current home, and was told because my property manager circled that he was the owner and the owner has the same last name as my significant other I was denied. I was told that they thought that we were doing something fraudulent. I’ve never been treated this way before and I’m offended. I mean my significant other has a very common Hispanic last name and it just so happens that the owner of my property has the same last name. In addition my significant other moved to California in 2015 when we began dating, lol and I signed my lease in 2013. I was clearly denied for an assumption, when I paid my money to receive a proper background check which didn’t happen. I was then told that they now see that my property management does work for a legit company, but why was this not researched before denying me. Now the property that I applied for is rented and I lose my money. Seriously disappointed.</review><Response>{'time': 1524605007631, 'text': 'As explained in our phone conversation on April 20th 2018 the application was denied based on false tenancy verification.  The person that we reached out to regarding your rental verification for your current tenancy verification stated that he was the homeowner of the property you currently reside at.  We do check ownership on any rental verification where the person we reach out to states they are the home owner.  In this case the homeownership did not match.  At that time the application was denied on a false tenancy verification.  We emailed you the reason for the denial on 04/10/2018 and mailed out a hard copy of the denial on 04/12/2018 to your most recent address listed on the application.  We did not hear anything from you until you emailed asking for more details on the denial on 04/20/2018.  I reached out to you via phone to discuss the denial that same day.  At that time, I explained to you the reason for the denial being a false tenancy verification we received.   Only at that time did you explain to me that the person who gave the verification was a Broker and not the Homeowner.  There was no other way we would have known that information.  It was not previously disclosed to us on the application.   The Broker also did not disclose to us the he was a Broker and managed the property for the home owner. During the duration of our phone conversation I did ask you if your co-applicant was related to your current home owner due to the last names being the same.  We see family members giving false tenancy verifications all the time and have to ask that question or there would have been no other way to know if they were related or not.  You were able to clear that up for us by telling me that they were not related.  I was very clear that was not the reason for the denial or we would have had to disclose that when the denial email went out along with the hard copy letter that was mailed out to you.  After everything was disclosed during our phone conversation we had discussed for you to send over your lease agreement and that I would reach out to the Broker again to clear up the wrongful verification he did on his end and that we would be able to move forward with placing your application towards another property.  The property you had originally applied for had been rented.  I suggested that you visit our website over the weekend and see if there were any other properties you would be interested in.  We were willing to clear up the situation regarding your rental history and move forward.  Not once during our phone conversation did you mention anything about being racially profiled, which is not the case.  We are very strict about following all fair house rules and regulations and the denial was strictly based on the Broker giving a false tenancy verification that he was the homeowner.'}<//Response>< username>

<review>It seems that all these negative reviews are from people that got denied for bad credit. Well it clearly states the qualifications on the application, so its not really anyone fault except the people with poor credit. I think its great that cornette accepts co signers ,a lot of companies do not do that. Elena the girl who answered the phones explained all of this to me and I'm glad she was clear and consise in regards to the qualifications.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Time>

Stay away from this company. Rented a home for over a year. The house was over 30 yrs old with minimal upgrades. It served its purpose for our family during that time. I paid the rent on time and left the home in the same condition as when I moved in. California law states a landlord has 21 days to return the security deposit or provide an estimate of damages. On the 21 day mark I received a estimate of damage my equaling $2100 security deposit. They were bogus claims and issues present prior to moving in. In addition they estimated I owed them an additional 250. I have the move in inspection report with pictures as well took move out pictures and video. They will not look at it until all work is complete. It's now over 60 days no word from conrnette and I've been told they are still waiting on work to be done to the home. It's funny there are already tenants living in it. they are exploiting the renter population unethical business practices.</text>

I'm a tenant and have lived at the same property for over 2 years. I called over a month ago about my leaking roof. Still no response. Would you want a property you own having a leaking roof during rain season and them sitting on their thumbs?

I put my 30 day notice in because I am buying a house, and they made an appointment to show the residence without my consent when the property is still OCCUPIED!

They do not return phone calls, and they do not respond to maintenance problems.<//review>

<Review>I had to call after hours today to get my AC fixed. Although I could tell Gloria was very annoyed that I called, she did get someone to my place within an hour and the guy was quick and very polite (this review in no way reflects his service). During normal hours I can reach them via email which is great and I am getting a good price on my unit. There were a few misunderstandings in the beginning on when each water bill was due, when I asked they didn't seem to really know, so I just had to wait and see what I was going to get billed. Sonya is nice, Brittney is mean. Haven't worked with Nancy but heard she is nice. They have really good prices on rent and I'm not going to lie, I love my place and I can deal with their rudeness if I have to lol<//Review></record></dataset><record>

this company shouldn't be in business. I have a friend that has been living in a duplex and has called them to repair the AC for over 9 months now.  They have disregarded her requests. We are now entering into the 10 month and still no AC with triple digits. I will be calling channel 3 on this company and let them see the emails that have transpired back and forth between them. They don't even deserve a star< /text>

{'time': 1504043682046, 'text': 'On July 28, 2017 the tenant reported that her air conditioner was not working.  A work order was dispatched to the vendor who left several voicemail messages for the tenant to call back and schedule, with no return phone calls from the tenant.  The tenant then advised me that she cannot use her phone during working hours and it was best that the vendor contact her via email, which he did.  The tenant again did not respond. We have had this same issue with another vendor who reported on several occasions that the tenant was not responding to their telephone calls or emails. We have checked emails back to February and see no emails regarding the air conditioning.  I have emailed the tenant again today and gave her the vendor’s telephone number and requested that she contact them to schedule an appointment.  We know that she is eager to have her air conditioning working and we are just as eager to get this resolved for her, but she needs to return the vendor’s telephone calls and schedule an appointment.'}</Response>

{'time': 1503002333054, 'text': 'Hello Casey: In regards to the maintenance issues, you have stated that Nancy did not call the contractor to ask them to work with you to come to the house when the problem is occurring. To the contrary, Nancy spoke to the contractor and informed them of the intermittent problem with your air conditioner. The vendor came to the house, but could not duplicate the problem. You were also told that because the issues were intermittent and only lasted a few hours, the vendor may not have someone in the area and/or able to pull off a job to come to the house, and informed by Nancy that air conditioners, due to age, will sometimes turn off and/or blow warm air in extreme temperatures. Your air conditioner (upstairs only) would blow warm air for a few hours and then start blowing cold. Per the HVAC repairman this is very indicative of air conditioner units in extreme weather. After not hearing back from you, it was assumed the issue was fixed. Especially since the extreme weather had passed. It would have been greatly appreciated if you contacted our office with your concerns when the owner reached out to you rather than passively posting a review online.                                                                                Prior to you taking occupancy of your residence the carpets were professionally cleaned by Fairest of All Carpet Cleaning on 12/01/2015 and you moved into the property on 12/04/2015. On the invoice from the carpet cleaning company and the move in inspection, the condition of the carpet has been noted.\nOur collection department automatically sends out letters through our software program regarding a delinquent balance regardless of the total amount past due, this is why you received the letter.\nYou stated the first time you came to the office you heard a manager tell one of the staff members to not worry about a compliant received as we did not care about the person who had called. We would never discuss matters of conflict with staff members at the front desk, all complaints and concerns are addressed appropriately when received in our office.\nRegarding contacting the owner at Cornette Property Management, there was never an email or voicemail received from you. After you were given the name, phone number and email of the owner, you state you would contact the owner but to date she has not received a message from you. Nancy and the owner left a message for you on your voicemail and there was no response. The emails between you and Nancy have been reviewed and her replies to you were professional, courteous, and informative.\nIn regards to your comment about releasing personal information in a response below; unfortunately, when someone publicly lists slanderous and false allegations, we must be able to respond to their claims. Without factual statements and responses in return, we would not be able to respond to these allegations.'}</Resp>

I would love to give a negative star review. LOVE TO. Cornette has been shady from the word go. The first time I ever went in to their office I heard a manager tell one of the staff that someone had just called to complain about them but not to worry about it because she didn't care about the person who called. Nevertheless, we rented. The carpets weren't cleaned when we moved in (Cornette assured us they had been, but there was only so much the cleaners could do.) About 8 months into the first year of our lease Cornette sent us a letter to let us know we owed them $2. From 6 months ago. Odd, ridiculous even, but we paid. Maintenance is a joke. We have had contractors come out to fix something and then stumble across another issue, which they say they'll tell Cornette about because all repairs have to be approved by them. Didn't hear back from Cornette at all, and they only did anything when we asked them why they hadn't. Currently we've been dealing with an AC repair issue for a month and a half. Nancy is condescending and unprofessional, refusing to do so much as make a phone call to the contractor to ask them to work with us to come to the house when the problem is occurring. I asked her literally 5 times for her supervisor's contact information. She told me I could call the office, and when I FINALLY got an email address from her, as I work during Cornette's open hours and can't really tear myself away to deal with their buffoonery, she followed up with an email saying that the owner, Judy Cornette, wouldn't open or read any email that wasn't from anyone she specifically requested an email from or already knew. Clearly she really wants to discuss her customers issues with the horrible service they're receiving. She probably encourages it based on the attitudes I've gotten. I would also invite you to read the comments below where whoever is responding to these reviews totally revealed private financial information about someone who had applied. SUPER professional and not at all ethically reprehensible. And based on the other reviews, I can't wait to fight with them for months about our security deposit after we move out. NEVER RENT FROM CORNETTE.</text>

<review>They seem to have the best houses in the Orangevale area. I'm looking in the Orangevale area and the property I really wanted got snatched up so fast, but then there were 2 more that became available. I really want to stay in this area for my kids school, and I think Cornettes rentals are going to be my best bet.

Cornette has some great 4 bedrooms in the Rocklin and Roseville area that I'm going to apply for.

Cornett property took over a rental I was already in, I was a very good tenant, gave them 30 days notice when I was ready to move to a closer area to work, I was not allowed to do a walk through after I moved out so I did take pictures, Judy sent me a refund check for a full refund of my deposit (cause I left that place clean)but only she wrote the date wrong so I was not able to cash the check!  I called and was told to come on in and pick up another check (30 minutes away) to be told Judy left on vacation!!!!!  I had to act out of my character because the whole office was lying to me, after making a claim with the BBB I finally received another check, Judy Cornett is definetly something else and I will never rent from her again!!!<//review>< Time>

It’s been two weeks since me and my other filed a pre-approval application. Every time I call back to check on the status I keep getting told that they haven’t heard a response from our previous landlords. I called both of them twice, and cornette never attempted to contact them. I keep feeling like cornette is blowing me off in the most unprofessional way. This company is extremely inefficient and lazy. They gladly took my money for the application but don’t want to do their job.</Review>

<resp>{'time': 1520372831008, 'text': "Hello Andrew, To this day we are currently waiting on the prior landlord verifications for both you and the other applicant you've applied with. When you came into the office on Tuesday, I personally gave you an update regarding your application, also you selected a specific property to transfer your application to at that time. For the other applicants prior tenancy verification we have faxed it out on 2/22/18, 2/23/18, and 2/26/18 - We also emailed this three different times on 2/26/18, 2/27/18 and 3/5/18. For your prior tenancy verification we had to leave a message on 02/22/18 and 02/23/18 prior to getting an actual email to send the verification for completion. This verification has now been emailed three times 2/26/18, 2/27/18, and 3/2/18.  On several different occasions I asked you and the other applicant to reach out to your prior landlords to notify them I was trying to obtain these verifications to complete your application. I had also suggested to the other applicant via email on 2/28/2018 that if either one of you would like to schedule an appointment with me in office I would be more than willing to sit down and show you all the emails and proof of attempts to both your prior landlords. There was never an attempt on your end to schedule that appointment."}<//resp><gmapID>0x809ae6d321497795:0x4483e9b3b9fd83bb</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

This company is horrible! With the exception of Shannon, who should really go to a better company.

If you rent from them, expect to be charged $200+, even if you clean the residence immaculately. They sent us the refund of our deposit the day before 21 days were up. And this is for a place that we had to clean ourselves before we moved in! There were dings in the walls, no hanger bars in the closets, permanent markers on some of the walls, and what looked like gel icing drawn on the wall in the bathroom.

Avoid this company like the plague!<//text>

Trying to find a rental in this market has been crazy. I have called several property management companies. Most times the front desk people seem annoyed when I ask questions. But the receptionist at cornet property management are very helpful. I was having trouble downloading the PDF application, and the receptionist Alayna went out of her way to email and fax me a copy to make sure I got one.i've started the application process, and so far it has been a breeze.<//Text>

<review>I wouldn't even waste your time applying with them. Honestly it seems like they only want your application fee, act like they are going to approve you, and then send a denial letter the same day. And then they won't tell you why they denied you. I've called and asked many times and all they say is "we can't disclose that" or "you have to call the creditor ". Waste of money and time.<//review><Rating>1< /Rating><Response>None</Response><userid>116539183864879336785</userid><Pics>None</Pics>< Date>

"I only completed the first few steps with Cornette and the decided not to rent from then after dealing with their horrible communication and even worse reviews.

I applied online and that was the only good/ easy part of the process. It took them 3 weeks to process our application. They NEVER return voicemails and it took multiple calls throughout the day to even get ahold of someone to check on things (they never gave us solid answers). When my application was going up the chain they said it takes how long it takes and their is no time frame to let me know if I was approved for the property. A week later when they called to let us know we were approved was the only time they acted semi professional they wanted us to put down a nonrefundable deposit before we could even see the house.

After debating over night with my partner we decided not to rent from them due to almost everyone stating that repairs were not made and deposits were stolen upon move out and the updates were done."<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Terrible company. Everything about it is a joke. Reading other reviews is pretty spot on from what we have observed from renting from them for 3 months. Maintenance is a complete joke. Took 3 weeks for them to fix a dishwasher which was very annoying. It has been over 3 weeks and we have not been able to use our master bath shower because the glass shower door had shattered due to faulty installation. (And yes the heavy glass door fell on my wife and shattered while she was in the shower leaving a complete bloody, mess).<//Text>

Went to a viewing of a duplex yesterday, was really excited, given applications and was told we could bring them in the next morning. Well we spent all morning getting everything we need together and we get there and they said they are maxed out on apps and aren't accepting anymore. I asked if they knew that yesterday when they were showing the place and was told that the agent who scheduled the showing may not have know because they don't keep in contact like that. Not sure if this is the norm for other property management companies but it's very unprofessional.</Text>

<Response>{'time': 1499444910870, 'text': 'Hello Sarah: An application status can change within a matter of seconds. At the time you had called into our office, we were accepting applications; however, due to how competitive the rental market is at this time some prospective tenants are putting in applications prior to viewing a property. Even though we have reached our maximum intake of processing applications, the property has not been rented and there is not a deposit placed in order to remove the property from our available listings. It is not uncommon that once we’ve began processing an application, the applicant does not qualify and we are able to accept more applications. Nonetheless a pending application does not guarantee the property has been rented, as the status of an application can change at any given time for various reasons. When our agents and/or representatives are made available for showings they don’t always come to the office. Again the status of an application can change at any time making it near impossible to be able to allow for accurate information, unless of course by speaking with our office staff directly. You are always welcome to contact our office to inquiry about an application status prior to viewing a property.'}</Response><gmapID>0x809ae6d321497795:0x4483e9b3b9fd83bb</gmapID></record>

This is a SLUM lord company. They bait and switched me on the unit they advertised stating the one advertised is not available for another two weeks. After moving in to Timberlake Lake condos there were many problems with the unit. Leaking faucet wasp nests on the deck. After my year lease expired they raised my rent stating unforseen costs. Upon moving out I gave writen 30 day notice and called and emailed them when the unit would be vacant. I spoke with Jessica who was very rude to me and stated they never got my 30 day notice and will charge me an additional 30 days rent due to that. I explained they got a lower rent check which included the notice but they did not ask why the rent was short, so they got thenotice. Now they are trying to charge an additional months rent or more. I delt with the VERY RUDE JESSICA! I will now have to fight them in court.</text>

Poor customer service, thieves, liars, and any negative word in the book could be used to describe this company. I was told a number of times that a property was available turned in applications and was then told it was unavailable and my application was un-refundable.  Why would I turn in an application for a property that was not available. Then I call back regarding my refund and was told again no refund would be given but I could do another application because  Now the property is available. scammed out of application fees all the while dealing with Brittany who has no clue how to communicate nor deal with potential residents. Save yourself the money, time and headache by avoiding these unprofessional girls.

ps. You won't ever get a call back and if you do want information  the answer you'll get is "check back monday" "check back friday". Worst property management company ever.< /review>

I have a bit of a story here and the most interesting is that I have not rent from this company before. today they had a showing at 11:40 a.m. I absolutely got there before the person who was supposed to be showing the apartment but no one was there and I saw two guys in different cars who had came and park their cars in the front gate where we were suppose to meet the guy but none of them stepped out of their car so that we know if they live there or where there to show the apt. Anyways this shittyass company have no customer service. I called the office and they said supposedly the guy waited for 7 mins and noone showed up and i told her how could that be? I got there 5 mins before anyone and i was even out of my car waiting patiently. Not even gonna give them money im not desperate for this type of customer service. Watch yal go down.</review>

Oh my goodness! someone on here mentioned Gloria! I couldnt believe the reviews i was reading and how i could relate to some of the things that were being said here. Gloria has the worst customer service ever. I work in sales, specifically mortgage refinances, and I had called to ask about a home for rent, Gloria was the one who answered and acted like her time was so precious and didnt want to talk to me or tell me about the property. Then she proceeded to tell me its not available and that she doesnt know why they posted it online... I asked about the application process, she tells me to go online and figure it out... I am so shocked on how this company handles customer inquires.. I know if I acted like this everytime someone called about a mortgage, I'd be out of a job...

I hope people read these reviews, because they are so real.. if you dont believe us, give them a call yourself...

poor poor service!!!<//text>

I can't say enough bad about this company. EVERY single person that works there besides Ruth, who left a long time ago (and warned me about the service level and lies) has horrible customer service, horrible follow up, and they LIE!!!!!!!!!!! My husband and I rented a Lincoln house on Laehr Drive and just moved out in July 2012. Wonderful nieghbors, the owner of the property and Cornette made our stay there one of the worst years. I have rented a TON of houses, aptartments,duplexes and have NEVER EVER had such a miserable, horrible, never to forget this nightmare experience.

From the previous reviews I have read, Cornette seems to be a pretty decent property management company for people who own property which is managed by Cornette.  I, on the other hand, am a renter and have had a horrible experience with the company.  I actually don't rent from them but was treated So poorly during the process of being approved for a property that I just said "forget it" and walked away from the property.  Originally I found a property online that would become available Aug. 1.  Keep in mind they listed the property WEEKS before it was available.  So I called multiple times to keep up with the date the townhome would become available and to ask any general questions regarding deposits and such.  I called a few days before the 1st to confirm that it would still be available and was told that someone had already turned in an aplication and had been approved.  For some odd reason I called back a day or so later and was told that the property was actually still available but that it was now not going to be vacated until the 8th.  I was going to be out of the country starting the 11th so I made the decision to drive from downtown to Orangevale to drop off an application so that if I were approved, I would be the 1st person to view the property.  Cornette recieved my app on a Friday and said I would be notified when I had been approved and once they recieved the keys.  When I never heard from them that Monday I called Tuesday to find out if I had been approved and was told I would have to speak with Shannon.  I left her a voicemail but never heard back.  I left for vacation and when I returned on the 16th (10 days after I have turned in my application) I still have no messages from Cornette or Shannon.  I called and left another message for Shannon and was told that the company was having a "hard time getting the keys."  This was weird and confusing to me and I was pretty fed up and told them that I was no longer interested in that property but if my applicatio stayed on file I would keep looking.  I was then told that my application had never been processed!!! I told the girl I was very displeased with the lack of communication on their part and to just shred my check and left ANOTHER message for Shannon to call me to make sure this happened.  It is now Aug. 30 and after 2 more messages to Shannon, I have STILL never recieved a call back. Not once.  How frustrating and disappointing.  I'm not sure how companies are capable of running on such blatant rudeness and miscommunication.  A simple call back after many messages would have been nice and would have kept me from feeling the need to write a bad review.........< /text>

STAY AWAY FROM THEM!!! WORST PROPERTY MANAGEMENT EVER!!!  I am a neighbor of one of their properties. Not only have they refused to pay for up keep of their property, but once I started fixing the issues myself they contacted my job and tried to get me in trouble.</Review>

<resp>{'time': 1503006745994, 'text': 'Hello Tim: You have accused us of contacting your place of employment. As you are fully aware, you have been communicating with the owner of the property, who is not an employee of Cornette Property Management. The communication with the owner was regarding the shared cost of the replacing and repairing the fence which separates the two properties. After numerous threats that you had been consulting with legal counsel and city inspector while using your official Governor’s office email, the property homeowner contacted the Director in the Governor’s office to put a stop to receiving these email correspondences. The property homeowner did not think it was appropriate for you to email him in this context, especially when using your official work email from the Governor’s office.  Due to the fact that you used a work email to communicate with the property homeowner, he had the contact information to communicate with your office.\n\nSeveral times in the emails sent to you, the property homeowner had agreed to pay 50% of the reasonable costs to replace and/or repair the common fence by a licensed and professional contractor. The estimate received from you to fix the fence was more expensive than a licensed contractor, and you moved your fence approximately 10’ closer to the street adding to the shared cost of materials and the property homeowner stated he is not willing to pay more to expand your backyard.\n\nUntil you wrote the review about our company, we had never had any contact or correspondence from or to you, your communication and dealings had been directly with the homeowner of the property. We consider your actions to be slanderous and defamatory toward our business as you have knowingly posted false allegations. We would have expected more integrity from someone who works in the Governor’s office.'}<//resp><Gmap_id>0x809ae6d321497795:0x4483e9b3b9fd83bb<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I love Gomo's Fish Market. Whenever I’m hungry and in Inglewood CA, I think of  Gomo’s Fish Market. Gomo’s is a take-out restaurant that has the best seafood gumbo in Los Angeles. My wife and children love the fried shrimp lunch special. The coating on the shrimp is amazing. My favorite is the charbroiled filet of Sole in garlic butter sauce. It is served to me on a bed of rice and a side of greens. It’s very delicious. Steven takes my order, give me an estimated time the food will be ready, and hands my prepared food when it’s ready. I highlight Steve because he’s so cool. He does not mind giving you ask for extra bread or hot sauce without extra charge. Gomo’s hot sauce is so good that many people ask for extra. You can also buy fresh fish and have it cooked for you. The prices at Gomo's are reasonable. I highly recommended Gomo’s Fish Market.</review>

<review>This is my go-to fish market 4 the best in fried catfish fillets. Seasoned to perfection crust is always on point. Really good bang for your buck as they sell by the pound, and they're gumbo is on point as well. The owner is a really nice guy business conscious and the business seems to be blowing up, when I was there last the phone never stopped ringing. Once I even came there with some shrimp and small lobster tails that were going to go bad in my freezer that I thawed out and he breaded and fried them up for me for five bucks.< /review>< Pictures>

<Text>This is the BEST FISH Market in Town/Inglewood.  I'm telling you if you have an appetite for some fish, Gomo's has the BEST FRIED FISH in town.  My friend veteran Celebrity Hairstylist Miss Shirlena Allen was in town and wanted me to bring her some fish . I just happen to be Inglewood and said to her you don't have any taste for Dylan's Soul food or Roscoe's Chicken n Waffles? She said no. I was time limited for our meeting so I googled fish market and Gomo's popped up one block away.  I wasn't impressed when I arrived and almost didn't go in.</Text><Response>None</Response>< time>

My 1st experience fish is delicious the inside of the restaurant looks as if it's never cleaned from front to back then on top of that I order two pieces of fish he says 18.30 then he asks if I wanted it cooked I say yes of course he says ok 20.10 why if it's free to cook seems it's not free to cook I called and asked why he say 18.30 and when I he asked if i wanted it cook priced went up he said that's taxes now anybody out there does this make sense i know it's hard right now but i respect honesty not bullcrap! C'mon keep it real< /text>

Gomo's is the best fish I've had from any fish market that cooks fish. Everyone that I have referred to go there has loved it. And I believe that if you try it you will too.< /Review>

<review>Absolutely love their friend seafood. And for my people's they accept E.B.T cash & food cause you know ain't no party like a E.B.T party cause a E.B.T party got shrimp. They aren't super salty like Louisiana fish. The customer service is whatever and the food take about 15 minutes to be done. I hope you all enjoy.</review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x80c2b71ca1bc57c3:0x8ff1b87cff2d8910<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

< review>
This is the best fish on this side of town. The fish is well seasoned without being salty. I don't usually like filet of sole, however, there is something about their filet of sole.  It is delicious. The french fries are good too.  I get them with no salt. I haven't had much luck with the other sides, but I'm very picky. I think my husband said the greens were good there. My husband loves the catfish and orange roughy. They also have sanddabs and they grill fish too. The tartar sauce is made in house and is very good.  If you like tartar, make sure you get extra.  There is an extra charge though.  Don't be put off because it is a hole in the wall kinda place, as most fish markets are.  The kitchen is very clean and they have an A rating.  I almost forgot the jumbo shrimp....mmmmmm good!< /review>

< Review>
I checked into this motel a little after 9pm on a Thursday night. After ringing the front doorbell I was greeted by a nice older gentleman who checked me and my brother in. Upon entering our room with 2 beds we noticed a roach box next to the TV. I used the toilet and when I flushed the chain fell off of the set up inside the toilet tank. I had to stick my hand into the water of the tank and reconnect the chain ao that it would flush again. I then went back into the room and as I was getting ready for sleep I saw a roach on the wall above my head board. After killing it and pulling the sheets back I was able to get some sleep. Not a horrible stay but would've preferred a non smoked in room, no roaches and a working toilet.</Review>

<text>Cozy, clean, great price. The Los Banos Hotel, under new management,  was a clean and inviting place for me during a rather difficult time.  Upon moving to this town in Jun of 2009 for work I had no place to live and was trying to buy my own home.  With limited funds I ended up at this hotel and was not only given a great deal on the room but the staff went out of their way to make my stay better.  Clean room and bed that was cleaned meticulously every day while I was working.  Nothing beats getting off work and having a fresh and clean room to come to.  I would highly recommend this place to the weekend traveler or people looking for a longer stay.</text></record></dataset><record>

Room smelled like somebody smoked in there and the blanket smelled like that as well. Towels smelled washed, but should be switched because they had stains on them. People were noisy in the parking spot. Owner was very friendly though! Wifi- connection was really slow.<//review>

< review>
VERY NICE AND CHEAP!!! my room was all machy in a palm tree theme down to the sheets, had a large bed, clauset with ironing board and iron and lots of hangers, a writing desk with chair and drawers, tv, a large dining-like table and couple chairs, small fridge, a bar-like sink and counter with microwave and coffee maker, standup bed lamp by the bed. I WOULD RENT THIS AS A STUDIO APARTMENT,ITS SO NICE! Lots of space, parking lot very clean. Was told there's a laundry here too. Paid $44 flat!!!</review>

She threatened to beat me up and put me in the hospital... while i was speaking with the female who runs the place asking if she knew there had been a police officer ringing the bell looking for them..  I closed the door and called the police on Kim which an officer had said to. . the husband came out and knocked loudly on my door. he thought i was mad at him, I was not.  praise God i was on the phone with the Police at the time he was yelling at me.. so funny. a female from India had been thrown out by him and had called the police on him.. i did not know that.. but funny ..
i was Just told to go to my room and stay there by the person from East India when i was standing in the door.. talking to her husband and she about the abuse. the thing is that the person staying in room 112 for the last year likes to rage on her victims.. which i am while i was standing in the door trying to talk to the husband..

I was asked by the Judge in Monterey why i could not press charges in 2010. now they know.. .

when i first got here kim told me she felt sorry for the people from India because they had bought the motel with out the right paperwork.
los banos pd said they were concerned for my safety on March 3rd. with reason.  i asked the city for help after i was laughed at because i knew nothing and could not afford an attorney by the Husband ...the city came over that day telling them to get an attorney . they have... believe me i did not and do not have any information.. but the city does. the people from India laughed at me because i have no information and  because i can not afford an attorney ... because of what happened to me in 2010
the judge said the woman here's finger prints were found in the room and he wanted to know why she had what i was to receive.. i do not know. my skull had been crushed but sadly at that time i was not able to do anything.. but cry ...

A Monterey Judge said no one can buy anything of mine unless i knew i owned it and approved of the sale.. he ordered everything returned to my dad's estate... He told me to get an attorney but i can not since i have no money and no proof.

the people who are running the place do not really care at times about the guests.

there have been people who have left here so upset.. they were told they could not have towels for the room..because the illegal's who had the room before took the towels..(i swear to God) they changed rooms and were told they could not have clean bedding. she will gladly give you your money back rather than provide a clean room..
i have seen 8 illegals or more sharing a room. there was crack being smoked.
a police officer came over to get a pipe. my safety was threatened by the man who said i had to take him to court over this place, I better NOT have called the cops.. i was ordered not to call the cops at all. for any reason.. kim could call a cop. not me. .
it was made clear that i am expected to sign over what ever.. or kim will take care of it.. a mental case will make sure i sign the documents.. or else..
she has sat outside for a month trying to get me to fight with her.. that knowing that i was told not to get upset by medical pros because of the brain damage in 2010.
law enforcement said they recorded death threats, against the Judge and Myself.

i never leave the room..

the place can be nice.. if the city takes it over it will be a Great place to stay</Review>< Pictures>

I couldn't be more pleased with the work that was done, the staff, and the attention to details that Quality provided. The work was done ahead of schedule and my vehicle looks like new - perfect. The Thank -you note that was signed by the staff says a lot about Quality. I will be back to have other work done. Thank you to everyone at Quality.   Brian<//text>

How lucky am I to have found Quality Body Works?! This past summer, my car was unfortunately hit on the side and the door didn't close well. I called Quality Body Works from a recommendation from a local friend. From the first moment I called to the point of driving my repaired car home, this business has provided the best customer service, well beyond my expectations. Doug not only understood my complicated situation with the damage to my car, he also took care of everything, and I mean EVERYTHING with my insurance company. He reassured me repeatedly that things would work out with the insurance...and they did! He also saved me a huge amount of money on finding door replacements. The two doors looked practically brand new at a fraction of the cost. And what about the work on my car? I can say that the investment paid off -- it looks amazing. Everything was assembled well and the paint was blended flawlessly. I am so happy to have my car back!

TL;DR: Quality Body Works is the best body and collision shop you will ever find. Doug and his team are true professionals, and I highly recommend their shop to fix any damage to your car.<//Review>

<Text>I can't express how amazing Ross and the entire Quality team are! I had a gnarly scratch on my front bumper and wanted it fixed before I left on a road trip to visit my parents. I submitted photos for Quality's online quote and their team got back to me the same day! Ross had me bring my car in the same day to better assess the damage. This is my first car and my first time dealing with an insurance claim and auto shop, and Ross made me feel so comfortable throughout the entire process. He was an advocate for me in dealing with my insurance company (Geico made the process difficult), always kept me in the loop of what was going on, and made sure I knew my rights as a Geico customer to be fully reimbursed for my out-of-pocket expenses. Ross also made sure to get my car fixed within my short notice schedule (about 1.5 weeks) which was amazing! The team who fixed my car did an excellent job, it looks like a brand new car!! They even left a bottle of car paint for touch ups, and a hand written note with a gift certificate when I picked up my car. I'm SOO happy with the quality, care and professionalism that Ross and his team showed. They will be the team I go to in the future and I would recommend Quality Body Works to anyone!!< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>{'time': 1621956548478, 'text': 'Hi Danielle!\n\nYou can always count on us going the distance for you.

YES! YES! YESSSSS! This place is THE PLACE for anything and everything for your vehicle. The two WONDERFUL ladies (Amber & Liz) up front are always very welcoming. My car has been repaired by them on two separate occasions and both times have been nothing but a breeze. They communicated with me throughout the repairs making it such a stress-free experience. I will definitely say that it was nice knowing my car was being taken care of by the best. Every one of their workers are genuinely all about getting vehicles back to their original state (and even more). Give them a call today, you will not regret it!< /Review>

There is not much else to say but excellence! My fiancé and I are traveling out of our Sprinter Van and ran into some major damages on the undercarriage of the van. Thankfully we came across Quality Body Works, Liz and Ross were incredible to deal with. Parts came in exactly when they said they would and the work was done quicker than expected. Full transparency through out the entire repair on what was going on, and when all was said and done we couldn’t be happier. DO NOT HESITATE to go to these guys, family owned and they should be proud of it.<//Text>

I needed some front repair work done to the frame of my car so that it could pass the brake and light inspection that it previously failed. Since I only had 30 days to do a retest, I was extremely worried that I would not find a shop to be able to do the work in time for me to pay my registration. When I called, Doug said he would take a look at my car and that he was sure that he could squeeze me in. Sure enough, I was able to buy my parts and get into the shop the very next week. The customer service (Doug especially) was awesome, and the end results were quite pleasing, though I had a few slight concerns with other parts of service.

My two concerns were:
1. I was never given a quote for how much the work would cost. I was kinda shocked at how much it was went I went to check out, but saw the cost breakdown and it made sense afterwards, but still left me reeling a bit (especially as a poor college student)
2. They had taken the panels of the sides of my trunk to put in my new brake/tail marker lights but never put them back on, so I had to re-install the panels

Overall, the work was really good. I saw immediately that it looked 10x better in the front than before. And I was able to pass my re-inspection with flying colors. Thanks again, Doug and team.<//review>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>I recently had work done here on my 2019 Prius Prime. It was a small job involving a bracket between the back fender and bumper. I arrived one day and was helped by Liz. She was fast, confident and personable. She provided me with an estimate and even called Toyota to make sure that the part information and pricing was up-to-date. After deciding to choose Quality Body Works to do the job, I called Liz back to give her the go ahead. Again, it was a quick interaction with little effort on my part. We scheduled a time for me to drop the vehicle off. Liz was flexible with me when I had questions about changing the date/time. On the date of service, Liz was there to check me in, which was a very quick process. The work was completed in about the same time they estimated. Picking up my vehicle was also hassle free. The bummer/fender misalignment was fixed and looked like new. I recommend this business because I found Liz to be transparent and easy to work with. I appreciated that she respected my time by keeping the check-in and pick-up processes time efficient.<//Review>< Pictures>

They were happy to give me a ride to work when I dropped off my vehicle and the work was completed in a little over an hour.  It was just a partially detached bumper, but I had heard plenty of stories about how much just fixing a bumper could cost.

<text>Amazing experience! Highly recommend! Professional staff, incredibly friendly and helpful with all of my questions, patient and kind customer service. This business goes above and behind, taking responsibility for errors (if rarely they do occur), however in my case they did a phenomenal job, fixed my fender bender after my car was hit, even keeping it within reasonable price per customer request.<//text>< pictures>

<Review>Ross was extremely helpful and professional! I came to their shop with a huge scratch going down the side of my vehicle. Ross gave hiqqs honest opinion on how to repair the scratch!! Plus by listening to his advice, I saved tons of money. My car looks new again. I am very thankful for the excellent customer service and quality of work that was done on my car! Thank you. I also recommend your shop to all of my coworkers. Thanks again Ross!</Review>< Rating>

<review>Had a little of a miscommunication about my drop off date and my repairs took a little longer than they expected but they gave me a loaner car and some coffee gift certificates for the inconvenience so it was no big deal. Besides that the repairs turned out great my car looks much better now and the price was on par and actually slightly cheaper than some other shops in the area. I was overall very satisfied and would recommend this shop for body work!</review>< pictures>

They did an excellent job. Turned my car in on Tuesday and they had it back to me by Thursday.  Not only did they do the repair and paint job superbly, but they also vacuumed out my car, cleaned the matts and had it smelling brand new.  I was blown away by that!!!  Great place to get your auto body work done.  Front desk gentleman was so helpful and very customer friendly.  Was a great experience all the way around.  Thanks Quality Body Works.</Review>

<Review>I highly recommend Quality Body Works. They are perfectionist in their work, personable, friendly, and fair.  They did work on my 2007 Rav4 after an 18-wheeler backed into my front end at a stop sign.  You can't tell it was ever damaged.  Also, I was highly upset that my Rav4, in perfect condition prior to the accident, would never be the same.  They actually made it look like new.  They also were understanding and worked directly with my insurance company so all I had to do was sit back and wait until the work was completed.  Good job guys and gals.  Thank you.</Review>< pictures>

Quality Body Works has now worked on my vehicle twice over the years.  Their professionalism and attention to detail are next to none.  Each time, the vehicle has come back to me looking just as good as when I picked it up from the dealership.
The paint, in my case a 3-stage pearl, is matched and blended flawlessly.

I highly recommend this body shop, you won't be disappointed.<//review>

<rate>1< /rate><text>Went in for an estimate. The owner was extremely rude. I asked if I would be charged a higher rate if I wasn't going through my insurance company and he gave a vague answer of no not necessarily. When I asked him to clarify what that meant he told me that he's not the right shop to do the job. Awful, business practices. Whatever you do stay far away from the shop it's quite obvious that they are not a good shop to do business with. From asking the man more questions I eventually found out that he does charge more money to customers that are not with insurance agencies that he normally works with. He was then further rude and I left. Beware!! You will likely get ripped off here.<//text>< Pictures>

<response>{'time': 1502744130371, 'text': 'Hello, Miss Anonymous...\n\nI"m afraid you are very misinformed about how the insurance repair is done.  We write an estimate using Insurance Industry agreed upon rates for the work needed to repair your vehicle; however, it is an "estimate" based on what we can visually see without tearing your vehicle apart.\n\nIf we find something we could not see during our estimate, then we submit what is called a supplemental to the insurance company and, if they agree with us that it was caused by the accident, then they give us approval to repair at what is now a higher cost.\n\nWhen pressed with specific questions without actually doing the repair, we can not give concrete answers.   We have been in business for almost 40-years and are in great standing with customers, many of whom have come to us multiple times throughout their lifetime, and have repaired vehicles for nearly every insurance company still in business.\n\nYou may contact us anytime without fear or the need to hide behind a pseudonym.

<rating>5</rating><review>Wow.  Impressive!  My body work on my 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee Overland Eco Diesel with Quadra lift was not an insurance claim, but operator boo boo!!  Not only did Bo come to my place of work to take photos and prepare the estimate, he was more than helpful on the discussion of claiming insurance or not.  The estimate was transmitted electronically, which i LOVE, and was very professional and thorough.  And i felt the price was more than fair for the work required.   He offered a loaner but i chose to rent thru Hertz.  They have a great symbiotic relationship i learned, as not only was Hertz already at QBW to pick me up when i dropped my girl off, but 2 days later i was able to leave the rental with QBW who then called Hertz to come and get it!   My car...let me say that she looked brand new!   Can't even tell where the scratches were, AND they touched up some other minor ones i didn't even ask them too!  She was washed and waxed and vacuumed as well!  Cherry Cruiser looks brand new again..and smelled great!  I will use them again if ever needed!</review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>{'time': 1524266518981, 'text': 'Hi, Suzanne!\n\nYou can always count on us going the distance for you.

This place is awesome, best service and food. There's no more noodle dance due to Covid but the manager passed us by and decided to show us his exclusive skill because he's that nice! We had a little trouble with our stove not turning on but they made it up by giving us free broth. I love hotpot and I love Haidilao. Good job and thanks to all the staffs keeping up with all the crazy customers during this tough times.<//Review>

SUBLIME experience.
Came here two Saturdays in a row and had the same waiter. Both times had an amazing experience and the food tastes great. Recommend trying out the classic spicy, miso, and the tom yum soups. It is a little expensive but I think this is the place to go for celebrating special occasions for both the experience and the food.<//review>

<review>The best service in a restaurant in a long time possibly my life

I ate at with a family that has servant's and a personal chef and this was better service.

Banging hot pot as well. 6 bases to choose from. Great selection of veg and meats to dunk. Complementary edimami oranges plus continued to fill up soup and let us take home base after another fill up

< Review>
The food is good.
What i liked the most is the safety precautions they took.
From something as trivial as getting a plastic cover for headbands to small plastic bags for your masks , i felt very safe . The service was amazing and attentive.<//Review>

Incredible food and even better service. The waitress gave us complimentary hand sanitizer to take home, hair ties, a pouch for our masks to not get dirty, bibs, tea, an edamame appetizer, clementines for dessert and mints. On top of that, she always made sure our hot pot and water glasses were full. Could not recommend this place more!!< /review>

The best service ever, always with smile. Not to say the food quality, especially you can enjoy up to 4 soup bases at one time. iPad ordering make things much easier.</review>

<text>Omg...What a great idea for a hot pot restaurant. You pick your choices from menu.
They bring the broths you chose later dishes to cook. Meanwhile there's a area for your choice of appetizers and pick out your dipping sauce.
Sauce meaning many varieties of flavored oils, sauces, chopped garnishes and the like.
After dinner, go back to area for a choice of a few desserts. They're so sweet. Before cooking, they provide a apron and plastic bag for cell phone.<//text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMumSLBVsBklKAU8hm0-IXk5xaRKQ36FG46SNKw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMJ6KeG5fi0dgATPNZh93HqqMauoq3NJsuhaQwl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN1h20bbPpTiLTWxVy0P705HXtFr1fOcfMks04g=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOVifICBa87M75JLKbjGvLcIEoTOEL-vqGCqBg7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPXnV2e9592Q5_snn_rDjfgjpYGTQcgwhCFxEd4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOD4equRNzWVDPS03xn6ZSbJEwEGmZUm82e2hJ-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMg7xWdfVW2VDtTBip3B85i875TX90N_469GP2w=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPA0ur_8oexNxydt8XvVqTk7KWnaaM6odcvjyIf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOXT5on7rseY5yFmfaS22SU-PytUpQR71Jsm2kr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< Response>

Food was decent but pricey. Free salad, sauce, shrimp chips, and fruit bar with Chinese dessert. Soup base is a separate cost from the hotpot items. Lunch special combos get sold out early. Everything else is expensive. Ordered the special handmade noodles which comes with a show. The noodle puller does a dance with the noodles. That part was cool and the noodles were good!< /review>

Wow. Just wow. Incredible service and extremely flavorful broths. My first time here tonight and I wasn't exactly sure what to expect. This place delivered flavor, service, and everything I needed for a chilly evening out.

Our server was all over it. He helped us with sauces, he gave us amazing suggestions, and even put together his personal favorite dipping sauces for us to try.

They end the meal with a bowl of beef, green onions, and/or cilantro so you can scoop the soup into your bowl and enjoy it as a soup! If you're like me and aren't a fan of cilantro, you can enjoy the bits of beef with your broth.

My water cup was never empty because they were always checking on us and making sure everything was refilled. This is amazing in and of itself, because typically these self service food restaurants would drop the food off and you'd never see them again, but our waiter was always there when we needed him.<//review>

From soup base to various ingredients you want to put in your hot pot. I thought the quality would be better considering how much it cost for a plate of meat. But I guess my expectations were too high. Overall it wasn't bad.

They are for sauce!!! Who does that!!! The meat isn't marinated. If the meat quality was better then sauce wouldn't be need.< /Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN81MgAguUpmxydNlMWEuUSlokiFm6SmpDRCZ_G=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNWEIMlqXOkmjKQAU5Bea18HGxRQNhn8Fl9guur=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPBMPLsXIs1LZCC-OGV0slZ0lXx3dn3jFmLh6Lc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< response>

<Text>Prices are decent if you order a combo. But that may not include everything you need. Once you go al la carte to include everything you want, it can get pricey. However, the ingredients are very fresh and great service. They give you apron to protect your close, ziplock for your phone, and band for girls to hold up their hair.</Text></record></dataset><record>

Excellent service. They provide you everything to give you the best eating experience (hair tie for girls, ziplock bags to cover your phone, tissue wipes for your glasses...). The sauce bar has so many sauces that you con customize your own or make one as their suggestions. The broth is good, we tried 4 flavors but my fav one is the tomato based broth. Good presentation and funny experience with the dancing noodle.</text>

<review>We used to visit this place frequently as it is in the heart of a nice Irvine shopping center.
They have plenty of options for meats and seafood and the bar area has many choices of veggies and sauces.
The also offer you a wide selection of soup bases.

The reason why we stopped coming here is because they started charging for things that used to be included in the (already pricier than normal) tap.
The soup bases suddenly required an extra $3 - $6 depending on what you choose.
The salad bar suddenly came with an extra upcharge as if veggies are super expensive.
The portions of the meats started to shrink while raising the prices across the board.

At this point, there are way too many similar and cheaper options available in Orange County.
It was fun while it lasted.</review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPxiPgkBy5g4Eeg8IudZMiFD1O9Ft79CdOVed7I=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNqKDNcrVsSBoUduOhHSW9Hsyq3lIby41x5Sava=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMAvQ-F8Uo3knBByf0pTPCsxCwxkobPDd5MriXU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< Response>

<Review>I have been to the Hai Di Lao Arcadia and this one is pretty consistent with the overall quality of the Hai Di Lao name. I feel like you can never go wrong with any Hai Di Lap location as their meats and various ingredients are always top notch. They also gave me a fruit plate, a jar of their sauce/paste and a book mark as a present when my friend mentioned it was birthday. Quick tip: you can join their waitlist on Yelp so you don't have to wait too long when you arrive there.</Review>< name>

<Text>The service and quality of food is excellent!! I would say Haidilao has number one service for Taiwanese/ Chinese restaurant. Dintaifung is on the second compared to Haidilao. We enjoy having dinner gatherings at this location. The staffs are really attentive. Thank you Robert and Hunter for taking care of our table for a special birthday dinner.

We got filtered spicy, mushroom, tomato and water base. There are other delicious options! The dancing noodles are must get -- comes with a performance and the noodles are so fresh. In two mins you have chewy noodles. I usually like to get frozen tofu, fish ball with egg roe, Napa cabbage, bean curd, fish cake, and Angus beef.

Many sauces to customize to your liking. I usually like the seasame sauce with green onions. The sauce bar also has potato salad, edamame, tomatoes, melon and desserts.

Highighly recommend making reservations beforehand -- it gets busy after 6pm.< /Text><userid>106538710158412913945<//userid></record>

<text>Our favorite OC hotpot restaurant!

With all the staples, but also some unique items and proteins for the more adventurous eater.

Friendly service, great broths and up to four choices per table! Green pepper is a must-try.

Looking forward to the next visit already.<//text>< Pictures>

<text>Level of service is astoundingly good. The hostess was super polite while we waited for our turn, they offer hot and cold drinks while in line, and candy and snacks. Once you’re seated, they had tablet menus with pictures and explanations. And the wait staff are extremely professional like they all graduated from hotel service school. Meat, seafood, mushrooms, and all the fixings are high quality for the price. I recommend getting g the double soup, with non-butter spicy and bone broth. And get all the combo platters - great value. Top notch experience.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x80dcde9cfef2f75d:0x4861bc4a2ed8b94f</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Absolutely fabulous staff!! Great experience, the meat quality is great from both sides of the price spectrum. All of the broths are delicious, seasoned to perfection and they are always available to make sure you have everything you need.

My new favorite place at this plaza!!! (Many great choices here)<//text>

Snack bar for waiting.  Good food with lots of sauce options, friendly service.  Dinner mask dance show and a prize after dinner from spinning the wheel.  What a fun place to eat at!  You can tell they really care for and appreciates their customers.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

Hot pot style cooking.  Lots of choices for broth, meats, veggies.  All you can eat of the little appetizers.  Free kids meal if you want it, with your adult meal.  Spicy options abound.  Make your own sauce for dipping.  The restaurant is large, split into two suites.  The restrooms are well kept and stocked with more than the usual accoutrements.  Good for kids.  Everyone gets an apron.  Even the napkins are nicer than the usual.  The waiting area outside has seats and snacks, as well as complementary drinks.  We even caught the traditional Chinese dancer show in the evening.  The server was great, fast, and thoughtful.<//Review>

Haidilao was one of the best restaurant experience we have ever had. The service we had from Kenny was great. He helped us choose and put together a set of incredible soup flavors to cook our food choices in. We were newbies to this and he made it very easy for us. Ivy , one of the managers , also helped us and was making sure our experience was superb.  When you go ask for the the dancing noodle.  You'll love it.< /text>

<text>The servers were very helpful! They answered our questions, gave us guidance, and the amenities were the cherry on top! They have toiletries in the bathroom, passed out gum at the end of the meal, and the manager stopped by to chat at the end of our meal for feedback. Great atmosphere!< /text>< Name>

I came here with my mom on a Thursday night and we had such a wonderful experience! Everyone we interacted with was incredibly warm, cheery, and helpful and we were seated right away at a cozy booth in the back. The food was delicious, they offer aprons and hair ties, and they even had some entertainment (unexpected but delightful)! The noodle dance was real tableside treat that was well worth it too. We'll be back!<//Review>

Since it's not all you can eat, the food quality is much better than the typical all you can eat hot pot places. It is also quieter and cleaner.  But be careful as you pick different items, they add up quickly.  You can also pick up to 4 soup base. Again, each soup base has different price.< /text>

Always a great experience at Haidilao. My favorite is always the sauce section, since you can take as much sauce as you want and customize it yourself. How great is that? If you need recommendations for the sauce. I personally LOVE LOVE LOVE these 2 combinations. First is beef sauce + fresh garlic + sesame oil and second is satay sauce + sesame sauce + a bit of fresh garlic. My favorite item on the menu has to be the fish ball with fish roes in them. They are amazing and they explode as you bite into them, so really, if you don't like them, something is wrong with you haha</review>

Good interactive service. Very strong stock base. It was my first time having hot pot at midnight that I think I shouldn't have. I slept that night and woke up with the same taste in my throat.
I think People come here for the package. The boba next door, long line still in the pastry shop right before mid night 12 and KTV that closes way pass that time.

Crawling through groups of night owls standing outside each shops late. I feel the spontaneity of the late night exploration doesn't make me feel young anymore but the evening fresh air and a few doses of rain drops makes me feel refreshing and special.</text>

My husband and I went to Haidilao in Irvine today, the very first time. The food was delicious but most important was the staff. They are super nice, especially the manager, Mr Wang, the host, Daniel and our waitress (too bad I forgot to ask her name). During the meal, they have the fun performance which make the dinner so much enjoyable. I heard lots of good things about them. Well it is so very true. Strong recommended.  We will go back for sure :)<//text>

Been here twice and have to say this is the best in Irvine. Everything is so fresh and the side bar has so fresh fruits and soups. Kids get a free kids plate. Highly recommend the tomato soup broth.  Service is top notch and gives lots of advice and suggestions.<//Text>

As a semi-vegetarian person, I can confidently say they've great variety in soup bases and plates/dishes. Also having a good spice tolerance, I can also confidently add that the spicy soup base is killer spicy. If you have mid to low tolerance, this is numbing. Flavorful yes, but numbing.

Parking is common to all shops in diamond jamboree and fills up rather quickly. These guys always have a wait list too. So make sure you call in and reserve a spot on the list.

Also yelp check-ins give great deals like free juices.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

Impeccable service! Not your usual Chinese or hot pot restaurant. We opted for the four palace broth ( mushroom,  spicy pork, pork and tomato). We liked them all with the family's as the tomato and mushroom. The Angus and short ribs were a hit. The help yourself sauces were bomb, with of course my favorites are the mushroom and fried chili. There were fruits and Chinese popcorn for patrons waiting with fruit infused water. The milk tea did not disappoint. We thoroughly enjoyed the meal. We came to check it out, we left with full tummies and happy with the experience. The place is also clean and you're provided with house aprons before you eat.<//review>

Food is yummy, service is great but the wait can be long. It's also a bit more expensive than other hot pot places but you are paying for their service and top quality food.</review>

This place is wonderful. The food is fresh and the atmosphere is inviting. I brought my husband here for lunch one day since he has never experienced hot pot before. He loved it! If you have little ones, they order a free kids meal while you get started on ordering your own.

It was our first time to this location and I have to say, we have been back in the same week since. If you ever meet Michelle, she is one of the sweetest people we’ve met. She was our server and spoiled our little girl with little toys for entertainment. When we came back the second time, she remembered our daughter’s name. We are regulars to several places in the area and even our usual servers don’t even remember our names, let alone our daughter’s.
Michelle, if you ever see this, please know how truly amazing and special you are. Your kindness and thoughtfulness is rare. Your thoughtful towards our nearly one year old will always resonate with us. You’ve set an even higher standard now. Thank you so very much!

The value for the food is great. For those who complain about the price, I’m not sure how since you see the price of what you order on your IPad... my husband and I are foodies. We are small but we do love to eat and what we order fills us up. Great value for the price and it’s always been very clean when we arrive. We live 35 minutes away and can’t wait to come back.

This was one of the most fun and flavorful dates that hubby and I have had in awhile<//text>

Unique Chinese hot pot place with 6 different soup base to choose from (you can even get a pot with 4 different soups). A good selection of ingredients and toppings, a unique hand tossed noodles and good selection at the sauce minibar. Great service through out as well. Only downside is the long wait and it was pretty expensive. Be prepared to spend around 50 / pp< /Review>

I recommend the spicy pork bone soup base. It’s medium spicy but might be too much for people who don’t really eat spicy food. Meat quality is superb!!! The only con is the crowded seating with tables only inches away from each other.</review>

Favourite hot pot in Southern California! The environment is nice and clean. Food is fresh and  of high quality. Service is as good as usual. Customers are provided with drinks,  snacks and toys while waiting. We take out baby there, and they gave my baby a little toy. It's so warm. Definitely will come back.<//Review>

It's better to reserve a table at this restaurant, since a lot of people do eat here and there's a long line, but this place actually has complimentary snacks and flavored water outside for the people waiting for a table here.  The staff is friendly here, place looks clean, restrooms has extra amenities that cater to almost every need (i.e. pads, toothpicks, mouthwash, toothbrush, hairspray, etc.).  Food tastes great and the entertainers were cool.  The only downside to this place is how expensive everything is.  Would still return here though.</Review>

Outstanding services. They have a separate waiting room for customers. There is a station for ppl who is waiting for tables. Lime water, chips, games etc. Once you are seated, they will bring you a cloth apron. Every table has a drawer, inside are plastic bags to cover your phones, wipes to clean your glasses, hair elastics, spoons and chopsticks. Food are so fresh and delicious. Premium meat cuts. Authentic Chinese hotpot soup base. Highly recommend.<//text>

<review>I came here first time with my family on my birthday and it was a Friday. Super crowded but we joined live wait list and saved time! When we came, we only waited a little bit more for the table. Since our wait was more than an hour total, they rewarded us on the fortune wheels that got us a free clam dish value around $10. Freebies always make you happy.

I like the interior with colorful, simple set up yet traditional and modern Chinese vibe. The table set up with drawers with hair tie (girls are all appreciated it just like me), wet wipes for phone screens, and napkin. Love the thoughtfulness! We all die for little details. Moreover, the spoons we used were tiny which allow the soup to cool down when it reached your mouth. Another detailed oriented details! Talking about the food, the pot allows us to order 4 soup bases at a time. My favorites are Mushroom and Spicy Pork soup bases. Veggies, seafood and meat options were fresh. The quality is consistent on other times that I come to Hailidao as well. Salad and fruits were provided at the bar with a lot of sauces that you can mix to use with the hot pot.

The best part is their birthday perks. My mom and sister asked the restaurant to prepare and they didn't fail to surprise us. They brought a 'Happy Birthday' sign singing, a fruit dish with candle and a small gift of a spoon and pair of chopsticks. Very cute and fun experience!<//review><resp>None</resp></record></dataset><record>

<review>Edit: I take my 4 star back. The second time were there the service was not good at all. We had to stand up and refill our ice water 3 times, while the two waiters just kept  chitchatting in the back. I felt no one really served our table except for bringing our food out.

Org review: Always good service. It is a well known thing in China, that haidilao was so successful not because of their food, but the service. Their food is decent, but if you think their food quality should match the line length, you are at a wrong place. (I mean it is hotpot after all. All they need to do is prepare the broth and cut the meet and veggies).</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Date>

Really good hot pot, but it is a bit overpriced. $70 for two people with only water to drink and ordering only one meat and seafood 'double combo'. That's why 4 stars. Great place if you've got the money.</Text>

Pricey but worth it. The short rib meat is my recommendation. The spicy house soup is my go to base.<//Text>

Didn't expect to see a familiar brand of hotpot during my first trip to USA. Food & service is just as great as the outlet in Singapore.<//Review>

Best hotpot restaurant I had. It is expensive but the service was really good unlike most of the Chinese restaurant. It can have a long wait in the busy hours.</Text>

(Translated by Google) The taste is similar to that of Asian, but the soup has been adjusted to reduce the spicyness.
The space is crowded and the price is a bit expensive.

味道跟亞洲的差不多，但湯頭有調整，減辣很多。
空間比較壅擠，價格也偏貴一些。<//Text>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) Awesome experience! I like tomato and butter and spicy bottom of the pot. There is free fruit before meals, seaweed salad, Korean spicy cabbage; Ma group meal and dessert purple rice, not too sweet. Appetizer ordered spicy pig's ears and brown sugar cake. Brown sugar cake is praise! Lamb shoulder, slippery shrimp, fish is also very like. Vegetarian point of ringing volume, melon, white radish, broccoli.

Parking is not good. Parking lot are full. Saturday afternoon around 2:00, even next to the garage are full.

(Original)
非常棒的体验！喜欢番茄和牛油麻辣锅底，三鲜还成，菌菇味道比较淡。饭前有免费水果、凉拌海带、韩国辣白菜；饭后有麻团和甜品紫米粥，都没有太甜。前菜点了麻辣猪耳和红糖糍粑。红糖糍粑非常赞！羊肩、虾滑、鱼片也都很赞。素菜点了响铃卷、冬瓜、白萝卜、西兰花。

就是不好停车。停车场都满了。周六下午2点左右，连旁边的车库都满了。< /Review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) One of the most famous Chinese chain restaurant. Almost provide same services in Asia. It ’s orders not all you can eat. You can choose up to four flavours for the soup. The shrimp ball is the best.

Prawn slippery fat beef is delicious and basically has the same feel and service as the branches in Asia

One of the most famous Chinese chain restaurant. Almost provide same services in Asia. It’s orders not all you can eat. You can chose up to four flavours for the soup. The shrimp ball is the best.

蝦滑 肥牛 很好吃 基本跟亞洲地區的分店有著差不多的感覺以及服務</Review>< Pictures>

<Review>(Translated by Google) This time after eating at Haidilao
Our group of people collectively diarrhea
Pulled to collapse!
I thought I had eaten a diarrhea.
But everyone is diarrhea, it means that the health of Haidilao really has to pay attention. I don't know what caused us to pull so much. I hope that the Haidilao restaurant pays attention to the details. After all, this is a big sign. This time is diarrhea. What is next time? Direct food poisoning? Is it not the most important thing to open a restaurant in the United States?

这次在海底捞就餐后
我们一行人都集体拉肚子
拉到虚脱！
本来以为自己一个人吃了拉肚子
但是大家都拉肚子 就说明海底捞的卫生真的要注意了 也不知道是什么造成我们拉得这么厉害 希望海底捞餐厅注意细节吧 毕竟这么大个招牌 这次是拉肚子 下次是什么？直接食物中毒吗？ 在美国开餐厅 食物质量难道不是最关键的吗< /Review><time>1565637770698<//time>< user_id>

(Translated by Google) There are a wide variety of vegetable meats, and when friends have a birthday, the store also sends a birthday present. There is a Sichuan face change show in the store.

蔬菜肉类的种类丰富，朋友过生日的时候去，店家还送了生日礼物。店内有川剧变脸表演。<//Text>

<review>Really enjoy coming here on a Thursday nights for chill dinner and drinks. Stephanie is the best! Service is fast and awesome. And she checked in right before happy hour was done to make sure I got some extra plates in. The banana bread with ice cream is so good! And the sweet potatoes are the best!<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80d954f4286370db:0x99a7f5a243e393d1</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I like the ambience at this spot. The speaker system can probably use more sub/bass. I wish they had more shows that local bands can play.</text>

Wish I had the fun experience the other reviews had but no. As soon as me and friend walked the older guy bartender was extremely rude and when we showed our military ID so we can order drinks and verify age he said they were fake because they didn't have height, weight, and eye color!? 3 things a military ID has never had and never in my time in has someone not recognized or accepted military ID, so we left and took our business else. Never had such a rude bar experience in my life. If zero stars was a rating I'd give it that.< /Review>

<text>Drinks were good, but a cash only bar shouldnt be a thing in the 21st century. Bit of a rip off in atm fees. Staff will kick you out 15 minutes before closing and will be rude about it.<//text>< Pics>

Best bar in North Park by far. They have cheap well drinks, live music, trivia, pool and a nice dark atmosphere. Staff also goes above and beyond. I accidentally dropped my state tax return check and they mailed it back to me with a Bar Pink sticker 😆< /Review>

From the look and feel of this place, most people think I love it.  Kitschy dive bar with booths, live bands playing, sticky floors, the whole nine yards.  Yet, I'm never impressed with the place.  The drinks are generally good and a decent price.  There is a good mixture of different people who come here, which makes it great for people watching.  But, I still can't put my finger on what's up with this place.< /text>

<Review>Played a show at Bar Pink during our tour with my band MiNX. We had a blast at Bar Pink. Played a Monday and there was a good crowd. The staff is friendly and sound guy rocked! Very nice local band the Razor Nights closed the night. Stoked to see people out to check out live music during a weeknight. Hope to play and visit Bar Pink again!!!< /Review><gmap_id>0x80d954f4286370db:0x99a7f5a243e393d1< /gmap_id><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Date>

Classic locals dive bar with a stage for good local music, including some very good area cover and tribute bands. Also I think nights such as Tiki Tuesday, Movie Trivia.<//text>

<review>They do have good taste in live music.  Too big to be called a dive bar, but just big enough to have a few dozen people dancing when they have really good live music.  A place that is just strange enough to suit the great people of San Diego but not so strange as to scare them away.  A very good place to meet people, quick drink service, friendly staff, always a good experience.</review>< pictures>

No AC. Place gets sweaty when packed. You'll depend on ceiling fans to stay cool, and the wind is concentrated on certain spots on the dance floor. Been here a few times, I do have fun. Last time was on first Friday of the month, when they usually play hip-hop with live DJ. 5 dollar cover charge for those busy weekend days. Can get busy enough that the only single bar can be saturated with patrons so waiting to buy a drink can be 10 minutes. You can play pool, you can dance, you can sit (they have tables)... and you can sweat. I'm sure I'll have fun the next time... albeit with the right people.<//review>

Went here on a Sunday of all days and it was great. Amazing music, not too busy but not empty. The only downer of the night was the bartender, he had such a bad attitude. Treated me and the people we were there with like he just watched us kick his dog.</review>

Downstairs bar and restaurant of Gilt Bar. Came here for a nightcap.

Nice, dark, lively atmosphere. A few people looked out of place, wearing goofy t-shirts and sneakers.

The Library would make for a nice night out with a small group of friends. Big groups discouraged; I think the largest tables seats maybe six at most.< /Text>

I happen to use their ATM machine, and there is a service charge of $2.50, but I saw that i was charged more than once for the amount i withdrew from their ATM.  Just to make sure that there was only one service charge, I called their number to just to specify with them, and see what their Service fee terms were.

A gentleman picked up the phone with a simple "hello", so i wasn't sure if I called the right number and responded back with a "Is this Pink Bar?" His response back was "um.... yeah.." like i was stupid to even ask if this was Pink Bar when I dialed their number.

I then began to tell him my concern and just wanted to check with him how many times they charge the ATM fee, and he response back with "who is this?... machines don't make mistakes..so...."

Hes tone of voice was as if I was stupid to be calling about a machine error, because clearly to him, machines dont make mistakes, EVER.  Also, he picked up the phone as if he did not want to even help me in the first place. I called them before I decided to dispute the charge with my bank because I was sure that it could have been cleared up with the bar rather than making it such a big deal between the bar and bank.

I get that we may have a bad start to our days; however, it does not mean you should be rude to your customers who simply just had a question.< /Text>< response>

Mellow bar until the small stage area lights up! Booth seats, a few tables, but mostly bar seating. Billiards, cheap drinks/beer, along with open space on both sides of staging area means up close viewing and place to dance. Fun neighborhood, cheap HUGE parking structure across street, or street parking on surrounding blocks. Tranist nearby on busy thouroughfares.<//review>

Not usually my type of bar in that it's a bit dark and divey. But I love to see shows there. The atmosphere always provides a good time and the drinks are reasonably priced. Just be aware that it is cash only.<//text>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><review>RUDE RUDE RUDE!!!!! The lack of customer service was incredible and unbelievable! This was my first time attending this bar and at first it was very dark looked cheap and nothing special. I decided to give it a chance but as soon as i sat down I was greeted by a server named Tara, immediately i sensed her negative vibes and she definitely did not look happy to be there. I asked her to give me a minute so that i can situate myself and have a minute to go over the menu as my friend went to the bathroom and waiting for them to come sit so we can order together. I had not even had a chance to take off my coat yet and the server comes back with an attitude and kept rushing me to order so finally i felt anxiety i said i would not be able to order i need another minute. The server immediately suggested i must get up from my seat and move elsewhere for the seating was reserved for those who are drinking. I never walked into a bar and not planned on drinking, its the whole purpose of coming to a bar. I asked her for another minute as i did plan on ordering just hadn't made up my mind and she threatened me with the security guard and said she will have me moved forcefully for not ordering.I haven't even been in there for 5 minutes!!! my mind was blown that i seriously got threatened to be moved forcefully for not ordering. mind you this place was not full and there was another empty booth so its not like i was really occupying any space when there was obviously plenty. I tried to ask for the servers name but she kept walking away from me and purposely ignored me. i tried to talk to the manager and she was equally as rude as her server, unbelievable! My friends and i will never come back to this place again.</review></record>

This is a fun dive bar with live music, interesting decor, good customer service, and affordable drinks. It's cash only which is a slight inconvenience especially because the ATM at the bar never seems to work when I'm there.</Text>

<Review>This was a cute little kitschy bar and the CASH ONLY policy didn't really effect our night, it was easy to get to an ATM and the drinks are easily priced. The thing was, it was a little loud. We were there for a Suicide Girls book signing and finding the girls was hard because there was live music going on. There were people there to see the band AND the suicide girls so the place was packed.

I'm not a bar or nightclub type person. I like to go out and have a good time with who I am with and actually talk to them. I think if I were a single lady with a group of girlfriends this would be a fun place. It was just a little too far out of the way for me and while it was definitely a place with an identity, it wasn't my identity, and that's ok.< /Review>< Pictures>

Don't forget to hit the ATM before you stop in. Great location to see live music. It's divey and intimate with a small riser for a stage in the back corner. Lots of local and touring bands come through. Prices on stiff drinks are cheap.<//text>

< Review>
Bar Pink is the first stop on any self respecting punkers bar crawl the bar is owned by local legend Swami John Reis who you may unremember from such acts as rocket from the crypt, Hot snakes, Drive like jehu, The night marchers, and things his enchanting wife may or may not have called him in anger. Maybe you know him from his radio work or better yet a little show called Yo Gabba Gabba. The Swami is a showman and all around talented devil who features some of the best music you're going to hear in SD. For me, a Bar Pink stop is mandatory before all concerts. A tiki or two, a rousing game of pac man, some good music, good people, goodnight.

*Also bring cash, or the bartenders will try to kill you with their minds.  I think we have time from an evolutionary standpoint before one of them develops telekinesis. Just play it safe.< /Review>

<Text>Service is hit or miss. The bartender got in my face after I asked him to make me a drink 'off duty'. Apparently that wasn't the thing to do because moments later the bouncer was hauling me off the floor with an arm tied behind my back. Ordinarily I'd have complained, but somewhere between both bouncers threatening to 'kick my ass' and a bartender who refused to make a drink, I guess I just lost interest.< /Text>< Pics>

<review>Bar Pink is an eclectic mix of elements. Located right in the heart of North Park. It has a dive bar vibe and showcases a wide genre of live entertainment (jazz, Hawaiian, etc.) They are known for their Tiki Tuesdays which sometimes have live music. Try their signature Sneaky Tiki. They also have pinball.</review><gmap_id>0x80d954f4286370db:0x99a7f5a243e393d1<//gmap_id></record>

<review>First time been here, I went to the bar and I order three beers for me and my friends to the bartender with a tattoo on her left arm; so I ask her for three beers of the brand of Stella after that she went and take the order of 5 more people and give the drink right away, following that she went and have a drink with another bartender and ignoring me, after 30 minutes approximately I ask her again for my three beers and she told me that she didn't like my attitude so she doesn't know what to do about it so she wouldn't bring my drinks and walk away, and I thought she was kidding and I ask the next girl if I heard right and she told me yes that she said I should smile more... I mean really? Should I have to kiss the ass of the bartender for a drink that I'm paying for? I was not even rude I just order for the drink what else should I said? I mean honestly with the music you barely heard and ask for a drink. I think that was rude of her, and unprofessional, she should not  take personal if I didn't flirt with her or smile to her went I ask for a drink. I have to ask for a friend to order the drink cause she was absolutely refusing to give me a drink, it was ridiculous.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x80d954f4286370db:0x99a7f5a243e393d1< /gmapID></record>

This "dive bar" was an excellent place to meet up with an old punk rockstar to see him perform, Chris Doherty from Gang Green, and to find a GREAT new band, called DethSurf, both who are pictured in my review. (DethSurf's singer and guitarist are pictured with the "kiss" paint on their faces). The clientele were nothing but creative people everywhere, musicians, photographers, artists and rock label entrepreneurs. I was waited on by an excellent bar staff and felt right at home for some reason, as everyone there wanted to buy me a drink. Good to go for great music and killer peeps. Not douchey at all! Thanks San Diego, you never disappoint.<//review>

Its been a while but i stoped in here once and got borderline insulting service. It wasn't night yet but they were open, and you could tell the bartender hated to deal with just a few people wandering in for a drink.</Text>

<text>Awesome little dive bar. Ive never paid a cover and have seen many DJs and live bands here. Drinks are super cheap even if you have to wait a bit to get them. Cash only but theres an ATM inside for your convienance. Gets packed quickly and getting passed the dance floor is always fun.<//text></record>

Just wish they would accept credit cards here. Otherwise great hole in the wall bar, not too trendy and a casual atmosphere.</review>

< Review>
Favorite dive bar in North Park. I discovered this joint back in 2008, and it hasn't change much. Great craft beer selection (and cheap macros if that's your thing, they got $2 tecates and $4 PBR tallboys!) and their specialty cocktails are off the chain - I suggest you try their signature Sneaky Tiki.

If you decide to venture in, check-it out on a Friday or Saturday night. They usually have local bands that get the crowd dancing and howling. On off nights, I find that Monday and Tuesday are usually the best days to find local entertainment.

Since I been going to Bar Pink, I can't think of a night that I have been disappointed. I recommend getting a group of friends together to bar hop to the near by Office Bar or U31 to make it a fun night.<//Review>

We drove over an hour to a free show then the bouncer tried to charge us 5 to get in. Then physically threatened my boyfriend and told him he couldn't get in with that hat on.  Guess he hates vans of the wall. Waist of time and money. We will never go back to this place ever again. I am convinced that this guy was ROBBING US AND GARY!</Review>

< review>
This is both a day use and camping spot.  I’m unclear of the prices as nothing is posted at the entrance.  The gentleman at the entrance charged us $4 for each adult and $2 dollars for kids older than 5. Nevertheless, it was worth the charge.  Cash only. Pets are welcomed.
The park has picnic tables, porta-potties scattered throughout. Some spots have grills as well.  There is a lot of fishing going on and overall people camping in Rv and tents. Oh, fires are allowed.  Definitely worth checking this place out.< /review>

<review>To the owner,
Please stop all the yelling, no one is harassing you, the voices that you hear are not real, please seek medical help, it makes it very unpleasant to hear you yelling obscenities all the time especially when children are around. Please stop it. I understand that what you have is schizophrenia and that the voices that you hear sound very real to you but everyone is Fresno assures you that they are not real, no one is harassing you, please stop cursing, I understand schizophrenia is something that you can not control but yelling all the time like you do is your choice and you can control that so please be considerate to all the people that are having to listen to you.</review><user_name>darknessofdawn79 Darknessofdawn< /user_name>< Time>

Can get crowded on weekends but if you find a good spot this place gives you great access to the San Joaquin river. Nice spot for fishing, camping, swimming, or bbqing in the river. $4 per person entry.< /Text>

<text>Peaceful, pretty place to camp along a cut-off loop of the San Joaquin River just on the north edge of Fresno. At least it was quiet when I was there mid-week in early October. Grassy, shady areas to camp with picnic tables near the water. Camped 3 nights, only one of those nights were there other people there. Mostly it seems like people go to the other side of this lake, or whatever it is, to fish. Nice respite from cold mountain camping to resupply in Fresno.

The only issue I found was trying to pay. Got there late the 1st night & looked around for some sign about paying or price. There's nothing. No one even came to collect until the 3rd day. I was thinking it was free. It isn't.  Camping cost is $18 per night. Maybe a bit steep for no bathroom just porta-Potty & no water as far as I could tell. But still worth it I think. Still, with no posted camping fee, they could basically charge you whatever they think you could pay.

Bit hard to find. Small handmade sign & it looks like you are driving into someone's yard as you enter area. Not an RV camping place, mostly tent camping.</text><Rating>4< /Rating><userid>117472823435362136534</userid><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNp_5unKtSlkBcfXdiQGTjGd9kGAo0EKjwc3I-S=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMj66ydPXVZO3OduMcpmipy4GbXFcWvI-F0f_1r=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO3H5Kiz9eTd8HA6ZGxeVkbVEkB81lBIJDWpavP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNqeQAwGknAsOHIJnQbXQgZmzSrZSRZbsyDxDyM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< Date>

<text>Great place to get away with family, nice and chill. I like that they replace trach can liners often so it's not over filled and dirty, plus they supply toilet paper and seat napkins at the porta potty.  The owners try their best to make it a decent and friendly environment.< /text></record>

<text>The place is awesome. It's a hidden gem. Porta potties aren't that great but it's just a camp site, right. It's a nice lake, somewhere we can go to just to get away from everything. We are definitely going back<//text><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

<rating>5</rating><text>This place is pretty cool. It's like $4 a person to get in (cash only). But you can bring bbq and beer and whatever else you want, and spend all day here. The back side is against the river, and the front is a little lake. The river is super cold, but it's really fresh and clean water. The lake part is warmer, but the water is kinda murky because of all the sand. It's a really chill place to come and chill with family and friends. Parking and driving through gets a little difficult later in the day with all the cars. There's a port-a-potty in the back at the end of the dirt road, but I recommend leaving and going to the nearest shopping center to use the restroom. Just tell the guy at the gate you're coming back so they dont recharge you. I guess you can also camp here for as long as you want too. There's RVs and tents everywhere.

Overall it's a good getaway spot, not too far, and not too expensive. Perfect for a day trip.< /text><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x80944275d62328d9:0x9c84d82c45d12923< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Worst place to ever fish at, we were not greeted upon the entire, and it wasn’t until 20 mins when a guy that lived in a car came down and kicked us out in a unmanner way. When you first enter the place smells hideous there is an abanded house that a homeless man lives in, HORRIBLE PLACE<//Text>

<text>Great and clean place to stay overnight. Only 21$ / night.
Campfires are allowed.
Camphost is super friendly and cares a lot about the cleanness. Nevertheless there are sometimes people who do not care at all about cleaning for themselves, but the staff does a great job.
We will definetely come back when we're around next time.<//text><Gmap_id>0x80944275d62328d9:0x9c84d82c45d12923< /Gmap_id><pictures>None<//pictures>< Date>

Nice place has lots of shade. Fun for the whole family we have camp overnight without any problem it felt safe. Negative side is the water is not too clean due to the same people that come out to camp and care less to throw garbage in the water. It has portable toilets that are not clean due to again same people that come out to camp and don't take care of them. I would like to see some type of composting toilet system and some rules on how to educate the people about composting toilet. It would help the reduction of flies and bad odor. And please pick up after your SELF!!!! God bless< /Text>

We came there because we needed any campground for 1 night asap. First thing what we saw was some dirty place which looked like a ghost town. So we were a little confused. Then someone told us that we have to pay to the man who lives in a car there which looked even more creepy. We waited like 15 min for anyone but unfortunately no one was there  so we had to leave and book a hotel< /Review>

Reasonable day and overnight rates. A small number of campsites right near the river, with a few more surrounding a small lake/inlet off the river. Helpful employees, just wish there hadn't been so many raccoons at night!</Text>

<resp>None<//resp><rate>5< /rate><text>Very comfy location, Beautiful year round campground. So slide to town but feels like you're roughing it in the country. Clean porta-potties, clean campsites with picnic tables and bbq pits.  Trash cans provided at every site. Pitch your canopy or tent, park your camper trailer or RV (Electricity and water hookup available for add'l fee) swimming and tube floating in the private pond with immediate access to the river.  Kayak rental available (call for availability) No showers available so bring your camping shower and tarp, lol!  Fishermen welcome but must be licensed.  Prices are the best around.  Dog friendly... ByoPooper Scooper and bags.  The Beach is open year round unless it is time to trim down trees or deep clean after a busy weekend or holiday. 3 day overnight maximum unless otherwise arranged with the owner.  Owner and Caretaker are on site to assist patrons and there needs also if you forget to bring camp fire wood they do have some for sale.   Bring your family on a little weekend getaway without having to go too far.  I highly recommend this hidden treasure and my family and I will always return.< /text><Gmap_id>0x80944275d62328d9:0x9c84d82c45d12923</Gmap_id><userid>101509225033707363826<//userid><pictures>None</pictures><time>1549319418460</time></record>

<Review>(Translated by Google) It is a good place to spend a day with the family. The water is nice at this time. They have benches and you can make bonfires. You can fish early in the morning only or if you camp you can do it at night.

{'time': 1511319107334, 'text': "Knowing that some things can get lost in translation, it would help if you would be more clear when you say 'very bad place'.  We're not sure what you mean when you say it's not clean, is there something specific?  If it is the bathrooms, we have no choice but to use portable bathrooms.  Being on the river bottom as we are, we cannot install any type of sewer or septic system to accommodate anything but portable bathrooms, which also means we cannot have any type of showers.  We have always been and will continue to be a primitive camping area.\nWe're sorry you did not enjoy yourself when you were visiting us.  Our many other customers are aware of what facilities we provide and are glad to be able to spend time at the river.  We sincerely hope you find another place more to your liking."}</response>

I can not praise Pete and his team enough. Moving to California was a rough enough transition. Finding a home in California in this competitive market... Talk about a headache that him and his team took on for me. They pulled off the impossible.

First let me start, they respected my right to be an Independent Buyer. I was motivated and on a time line. I came with my pre-approval and made it clear I was Independent. They never pressured me to do business with them, they let me do it on my own. They gained my loyalty by being there.

Next, I am a Veteran with a baby on the way. I believe I earned my right to 0 down home loan. VA home loans are not really zero down. You have to pay closing costs. As you know that can get pretty expensive.

Not only that... I am cheap. They managed to help me find and get a home into Escrow for at $0 cost to me. They worked out for the seller to take on all closing costs. And having a baby on the way, we can use all the money we can get.

Pete and his team did a great job. 5 star service all the way.< /review>

Sheeza is so UNPROFESSIONAL, If she thinks she can auction a house, & ask for the highest bid, makes you think she’s going to finalize everything and take the house off the market then DOESNT take the offer.. a moment later to find out she changed the price of the home as the highest placed bid who is she kidding?! she’s a joke. We are trying to PURCHASE A HOME she says one thing and does completely a different thing.. she plays so dirty, and is unethical.</review>< pictures>

<Review>WARNING!!
Callee Garner and April Vega are the most unprofessional and laziest people I have ever had the displeasure dealing with. If you can avoid Watson's property, I would highly recommend it. They won't answer calls for days even when you reach out several times. They take forever making repairs, leaving you in unlivable conditions. For example no hot water for 6 days, leaks in the walls until mold forms and patching over the mold! When things are repaired it's done as cheap as possible and with very poor quality, usually by a craigslist handyman that I wouldn't trust in my home. They are disrespectful when responding to any inquiries and they will lie about not recieving emails until they are blue in the face. Absolutely the worst experience my fiancee and I have ever had with a property management company and will never deal with Watson as a whole for this reason.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>{'time': 1623093316221, 'text': 'Hello Brandon,\nWe are so sorry to hear you had a bad experience with property management.

<Text>My experience has been very good. The employees were helpful during the application process and during the moving in details. All maintenance has been handled promptly and efficiently. I really like that there are multiple ways to get ahold of someone and the management is very knowledgeable of current laws and regulations for housing. If and when we need to move, we will be checking through Watson again.< /Text>< pics>

April always kept my units rented and kept me informed of issues and always responded to my emails and calls. April had the answers when I had the questions. April I appreciate you and all the things you and your staff did for me.

If you are looking for a good property manager contact April. Thank you April, you are a diamond in the rough.

We just moved from San Antonio TX, and have had one problem after another with other rental agencies, the staff at Watson Realty on Camino Media have been WONDERFUL! Callee was able to get us into a beautiful house with our pups and kids in less than 48 hrs! They have been helpful and polite throughout the whole process! 10 out of 10; I highly recommend this company!!< /text>

<text>So far has been a great Experience. We have had issues but work them out as with anywhere you live! Their job is harder then you all think. I give them a 5 for caring enough when our family needed them.<//text>< pics>

It was a great experience renting from them. As the years go by, it seems harder and harder to get things fixed. I don't know if it's the property owner or the property management.< /text>

< Review>
BEWARE of Watson Realtor Cindy Gilligan Armstrong. She is dishonest and does not keep her word. She was my realtor for the sale of my house. She told me when she listed my house that more realtors would show my house if I brought their commission  up to 6% from 5%. She then informed me that if I would do that she would give me $1000 after escrow closed. She now refuses to pay me the money.

I WOULD FIND A DIFFERENT REALTOR AS THIS COMPANY DOES NOT BELIVE THE CLIENT COMES FIRST. THEY BACK THEIR REALTORS NO MATER WHAT.< /Review>

<rate>1</rate><text>My friend's and roommates bought a house from them in August of 2017,  their realtor Brenda Trujillo didn't even do a walk through to make sure that the repairs that needed to be done were done. The repairs that needed to be done were dry root all-around the home, water damage to the bottom of the cabinets in the kitchen and both bathrooms. My roommates had to replace the hot water heater and two toilets. The home that we are in should not have gone FHA with the problems we have had since we moved in.</text>< pictures>

BEWARE!
The most corrupt real estate company in Bakersfield. They can care less about repairs, will give you the run around for MONTHS. Callee Garner and April Martinez are RUDE, DISRESPECTFUL, & LAZY. Never again.< /Text>

<Text>I’ve been to other Chevy dealerships in the past and have never had a service advisor like Daniel Ortenzio. He really goes out of his way for his customers. He recently called me to go over my recent service and made sure I understood everything I payed for and the discounts I received. The receipts get a little tricky to read sometimes.  I’m now confident bringing my Chevy to Liberty Chevrolet for future service and look forward to Dan being my advisor. He’s one of the best I’ve worked with.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

The better half and I decided we needed a new car, but we don't have time to go car shopping because of our work schedules and the kids school schedules. I was about the just give up on a getting one all together because by the time we get a chance to go and look all the good deals are gone. Anyways, long story short, we saw a car we were really interested in online. I click on it send my information to get a price, and I kid you not my phone was ringing within minutes. We fill out a credit application online, being that it was later in the evening we only got offers from a couple banks. So we decided to wait until the next morning to see what other offers were offered. Accepted an offer on my first break at work, and the car was delivered to me all the way in Madera by the time I came home for lunch. If that's not great customer service I don't know what is. If you're looking for a new Chevy, this is the place to buy! Rene Saldivar was great, and I highly recommend that you check them out. Never in a million years did I think I'd buy my first brand new vehicle online, like who does that ??? Well we did and I'm soooo glad we did. I absolutely love my new car.<//text>

Called other dealerships and they couldn’t get me in for two weeks or more. When I called in and spoke to Dan, I explained my situation he was very accommodating, professional and got me right in. I really appreciate the great service!</review>

Incredible experience all around!  I've been shopping for quite some time for my new baby.  I've been to dealerships all over Central California, searched online, and made countless calls.

Headed home I passed the Liberty Chevrolet at Selma Auto Mall and decided to call.  I spoke with Rene who selected a few vehicles that fit my search criteria.  He even waited passed closing time for me to get back to the area!

I immediately fell IN LOVE with my new 2018 Chevy Camaro 2ss Redline - it's perfect!

We ran the numbers and carefully considered the vehicle.  After a few HOURS of me going back and forth I told Rene I would be back after consideration (and after bank approvals).  He was patient and totally understanding.

Rene answered all of my questions quickly and honestly.  When he didn't have an answer he was prompt to research and get me the information quickly.  He was overall very knowledgeable about this vehicle and several others I'd inquired about.

My experience with Rene and Selma Auto Mall could not be more incredible.  I'm very impressed with the customer friendly attitudes from all staff, the clean spacious customer environment, and their willingness to do whatever it took to make sure I was completely ecstatic with my purchase.

Thank you Rene, and thank you Selma Auto Mall!</Review>

They provide flat screen TV for the customers like myself, but there is only 4 recliners available.. I was informed of my waiting time and what they were doing with my car. When it was done, technician came to me to let me know and what is my next step amd such. I couldn't believe how smooth the car was running, and the issues I had prior to getting the service was fixed. That made me so happy.. I have more issues that need fixing still.. And I've  already decided to return to same servicing center. I'm an one super happy client!! Thanks guys, you guys rock!!!!< /text>< Pictures>

It took almost a week as they held my money hostage and hung up on me several times. I had to threaten litigation and all of a sudden they had my check. If they treat veterans this way, I'd hate to see how they treat their other customers.< /Review><pics>None< /pics><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

Came in for a oil consumption and instead of figuring out were the problem they just added oil and told me to come back. Also gave me a packet of oil burning being normal on a new car.
Will talk to a lemon lawyer very soon.< /Text>

I went in for a oil change and engine light on in my 2019 chevy traverse. I was informed my muffler was cracked at the welds and I was outside on extended warranty coverage.  My service advisor for that day was Dan.  Dan was the man that informed me of the bad news and let me know that there was a slim chance for coverage with one more resource.  He called me the next day to inform that he was able to get it covered. Im a happy customer so far. If it was not covered I would of got rid of the vehicle and never bought a chevy agian. I greatly appreciate Dan and the whole chevy team.< /review>

< Review>
People were friendly, but results were not good.  I had recently taken the vehicle in to my local dealer (Ellensburg, WA) to diagnose a “check engine” light.  After having my vehicle for several days, I was charged $1800.   Driving to California ( on vacation), the “Check Engine” light again appeared.   Taking my vehicle to Liberty Chevrolet, I was told that Windy Chevrolet in Ellensburg had not diagnosed properly.   I declined to have Liberty try their hand at repairs.  I was charged $300.
Upon my return to Ellensburg, Windy Chevrolet charged me another $120 to replace the part that Liberty diagnosed.<//Review>

< Review>
I brought a vehicle in for a prepurchase inspection, and the car was given a clean bill of health. However, there were numerous issues with the vehicle that required fixes such as exhaust leaks, a broken oil pressure sensor ($500), charred wires that were sitting on top of the exhaust manifold, and a nearly broken starter ($600). The first three items should have been identified during the inspection at a minimum.</Review>

People at this dealership just seem to have a spirit of heavyness on them as if to not really want to be there ... unhappy , after the service of my truck it was not reset like it should have been also. I think they lack a bit of integrity. Not sure if I want to keep doing buisness with them.</review>

They didnt even have the audacity to call me back!!..Until I called them them told me they couldn't help me.. Well. Good thing was went to Tranquility Chevrolet and they had me financed in 20 mim with a damn good interest rate!!<//review><username>Adam R<//username>< Response>
{'time': 1600721896542, 'text': 'We\'re sorry that you had a less than ideal experience, but as our Sales Manager has told you on the phone, we never got to the point of running your credit, you called us and said that you were just "shopping around". We\'re nowhere near Tranquility, CA, are you sure you didn\'t mix us up with someone else?  Every time you sent in a request for more information about a vehicle, we would attempt to call/message you back, with no avail.

<Review>I purchased my Corvette here and service all my vehicles here and always have a great experience from Jorge in sales to Dave in service!
I think it’s truly a shame Anthony Caruso had to have all his friends post phony negative reviews on his behalf when none of these people live the Fresno area and most live out of state!
I will continue to do business here and encourage everyone to support local business and not radical out of town cyber bullies!!!</Review>< Response>

This has been the Absolute Best service I have ever received. Gentlemen named Arthur Moreno was very helpful & communicative. The sales manager & Arthur  helped my & my growing family find the perfect vehicle that was safe & efficient for my family. If I ever go hunting for another vehicle, I am very sure to come back for wonderful service. I definitely recommend to all who are looking.< /text>

I went there because I had heard great things.
They never communicated with me about what was going on with my application.  I had to call them several times to get any information to find out they sold the car I had test drove and offered me another car that was out of my price range after I was clear what price range I wanted to stay in. Spoke to a supervisor named Mark Acevedo who became rude after I was trying to ask a question about leaving a review. Totally frustrating, Irritating,  and just unprofessional in my opinion.</review>

<review>Arthur was my sales guy  he went above and beyond to help us. He gave us excellent customer service, was very patient with us and most of all didn’t push us to buy the vehicle, because of him we now own a 2020 Chevy Tahoe. Thank you Art ! One happy customer Angela< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Date>

The sales guy didn't explain to me all my options.
They sell to me options that I don't ask for it.

A week later I have an answer from the owner I guess
so I call back and I have a really unprofessional guy answer me the phone let me know that my deal was done and they can do nothing about it so I ended up with the $45,000 truck and not really happy about it .
if you trying to buy a truck I recommend try different dealers so you can get the best deal.</text>< Pictures>

How had a awesome experience at the Selma auto mall. The sales representative Art  that we worked with was awesome. He was super polite and professional. Made us feel like family. Made the experience of buying a car a breeze. Would highly recommend talking to him about buying a car. Thank you Art and Selma Auto Mall for a great deal and a great car.< /Review>

Took vehicle in for service appt. waited two hours in a freezing waiting room with large screen TV tuned to CNN turned up very loud. I felt like I was being tortured but it was too cold to wait outside. I don’t think they should subject their customers to their political bias. I probably won’t be going back.<//Review>

To be fair $10,000 is actually pretty cheap markup for the corvette. Other dealerships in LA are charging more than that. Should of took it!! The C8 is a hot car and you’re expected to pay over msrp.< /text>

I recently purchased a truck from the selma auto mall and sales rep Art was awesome. They gave me a great price on the vehicle and was able to drive off the same day. This is my third vehicle purchased there and I will tell you they have made me a customer for life. If you're looking for a car or truck look no further..</review>

Art from Selma Liberty Chevrolet was a super nice guy made things super easy to make my trade in not difficult, he did whatever was necessary to make me feel welcomed and that everything I was going to do was super simple. I definitely would recommend to ask for Art if you’re looking to purchase a vehicle at the Selma automall.<//Text>

I had gone 2 weeks before due to my truck announcing it needed an oil changed and i went in the afternoon after work and was not able to be seen because they said we needed an appointment and we had to schedule it online.
Thats the only thing i didnt liked. I do not have a flex working schedule to take the day off to take it. There should be availability for walk-ins & i didnt like the fact appts were soo far out i had to be with out a car for 2 weeks and i also didnt like the fact that i couldnt schedule the appt there the first time i went in and was refuse service since i was in the dealer ship.

But other then that the tech  was really nice and they did a good job< /text><user_id>110600814993861627525<//user_id><Response>{'time': 1601412130375, 'text': "Thank you so much for taking the time to leave us a review!

<Text>I purchased a Camaro here at Liberty Chevrolet today and I had a great experience. The salesperson Enrique was very helpful in my purchase. I had been looking for a Silver Camaro and finally found one here. I recommend coming here if you’re looking for a car.</Text>< Pictures>

< review>
Great dealership. I came in about a Dodge Avenger that was in my budget but ended up not being able to get financed for it but they were able to work with a financer to get me in a Journey that was newer with less miles. Shocked me to get approved for it. Art, Pedro, and Stephen made my car buying a smooth experience. Recommend going there. I'll be back when I finish school and am ready to get into a brand new car instead of a used on.<//review>

We were greeted right off the lot, Art came out immediately as we had already spoken vie phone. He was very professional, knew what we were in the market for and got right to work on trying to get us into the vehicle we wanted. 🤞🏼🤞🏼🤞🏼 Wish us luck!< /Review>

Sammy was very helpful when I was buying my car. He was patient and there was no pressure on me to buy. He helped me find exactly what I was looking for and right in my asking price range. I will recommend my friends and family to come here and ask for Sammy!<//Text>

Had to wait 3 days for it,  than got a call it was ready when really it wasn't did not have any gas nor was it detailed and the scratch on my window was awful. The sales men tried helping me he was great, but he wasn't on the clock when I picked up my car and he wasnt even notified that my car was picked up.

<Review>Our experience with Liberty was amazing. Our sales man Art has such integrity and served us well. He walked us through every step of making our first big auto purchase and was a great source of knowledge. Sammy from finance is so kind and genuine. This team helped us find a family car within our family budget that gives us the confidence that we will be safe on the road and secure in our wallet!<//Review>< pictures>

I had a great experience here at Liberty ...Art our salesman was very no pressure, answered every question we had and showed us any auto we wanted to see. On top of that he was key in getting us the insurance we needed to drive our car home that night! The manager was very professional and very helpful in getting us the deal that made us comfortable and happy. We’d definitely shop at Liberty Chevrolet again! Thank you guys!</text>

<review>Rene helped me find the exact car that I wanted for a price that worked for me. He was super helpful and friendly, didn't try to sell me anything I wasn't interested in, let me test drive any car I wanted, and went out of his way multiple times to make sure I was sure I could see/drive cars. Ended up with a 2018 Elantra GT and he had it detailed and inspected for me on the spot so I could drive home with it.<//review>< response>

Dave offered to have it cleaned for you, but you declined by slamming the door.  And we are sorry about the faulty oil filter, but that was not something we cause.  I'm sorry you feel our service fell so short.  That certainly is never our intention.  Thank you for giving us the opportunity."}<//Response><Rate>1</Rate>< UserId.>

<text>I had a very positive experience buying my new truck here. I don't live near Selma, so I did the majority of communication and prep-work via email with Arthur.  When I arrived, the whole buying process was pretty easy, and Arthur was great at answering all of my questions.  I also got an amazing deal on the truck and they were able to meet my monthly payment goals.< /text><userid>111998085899987807675<//userid><response>{'time': 1558115463404, 'text': 'Thank you Leander for taking the time to write a review, we appreciate your feedback and on your experience at Liberty Chevrolet.

<text>After a very long and stressful week I was not looking forward to getting my wife's car replaced....especially on a weekend. Well it turns out I had nothing to worry about. Our salesman Art, was a to the point guy and told us what we could and couldn't get done. It was no pressure from him unlike other salesman. Not only did he let us drag him all over the lot and sat in a ton of cars we left with a car for my wife and also traded my car in for a more fuel efficient one.<//text><Time>1572032250830<//Time><Name>Jason Leffel<//Name><Resp>{'time': 1572037973382, 'text': 'Thank you Jason for your review.

<pics>None< /pics><Text>The dealership will be your best friend so you can put a 5 star positive review, until there is an issue with your vehicle they do not want to help you one bit. They upsale the seal a jet to you claiming it’s the best. We took it in for it, when we picked it up we noticed 3 large scratches on the truck, we advised the sales manager right away and he said no problem just bring it in and we will take care of it. Brought the truck on & right away they said not we didn’t do that it’s from driving and a rock hitting it, which I find it hard to believe that a rock will hit at the places where it’s scratched. Beware they will sell you a bill of goods but when you have a complaint they will not help you one bit!</Text></record></dataset><record>

Terrible service, sold me a 2919 truck with a transmitían that is no good and do not want to replace the truck. I’ve taken the truck in to service three times first time technicians drive it , I’m assuming the felt the tug while driving because they felt they needed to reboot. Second time I took it in for the same problem that continued, technicians drive it and once again I’m assuming they felt the tug and found the solution went ahead and replaced  the transition valve body. Third time in and the truck is still tugging while coming to a stop and now while accelerating as well. Technicians drive the truck and have no clue what I am talking about they do not feel the tug the truck is fine.</text>

Andrew Farias was my salesman and let me tell you something! He is AWESOME!!! I called in January into the dealership to inquire about a Tahoe that you guys had. I was going through a lemon law case since December and he was keeping me up to date since then and kept contact with me throughout the whole case.  You guys are so lucky to have such a person working for you. Thanks, Liberty for hiring Andrew Farias.</review>

My husband and I have bought a lot of cars but the experience we had buying from Selma auto mall Chevy was the BEST. Everyone was super friendly and worked hard to get us financed even with our recent bankruptcy discharge. They got it done and we got the exact truck we wanted. I would recommend buying from them to everyone. They are who we will be buying any future cars from. Thanks Selma Chevy.< /review>

< review>
The most miserable experience purchasing a vehicle I've ever had! Have purchased 21 vehicles in my life. Wouldn't go back there if they had the last truck on the planet for a dollar. Shopped my loan out to 14 places..got 11 hits on my credit. 6 hours later Didn't have a choice not to purchase because my credit was toast at that point and needed truck for my business the following day. And stuck with a 1000 a month payment. Save yourself some grief go Anywhere else!!< /review>

<rating>1< /rating><text>Recently went in to take my Chevy Cruze to go get an oil change. I had made the appointment online as I had always done previously. When I took my car keep in my that I only took it for an “oil change” yet the mechanics went on further to diagnose my battery and service the other parts of my car. As I was driving home miraculously the “stability track light came on. Previous to this my car had NO ISSUES!!!!!! I’m very frustrated that my car is having issues and it cannot be turned on. My car is fairly new to be having these issues. I took my car to Michaels in Fresno and after the oil change nothing happened to my car. They should NEVER touch any parts of a car that the customer doesn’t request to be touched.

Took my car again after having my car looked at again in January not even 3 weeks into it my car is having issues again of the oil leaking. I find it funny they respond back to other people on here but have not replied to the mess they have been putting me in.  This place is only nice to you when you want to buy a car.</text>< Pics>

This time I worked with Arthur and Renee. They were amazing! Got the same experience as always. If you’re looking for a new vehicle I highly recommend you work with Arthur or Renee at Liberty Chevrolet!

I highly recommend Liberty Chevrolet. They go the extra mile to get you approved for the payments that you’re comfortable with. I highly recommend you work with Mike. He doesn’t pressure you and makes the experience very enjoyable and easy going. Definitely 10/10!< /Text>< pics>

<Review>I wasn't happy with the whole experience. I feel like the sales team were not being as transparent as I would have expected. I do not like playing "games" and that is what it all seemed like. Just be honest and upfront about everything! It was frustrating and annoying how the deal was presented. Art was not bad, he was informative and nice. But Chris came off way too strong and pushy. If I wasn't in love with the car, we would have walked. I was happy with the finance team, both of them were great. And you can't beat the warranties that are offered. But I am not sure if I would go back to purchase another car. Maybe I would in the future if I deal with someone else from the sales team.</Review>< pics>

< review>
TAKE YOUR VEHICLE  TO ANOTHER DEALER.   THIS SERVICE DEPARTMENT CHARGES A DIAGNOSTIC FEE AND DOESN'T APPLY THAT FEE TO THE SERVICE PROVIDED IF YOU HAVE THE WORK DONE THERE.   THE VISALIA DEALERSHIP (ALONG WITH MOST MECHANIC SHOPS) APPLIES THE DIAGNOSTIC FEE TO THE WORK DONE.   I PAID OVER $300.00 FOR A $35.00 PART TO BE REPLACED.  THEY ALSO HAD TO REPLACE MY REAR MAIN SEAL 3 TIMES.  I COULD GO ON, BUT THIS POST WOULD BE TO LONG.   STAY AWAY IF YOU WANT QUALITY WORK DONE.</review>

Me and my husband had a great experience and were taken care of from the moment we walked in to the moment we purchased our car. I highly recommend Art and I want to thank Scottie from finance for everything he did for us. This place has some awesome people who truly take care of all your needs.<//text>

The staff and service at Liberty is always top notch. I bring my car I didn’t buy here because of the excellent service and I know they will take care of it. Very trustworthy and friendly. Brandon and Rob know my well and how picky I am with my car. I can be at ease when it is in their hands. Great service and customer service.< /text>

I dealt  with Arthur at  Liberty Chevrolet,  at 1st, he was typical salesman,  but then he actually worked for me to help me get a deal on the car I wanted, numerous emails, texts, and we were able to finalize the  deal.
ALL ONLINE.
when we arrived, again he was helpful, and made every effort to assist us,
so for Arthur.. a big thumbs up!.
but car was missing a key fob,  ($100 later at local dealer)
also  rear  tires  had abnormal wear , for a car with 4000 miles.'
I suspect at some point , someone had switched  the rear tires,
again $300 later at tire store, and all is good,
SO.  currently I'm waiting for  title paper work  to arrive  in my state, so I can title the car in my name. additionally .. sales tax was collected in calif, and  before I can title the car, my state MUST receive the sales tax, or   I WILL HAVE TO PAY IT AGAIN!
SO,  in general .. Arthur ,  THANK YOU.
dealer......... still waiting  before I make a comment.</review>

I had a horrible experience after I got my truck I was promised certain things at the time of signing and never received them I spoke with the manager Leo and Assistant Juan and came to agreement and was satisfied with what we agreed on and I still have not received what I was promised it’s been 2 months since we spoke every time I speak to them they say the same thing I will call you back in 30 minutes and it’s been 2 months. I will never recommend liberty Chevrolet in Selma  to any of my family members or friends. All I ask for is for the mangers to keep there word since that’s all they have< /Text>

<Text>Mark was an excellence salesman. He was kind, funny, polite, and he did everything he could to help me buy the car. He is by far the best salesperson I have ever come across. Definitely give him a 10/10. But one thing that I did not like was that his manager Chris made it seem like he did not want me to buy the car because he kept saying that "it would not work" whenever we pitched an idea about trying to take home the car. Chris was also giving dirty looks and telling Mark  to just send us home because no deal could be made. If I were to rate Chris I would give him a 1/10 because he just kept telling us no and he did not want to let us test drive. Overall, Mark was a great salesman to me but Chris was not.<//Text>< Resp>

Liberty Chevrolet was awesome! Their service is prime, came in super late to try to purchase a new vehicle and the salesmen helped me without complaints! Walked out with the car i wanted and the process was super quick! Check this place out for sure! Ask for Arthur or Juan!< /text>

Went in to talk prices and they ended up asking for my information so they can pull up my application through my credit union (who already approved me). They ended up checking my credit with absolutely no written or verbal consent after I already made it clear at least 6 times that I did not want it checked (bad previous experience with dealers). Manager came in after they realized I was upset and said "sorry I didn't know". Apparently large purchases don't require communication. Total waste of more than 2 hours of my day and now I have to wait til a weekday to contact Transunion to dispute it. If you go, maybe tell them 7 times.<//Text>

<review>Hi my name is Robbie Tapia. I recently purchased a 2019 Chevy Equinox from Liberty Chevrolet at the Selma Auto Mall. The Sales Representative  Arthur Moreno at the dealership was very knowledgeable  very curtious helped me out with questions and concerns. The process was easy .The Finance   Representative was also very professional. Answered all my questions. I highly recommend Liberty Cheverolet in Selma at the Auto Mall. And I will be doing more business with this again in near future. Thankyou Liberty Cheverolet in Selma.</review>< Pics>

I bought a used car from them (as they claimed it was owned previously by the owner himself and it is not a Chevrolet) and they only had one key on hand and promised to buy me another key after I took the car home. Weeks gone by and many excuses later, they stopped responding to me and the key they promised me never arrived. It is a lesson for me. If you have to deal with them, make sure you have everything they said written on a piece of paper.</Review>

<review>Bought a vehicle in January from this dealer and had nothing but problems. About two weeks ago my transmission on the vehicle went out and when I took it to the dealer to see if there was anything they would do for me since I was sold a terrible car, they proceeded to tell me there was nothing they could do to even help fix it. It's been nothing but issues and lies since I purchased from them and I definitely will never be going back to purchase any other vehicles and I also never recommend them to anybody I know.<//review>< pics>

<userid>118164370139745873946<//userid><text>Would not recommend taking a car or truck to be services or repaired. Took my truck in to have stability track and traction control services. Also had rear truck door to be looked at as it would not open. The stability track and traction control was repaired however the rear door was broken by the technician. I was told they would check the door and advise me on what they found. When they came to me showing me what my cost would be the paperwork showed that they were charging me about 500 to 600 dollars to replace a broken latch on rear door. I asked what that was about since nobody came to tell me what they had found When checking the door. First they said that the technician broke the latch to get the door open. Then they came back and said that as they were taking the door apart that the latch just feel apart as they were working on the door. So I got 2 different stories. If they would have checked the door and came to me before breaking it I would have told them to just leave it as it was. So now I have a broken rear door that needs to have a new latch put on. I feel that Liberty should repair this at there own cost since they took it upon themselves to break the latch without checking with me first. I am a very unhappy customer who will never recommend there service to anyone. I feel  that Liberty should be responsible and reach out to me to remedy the situation. I will never purchase another car from this dealership if they don't make this right. Rick Gonzales.< /text><time>1500941106626</time>< Pics>

Still waiting for call back and every time I call to ask to speak to the sales person who was helping me I get no answer. How sad guess they don't care. First time we purchased a car there last year they were awesome. This time around it's not good . A big waste of 3 hours to get no answers.<//review>

<Review>Sellers have no intention of helping out, they look in a bad mood not caring to sell and looked at me in an angry way, I was going to see the inventory on Colorados and had to look them from the outside. Also, they were way overpriced when I saw them at another Chevy dealer, it seems they selling you the (warranty offer ) to you instead of giving it like they advertise, Toyota down the block treated me even better, they made me feel welcome and made everything possible for me to consider making business with them so when I'm ready to buy I definitely go to Toyota instead of this clowns.

My mother just recently purchased a brand new 2015 Chevy Silverado. As well as purchasing different warranties for her paint and engine etc. We made an appointment to get the vehicle serviced because she had left on a long trip for the holidays and we asked them if they can wash it and clean it on the inside and they told us we had to schedule an appointment for that type of service and they would not charge. So I believe like a week later we called and they told us for a basic clean it was going to be $40. Wow I purchased my vehicle at a different dealer with a 5 year warranty and every time I go to get it serviced I do not have to ask they just do it. I purchased my vehicle used and my mother purchased hers brand new! So much for getting your moneys worth right?</Text>

It seems as if there was a miscommunication between our sales and service department.  Can you please have your mother contact one of the Chevrolet sales managers, John or Sven, at 559-896-5000 so they can correct the situation and get her wash taken care of.   They will be expecting her call.\n\nWe are sorry for the inconvenience, and we truly appreciate you family's business.\n\nRespectfully,\namber"}< /Response>< user_name>

Ok you asked...i am a first car buyer. I went in and I wanted to get the best deal possible.i fell in love with a 2016 Chevy Colorado.Asking price was 30k.The sales guy Eric helped get the process started. I traded in a 2008 tc  scion and got 4k for it and agreed to put 2500 so all in all 6500. Well I agreed to monthly payments of 300 a month. A different guy came in shook my hand and was congratulations.i was so HAPPY. But then got into financial services to sign n they screwed me. I ended up putting 7500 in all n payments 475. I was livid. Since then iv had to take my truck in to replace Cadillac converter n I see the snake guy who screwed me over. Watch out ladies I even told Eric the guy who helped me that i didn't trust him. I'll get his name next visit. Beware he's a Hispanic man tall cheesy smile. Oh and he fades his hair!!! Stay far away  from this guy. He's a weasel in my opinion!!!</Text>

<Text>If I could give this place zero stars I would. A very weird business practice... Please noticed that is no physically price tag in the majority of the vehicles or on the website, the crook I mean the sales man came out and I asked the price of a used car he went inside to take fresh air and after a few min later comes back to tell me a higher number to a old ugly car/lots of miles ... I tried to see more cars.. but was the same thing ... No price tag...what a waste of my time... I believe that they put a higher price  as they wish to make a profit not a good deal ...

If I could give this place zero stars I would. Husband and I drove with our 3 year old daughter 3+ hours to get a car that was promised to us (also I am 6 months pregnant). We get there to be told there was a "small hiccup" that is what the sales MANAGER had the nerve to tell us....that the car that was promised to us was sold to someone else. No help at all whatsoever and very rude.....BTW, if you are reading this sales manager....you told my husband "I am not afraid of you" well word to the wise, you should be........<//Review>

<Text>Don't ever ever take a car to this service department I took my vehicle to them because it had a tranny problem. The service guy at first told me the vehicle dint have nothing that it needs to stay one more day I said okay the next day I call in still dint have nothing till like around 3 :30 he calls me back saying it was the torque converter. I was like okay is it still cover under factory warranty he said let me check he calls me back to tell me that is not because I need the service records from the original owner I was like that doesn't make no sence  at all he said go back to the dealer where u bought it and tell them to fix okay I agreed but if is still has warranty why again he said u need the service records. So I went to pick up my vehicle instead. And I told him that what u were saying is wrong and he said  I'm not going to argued over this. Find I dint want to pay them at first but u know what I told my  wife pay him before we get in putasos. The service advisor told me u better watch what your saying I was like do u even know what putasos mean he said yea  your going to kick my ass. I was like that's not  what it means but okay. This guy lie to gm putting on the service paper the tranny oil was dirty and it was missing 2 quarts of oil that I used violence against them not once did I do that I think I have right to explain myself  and that I neglected the vehicle. bottom line if you guys dint want to work on the vehicle in the first place u should of said something not lie about everything that vehicle dint have. But this place had other customer behind me also complaining to them one customer  was saying why are u guys taking so long to put a motor in. is being three months another one was like u guys did a oil change and it's leaking oil from the filter. is this that kind of service technicians u guys hired  that don't know what they are doing. Everyone on here complaining has a Spanish name  that does tell u something about this place. Not only did u guys also scratch my glove compartment and don't want to take responsibility for it. I want a refund this was bad service i took my vehicle for a second inspection and they found it was a faulty torque converter they dint find the oil dirty or that it was missing 2 quarts it was cover under the factory warranty and it was fix we will never purchased a vehicle again from chevy bad costomer service nothing but little kids working that don't know what they are doing  we have purchased like six vehicle from u guys but not no more Will take our business to clovis instead< /Text>< pics>

<Pics>None<//Pics><Review>Bought a 2016 Camaro SS from them BRAND NEW in October of 2016. Ever since I bought the car it has had intermittent problems with the USB port, and complete failure of the drivers door locks and trunk button.  I now live in Irvine, and took the car to the dealer to get this looked at. (Simpson Chevrolet, great place)

They informed me that the Interior Spectrum Lighting kit which was dealer installed, was INCORRECTLY installed (I'm talking no solder, just twisted wires here folks!) and it's causing all of the electrical issues I'm having.

Liberty Chevrolet wants me to take my Camaro all the way to Selma from Irvine so they can "make sure" they did it. OF COURSE you did it! I bought it from you NEW, and it was this way! I even found your tech's interior trim tool under the seat!

Driving all the way to Selma from Irvine is ridiculous, for them to look at a problem they created. They need to compensate me by covering the repair charges I will have to pay here at Simpson Chevrolet in Irvine, CA.

Next step is going to GM directly.<//Review><user_id>107518168899340617082<//user_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I wouldn't recommend this dealership to anyone. I knew more about the cars than the salesmen did. They're all a bunch of college age kids with no professionalism whatsoever. I suggest you take your business to Hedrick's Chevrolet in Clovis where they treat you with respect.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><name>Cal Hobbes<//name><user>110663866924495616322</user>< gmapID>

Excellent. I couldn't have asked for better service.  Everyone was polite, professional and helpful.  I had excellent service every time I called, and they went out of their way to help me rent a car and pick my car up. My car looks great.  I paid for the repairs myself and was surprised at the fair prices in an upscale location.<//Review>

<username>Gratitude Attracts Blessings - Sam<//username><Time>1569535450730< /Time><Rating>1</Rating><text>Went to get a dent fixed. Shop employees were friendly and told me to go in to the office, a tiny space with 3 men. All 3 ignored me standing 3 feet from them. Then asked me "what?" Like there's any reason other than a car repair anyone would go there. One guy told me to sit and wait as if I'm in their way. After waiting and being ignored for a while, I left. If that's before they take your car and money, imagine how terribly wrong customer service can be afterwards when they have your car. May they were having a bad day. Wish you guys success.< /text>< pictures>

<review>Just before closing on a Friday afternoon, I went in for an estimate for some cosmetic bumps and bruises to my fenders and cloudy headlights.
Junior asked me if I had a few minutes to wait in their cool and comfortable office, I said yes.  When I  came out my headlight covers were like new and the paint on my fender was gone. I did not expect any work to be done 10 min to closing, but it was !
Terrific customer service, I highly recommend their work.

These guys are totally dependable and trustworthy. You can be sure they they'll do great work, and are always honest, and never out to gauge you. I've been there several times and they always help me find the most cost effective solution and are all around nice guys. They've even advised me on how to deal with insurance, and threw in a temporary fix of my Xenon headlight for free, when I couldn't afford to replace it. It's because of their honesty and integrity that they stay so busy.</text>

<review>Hands down best experience I've ever had throughout a difficult situation. Having an accident sucks. I did a little searching for a good collision repair shop and I found Certified Collision Craft. Right out the gates they showed me they were going to earn my business. I was greeted by Junior as I pulled in. He is experienced and got everything going for me very quickly. 5 days after dropping of my car I was called in to pick it up. They did an amazing job on the repair, my car actually looked better than it did before my accident. I am extremely satisfied with their professionalism and workmanship. I would honestly recommend Certified Collision Craft to anyone who needs repairs.< /review>< Response>

Absolutely the best shop I have ever been to in my life. After working in the rental car Industry I can say no one treated customers better than at Certified. My car is being repaired there now and as long as I live in or near LA I will take my car here if the situation arises.</text>

<Text>I had hit a parked car at my apartment, my car had a large black scrape along the side and the car that I hit had a small scratch on the driver's side front corner. After leaving a note on the car with my information I took pictures of the damage. I immediately called a auto repair shop and took my car in to get looked at hoping that they could buff out the scratch, once there they took my information and created an estimate that they emailed me which came out to $2500. Freaking out about the price I called Certified Collision Craft which I found on google and was only a few minutes away from my apartment. The gentleman's name who answered the phone was Junior and he told me that I can bring it in and that they'd see what they can do. I told him my main concern was getting the dark color off of my car. He took my car and about 15-20 minutes later he showed me my car completely free of the dark marks and did it FREE OF CHARGE. The woman's car that I had hit contacted me and I sent her their to get hers buffed out and said that I will pay for the repair. Junior was so kind and I can't express enough how much I appreciate their service. I would recommend Certified Collision Craft for anyone looking for auto service!</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

I got into hit and run accident on freeway and was really upset about it. My nephew did recommend Certified Collision Craft. It was the best decision. Mike did handle everything: insurance estimate , rental car to pick me up & calm me down promising to take good care of my car. When  I  picked up my car it looked us new - even some old scratches were fixed. They did  great job. Hopefully I won't need it  anytime soon but that the place where I will go if something happen.   Thank you Mike.<//Text>

These guys run a family business and they're great!
When Michael, the owner, gives you an estimate, THAT is the price you pay. You'll never hear any excuses about "this here, that there, oh and an other thing about this."
What Michael tells you, he and his son Junior go out of their way to do for you.
If you're vehicle needs an extra part he didn't quote you on, they take care of it, while at the same time jumping through hoops with your insurance company to handle the legal nonsense on your behalf.

A friend of mine had recommended it to me when my girlfriend needed body work done as the lease on her Prius was ending (which they did excellent work on) and now they've done great work for me too.

When I was in the office, I saw an unattended computer open with their Google reviews page open. What that tells me is; this is a business striving to build a reputation on doing good, honest work. And they absolutely do!
If you need work done, this is the place.<//text>

***STAY AWAY FROM THESE DISHONORABLE SHOP!!!!  *****

So I took my car in for a small little repair. I have been going to this shop for years and I know mike through my father. I figured it would be a good place to take my car due to the fact that it's a family owned and they repair high end vehicles, so I felt secure and safe.

This isn't a vehicle I drive on a daily bases, so when I picked up the car I was in a big rush and didn't have a minute to really look at the car closely. However, I have my detailers that come to my home once a week or sometimes twice a week and he notices all the scratches on the car. I asked him what is this from. He stated that this is from the body shop. This is from overspray, and improper care for the vehicle when it was at the shop. So, I asked him how to fix this issue and he told me that it would cost about 850.00 to fix.

Naturally, I was very upset and I drove the car over to the shop and told him to fix it. He decide that he will give me the name of his Detailer and that it would be cheaper. I kept calling the guy and he never responded. He didn't respond to text, calls or anything for that matter.

I called the owner Michael and he started to make excuses and I told him if I cannot get this done immediately, I will have to do it on my own and he will be on the hook for the 850.00. He got very upset with me and told me he would pay for half and I said, I shouldn't be responsible for something his shop made a mistake on and left scratches and overspray on my 200k Porsche.

I have still not received the money I paid and he kept telling me he will pay for half and never got that back either. I had to detail my car several times and still have the damage on my vehicle with no remorse from him!

He thinks the law doesn't apply to him and he thinks that he there is no way to get justice.

I will be taking this guy to court as well!

This is absolutely ridiculous!!< /Review>

<Text>As a younger female having her first car accident while living on the opposite side of the country from my entire family...it was traumatic to say the least. I didn't know what to do, where to go, the proper steps to take and I was completely overwhelmed. I thought this whole process would be daunting and never end not to mention I was positive anywhere I went they were going to try and hustle me...not Certified Collision. They were extremely friendly, helpful and made the whole process a complete breeze. They helped me with a rental car and in under an hour I was in and out of there. I picked up the car and it looked better than when I purchased it. Absolutely amazing service and I recommend to anyone and everyone. Thank you!<//Text>< rate>

Mike, the owner will take care of you!

I went here to get my car fixed and I had to pay out of pocket because I didn't have collision. The estimate he gave me was exact and didn't charge a penny over. We didn't discuss a few other things that came up after I picked up the car which I understand cost extra. They definitely went above and beyond by repairing scratches that i didn't even ask to be fixed! Would recommend this place! There were minor tweaks that needed to be done after I picked up, but they were right on it and of course no extra charge. Example, Hood wouldn't close unless I dropped it from pretty high up, etc.</Text>

I took my 2010 mazda 3 into Certified Collision Craft last week because they were well-reviewed and also within walking distance from my house, saving me from the hassle of renting a car. I damaged my car the week before by accidently side-swiping the right back door of my car along a metal fence pole. Then a couple of days after that my left rear light and bumper were damaged by a lady in a wells fargo parking lot. The side of my car had the same texture as Ray Liotta's face and i had a sinking feeling in the pit of my wallet. The first estimate i received made me cringe a little, but the guy i was talking to assured me if i talked to the guy in charge, Michael, he would help me out. So i go the next day and talk with Michael and I was happily surprised at the price he worked out for me. He was very polite and reassuring, making sure that i understood that my car was in good hands. I came back today and picked up my car, and i was extremely happy to see my car looking BETTER than new. Michael and his guys fixed what i came in for and more. the small scratches from curbs on my front bumper, the little nicks from backing up into bushes, tiny imperfections on my car were all gone. Not to mention, they also washed and detailed my car and fed me blueberry muffins. These guys are awesome<//Text>

Im never excited about what's on their menu but I'm excited that my kids have videos and no gripes. It seems much cleaner and better stick them before.  They moved dine things around and it looks nicer. The staff is VERY VERY friendly.<//Text>

Excellent value!  Buffet style restaurant serving almost every kind of comfort food that you can imagine.  Space for large groups.  "All you can eat" for a reasonable price.  Men's room was a little dirty, but I mentioned it to the cashier and she had someone take care of it immediately.  Plenty of free parking including several spots for people with disability plates/placards.<//Review>

Such a clean place, kept tidy continually. All employees are friendly and no yelling among the cooks in the back, it's great to see such peaceful team work. The restrooms were also very clean. I definitely recommend you go, alone or with family.</Text>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>I think this is the best of the two home town buffets in the area. A close friend recommended this place to me several years ago and my family and I have eaten here often when we are in town. Food is always good, great variety and it's frequently replenished. Good service, and the price is affordable. My only con is when they have frozen yogurt instead of soft serve ice cream (which is my favorite) but that's a personal thing, as everyone else in my family doesn't mind it. I recommend this home town if you are in the Fresno area.< /Review>< pics>

<Date>1582263971476</Date><rating>1<//rating><review>This place was absolute s.h.i.t. food was dried out and untouched. Not getting ROTATED OUT *ranch was thick and cakey, and beans and ground meat had gotten dried on top from not being stirred for fresh foods!!!! Do not recommend UNLESS you go on a very BUSY time of day. Also food choices are very lacking as well as mainly packaged food -not hardly cooked-.. Its not the same like it was several years ago... Probably due to change of management and wanting to cut cost on food prices and maybe for convenience.....? I would pass. (I had went here with my family tonight, we got there at 6:30pm.) Only reason for one star is because one of the lady workers took her time to make us cotton candy, i appreciate her, she was very nice and kind.< /review>< Pictures>

This particular HTB is kept organized, clean, and the staff is super efficient under their management because management works with staff at the same level when work needs to be done.  When you pave the way and lead by example, your staff follows suit.

Thank you for leading an exemplary team and for keeping your place nice and clean (tables free of grime is a huge plus).

💝 5 Stars for a HTB experience.</review>

Home town buffet has changed from when it 1st appeared. The food then tasted homemade from scratch. Now the taste and the quality of the food has changed. I don't care for it anymore it's like frozen food.<//Review>

We always love hometown buffet. Despite what people think, not the same food every time. They do have their Staples, but they rotate dishes every so often so there's more of a selection. Love this place! My kids always pick it for birthdays.< /Text>

I haven’t visited a hometown buffet in years. And let me tell you. I was so pleased with the taste of food and staff. It really impacted my view on hometown buffet.

<Review>This store is very clean, with friendly and efficient staff. The Manger was constantly circulating to make sure the dining experience is top. The food was fresh and when something was running low it was quickly replenished. No real criticism to speak of. Great comfort food, great restaurant.<//Review></record>

I hadn't been to the Shaw Hometown buffet in awhile. I didn't like that they were not in control of the children touching the food. My visit this time was better. 10 and under really shouldn't be serving their own food unless with an adult helping.< /text>

On 6/26/18 at approx. 3:30 I entered restaurant. Immediately I felt at home with the hostess friendly smile and welcome. The food always excellent with fair variety. Served me a fairly small plate but well mixed including vegetables (Love that Squash). Not a minute passed by without the hostess managing counter and cleaning tables, glanced my way to be sure I was OK. Very peaceful atmosphere. Absolutely will continue to have my meals at this place. Not a better pleasure than a well enjoyed meal.< /review>

<review>Really good food. I went for a very late lunch / early dinner and the salad didn't seem fresh. The croutons were soft an unfresh too. But besides that everything was really good and the staff was very nice.

The food is good. but not all the time. Fruit isn't fresh. The ceasar salad was very soggy. Not much of a dessert selection. I think the price for adults is too high for the quality of food they have.<//Text>

<text>It was $69 for six of us to eat. Usually its an okay place for lunch with my kids but this time many plates and cups were set out with food still on them so the dishwasher is blind! The sweet tea was sour from being so old and no chocolate milk. I got tired of complaining to the poor waitress so we finished best we could and left. Will never go back to this place. It really grosses me out seeing old food on supposedly clean dishes and i love sweet tea....just not when its over two hours old.

<time>1562640501148< /time><rating>1</rating><Text>I came on July 7, 2019. When we arrived, we ordered for 2 adult, 1 child, and 1 senior. The girl kept messing up for some reason but it was fine as I knew that Hometown Buffet wasn't a top notch restaurant. We sat in our booth and served ourselves. The food was mediocre at best. The mac and cheese as well as the alfredo pasta was very watery with almost no taste.The pizza was cold and had no flavor. The spaghetti was not drained but the sauce and meatballs made up for it. The broccoli was meh. The atmosphere was very weird and the temperature was freezing. Less than halfway into eating, our food was cold. The desert was okay. It was probably the best part or our meal. We took home some cheesecake and it seemed alright. We returned home and everything went by like normal. Until a couple hours later and all four of us started projectile vomiting all night and slept with stomach cramps. My sister and I had diarrhea and our taste buds disappeared. This was my first time in that restaurant and believe me, I will not be returning.< /Text>< pics>

Food not as good as I recalled and a bit dim however the customer service was very nice.  All interaction was quite friendly.  Bathroom could use some regular cleaning though.  Every stall shouldn't need assistance...<//review>

<Text>Has gone down in quality since the last time I was there over a year ago. It was 13.99 for an adult and 2.69 extra if you want to drink anything. Biscuits were hard as rocks , stuffing and potatoes were dry. Really all of the food didnt look fresh at all. Youre paying almost 20 dollars for a meal your Grandma could make better, plus shed love to see you.</Text>< Pictures>

They used to have ham, roast beef, and salad that's not dried up. The last two times I visited this month all they had was dried out chicken. It wasn't quite as dry the second visit. We might try breakfast one time but not even sure we will bother. The ham and roast beef have always been our reason for going.< /Review>

It's been a few years since we've been here. So today we went now I see why we haven't been back. Hot food was not kept up salad bar was not full salad had no color looked like just white lettuce including the heart of the lettuce.  Eggs and cheese were hard croutons were stale. Restroom paper machine was not working.  Seating was very narrow they even let people sit at the end table which made it difficult for someone with a cane to walk through. Food had no flavoring. For as much as we paid we could've went to another restaurant.<//text>

<Text>There has been a big decline in the appeal for going to HomeTown Buffet since all the TV commercials claiming how great the place is began airing.
The greatly reduced menu options are a turn-off. The choices now seem to be very limited.

For us, the very best single menu item, the Orange Sorbet, is no longer available. It was a major factor for us to pick HomeTown Buffet on any given night.

Fried fish, which my wife always selected, is no longer regularly available. The last 4 of the last 5 times we came, on various nights, no fried fish.

The "fresh" tortillas are almost always hard as a rock, that is, they are inedible.

Now there are a variety of unappealing little pots that pretty much all look the same (mystery meat dishes?).

Chicken pot pies are a nice addition, if you also get a piece to chicken to cut up and add as a supplement to the mostly gravy under the pie crust.

The prices are up and the quality is down. Not the best way to attract and keep customers.</Text>< time>

Go at the right time and there will be plenty of food. When there's plenty of food you'll have a happy tummy and you'll be a happy camper. This place never disappoints.</text>

The food was great, and it taste good. There were variety of foods to choose from. Salad bar, Italian section, and all other food sections were great. The food was so good I had to wait in line for the server to replace the empty trays during early evening dinner!< /review>

The cashier is checking ppl in running to clean tables. Food courts r empty & dry & looks a bit old from sitting too long they need to bring out fresh food & more help. Not at all happy with the service & it's too pricey 12.99 + 2.50 drink. We should have gone across the street for the price & fresh food!<//Review><user_name>Lydia Ramirez< /user_name><user_id>112804341168111482545< /user_id><pictures>None< /pictures>< Date>

I used to love coming to Home Town but I haven't been here in a long time but my visit today was under satisfactory. I went to the carvery several times but there was no one there so I couldn't get any of that. Many of the dishes were empty so there wasn't a lot to choose from, and the dessert table only had about 3 or 4 plates on the entire table. The pizza was burned on the bottom, and overall the food areas looked very sloppy. The staff were only talking amongst themselves and not interacting with any customer except to sell pie. Like I said I used to love coming here but im not sure that I'd come back unless it improves.<//review>

<text>My wife, son, and I went for breakfast on a Sunday about 2 1/2 weeks ago. We arrived at a breakfast/lunch transition and immediately hit the Mexican food. The taco meat was corned beef hash from earlier in the morning that they seasoned with taco seasoning (I only tasted the corned beef after I had thrown it up), everything was a mess, food still on "clean" plates and silverware, bathrooms were DISGUSTING, and my son and I were both violently ill within 12 hours. My wife contacted the company and heard from a district manager who visited the location later that day, corroborated our story saying "I will be treating this incident as a food-bourne illness and refund your money." I have not received a refund and the district manager stopped returning calls. My family will never eat at a Hometown Buffet ever again.< /text><rate>1</rate><user_name>Alex Asten<//user_name><date>1531870985394</date><pictures>None<//pictures><userid>104117637052059798979<//userid>< Resp>

You get what you pay for. Very low quality food. The chicken was undercooked and old it seemed. The ice cream machine wasnt working at all. A lot of the food was just bad. The service was nice but that didnt stop do any of the food justice. The best thing i had was probably the mac n cheese and pizza which tasted alright.</text>

<pics>None</pics><text>Very busy. Food was ok. Mac and cheese was delicious the first time but the refill was somewhat runny. Kids eat free monday -thursday. Understaffed for sure. Waitress did what she could as far as keeping dirty plates off the table. Cotton candy machine a big hit for adults and kids. The bee was very fun and kid friendly. Price was reasonable for two adults.</text>< user_name>

Weeda (i know i spelled it wrong) she was very nice and always asking how we are doing. Wish more fresh food was going out faster and a bigger selection of deserts.</Text>

<review>I hated this place because 1 we now have to pay for the steak which is the stupidest thing I've ever heard of 2. The food that was served was really cold and wasn't even fresh. And 3. The meats that were served wasn't even fresh meat it was meat from the day before and it was the most disgusting thing I've ever eaten. HomeTown Buffett is not what it used to be.< /review>< user_id>

Food is good,  selection varies.  Team members is a hit it miss, but for the most part are great.  Restrooms tend to sometimes need maintenance.</Text>

I like pan cakes. I don't like blue berries. At 10:30 am all they had out were blue berries pancakes. They didnt put anymore out. To close to lunch I guess. I probably won't be back.<//text>

<Text>One star only because there were no 0 stars....first of all for the $109 I payed at least the food could've been cooked properly...the meatloaf was under cooked pink in the middle the prime cut roast was served cold the fried chicken was burnt on the outside and pink and runny on the inside and to top it off it was FREEZING in there I honestly don't think I'll be coming back to this location totally not worth what they charged us< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< gmapID>

< Review>
Disappointed. Maybe it was just a bad chef today. I've been to several of these hometown in the hopes of getting the good food I remember hometown for, but have been disappointed most everytime. Everything tastes generic and processed. Mashed potatoes and meatloaf had only a very weak resemblance to real mashed potatoes and gravy. I will not be eating here again.<//Review>

There's only 2 Hometown buffets in the Notown.
The one on peach and shaw has closed down.
Excellent service, great place to bring all your family. Varieties of food at lunch and dinner.
The desserts are so good you might literally inhale them, but don't take my word.
Taste it for yourself.</Text>

<text>This is by far the worst experience I have ever had at Hometown. The place is not what it used to be. The whole restaurant is dirty rundown and the plates and utensils are sticky and unpleasant. Then you have the food selection which got worse and less of since a couple of years back. Your better off going to a fast food place.</text>< Name>

<Text>It is very clean and the staff is helpful and nice, but I'm not a fan of the sides. They're nothing special. The main entrees like steak and chicken are really delicious. The salad bar is really good too. Wish they had a salad with romain lettuce that didn't have cesar dressing on it.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

Filthy sugar and cream tray, like it hadn't been clean in weeks. Spotted with dirty stains, dried ketchup stains, with empty cream cup inside tray. Basic food, not worth bumping in to people about to run u over to get to over cooked, unseasoned food, and most of the food trays were empty, couldn't find a waitress to clean the only table we could fine. Well not ever go back.< /Text>

Sunday brunch, too many people, running out of food, and ran out of clean silverware. Lots of young kids serving themselves at buffet. I'm never going back to this location<//text>

There was very little to no food laid out to get. The place itself was messy and dirty. The trays in which the food was held in were dirty as well, concerning the food in those trays: it looked as if that food had been there for days. I am only giving it one star due to the fact I cannot give it zero, and my sorrow goes out to the only one waitress serving everyone today.</Text>

The service was horrible the server never came to your table they never came and got your plates and the fish looked yellow and the cookies were burnt the bathroom were dirty and it had to take a manager to come pick up your plates.and I would never eat there again.they told me they would make it right and I paid for 3 meals and they said well only give you one meal if you ask me how is that makeing it right when the other two people came with me to shouldn't they get it right also and all I wanted was my money back they they told me they can't do that.i would never eat there again and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.<//Review>

SAD TO SAY, BUT I am really DISAPPOINTED WITH HOMETOWN BUFFET NOW.  Use to be a place one could go and have a pretty decent meal of Quality and menu selection..

THE NEW MENU (as we see it) provides less VARIETY and QUALITY, and IS NOT TO OUR LIKING..........The new CEO has made changes, yes, but NOT FOR THE BETTER................to the point we WILL NO LONGER BE EATING THERE.  Went in for dinner Nov 29, 2014 and paid for two.

The first thing I preceded to do was to get some STEAK, WHAT? - NO STEAK!, YEP, NO STEAK and also tried TO GET A BAKED POTATO..........WELL GUESS WHAT....NO BAKED POTATO FOR DINNER, but was TOLD IT IS JUST SERVED ON THE LUNCH MENU.

........  THE BUFFET NO LONGER SERVES STEAK along with its ham and roast beef, etc..  WOULD YOU BELIEVE THAT IN PLACE OF STEAK, they NOW SERVE A PATHETIC TASTELESS HAMBURGER PATTY , yes I said HAMBURGER PATTY which NOW REPLACES STEAK ON THEIR DINNER MENU.  Thought they were finally getting their act together when they got rid of THEIR CHEAP LOW QUALITY GRISTLE STEAK   and replaced it with a higher quality steak without the gristle.

Heck, IF I WANT A HAMBURGER PATTY, I CAN GO TO MCDONALDS or IN AND OUT (just any drive in burger joint).

All the many little servings thingies they have in the little "skillet" type of containers, are non-edible...need to be done away with.

We had thought bout going to SIZZLER'S , NOW I BELIEVE THAT IS DEFINITELY THE CHOICE FOR DINNER FROM NOW ON.  GREATLY DISAPPOINTED WITH HOMETOWN BUFFET..........their new MENU needs to take a DUMP.  Come to think of it, it already has taken a DUMP.

In short, STAY AWAY.  AS FOR WE, THE PRICE GOES UP AND THE QUALITY OF THE NEW MENU SELECTION HAS  DIMINISHED GREATLY DOWNWARD.  AGAIN STAY AWAY.

........the new CEO HAS POISONED THE WELL..........

Think I will have to send an email to CEO or may just send him a snail mail of the above review.<//Text>

It's a buffet, nothing special about it. I wish they had more unique items, but it's just like every other buffet, except some of the food is overly spiced or overly cooked and dry.<//Text>

(Translated by Google) It’s a buffet.
Not a high-end buffet restaurant for Western food!
The building is right, and the disappointment is low.
Because it’s really a buffet
Not a restaurant buffet

(Original)
是自助餐哦
不是西餐的高級自助餐廳哦！
心裡建設對了，失望也就低。

<text>(Translated by Google) This is a restaurant opened by Taiwanese people. It’s hard to get a full-flavoured restaurant. The dishes are very rich. The boss is also very enthusiastic, but it is a bit salty. It should be in line with the taste of the locals!

(Original)
這是一個台灣人開的餐廳很難得，一個吃到飽的餐廳，菜色很豐富老闆也很熱情，但有點偏鹹，應該是為了配合當地人的口味吧！<//text><Pics>None</Pics><gmapID>0x80946618708b8893:0xe2db84fa5bd33cbe<//gmapID><Date>1550660852913</Date>< Rate>
