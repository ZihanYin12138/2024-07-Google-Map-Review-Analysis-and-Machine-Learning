<Review>I have gotten such great service from everyone who works here.  Even my dog loves how friendly everyone is to him :)

Shout out to Stephanie for going above an beyond
Kudos to Miguel for his fine work
and a great big bark of approval to Sam who always stops and says hello to my dog

I first moved here because of Danielle and her amazing attitude.

I have been so lucky to have gotten help from Vincent and Caesar .. I just cannot say enough good things about the staff here and they all deserve KUDOS!<//Review>< Pictures>

<time>1620797047462< /time><rate>5< /rate><review>I moved in a week ago after a UTC neighbor and former resident both recommended Valentia to me. The staff usually does a great job keeping me updated by email and scheduling appointments work great.

Caesar, Sam, and Miguel are part of the very professional and courteous maintenance staff - kind and fast turnaround times for fixing or replacing all the small issues I discovered when first moving in, plus a set of new blinds and efficient dryer.

There was new flooring put in unevenly and Caesar is currently working with the contractors to resolve. Will update this later.

Feb 2021 Update:
After about a month of scheduling, Danielle worked tirelessly to track down the flooring company on multiple appointments.

The limitations of putting hardwood floors into an older building comes with patches of uneven surfaces. Even with their best efforts, you just have to expect that these floorboards will creak and groan at certain hot spots both above and below you.

If you're unlucky and have heavy-footed walkers or little kids around you, it might drive you nuts to work at home. Unless you live on the top floor, you'll likely notice how much sound travels between the thin floors. Leaf blowers and landscaping in the neighborhood every Tuesday and Wednesday cannot be avoided.

I have personally invested in some rugs and soft sole sandals to help with the noise near the bedroom/bath between levels, which also helps with the bare floors on colder winter mornings.<//review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN4NrYllLZHbnNLYoCiB-Yyb2uFT2lGj-BDPS6h=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOeLYe8qBVB2OnnyuYVtn2-cQB1VQcua7AkVqya=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><Response>{'time': 1610238445841, 'text': 'Hi Jacky!

We lived at Valentia for one year and really enjoyed the space. The on-site staff are incredibly helpful. All of our issues were either pandemic specific or with the parent company that runs Valentia. In short:

Pros: beautiful common green spaces and gardens, our patio has a beautiful view, maintenance staff are helpful and prompt, office staff are helpful as well, apartment is well-maintained, walls and floors are thick so we rarely hear our neighbors inside their apartments.

Cons: There is so much landscaping work every day, making it really loud to work from home. There were lots of maintenance issues that disrupted wfh, and we were usually not given advanced notice so we could make arrangements (although that has gotten better in the last month). Rent was not discounted even though we could not use any of the common amenities we were paying for (most pool areas, gym, common spaces, etc.) The kitchens are dated, although functional, but it can be frustrating given the cost of rent. Lots of extra fees that you don't find out about until after moving in (for example, $80 a month for trash removal). Odd mix of families and college students, so there is noise outside most hours of the day and night (7am - 2am), but that comes with the neighborhood.

We're moving for situational reasons, and we would live here again if we were continuing to rent in UTC. And don't ignore the park across the street- it's an amazing location if you have dogs, kids, or like to take walks.<//Text>

<text>We just moved in and we could not be happier with everything about our new life in Valentia and San Diego. A big shout out to Jessamine from the leasing office at Valentia because she went out of her way to make our moving experience a pleasurable one. She had all the paperwork ready for us and answered every little question we had (we had a ton of questions because we moved from a small community near the Mojave desert). Her demeanor, friendliness and patience made us feel at ease and she even helped us with a package that arrived early when we were not even in the area yet. Thank you Jessamine and all the Valentia team. We absolutely love everything about this peaceful yet cheerful complex!<//text>< Resp>

I have had very positive experience with the way Stephanie Jones
in the Valentia Apartments front office responded to my multiple
requests about number of issues recently.
I believe she is quite capable and knowledgeable in her job.
She is very helpful and easy to communicate with. She is definitely
a valuable asset for the organization.< /Text>

<review>I have known Stephanie for the entire two years which I have been a resident at Shea’s Valentia Apartments. She has been invaluable in assisting me with all matters renewing my lease, and several inevitable tenant questions and concerns.
I have vast experience in the service industry, and I can rightfully opine, thst Stephanie is one of the most intelligent, knowledgeable, patient, skilled and kind people I have met. She is a major value to your team, and I have enjoyed immensely our interactions!

One week a go my wife and I just moved in the apartment,
Office staff and everybody are nice add friendly.
I needed some minor maintenance work done. A sweet lady in the office took my request. She was very friendly and helpful to me.
Next day a man name Sam called me and setup a service schedule. Sam came on time. Well prepped and conscious about COVID to protect each other. He did a great job  beyond my expectation.
I think this is nothing but refutation of management's leadership and training.< /Text>

I lived at Valentina for three years and we loved every second of it! The office staff has always been very kind, helpful, and always available. The pool, hot tubs, and bbq’s are reliable, accessible and awesome amenities to have at your fingertips. Every time we had a maintenance issue, it was addressed and fixed in a timely manner. We have nothing negative to say!

Furthermore, I just had a package recently delivered to my old apartment by accident and the office staff were so kind that they are sending it to my new address. 5 stars through and through!!!< /review>

Not to mention the Maintainance requests were usually completed within a few hours majority of the time.

In terms of quality, service, amenities and value,  Valentia stands alone. I especially loved the oversize patio equipped with a storage room, washer and dryer. The apartment homes are bright, modern and well maintained. We thoroughly enjoyed both pools and spa, the fitness center, playing pool and using the business center.

This community has a feeling of residential camaraderie. The staff planned socials, special holiday events, even food trucks. It certainly was nice to come home after a long day at work and conveniently grab a bite to eat!

The staff are extremely friendly and professional. In fact, they actually remembered our names  as well as our fur babies. Yes, fur babies are welcome here in select buildings. My husband and I have fond memories of our Valencia home and gladly recommend living there.< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<Name>Kayla Torres< /Name><Review>This is by far the cleanest and quietest complex I've ever lived in, and I've live all around San Diego County. So that part is wonderful. The buildings/apartments are a little older but they're very well maintained. The staff here (leasing and maintenance) are absolutely amazing! Danielle, Vincent, and Stephanie are top notch in the office. I have had more problems here with dryer issues, smoke alarm malfunction, certain bugs, minor flooding than most places, but the staff is quick and responsive and always makes up for any issue I've ever had. It’s usually Sam from maintenance who assists and he is incredibly professional and very friendly! It's pretty expensive but for the area, not bad. The neighborhood is absolutely gorgeous, conveniently located right off the 805 and right by UTC mall. You really do get what you pay for! People around here are friendly and courteous and we've never had any issues with safety. Overall, definitely recommend! - From a verified resident on ApartmentRatings<//Review>< Resp>

<text>Valentia Apartments is a wonderful place to live with fantastic staff who go out of their way to take care of the community’s residents. I lived there for two years and highly recommend it.

The apartments are spacious, quiet, safe and very well maintained. But what really makes this apartment community a stand-out is the staff. The office staff—Danielle, Stephanie, Vince and Monica—take great pride in their jobs and it shows. The same is true from the maintenance staff. They all go above and beyond to support Valentia’s residents. Vince helped me with the move-in process and promptly responded to any questions or issues that came up during my two years at the community. And once I left, the team’s support didn’t stop. Shortly after I moved, a package was delivered to my former address at Valentia. Danielle emailed me to let me know and then sent the package to my new address. These are just a few examples of how the staff truly make Valentia Apartments a great place to live in San Diego.< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

<GmapID>0x80dc00cb8375fa55:0x8d2dff0e65c3afdc< /GmapID><Review>Hello!

Shortly after selling my home in Arizona I moved to the Valentia apartment complex in San Diego.  My intention was to adopt a short-term stay, but I ended up staying more than four years. The Property Management Team was most accommodating as they kept me informed of any changes and/or activities in relation to my apartment. The location was perfect for taking extended walks around the park, walking my dog thus allowing him to play in the nearby dog park. Moreover, I felt safe living in a community where my grandchildren could run and play. I liked the fact that Valentia took pride in the property upkeep; kudos to the maintenance team for their diligent work.  Overall, I enjoyed my stay at this location and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a short-term or long-term stay.

Thank you,

Sebrina D.</Review>< rate>

< Review>
Do not live here. The walls and floors are thin. My upstairs neighbors leave their dog barking all day and when they come home it’s constant stomping, jumping, turning on their bathtub sounds. Yes I can hear them running a bath because the floors are that thin. Appliances are outdated. There are no fans in the master bathroom or the separate toilet room. The dishwasher will randomly stops in the middle of a wash. There are also standing water in the dishwasher that causes molds. The kitchen is so small that it can only fit 1 person at a time. I have 2 other roommates. We had fly issues on our balcony for months and the balcony was thoroughly cleaned twice. We couldn’t figure out where they’re coming from.
I will not be renewing my lease once it’s up in a month. I’m considering moving out early just to get away from this place. Take your money somewhere that you can actually live comfortable.< /Review>

<Review>I absolutely loved my time living at Valentia! The grounds are beautiful and extremely well-kept. The apartment units are spacious and well-maintained. Danielle and the front office staff are wonderful and make you feel at home immediately upon moving in. There are also fun perks and events held on a monthly basis, such as trivia nights or food trucks that park right in front of the leasing office. My time as a resident there went by way too fast, and I highly recommend Valentia to anyone looking for a new place to live in the UTC area!< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>{'time': 1606167736032, 'text': 'Hi Brett!

I have lived here for three months, and while the move-in process was seamless and the apartment cleaning was meticulous, emergency maintenance this weekend was exceptional. From the call center representative to the maintenance worker to the property manager, everyone was prompt, proficient, and polite. Thank you!<//Text>

I spent 7 months at Valentia and I could not be more impressed with the front office staff (specifically Danielle and her team). The apartment was great, the location is phenomenal, and the staff are caring and responsive. As a renter for the past 15 years, I have never experienced the level of professionalism and care that Valentia staff displayed daily anywhere else. The maintenance team is quick and responsive and the front office staff truly went out of their way on numerous occasions to assist me...even in the weeks after I moved out. Stop looking at apartments and sign here. You won't regret it.<//Text>

< Review>
We moved back to San Diego from Seattle and as if moving and home hunting weren't stressful enough already, doing it all online and from across the country is just the cherry on top of that cake. However, Valentia apartments caught our eye with a great move-in special, which is just what we needed during this tough year. The leasing team, especially Monica, were just such a delight to work with and really helped us find the best unit for us and our two dogs and made the process so easy. We love our apartment and even when we found a couple maintenance repairs that needed attention, they made sure they were dealt with right away. Thanks again, guys!< /Review>

The management is very friendly and attentive, the 2 BR apartments are huge, and the area is very nice and quiet.  Great place to live!

There were several issues during move-in, notably that I chose a carpeted unit, but maintenance converted the floor to vinyl hardwood shortly before move in.  Monica did everything that she could to correct the situation, including offering an alternate apartment that was becoming available.  We ultimately decided not to move (tough to move everything a second time), but Monica continued to help us as much as she could.<//Review>

< review>
We have quite a few apartments at Valentia and they are definitely one of our favorite communities to work with. Vincent, Danielle, and Stephanie are all very quick to respond to any emails and requests that are sent over. They also understand that people are people and things happen. They have gone out of their way multiple times to come to a workable solution for everyone involved.

I know one of the biggest concerns in communities is maintenance. Things happen in apartments, the response is what counts. Valentia's response is always fast and the resolution is swift. On the rare occasion that something big happens, they are quick to resolve it and assist in whatever way is necessary.

We love working with Valentia and their team. They truly care about the community and do everything they can to make sure all the residents enjoy their home.</review>

<review>--- Update as of 5/7/2021 ---
tl;dr (from my experience):
- 6 months been living here.
- Helpful staff, and quick turn over
- have malfunctioning equipment and staff response was very efficient.
- Problem resolved successfully

full story:
Have been living here now for 6 months and the place continues to be phenomenal, although with pandemic we got no access to printers and that can be very helpful, needless to say it has been a pleasant experience overall

The takeaway of this update is to let everyone know that my experience with maintenance and fixing appliances has been very satisfactory.  Placed an email at 7:30am, got a response back within an hour, and no more than 30 min, I got a technician already helping me out and resolving the problem (Washing machine)

Thanks a lot for your prompt response!
--- End Of Update ---

This review My experience so far with Valentia. I have been living here for over 6 weeks, the following are my mere observations.

The place:
- It is comfortable, UTC it is known for having such a peaceful environment and cozy accommodations.

- It is located right next to Noble park and Library which is very convenient to go for a walk or find resources if you need.  With COVID been active, it is difficult to utilize such resources, but it makes it livable.

- The staff (both office and maintenance) are very helpful and will go beyond their line of duty to accommodate you.

The Good:
- Peace of mind is achievable in here.
- Work from home is a very good option
- Plaza, Deli, Coffee shops within walking distance
- Renaissance area offers luxurious views and walking paths.
- If you want a place with enough natural light, then you must come live here!
- You can find parking in/out/around the location!

The bad:
- (For smokers)  You cant smoke around the area or in your place, you need to get out of the premises
- Price you may not find it enticing, however with the deal of one month off it just makes it a steal of a deal.
- Certain units may come with carpet, however the staff is more than willing to accommodate you to find the unit it matches your needs.

Overall:
- I would strongly recommend this place to all those individuals who work from home, love natural light in the mornings, like the high ceilings in the unit, and want to find peace of mind during this aggravating moments.

Recommendation:
- Once this is over, for new tenants like me please let me/us know of the accommodations that are available for use and where we can find them.  Had a little trouble finding out where the recycling dumpster was located.< /review>< name>

<Text>It’s been 2 years since I moved to the Valentia and I am so glad I did! I cannot recommend this community enough! If you are looking for a quiet and friendly environment, then you will definitely want to check out the Valentia! What really stands out for me is the team of staff. Everyone is so nice and eager to help!!! I have chemical sensitivities and they have been so accommodating, even switching the cleaning products in the common areas to non-toxic ones just for me! They know all of their residents really well and are so great!!! The apartments themselves have high ceilings and thick walls. I was looking for a community that was quiet since I am in med school which can be hard to find in a city. Not only is the community quiet but the apartments themselves have thick walls and high ceilings.  The location is ideal being very close to the highway and UTC area. It’s also located right next to Nobel Athletic Park where you can find sports fields, basketball courts, library, dog parks and rec center. It’s a great place to workout and enjoy the day! I highly recommend looking at the Valentia! I am grateful to have found such a friendly and beautiful environment to live!</Text>< date>

She, as well as everyone else I met in the leasing office, was very sincere and available. The apartment is very well priced for its size and has a wicked nice aesthetic. I highly recommend Valentia Apartments if you're looking for an easy, painless way to get a high quality place.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>{'time': 1598026844561, 'text': "Hi Jake!

<text>We are current residents at Valentia Apartments. We recently put in a work request to fix our refrigerator, microwave and thermostat.
The request was worked upon immediately with timely updates on arrival and repair time. The items were replaced with brand new items. Also received the Nest thermostat instead of the regular digital thermostat (old one was bad).
I would like to thank Miguel and Cesar who were really swift with the replacement of items and stayed and made sure everything worked after installation. Kudos to them.

Thanks,

This is a long overdue review for Valentia Apartments and the excellent staff that manage and work there. In the office Danielle, Stephanie, Vince, and Monica go above and beyond the call for tenants. We have been living here for about a year and a half, and their helpful and friendly service and tenant support has been the best we have experienced renting ever, by far!
They are quick to respond and have kept everything working and functional despite the challenges arising during this current Covid pandemic. Cesar and his crew in maintenance are also the best we have experienced. They are extremely quick, reliable, friendly, clean and especially efficient in getting repairs completed. For example, plumbing issue was fixed within 24 hours of  giving them notice in the middle of a pandemic no less.
We have found the apartments  clean, well-maintained, relatively quiet, safe, airy, and a great balcony.   It's in a great location too.  Nobel  park has been a great place to walk our dog and for us! It's also close to work and UCSD.. We highly recommend these apartments, especially in regard to the great staff.< /text>

<pictures>None<//pictures><Review>I would like to start of this review by clarifying that I was not a resident, but an employee at the Valentia Leasing Office. Therefore, I saw all the behind the scenes of what happens when people rent apartments and when residents call in with their concerns. From the start, I was trained to put the concerns of residents at high priority and comply with complete transparency to prospective tenants. Danielle, the community manager, has been in the business for a very longtime and she takes great pride in making sure her community is running smoothly and fair for ALL. Stephanie and Vincent also represent how much Valentia values delivering great customer service as the team is super attentive and eager to help anyone. In addition, if you are a current resident or in process of becoming one, you can count on Cesar and the whole maintenance team responding and fixing your concerns in a timely manner.

Although my time at Valentia was short, I learned a lot about honesty and professionalism. I was glad to work alongside a team who took their obstacles and turned them into learning lessons!</Review><user_name>Monica Papaya< /user_name></record>

In our transition from selling our larger home to buying a smaller condo,  our renting and staying in Valentia Apartments, made this experience much more easy for us to endure; and this is thanks to the wonderful people that run Valentia Apartments  that  helped us ease the ordeal and made us feel that we were still living in the comfort of our home.
Special thanks to Stephanie for all the help she gave to us, we will miss her.

My roommate and I lived here for about a year and we loved it! Some highlights are the beautiful pool/spa areas throughout the property, super spacious private patios (we fit a hammock on ours and it was so peaceful ☺️), and a perfect location close to Nobel Park and the UTC Mall! Management is very receptive and thoughtful. Danielle was always happy to address any concerns and the maintenance crew was so helpful any time we needed something fixed. The staff also took appropriate steps to protect residents during the COVID-19 pandemic.

UPDATE: I moved out of Valentia a few months ago. Recently, I ordered a package and accidentally had it shipped to my old apartment in Valentia. I reached out to Danielle to see if she could help me retrieve my package and she’s been SO helpful in this process (even though I’m no longer a resident)!! I’m so happy to see that the staff genuinely cares about current (and past) residents and that is a rare thing to find in most large apartment complexes.< /Review>

<Review>Valentia is quite amazing, one of the best communities in UTC and beyond. Living here for 3+ years in two different apartments, we love its excellent location and friendly, caring staff. The community is clean, well kept, and they're trying very hard to improve it even further.

The maintenance team is great - Miguel, Cesar, and Sam are always professional, friendly, and super quick to solve any issues (and in Covid times, they do that in full PPE). I appreciate their hard work.

Danielle, Stephanie, and Vince at the leasing office do a superb job and are always there for you if you need anything. People who work here actually live here, and it shows - it does feel like a real family business.

Highly recommended.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

The grounds and all amenities are immaculately maintained; any request for maintenance or service have been promptly addressed; and recently, due to the fiscal impact COVID-19 has had upon their residents, Shea Properties has kindly offered considerable latitude and flexibility in lease payment options to ensure residents can remain safely in their homes. I am extremely happy living here, and would highly recommend Shea Properties as an optimal community living choice within San Diego.</text>< username>

My husband and I moved here in May and are happy with the complex. Our maintenance guy, Cesar, is very helpful, and fixes whatever issues we have quickly, is polite, and wears all the protective gear (mask, and shoe coverings). We really appreciate it!</Review>

Moved in in August and have loved it since. It's a very beautiful place and the staff is very helpful. As a matter of fact, Danielle has given me some tips about things to do in San Diego since I moved in, even during this pandemic. Haven't had any maintenance issues so far, so we'll how that goes...< /Review>

<Text>I've been living here for years, in fact in two different units. This is the longest I've lived in the same complex and It's mostly because of the people help making living here a success. Danielle and her staff are awesome. That say it takes a village... well this is a pretty special village to be a part of!

UPDATE: It's February 2021 and we all know that the last 12 months have been challenging due to the pandemic. I wanted to add a huge shoutout to Danielle and her team. They have gone above and beyond to keep us safe and accommodate special needs during the pandemic! Thank you!</Text>< Gmap_id>

<Review>The team at Valentia are professionals who take pride in meeting the needs of the residents promptly and providing high quality service. It is a fantastic, clean, and quiet place to live. The park across the street is perfect for children, or anyone wanting to exercise outdoors. I would highly recommend living here as Danielle, Stephanie, Vincent, and Monica are an excellent team.< /Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
I am still fairly new to Valentina apartments and La Jolla area, however I have nothing but great things to say about Valentina. The complex is located right next to a large recreational park with a library, two fields, dog park, and playground which is great for family and friends. The neighborhood is wonderful for walking your dog or going out for a run and there is a small town center with a CVS only a ten minute walk away if you like coffee and trying out new food. I am so lucky to have found this place during a rent special they had and grateful for leasing agent Vincent who made the process a breeze while following COVID guidelines and always being available and thoroughly answering all my questions. I love the layout of my  apartment especially the master bedroom/bathroom. I also love the wood flooring and in unit washer/dryer which was a must for me. Parking is not an issue especially since there are underground parking garages. I am not too far from work and only takes three minutes to get to the highway. I am absolutely in love with the area and very happy for moving here. Big thank you to Vincent!< /Review>

I moved into this community eight years ago this November though it feels not so long ago. Stephanie & Danielle were really helpful in showing the apartments that met my requirements, including transition. The property has many amenities including racket ball, swimming pool and gym. It is also close to Nobel park for walk/ jog/ soccer/ soft ball and SD library to spend some quite time reading. UTC mall is also walking distance away and caters to the local populous with various shopping and eateries. La Jolla/ Torrey Pines beaches are 15 mins away to enjoy. I also benefitted on my commute to Sorrento Valley for work.

Occasional maintenance requests were handily addressed by Caesar and  team. They are friendly, diligent and always ready to help out. Caesar has been with Valentia for many years and is very resourceful.

We have many memories in the community with friends and family over the years. Our experiences are fondly remembered in Valentia, La Jolla and San Diego! Highly recommend:)<//Text>

We have been living in VALENTIA apartments for more than four years now, in three different apartments. We are a family with three kids and the place has been perfect for our needs. Both me and my wife work from home, so we spend all of our days here too. We really appreciate the great luxury quality of the apartments and the exceptional location in UTC - it is simply excellent, with so many green parks and sports fields and walking trails around. It is an absolutely lovely walk from here to UTC Westfield shopping mall, we really enjoy it. And living in VALENTIA gives the unique peace of mind - someone else takes care of every detail about electric appliances, utilities, etc. The leasing office staff and maintenance crew are extremely kind and responsive, they have always delivered a really professional and enjoyable service to my family needs here. We can focus on our work and life, not bothering about anything. It is also exceptionally quiet here - we lived in Forrest Hills in New York before that.... well, here is a quiet paradise. Before COVID we also appreciated very much the jacuzzi, the BBQs, the swimming pools... we really miss that now. If you are an active person who loves to walk and run around and go out with your dog, there is no better place than VALENTIA in UTC!!! We are really happy here, I would 100% recommend it to everyone.<//review>

The Valentia Apartments in La Jolla have been a wonderful place to call home for the past several years. I have seen this community blossom and I am a very proud resident. Their quick response to Covid 19 was not only incredibly professional, but it reinstated my belief that their staff truly cares for its residents. I am extremely excited for the reopening of the pools, and hope that the food trucks return shortly!</Text>

<Text>I looked at eight properties before finding the Valentia.  I have been here for a year and could not be happier.  The amenities are great (pools, hot tubs, gym, racket ball courts, recreation room, business center). The neighborhood is quiet and the location is perfect, within the "golden triangle" and it is directly across a park, the Nobel Athletic Field, also not far from UCSD campus but not too close.
We are around the corner from the 805, though you cannot hear the freeway.  We are a 10 minute walk to Westfield UTC, 10 minutes by car to Vons, Ralphs, Whole Food's and TJ's.  My apartment is spacious, has a balcony, in unit washer/dryer and there is a lot of parking, three options to be exact (garage, compound, street).  Lastly, the staff is friendly and quick to address all of our problems. I look forward to living here as long as I am in San Diego:)</Text>< Date>

I have lived here for about a month-and-a-half and have really enjoyed it. Today though, I had wonderful wonderful experience. Yesterday, I put a bag of trash down the chute.

A half hour after talking to Danielle in the office Cesar Lopez had retrieved the bag and I had my identification and cash back in hand.

I moved in to Valentia apts recently and Monica (and Danielle also) were very helpful. Monica went above and beyond to keep track of things and make sure all was in order for me. Since I was covering for two areas with a change of jobs and long distance move that was much appreciated. She was professional and pleasant and knowledgeable. Nice apts and had a special running which helps with $$. Close to work and shopping and vibrant area. Marine base nearby can be noisy with flight training but that stops at night fortunately. We salute our military.
Underground parking is good and apts have some nice amenities. Have not had anything repaired yet although a call was put in to fix/check some items so cannot comment on maintenance staff.
During the COVID-19 pandemic is was terrific to get someone on the phone who was helpful and responsive. Thank you !!<//text>

Three things I like about this place:
1) very helpful staff.
2) Quick responses for maintenance  request.
3) The location: it's close to UTC shopping centre. And It's located in a quiet neighbourhood.< /Text>

We've been renting here for almost 3 years and I can't remember any major issue with the management office or with the utilities providers. The family who occupied the apartment we moved-in to had lived there for 7 years - for us that was a very good sign that fulfilled itself during our stay. Danielle, Vince, and Stephanie from the office are all very helpful and polite. Valentia's upgrading their internet to fiber and tiding up the common areas this summer, so it should become even better. The maintenance guys (Cezar, Ramel, and Miguel) are more than helpful and fix any issues fast and professionally. Thanks guys!< /text>< gmap_id>

This is a wonderful place to live. Sure you have to lug ur groceries up the elevator and at first you get a little lost trying to see how to walk back to your home after leaving the park but the parking spot is gated and the trash shoot is right by the elevator so it won't pile up in your kitchen haha. The pool is always clean and although it's at a section where its surrounded by porches I did not see any or feel any creepy people watching the pool. The mail is kinda a hassle though. All the mail is received at the front just before the pool. Ample parking is there and of course you have your set of keys. The closest big grocery store I loved going to was Ralps. My kitchen had big tall kitchen cabinets. I noticed people left their shoes outside. Everything was gated.<//text>

When we first moved in 2 years ago this place was great. Staff was helpful, maintenance was fast, and residents were mainly young adults and families. Over the past year that has changed a lot.

In the past year this place has become very ghetto. Lots of college kids moved in so there is loud music, slamming doors, parties, and loud fighting/screaming constantly and it lasts well into the early morning hours. This isn't just on weekends either, it's a daily occurrence.

Maintenance is no longer helpful. If you need something and schedule an appointment most times they will not call or show when they are supposed to and you'll have to call to find out why. The last time this happened to us they claimed it took over a week to make a repair because they didn't have the parts. No one called to let us know they wouldn't be coming out when scheduled, we had to call them. A week later when the maintenance was rescheduled we had to call again because no one showed up. When they finally did show they came with a used part from another apartment that had food and dirt on it. They didn't order anything, just ripped the part from another apartment and brought it to ours.

We've struggled with gnats and silverfish since moving in and have asked numerous times for this to be taken care of. Supposedly someone came out and sprayed our apartment, but the bugs are still here. There was also black mold on our patio leading to the gnat problem which comes back once a month and we have to constantly bleach the patio.

The office staff when we moved in was extremely helpful, but over the past year has stopped caring. I had to go down to the office to let them know I'd be making a late payment since we had to fly to another state for a funeral and when I told them this they said "you'll be receiving a letter with your late fees you'll need to pay." Really? You can't waive the fees for one month for someone that had never paid rent late and was going out of town for a funeral? They refuse to work with you and the letter you receive with the late fees also tells you you have 3 days to pay or they will evacuate you from your apartment.

The apartments themselves are huge. High ceilings, large patio, living room, and bedroom, but tiny bathroom and kitchen. There is hardly any storage too. Parking has always been a nightmare. Parking spots in the garage are so small you can't get in or out of your car of someone parks next to you and people constantly park in the wrong spot or park in two spots since the parking is so tight.

Rental rates consistently go up $150-$200 each time your lease needs renewed. Since the office has stopped caring and maintenance rarely does anything the best I can figure is the rising cost is due to the landscaping they do on a daily basis. Every single day there is someone cutting the grass, trimming the bushes, or blowing the sidewalks clean.

Overall I'd say the apartments are a decent size, but unless you don't mind the noise I wouldn't suggest living here. This is also one if the most expensive complexes in the area.

UPDATE: After moving out of this complex I'd say don't bother. Upon move out we were sent a bill for an additional $393 that the complex stated we owed on top of the $400 deposit we had already given them. When I added up the numbers on the estimate they sent, I noticed there was an almost $80 difference in the amount I got and the amount they said we owed. We were told in our pre-inspection that we wouldn't be charged for cleaning and that one room of carpet would need to be replaced, yet the estimate was charging us $110 for a cleaning fee and $502.76 for a full apartment carpet replace. When I called to dispute this I was told the cleaning was common practice and that they can't only replace carpet in one room. The bill was then sent to collections a couple of days later, we weren't even given a chance to dispute the charges or pay the bill. Save yourself the headache and stay far away from this place!</Text>

Great place overall. Convenient location, near CVS/Pharmacy, not too far from the ocean, but secluded enough for a quiet living. Parking can be a little hard late hours, but thats typical anywhere. They have underground garages that come with ea. apartment. Front desk people are nice overall.

But the best part about living here in my opinion, is the Maintenance team. They are so awesome, they will fix anything and respond so fast. Not sure why, but that's such a big thing for me i guess! I've lived here for almost 3 years and love it.

Amicable community, nice people, located next to a huge park with activities and playgrounds for kids.

Suprised to see only 3.3 stars! It's a bit more than some places, but you pay for what you get I believe. As far as value, they're wonderful.</Review>

I moved in the valentia from another condo building in los Angeles, and after about a month I kept receiving notices from management saying I had to stop smoking marijuana on my balcony, now,I do have a license for my illness, and I also received another notice saying I had loud partiesand they had to stop. Completely not what I expected from asocal condo building.</Review>

It was my first time going to this market. WORSE DECISION EVER! The Owner was rude. He was not able to direct me to the item I was looking for. It seemed like I bugged him when I asked  him where I could find some cleaning supplies. I also wanted to purchase  some meat from their but the prices were out of control. It was Honestly  the worst  experience ever. I would rather drive farther to get what I need that to go back there again.<//Text>

Outside of that jerk everything is fine.

But if you don't want to have a bad time, avoid going in when you see the owner in the store.

El señor es un grosero y un metiche con los clientes, su familia lo tiene que convencer de que ya descanse porque va a la tienda a sacar todas sus frustraciones, muy mal educado.
Fuera de ese patán todo está bien.

<review>(Translated by Google) Everything is expensive and the meat is ugly because they have it for several days and without freezing and some canned things have passed them. He rented for 80 dollars a month and now he rents them at $ 120 as he knows that people have nowhere to leave their cars, they take advantage of it and the very expensive rents are well designed by those who, the more they have, the more they want, and the shame is that they are Latino Hispanic and they don't feel sorry of Hispanics ...

(Original)

(Translated by Google) This store charges $ 1.50 when you want cash from your own debit card. This is a robbery, since the bank does not charge this transaction. They are only taking advantage of people who do not know. What a bad blood that the Mexicans themselves take advantage of their countrymen. That is why the poor get poorer and the rich richer.

Que mala sangre que los mismo mexicanos se aprovechen de sus paisanos. Por eso el pobre se hace mas pobre y el rico mas rico.

(Translated by Google) Their prices are very high, I only go there when I am in a hurry and I cannot go to another place, besides being very offensive because they follow you while you are in the store and do not allow you to pass a bag and you have to leave it at the door where they could take it because it is in step

(Original)
Sus precios son muy elevados, solo voy ahí cuando tengo prisa y no puedo ir a otro lugar, además de ser muy ofensivos por que te siguen mientras estas en la tienda y no te permiten pasar una bolsa y la tienes que dejar en la puerta donde podrían tomarla por que está al paso< /Text>

<Review>Save your time and money, these people have the worst customer service in the industry, package to this date has not been delivered to my customer and sounds like the $7,000 pizza oven has been lost, Why am I not surprised after getting the run around for over 3 weeks.< /Review>< time>

Horrible company to use for shipping. They don’t know how to coordinate with the third party that they use to deliver the orders they pick from companies. Shame on the management.</Review>

<review>DO NOT SHIP WITH DAYLIGHT TRANSPORT. We shipped with them 1 time and our shipment showed up to our customer like this and they refuse to take responsibility. Shrink wrap completely removed, damaged product and boxes that clearly fell off and were re-stacked UPSIDE DOWN. We will never ship with this carrier again, we'll stick with CTI.</review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNRfulf-to8bwgnzWDiQ6SnRlDWri9rD48SYBtx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x80dcb4ad796ac037:0xedaca0f1a4c36d6e< /gmap_id></record>

<Text>This company claims to offer faster shipping at a premium price but then always seems to be delayed and deliver at most a day before the cheapest economy carrier. Save your money and just go with another carrier since the transit times they advertise are never real!!! 4-5 transit from Chicago when they say 2 days coast to coast. What joke. Freight will sit waiting to be unloaded at the terminal for two days<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Big Facility, nice break room, bathrooms are clean 90 % of the time. Waiting is perhaps the only issue here. But over all, it's a pick up and drop off that I don't mind coming too.</text>

NEVER write reviews but this was an all around horrible experience. I went in for a tune up. Everyone was super kind and knowledgeable. Two tubes replaced told didn't need new tires and had brake pad replaced. I ride apx 10 miles a day so its important that my bike work properly. A couple of days later I went in for another flat tire (thorn in tire). Different guy told me I needed new tires because mine were worn out. I only got one new tire due to financial hardship from COVID + labor cost. A couple days later the chain started making noise that wasnt normal. Brought it in, guy said it was put on too tight (from when they replaced the tire). He loosened it and said it was fine. Took it out and it was making the same noise. About mile 5 into my ride I got a flat (NOT their fault). I came back in to get a new tire (4th visit). I said that I needed a new tire and that it was still making that noise. Looked at it, told me my chain was dry and I should get a new one but this would last a couple of months. Them greasing it was 5 new chain was 13. Told them to replace it. I had JUST been in maybe 3 hours prior about the chain and was told everything was fine. Told the older gentleman I'd been there 4 times and he said "I told you to change the tire." I had explained that it was the chain. Didnt take me seriously. What could have been 50 dollars (in total) turned into well over 100. Be careful and do your research before going here.</Review>

Can't test ride the bicycles. I went in looking to check out some bicycles, but they don't let you test ride any of the bikes because then they won't be "new" anymore. I've never had this issue at any other bike shop.

Otherwise, it seemed like they had cool things and friendly staff, just the no test ride policy got me annoyed.< /review>

Quick, quality service and really affordable. Changed a tube in minutes.  One star deduction is only because parking is limited to street parking, so i had to drive around several times and eventually just parked a bit away. That is likely mitigated by going at certain times of the day that aren't as busy.</review>

<rate>1<//rate><Text>This shop sold me a defective tube for my tire.  It would not hold air.  When i called them the manager stated that they would not refund this because it would be impossible to determine if i did the damage or the item was defective.  I called them only 45 min. After my purchase.  It was kind of offensive that they would imply that i was trying to cheat them out of $3.50.  The lady I spoke to on the phone was quite rude.  Anyways, there are plenty of bike shops in the area.  No need to go to this one.  I will never go back!< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Great shop, prices are very appealing, got some tires there and also tubes - cheapest I saw, and I've been to like 8 other bike shops. Don't forget they're closed on Tuesdays!< /Text>

A lot of restaurants have disappointed me for takeout this year, this was not one of them. First time trying them today and it was really nice,. Made my day actually, you guys have a customer for life. The food was great, they didn't screw you on the portion size and they give you this amazing complimentary bread with this unbelievably good roasted tomato spread. and also a delicious almond pastry desert thing on the house!</review>

<Text>In case you didn't know...you can order off menu grilled cheese.

I had an amazing double double minus the meat. Of course I ordered animal style plus raw onions. Just love grilled onions pickles!

I always order the fresh cut fries no salt... Mmmmnn

Wish I could rate 7 stars. I’ve been here many times over the years and at this point, I’ve basically tried everything on the menu and been delighted with everything. The squid ink pasta is a particular favorite. Also notable is the wine selection, friendly staff, and great ambiance. Love the outdoor feel, wish I could eat here everyday.<//text>

Good quality Italian food. Great service. If you want an impressive atmosphere, this is not the place. The place is comfortable and casual and looks like it has been assembled from pieces collected at yard sales. With that in mind, Speranza is unique and a value for an evening meal. I would not recommend bringing small children though. Reasonably priced but remember this is LA.<//Text>

Only thing that I cannot comment on is the dessert since I am very sensitive to sugars I tend to stay away. This restaurant is worth it. It is always crowded but not too crowded and certainly not too noisy. It is a wonderful restaurant for a nice date or for a nice dinner out with friends/family. It is really not great for children. I highly recommend.< /Review><pics>None</pics>< response>

One of the best dining experiences I've ever had. Food is fresh, authentic, and full of flavor. The atmosphere is cozy, relaxed, and matches the vibe of the service. Our server, Michael, was one of the most delightful people I've encountered in the restaurant business. He was knowledgeable, unafraid to give genuine recommendations, and incredibly personable. I wish I lived in LA; if I did, I would frequent this place for the amazing food, atmosphere, and service.<//review>

<rate>1</rate><text>It’s absurd that they only allow you to pay with maximum 3 credit cards. We were a big party and spent a lot of money. Food was ok, nothing great. The pesto was mediocre at best.
Service was very slow to bring the food and VERY slow when we wanted to pay the check.
At the end the waiter came to find us at the door and was quite rude because he thought we didn't leave tip (maybe we should have).
Of course we did leave tip, it was included in the totals.
In general a bad experience, expensive, average food and slow service.<//text>< Pics>

Food was great.  But even McDonald's spends the money on artificial sweeteners for their customers who can't use sugar.  This restaurant requires that you bring your own. With the price of their food they could afford it.< /Text>

<Review>Great ambiance, love the trees and outdoor forest feel. Had very nice service. The food was excellent going in-- we overate and had a nice time. The only draw back was that both of us felt gassy and bad afterwards and not just from overeating. I think there's an abundance of onions in the sauces or garlic perhaps. I'll still go back. Will just try to side step the tomato sauces.< /Review><Date>1525098182019</Date>< rating>

Speranza is located neatly on a corner on Hyperion Ave in Silver Lake. Surrounded by Trader Joe's, and Hyperion Public, it is very easy to miss this place. The restaurant is very inconspicuous and they pride themselves on being unassuming to the public eye.

The pastas are homemade and the portions are heavy. One bowl will fill you up nicely.

Service = wonderful.
Atmosphere = intimate.
Prices = inexpensive.

Good wine list too.</Text>

< Review>
Nice evening and nice dinner.
Got a table in the back, the lush garden.
Our server was very helpful with wine recommendations.
I got the endive and gorgonzola cheese salad with walnuts.
The bread and olive oil were good.
Salad was just OK.
The Old Vine Zinfandel was delicious.
I got the swordfish and arugula.
Others got pasta with bolognese sauce, pasta with clams and garlic, and the squid ink pasta.
Everything was delicious. Of course we ordered the pasta al dente, and dinner was delicious. Dessert was tiramisu, And it was OK.
Definitely worth coming back.
Service and atmosphere made the evening so enjoyable.</Review>

Very cute, mostly outdoor restaurant this place is intimate yet funky, romantic yet casual and literally the perfect restaurant no matter the occasion!
My favourite dish on the menu is the squid ink pasta- super flavorful and really interesting! The wait staff always give you a nod of approval if you pick this menu item! They also have a crazy good bruschetta appetizer special. The cheese goes perfectly with the bread they serve when you first sit down.
Grab a bottle of wine, some food and enjoy this absolute GEM!</Review>< Pics>

This was my second time coming here. I would’ve given it a 5 star because the food and there service is amazing. But Yesterday me, my boyfriend and my mother in law had dinner. As we were leaving our server literally chased us down the street to see if we had left a tip. Of course we did!! ($20). I couldnt believe it, I felt so embarrassed 😔</review>

Simply overpriced pasta thrown in a bowl, with no presentation. Maybe this is what's expected in a trendy L.A. restaurant, but it wouldn't fly in many other places around the world. Nothing special, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.</review>

Hot out the oven house made baguettes that just melts in your mouth. My friend and I ended up eating an entire loaf by the end. The squid ink pasta is some of the best I've had. The linguini with clams comes with a delicious garlicky broth that almost reminds me of a ramen dish.   Such a serene outdoor setting with surrounding foliage. Must try.< /Review>< rate>

I have enjoyed dining at Speranza for over a year.  My fav meal is the homemade Fettuccine Mare e Terra and have eaten it happily 5 - 6 times.  Unfortunately the 2 star review stems from the last time I dined there on Friday July 22, 2016.  I became deadly ill from a shrimp I had eaten.  My blood pressure dropped and I could not even stand up for fear of collapsing.  My friend said my face was pasty and my lips had turned white.  I DID consider 911.  Did the manager come over and ask how I was?  Not exactly,  he was told what had happened - yes, I vomited at the table - and came over with Clorox wipes in hand.  Hmmmm.  I was considerate enough that I was discreet, it was off to the side, and I saved the plant.  Yet never did he speak to me face to face with comforting words, offer to comp my dinner or offer a discount on a future meal.  Nothing!  This is unprofessional and humanely inconsiderate.  These are the risks we take dining out I realize and I'm in no need for anything free but unfortunately my last meal and the manager of Speranza have left a permanent bad taste in my mouth.< /text>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><text>I chose this place based on good reviews and nice photos - I was looking for a new place to try out in Los Feliz that was open late, had a patio, and good wine. Went with a couple of friends and had a great evening. Food was good (a little under salted), atmosphere was adorable and it was an overall great experience. Their patio is very intimate, it feels like you walked into someone's backyard, the staff is super friendly and they had a great selection of wines. Will be coming back!</text><gmap_id>0x80c2c0cbcb1ed9e7:0x45c28ec6f5b9b9c2< /gmap_id><Date>1436156835964</Date>< Resp>

We showed up around 6:30 with our 6 month old baby. The restaurant was nearly empty with only one family sitting at a table. They asked if we had a reservation and we didn't. It was a Wednesday night and again, place looked empty. They said "well we will need to put you somewhere out here or you can sit inside. It was very dark outside so I opted to sit inside since I needed to have enough light to feed my baby. We got seated inside and could barely have s conversation over the music- they were blasting Katy Perry (???) I even got a little concerned about my baby's eardrums so we asked if we could sit near a window outside so that we had some visibility. They essentially said no. I was so confused!! Again they had ONE family that evening and even if they had reservations coming in for the night there's no way they couldnt serve a family of three seated anywhere in their restaurant. It's not like they didn't have room. The waiters seemed like teenagers follow orders instead of entertaining and accommodating guests. I believe if the owners were there they'd have been very upset with how inflexible they were being and probably very embarrassed about the blasting music. I live in the area and I will not be recommending this place to anyone... Especially with kids.</Review>

I got some simple penne with pomodoro sauce to go.  When I opened the container at home, I was overpowered by the garlic.  I have spent time in Italy, and I don't ever remember thinking, "My God, there is way to much garlic in this."  That's a very American thing.  So, if you like tons of garlic, you'll love this.  Me.....not so much.<//Text>

<text>All good , the Tête de Moine was a revelation. I always forget about this place and so I get to rediscover it constantly. It was a great place to hunker down while the Seige of Trader Joe's dragged on.  The service is really outstanding, too< /text>< date>

<text>To begin, we where sat at a dirty table. The servers hardly came to accommodate us. There are alot of bugs falling on one's table,  due to the whole outside garden of plants and trees around all the tables. The pasta was fairly priced for there portions, but dry and hardly any flavor.< /text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

I have been a customer of Amerigas for many years. Their customer services never seems to amaze me. Its HORRIBLE! There is always some kind of new charge you are not aware of I do not recommend them. Pay more $ somewhere else because with Amerigas you will end up paying more anyways.</text>

So I waited there to write this google review and a lady shows up and tells me they are not open to public.
This company is not professional at all.

<text>When I called the office to confirm a delivery date they were polite and helpful. When the delivery person came he was prompt, polite, and efficient. Finally, when the bill posted on the website, it was easy to pay.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80c36e21a7cf87eb:0x2d91e3057da979fb<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Customer service was not good. I came all the way from the south side of Hesperia. Called first and the call sent to Bakersfield so I could not talk to no one there. When I finally showed up the only person they have to fill tanks was out and would be gone for an hour. Drove out for nothing. Will never be back here<//Review>

Stopped in while I was in town for business. Its obvious its a local joint, loved the layout.  Food was very good, but my only compliant was service.  I had to go get my beer twice from the bar because they never checked on me.  Then it turns out they charged me for five beers instead of four because they got confused with me going to the bar.  Wasn't worth the effort to complain so I just paid it and left.   I would recommend but if your not a local, be prepared to be served as second class.< /Review>

Excellent Cobb Salad, but lacking in what makes a Cobb: no avocado, blue cheese crumbles, no olives.
Fries are classic fast deep fry type but tasty, same for the crispy Chicken Fingers.
Semi fast to-go service, however the 'tender left me with the impression I and my order were in his way, and he'd prefer I hurry up and leave. Well, don't take 20 min to make my food when the football game is on.<//text>

<text>The American Bull is a great place to dine or just hang out.   They have very loyal customers, which I now consider myself to be.   I love their food.  Their extensive menu offers something for everyone.  My favorite is their fish tacos.  Their burgers are very yummy too!  I strongly endorse “The Bull” and encourage everyone to visit them soon!< /text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

We came here because of the he reviews we read. We wanted a place with good food at a good price and it exceeded our expectations.  The staff treated us like we were regulars, and everyone was friendly.  There were lots of TV's with different sports shows and games to watch. We'll be back.<//review>

<Text>Everyone was super nice but the beer selection was very small. I ordered the chicken parmesan and it wasn't good at all. I think that's on me. I should have ordered bar food at a bar. I would totally go back to have hard drinks and chicken tenders though.< /Text>< pictures>

Why go to a generic chain when you can go to American Bull? Fantastic place to watch a game. I counted 21 TVs. Good bar food for fair prices. Good selection of beers on draft (including Pliny the Elder, last time I was there) and surprisingly good prices on bottles of wine. Service is really friendly and prompt as well. If it's a big game day, however, be sure to get there early if you want a seat--this place fills up.< /text>

Fun place, lots of screens to watch sports. Funny story: I ordered a beer from the on-tap menu, and it said in the description that the serving size was 11 ounces. It was served in a brandy snifter! Couldn't have been more than 5 oz. I complained and showed the waiter the menu, and he replaced it with tumbler with the right amount in it. But who does that? Otherwise a nice place. Good selection of appetizers and food.< /Review>

American Bull is a solid local bar with surprisingly great food and warm staff. It's a much older crowd, and they all seem to know each other and live in the area. I always order the sausage sandwich or Philly cheese steak, and they are consistently delicious. You can tell the food staff really puts effort into the food. If you're in the area and tired of the chain restaurant life, try this local place out!< /review>

<review>The drinks were pretty good. I had Tito's mule and it was good but nothing special. The food was just average. U had the turkey melt. It had a large amount of turkey, but because of that the turkey was cold and not nice and warm like you want it to be in a good melt. The atmosphere was great and the staff very friendly.  I would definitely give it another try and wouldn't be surprised if ordering a different meal would result in a rating of 4 Stars<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Once I walked in I was immediately welcomed with great service and much better food than any sports bar I have ever been to. I spent hours here and was treated well the entire time. I would highly recommend anyone takes a moment to stop by. Make sure you try the Lumpia, it is something special.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

Great dive bar in Burlingame. The wings are SUPER crispy and really tasty, the beer is flowing, and the rest of the food is what you'd expect from a pub. It's a casual spot to watch a game - if only they have a pool table.</Text>

When you think of Bar food you think just that. The food in this joint is way beyond bar food, the service is 5 stars. I have become a regular I have brought my wife and friends all the way from Santa Clara</Text>

Excellent spot to watch games, but the fact that you have to show up an hour early or be aggressive to get a seat makes you really question how much you value your time over the sports you watch. The food isn't top notch, but the service is great! Always kind people working and if you share a space, makes for some great conversation with new people.<//Review>

Had a fantastic time seeing the Warriors game with 15 screens around the place watching the Warriors challenge Clevelands..Good food. A bit too crispy, overcooked chicken wings. The Ribs were delish on the plate with fries or cole slaw. Mrs. Liz, the owner is very passionate and greets each table. It's important to serve her customers right!. She makes sure she gets everyone's name right! Haven't been there in 18 yrs! Live & friendly..Will go again next game on friday..</Text>

American Bull is my favorite sports bar on the Peninsula. Bold statement considering I've lived here my whole life. Here's why:
1. Tons of TVs showing all variety of sports.
2. Suuuuper laid back locals vibe. You can tell most of the customers are old time Burlingame/Millbrae regulars. No pretensions, come as you are.
3. Great food. I've only sampled a small portion of their extensive menu, simply because what I've tried is so good I want to keep eating it. They're known for their lumpia (which are great), but my current favorites are the fried green beans (so crispy) and the Cobb salad (hot bacon and chicken, super fresh)
4. Solid beer selection. Light beers, all the NorCal standards (Racer 5, Anchor, Sierra Nevada), and always a couple of different craft brews.
5. Friendly staff. They know all the regulars and are happy to chat with the patrons they don't know. I always feel welcome here.
6. Decor. Wood paneling, leather barstools, neon signs. Walking inside is like stepping back in time to the 70s or 80s.

If you're looking for a casual place to watch the game while enjoying some tasty food, go here. There's nowhere else nearby that even comes close.< /Review>

<review>My first experience is fantastic! Waited for about 15 minutes for my surgery appointment. The assistant is really nice and friendly. Jokes with you and make you feel comfortable. All staff are accommodating and helpful, and their price point is very good. I had to cancel my appointment from a different dental clinic as I was charged way too expensive, and move mine to them. Definitely will do more business with them. Definitely recommend.<//review><pics>None</pics><response>{'time': 1623352710926, 'text': 'We are so honored that you have joined our patient family!

Run as quick as you can from the Dental Center. At first in April, very friendly. Provided us our meeting schedule with the doctors and the doctors seem to know what they are talking about. We were denied by insurance 2 procedures. We asked for resubmission and doctor said the narrative will be sent professionally and with a note of urgency.  The nightmare starts: 1. Resubmissions never sent. 2. No way to verify resubmissions were sent as the dental office can't verify billing office who deals with sending to insurance the request. 3. So you call the dental office and they "reassure" you that it's been sent. 4. After many requests, personal visits, etc, we call the insurance company  and NEVER was the resubmission sent. 5. We communicated the fact to the dental office. They "assured me" that the office manager was on top of this and that a resubmission was sent. 6. I asked to verify this and office said they can only go with what the billing department says.. "HERE WE GO AGAIN". 7. Insurance said this resubmission can be sent electronically and be received in days. It's the end of the month, 12 days after this screwup and the insurance company still has no resubmission. We call the office, they will follow up. I sent 4 emails to Paula Office Manager and WC corporate office - NO RESPONSE OR ACKNOWLEDGMENT. It seems West Coast cares zero about the wellbeing of its patients. Total failure. Thought the doctors were good - but operations totally weak and inept.< /text>

<Review>Staffs are very accommodating and friendly! They will also guide you with your financing and insurance with very affordable prices you can pay monthly or apply with care credit. Unlike other dental offices I’ve been, they prioritize your need more than anything else.< /Review>< Pics>

This place is all about profit over patient care. They overbook. They have no idea who anyone within the office is. My friend went to that place even though I didn't like my experience and she confirmed it was not a good experience. There is a revolving door of "doctors" I've never been able to see the same one. If I try I come across a battle of rescheduled appointments. Out of the whole office maybe 3 faces are actually familiar and they seem to always be under scruitny to follow less than caring protocals.< /Text>

<Review>Fun people, laughed at my nervous jokes, and most of all made a treatment plan that was budget friendly and did the lengthy work first which had the pain and discomfort. Angelica, the Dentist, and rest of the staff are great. I'm looking forward to being in their care.<//Review><gmapID>0x80c2c41049fbdc6d:0xb9893dfca6d872ed</gmapID></record>

It’s ridiculous that you have to wait over an hour to be able to see the dentist. I don’t understand what’s the point in making an appointment if they are not going to see you at that time. People have stuff to do,and here they make you waist your time ..</text>

Everyone is a true professional at this dental office. The lady named Jasmine is a wonderful dental assistant. She is very kind and understanding she explained to me the steps for my procedure. The lady named Angelica helped me with my payment plan she is very knowledgeable. Look forward to going back. Thank You<//Review>

Every time I go in there for a simple x-ray, I never make it to the back of the office. I have things to get done in a day. Clearly, this place does not respect peoples time. I show up for my appointment, and I end up waiting for over an hour, and then I read the reviews. Some people have waited up to four hours for a simple x-ray. Further reviews showed that a lot of people complain about the work they get done on their teeth. I have read about people demanding refunds and I have read about others walking out of the office with pain. For me, it’s the simple fact that they are unorganized and inconsiderate of people’s time. I have never been to a dental office that makes people wait for hours just to go get an x-ray. Then I realized what the issue is. It’s their scheduling practices. Basically, for each appointment slot, they schedule six people at one time, when they probably only have one or two dentists working in the back. So it causes a major back up. Thus, it’s why people are waiting up to four hours just to get an x-ray. Today, I called my insurance provider and ask them to set me up with a new dental office. I’ve wasted enough time just waiting to get my teeth checked. If the name of this place comes up as a dental provider, kindly ask to be set up with another place.<//Review>

Despite so many negative reviews, I wanted to give this place a shot as it is one of the few clinics that sees patients on Saturdays. I had an appointment at 9AM & arrived at 8:45. I approached the front desk, they were busy looking for pens, so I signed in and waited. No one attended or checked in with me while I waited. At 9:30, I approached the desk again and asked if I had any paperwork to fill out. Not until I had re-approach them did I get attended. People who arrived after me got attended before me. I finally got checked in and got my x-rays done around 9:40. I was told to wait again and didn't go back in for my exam until 10:15 AM. I spent almost 3 hours there, most of which was just waiting, when I only went in for a dental exam and abrasion treatment .

The X-Ray technician and doctor were great and they attended me very well. I was just very frustrated with the waiting and wasting so much time when my appointment was at 9AM.</Text>

Great customer service. Friendly staff that walked me through the entire process and explained everything that would take place. The hygienist and the assistant  was professional, conversational, and helpful when discussing all of my options for optimal dental health.  I just love the deep cleaning procedure I had. All others were just as friendly and helpful. ☺️<//review>

<Review>Worse place EVER! We show up on time for my third appointment & wait for over 3 hours. Why give appointments if this place does not keep them. I bring my kids here & waiting around for so long gets them frustrated, hungry and annoyed. Don't go to this place, there are other dental clinics that keep their appointment. Also first appointment  waited 2 hours, second appointment they didn't bother to call us to let  us know that dentist called in. Wasted half day of Saturday. Do Not go to this place just like other reviews on Google. Don't waste your time.</Review></record>

I can tell from the waiting room that things can be hit or miss here. However, I have to say that my own experience has been excellent regarding quality of service and I'm happy to give kudos to Assistant Agnes and Dr. Anifa Krekian - such a pleasure to have had their help.<//text>

I thought this place was shady. Strip mall dentist? ugh. But they helped me with my pain. Great dentists. The crown they put on is strong and beautiful. Fits just right. I'll be going back to them if I have any future problems (hopefully, not any time soon ; )< /Review>

I found this location through my medical insurance, and it was a super convenient commute from my home. Aside from that, I came to get a consultation on some wisdom teeth are extractions, and the whole process from checking in and out was super smooth (COVID-19 regulations and all). The staff was accommodating throughout the entire time and encouraged questions if I had any. I left knowing exactly what would occur if I went forward with the procedure, and that’s the part that would bring me back here if anything else comes up.</Text>

Almost 2 hours and no service I lost a day of work for there bad customer service I definitely going to report this to my insurance company and look for a different dentist office but this time I’ll pay attention to the reviews…7/19/21 My appointment was at 11am and again bad service from the receptionist to the doctor and not even mention the office manager clinic very dirty if you really care about good customer service just go to California Dental have a really friendly staff and customer service the only reason I back to this office is because my insurance is HMO but definitely this is the last visit I really don’t care if I need to pay out of my pocket if is worth it DO NOT COME TO THIS OFFICE IF YOU DONT WANT TO WAIST YOUR TIME< /Review>< Pics>

The staff were very friendly and professional, im terrrrrified of dentists but Dr. Ali is definitely one of the best dentists ive had in a while. I didnt feel any pain or discomfort, they even played music while working on my teeth to help with my anxiety. Be aware though that there is a wait time. I waited about 2 hours to get seen but i honestly dont mind now that i know how great they are.<//text>

We were also told at 5:20pm that we would get called in 5 minutes, wait outside. We sat in our car, never got called, and saw them lock their doors for the day.

I walked in and wasn't greeted. I was only asked what type of dr I was there to see.
Within 5 minutes of arriving I overheard two different patients ask the front desk how much longer because they were waiting for a long time already.
The front desk could be more professional. I understand having an enjoyable work environment but when you have a waiting room full of patients waiting because the dr is backed up you should have to listen to the front desk singing songs.
When I left there was a woman who was asking how much longer because she had been waiting two hours already. I was trying to schedule an appt to come back and unfortunately the receptionist could not give me attention todo so as she kept being interrupted by other staff members.  There was confusion throughout the front office since the moment I arrived. I will not be going back.<//text>

<Review>——————————warning —————————
WORST DENTIST I ever bin to, I have bin here since 11am it’s about to be 3pm and they still haven’t received me. It’s absolutely absurd how They have people waiting for 4 hrs in the waiting room for a 40 min procedure. to top it off, I requested to get a root canal but they had me wait almost 2 months in pain for the specialist to show up to their office. Apparently she is there only once a month but yet 2 months has pass and I’m still waiting. They are very unorganized and they are not professionals don’t let their name fool you. I truly regret wasting my time and money in this dental office. Please save your self a headache and transfer to a different office.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>{'time': 1618858556027, 'text': 'We deeply apologize for the experience you had in our office, Daniel.

The 1st appointment I made for my toddler was over the phone and I reiterated how old she was to the receptionist. when I arrived 10min early for her 1st visit, I had already completed all paperwork and handed it to the front desk after signing in. It wasn't until 15min after her appt would have begun that I asked, "may I go back with my daughter when it's time?"  Than I was told, "oh, we need to reschedule your daughter bc the pediatric dentist isn't in today." I was soo upset on too many levels. Need I really explain??

So we reschedule for 3wks later on a day the pediatric dentist is there. Fast forward to yesterday... although arriving 15min early,  my 3yr old didn't get called in until 15min after her appointment time. We were told she had to go in by herself due to covid. I understand the times we're living in, but that's just not right for a little 3yr old!!!???? Going with a stranger by herself????  (Shaking my head). my daughter got xrays taken with a tech who than told us she had no cavities and then we were told that she was done for the day and would have to be scheduled later for her cleaning (apparently with the actual pediatric dentist who we had rescheduled for in the 1st place) on a later date "bc we needed an insurance authorization. " UGH!!!!! Very poor communication on every level! Soo disappointed bc the dentist herself has a good bio on their website and I would've loved for her to see my daughter but now I'm going elsewhere.</text>

I had to get a few procedures done this month so I was in and out of here quite a bit. Their business is built on making people wait. They overbook and squeeze a huge amount of appointments into timeslots. They cancelled my appointment twice. I waited an hour and a half for a cleaning (10 min procedure), while other people around me were complaining about their wait times. I had work, so I asked for a refund and left. I still had a root canal booked for later that week. When I came in for that, they got me in a chair immediately. Great! I thought. They did this because I had requested a refund. I know this because I heard them talking about me when they thought I had left, but whatever, I was glad to not wait for an hour +. After sitting for 15 minutes, somebody comes up and tells me that it'll actually be an hour before I can be seen. So they asked if I wanted to leave and get something to eat while I wait (I heard this script repeated to a bunch of other people waiting as well). I had enough. I asked for a refund, they tried to get me to stay, telling me they cancelled other appointments to bump me up, which I was not cool with. She said "ok, it'll just be a minute though, let me ask the doctor how long." I watched her walk over to the doctor who was mid operation. He said 30 minutes at least, then she walks back to me and says "he's ready now, we'll just seat you." I told her I heard him say 30 minutes and she just said "no he didn't." So I just got my refund and left. Really aggravating experience, which is a shame because the doctors did decent work when I managed to get fillings done earlier that month. As I left I realized the parking lot was full of people just waiting in their cars. Let me be clear though, the waiting (and lying) is a feature not a bug. Avoid this place.<//Text>

< Review>
This place should be closed down for good. No one has a clue what day it is, no one communicates with each other and I have been left in pain with a broken tooth. I have been here five times and only seen the doctor I was supposed to twice. On two occasions I was left outside waiting in my car for a ten minute call back - the first occasion I went in 45 minutes later, the second they forgot about us completely.

I made it clear to everyone there that I only wanted one specific doctor to work on my teeth as they are incredibly sensitive and he is the only person there who I felt comfortable with. Despite this, when I went in for a 2pm appointment the women at the front desk told me the doctor wasn’t in that day. When I asked when he called in to notify his absence, one woman said ‘yesterday’ and the woman next to her said ‘10am this morning.’ Regardless of whichever it was, his patients should have been notified of this. One of the women’s response we just ‘oh but we thought you’d just want the procedure over and done with’ despite me having made it very clear to all involved in multiple occasions that I do not want anyone but him coming near my mouth.

My husband and I have lost days’ of work and time because of the inefficiency and quite frankly insulting attitude of this practise. And here’s the part which blows my mind above all else:

I went in for the final procedure to have temporary crowns removed. I already have delicate teeth with previous repairs next to these two teeth (which the doctor understood and one reason I only wanted only him to work on them.)

Sure enough I am met by his assistant who asked me if I would like anaesthetic... not being a dental professional I asked if it was necessary and she said ‘no not really.’ And so I declined as I hate not being able to feel my face for six hours. She then proceeded to bash the temporary crowns off with a huge metal hammering device and not only does she knock off the temp crowns which she has to extract from the back of my throat, she destroys and breaks off half of the tooth next to them.

She had the audacity to pass me a mirror as I was in excruciating pain and ask what I thought, she didn’t even say anything about the other tooth she broke!! I was horrified!! She casually said ‘oh this happens sometimes..’ Meanwhile she rushes to get the doctor who should have done this all in the first place and he asks the woman why she didn’t give me anaesthetic as I was in a lot of pain. And if she was his assistant then he should have communicated to her previously that my other teeth are delicate.

The doctor rushed a repair on the tooth she broke and it looks nothing like the previous one. I asked them to try again but he didn’t have time so he offered me a free crown instead which would be impossible - as they know, I am moving to NC in a week.

I went back in today for a 12 pm appointment but at 12.45 I was told I would still have to wait another hour and a half. I told them not to bother and I would like a refund immediately for the $600 downpayment I made on $2000 crowns. This is mal practise. They did not administer anaesthetic and asked me, the patient, if it was necessary, and they have broken my tooth leaving me unable to smile properly or have it repaired. Conversations today are all recorded on both mine and my husband’s phones and if we do not receive a refund in the next 48 hours we will press charges.

I highly advise that anyone stays as far away from this dangerous establishment as possible. They do not care about your well-being and will end up leaving you in more pain than you were before you went in.

I will gladly share photos of the damage to anyone who reaches out.</Review>

Disorganized. If you have time to waste come here. I came here for a specific reason, also came the last time and same thing. I always try to give places second chance but this is the last time I come here. I can find somewhere a lot closer to home.<//Text>

The dentist Dr. Ali was nice to keep me in the loop with my teeth and super quick with my fillings. Marco the x-ray technician and who assisted Dr. Ali was super friendly which made me feel comfortable and less anxious (I hate the dentist). Val was nice too; the only complain that I have was when she was cleaning my teeth she kept spraying water on my face and inside my nose which was not comfortable at all. The wait time however, be ready to be there FOREVER. That’s the only reason I took a star away. Ever since I’ve been going there (YEARS) there’s always a very very long wait.< /Text>< Pics>

<Review>I went in for severe pain due to a tooth infection from a broken tooth. The staff was very nice and  welcoming. Sadly I haven't been to the dentist in quite a while so it I was kind of scared. I felt at ease and the staff went above and beyond to help me out and they actually seemed to care.</Review>< Time>

Clearly,  is just business . I don't think he cared or they care or know what they are doing half of the time(staff) is clueless. And doesn't informed the problem on procedures to be done.  You have to keep asking, and they have you filled patients paper work , that had been previously done. No care for patient. Or Covid-19 distancing.  To many people on site when patients are being worked on, not enough protection for minors. I'm currently working on moving to another provider. I accidentally ran into this place when I had a dentis emergency need, little did I think it was going to be a horror house, and horrible experience Having said that, there are a few workers who do try, and I mean try to answer your questions, but seriously there are few professionals on site. To answer your concerns.  Like I said plain business. I get it but even in business,  when you buy something you ask questions.  And get  professionals to hear your concerns.  I dislike this place so bad.
Hope, I can find a new dentist asap

Experience was much better this time!  We didn’t have to wait for hours to be called! But at one point I felt there were too many people in the waiting area. This was my elderly moms appointment and after waiting for half an hour, I was going to take my mom out and hdd as ve her wait in the car!  But when I checked with the receptionist she said they were going to call her soon!  So we waited a few more minutes and then they called her!! Thank you!<//review>

Very nice people but waited a very long time to be seen. I was there for about 3 1/2 hours. I had a tooth pulled and it's too soon to know how it will turn out. Also I heard the doctor tell the assitant to give me the directions she had just told me but that didn't happen so I am hoping I am remembering everything she said. Also I think the stitches came loose at least the knot because I had to cut it off.< /Review>

My appointment was at 12 at 2Pm they finally Started looking at my teeth. I wasted 4 hours at the dentist when the whole actual procedure was less than 30 min. Just three hours of waiting and waiting. If they can not see you at the time they say why even have an appointment. Nobody was checking temps and people were not 6 feet away. The procedure it’s self was smooth. But I didn’t really get explained to about what happen<//text>

Dental Center is un-beatable.  From the personnel to Dr. Sam, they are the greatest. I have been undergoing major work since March and I have been TOTALLY satisfied with their true spirit of compassion and their unwavering support and caring.  I have ONE final visit next week to complete my journey and am excited that I picked them to do what needed to be done. I've eaten nothing but soup since we started and can't wait for a homemade buffet next week.  I tell them each time I leave: Keep that smile on your face until the end of the day!!!  I have recommended them to EVERYONE!!!<//text>

EXCELLENT... Everyone there was very kind and mindful. It was our first time there and it had a really good vibe. And the dentist that extracted my daughter's two teeth, WAS AWESOME!!

The woman that made the appointment at the front desk, told me that I could come in at 11:30... but she mistakenly marked the appointment as 11 a.m., so she marked me as a no-show. I had to wait a lot longer to see the dentist, due to her error. The dentist was a bit of a jerk. I think she was trying to be funny with her comments to me, but I did not find them funny at all. In the end, I'm just happy to have finally been able to get that tooth removed ..because a litany of errors and miscues over a few years with dentist's offices,  made it a really long wait to be able to get that tooth extracted.</text>

Do not come here. This place does not feel covid safe.  There are many packed open air bays. You can hear the conversations in bay next door and it feels stuffy, like there is little to no airflow. Yes, they do take temperature at the door, but that feels more for show, than for safety.

The majority of the negative reviews are for the wait times. Which are rediculous. I was on time for my appointment and waited 40 minutes in the lobby. Then while in the chair, I waited an hour for the dentist.

Do not come hear expecting a personalized experience with your dentist. I spent less than a minute talking with my dentist about oral health. On my first appointment I was giving papers to sign and before I knew it I was getting a deep teeth cleaning. Nothing was explained to me. Felt borderline malpractice.

I recommend searching for a different dental group if you can help it.<//text>

I have to wonder if only new patients who haven’t paid in full get better treatment.

I complained last month...(09/2020)

If you have an appointment at 3pm is it fair to complain at 5pm? Why even bother to make an appointment? Would it be ok to them if I came in 2 hours late?

This month (10/2020)

Again, almost 2 hr wait, how is this acceptable? I paid $4,500 for what? His braces were supposed to be only 2 years, January 2021 will be 3 years. And still not even half way done. I would never recommend anyone come here for orthodontics. However, the front office dentistry seems more professional and shorter wait times. My son had an emergency, they seen him the same day and his wisdom tooth was pulled less than a week later.

When I complained the first time I asked the front office manager why it took so long. She replied, “We’re in a pandemic, be patient”. And then rolled her eyes. This time I complained the office manager I spoke to was kind and took the time to tell me that they know it is an issue and they’re working on it. I don’t know it that’s true or not but I appreciated her being decent towards me. So not all is bad, but I still would not recommend.

Thank you for your time in reading my long post.</text>

My PPO insurance covers the treatment at 80%! They told me my Insurance doesn't cover it. They even offer the credit card to cover my treatment.

I needed my wisdom teeth out so I was referred to this dental office. The whole place was clean and sanitized. The staff was very professional and kind. When I finally got in to see Dr. Peri there was a bit of the commotion because of another patient. Dr. Peri and the rest of the staff did an amazing job was handling the disgruntled patient and making me feel secure during the situation. The whole extraction process took only a few minutes. Dr. Peri made me feel very calm and talked me through the while process as he completed each step. Best experience at a dental office to date.< /text>

I've been to dentists on 4 continents and yet somehow this place is by far the worst I've been to.  There was a 90 minute wait to be seen before my cleaning, but once in the back the assistant told me cleanings weren't being done that day.  Finally, the dentist saw me and gave me an exam and he said I needed a deep cleaning (which they weren't offering until August).  I asked for a regular cleaning, but they refused.  They had a litany of other dental recommendations for me totaling over $5k -- and that's after the help of my pretty decent insurance coverage.  To top it all off, I researched and scheduled an appointment here to see a specific dentist at this clinic.  Initially, they told me he wasn't there that day, but an assistant told me later that he hadn't been at that clinic for several months.  I somehow spent three hours in the office and never even got a cleaning.

A few days later I went to a different dentist and they said a deep cleaning was not necessary and performed a regular cleaning.  They also didn't try to upsell and overcharge me for a variety of other procedures.

Avoid this place at all costs.  It really is the worst.</text>

<Review>Not a good experience. I was excited that they were able to make a same day appointment for me and that ended the excitement. Had a toothache that caused my cheek to swell. Came in for my 1pm appointment, finally had someone take me back at 2p to do x-rays. Was nice to see everyone wearing masks, but unfortunately the person doing my x-rays didn't understand that in order for the mask to be effective, that it should cover your nose. They do the x-ray, but after there was no dental seat available, so sent back out to wait till just a smidge after 3p. Bring me back again, take me to a seat, then I proceed to sit in a dental seat for 15 minutes until the dentist comes to work with me, which wouldn't had been so bad if maybe somebody spoke to me that it may be a moment rather than just sitting me in the chair then walking away. Dentist talks looks at my x-rays, looks in my mouth for almost 3 minutes, tells me his diagnosis and that I may need to see a specialist and that he will prescribe me antibiotics. While discussing this an assistant comes over and tells him something and he acknowledges me, telling me "just a moment." I am then left for the next 25 minutes. I finally approach one of the workers trying to find out what's going on. Another worker eventually comes back to me with forms to sign and my prescription. That's it. 1pm appointment there for 3.5 hours to get x-rays and speak with the dentist for less than 5 minutes. The frustrating part was the lack of communication and being left in the dentist chair for almost an hour, with only 5 minutes of total person interaction. Very poorly run. Front desk people were great though.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<Rate>1< /Rate><gmap_id>0x80c2c41049fbdc6d:0xb9893dfca6d872ed</gmap_id><review>Was given a 9am appointment, showed up on time, filled my paperwork ahead of time. Around 10am I told the receptionist I had waited an hour and she said I would be helped soon. A person waiting in  the office said this is normal and she has waited up to four hours for her appointments!! I also watched two people who came in at least 30 minutes after me get brought to the back.

About ten minutes later I told the receptionist I needed to go to work. She said they would get me in, they brought me in for X-rays, those took about 15 minutes, and then she asked if I wanted to reschedule my appointment for the check up or just wait. I asked how long it would be and she said 5 minutes. They sat me in one of the rooms and I waited another 30 minutes until 11am. No one came or seemed to be coming, so I left because no dental visit should take 2 hours and I had to get back to work. I understand things moving slower with extra precautions for COVID-19 but that should be accounted for in the way they make appointments. Why tell me someone to come at 9am if they wouldn’t be seen for over 2 hours?

The receptionist was kind and apologetic but it was obvious from her demeanor this is normal for them.<//review><resp>None<//resp></record></dataset><record>

Overall pleasant. I got Dr. Jonathan Peri‘s name from a list of oral surgeons from my health insurance provider HealthPlex. Of all the offices I called and they were quite a few of them from the list, his was the most responsive. Some didn’t even bother to call me back. A few had a problem of not listening and doing all the talking.

Not the case here. The only problem that I had with this office was the snafu of who should send the records and the referral slip that they wanted me to do it, and that should be the responsibility of both offices of the dentist referring and the surgeon’s. I’m the patient! I have enough problems with that as it is! I believe my dentist’s office eventually took care of it.

I’m a stickler for too many x-rays as they had to take additional x-rays at highland park. But these are a special kind that rotate around your head so eventually I didn’t mind. Overall Dr. Perry was fast and he had to remove not one as originally planned but two or three three molars in my mouth.

I highly recommend. If I need to go back to have any kind of oral surgery again moving forward, I definitely would be more inclined to come here and see Dr. Peri.</Text>

Our appointment was at 12 pm. We were asked to wait outside since the place was packed and we weren't called in to be seen until 2:30 pm. By the tike we got out of there is was 4 pm. Ridiculous wait times.  I've been trying to get fillings since way back in April and still haven't got them done because they haven't scheduled me an appointment. The one day I did have an appointment,  they left me sitting in the dentists chair for 2 hours until the office was about to close and finally told me they didn't have time to do the fillings and told me to reschedule. Horrible place!<//text>

We do ask patients to wait outside and in your car for social distancing reasons, to ensure everyone's safety. We also spend some time in between each patient's visit to properly clean and sanitize the entire room or area before allowing the next patient to come in.

Horrible place that over books appointments. Went in for a standard check up after a hour waiting I asked how much longer it would take only took a few hours off work and was told maybe another 45 mins. I called my insurance and got reassigned. Also want to say something is wrong every time you enter so they can make money. They tried calling to make things right but after dealing with this place for a few years I'm over it and they're overbooked appointment system.</Text>

<Review>Ive come here for a while. Sometimes it was fast sometimes i ahd to wait. Recently though it seems like im waiting 2 and a half hours past my appt time to be seen. Then more waiting for what needs to be done.

Today was the last time i will go here. I went in for a simple 6 month check up and cleaning.
I went in at 1 pm got seen at 240 pm for 5 secs by the dr. I had no cavities. Cool.
Said the cleaning will be done shortly.
At 320 pm i walked out and never got the cleaning.
I will not be back. I dont usually write reviews but this was too much. Even the elderly woman who had an appointment at 2 pm didnt get called till 320pm, at which time i was walking out the front door. Good luck to anyone else.<//Review>< pictures>

Every time I make an apt the wait time to be seen is from 45 minutes to even up to an hour or more. Made an apt this week for X-rays and cleaning but got sent home after the X- Rays “because they were gonna close already” my apt was at 4 wasn’t seen until 5:30.. after everything they blamed the receptionist and claimed she didn’t set up my apt for both even though they called and confirmed for both. The dentist and X-ray technician were really nice but it doesn’t make up for having to take time off work for a wasted afternoon.</Text>

<Review>A one hour wait JUST FOR XRAYS. They told me to come back for a second visit if I want an exam even though I had scheduled for fillings so they knew if need an exam but still only got xrays done. And guess what... I have to go back for a THIRD appointment if I want the fillings. Why on earth why not do it all in one visit? Especially during a pandemic they’re increasing our chances of exposure. Pretty ridiculous.< /Review>< Pics>

I had a horrible experience today.  I specifically asked for an appointment where both can be seen at the same time, but the reminder text gave me two separate times, 3:00 & 4:00 pm.  So, I had to rescheduled to an earlier time that they can accommodate, which was at 2:00 pm. I took time off work to take my kids to their new dentist.  Mind you, I did the registration online the night before and I still had to fill out a bunch of forms when I got there. We had waited for about an hour before one kid went in for x-rays, which took a long time, then was sent back out to the waiting area for another 20 mins, then was called to the dentist chair. After waiting 20 more mins in the chair, I went to look for someone to help.  As I walked around, all the other chairs were empty.  I thought they were super busy, that's why we waited so long, but no, I found out that they only had one dentist and he was already with a patient. So, by the time he would've gotten to my first kid, it would've been probably another 20-30 mins.  I found out the other dentist was out to lunch with the manager, so I couldn't even talk to her about what was happening.  I didn't expect this at all.  I would've liked them to have told us the situation and given us the option of waiting or rescheduling and not waste so much of our time.  We would've been there another 30 mins at least after working on both my kids.  So, we left.  Lost almost 3 hours of work and the kids lost time from homework.
UPDATE: I called the manager after and explained the situation. She was pretty understanding and willing to reschedule us for when she is around, so we wouldn't have to wait again, but, this whole experience has left a bad taste in my mouth. I didn't even express my experience from going there last Friday.
I waited a long time also, in the lobby and in the chair. The x-rays took a long time also. I did notice a bunch of workers walking around, like busy bodies, not like they stayed with the patient until  they were done, then move on to the next.  My cleaning was so minimal, like I've never had before. It was done within 10 mins, scraped between the teeth, then polished.  They said it's because of my recession, but come on, a cleaning takes longer than that.  I hope you have a better experience, but I don't think I'll be going back or my kids.<//text>

<text>I waited for an hour just to have X-rays done and I ended up walking out because I was so tired of waiting. I was in a ton of pain and I chose to walk out and endure the pain over waiting any longer. This place is awful... I went to the er and was in and out in the same amount of time I sat there waiting. Not worth it. I have a new appointment on Monday for a different dentist.</text>< Pics>

I entered into the office and at first things went well all the staff seemed nice. But then they continually attempt to sell you on different plans including one that i told them that I could not afford. I went back several times to deal with a decaying tooth to which I left each time needing more work. In review of some photos I took in their office of my x-rays.  They didn't even look to see the root tip which had abssed into the bone.  Causing my serious pain. As a veteran and human being I have never felt more disrespected in a dental office. Now I'm in the painful process of getting reimbursed for the cap I paid for on a promotion rate which they said they would have to "see if they could honor" even though I have never received the cap. Then when I call calmly because I wanted to check my status I was met with irritation and the receptionist was being rude even though I was maintaining my calm.<//Text>

I was a first-time patient at Dental Center of Highland Park and had a fantastic experience! This is one of the best dental offices that I have ever been too, extremely organized. A day before the appointment I got a text-message reminder that also gave the address, phone number, and option to complete paperwork online. The wait in the waiting room was typical of a medical clinic (probably about 20 minutes total). The staff is extremely friendly and compassionate. The exam was very thorough and professional. I had one cavity I needed corrected and there was absolutely no pain involved! Also, the clinic manager goes through all of the expected billing before any procedures are done, so there were no payment surprises at the end of my visit. Overall I highly recommend this dental office, and I will most definitely be a return client!< /Review>

Im scared, but that's my mouth! I will report back.

I had an appointment at 10am. I showed up at 9:45am and they didn't take my X-rays until around 10:20 and wasn't seen again until almost noon. I missed half a day of work, so by the time that i'm seen and they let me know that i needed a deep cleaning that was gonna cost me $125, I grabbed my bag and left. I probably would not have been opposed to paying that money if I was seen on time, or if they offered thorough explanations for the services and treatments they keep recommending. This was the second time I came to this place and was unsatisfied with the services. I will not  be returning again.< /text>

I'm still waiting to have my teeth cleaned. I've been here 2.5 hours. I wish I could say its Covid related, but the last time, pre-Covid I had to come back 3 times, just for a teeth cleaning. The office is inept, and I get the feeling they are trying to perform unnecessary procedures, stays, etc, to squeeze money out of the patients. It's also pretty filthy. This will be my last visit here or with West Coast Dental.< /text>

These guys are GREAT! They took care of my wife's pain in one day. She was afraid of visiting the dentist, but left their office feeling happy and secure. I visited soon after. They took x-rays and recognized every issue that needed to be addressed. I didn't have to wait long for my appointment either.

The people who work here are great. I've seen some of the patients coming in and out of there yelling, cussing at fellow family members, arguing about payments and insurance, etc. I don't see any of this as a reflection of the office workers or dental hygienists. In fact, they handle the "drama" pretty well.

Parking sucks, but it's Highland Park. What you gonna do.

Overall, this office is great. I'll report back after getting major work done.<//review>

<review>I called ahead of time in the morning for an emergency walk in and got told that I would be an emergency visitor since I did not have appointment. The waiting period to be seen took three hours and a half and everyone that had appointments got seen before I did. I was in pain throughout the whole time and the doctor did not want to see me, even though I explicitly said, that it was an emergency. The doctor replied “well he is someone else’s problem,” it was cruel and I did not get seen til two hours after.< /review>< user_id>

The dentist could not have been more professional and caring. Great staff I was treated with great respect .

I was going to be a new patient but after I was sitting there for close to 2 hours I ended up leaving because it was too risky in there with all the people in the waiting room.  I found another dentist who happens to be great.<//Text>

We had to wait an hour and ten min to even be called in to get an X-ray. This not the first time we have had an extended wait just to be seen. They over schedule every time. They don’t apologize or seem to realize it at the front desk. Then when we got in they jammed us through because we had waited so long but that meant they didn’t talk to us.< /text>

The service the nurse provide was excellent. Unfortunately all the time that I had to wait make me question  if this clinic would be the one for me. In fact I was about to leave. So for that I couldn't refer you. I’ll see how it goes in my next visit after that I will make my mind if I continue to use this clinic< /review>

Dental Center of Highland Park was okay! They ended up referring my son and I to another which then attempted to send us somewhere else! It took the staff an 1 1/2 to actually get the doctor to do the exam and the doctor came in for 2 seconds and left. As you can see, I was very upset with the experience I had.< /Text>

This place is the WORST they don't know how to manage their time whatsoever. They schedule too many appointments knowing they won't be able to take everyone, then they use the excuse that "unexpected things pop up". Seems like these unexpected things pop up all day long. I saw the staff falling asleep while on the clock. I was rescheduled 5 times in the past 3 weeks. Completely wasted my time, made me go in 2 times and wait an hour each time before making up lies for why i wouldn't be seen when the truth is they dont know what they are doing. Then they call me and tell me that I'm missing my appointments when they are the ones telling me they won't be able to take me the day of my appointment. After the 3rd time of rescheduling me for an 11am appointment they then call to tell me i need to go in at 7am (when they're not even open) then call me back and say oh no it has to be at 10am. You need new management and you need to retrain your staff so they can actually know what they are suppose to do.< /text>

So they took my husband in to the room, the specialist applied the anesthesia to work on him, little after that! Charlene, the girl in charge of insurance verification came to the room saying that he can’t be treated because the Dr is not in the network... they wanted my husband to go home already numb but with out any work done. It was unreal to wait 2 1/2 hours, have my husband numb and then tell him SORRY we can’t take you, you can go home.. we didn’t walk out right away, we called the insurance to verify and talked to the manager or the person in charge and they ended up taking my husband back in the room to do the job he needed to... my complaint is that they let the Dr. inject the anesthesia with out being 100% sure about the insurance approval.. So UNPROFESSIONAL! Not only that, she send my husband a txt saying, hope you enjoyed your visit.. was it necessary to make fun of the situation?</text>

If I could give zero stars I would. Horrible customer service. They don’t have appropriate equipment for children’s dental care. Waiting time was ridiculous, I had to wait 4 hours to then be told they could not do my children’s cleaning due to not having the appropriate equipment. Do not go here and save your time.</Text>

After purchasing a dental plan through Anthem Blue Cross I was directed here by my healthcare rep. As this was my first checkup in quite a while (1.5 years) and in a state where I'm a new resident to boot, I had my reservations. I don't make much and this dental option was one of the few I could afford.

Despite what other reviews claim, after arriving my information was processed quickly and within 15 minutes I was seen to. The preliminary X-ray service seemed a bit cursory, but after seeing the prints it's clear the staff were thorough.

After that I was moved to the dental chair for my proper checkup. I had a bit of a wait, but nothing to complain about. The office was calm, clean, and orderly. Several assistants swung by to chat. They were amicable and informative. After another ten minutes, I was seen by Dr. Lev.

Dr. Lev had the accent of an Eastern European and displayed a breadth of knowledge about his practice. He communicated, with total transparency, what my top concerns were as well as my treatment options. After brief discussion he left me in the hands of another assistant, who once more rehearsed what I wanted done and the price, insurance factored in.

With her guidance I was able to select treatments that needed to be taken care of (caps for a few cavities, gum sanitation) and sideline some of the more expensive treatments for the a later time, when I'll (hopefully) be in a more financially stable position. Her words : "I like to rehearse treatment options with clients at least twice so that, after we operate, they aren't blindsided by their final bill." After Dr. Lev, the honesty of her comment wasn't a surprise. Yet another reassurance that I was in good hands.

Carrying on, the operation (caps and gum sanitation) took about an hour and half of constant work. At no point did I worry about the quality of my treatment.

All in all, DCHP -- despite being secreted away in a tiny corner of a Fig Ave retail space -- was very professional and I'd recommend it highly.

To the staff : all the best. Us sore-tooth, bleeding-gum people are appreciative of your work.<//review>

I didn’t read the reviews until I was sitting in the waiting room. For 4 hours. Waiting. 4 hours.
And I had made an appointment a week in advance and I have dental insurance. Definitely wasn’t Beverly Hills. However, I did give them an incredible 4 stars and I’ll tell you why. The oral surgeon was badass. Chairs lined up 3 side by side, and this fool was pulling wisdom teeth like it was his joy in life. I had 3 difficult extractions done in a jiffy. Be patient if you can, the treatment was no nonsense and painless.< /text>

I initially choose this office because it’s so close to home.The staff is great on the dental side everyone is friendly and answers any questions you may have but you have to ask if not you’ll be completely in the dark. But on the Ortho side everyone with the exception of the Doctor have no chair side manner. The wait even with an appointment is killer! Every single time I have an appointment and this goes for me or anyone of my family members the wait to be seen with an appointment is oven an HOUR!!</text>

Then they told us we had to wait in the lobby some more time until a room opened up !!!! I told the front desk that i had Been waiting long enough my appt was at 3pm and I’m just getting seen at 4:10 . All she could say is “yeah i dont Know what to tell you ....” they finally get me in a room i wait Another 20 min. 3 different people come by telling me 3 different things my daughter needs . The dental assistant finally comes in to do her cleaning and asked me what my daughter needs .!? No communication whatsoever , by the time we got out it was another hour and 10 min later . Just wow ..< /review>

<review>Was excited to find a dentist within walking distance, but please DO NOT go here unless you absolutely cannot find another dentist. This was probably the worst dental experience I've ever had and it was only my first time there. Please take these negative reviews seriously.

I waited in the lobby for 1 hour, fine I thought they're a little backed up for the holidays. I was finally called in for an x-ray and then put out into the lobby again for another 20 minutes. I informed the receptionist I needed to get to work and was waiting for a while. She put me in a room where I waited a THIRD TIME for another 20 minutes. The dentist came in and explained some basic things to me and tried to upsell me on some gum retainers which I declined.

I was simply there for a check-up and cleaning. Then he left and I waited AGAIN for 15 minutes and was informed by the office manager I would have to pay $105 out of pocket for a cleaning???? My insurance covers cleaning so they were clearly trying to charge me more and I expressed my frustration that I've been waiting for 2 hours at that point just to get a simple check up. Then I waited again while the dentist and his assistant ran in and out (clearly he was taking care of several patients at once) and then they numbed my mouth and left me there with no explanation for 10 minutes?!!!! Why do you need a numbing for a cleaning, so ridiculous and I was left drooling all over myself for 10 minutes. He came back in and finished the work in 15 minutes and rushed out.

They need to fire whoever is doing their bookings, accepting this many people for the same time appointments with only one dentist on hand is irresponsible and greedy. It stresses your staff out because they're attending to too many people and rushing through procedures which could potentially cause mistakes.</review><user_id>113530192467432855685< /user_id>< user_name>

< Review>
I just came to the dental center to have a check up done after 6 years of neglecting my teeth. The dentist were very informative and took great care of me! Rosie the office manager had excellent bedside manor and worked with me my financial situation and insurance to offer me the best care possible. After checking out other dentists in the area this one made me feel the most welcome and comfortable.<//Review>

Worst Experience of my life. The staff from the receptionist to the dentist are the absolute worst! The front desk gives you false information. The billing lady is ridiculous at explaining my coverage. They try to charge you for everything even if your insurance covers it. The dental assistants are rude and inconsiderate towards patients. Do not go here. I brought up all my concerns to the office manager after being frustrated that a root canal   and crown took over 3 months to complete.I explained how horrible her staff were and how i was only speaking up because i seen how they mistreat patients who do not speak english. So if they are taking advantage of me i can only imagine how they are billing and treating patients who cant speak for themselves. She did nothing with the information i gave her. Ridiculous.</text>

I am happy with the service I receive for my family and I. Dr. Arthur is professional, friendly, provides excellent customer service and his confidence in what he does is comforting.

I did have a terrible experience with Dr. Sarah Goldstein who was completely opposite of what I mentioned about Dr. Arthur. Do not recommend her!!! Very unprofessional.

The staff are friendly, knowledgeable and I would recommend Dental Center of Highland Park.

A happy patient!<//Text>

Waited two hours before a dentist measured my gums and tried to sell me gum irrigation for $150, after I said no thanks they told me the hygienist was out and I wouldn’t be able to get my teeth cleaned.

Zero stars! Zero!!!! This place it the absolute worst I’ve come here multiple times because they would not do all of my work in one day. They did not tell me I was going to have to pay for the treatment until after they started. I have sat in the waiting room for up to two hours waiting to be brought to a room and then the appointment would take 5 minutes. They over book their appointments they never have time to see everyone. They’re always having to reschedule patents because of over booking and a lack of working dental chairs. I’ve sat in the waiting room for hours and have other people walk right in and be taken back which I do not understand. Not to mention every time you go there you will see a new doctor so don’t expect to build a relationship with the person who will potentially be drilling in your mouth. I’ve worked in the dental field before and at bug chain dental offices similar to this one and never have I seen an office so unorganized and ill managed. On an to top it off I received a text thanking me for coming to my appointment when I was STILL SITTING IN THE WAITING ROOM YET TO BE SEEN! Ridiculous! I will never step back into that office. And I hope no one else has to experience and Dental Center because I’m sure they are all like this not just the Highland Park location.</Text>

At consultation I received a call from my daughter stating i needed to pay an amount of  $1272.00, for procedure.  I asked to speak to the person who was quoting the following amount. Perla got on phone and stated she needed bone graphing @ $450 x2= $900 , plus$250 for nitro gas to relax her and additional  $176 for copayment. Which did not add up to amount she was giving me. I asked if they could hold off and contacted my insurance carrier and they stated that bone graphing is for implants and questioned why they needed bone graphing on wisdom teeth being extracted. And as far nitro gas that is not required. Local numbing is fine when performing procedure.  At this point I felt like this office was just trying to make money out of me. Perla was so persistent and kept cutting me off when was questioning procedure and cost.  Bottom line I had my daughter leave this office contacted office that referred me and told them they should not be referring patients to this office. They are not honest with with prices quoted to patients. People do your research before you agree to pay a penny. I have PPO insurance I cant imagine what they are charging others with HMO.

After scheduling another appointment elsewhere. I contacted office again for my daughter's panoramic xrays and was told I would have pay $25 to get them released. They have no use for them and my insurance covers cost, why do have to pay them for something that belongs to us.< /Review>< Pictures>

There are plenty of options for a dentist in Highland Park you should choose any but here. I have gave these people chance after chance to at the very least be professional not kind not courteous just professional!!!! They lied and wasted my time repeatedly. I look different then almost everyone that works there. The one person I see that is there hasn't been there as long as me and to me is just "a face". Today was the last chance!<//review>

BEWARE of this Dental Clinic (WEST COAST DENTAL-DENTAL CENTER OF HIGHLAND PARK).  MY WORST DENTAL EXPERIENCE EVER!  I went to this dental clinic for treatment of a tooth infection and their periodontist told me that she will treat the infection by doing root amputation, root canal and bone graft as what the treatment plan is of my other periodontist.  On the day of the surgery, she numbed me and then told me she will not do the agreed procedure but instead want to extract the tooth but ended up doing gum surgery instead.  At this point, they already collected $800 from me and collected total of $1,750.  After 2 months, the infection came back and I was told the periodontist is no longer with them.  I was promised another treatment but it took 11 months and no treatment was done.  The Manager gave me a run around until I suffered severe bone loss constant swelling and pain.  They said they are now giving the tooth a one year life span.  I was not told about this during the consultation.  They promised to put a partial since they just extracted the tooth which was not delivered as well.  When I asked for a medical records, they want to collect $250 whereas HIPAA law is to collect only photocopying and mailing.  When I reported to BBB, they were forced to give the medical records but it took them over one month to provide it.  I strongly disagree on some notes, their form has a line for patient signature but all the notes don't have my signature as they were not shown to me.   Take note that these records are NOT in the hands of third party, they have full control of these records.   For your protection, always demand that you sign all the notes and request a copy with both your signatures..  I paid money, lost the tooth, suffered pain and not got the item promised, how could this be right??? Let justice be served by God as He knows the truth.  What goes around comes around.< /text>

It's funny because they actually referred me to this place and I end up really feeling comfortable here. The staff are really nice, and like the comments below said Leo is great she is definitely wonderful at her job and I admire that. I got a root canal here and pain was so minimal for a root canal folks!!!. Awesome staff, and amazing work!!< /Review>< Time>

They overcharge you! I had my dental benefits pulled up on my phone and showing them that a general teeth cleaning has no co-pay and they still insisted on charging me a co-pay. I already knew this place tried to "up sell" you when you go on, so I was prepared with my benefits, but I didn't realize that they would REFUSE to give you your general teeth cleaning that your insurance has already paid for! They also insisted that they take x-rays every 6 months instead of the insurance mandated yearly x-rays. I over heard the guy next to me try to work out a payment plan for all of the up sales and over charges and now I feel sorry for him. I ended up walking out after sitting there, in the chair for TWO hours and not even getting a teeth cleaning. The billing lady kept showing me a BS insurance sheet with prices that did not match what I had pulled off of my plan site.<//review>

<Review>What I like about this dental office is that they are clean and they get me in and out.  They offer incentives for referring new patients and the staff are very friendly. I gave 3 stars because there's always a wait of about 45 minutes after my appointment time. Other than the wait, this office is great.< /Review><response>None</response>< userid>

Terrible company.  They made me an appointment to an office that was not even open! They didn’t call and tell me it was shut down, then they send me to another office and they didn’t treat me.  Stay away from these awful people.<//Review>

The wait time is always at least 30-45 minutes of sitting in the lobby which is why I cannot give them 5 stars.

Otherwise, I love this office. Staff is friendly, professional & knowledgeable.<//Text>

DO NOT BRING YOUR CHILD TO THIS OFFICE! I caution every parent to avoid this office at any cost. They don’t offer quality service or care about the patient’s needs. These people have severely damaged my sons teeth and jaw. I now have thousands of dollars worth of additional bills just to correct what their orthodontist did. Worst of all my child is left traumatized from the entire experience. I reported the problem to their main office, and they did NOTHING. We are still receiving calls from their billing department regarding money they’re “owed”. HORRIBLE HORRIBLE service.<//text>

My son needs to have a tooth pulled. We had a consultation on June 29th. We spent two hours there and were given an appointment on July 20th to have the work done. We got to the appointment early because of the long wait time. We sat there for 40 minutes before they told us the oral specialist wasn’t even in. They rescheduled his appointment for today. We were there for nearly four hours before we were seen. My son has Autism (which I made very clear when I scheduled the consult back in May) and has a difficult time waiting. He was already over it after waiting for an hour. By the time he was seen he was overly agitated. The oral surgeon numbed the tooth with the gel, two seconds later stuck a huge needle in his mouth, and needless to say, my son freaked out. He was crying and begging me to take him home. Then they told me he needs to see a Children’s oral surgeon, which is who is was supposed to have been seeing already, so to say I was furious would be an understatement. I will never go back to this place again, EVER!
And, on top of that, they had 35 patients in this small waiting area with one dentist and one oral surgeon working. Very bad work ethics. They should be ashamed of themselves!!!< /Review>

I wish there were zero star rating to use for this office. Where to begin.... poor scheduling practices, they overbook. Make you pay all upfront for braces (cash or credit card or opening a CreditCare card for you) and then make you wait up to 2 hours to be seen, have high turn over of orthodontists and dentists. We waited for 4 hours for our dental appointment. Just kept stalling from x-ray to examine, to cleaningC trying to upsell you.

Our family of 5 left this office and no longer see the dentist there. But unfortunately we had prepaid for my 2 teens braces and stick with rotten schedules and constant changes of orthodontists and schedules. Thankfully our third child is being seen by a professional dental and orthodontist and stayed away from giving Dental Center of Highland Park a single penny and not giving anymore time of ours. We learned.

Do yourself a favor and don’t go here. Time is money. You save a few bucks but lose your valuable time waiting and being lied to.< /Text>

This is the worst dentist ever. Do not go here. They are extremely rude. Everytime you go in there’s always a new manager, and new receptionist. That right there should tell you that somethings wrong if there’s new employees every month. The receptionist clearly have no dental experience. They will just book your appointment without telling you that you have to come back in a week or two. I live in another state and drove 5 hours to get my braces off for them to tell me I have to come back in 2 weeks. They were well aware of were I live and still did not tell me that I would have to come back. The receptionist knew exactly what I was coming to do and said nothing. I was called 3 times in one day to confirm my appointment and all 3 people failed to tell me it takes 2 visits to get your braces off. I live in another state, I can’t drive out here every other weekend. That should have been explained to me before my appointment was booked so I could’ve planned accordingly.<//text>

It is hard enough to take time off of work to visit the dentist as it is, but having me wait over an hour and 40 minutes past my appointment time just for the staff to take x rays made me want to change dentists immediately. I came in over a year ago to get a regular cleaning, and they told me i would have to wait 6 months for the deep cleaning since my insurance only covers the regular or deep cleaning and that my mouth would need something in the middle and that I would have to pay out of pocket, which I understand. They told me this 6 months ago, and today when I went in they told me I needed the same thing as the 6 months prior. Then they tried charging me $450 for the cleaning which is money I dont even have. Also the 6 months prior i met with a specialist who was trying to make me spend $500 to get my wisdom teeth removed without even telling me that I had the option to send in a picture of my x rays to my insurance to see if they would waive my cost. Your system is broken and your staff dont even want to be there. Every review I have seen online expresses similar complaints and Im just going to take their advice and switch dentists, because upon my third time visiting this facility, I've always waited over an hour and 30 minutes past my appointment just to be seen and told that Im not covered for what I need.</Review><time>1563838385744</time></record>

Bad service especially in the front desk.  The person attending me on the call was Yessica V, I've called to get a copy of my panoramic and they had said to show up to sign a release form and so it happened and they said it would have taken 3-5 days they never called me back what's so ever and I ended up returning the call back to see if it was ready..... they ended up giving me a copy of my xrays which I never had wanted because i clearly had said panoramic image on the release form. Furthermore, when I asked i wanted the panoramic she told me it was 35 dollars I said fine I'll be there tomorrow to pay for the panoramic I got there just to be told it was 85!? The ones working in the front desk should have a sense of good judgment and knowledge instead of giving false information. Waste of my time just driving over there!< /review>

My dad got his dentures replaced here, and he was very satisfied with them. The service was great and everybody was nice, especially Dr Robert. He was the most knowledgble and kind dentist my dad and I have ever seen. Waiting to be seen is quite long but totally normal and worth it. I seriously recommend this place.<//text>

I had a very very poor experience I had an appointment at 12:30 got there 30 minutes early and we still told that there were five people in front of me to see the surgeon they knew that upon me coming in for the appointment no one addressed it said anything and they just took the granite at me and the rest of the people that were there were just going to wait in the lobby until they came that was just very unprofessional<//Review>

I am so very disappointed with this dental office. I made an appointment for 3:00 pm on a Tuesday and waited an hour and a half before I was told I'd have to wait another 30 minutes to be seen. Then the receptionist tells me " oh, you never know what kind of day we will have here and today is just busy. Do you want to reschedule?"

This place is double booking customers for profit and obviously don't consider or value their clients time. They are taking advantage of those who have minimal options to go elsewhere. Beyond ridiculous and inappropriate.< /Review>

This is the worst place ever allll they do is waste your time and milk your insurance I took my son to remove a spacer and was told I needed to see a specialist...only to be told he needs an authorization but he was given instructions to be npo and be there first thing in the morning I didn't know a spacer was a special procedure.horrible patient assessment.im never going back!!!< /Review>

Especially the guy who's in charge of the orthodontist area. Instead of him helping me he said to me "oh pues", that's not a way to treat customer, and I dont mean it that im always right but regardless of the fact that's being disrespectful.  He put my appointment in their system at 4pm when I clearly told him I had it at 10am. They called me 3 times reconforming my appointment at 4pm and yet when I showed the day of my appointment they said it was at 4pm even when in the card they gave said 10am, they kept me waiting for more than 2 hours.

Overall I won't recommend this place no more, once I'm done with my treatment I just find some other place.<//text></record>

One of the absolute worst nightmare experiences of my entire life. My daughter needed treatment and all we got was rude, unprofessional service without a single smile. It's never a good sign when the first thing that happens between you and the dentist is an argument. Not a hello, a hi, a what can we do for you today, nothing. Just straight arguing about our need to even be there because we have a special needs child who needs a lot of gentle care when it comes to doing an X-ray, and we were referred to this place "Specifically" because they are supposed to be gentle and nice. However, we received none of that from these people. They were so mean that I walked out with my child and didn't look back. Do not come here. Ever. You will regret it.</review>

I wish I never went here to get my braces on. They make you pay every month and all they do every month is change your braces color. The receptionist give you attitude and don't help you at all. And the orthodontist assistants do everything fast. I recently had an appointment and all of a sudden my spacers are loose, and have to wait two months to get them glued back on. I DONT RECOMMEND!! I wish it wasn't to late to leave this ortho and switch.< /text>

Today it's really ridiculous, my kid had the appointment at 9:00AM, and we arrived there on time,  and we waited there 1 and half hour and didn't see the  doctor, When I first checked with them at 9:40AM, they said the doctor was not arrived, maybe 15 minutes would be ready,  I checked with them at 10:00AM, and I told them we were the first of the list, and waited for an hour, they said they will check and let us know ASAP. I really lose patient at 10:30AM to cancel this appointment,  I am going to enroll my kid to another dentist.<//review>

I only came because when I told my kids they needed to see the dentist soon, they called me out on being a hypocrite. The staff here was really friendly, professional and totally did not judge or make me any type of way for not having been sooner. The dentist was very reassuring and explained everything he was doing and kept making sure I was OK. They did not pressure me into more expensive treatments or push anything on me I didn't want/need. I will defiently come back and bring all my kids too. They've made long term cusotmers of us so long as they continue to treat us well!<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

So badly want to give this place a three stars! They provide Wi-Fi, free parking a block away, and TVs always on. Less expensive than competitors (although you should shop around, get a printout). The problem is a couple members give a bad vibe. Their male doctor bothers you after treatments to complain about your lack of brushing. He won't give you his name even when asked and gets treated with way more respect than you, the paying customer, do. When he gets fired, can I bring this up to a four. Another negative star is for the wait time: avg. 50 mins-over an hour after your appointment's scheduled. Happens multiple times, so be prepared to wait. Wi-Fi's free & works well. Restaurants are next door, brush your teeth w/ provided cute hygiene kit after. Ortho (incl. staff) is ONLY open on Mondays, so you MUST set appointments then, even the management. Magazines, wall-mounted video games provided, and most of the employees are kind. Need to treat customers better is the thing.</review>

<review>My experience at this place was not good. From the moment I walked in it was a bit sketchy. Front desk was girls were friendly that's about it. The entire time there I was uncomfortable and even tho I know there is a lot of work to be done in my teeth I felt like was being haggled by a sales man. At one point I had to telll the dr to be upfront with me and to be honest. They were trying to charge 600 dollars when I initially just went in for a simple check up. They said I would have to pay that before I left. Being part of the 99 percent I can not afford to drop 600 unexpectedly. All they kept saying oh but u need this and u need that and this is a really good deal and what not. I decided to only do the teeth cleaning because that was all I could afford to do. They said they had set me up in a treatment plan and had already referred me to the surgeon all before I even know all this was happening. My insurance didn't seem to matter to them. Another thing I would like to add is about the staff. As I mentioned front desk girls were friendly. The X-ray guy looked very unprofessional sagging his scrubs all over the place. The dr and assistant working on my mouth were having side coversations about personal lives. At one pint there were 3 people standing around me as they were gossiping. One of the tools that was being used seemed to be having malfunctions and they just wrapped tapped around it to hold everything in place. I will not be going back to this place. Management was dressed up for a clubbing night.
I feel bad for everyone who has had abed experience here and for those who have good ones you are lucky.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<Text>This dentist is the worst. They have the worst customer service imaginable. I went in for my first visit with my documents printed and filled out. I was excited to start working with them. #1 their hygienist is rude and condescending and does not explain anything about the procedures she recommends and stresses someone to get. #2 they take forever to come to you and let you know the insurance break down, I had to leave and was told I would receive a call by the end of the day of the next day. I did not receive a follow up call even 2 weeks later. Finally I give them a call and I am able to get a breakdown of procedures and prices. They suggest a crown and I let Leonela ( rude lady) know that my prior dentist suggested I do not get a crown if I am going to get braces. Leonela accuses me of self diagnosing myself. Leonela also states that if I wanted to be followed up with sooner I should have called her. I let her know it is not my job to do her follow up. I told her I wanted to speak with a manager because I did not appreciate how rude she is. She stated rosie v is her manager. Rosie calls me and half ass apologizes and makes excuses for leonela. Luckily I found a new dentist with less exaggerated pricing than this dentist and a million times better customer service. This Dentist is located in Eagle Rock near Vons in case anyone local to Highland Park wants a professional dentist with polite service and good follow up.<//Text></record>

<text>THE WORST!! They'll delay the time you have your braces off for about 6 months!! Also, most of the people are so rude and they're not careful. They delayed my braces for 5 months now, so far i still don't have it off. Their excuse were "we lost your mold" and "we didn't put the power band in" like what?! So unprofessional.< /text><Gmap_id>0x80c2c41049fbdc6d:0xb9893dfca6d872ed<//Gmap_id>< userid>

There is noting I like about this dentist they over price everything. Also even when you have a appointment don't expect to be called until 30 min later and then they have you wait in there another 30 min. They take forever to get you out if there and there are always switching dentist. It feels as if there only goal is to get more money in they don't care about there patents. I wouldn't recommend it not one bit.<//text>

Your sevice sucks...when your in pain and expect to see the dentist after waiting half an hour after your appointment time then to be told that the dentist can't take you because he's behind inpatients just because we are medical recipients doesn't mean we get to be treated like animals that really pissed me off when the guy came in and told me that the doctor wouldn't be able to do nothing for my root canal and I was in pain hope you improve your service Robin casepo< /Text>

<text>First, when I asked for a orthodontist appointment the receptionist told me that if I couldn’t come on that day then there wasn’t another appointment until May. When I said then I’ll look elsewhere she hung up on me. When I went in for referral/authorization I waited 45 minutes after my appointment time to be called up. Staff didn’t care about any of the patients or their time. I have switched dentist offices and will never be back there.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x80c2c41049fbdc6d:0xb9893dfca6d872ed</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

(Translated by Google) They take too long, my appointment was at 10:00 am. They have too many patients and that is why they take us long. It's 12:30 and I'm still waiting to get my teeth checked. They are not organized, there are patients who arrived after me and passed them on, I asked and the answer was that they are not new patients and that they are for other things.
You shouldn't make appointments for so many patients in one day.
One of the receptionists in her cell, made me ask her if they would call me, I had to repeat several times because she was not listening to me because I was on the cell phone.

At this point I better go out and find another place to go to the dentist

(Original)
Se tardan demaciado, mi cita fue a las 10:00 am.  Tienen demasiados pacientes y por eso mismo nos tardan. Son las 12:30 y todavía sigo esperando para pasar a que me revisen la dentadura. No están organizados hay pacientes que llegaron después que yo y los pasaron, pregunté y respuesta fue que ellos no son nuevos pasientes y que están para otras cosas.
No debería hacer citas para tantos pacientes en un día.
Una de las recepcionistas en su cell, me hacer que para preguntarle que si ya me llamarían, le tuve que repetir varias veces porque no me escuchaba por estar en el celular.

A este punto mejor me salgo y buscare otro lugar a donde ir al dentista< /Review>

<text>(Translated by Google) The doctors and the staff are very friendly. But they are very unpunctual if you have an appointment and you are doing well to say something will happen to you in an hour and a half by appointment. It's the only thing that is not good waiting for a long time and is that there are almost no staff enough working sorry.

(Original)
Los doctores y el personal muy amables. Pero son bien impuntuales si tienes cita y te va bien por decir algo te van a pasar en hora y media con cita. Es lo único que no es bueno la espera por largo tiempo y es que casi no hay personal suficiente laborando sorry.< /text>< Name>

Great experience getting tires here. They have the best pricing and service seems to be fantastic too. I purchased a new set of four tires and noticed a shake at highway speeds from 70-75mph, they rebalanced them no questions asked and fixed the issue. Definitely sending my friends here for tires!< /Review>

I cant say enough good things about tire guys. Im a nobody but every time i come in no matter how busy they are they always manage to make me feel like im the only one they are attending to. They make sure if another store has the tire i need they get it within the hour to put on my ride or if my tire needs repair im not leaving without my tire being road ready. When i buy new rims from them or not they always take care of my tire needs like if i did just buy the rims from them. If you wanna be taken well care of go to tire guys< /Text>

Great customer service. No questions too dumb or no jobs to small. I don't know if it was a former customer or friend that came by the shop while I was waiting for them to finish to work on my vehicle. But while he was talking to me he asked me excuse me for a second, walked outside to help a gentleman who pulled up and just needed some air for his tire. But then the man asked how much do I owe you and the store manager said don't worry about it bro it's free. That's great customer service to me. I live in Elk Grove but I will always drive to this location.<//text>

<Text>Great experience. Had sway bar links and rear brakes replaced on a 2010 Mercedes C300. Price was reasonable, as we got parts from the dealer cheaper than if I would have gone to them directly. Excellent customer service throughout the process; will be coming back for future tire and suspension work; definitely recommend these guys. One of the most convenient, high quality shops in town; their gallery on Florin and I-5 is really nice and upscale as well.</Text>< pics>

<Review>I came to get an alignment, because I drove onto a curb at 25 mph. They started out by telling me I needed new tires and brakes. I went with them with the tires, but the brakes were just replaced, within a year with ceramic pads and good rotors. I didn't go with the brakes, though they insisted. About 20 minutes after they replaced the tires, they said I was good to go. I asked about the alignment, and they said it was good. Never got a printout from them, and when I called them, they said they would email it to me. They got my email, but I never got it. I think I'll go to another place to get the alignment checked. Will do 4 stars if they got the alignment right, 2 stars if wrong.
Update: two days later, I went to USA Wheel & Tire across the intersection, they did the alignment, and found that it was bad. They fixed it and gave me a printout of before and after.
2 stars for the Tire Guys.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

<Review>Great shop for customized cars I have aftermarket rims and they are always careful to not scratch them. Their techs really take care of your car like it's their own. The owner Wasif is always helpful and always gets me the best price on new tires.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<Name>Edson So</Name>< Review>
Went in for an 2 wheel alignment and steering wheel was not centered and now it is really off. They claim it is because I need new tires, but I know for a fact it wouldn’t be this off. Never going back there.<//Review>

<resp>{'time': 1526152245628, 'text': 'After reviewing the notes on your invoice, it seems we advised you to replace all 4 tires with them measuring out at 2/32 seconds which are very unsafe to drive on. We hope you have gotten them replaced since you are a driver for LYFT and would want you and your passengers to feel and be safe. Thank you for your feedback, Tire Guys.'}<//resp><Time>1526104467049< /Time></record>

My milk tea was sweet and creamy with good tea flavor.  Soft, sweet, and chewy boba as well.  This location is rather small so it may get backed up if there's a line.</Text>

So sad. Just when I thought I'd found a new yummy boba place to frequent, it turns out the employees aren't really interested in more customers OR properly serving their current customers.

With each visit, Ive been told something different about drink quality and taste from the only two workers in the store, seems neither can get their story straight.

On a recent visit, the same cashier who isn't very friendly, nor does she or her co-worker listen, pay attention or explain very well, provided the same mediocre service as the last time I visited. What a disappointment and every reason to NOT return.

I've had better customer service, better quality boba drinks with much better affordable prices. To be honest, there is no reason a boba drink should be $5.50, unless its b/c the rent of their space is so high.

And because its not convenient to frequent Gong Cha, I'd prefer to not make an extra trip to a place that doesn't really care about their  service or quality of service they provide their customers. Especially when they dont try to make a customers bad experience better, and then have an attitude when any attempt is made or they put it back on the customer, as though its the customers fault they got their order wrong. There's no "You're business is important to us" Or, "We Care About our customers". Its obvious that they dont care, by their lack of service. Just another place in the bay that supports bullying.< /Text>

As a coffee drinker I have found nothing better than the "Milk Foam Milk Coffee - Panda style. Most pearl places don't carry anything similar. If you are not a coffee drinker  the yogurt smoothies Hit the spot Also.< /review>

By far one of the best sea salt foams in the city, lovely when drunk as a layer before the tea.

No food served in this location. Seating is minimal, inside and out.< /text>< rating>

I go here sometimes (maybe once a week) I order passion fruit green tea. It is superb, and a great refreshing drink to have on any day. It costs $4.00 for a medium, and $4.50 for a large.</Text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

One of the first Gong Cha in the area, and always with crazy lines. The Earl grey milk tea is good with boba, the line moves quickly, courteous service.
Free parking (crazy during weekends and holidays) credit accepted.< /Review>

<Review>Tried the Taro milk tea with 30% sweet 50% ice and white pearls. Pretty cool that you can change ratios. White pearls are weird and made out of seaweed. Crunchy texture!< /Review><Rating>4< /Rating><time>1426976045110<//time>< Response>

The line is ridiculous here - think 85 degrees (if you're a so cal head like me) in it's beginning days. The store is small, but it does have a few tables inside and more outside. There's a one-stall bathroom inside as well. They prompt you to think about your order in line so that it moves quicker, which helps, and have a barista walking around answering questions so you will really be set by the time you make it to the counter.

Since their milk foam was all the rage, I had to try it. It's the same idea as 85 degrees sea-salt coffee on an ice float. It's nice. It's also nice that they can personalize their drink sweetness and coldness. I had 70% sweetness and it was still a little too high for me and 100% coldness to make the drink actually cold. It was refreshing, but not something I wanted to line up for. In the state of milk tea madness, I think we can do better for a line-up worthy place, but I still enjoyed my tea.< /review>

< Review>
This place is one of my favourite milk tea places! Every time that I go get a drink from here I am never disappointed. My favourite drink would have to be the lychee oolong tea. I get 70% sweetness and 30 or 50% ice. I really like how you can choose the level of sweetness and ice you want in your drink. I've also gotten the brown sugar milk tea and ice cream black tea. They're so good! You can really taste the tea flavour in the drinks which I really like.

I went to Gong Cha recently and saw that they had white pearls that were made out of seaweed. My boyfriend ordered it with his Earl Grey and it was so good! The texture was really interesting; it was a little bit chewy, but it seemed like it was more crispy than chewy. Definitely try the white pearl!< /Review>

A tiny version of the Taiwanese chain tea shop with very challenging parking due to the rather aggressive drivers. I liked the regular milk tea as it did not have a powdery after-taste, and the green milk tea as it was perfectly steeped. The bubbles were perfectly cooked through, and the grass jelly was soft and light. Service was great, but the place can get crowded fast since it is so tiny.</text>

<Text>Came here because my sister said they had the best pearl milk tea in the area. Got the QQ passion fruit black tea (they let me substitute black tea for green tea) with less sugar and enjoyed it. I sort of wanted to ask them not to put in the coconut jelly, but was a little glad I ordered it as is, because I think it complimented the passion fruit flavor.

Long lines, but decently quick service.< /Text><Response>None<//Response><Name>Karen Wang</Name>< Date>

I've recently come to appreciate Gong Cha immensely because of their tea flavor. Their tea is strong and it really comes through. The couple of times I've been back, though the line is still long, the drinks have been consistent. I've been getting my boba at 25% sweetness and Gong Cha stands out being one of better boba places at balancing the tea and milk flavor without the sugar!</review>

Unbelievable long wait for an over-sweet milk tea. They're famous because they are the first one to bring milk foam tea into bay area but I feel they work too slow to serve the teas and, therefore, the super long wait.</review>

Solid milk tea, although nothing about it particularly stands out to me.

Tends to have a pretty long line, and parking in the area is always a huge pain because of the nearby Asian stores. Often easier to park elsewhere and walk over.< /text>

I've had the wintermelon milk foam tea and their black milk foam tea, and both have got me wanting to go back for more to have these teas again, and try the others. The next one up for me is the earl grey milk foam tea and I want to try their "white pearls."

There are long lines, but you can order in advance and just pick-up your order to go.

It's a good thing this place is far away from where I live and work, or else I'd be busting my food budget at this place.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x808fc643726b388b:0xee11416fc1f9c609< /Gmap_id></record>

<rate>4</rate><text>So apparently, what they're known for are their Mustache Foam series of milk teas (they offer 6 different flavors at this time, including a Coffee Milk Tea version), and so I went for the Large Milk Foam Earl Grey Milk Tea, 50% sugar and 50% ice ($3.75). (And if you must know, YES I made a milk mustache. Teehee!)

The authenticity of the tea was prevalent. The sweetness was at the right amount for me, and with 50% ice, it offered a good balance of coolness with a lesser chance of my drink being watered down. The ONLY thing that threw off the whole drink was that the milk foam was salty. What a weird curveball to throw into a milk tea drink. But overall, I still enjoyed it.

By the way, they offer sugar levels at intervals of 25%, and ice levels at intervals of 50%, which is much better than simply specifying "Oh, medium sugar and medium ice." since the ambiguity of the wording can be put up to various interpretations.

So to sum it up: I love this place, and I will be frequenting this place along with Ten Ren Tea much more often!< /text>< pictures>

The fist thing you will notice about Gong Cha is the line. It is usually pretty crazy here. There isn't much seating. They do a decent job of getting everyone through the ordering process relatively quickly. It is a pretty tasty cup of boba, but kinda overhyped and overcrowded.< /Review>

Sigh... I heard so many good things about Gong Cha prior to my visit here. The first time I came, I got a regular milk tea and was super disappointed! The second time, I tried the wintermelon tea and was super disappointed yet again. I probably won't come here again. But maybe thats just me, I have a friend who loves it - they get the milk foam w/ green tea. Maybe I should try that next as 3rd time is a charm?<//Text>

<Review>A solid, authentically Asian boba chain from overseas known for the "white boba" as well as the crema. A convenient stop alongside 680/880, they serve a variety of tea drinks that you can customize in terms of sweetness and toppings/additions.

I've tried the green milk tea and oolong milk tea with crema and white boba and both were good. The green milk tea is refreshing and the crema adds a nice sweet flavor and creamy texture. The white boba is apparently made from seaweed so it's healthier than normal tapioca, and is somewhat more aesthetically pleasing while mimicking the texture. It is a bit more gelatinous, but I couldn't really taste seaweed so I would get it again. The oolong has a nice roasted component that also pairs well with crema. Basically you can't go wrong with the crema addition here.< /Review>< Rate>

Customize your sugar quantity. Milk foam tea. Small place. Custom made = long lines.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) As soon as I went in, I smelled a sweaty smell. The matcha milk foam green tea smelled like mouthwash (face-covering).

一进去闻到一股汗馊味，那个matcha milk foam green tea味道很像漱口水(捂脸)。< /review>

I've been known to come to this group of people from there first location over on Highland & I continue to follow them now due to their vast variety of products, along with dope deals that come along with them as well. The bud tender *Ace* assisted me tonight & was nothing but professional.
He also had time to chime in on a trip that I was having to a song they were playing inside & that was deeply appreciated. Thank you again guys.< /review>

Came in for the fire buds and stayed for the excellent service! That guy ace in the was super cool! Tiffany showed me exactly what I was looking for and then some! I got an amazing deal on live resin carts and she showed me the best cbd for my back pain. I left that spot feeling  fully taken care of. If you haven’t been yet, quit sleeping!</Text>

Amazing stop love the flower hands down. Coming from Fullerton makes it all worth it as soon as you walk in. From the workers to the selection. Nails is so nice and makes sure I leave with everything I need without feeling rushed. Much love thanks for blessing the I.E with some actually good weed.</Text>

Wow!! Definitely coming back! I came in as a first time with my best friend and we both got hooked up!!! I got a 6g 8th of flower and she got the sweeter high edible deal. It was also their patient appreciation day so we grabbed some of the edibles and dirty sprite they have available for all the patients. New fave dispensary is San Bernardino. Im for sure bringing all my friends here!< /review>

<Review>This shop has the best Indica, I haven't had some like this in a whiiile! I happened to go in at happy hour and Sarah upgraded my eighth she also let me know about other happy hour deals that i did not know about ,  I couldn't recommend them more everyone and even the guard welcomed me and made me feel so comfortable! And I got a free fat dab as a gift the little dab bar was nice. I can definitely tell that they try to keep the place clean and i appreciate the hand sanitizer .They have lots of cartridges too, going in for Stiiizy's next. They had so many half and full grams also those potent stiiizy live resins! Love this place  🔥🔥🔥 ace is the best but Sarah is wayyyyt better ! Live the peeps here! ☺️<//Review>< pics>

This spot kills it every time I visit! They know all about their strains and the exclusive shelf if riddled with beautiful nugs from jar to jar! Hands down the only place worth going to in San Bernardino! Don’t waste your time at any of the shady shops around town. This is the best vibe in town! Ace was super helpful and the guy in the box was extra cool! This whole team is amazing and I always leave with a smile!</Text>

Hands down the only place worth going to in San Bernardino! Don’t waste your time at any of the shady shops around town. This is the best vibe in town! Ace was super helpful and the guy in the box was extra cool! This whole team is amazing and I always leave with a smile!</Review></record></dataset><record>

I love this shop and the deals. They have great ideas and great products. I love the cart selection they hav and they offer different shells of flower which is great because I can use super strong flower so so them offering lower shelfs is great. I recommend this shop 10/1<//Text>

This place is amazing! I come all the way from Riverside to stop by here. I’m not really one to drive a distance for anything, but Treez has some of the best deals and product that I’ve seen available in a while! Their selection of flower is unmatched and they have multiple tears of pricing to support it! I picked up an eighth recently and SHOUT OUT TO NAILZ for truly helping me pick my new favorite strain 😻 she was so polite and genuinely concerned with finding me a strain that would suit my needs and be happy with. Her knowledge against the effects of each specific strain was very helpful in narrowing down the perfect option for me!! I really enjoyed and appreciate the time she spent with me as it made my overall visit and experience that much more pleasant 🙂 can’t wait to head back!<//text>

My first experience with a cannabis dispensary and it honestly was such an experience the first time going in. Me and my girlfriend tried their prerolls, flower, and edibles. All three worked like a charm. Not to mention all the deals they have, and the free rewards system they have. I definitely recommend this dispensary if you’re in the area.</text>

<text>The best dispensary in San Bernardino!! They have great happy hour deals on flower! Not to mention they have a new happy hour at 11pm-midnight and they do buy one get one on the C-21 now!! Love how they are always stocked with different Stiiizy cartridges as well. Outside is a little rough but the inside is SO nice and the guards make me feel so safe & bud tenders are always welcoming!

This is the best spot in and around San Bernardino! The staff is so friendly! The guy in the box was amazing! Galaxy was so much help! Their Private Reserve is the best I’ve seen around!

<text>I wish I would of found them sooner!!! Everyone there is extremely friendly especially Axel! He always hooks it up, he's AWESOME! Super love him! He's always explaining the new products that are constantly coming in and informs me of the new deals they're having. The Stiiizy and Lemon Tree live resin sugar products are fire!!! You have to go and try them! I'm also a huge fan of the CBD products they have as well! & They stay open late which a huge bonus, cant beat that! I'm literally never going anywhere else now that I found this place. Thank you for always making me feel welcome and giving me such a great experience each and everytime!💕</text>< pics>

<Review>Place was dope Nailz  know wassup with her bud. I came in just to buy weed and was curious about the wax and oils they had. She made sure to hook me up with a new steezy set for the low and was still telling me about the deals they had going on in the bud area. I’d recommend this place to anybody and I’m forsure coming back for that premium product and service thank you Treez for opening in my community. This spot a 5 star</Review>< Pictures>
