I got the number 1, which is a large beef soup with beef balls, soft tendons, rare beef that is cooking in the boiling hot broth with rice noodles. The place is pretty big and can pretty much sit where you want. The broth was delicious and flavorful. The employees here were nice, didn't really talk much, but I'm ok with that. I had a Thai tea to go with my drink it was yummy. I would go again.< /text>

<text>I haven't been here in so long... the last time was with my dad (God rest his soul). This spot was my dad's favorite spot. I went here recently with my wife to share with her how much I love this spot. Skeptically she came with me. After a delightful lunch where I got the rice noodle Pho special and my wife got the regular pho special inclusive of fried egg rolls and a boba drink for my wife, she became a believer and enjoyed her meal. This spot has been here for a long time and it brought back a lot of good memories. The food is still really delicious and hits the spot. You won't be disappointed. I took a few pix... sorry, though... I munched on two of the fried egg rolls quick before I was able to take a pic.<//text><GmapID>0x808f7bd34da79cf1:0x53614f977a220c46< /GmapID><name>Garry Consolacion</name><user>113897761544249770696<//user>< pics>

Quick and fast service. Big portions.  Dont expect service like a fancy restaurant.  I really like this place when I want some pho  or rice plate on a cold or chilly day.< /text>

We ordered Pho and it was okay. Service was okay. They remembered the specifications for our order. It wasn't that clean, but it was okay. Overall, it was okay/decent. But the price did match the quality, so for what we paid, we got quality that matches that.</text>

Fast service. Great tasting food. They have to relocate due to covid. I'll follow them to wherever they reopen. I always get the number 12 pho, steak and brisket, and the 49, fried pork chops.<//Text>

The first visit was not good.  However the boss fixed the problem and it improved a lot.

Waited for a long time at the table.  Asked three people to help order.  Only one acknowledged me.  Third person pointed to another person who ignored me to put napkins into the holders.  Sunday mornings may be an off time however I gave up and left.

I went back again because I thought I would give it another chance and the food was excellent and the staff was attentive. At this price point it is a good deal and they were friendly.< /Text>

Compared to the one @Westlake this location has:
1. Lots of parking, not busy
2. Not very busy inside, so less noise
3. Decently priced if not cheaper than Westlake

I'd go here even though it's farther away to me than Westlake.< /Review>

<Text>Good tasty food! I think in comparison to other pho places the portions are a little smaller for the same price, that's why I rated it 4 stars. However they were polite and quick to bring out all our food and it was delicious.<//Text>< response>

Go to place for vietnamese in the area. The food is fast, consistent and I have only once ever had encountered even the slightest mistake. I can see why the local tours in the area make this place a stop! Keep up the good work.</review>

<text>I'm not sure why the low rating. I give it a 4-star easily, because they are quick, inexpensive, and for what they serve they are very good. Their noodle soups are great( I like their seafood combination), and their bbq pork is also good. Oh, and let's not forget their inexpensive fresh spring rolls.< /text>< userid>

< Review>
Pho the Gioi Inc. is not my go-to pho restaurant, but the service is quick, food portions are decent and there is no minimum payment for debit card/credit card.

Their various broths are OK. I've had better. I have to season my pho to the fullest in order for it not to be bland.

There is a parking lot, so that's a plus. Wait time is short ~5 minutes or less. Servers are accommodating to small or large groups.<//Review>

Waiter unassuming but gets your order correct.  Usually i order take out but had time to enjoy a table on the sunny side.  Ordered bun with bbq chicken and pork.  If you eat inside, they include cup of pho broth. Yum. Fried chicken wings are huge!</Review>

This little pho shop is nestled up higher in the mountains and is hidden from people who just stay close to the main streets. The first thing that I noticed is that all of the beef was higher quality than other places I've tried. The texture of the meatballs was smoother and more consistent. The noodles were more chewy. The broth was flavorful, and I only added a little bit of sauce to introduce spiciness and tanginess. The beansprouts and basil were very fresh. I ate there in the later evening hours of a weekday, around 8pm, and the atmosphere was clean and relatively quiet, and the staff was very attentive and the food arrived within minutes of ordering. The price is also a bit more affordable.< /text>

I like their food but service can be a slow. Portion sizes are inconsistent. They didn't give us drinks until after we started eating and we've sat there for about 30 min.</Review>

<text>My best place to go. Waiter already know our order. When they see us coming give us tea and chopsticks rightaway and then ask # 1 and # 55. All we had to say is yes sir pangyaw( friend). We enjoy every food we order. We bring our family friends there for pho. Try it. You'll enjoy slurping your soup.</text>< pictures>

<review>The pho was average, spring rolls were fine, the vermicelli was shockingly bad. The noodles were barely cooked. When you lift it up, it was sticking out in all directs because they were so hard. Probably won't be returning. Service was ok. Nothing special about this place.< /review><Resp>None<//Resp>< Pics>

This place is HORRIBLE! When the ppl gave my mom her food they splashed it all over my sweater and the noodles were dry and hard. Most of the food here was dry and hard. And the service was also horrible. When we tried to order it was like they couldn't hear us. The ppl that served us were rude and stupid.</Text>

Some of the yummy-est Pho in the world! Clean. No, REALLY! Clean! dang this is the cleanest Pho evar, I could prolly eat off the table or the floor. Good drinks. Tea is like tea, not lightly tea-colored water. Great supplies of basil, sprouts, cilantro, etc. for your stuff. I get rare steak and beef balls with spring rolls. Ah sooo goooodd! Coconut juice isn't authentic but it's good. (I love a good coconut juicy. but that's another story!) Thai iced tea is good. Price is good. It's all good. I have gone here many times and will keep coming back again and again.</text>

A literal 1 star pho place. Maybe 2 stars on a really really really good day. I have tried it twice just in case, just to make sure, but it remains a 1 star pho place and there is no hope for it.

Broth is a mix of beef-grease and MSG.
Meat is barely recognizable hacked brown lumps.
Noodles are barely cooked.

Interior is basically the same as any hole in the wall pho place, but I have reviewed probably about a hundred by now. Every single one was better. Pho the Gioi is the worst pho I have had from anywhere at any time.

It is actually better to get any JML soup, or a box of pho stock and some top ramen and just scissor cut some beef yourself-- than to eat this. If you're looking for good pho in the absolute closest area, your only option is Ben Tre for like 3 or 4 star pho. Your other option is Pho Saigon for other 1 or 2 star pho, slightly better than Pho the Gioi.< /Text>

Food is consistent and portions are adequate, but avoid sitting near hallway to restrooms where there is always a lingering funk of disinfectant and toilet odors.  And avoid sitting next to the entrance when in certain months the South City wind can chill you and your pho to the bone.</text>

Pho was not very good. Noodles were not very good (thick and gelatinous) and the broth was really oily. Ordered vietnamese coffee and never received it, even though they tried to charge me. Wouldn't eat here again.</text>

< Review>
Their Pho hits the spot when I'm in need. Every once and a while I have a serious craving for Pho and this is usually where I decide to spend my money.</Review>

(Translated by Google) This shop is economical and has been open for many years. I ordered a beef noodle. The beef is too old and the wood can't bite. This was not the case before.

<response>None<//response><Review>Today was my first day ever coming to Nelly’s and i was very scared at first due to a bad experience i had in the past in another hair salon and also because i am way too picky with my hair, but the ladies here were super nice and listened well to what i was asking for.They have a really good service and they are professional, I loved the way my haircut turned out. If y’all are in search of a good place to get haircuts and at a really good price i really recommend this place, its honestly the best beauty salon I’ve ever been to. 💇🏻‍♀️<//Review>< pictures>

A welcomed change of price and quality when compared to other chain type haircut businesses in the area. While certain chain establishments offer decent-at-best cuts at $12, $15, or $20+, Nelly's normally charges $8 for a QUALITY basic men's cut.
Very friendly and experienced staff

PROS: Pricepoint, location, solid staff
Cons: sometimes long waits, location caters mainly to Hispanic community, cash only, no ATM on site<//review>

I went to this is salon thinking they knew what they were doing and it was my first coming here , I trusted them to do my eyebrows (and I don’t really trust people with them but one salon) as they were doing my eyebrows I was sure they were doing a good job . But once I saw my eyebrows , they looked like they didn’t even take off hairs ! I just wasted money for  no reason . So disappointed . Plus the lady was breathing on me  .<//Text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Bad experience today with my court. The lady did not know very well how to cut my hair and asked another worker for help to cut my upper hair with scissors. And then he asked another for help to unbalance my sideburns. So my haircut was done by three workers I felt like I was in a haircut school where they catch you from practice. Nothing professional the place.

(Original)
Mala experiencia hoy con mi corte . La senora no sabia muy bien cortar el pelo y le pidio ayuda a otra trabajadora para que me cortara el pelo de arriba con tijera. Y despues le pidio ayuda a otra para desbanecer mis patillas. Asi que mi corte fue hecho por tres trabajadoras me senti como si estubiera en una escuela de corte de pelo donde te agarran de practica. Nada profecional el lugar.<//Text>< Pics>

Great service! I needed a plumber ASAP, as one of my pipes developed a pinhole leak and was flooding my garage. McKeown Plumbing came to the rescue! The technician did a great job fixing the pipe, he was clean and very nice. I'm happy with the results and can recommend McKeown Plumbing with genuine confidence!</text>

Our sewer nine backed up - I called McKeown on a Saturday, Halloween, at about 10:30 AM. They had someone at my house in less than a hour.
The job was completed in less than an hour.
The plumbers they sent were polite and knowledgeable.
The bill was very reasonable for a rush job on a weekend.
They did a great job<//review>

McKeowan went above and beyond to find a part for our bathtub - it's an old house and we are so happy we didn't have to tear out walls and start over.   Miguel, our technician is terrific.  Great company with professional people.  Thank you!</Text>

Juan Carlos was very helpful and knowledgeable. His diagnosis made sense in that he thought the roots in our landscape drain were from a palm. We had planted a palm 5 years ago on the other side of the building. We will remove it and have Juan Carlos come back to check root growth after winter rains. Thanks so much.</text>

They were couteous and completed the work.  When the new disposal stopped working, they came back and showed me the problem without charge.  The problem was a switch that had been turned off and nothing they did wrong.< /text>

Had a "gas leak' issue with an appliance. The tech showed up on time,diagnosed the problem, and recommended a valve/line replacement. Problem solved and the tech was in possession of the replacement parts. I am sure the tech thought the problem was simple  but I appreciated his expertise. Thanx McKeown</Text>

<Review>I have used McKeown Plumbing for 8 years and they have done several jobs for me with the utmost professionalism and on time service.  I just had a slab leak and after 1 week of Service Master cleaning up the leak mess, McKeown came out and did a full reroute of the cold water line.  They completed the work faster and 20% under the estimate the insurance company gave me.  I have had a great experience with them not just once or twice or three times but at least 6 or 7 times over the last 8 years.  Very happy, 6 Stars !!<//Review>< pics>

I had a gas leak and Juan Carlos and David did a bang up job repairing an entire line.  It was very complicated and they had to work in a very narrow cramped space. It turned out to be much worse that what I first thought.  My whole house could have blown up!  Thank you McKeown, my new go to plumbers.</review>

Not so fast 45 years in business!  You are not being honest!  You can add that to my review, too!! Your service man did start the job!!

However, it is important to note that not a single plumbing service of any kind or type was performed at this property.  Rating us as incompetent or excellent for that matter is just not possible and not reasonable in our opinion.'}</response>< user_id>

I recently had a main sewer line in need of repair. I called a plumber who I had been using for years in Laguna their name starts with a (A) for those of you who are local, and it was a nightmare getting them to even come out. As a matter of fact they called back 15 minutes before their scheduled appointment and hung up saying it was too late in the day to come!! This mind you was a emergency call. McKeown came out the same day fixed the problem which was a huge repair. They were prompt, professional, and the job was done in no time, at a very fair cost!! 10 STARS!! I will only call them from this point on. And I won't write a negative review on the (A) company but very disappointed in them. Already called McKeown today for another job!! Customer service is key these days!!< /review>

After seeing the 1 star post, I had to give my opinion. I have used McKeown Plumbing a few times over the years and they have always gone above and beyond to do the job right and make it right. Their pricing has been fair and their work excellent. I would not hesitate to recommend them to anyone in the Laguna Beach area.< /review>

This company is TERRIBLE!!!  I asked them to come run a water line from the kitchen sink to the other side of the kitchen for our new Keurig which is only about 10ft (it is a small apartment in Laguna Beach).  The Keurig needed a part to it which they offered to order for us, we paid them almost $300 and have been waiting for them to come back with the part they ordered.  It is has been almost 3 weeks and I've called and text them several times trying to see when the part is coming in and when they would be back to finish the work they started that we already paid for.  Within the 3 weeks, they answered ONE time saying the part should be arriving this week and they will be here to install it.  It's been a week since, I've placed numerous follow up calls but no has answered.  Over the course of 3 weeks, I've tried to reach out to this company and no one answers their phone, no one returns calls, and they have charged us the $300 for unfinished work.  DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!!<//Text>

{'time': 1450749630450, 'text': 'Hi Jen, sorry you feel this way or for any inconvenience.  We try hard to make our customers happy.  The $285.00 was for the copper water line run and an angle stop, which was completed.  In speaking with the guys, we were going to try and locate the part for your Keurig and install it as courtesy.  If you feel like you need some sort of reimbursement, then we would be happy to discuss that with you.  Sorry for any miscommunication or if we lost track of finding the part.  Again, we try our best to help everyone and be a fair and honest company.  Happy holidays.\n\nJon\nOwner'}< /Resp>

<date>1583411806369<//date><text>New favorite LA bar. Burgundy Room felt like a Chicago bar to me and I mean that in the best way. Always so happy when I find chill spots like this in LA where there is always a need for more chill. Simple red light decor, a variety of odd characters, loud music, strong drinks. Perfect.< /text>< Gmap_id>

It was ok. Bartenders are nice but not enough of them. Tiny bar but it must get busy because there was security. A bit pricey.< /text>

The food is good, the beer is reasonably priced. I always get served quickly! The only downside is there is no smoking on Grand ave; you have to go around the corner.<//text>

<Text>I had a fantastic experience dealing with Troy at Corvette Mikes.  I purchased a car sight-unseen.  It was 50+ years old,  original, unrestored.  The car arrived and is EXACTLY as described.  In a trade that's dominated by sharks & half truths Troy is a stand out person to deal with.  Exemplary service. Highly recommended.</Text><userid>105172551479450285704< /userid><Resp>{'time': 1614959356508, 'text': 'Thank you for trusting us in the purchase of your Classic Corvette.

Owner of C6 Z06.  Recently discovered oil leak bottom of the engine on the vehicle and recommended by fellow ‘Vette owner to give Corvette Mike a call.  Scott from service dept. was very knowledgeable and diligent about follow up after the drop off.  Located in very convenient spot in OC.  Friendly staff and beautiful showroom.  This might just become one of my favorite spot to visit in the future.</review>

I'm in Arizona and the transaction from California could not have been handled better.  After the car arrived I found some things that I thought needed attention ... Corvette Mikes was not required to help me on this but they were extremely interested in listening to me and they stepped up and helped me get this done.

I would feel comfortable buying from them again.  It's refreshing to be treated well.

<review>Just purchased a Porsche from out in Florida that is being shipped to me now, want to purchase a Corvette to place in the collection but when I got to this company’s web site it tells me I’m locked out. What kind of business sells a product but locks their customers out of their web site?  Oh well, literally thousands of vets for sale on unlocked web sites.< /review>< pictures>

Brought my 69 Camaro here many times to do thousands of dollars of business 2012-2013.  They were very nice and knowledgeable.  So not sure why this happened.  I brought two carbs in, one was the original two barrel which was installed in the car and other was a four barrel Holley.  I was contemplating which to put in.  The head guy there said it was a coincidence that there was a Holley there that another customer brought in that was identical to mine but was leaking from everywhere a carb could leak.  After discussing the carbs with him I decided to leave the two barrel on the car.  He asked if I was sure and did I think I would ever use the Holley and I thought it odd he asked me a few times and also right before I left.  I said I would not, my mind was made up, I picked up the car and the Holley was put in its original box.  Well after a couple weeks I decided to try the Holley again.  I installed it and the car would not start.  I thought it was weird and kept trying to turn it over.  Finally I went to the carb and there was fuel all over the top of the engine.  I realized then the reason why he had confirmed with me more than once that I had not planned to use the carb, it was because they switched the leaky one with mine after I assured him I was not going to use it.

Be very careful if you bring parts in there.  Mark them in some way and take a pic.   I’ve never been back and I’m kind of sad as I thought there was a kind of friendship.

This incident happened in 2013 and it’s bugged me for a long time.  I just had given the shop a one star rating with no explanation.  Finally decided an explanation is needed.  I hope the guy is still there and reads this and remembers.  I wasn’t angry at the time nor now I’m just disappointed and sad at the situation.  At least he’ll know I was aware of what happened.< /Text>

<review>Corvette Mike’s is top notch for Corvette service and restoration needs.  I spent more than 25 years maintaining my C-3 Corvette and was hesitant to turn it over to someone that didn’t appreciate what has become my “classic”.  In 2004 I first met this tight group of specialists who understand the cars and valued my concern for detail.  My car is no longer a daily driver but I still love to drive it when the time calls.

Like all ’69 coupes mine had issues with a leaky and temperamental AC, a troublesome ventilation system and engine cooling that sometimes gives under the heat of the summer.  It was time for conversion to R134a and Carl found the right mix of rebuilt and replacement parts to maintain the authenticity and OEM look.

They rebuilt the compressor and made it look factory fresh, provided a POA valve that maintained the original appearance and installed a new aluminum radiator.  Finally the car provides reliable cold air and can idle in hot weather traffic without worries of overheating.

The power windows were also serviced. A series of minor parts replacement, parts cleanup, rebuilt motors and new window seals has the system working better than when I bought it.

Professional and “car service” don’t always go together but they do at Mike Vietro’s.  They know restoration and repair.  Thanks again for professional grade work.< /review>< resp>

<Text>This place contains experts for the repair and maintenance of Corvettes. I have been going there for years. They are professional, knowledgeable, dependable and honest. They have a loaner available and are great about appointments. They sell Corvettes also. If you want or own a Corvette, you would do well to do business with these guys.  2 thumbs up.<//Text><name>Bruce Franklin< /name></record>

<Review>Recently, I made a service appointment for Wednesday, April 24th at 8am.  I drove my 1996 Corvette to Corvette Mike’s and met with Carl, who I requested to replace my spark plugs if they were factory (old) and inspect the spark plug cables.  I left and walked over to a Starbuck’s to wait for a call regarding my car, and received a call less than 90 minutes later.  Carl informed me that my plugs were not factory and had been changed to a platinum type plug and that all was fine with the car.  I asked him what I owed for the spark plug inspection and he told me it was free of charge!  I was quite surprised that a specialty automotive repair/maintenance/restoration shop would not charge for this diagnostic service.  I want to thank Corvette Mike’s and especially Carl Pugh for this professional, friendly, and honest experience.  I’ll definitely return for any maintenance and repairs for my Corvette that I can’t easily perform myself!

<Text>I contacted Corvette Mike's as another specialty corvette shop decided that they didn't have the time to repair my supercharged C6 after I had already trucked it over to them. Carl and Scott from corvette Mike's were extremely helpful and knowledgeable and went through my car with a fine toothed comb to isolate and advise on any issues that would affect the performance and safety of my car. I live over 100 miles away and still would never get my car worked on anywhere else. Thank you Corvette Mike!< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< UserId.>

My mechanic for many years recommended this place when I needed a new gas tank for my 1973 Corvette and I'm sure glad he did.   They were professional, fairly priced and fun to work with  Let's face it operating and maintaining a vintage Corvette will never be cheap but hey it's a labor of love and Corvette Mike understands.  Thanks Chad and Neida for a great experience and my mechanic, Kevin, for a great recommendation.<//text>

I want to thank all the people at Corvette Mikes for the fantastic work they are doing on my 62 "project" car. I brought it in as intending to do a quick "just get it running and on the road" but the work Scott is doing is putting it well past the beater status it might of wound up as. This car is definitely going to be something any vette owner would be proud of. I cant wait to get it done  and show it off!!! I have more projects for you Scott!!!<//Text>

I have owned my 1971 Corvette  for forty three (43) years. The last six (6) years I have been working on restoring the car. Do to a car running a red light causing an accident. I need to replace the thirty four ( 34) year old paint job. It was recommended by several friends to do all of the remaining mechanical repairs to the car before the new paint is applied. The car was taken to Corvette Mike's to restore the car. What Chad at Corvette Mike's discovered was all of the previous repairs done to the car was either not done and or done incorrectly. I'm now having more work done because of the incompetent vendors that did the prior repairs. All the work Chad has done has been excellent and he has pointed out all the work he has done to the car.  Plus he pointed out what additional repairs need to be done. As an owner of a car from the seventies you forget that these cars weren't designed to go over a hundred thousand miles. Therefore at the age of my car more of the car needs to be restored for no other reason than for safety. I didn't realize how unsafe the car was until now. Chad has not only done an outstanding job on the repairs but Corvette Mike has sources for parts that are the best available in the market place. If you want to repair and or restore your Corvette go to Chad at Corvette Mike first to make sure the work is done correctly the first time. Don't make the mistake I made and pay twice for the same work.</text>

I use to bring my car to mike's in the 70s and 80s when I lived on O.C.

and was always happy with the results.  Since I moved away I have been using local corvette shops and have not been pleased with the results.  I have finally given up looking for another reliable vet shop and decided to just make the trek to O..C.  and let mike's do it right the first time. Scott was very helpful, and kept me informed about progress and issues, and the car was finished in a very reasonable amount of time. (unlike other places I've used).<//Text>

<review>I recently purchased a 55 T-Bird from Corvette Mike. It is he only car I have ever bought without viewing it - being some 5500 miles away in the UK this wasn't a viable proposition. Having made initial contact with Troy via e-mail, after several telephone conversations, more e-mails and perusal of plenty of photographs a deal was struck, money transferred and shipping arranged. A short time later I received an e-mail from Troy saying that they had found a problem with the gear selector and that shipping would be delayed until they had received the parts to repair it. How long was this going to take? Was this a ploy to renege on the deal ? Had they had a better offer? I needn't have worried, a week later I received an e-mail from Troy saying that the repairs had been completed and that the shippers had been informed.
When the car arrived it was far better than I had expected, looking good, absolutely solid and on the button. It needs a new soft top - which I knew about, a change of fluids, and good to go.
Thanks guys, when I get the funds together for a C1 Corvette I will be in touch.< /review><date>1423393347886</date><gmap_id>0x80dcd6c97cb4d49f:0x3a19ce45168f32ed<//gmap_id><Name>Jim Dodd< /Name>< rate>

I recently bought a 07 Indy pace car from mikes corvettes in California. California???? I live in Pennsylvania. WOW. I bought this car sight unseen. The car was exactly how it was advertized. My salesmen troy described the car exactly as it was in pictures and video. Jeff and nieda did an awesome job in getting my title to me quickly. They also took car of the transportation.now it sits next to its bud (98 corvette pace car) in the garage. Thanks guys and gal for a great car buying experience. Now I can't wait for spring.

My first experience with Corvette Mike was when he was located in Laguna Hills. At that time, I had a 1965 coupe, which I still have.
Recently, I acquired a 1996 Collector’s Edition convertible and wanted upgrade it with new wheels and tires.  I met with Chris and we discussed the options available; I wanted to leave all the original components, wheels and tires intact.    After several discussions with him, he was able to locate the items I was looking for.  Shortly thereafter, they were installed.
My experience with Corvette Mike was a most positive experience, due to the assistance of Chris and Neida.   Thanks, Chris and Neida!
I look forward to returning to Corvette Mike’s .< /Review>

<review>Corvette Mike is the best corvette shop I had the pleasure od dealing with.  Other shops were afraid of takin on the challenge of working on installing the 383 Ls1 in my car...  everyone is very friendly and pet friendly too!

Scott is the mechanic who worked on my car, not only did he kept me informed on every step but he took the time to correct issues and go the extra mile to make sure he saves me some money along the process.

Now, that my car is done, the car is stronger than ever, overall I am very satisfied with everything scott did to my car. I will recommend this shop to any of my corvette buddies.

Thank you!!!<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

I wouldn't take my vette anywhere but Corvette Mike's. I used to go to a major trusted dealer (Connell Chev in Costa Mesa...dishonest!!) for all my service needs until the day they randomly said i needed rear end seals and a water pump. I told them to put it together and don't do anything. I took the car to Carl at Covette Mike's as recommended by a friend, and he was awesome. He checked it out and found no issues...and didn't charge me! That was 6 years ago! One more example, I had a leak in coolant that i couldn't find and took it to Carl. He found a hose clamp that was replaced sometime before my ownership that was the wrong size and replaced with the correct one...at no charge! Corvette Mike's is super fair and honest and I trust them completely with my "baby". You get what you pay for at Corvette Mike's. Don't be stupid, trust your "baby's" needs with Corvette Mike's.

<Review>Prior to purchasing a 2001 C5 Magnuson supercharged Corvette from a private party, I had Scott Binder @ Corvette Mike's conduct a pre-purchase inspection of the vehicle.  The detailed inspection report noted some repairs the car needed, so I went ahead and had Scott do the work after I bought it.  He took care of all the needed service and repairs the car required at a reasonable price and I am very happy.  I believe Scott genuinely cares about making sure my car receives the best service and I am very comfortable with the purchase, knowing my vette will be in the best care when future service and repairs are needed.< /Review><Time>1480704647614</Time>< gmapID>

I called Corvette Mikes last week looking for some help with my car.  I was happy to find a good bunch of people that really know their stuff.  A short drive to Anaheim took me to what seemed like a muscle car museum, but no it's just their showroom. There were dozens of perfectly kept classics, both old and some new. Corvettes, Camaros, Firebirds, and Ferrari. All neatly parked, so you could enjoy walking amongst the icons.
I found my way through to the parts department where i struck up a conversation about my car and why i was there. Everyone i spoke to seemed to know my car just as well as i do. I could tell these guys can be trusted with a car i've had for 20 years.

I definitely recommend checking this place out.<//Text>

< Review>
Hi , My name is Mike , and I personally had a fantastic experience at CORVETTE MIKE"S , I did business with them 13 years ago on my 2004 corvette , and 13 years latter I'm back , I had the Phase 1 performance package done W/new manifold air INTAKE , Throttle body , Diablo   computer , and Borla exuast , from start to finish I was reassured with there expertise and knowledge and felt I was in good hands , I thought they would have my car a few days and actually they delivered early , They explained and showed me everything that was done and workman ship was exceptional . I couldnt be more happy . Thank you Corvette MIKE"S ! ! ! !    :-))< /Review>

I have been going to this library for nearly 30 years and I have always had the best time!

There's something about a quiet place full of books that makes me happy. I have so many good memories at this place. If been to sleepovers, classes, study groups, and more at the Main Branch.

I can't praise it enough. Although, the books outside are 25¢ now =P< /review>

It's really quiet! The staff was respectful and the selection of books is quite vast! Ranging from manga to auto-biographies, it's got variety. There's also a specific section for children which was really adorable and has activities for the children which I think is a big plus! They also have movie rentals 👀<//Review>

<Text>Great library. I was only able to go inside the building a few times before the pandemic, but I loved it each time - it feels like home. They have adjusted to the pandemic well by allowing curbside pickup. The staff is always friendly and helpful. Great place!< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

This library gets two stars only because the library's book selection is pretty good, not awful, though it could be better even for a city library. The main issue is that I went on a Sunday to return a book, and okay, the library is closed on a Sunday, BUT they've decided to BLOCK the outside book return slot so I can't even drop off my books. That wasted me a trip up there, and for no reason. You NEED to have a non-automated way to drop off books when the library is closed.< /Text>

< review>
I am so disappointed with the library.  I go here constantly, about 3-5 days out of the week to work.   There have been many instances where they are either rude, or straight up idiots.   I always use their private room, which are available for reservation for a 2 hour period and today has just upset me so much.   I asked if there was a room available, an older white guy with glasses says all the rooms are occupied and that it was first come first serve.  First available room would be open at 2:30.   A guy walks out of one of the rooms and I ask about it.   He says there was a guy before me, but could not provide a name or recall who.  It took him awhile.  The part that confuses me, is why do they say first come first serve, when in reality they are making a list.  If that was the case, take names (idiots!).   Second, I am waiting at the table for a room to open and a guy comes up to the desk.  Joanne the other library aide, knew I was waiting for a room.   So she calls downstairs to see if it is available and finds an available room.  Guess who she gives it to??? The guy who came 30 minutes after me.   The people who work here are idiots, but the saddest thing??? You can't do anything about it.  There's no way to make a complaint on the Public Library's website.</review>

I love this branch...the employees are always very helpful. If I have a problem they take the time to help explain the issue. I appreciate them. Also check out the bookstore from the Friends of Orange Libary they are amazing and the prices can't be beat<//Text>

<Review>The library claimed that I turned in a severely water damaged book back in November of 2016. They claimed that they sent me both an email and invoice. I received nothing.
They no longer have the book. I am not paying for a book they can't show me.
I know for a fact that when I turned it in there was nothing wrong with it. I put it in the return bin outside.
They claim it's $14.99< /Review><UserId.>112472654026733830924< /UserId.><GmapID>0x80dcd9e68c2482b1:0x4c67fbcf321e5413</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
as a library it's ok, although for a while there was one white guy working there who seemed a bit like a bully...not sure if he's still there.. I always kind of felt like I was in "his library" rather than the community's library..BUT the REAL REASON I am taking time to make this review is related to an incident that occurred. I was at the library one day and as I was leaving a young man came up to me and said, "Excuse me, I think I hear a baby crying in the van over there..." He wanted me to help. So I walked over to the vehicle and SURE ENOUGH there was a baby inside. We couldn't see it but we could hear it. All the windows were closed & doors locked, so we went into the library together and reported it...and they made an announcement over the loudspeaker. We waited outside to see if somebody would come and eventually somebody did. What BOTHERED ME in addition to the potential danger the baby was in..was that as we gathered around to watch to make sure the baby was ok, one of the library employees tried to tell us to GO AWAY, as if it was NONE OF OUR BUSINESS if the baby is ok or  not. I backed up but did NOT LEAVE..I had to see for myself..turns out the woman worked at a daycare and this baby was one of many children she had taken to the library that day, the others were old enough to enjoy the kids program, but the infant was left in the van...apparently with no concern that it might get too hot in there. The library employee seemed to be more intent on "white washing" it. They did NOT even thank us, and seemed to be ready to let it go at that. But I CALLED the POLICE and reported it. And I am glad to say an officer came immediately...and a report was made to social services etc, ..I eventually was called as a witness in a hearing..not sure what happened in the end. Main thing we hope the baby was okay. Just wish the library had been a little more TRANSPARENT about the issue and had shown some appreciation rather than trying to cover it up. As citizens we are ALWAYS watched and being told what we are doing wrong...be it driving or parking, but never being THANKED or appreciated for moments such as this ..when we may have saved a baby's life.< /Review>

Superb, friendly owner and staff.

<Text>I had a tire checked for a leak but no leak. But was told after the fact that it would be $10 . It was a little steep and so I offered the owner $20 to rotate my tires since the tire was off and no leak he said $30 . Never mind. The crew is good but this tight wad smh has been going there for 5 years. No bueno<//Text><pics>None< /pics><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

<rate>5</rate><text>Honest, fast and direct service. Honda was going to charge me $230 for two replacement wheels that they said they couldn't patch. I came here and found out it was only 2 small nails, one didn't even puncture the back tire all the way through. I was charged $30 and was extremely happy with saving $200.

Also, they offered to replace the tires at $30 a pop. Not sure about the old reviews, this place does have a little reputation but I think if you treat them with kindness and respect you'll be taken care of.</text>< gmap_id>

<Text>Would not recommend. Went here to grab a used tire for my 97 Nissan maxima. Tire costs $35. Not bad except they do not Balance the tires when they install them. They charge extra for this even though every other tire shop does this as a courtesy.<//Text>< Name>

I purchased a used tire (35$) that went flat the next day . I returned and was told I ran over a nail and I had to pay for a patch (15$).

2 Months later. EXACT SAME THING,
purchased a used tire, It went flat the next day
Returned to the shop
and they tried to charge me for a patch
for the nail I supposedly ran over.

When I asked, "WHY, EVERY TIME I BUY ONE OF THEIR TIRES, I RUN OVER A NAIL THAT SAME DAY. ON THE EXACT SAME TIRE THEY SOLD ME?"
The owner said "if it happens 10 times, doesn't matter, Its my fault."
they refused to fix my tire unless I pay more.

The tires SUCK almost as much as their customer service</Text>

This is my first go-to spot if I'm looking for good used tires. Been going here for over 10 years. Expect to spend $30-$40 per tire that will last at least 6 months.< /text>

You can’t beat that price for such a good pizza! And they put plenty of toppings on! Also, the service is always excellent.<//review>< gmapID>

I buy 10 or less pizzas here on a monthly basis for over 2 years+. Quality products with prompt family owned & operated. My usual purchase of the "favorite faves" selection is $6 daily, $5 on Fridays... It just so happens that on Friday I replenished my inventory with "5" favorite faves, in turn $5 saved & life may once yet again be  pizza  & harmony because on any given day if it happens to rain ... By a commitment to a tradition since the mid 80's, "I ALWAYS BBQ MY PIZZA TO BRONZE THE CRUST TO A SUPPORTIVE POINT OF CRISPY ON A NON-STICK TREATED EXPANDED METAL
WOOFER GRID SPEAKER GRILL. TRUE STORY. WHEN USING GAS BBQ USE INDIRECT HEAT WITHOUT CARDBOARD (I FREEZE MINE) TIL CHEESE MELTS, FALLOWED BY LOWEST HEAT DIRECTLY (shifting pizza position often) TIL BRONZED TO UR IDEAL POINT OF PERFECTION. WEBER BBQ RECOMENDED, GAS BBQ TAKES Practice & in some situations a barrier plate between pizza & flame is or can be a really good idea. T S.2= true story also✓</review>

<text>Absolutely great service! Lydia was wonderful help and so glad I chose this over Rusty's or Domino's. Takes like 15 min to bake and Lydia recommended the Cinnamon wheel which was super bomb! This was my first time doing any "take n bake" but Papa Murphy's has a new loyal customer they use great ingredients. Taste quality, definitely Recommend 🤤🤯</text>< gmapID>

Great pizza & salad! To hot to cook 106'!
Cooked on the bbq: put  a piece of foil on grill 1st, then a pizza stone then set your pizza on the stone for 12 min. @425 yum yum yummy!!!
Great way to cook pizza!< /Review>

Easily the best Mexican food in riverbank. The grilled chicken is so good. Get in in a burrito. Plus the salsa is always fresh and you get way more than you pay for. Great prices. We eat here often.</text>

<review>San Jose Taqueria is quintessential 209 Taqueria-fare:  extra average food at high prices.  You're going to drop $3 on a get-it-yourself drink and $8 on really forgettable food.  I stopped by at  noon on a Thursday and no one was there--except some old guy talking to himself and me.  For 30 minutes no one came in the place.  This should be your first clue.  On a weekday at lunch time a restaurant has no one in the place:  there's a problem.

At some point, we will get better Mexican food.  When is anyone's guess, but San Jose Taqueria is not it.<//review><GmapID>0x8090576c60b061d5:0xb538ff9dd836f20b</GmapID>< Time>

A Modesto classic, been going here for over 20 years and still never let down. Burritos are awesome - try if you haven't.</text>

If I could give them negative stars I would. They gave me the wrong food it was not what I ordered and it was all made sloppy and just thrown in boxes my tostadas should have been ceviche but they gave me asada and it was all soggy and gross. I then called to see if they could correct my order and the woman that answered the phone was extremely rude. I started to tell her what happen with my order and the other phone started to ring she told me hold on in the middle of me talking and answered the other phone and took their entire order before getting back on the phone with me. This place is good but the customer service is TERRIBLE!!!<//text>

Place is nicely laid out with great selection of flower and concentrates. Though the buds can be a little pricy like most dispensaries, they always have smaller bud deals that are reasonable, usually avg. 8 bucks a gram. Plus they have the best quality and best price concentrates than any dispensary I've ever been to.</review>

For its location, it is a great small dispensary. Great customer service with a knowledgeable staff person. However there was only one bud tender on a holiday weekend, and it's the 1st. The waiting lounge was very comfortable though. It was nice to socialize with other people in the community. It was also pet friendly. Our little guy seemed to make everyone happy as usual. 🐶 😉< /Text>

Very nice & helpful staff. Good selection, unfortunately, at the time, they had a limited supply of plants. It was explained that in the spring they have a better selection, as a bulk of their customers grow outdoors. The girl behind the counter was great in helping me find what I needed to help with my pain. She gave several recommendations, & I am loving what was recommended!
👍

<text>Very friendly staff, nice selection, decent prices..
I believe this is going to take the place as my go to shop as the other store I was going to has become sorta off putting and a little rude most times I've been in there lately.. just because I don't get to go in very often is no reason to be condisending when I do!! But enough about the other shop, THANK GOODNESS I decided to go to Lakeside Herbal Solutions, everyone was very friendly and smiling. I got nice product and the price seemed fair... (Unlike the other place where the prices keep going up and up and up, wth?)< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

<text>UPDATE: I've learned a lot since my first review. The prices here are outrageous. A slightly longer drive to Ukiah saves a ton. I made the mistake of not doing my homework today and got some terrible advice from the girl behind the counter. She was really nice but I paid top dollar for the lowest THC concentrations there were. I guess maybe no one was buying them? I wouldn't have either! I got home and looked at the website but I didn't have my glasses with me when I was out. Doubt I'll ever go there again. They got 2 stars because #1 they exist and serve this community and #2 they deliver in Lake County.< /text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x80838bcc51fdc151:0xc416809c34c79302</Gmap_id></record>

<Review>Worst dispensary ever!!!! I tell you what in Santa Rosa King's Garden is 30 a gram at Lakeside 55 and they're trying to blame it on taxes?TF<//Review><Response>{'time': 1547653462806, 'text': 'Can’t  make everyone happy as we don’t make the prices.  King’s garden is actually around $55-$60 an eighth out the door here which equates to around $15 a gram.  We don’t sell grams of king’s garden flower.'}</Response>< Rating>

With prop 64 passing we are limited to few distributors.  The distributors have high prices due to the fact there’s very few of them.  Excise tax is now being collected which adds another 24%.  If we could control the prices I’m sure we wouldn’t be getting reviews like this.  We can only thank the voters who passed prop 64 a wolf in sheeps clothing.'}< /response>< time>

Stopped in for lunch. The place was moderately busy. Friendly and helpful lady took our order. Took about 15 minutes. Delicious fresh food. We received what we ordered. Good place to eat but outside seating is limited. Parking is not the greatest. Had to park in front because a large truck was blocking spaces behind deli.< /Text>

I was not disappointed and so happy. Thank you for the incredible shake and helping me leave having hope in humanity again.< /review></record></dataset><record>

The cheese in the torpedo was hard, couldn't bite through it. Potato salad tasted good but very watery. If I go again, I'll try the chipotle chicken wrap.< /review>

The chilaquiles are my go to, but  they definitely have not been making them the same lately. They forgot my order as I was waiting patiently for it. A few people who had placed their orders after mine received their orders first. After about ten minutes the lady asked me what my order was turns out that's when they actually started it. I waited another ten minutes. At least she gave me a free drink, but I think some definitely has to change.<//Text>

Pretty amazing sandwiches. Haven't ordered anything else so my opinion is limited. Wait for food is kinda harsh.<//Review>

<review>Other than parking being a bit of a challenge, this place is great. Today I had the chipotle chicken plate with an arugula salad and mashed potatoes. Sooooo tasty . Then washed it down with a tangy lemonade with mint.</review></record>

Ain't bad. This is the place to go for what I recall is the "sunrise platter" (might be what it's called. Don't hold me to it). Slices of ham, hash browns with cheese, gravy, bacon, and a couple of eggs. Super savory, and packs in the flavor. This was written during covid so I can't speak for the dine-in experience but it's a busy spot so it's not like you're going to have a quiet or luxury dining experience. There's always a lunch rush. If a hearty, savory breakfast ain't doing it for you they got wraps, burgers, wings, and sandwiches. Specialty shakes are also displayed on their menu and though a little pricey you do get what you pay for. Parking is the only real pain of deciding to eat here. Either park around back if you don't see a spot in the front or I'd walk a block or so. Trust me, I drive around the area every day for work and it's safer and easier to pick a nice parking spot than to jam in some skinny spot where you're backing into the street or pulling some fancy maneuvers.< /text>

This is a cozy little restaurant with nice staff and great food for reasonable prices. I ate the Louisiana sausage plate and it was really good. It came with eggs, choice of potatoes or hash browns, choice of toast and eggs your way. The coffee was good as well. Will definitely keep this place in mind if I am ever in the area!</review>

<Time>1602180847366< /Time><Review>Hard core New Yorkers may be offended. Others may find this place quite delightful. A local eatery that is more like a dinner rather than a mom & pop joint.

The menu is vast and there is a dish for everyone including vegans, vegetarians, kids, fruitarians, dessert only, and those with no teeth. Meals range from a bagel to a full course, which includes breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

On this first time eat, I had the waffle plate and pastrami and cheese. I saw the French toast and malibu omelette. Which appeared quite appetizing. There is a variety of omelette creations that should be tried.

The waffle batter must have vanilla because it is truly flavorful. Crisp on the top and edges and soft on the outside. Not soggy. Not hard. Accurately cooked. The dish is accompanied by eggs and bacon for under $10 bucks. What is noticeable is the eggs appear to be larger in size and the waffle was delightful. Get whip cream instead of butter and syrup.

The pastrami had good flavor. Very cheesy. It also had lots of fat which became annoying to eat. Unless fat meat is your groove. However, the golden sourdough 🍞 and presentation of the meal was mouth-watering. I would not have the pastrami again but would try another sandwich with the grilled sourdough.

Portion size was more than adequate. I arrived@130 pm and timeliness of order was 10 minutes. Food is prepared upon order. Masha are required. Seating is limited but it is not a place to eat and hangout all day. Wheelchair accessible. Dine-in is available but you'll likely eat outside. Parking? Prepare to walk about a block. Bathroom, unisex toilet, was decent but on the verge of a scary gasoline pit stop bathroom. Prices are similar to "diner eating."</Review><gmapID>0x80d95a064f35e5c3:0xca5d6d698eeb5911<//gmapID>< username>

I moved from Colorado a year ago and I always look for good food, specially burritos. I been living by this place since we arrived here in San Diego and always drive by this restaurant and though to my self, I need to stop by and try their food since most of the places around here have not cut it. I finally tried their breakfast burritos and I have to say that I was shocked to see the size. This burrito was huge compared to all the other places in San Diego. I then tried the following day their grill sandwiches and they are amazing. Hamburger meet, delicious.  Our friend tried their milk shake and he was so happy with the taste. This has become our favorite place. They have soups, salads, sandwiches, burgers, burritos, wings... basically has something different for everyone.  Please owners, keep up the great food and service and you'll have clients for life and we have already recommended this place to our close friends.</review>

I had a healthy breakfast there, and it was great. I will be a regular customer there. My only concern is I'm not a fan of cops. I will  only go when it's not loaded with cops. Great food nice eating on the patio.</Review>

<Name>Scott V.</Name><user_id>109755414358781303208<//user_id><Text>So, I was craving a sandwich, and this place was rated a top place in the area. It's definitely a small nit spot. Food is pretty good, definitely has that deli, east coast, community, city, corner street vibe. I got the Boston Beef Special. It wasn't bad. The coleslaw was a little over empowering though. The menu is pretty big, with a wide selection to choose from. It was pretty busy, when I was there. Seats were definitely taken up. But, customer service was really nice. They took the time to service the tables right away, so people could sit. Parking is a bit of a pain though. Small lot, with that city congested vibe to it. Lol. I gave this place 4 stars, probably because it was hot and I was irritable. Lol.< /Text><rate>4<//rate>< GmapID>

I bought one of their smoothies tonight and it was melted.  I asked the girl at the register how long ago it was made and she said the bananas were softer.  Gave it to my husband and he said it wasn't even cold.
I won't be going back there for a while if ever.  $7.00 smoothie and they give me an old one.  No thank you.< /text>

<UserId.>101456608566040228068<//UserId.><Text>Have been here once before and was not impressed the first time. This time though was much better. It is Covid season right now. But I was still allowed to dine on the little patio.

I got the Malibu omelette plate and a glass of milk.. 12.00. Shrimp, cheese, vegetables. It had a chipotle sauce, which I could have done without, little spicy for my old self, but it was flavorful. Good mess of home fries, sourdough bread. I enjoyed it. Will come back to try thier shakes and maybe a few other things.

I read the other reviews and one person said they wouldn't go if cops were there. Sad you think that way. I've been on the wrong side of cuffs, but I hold no I'll will towards them. Review the food... not the patrons.

This a follow up. I wrote the last review 6 months ago. At the height of Covid. And have been back 3 or 4 times since. And always it was good. Now it's the end of March and it's like a totally different place. Covid is on the downslide, its warm and the patio is open again. I ordered eggs over medium and I got hard. Instead of a plate I got a to go box. And the cashier seemed to have an 'I don't care' attitude. Sad that it went this way. I drove about 8 or 9 miles to eat here. Passed 2 Denny's and an IHOP along the way. Sad sad sad. You guys just lost a regular customer. Hopefully it was a 1 time thing and your customer base is still happy. But I will never know. Won't be back anymore.< /Text>< Pics>

Food is good, menu is extensive.  Parking and ambiance are awful.  Prices are average. Breakfast is served all day.  Outside dining is in weird tent structure near the street. They do a large takeout business.</Text>

<Text>This place was good many years ago. Not today lady brought our plates couldn't even tell the difference between our sandwiches. The Miami Nosh and the Brooklyn Reuben.  One is cornbeef with sauerkraut, the other pastrami with coleslaw.  they are out of coleslaw so that should of helped.  His sandwich had twice the meat as mine and that wasn't much. Same tough meat on both sandwiches one should have been cooked different.  Fries under cooked.</Text><GmapID>0x80d95a064f35e5c3:0xca5d6d698eeb5911< /GmapID><date>1566079167168</date><Name>Sunni Ellis< /Name></record></dataset><record>

<Text>We have been there twice. Really good burgers. Chicken Chipotle is also very good, a bit spicy so beware but very good flavor. They also do breakfast and sandwiches which were very good. Fries are ok as well. Not a lot of tables as I think most of their business is take out. Staff are friendly and helpful. They make the food to order so it is not fast but worth the wait.< /Text><user>115096641206882752022<//user><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

<review>There's nothing New York about this deli.
I called and they don't even know what a bacon egg and cheese is.
Such disrespect to the New York name.
You're better off going to a New York style bagel shop near carmel mountain.</review>< time>

This was our first visit to Sunrise Deli, we we welcomed by the nicest young lady who a very contagious smile, the restaurant is very clean and the food is delicious, we both had the Turkey & swiss spinach wrap, it is served with fries and let me say that the portions are more than enough to satisfy even a big appetite.
This place is really a great choice for eithe breakfast, lunch or dinner, they have a extensive menu, HIGHLY RECOMMEND< /Text>

I drove 10mi to this place on a referral from a friend. I ordered the gyro and a couple of burgers. The burgers were ok  but the gyro was dry and overcooked with no sauce. DO NOT GET THE GYRO!! They did not allow me the opportunity to come back the next day to make it right. #nosauce< /review>

<text>Went for breakfast. Portion sizes were average, food was decent, but I thought it was overpriced for what I got.
They have gyros on the menu. I ask the girl behind the counter what is the gyros made from. She says jiroes??
This is a New York style deli (supposedly) that buys pre-packaged, pre-sliced gyros. Never got to ask about the tsitsiki sauce.

Note to owners: don't claim "New York" style deli if your gyros, corned beef, and pastrami are not legit. You need to make your own gyros and have it on a spit where you slice it fresh for the customer.<//text>< pictures>

<text>Service and recipes have changed a bit under new ownership, but it's still some of the best burgers & sandwiches I've ever had. Great variety, and reasonably priced. Breakfast, lunch or dinner, this is one of my go to spots. Expect to pay $7 for a kids meal though. And don't order the kids meal pizza. It's just a frozen, mini, microwaved pizza.< /text>< Pics>

This place is right around the corner of my house, I'm talking walking distance. Very delicious 90% of the time when I don't forget to remove an ingredient but that's on me.  This is my go to place when I don't know what I wanna eat.  They make what I consider a very tasty clam chowder but this is where I first tried it so I could be wrong...I doubt it.<//Text>

This store cooks very good food. Love the Philly cheesesteaks sandwiches. But since that's the only thing I do buy there, I cannot comment on the other food they prepare. But I do continue to go back for my Philly cheesesteak.< /review>

<Text>My husband and I just moved to the area and decided to try out Sunrise Deli. We have been back many times since! They have an extensive menu and cook the food to order so it is always hot and fresh. The staff are always super friendly (except for the one young girl who couldn't hear us because she didn't want to take her headphones out haha!). The majority of the time, our food is delicious and the prices are great. I do have to check before we leave each time though because 1) they always leave on the tomato when I ask for none and 2) the bacon is never crispy even though we ask. These are such minor details though. Overall, I am very happy with our experiences here. I would not come here if you're in a rush, or at least call ahead. They do cook your food when you order so it takes about 10-15 minutes to get your food. That is worth it to us! It is also about half the price of similar restaurants for what you're getting. Both my husband and I can get a full meal for under $20 and it's a lot of food! Even the kids meals are good sized. You will get your monies worth!< /Text><Gmap_id>0x80d95a064f35e5c3:0xca5d6d698eeb5911</Gmap_id>< Pictures>

<Review>K I will try not to be repetitive but this place has really good Sandwiches and breakfast . Lunch is always good and i may add there own mix of Thousand island dressing is way good.  Wait time can be a 7-12 mins sometimes for food to come out but trust me.. its worth it and the Staff is always friendly. PS it can get packed on Sat and Sunday Morning and the Local Fire DP and Police frequent this place, because they love the food : )< /Review>< Pics>

<text>Sunrise deli was the best restaurant in town and one of my favorite places to go every week until they changed ownership couple months ago and now it's the worse place to go to! Their customer service is so bad and rude and the cashier doesn't even know how to take orders and she stairs at me when I ask her anything about the menu! So sad about losing this place!</text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

My favorite menu item is the New Jersey Devil sandwich.  But I've sampled plenty of other items, and have never been disappointed.  This is my go-to place for lunch.  They produce an amazing variety of great food in such a tiny kitchen!< /review>

I used to love this place used to eat here all the time!  But ever since it's been sold the food is not the same the people are not as nice they are actually quite rude.  Was in there the other night ordered a patty melt on sourdough.  When I received it it was on rye bread the waitress says no it's sourdough so I took a bite.  No this is rye bread.  She then took the plate and was going to have our order remade.  She brings it back on sourdough I pick it up to take a bite and they use the same Patty that I took a bite out of that's just gross.  And after on top of that they serve just the cold french fries from the previous plate!  And then my daughter witnessed the cook touching raw meat and then preparing our sandwich.  I proceeded to the counter stated my complaint got my money back and I will never go back!<//Text>

<Name>Phyllis Davis< /Name><Review>They must have change owner.
The potatoes salad was awful.  I ordered a hot pastrami lettuce was so tuff I couldn't eat it . They put too much on.
I had to pay for some pasta salad when it should have been free since I couldn't eat the potato salad..
I don't I will be going back.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

I unequivocally had one of the best breakfasts  I've ever had.
Places nicely decorated very clean and food was excellent.
This place is a deli.
Staff is very friendly.
Great job.
Move over Janet's Cafe and Shirley's kitchen.
Someone else's risen to the top
Is comprised of two eggs over easy hash browns sourdough toast refried beans and flour tortillas
salsa was excellent.< /Text>

<Text>Nasty hot dogs and zucchini.
The hot dog had a slice of cheese melted in a microwave with the bun. And some old bacon to top it off.

Worst hot dog. Made me sick after eating here.

This small place has always been a favorite of mine. The sandwiches are huge and the wide selection is really great. They recently renovated and changed ownership, but the food is as good as ever. I love the Monte Cristo.<//text>

< Review>
This place used to be the best under the old management. I ordered a BLT with Avocado on Grilled sourdough, I got soggy bread, like the grill wasn't hot enough, only 2 pieces of bacon on the whole sandwich, and no Avocado. When I called in my orders, the guy seemed super preoccupied and had a side conversation going about some "dude". Like I said, I used to go there all the time, now it just doesn't compare.</Review>

< Review>
Usually amazing food , super friendly employees , think they hired a new girl and needs to be trained on a little bit of customer service, which is okay because I’ve visted dozens of times and it’s always great. But she’s messed up 3 different orders already 2 friends of mine have complained about her service /attitude .

Buts it’s all good nothing that can’t be trained and spoken about .

Overall great food and awesome service!</Review>

This classic CDO sandwich shop is great. From the popular healthy Turkey avocado to the coronary clobbering monte carlo there is something for everyone. One big surprise is their soups are some of the best in town especially the chicken tortilla. All home made!<//Text>
