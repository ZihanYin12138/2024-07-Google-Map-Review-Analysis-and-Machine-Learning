< Review>
My family and I ate here since 2008 when we moved to Lemon Grove. The food was delicious but the man working the front counter always made us come back. Once he recognized us as regulars, he would ask how we are doing and seemed like he really cared for us. Even when we moved away, we always came back to this restaurant because we consider the food here our comfort food. It breaks my heart seeing this place closed since covid hit. I just want you to know that I hope you and your family is doing well.< /Review>

My family I used to eat here and enjoyed the food.  I love their shrimp and snow peas, Terriyaki and/or Lemon Chicken, Beef with broccoli, etc.  Not to mention, they even serve Viatnamese and Japanese food as well as Chinese food.  They serve delicious and nutritious food.  Plus, the prices were reasonable.  Unfortunately, this place is out of business thanks to COVID-19.  I wish this place was back in business.  This place is a gem in Lemon Grove.</review>

I ordered here via BeyondMenu and I am saddened that quality control slipped to a 3 out of 10 stars.

I ordered two appetizers and two entrees.  One entree was incorrect (right dish, wrong protein) and the appetizers ..well let's say more care could have gone into the food prep.

There were shells present in the shrimp entree. (When, I ordered Kung-Pao Chicken).

The BBQ pork fried rice had huge chunks of fat and tendon sitting in it .. and there was no bbq to be found.  and the fried rice was a bit scorched this time around.

The fried shrimp appetizer .. had clearly been fried hours ahead of time based on the fact that it was served at room temperature, and rock hard.

It is really a shame, that service was absymal enough that I am here posting this.  Normally Panda-house is our "Go-to" place for easy Chinese takeout.  But this left a bad taste in our mouth's.   Figuratively and Literally.</text>

I got the BBQ Pork Chow Fun, wife got Sweet & Sour Chicken.  Both were excellent.  While it is obvious that they maintain a cleaning regimen for the floor, tables, and chairs (even the ceiling fans were clean), they miss a lot, making the place a bit uncomfortable.  There were obvious splashes of food/juice on the wall paneling above some of the tables, and a very grimy baseboard-to-floor area.  The whole place could use a good scrubbing and new paint.  We will go again, but probably take-out rather than eat-in.< /text>

There was a big cockroach in my teapot... Thankfully decided to take the lid off to let the tea cool down, so glad I did not drink that! Bad bad hygiene. Would not recommend this place  at all.< /review>

I have been a customer for years. Excellent and friednly customer service. The food looks and tastes so fresh, like home made. I guess no MSG added, like in orher places. The prices are very economic and the plates well served. The pkace is modest but clean. I highly recommend it.<//Review>

The gentlemen who takes my orders is very polite and curtious, I've yet to experience any negative moments during my monthly visits.

The chicken is pan seared on the outside and moist on the inside. The sauce is savory in the sweeter side and really makes the chicken complete. This also comes with the freshest veggies and a side of white rice. I highly recommend ordering this! Depending on if you are ordering a small or a large the prices range from $7-$9 but can feed 2 people!

My equally favorite item to order here are the chicken and pork banh mi sandwiches. It included picked cucumber, carrots, daikon, and sweet grilled onions, cilantro and pepper to top it off! Beware of the jalepenos! Those are hot for me but really give it a kick.

I usually stick to these items, but their chow mein is also very tasty. And my mom loves their won ton soup.

If you are in the area stopping here is a must! This restaurant doesn't get a ton of people that eat in and is mainly delivery or pick up. Don and his brother are very friendly and we love coming here!!!</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

< review>
The food was great. Clean and clean, I got the vegetarian platter,  I will admit the prices are steep and I can't compare it to other Mediterranean cuisine since I've only really had this place so from that aspect I can only give my opinion. I also have ordered the meals through phone and picked up so I can't say it took long. Overall the food and quality were great but I'll definitely be trying other joints to make better judgment on taste and price.<//review>

<text>I visit this unique place from time to time because I like the special air that is outline this place. The crew is extremely cordial and qualified. The service is remarkablywonderfully efficient. Most important, the food you eat is highly distinguished. I ate there more than once and I was always happy. The cost is reasobable. I highly suggest this place to to all.<//text><userid>117835193806204920322<//userid><user_name>Russell Hamilton< /user_name><Response>None< /Response>< Rating>

<time>1580775638330< /time><rating>1<//rating><text>UGH!!! It never fails! Each and every OTHER time I come into this Tofa’s location, there is a problem with my food. For the price and the location this is UNACCEPTABLE! Normally when I come I order babba ganoush, hummus, or for the first time today, the lentil soup. Sounds simple right? Today my lentil soup was served with a healthy serving of brown curly hair and the babba ganoush was sour! I almost wonder if I’m being “pranked” when I come here because this happens ALL TOO OFTEN with my orders! You would think that I would have stopped doing business with them but because I literally live 4 minutes up the street and LOVE Mediterranean food, I put aside my differences and return. However this is the last time this location will earn my business! I am emphatically disgusted and horrified. Because these are franchised locations, of course there is no manager on site or access to a corporate number. Today I was given information for someone named Laila and forwarded her the picture of my soup . Now it’s beginning to make total sense why, despite the number of growing restaurants near this establishment, that it is ALWAYS seemingly empty! Think twice before you pay the price or decide to order hairball stew from this location. YUCK and YIKES!!!< /text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMp1GM6qYodca6jAVJGhpAD_K4mRXjN1Xl2wl2B=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

Tofas Mediterranean Grill has very good quality food. The restaurant is always clean and has great ambience. The employees are always nice and professional. If you are debating if you should give it a try, I highly recommend it!</Text>

<Review>Clean establishment, good customer service. The food is made to order thus it is a bit slower than many restaurants of the same vain. The plate I ordered was substantial with a pita and huge side of hummus. Hummus was tasty, garlic sauce was a bit bland, salad and tabouleh were decent but my falafel was a little overcooked.</Review>< pics>

<Resp>None</Resp><review>Good food, however my falafel wrap was a little overcooked. Maybe the cook was having an off day. This won't prevent me from coming back to try other dishes such as pizza, burgers, or fries. The cashier was very friendly and I liked the modern decorations. There is also an outdoor patio outside.</review>< Pictures>

<text>Pretty inside and very clean and  Nice and cool with great music.
Everything tastes homemade and I'm pretty sure that it is.
Found it on accident but we will be coming back for sure.<//text><user_id>114234547710178731464</user_id>< Resp>

< Review>
The wait time was about 40minutes for a family of 5. I ordered 3 kids Chicken Shwarma bowls and 2 Chicken Shwarma with Fatoush Salad. About 30 minutes waiting, the server came up and said that they were closing in 10 minutes so she arranged for everything to be placed in to go containers, no problem with that. The food arrived 9 minutes later minus 1 chicken with salad that came 8 minutes after that. The most upsetting part about the meal was the kids Chicken Shwarma, I paid $7 a piece for a handful of cooked rice with 1/4 piece of chicken. Essentially $21 for 1 chicken breast and 2 1/2 cups of rice and 3 Capri Suns. This was my second visit to this location, the first being somewhat pleasant but I will not be returning due to this experience.</Review>

Unorganized and slow. Went in for Hummus and it took 20 mins. There wasn't 10 customers in the store there was 3. There is like 5,6 people in the back, 2 girls in the front. These guys are ridiculous. Incase the person who owns this store or runs the store has any pride in there work. Here is when it happened. Wednesday Nov 1st @ 6pm. Best advice TRAIN PEOPLE before they are left alone with paying customers.<//text>

First visit was fine. Ordered the gyro and enjoyed it with no issues. Second visit was a bit more frustrating. Ordered chicken shawarma and sat down to wait. Staff dropped it off to the adjacent table who ordered after me even after making an attempt to let them know they are dropping my plate off to the wrong table. I let the staff know at the front that I believe they made a mistake, no big deal.

Front staff says "Oh no worries there is another one coming up." Cool, guess I'll wait a little longer. Sit back down and a few minutes later staff is bringing more food to the table next to me, the same one that ordered after me. Keep in mind they are a larger party. I'm just here on my lunch break trying to eat and get back to work. Feels bad to see a large party get served before a single order especially since they came in after I did.

This table looks at the food they're brought and say "Hey, I ordered the kebab not the shawarma." Hmm... I'm still patiently waiting, hoping they bring me my food soon. Staff starts heading my way, drops off chicken kebab, and says "Hey you were right, I accidentally gave your food to the other table." This is the part that kind of turned the whole thing sour, the gentlemen helping me turns around to walk back to the counter after acknowledging he gave my order away and then dropping off the other tables order in front of me. I had to stop him and ask if I could get the order I wanted.

Best part here, after waiting even longer, they bring my order out... to the other table.

Food is great, service seems...inconsistent. I'd probably go back, but not for a while. Maybe the staff needs some more training or experience to give customers a more consistent experience.<//Review>

<review>Tiger Auto Sales is a RIP off Tony, only smogs the car, changes oil, and checks break, does not do any kind of required maintenance to the vehicle as recommended by the maker. Daughter bought car 2 months ago and now its having issues, until someone Sue's him he will continue to rip people off, and I cant believe Lendnark is granting loans to his client not sure if they know how shady he is.</review>< Pics>

<response>None< /response><review>I got my car here for a very reasonable price, 3 years later and it has never given me any problems. When my husband and I lost our jobs he was more than willing to work with us in regards to monthly payments. I have recommended this place to friends and they thankfully, have had the same experience as us. It's a USED car and people expect it to run like if it was brand new, for the price you're paying I believe you're getting a deal.</review></record></dataset><record>

<username>Heroes Never Die</username><review>Bought a car from tiger auto sales in Fresno, After 1 day of having the car, it had an issue with the motor probably blown head gasket, radiator was spitting out milkshake for days. Took it back to tiger auto sales twice because they never fixed the problem, the owner kept telling me they fixed it but no work was ever done. 30 days went by warranty is up and I'm stuck with a car that makes Carmel frappes from the radiator. Plus they stole fuel out of my car too while it was in their so called shop. Don't recommend this place anyone. Go somewhere else you have been warned.< /review><UserId.>100921968480936909606< /UserId.>< Resp>

I was a first time buyer I put 1650 down on a car within a month the check engine light came on and I had to keep filling up the tires with air and they never fixed my passenger window. It isn't worth getting a car from here try your luck with someone else.< /Text>

Guy barely said anything while we were here. Just answered yes and no to our questions and seemed like he didn't want to sell us anything. They've lost my business. Poor service.<//text>

Daniela is a true professional.  She explained the details to the procedure and made sure I was well taken care of.
Dr Jeremy is extremely knowledgeable, his office is spotless and has the best staff!< /text>< pictures>

I have been struggling with hyperpigmentation and melasma for years. I don’t like the look of applying layers of  foundation or concealer to cover brown spots. I have tried many laser treatments, chemical peels, and skin care regimens. After my initial consultation at Skin Perfect I decided to try the Cosmelan Peel. Rachel was amazing!

Treatment: The first day she applied the Cosmelan mask treatment, which was similar to a mud mask that you wear for 10-hours and rinse off before bed. You don’t apply anything the next two days. By the third day I started to peel. That is when you start applying the at-home treatment both morning and night. It is very similar to a medium colored foundation. My face peeled around the forehead, cheeks, and chin area for the first week. I stayed indoors most of the time the first week. The second week had slight peeling, and seemed more dry around the chin and upper lip area. By the end of week two I went in for my follow up appt, which also consisted of an oxygen facial, my results were significantly noticeable. My skin had such an amazing glow to it. I did not need to wear any make up and it only appeared dry when wearing the at home product throughout the day. I bought a hydrating facial spritzer that I used every two hours to prevent the dryness from being noticeable. At one month you go in for another mask that you wear all day, exactly like the initial mask. The peeling and dryness was a lot less. After another two weeks you follow up with another oxygen facial and that’s when you notice the entire results. My pigmentation was gone, and my texture and pore size benefited from this treatment. I am extremely happy with the results. My only regret is not doing this a long time ago. If you can commit to the entire process; 10-hour mask for the first day, at home application morning and night for two weeks (without skipping), oxygen facials and follow up appts, second mask (all which is included in the price), and deal with the peeling (yes it will be noticeable for at least the first week or two), then you will have the best results.</Text>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>The best aesthetic med spa in the area without a doubt! Jeremy, Daniela, and Nadine were so friendly and treated me with so much care. The team here is so accommodating to all your needs.

This is my second time having CoolSculpting treatment done here and I can’t imagine going anywhere else. The whole process was so easy and comfortable; from being personally welcomed by Jeremy in his consult room, getting treatment scheduled with Nadine, and receiving my CoolSculpting sessions with Daniela — it was the best. The most exciting part: noticeable CoolSculpting results because of their knowledge and procedure!

I highly recommend Skin Perfect Aesthetics Glendora location to all my friends and family. I love that the team never pressures you into buying a ton of treatments, rather they compliment your natural self and our honest with their treatment recommendations! They are the best!</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80c32f5556b8a5c9:0x531ece40fafa8eed</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Daniela is wonderful. Thank you for everything.  You made me feel very comfortable. I highly recommend Skin Perfect for cool sculpting.  The facility is modern and clean. Entire staff was extremely friendly and helpful.  Everything was explained in detail and no pressure environment.  Update 9 months later....even though I had a good experience at skin perfect I don't recommend cool sculpting. Results are minimal for the high price tag.  I had a tummy tuck and lipo 15 years ago and I suggest going that route.  Results are much better and long lasting.</text>

<review>Came to skin perfect medical Glendora for the coolsculpting procedure. I felt very comfortable and in good hands. Daniela was amazing! She was very attentive to my needs (breaks, bathroom, hunger, thirst). She explained every step of the procedure getting me ready for the next step. All the staff is amazing and Jeremy Romaine MD knows what he's doing. He keeps me looking young but still natural. I've been to other places for fillers and dysport and always felt as though I looked a bit plastic. Not anymore! I'll continue to come to skin perfect medical and highly recommend them for any procedure. Thanks Skin Perfect Medical!<//review>< pics>

<UserId.>105129908376014810875</UserId.><review>I bought a series of treatment  (8) for   laser hair removal. I was given a special for 8 sessions if I paid the whole package which was $566 dollars. I understood that with this special each session was $70.00 dollars. I went to the firs treatment and I did not feel anything. I have had these kind of treatment and I usually felt a tingling sensation that indicates that the laser is picking up on hair follicles. However during the first treatment I did not feel anything. The technician that did the treatment  said that perhaps the intensity of the laser will increase in the next session. When I went to the second session I waited an hour to be treated. I was frustrated for the wait and then the treatment only lasted about five minutes and again I did not feel anything. I told the person
that did the treatment why I did not feel anything again. Not even the tingling sensation and it appeared she did not treat some areas. She said that I did not feel anything because they are using the latest technology. When I left I made the decision to ask for a refund. To make the story short they charged me for each session $179.00 unless I heard wrong. The money has not been returned to my credit card to corroborate this. If you decide to buy this treatment be smart. Ask a lot of questions and have them explain what would be the refund if you don't like it. I  learned my lesson. They just want your money.< /review><Rate>1< /Rate>< Pics>

I can't say enough about Jeremy and Nadine. I had my lips enhanced several years ago and it wasn't a good experience.  I swore I would never do it again, until yesterday. A very good friend of mine told me that she won't go to anyone else except Jeremy, he's incredible. Based on that, I decided to give it another try and I'm so happy I did. OMG, my lips look amazing and don't hurt at all, amazing. My husband even mentioned how beautiful they look. In addition to my lips I had some other injections to help my under eyes. I've spoken with my husband about the plans that Jeremy and I talked about doing and he told me based on what he's seen so far, he's all for it, yippee. I'll be calling to start scheduling my appointments for lasering procedures for my face and coolsculpting the body. Highly recommend. Don't be afraid like me, go for it.</Review>

Had a wonderful experience @Skin Perfect Medical Aesthetics today! The entire staff has been so warm, welcoming and generous with their time. I ask many, many questions and they are always patient and thorough. Jeremy is very professional and never  made me feel uncomfortable in that tiny blue room for pre/post pics or during my treatment. With his many years of experience, I know I’m in great hands! Huge hugs to Daniela. She is so gentle and walked me through the entire process. She even brought me in lunch, snacks, hot tea and set me up with Netflix during my 5 hour treatment. I would recommend SPMA to anyone looking to have a medical spa-like experience!</review>

When I was in CA, Jeremy administered C02 Fraxelated laser on my face, neck, and chest. The results were amazing. He did a great job at completely numbing the areas. I felt no pain -- I do have a high-pain threshold. About 6-7 days later my skin looked like a 5-year-old's. I trust this man's skill and expertise...won't be going anywhere else for this procedure except back to Jeremy.</Review>

Struggling with acne for a few years now , I have struggled to find the proper regimen for my skin to behave properly . Jeremy has helped me develop better skin habits and has given me the confidence to go make up free !!Nadine and the lovely staff have treated me like a girl at the spa on every visit . In my time seeing Jeremy , I've also received the most compliments on how great my skin is glowing . Thank you guys, I look forward to driving to Glendora now, aka your former Whittier patient .< /review>

<Text>Skin Perfect Medical Aesthetics in Glendora is an outstanding facility for Cool Sculpting.  Jeremy Romaine and Daniela Farias made my experience so unbelievably pleasant and I was completely satisfied with the procedure and results.  From the moment I walked in through the front door to the moment I left, I was well informed, very well taken care of, and always comfortable.  Jeremy and his team are extremely professional and caring.  Daniela Farias, the technician was the absolute best.  She walked me through each step of the procedure and made me feel at ease.
Jeremy was highly recommended by a colleague who was completely satisfied by her results.  After seeing her photos, I made an appointment for a consultation with Jeremy.  No matter how much exercise and proper nutrition I have implemented into my lifestyle, there were stubborn fat areas that I just could not get rid of from my abdomen, inner thighs, and underarms.  Jeremy, a well-experienced PA, listened to my concerns, answered all my questions, and assessed my figure.  He welcomed me to a live demo and after this presentation, I booked my appointment for August.  I was nervous, but Jeremy and Daniela helped me be at ease.  I have treated my underarms, inner thighs, back, abdomen, and love handles.  I have lost one to three inches in these areas.  The procedure itself was effortless.  Every application takes 35 minutes and once the applicator is attached, it gives a pinching sensation for about two minutes and then you do not feel a thing.  After the applicator is taken off, Daniela massages the area with a device for about two minutes.  The treated area is numb, so I barely felt the device, except for my back which was extremely painful.  Overall, my procedure and experience was great.  The only discomfort was the back massage and the garment that you have to wear after the treatment.  While the garment can be uncomfortable, it is worth wearing because it helps the results. I also received follow up text messages to make sure I was okay and a follow-up appointment after a month to look at results.  I love seeing the transformation of my treated areas.  I highly recommend Skin Perfect Medical Aesthetics in Glendora (Make sure to request Daniela, you will love her!).< /Text>< pics>

Spent 8 thousand dollars on 3 visits of around 2 hours with absolutely no change whatsoever, only pain, if that sounds like a good deal to you then go for it. Doesn't work just alot of hype and marketing !!!!!!< /text>

I choose this flower shop because I knew I was not going to be disappointed. they have top notch customer service and even followed up with a delivery confirmation. Thanks again for such and amazing delivery service.

The BEST! Kim personally created a beautiful bouquet and delivered it within  1 hour of the online order. Exceeded my expectations and even followed up with a call to confirm the delivery was made successfully. Top notch customer service and pride in their craft.

During a time like this with covid and restrictions especially in place for care facilities, this extra step was much appreciated and truly was above and beyond.

I received an incredible arrangement (with exotics!) yesterday for my birthday. The arrangement was stylish and beautiful, the flowers were really fresh, and the delivery was absolute perfection.

The most important factor here is that my sweetheart called Hey Flower Man from out of state to arrange this for me. That requires a lot of trust and good communication. They sorted everything out over the phone, and it went off without a hitch.

You can trust Hey Flower Man to do their very best for you.< /Review>

Hey Flower Man delivered a beautiful arrangement to my sister for her birthday! They also called me as soon as it was delivered. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a local flower shop for any occasion.< /Text>

I (Stephen) am not a flower expert, so I get nervous walking into a flower shop with so much variety to choose from. As soon as I walked in, I was welcomed with an uplifting attitude by Kim. He knew all the right questions to ask to make sure my special someone was well taken care of with some beautiful flowers! The experience was fun and didn't feel transactional in the slightest. Bree LOVES her new lilies, can't wait to see them open up this weekend. Thanks, Kim!<//review>

I ordered flowers from Colorado for a friend in Carlsbad. Delivery driver arrived when the house was blocked off. They called me right away and re delivered in the afternoon. Amazing communication and the flowers looked better in person than on the website! Phenomenal communication and product even better!</Text>

Such a wonderful experience. This is a REAL person who actually cares about what you want to send. I was remote to the person I was sending to. Not only was it a hard request it was a surprise request. A Random Act of Kindness that needed to be done anonymously and perfectly. Hey Flower Man was on it with a perfect delivery that made the person EXTREMELY HAPPY. If you want a happy delivery call HEY FLOWER MAN!!!!</Review>

<Text>This place is awesome. As a man who doesn’t know anything about flowers the shop makes it easy, they had a table filled with all different displays. I got a beautiful arrangement for $50 with the vase. You can’t go wrong here. The staff was really friendly too< /Text>< Rate>

I got my wife a bouquet for Valentine's Day, it was delivered to her work on time on probably the busiest day of the year, and she LOVES it. "They're really nice. Like my favorite bouquet ever." I would definitely recommend and use Hey Flower Man again.< /text>

Not only were the orchids and flowers more beautiful than the picture from which I ordered but I received a phone call after delivery which I wasn’t expecting from “the flower man” to tell me that the flowers were delivered and that the recipient was home. Excellent experience<//Text>

I buy flowers from several different vendors within the region and I am always impressed with the flowers that they have here. They offer much more styles and varieties that many of the other flower places.< /text>

<text>If I could give 6 stars I would.  I wanted to send flowers to my best friends mom who had just gotten out of the hospital.  The website said he couldn't deliver for a week.  I thought that was odd, so I called.  The Flower Man was headed out of town.  I called at 1PM and he was leaving in a couple of hours (they close at 3PM), when I explained my circumstances, he said he would deliver the flowers himself before he headed out that very afternoon.  I told him what I wanted, and he made a couple of recommendations.  He also told me once he delivered the flowers, he would call and let me know.  And sure enough, a couple of hours later I get the nicest vm on my phone.  My best friend's mom cried when she got her bouquet.  She said it was the prettiest she had ever seen.  If you want the BEST customer service from just a GREAT guy and the freshest, most BEAUTIFUL flowers, you must order from Hey Flower Man!!  Thanks so much.  6 stars for sure.< /text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>{'time': 1551806228316, 'text': 'Thank you I am happy for your wonderful experience and she loved her flowers'}<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80dc720e3cd17445:0x138f0c2d4b4eaf88<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

We ordered flowers from Hey Flower Man the day before my uncle's funeral and they were very accomodating to have the flowers delivered the next morning at 9:00 am.  So easy to use their website and when I called to verify delivery they were so pleasant and nice to work with! Highly recommend!  I got a picture of the flowers that were ordered as well as I wasn't able to attend and they were beautiful! They will take care of you!< /review>

<review>I was visiting a friend in Carlsbad and wanted something cheerful to give her. A local suggested The Flower Man just up the street and I couldn’t be happier to find him! Another friend and I easily found his shop, looked around, he asked a few questions...and Voila! He put together a bright little basket of two plants, tied a sweet bow around a heart tucked in the basket...and put big smiles on our faces. All that and his price was far less than I would expect. Cheers to his service, my sick friend brightened right up when I walked in with his pretty basket. YES!!</review><gmapID>0x80dc720e3cd17445:0x138f0c2d4b4eaf88< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I live out of state and my mom lives in CA, today was her birthday so I ordered online from Hey Flower Man! & let me just say, the online ordering process was flawless! I then called the store just to make sure that everything went through okay & the employee that answered (I didnt catch their name) was so nice and helpful and ensured me that they were already out for delivery and everything went through okay! I get a call from my mom tonight, literally yelling, because she was so surprised and absolutely loved the flowers & the mug/vase they came in! I will definitely recommend this place of business and use it as long as my mom is in CA! Thank you so much!< /Text>

I have never had such great, and personalized service from anyone!  I do not live in the area, and was so lucky to have called this flower store to deliver Mother's Day flowers to my elderly mom.  The owner's wife not only delivered a beautiful arrangement, but she took the time to bring it in and put it on the table for my mom.
I'm overwhelmed with this service and would highly recommend Hey Flower Man to anyone.

They have very fresh flowers and they were delivered within 3 hours of making the order. The prices are very reasonable. I would highly recommend this local Carlsbad florist!< /Review>

I ordered some flowers to be delivered for a birthday. There was a problem with order and the owner called the recipient to apologise and even offered to deliver new flowers, which I appreciate. I would recommend this flower shop.<//Text>

<rating>5</rating><text>Kim was not only a friendly and affable person, he knew how to rock a bouquet. I came to him at a pretty early weekday time (he opens early) and he totally knocked my order out of the park. I was staying in Carlsbad for my mother-in-law's birthday and Kim whipped up an order on very few specifications. Would recommend for anyone remotely close to the area with a need for excellent customer service and pretty flowers.<//text><pics>None</pics><Resp>{'time': 1522078090100, 'text': 'Thanks so much .I am happy you loved the flowers and our service .'}</Resp><GmapID>0x80dc720e3cd17445:0x138f0c2d4b4eaf88< /GmapID></record>

Called the flower man in Carlsbad and he did not disappoint whatsoever!! My wife could not be more happy with the custom arrangement of roses and Lily’s he made her! He was very easy to work with and I could not be more satisfied. I have used 1800 flowers and other large companies and it’s not even close to my buying experience with the flower man. A+!</review>

I've been getting my flowers from Hey Flower Man for over 10 years. They last the longest. My 84 year old mother loves the "Stargazers." They smell so good. Thanks again Kim.<//review>

<text>I ordered flowers for my Mom and chose Hey Flower Man! as she lives in Carlsbad and I was hoping for something really special. I live far away and can't see my Mom as much as I'd like. I was horrified when my Mom sent me a photo of the flowers to say thank you - I had never seen such a sad bouquet in my life! I called the store to tell them, since it says ON YOUR WEBSITE to do so if unsatisfied, and the OWNER ARGUED WITH ME! I don't care about your quality assurance practices when I pay $70 for a bouquet that looks like a 15 year old bought at the grocery store and threw in a vase. I'm SO sorry to be the ONLY person to complain about your 'most popular item', but if you had some business ethics, you would have helped me instead of belittling me. I am livid that I gave this business money, and that my wonderful mother has a garbage display of flowers for Mother's Day.

UPDATE: So, after my experience, I filed a complaint with the BBB. The next day, I received a text from my Mom showing a BEAUTIFUL bouquet, and chocolates, that had been delivered to her. Now THAT'S a $70 flower arrangement! Awhile later, I received a phone call from a man I'd never spoken to, that said HE was the owner of the shop and had heard about what happened. He was polite and apologetic, and explained to me that the manager I had spoken to previously was now on suspension. It was a nice resolution to the situation, and I hope the company continues to treat their customers with respect from now on :)</text>< time>

I'm very impressed with their service. My husband and I ordered last minute flower arrangements the day before our wedding....long story, and had them delivered to our venue on time. The flowers also looked beautiful as well.  Awesome company.</text>

<Review>Kim the owner is the best. He took the time to help me select the sympathy arrangement, changed the flower colors to reflect a more masculine look and made sure the florist in the (out of state, small town where they would be delivered) was reputable and competent. He also made sure he had the correct spelling of all the recipients names as well as the senders. It felt like I was talking to a friend, instead of a business. I'm so grateful I found him and definitely will be use him again.<//Review>< Pics>

<text>Fresh, but small bouquet.  I ordered flowers for my Mom for Mother's Day.  This looked like a good spot due to proximity.  I ordered and paid $15 for delivery the day before Mother's Day (they are less than 5 miles away).  My sister saw the bouquet and comment on it's (small) size.  She sent me a photo and it is not worth the price that I paid at all.  I sent an email to this business but haven't had the courtesy of a reply.  I'm ordering more flowers today and I will try another place.<//text>< pictures>

My wife and I live in Montreal, Canada. Needless to say, we can only visit my 97 year young mother occasionally. On very special occasions like her birthday, we use Hey Flower Man.

Each and every time, the flower arrangement, the vase, delivery and the ordering process has been absolutely perfect.  But the best part is that my Mom is absolutely delighted with the flowers that last for a long time!

Thus, if you are wondering about Hey Flower Man in Carlsbad, trust them. They do an outstanding job.

Never a bad bouquet! I buy flowers for my wife from Hey Flower Man because it is right by my office in downtown Carlsbad. She is always very happy with the look and smell of the arrangements. It has been years that I have been buying from Him, and it will be many more in the future.</review>

Great park to hangout, play with friends and family, and enjoy the beautiful waterview. I recommend this park to families with young kids who have an eager in sports, athletics, or other "sporty" recreations. I also recommend this place for energetic dogs who have fun running and are occupational most of the time. Great work!<//review>

<Text>Gull Park is a wonderful place to bring your family, friends and pets. Plenty of greenery for picnics or playing with your pet. Luckily, there a public restroom that's pretty clean and there is also plenty of street parking. The lagoon is very calming and refreshing to just gaze over the water.<//Text><Date>1491338687125< /Date><gmapID>0x808f9933e0693219:0x2457bcceb160a8c6< /gmapID>< Resp>

A grassy area with some trees and a beach. There was someone swimming in the water when I visited. Park benches are available. The grass servers as food for many geese who fertilize it generously, so watch out when running barefoot.<//text>

Quiet excellent, this was my first time in a DXL and I have to say it was very pleasant. For a long time I had trouble finding proper fitting clothes at stores such as JC Penny and Macy's. The salesman David was very helpful in showing me around the store and  assisting me till purchase. The Rest of the staff was also very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend it for my fellow bros out there are as big and tall as myself.<//Text>

This store has the best customer service! Everytime my boyfriend comes here to buy clothes the staff are so helpful. They make sure you leave looking and feeling great in your new clothes. Definitely the best store for men, plus it smells amazing... I love the scent inside the store.</Text>

<review>Manager Fred is amazing! He takes his time with my boyfriend each and every single time we go. He assisted him with getting a suit and getting it tailored as well. We had little issues with some shirts we bought and he went far and beyond to help us out himself. I really love how dedicated he is to making our experience excellent each time we go. We love DXL and their customer service at this store!<//review><user>108238003186011290134<//user><rating>5< /rating><gmapID>0x80c2ce538bd75ac1:0x7bec506f80220fc</gmapID>< Name>

<text>I'm a returning customer, (these guys took care of me while back) so I decided to try their new Mail-In service. It is FAST. They were able to resolve the issue with my DJI Mavic Pro Platinum in only 4 DAYS! C'mon! You can't beat that! My drone came back nicely packed in a priority mail box with a signature conformation. Loved it! Good luck finding anybody else that offers service just as quick! DJI doesn't even do that. Highly recommend!< /text><Rating>5< /Rating><GmapID>0x80c297cfcf1fbcad:0x53194d4dd6162201<//GmapID>< username>

It was very important for us to find fast and reliable drone repair center and so lucky after online research we found this drone repair shop in Sherman Oaks. The service was very fast both times. The first time we got an issue with Mavic pro gimbal camera and it was fixed in same day, about our second visit it was for dji inspire with remote connection problem. This guys work fast and will be back again if we need any other drone support and repair. We’re so happy with all services they provide. They have very reasonable  prices. Highly recommend.</review>< Pictures>

I recommend itech for any repairs you need on laptops, cameras, drones etc. Their are very knowledgeable and they know how to save you a buck.  The first time I came in with my DJI mavic pro (drone). I had crashed it at approx 20ft altitude so you can imagine the damage I thought it had.  The tech opened my drone up and literally told me what was bad and how much it'll cost me within 5 min. ( broken camera w/gimbal and rear arm w/motor ). The best part was that he fixed it and had it running that same day for me and the price was very reasonable.  Today is my second time in here. Again, I crashed my drone. Smh.
The dedication he puts into his work is amazing. Im completely satisfied with itech ifix.<//review>

< Review>
My DJI Mavic Pro was experiencing issues with the gimbal and brought it here to repair. The owner was a really nice guy and said it would be done in about 45 minutes.
He did a great a job and the drone flies perfectly. He also found some pressure cracks on the drone and also repaired them with no extra charge.
I thought the price was fair and is way cheaper and less of a hassle than sending it back to DJI.

This place is definitely my go to if I ever need drone repair again.
Thank you!!<//Review>

I had an issue with my drone and wanted to ship it to them. They first wanted to see if they can help me remotely and bu doing that save me the cost of shipping and possible repair. Indeed it was an issue that was resolved over a few emails thus saving me extra cost of shipping and repair and more important my drone was flying again in no time. I would highly recommend them, very responsive and professional.</review>

<GmapID>0x80c297cfcf1fbcad:0x53194d4dd6162201< /GmapID><text>Crashed my DJI Spark and was told by the dealer to basically buy a new one cause cost would have been same to fix it. I didn't accept that answer and started to look around. Came across this place and decided to leave my Spark with him for a diagnosis. Not only was this guy able to fix my Spark, but also at far less cost than the dealer. This guy knows his stuff and is more than fair with his pricing. I drove over 40 miles to get to this guy, well worth the drive but he also accepts mail in's and can also mail your drone back to you if more convenient. So if you want someone who knows what they're doing and will save you money on drone repairs, this is your guy.< /text>< pictures>

This business is closed. The drone repair ask you to send your drone in. They then give you a prepaid label that have you send the drone to a UPS locker. The excuses the use for why you have to send it in is because of Covid. After contacting them a few times they stop responding.</Review>

<Text>We crashed our drone late on a Saturday afternoon shoot. This was particularly upsetting because I had several shoots lined up the following week and just about every repair shop was closed the weekend. We found this spot an hour before closing, and booked it over. Not only did he happily take the drone right away, he completely fixed it within an hour, and still spent a decent amount of time with us helping us understand the drone better so it wouldn’t happen again. This is clearly a guy who really cares about his customers. He saved my drone AND my upcoming gigs!<//Text><name>Justin Phillip</name><user>101328358369879221702</user></record></dataset><record>

I contacted The Drone Repair company and made an appointment to bring my drone in to be fixed. Within 30 mins. of leaving the shop on Van Nuys Blvd, I got a call and a fair price quote to begin servicing my drone. I went to lunch as I was told it would be ready, same day !!!
Just under 2 hours later, I was given another call stating that my drone was ready! I walked in and Ludwig was testing my drone before my very eyes, showing it fully operational, repaired, calibrated and ready. WOW. Great repair shop, highly recommended. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐< /Review>

Ludwig is a real professional, he turned around our repair in one day and at a very reasonable rate. We chose to ship across the country from NY instead of using a local repair shop, because these guys are that great. Keep up the good work and thanks so much!<//Review>

These guys did an incredible job, we dropped of one of our many commercial drone platforms and the turn around was amazing.. problem was resolved quickly, and we made our next project date without any issues. I’d highly recommend these guys to all my colleagues within the Industry.

You’re in good hands, don’t send your off the shelf drones back to the manufacture for costly repairs...get it done here at a fraction of the cost and downtime.<//review>

Was having an issue with the gimbal on my mavic pro. The owner was really nice and helpful! Pricing is fair and better then sending to DJI which would’ve taken way longer to get back. His work also comes with a 3 month warranty. Definitely going back for all my drone needs.</review>

I drove out here to do business from Long Beach only to find out the business has closed. I called about 4 days ago and no one mentioned that they was closing their business. Website still says open. They call open answering phone calls.</Review>

I crashed my drone in Scotland and it damaged the lens. Drone repair fixed it in less than 2 hours and it works great. It wasn't expensive either. I highly recommend them.</text>

One of the Best Drone Repair Locations hands Down. Been to a few places prior and all gave me ridiculous prices and bad service.  I was referred here after my Mavic Pro was attacked by a bird. Drone was pretty busted up. After the FREE DIAGNOSTIC They gave me relief to hear my drone would be fine and at a great price at that. I would say I left the store 45 mins prior to getting my phone call telling me that my drone was ready to go. I have never received any service as great as this. Before you go anywhere else give them a call and I can guarantee they will take care of you, Cheers.< /Text>

Cannot recommend this service highly enough! I came in with a DJI Mavic Pro that had the gimbal base plate and ribbons break loose in an unfortunate crash.
Ludwig took the drone and started work almost immediately, giving me a very modest cost estimate and saying he would try to fix it in the next hour.
One ramen lunch later and I came back to find Ludwig outside test-flying my drone which was in perfect working order! He even said for me to fly it over the next few days and please let him know if everything was working alright.

1 million percent recommended for any drone repair needs!!</Text>

<review>This drone repair shop is an excellent resource for both professionals and hobbyist alike. If one has a system failure on their drone that cannot be easily remedied, this is your place. The flat ribbon cable which extends from the back of the camera and up to the mother board was torn. I ordered a replacement cable on amazon and attempted the repair. Damage to this cable is a common problem. Therefore, there are plenty of videos demonstrating how to fix the issue in a step by step fashion. Many of these videos contain a disclaimer that the repair can be challenging. I am generally all for learning how to fix things on one's own, however, this particular repair involves removing extremely delicate components essential to overall drone functionality. Further, the various screws and cable interfaces seem to grow infinitesimally small as you progress! The most challenging step of this repair is folding the ribbon cable and threading it correctly on the gimbal assembly. It's oragami from hell! This was a maddening experience for me. If you want to learn how complex the Mavic Pro is or if you are skilled working with practically invisible parts and peices by all means proceed with the DIY repair. If you're in the least bit reluctant spare yourself the agony and get the drone fixed by professionals.

I explained the issue that I had with the drone over the phone with the shop owner Ludwig. He gave me an approximate estimate but insisted that it had to be inspected. I finally went in to get a diagnosis and the final quote was square in the middle of the initial estimate. I think it's a fair price given how frustrating the job can be. I brought the drone in on a Friday at 2pm and the entire repair was completed within an hour. I wouldn't anticipate such a rapid fix as every job is different, but it seems that fast turnaround is one of the major benefits of coming here.

I brought my drone home on Friday and performed a basic flight test after updating the firmware. The drone was drifting a bit and so I called up the shop. Ludwig suggested that I calibrate the compass (I think he told me to do so when I picked it up). Alas, my Mavic is flying like a dream and I am a happy man. If you're a DJI owner in the Los Angeles area you're very fortunate to have this shop as a resource. I will be coming here for any future needs.</review>< pictures>

<Date>1557066382369< /Date><Review>(Translated by Google) During his stay in Los Angeles, it became necessary to repair Mavic Pro. We chose this workshop by the number of positive reviews and were not mistaken. Previously phoned, they brought a drone for diagnosis. The owner, pleasant to talk to, called me back half an hour later, called the cause of the breakdown and the low cost of repairs that had been arranged for us. About an hour later, we took our Mavic. Ludwig showed it in a short flight, warning that on arrival home it would be necessary to calibrate the compass and suspension. Satisfied with work and service. Recommend!!! Professional and friendly, have a good knowledge about drones. Very quickly! I'm very satisfied !!!

Во время пребывания в Лос-Анджелесе возникла необходимость в ремонте Mavic Pro. Выбрали эту мастерскую по количеству положительных отзывов и не ошиблись. Предварительно созвонившись, привезли дрон на диагностику. Хозяин, приятный в общении, через полчаса перезвонил, назвал причину поломки и невысокую стоимость ремонта, которая нас устроила. Примерно через час мы уже забирали наш Mavic. Ludwig продемонстрировал его в коротком полете, предупредив, что по приезду домой надо будет откалибровать компас и подвес. Довольны работой и  обслуживанием. Рекомендую!!! Professional and friendly, have a good knowledge about drones. Very quickly! I'm very satisfied!!!< /Review></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
This Salvation Army is an anti-black organization (black people beware). I have experienced several incidents of microaggression from the staff as well as random members on different occasions during a three month span.

The manager is a refined suspect racist who subtly defended an employees microaggression as the unrefined suspect racist employee followed us around the facility and monitored our usage of the amenities, oddly she did not follow other non-white members around the facility.

The Salvation Army reminds me of H&M and Starbucks. These types of institutions want black dollars but do not want anything to do with the black people who possess those black dollars. I suggest directing your black dollars to organizations that do not support service with overt or covert racist undertones or beliefs.<//Review>

We are renovating 2 bathrooms and so have shopped numerous times at the Floor and Decor on Delta Shores in Sacramento. Earlier this week we had an appointment with Lee, one of the designers and she was just amazing! My husband and I have different style preferences and she navigated thru it beautifully.  She kept suggesting different options until we came up with a workable...and beautiful selection we could agree upon. She was extremely patient with no sign of frustration even though we went over our appointment time.  Honestly I think that was one of the best customer service experiences I have ever had.  In general all the staff at this location have always been helpful and friendly.  I’m looking forward now to my new bathroom!! Thank you Lee :)< /text>

We have bought loads and loads of tile from Floor and Decor for our new house.  The selection is excellent, and the employees are helpful and knowledgeable. We have been helped several times by Julius, who is extremely kind and helpful and recognizes me even with my mask because I've been in so often<//review>

Everyone was extremely helpful. The young lady at the front counter was awesome at customer service, the loader was polite and efficient and helpful, and the young lady at will call in the back went and asked a couple of extra questions for me so I could try and find some things inside the store. Overall a great experience!</review>

Very attentive staff! I never had to ask for help on the floor, they come around and check in on you and take their time answering all of your questions! They tile is surprisingly decently priced as well. Wish they had more stores spread out the bay area!<//Text>

Our 1st time coming to find our Bamboo Floorig for our bedroom and from the moment we walked in the door it was fabulous.We were helped by the Assistant Manager, Vanessa, she was so helpful and friendly, definitely made our day and finding what we wanted was the best as we drove from Windsor, Ca. Definitely will be back to remodel the rest of our home.</text>

This is by far the best place for inspiration and selection of Tiles, Marble, Natural Stone laminate and all the other type of finishing product to finish a remodel in your home. As a contractor with FIX IT SERVICE'S GC D.B.A FIX IT PLUMBING this is my go-to place.<//Text>

Sat there for 1 hour. The stocking guy helped us find a book to look for what we wanted and said he would call someone over to help us. No 1 ever came! So we're gonna find a more friendly place to buy our vanity.</text>

<review>I started to remodel my bathroom. For the most part I shop at Home Depot. And for this project I started at Home Depot but last Sunday went to Floor and Decor.  I have very limited time so walked around real quick and found what I needed talked to one of the sales person great help and left . From Sunday till today I have went there 3 times. I am a home owner and just trying to do this myself. The people at Floor and Decor are very  helpful and they do want to help not just doing their job. Last night I went there and after waiting for some time (just before they were closing) a lady forgot her name came to help me . She did everything possible to help me . Even showing me some other options I might have to do what I wanted to . At the same time making sure that I don’t to over spent on thinks that I don’t really need . She was awesome. I for sure have more shopping to do there. Thanks for everyone there ppl at the front counter and ppl that help me plus other store employees. Definitely the store and the employees are there to help you. Great job</review>< Pictures>

This place is heaven if you like tile. It is HUGE and everything is gleaming and beautiful. I do a lot of shopping online but WOW! This place is something. It is as big as a COSTCO and filled to the brim with tile and flooring options. They have customer pick-up in the back which is super convenient if you do decide to shop via their website and if they do not have enough in stick, they can deliver. Honestly though, I cannot wait for COVID to clear up so I can spend hours wandering through their store in Sacramento. If you need help finding things or coordinating tiles, they have designers willing to help. The lady who helped me was very knowledgeable of the stock and provided a number of great options and coordinating styles of tile to complement our current design.</Text>

Was very pleased with the selection and service at the Delta Shores location.  I needed help carrying boxes of marble out to my car and also going through some of the boxes in the store and Gage was extremely helpful and lifted everything for me with a smile!  Will definitely shop there again!</Review>

If you go during the day you’ll definitely be asked if you’ve been helped a couple of times. They’re awesome. If you go close to closing it’s a bit harder to find help but when you do find someone they’re always willing to help. Sometimes they help you while they see you loading your car in the parking lot. They’re awesome all around.< /review>

Had an issue with a product I bought, tried to get it resolved but the manager Jamie looked me in the face and called me a liar! I never lost my temper with her but she sure did. She yelled at me in front of several people when clearly I was in the right. I had to drive 1.5 hours to the Roseville store to prove I was right about everything I was saying. I requested an apology from Jamie and she has refused. She would rather keep her pride in tact than have any sense of customer service. She let her emotions get the best of her and anyone should beware of this store. Good to shop at but lord help you if you ever have an issue with their products. You will get the rath of Jamie and you will be swept under the rug like you dont matter.
-out
Update: over a month later and still no response from the manager who called me a liar to me face in front of employees and customers even tho I was right. Guess they don't care like they claim to.</review>

The cashier helped the customer infornt of me, then that cashier started talking with other cashier. After 1min that cashier didnt even bothered to say im closed. He just looks at me and walked away. Customer service is poor. Never going to that stpre located in delta shores.</Review>< Pictures>

<review>I was able to order a hard to find lung health supplement.  When it ordered, it was shipped right away.  I had no hassles with this company.  I'm glad I was able to find this supplement.  I didn't think anyone sold it anymore.  I plan to continue to do business with HerbsPro.</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Received items on Nov 21, 20.

Used shampoo found out all 4 bottles of shampoo contained unknown shampoo. Spoke to customer service received return label on Nov 30, 20. No explanation about giving me counterfeit shampoos.
I was told that all their items are genuine.

Herbspro sent me an email says “ Received returned item, will refund my money in 7 business days on Dec 8,20.

Herbspro customer service replied to my inquiry that they “ have issued full refund “ On Jan 2, 21.

Herbspro customer service replied to my inquiry, they cannot issue refund due to their “technical glitch “ and “ just wait for my refund “ on Jan 7, 21.
I filed dispute transaction to my credit card company and submitted all correspond emails, proof of shipped back items, I received temporary refund from my credit company on Jan 8, 21.

Herbspro’s refund showed up on my statement on Jan 11, 21.

My favorite shampoo’s color * Alba Shampoo is clear and smell like coconut. Whatever shampoo they sent me had white color and did not smell like coconut, although they put effort on using genuine bottles.
Checked a seal of a shampoo for my pet, as soon as I removed the cap, seal came off with it. I couldn’t trust this company so I sent them all back to them.

As a consumer, shopping experience with Herbspro was just a nightmare.<//Review><UserId.>103305105235273883123<//UserId.>< resp>

<Text>Fast shipping is a plus! Competitive pricing is another.
However, the website offered a Free Shipping deal that didn't get applied when I went to check out, so I sent an email, and then the Free Shipping deal was removed from the website.
I guess that's responsive customer service?
Emails soliciting a 5-star review also leave me a little cool.</Text><Resp>None< /Resp><rate>4</rate>< userid>

<review>Terrible at delivery timing.  Way off by two weeks! Also they substitute brand names.  I ordered one product from a particular company and got similar product by another company instead.  Not what I originally purchased.  They should advise consumer when changing out brand names.<//review>< pics>

Perfectly sized small enough to fit in between burners on my stove top.  And, still adequately sized to store any left over grease I have.  Stainless steel is an added positive for easy cleaning in dishwasher or by hand.  I'm totally satisfied that it was a smart purchase.</Text>

On time delivery.  Purchased breakable products, none were damaged. But, as with many vendors, the packaging was excessively protective.   From bubble wrap around the product, to bubble wrap around the bubble wrap to tape making it impossible to open. DO NOT MISUNDERSTAND ME, I am thrilled to receive undamaged product, but flip when it takes me 20-30 minutes to open the packaging. The product was perfect.</Review>

At one point I even emailed them to see if I could get an update and got no answer! No response at all! I thought for sure I had gotten ripped off. Then randomly, weeks later this package appears. Exactly as ordered and with receipt. I don’t know if this is their normal process but it would deter me from purchasing again.<//Text>< date>

Placed an order which was summarily cancelled a month later but not refunded. No response despite repeated inquiries. If you place an order use a credit card because you’ll have to file a claim.

EDIT: since leaving my initial review above, i received a direct phone call. Apparently my interaction with them occurred during a technology platform change. I was also assured a refund had been issued though I have yet to receive it. I was asked if I could delete or modify my review. Let’s see: I didn’t receive product or a refund 6 weeks after my order, there’s apparently no trace of my last email but my google review is worth a phone call? Now that’s spunk!

So while these folks clearly have some technology issues I do understand it’s just some people hustling to make a living. I hope everyone else has a better experience. As goes with any merchant, caveat emptor.

And now that I’ve spent more time than the order was worth updating this review, I can’t justify improving the rating beyond what you see here now.</text>

Yes! 5 stars. Order processing/delivery in a timely manner even though I am on the opposite coast.  I haven't used product yet but I am happy with what I received.  Pricing is very reasonable. This is my first time purchasing from HerbsPro and I am sure it won't be the last. Large variety of essenses as well. Used lighter for scale.</text>

Ordering was easy. Variety of products available and some that are difficult to get elsewhere. Product arrived packaged well and in good condition. Taste and quality are good. Only complaint is the length of time to get the products. Ordered on 12/30/20, didn't ship until 1/19/21, and I finally received on 1/26/21. I expected quicker delivery on a product that was in stock.</Text>

HerbsPro had the best price and actually had the item in stock.  Shipping was somewhat prolonged.  The item is exactly as advertised and works better than the old one.  I'm a happy camper.<//Text>

<Review>The prices at HerbsPro can not be beaten!
I also like that they shipped my ointment in a box and even taped the ends.  Other companies have sent other ointments in an envelope and needless to say, some of the tubes had cream oozing out of them upon opening.  HerbsPro is a cut above!</Review>< pictures>

I love the nasal inhaler that I’ve been using for about a year. It clears my head and even allows me to settle down at bedtime and fall asleep in a short amount of time. It’s safer than any sleeping item on the market.< /review>

<review>I would give Herbspro a -10 if possible.  I ordered  a pain relieving cream ($26.00) and I received a feminine product that came open and spilled during shipment.  1st I emailed them and got no response. Then I called them, and even though I had an order confirmation of what I ordered, their "customer service " rep repeatedly argued with me that I got what I ordered.  So I sent them a copy of the order confirmation with another email.  Their response was "thank you for confirmation of receiving your order".  BUYER BE WARE!!!!!!!!! just throw your money in the trash can because that's what you will be doing if you buy from this place!</review><user_name>sharon mcdaniel<//user_name><rate>1<//rate><gmapID>0x808f95775d36653b:0xa30a9f369c26d16c</gmapID><pics>None< /pics></record>

<Text>1. Shipping my 6 bottles of gingko biloba took SEVERAL weeks.
2.  I rec'd an emailed customer service satisfaction survey, but I instead wrote to Customer Service letting the company know I couldn't give them a high RATING on the survey, due to slow shipping.  Nobody responded.
3.  One of the capsules in one of the bottles was empty, and it's contents had covered all of the other capsules with powder--so I called Customer Service to request an exchange.
4.  I had a hard time with the rep, who didn't allow me to speak with a supervisor but said, "Our shipping department will send you a return shipping label."  However, I do not have faith I will get a replacement bottle.
5.  If all goes well, I'll edit this review to reflect having had a better overall experience.< /Text><userid>107270770908427589566<//userid>< resp>

< Review>
I got everything I ordered; my only complaint - a minor one, really - is that it was shipped by USPS parcel select, which is very slow.  Also, the package did not show up on my USPS Informed Delivery page, which is supposed to notify me whenever mail is delivered.  It was just dumb luck that my caretaker came over the day the package was left in my mailbox (I am disabled and cannot get out to the street where the mailbox is).  Had it sat there a day or longer, in this high crime, drug dealing neighborhood I have to live in, it would have been stolen.<//Review>

<Text>Great experience with this company!  They fulfilled everything they offered;
my item at best price in comparison to others (I ordered DiaresQ which I had difficulty finding at a reasonable price.  I learned about it from Dr. Oz and it's a great product for a natural heal for food poisonings that cause diarreah ) and quick delivery!  I will order from them again.  Thank you!</Text><pics>None<//pics><response>{'time': 1618349715769, 'text': "Hello Belinda ,Thank you so much for your awesome review. It's so great to hear you enjoyed your experience with us.

I finally received the order after one month and after going to the website to inquire why it was late. I had never received even a confirmation email and yet the cost was listed as pending on my CC. later, the pending disappeared altogether confusing me as I wasn't charged. thats when I went to the site to see whats going on and finally it was sent. No, I'm sorry I can't recommend this business. I thank the online worker who finally got my order to me though. She was smart!<//text>

Salicylic bandaids I needed for my daughter were hard to find.  Glad HerbsPro carried them.  Order took 9 business days to arrive, so wish they could have processed a little more quickly,.  Tracking showed the package didn’t arrive at the transport facility until 5 days after order was submitted.  That’s the only reason I took a star off.<//Review>

If you are looking to get your product in a timely manner, I would move onto another company. In today's  online selling and shipping this was a long long wait for the product to even be shipped, when they said it shipped, 10 days later,  it still took 7 days to get from CA to OR. While waiting, I tried to cancel the order, which I believe moved them to ship it, I ordered from another company and received Puritian's order within days and it comes from back east. Prices are also a little higher at HerbsPro than other online vitamin stores. So in the long run, I would recommend you shop around before buying from HerbsPro. The product I purchased was as described.</review>

I ordered a product and they sent me the wrong brand - a product that sounds similar but is in fact entirely different - and it took several weeks to arrive. When I rechecked their website, they have the wrong image next to the product. I wrote an email to their support team asking how I could remedy this, and two days later got an email thanking me for confirming receipt of my order and asking me to give a positive review. So here I am - I plan on calling them to try to rectify this.< /Text>

My order took a long time and initially for almost two weeks when I logged in it said I had no orders placed which concerned me. Customer service chats did promise the order existed. I received my order several weeks later from the time of ordering and one of my items did leak in the box covering other items. Not sure if I will shop here again because I’m not overly impressed.<//review>

Bad experience.   Paid for items shown as "in stock" on their web site.  Over $50 worth of bar soaps.  They actually had none in stock, and they took a month to send me an email showing a refund.  The credit card still does not show the refund, so a dispute has been opened.  These people are to be avoided.  Ordered 12/12; Dispute opened 12/13;  Notice of cancellation from HP: 12/18/20;  Notice of refund from HP: 1/13/21; Dispute closed by bank in our favor:  2/12/21.  This whole exercise took two months.  No items ever shipped.  No resolution necessary, as order was cancelled and resolved by credit card company.<//Review>

It took awhile to get to me but this is the absolute best price for this tea. I love how it makes your skin smooth and hair grow. Take it with vitamin c for optimal benefit. I wish they had automatic monthly delivery.< /Text>

<Review>They sent me a fake tracking number 3 weeks AFTER I paid for the item, I wrote them 3 times asking what the proper tracking was, who it was shipped with. I waited 2 weeks for a reply to these 3 emails and nothing. I had to wait for eBay to refund my money and they wouldn't until we went through the full dispute process which was another two weeks, then it took 4 days for the cash to go back into my account. So it was almost 9 weeks total from the time they took my money, to when I was able to get a refund. The seller completely ignored my messages and the ones from eBay customer service. Don't order from here! They have gone downhill! Amazon has even shut them down on their platform for fraudulent activities.</Review>< rate>

It took them 2 weeks to deliver. They did not tell you how long or when it would be delivered like Amazon does when you place the order. I also found out that it was an item that I could pick up for $2 less. Doesnt sound like much but the item only cost $5. $2 is worth it ben delivered and not having to get out in the Covid world but the 2 weeks is not acceptable.<//review>

I won't buy again. HerbsPro is an outfit that masquerades as an American company. I ordered boxes of tea that my local market ceased carrying. How absurd that the international carrier DHL sent these tiny tea boxes, first to the other side of the country, then domestic mail to a sorting location, then to me. Minimize your carbon footprint! Do without,  is my lesson learned.<//text>

<Resp>None< /Resp><Review>My order history is really two orders. The first one took over a month to get to me and then ALL of the glass bottles inside were broken. This would mean 1 star, or zero if possible. The response to that order was then really great. I received the replacement order in 4 days and all glass bottles were in perfect shape. Hopefully, that is the standard by which HerbsPro operates. Time will tell. When the item is needed again, I will probably give them one more chance.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><user_id>101614903708200069611< /user_id>< Date>

<Review>The absolute WORST online shopping experience of my life. They charge your card immediately even though they do not ship for days/weeks. They do not answer the phone and would not respond to emails until I threaten to cancel the order. Stay clear of these people</Review>< pics>

While placing an order, which was supposed to be shipped for free, it automatically changed the shipping to priority mail, $37.00 for shipping on a $50 order, without giving me any option to stop the charge process.  How fraudulent is that!  I sent several full cancellation emails and phone messages for a full refund.  We’ll see if that works.  Also filling dispute charge with Visa.  What a rip off!</review>

I ordered 4 bottles of product and when I received them, the tops had been cracked and each bottle was leaking from the cracks.  It was clearly damaged in shipping, but I also noticed there was little packing in the box.  Suchetta took my call and we discussed  what needed to be done.  She was so helpful and professional.  I appreciate her willingness to help my with this problem.  Her attitude and helpfulness was outstanding.<//review>

Reviewing their customer service, not necessarily their products. I placed an order and was sent a confirmation email but there was no way to check on the status of the order without calling the company (as I did not create an account before purchasing). Nor did they answer my two emails asking for an update on shipping. Called 2 weeks after ordering and was informed that my order "should ship in the next 1 to 2 days". 8 days later, no update yet. I will call again and I understand that shipping times are longer than usual, I just would like to be kept in the loop as far as order status and feel that emails/online inquiries should be answered.<//review>

This is a total scam company, I placed an order 11/17, never heard a thing so I called the first week of December and spoke to a rather unpleasant man  who told me my order would go out tomorrow and then hung up! So rude! Then the next day I received FOUR emails from them stating the order was cancelled and to go to the website and reorder!  I called to find out why and nobody ever answered, so I went with another online company for my order. As of today 12/7 still no refund to my Paypal acct for the order from 11/17, called got the same RUDE man who stated refund would go through tomorrow! SURE it will......Opening a case with Paypal today.<//review>

Herbspro has an awesome range of products: supplements and vitamin that you need. Shipping might take a while depending on where you are, but that is understandable considering the situation nowadays. Their customer service is great as well, very helpful for follow-ups and inquiries. :)< /review>

Not even worth 1 star !!!

Your service was the worst of any online vendor we have ever dealt with.

You took over 2 weeks to deliver our order.

You shipped an incorrect item

Contacting your customer service by telephone was a horrifying experience, contacting by e-mail was no better.

You did not respond to any of our 4 telephone voice mails or 4 e-mails.

The correct item was finally received yesterday (took roughly a month).

We returned the incorrect item via USPS yesterday.

We will NEVER use your service again.< /Review>

HerbsPro has low-unbeatable prices for a vast variety of health products. After placing two orders on their website, I experienced over 10 days delay in shipping, and less than adequate Customer Service first-line responders. However, I got an exceptional support from the Customer Service manager, who turned my overall experience to be a positive one. (I was told the shipment delays were caused by the need to replenish out of stock products from their suppliers.)<//Text>

It is a very simple process to get you on the way to feeling like your 21 year old self again when you are really in your 40’s. Let’s get that libido pumping and testosterone level back up where it needs to be and most of all get rid of the stomach. Exercise time without feeling bad afterwards. Thanks Herbs pro I’ll be back next month.<//Review>< Pictures>

Hello HerbsPro,

My cardiologist advised me to get a blood pressure monitor and the nurses recommended Omron. I went to the nearby CVS and saw they were rather pricey so the pharmacist recommended I go online. When I saw your price, which is about  one-quarter of the one at CVS, I was skeptical. But I've received the monitor and used it for the first time today and everything seems to be in working order.

I hope it continues to give me good readings, and if I can afford my own personal CAT scan someday, I know where to go!

Best regards,

Jeff Barash<//text>

<text>The processing times seems long and they did not send all of my order.  I had to contact them to ask where the missing item was.  This could have easily been remedied by a simple email explaining that there were 2 packages or that they discovered the error and the missing item had been shipped. The quality of products are great.< /text>< user>

No answer to my questions about order in email, no tracking number.

I Treasure Herbspro. They have so many items I cannot find in the stores.  Over the Years I have dealt with them, there has been a couple of issues.  Broken cookies, when I reported it, the very gracious representative said to keep the broken chocolate cookies and use them to top ice cream. They shipped me new  ones. Then I received a lovely letter. THANKING me for being a good customer. Professionalism, Kindness, Incredible Stock and the idea of The Customer "Matters"  will keep me using this company.  It Just keeps getting better and better.< /review>

Great Customer Support During a Troubling time! My order had taken a bit to be shipped, but I was able to use their handy online chat feature. I had to wait a few minutes to get a live agent, but they promptly figured out the best solution for me. I give them credit for even staying open during such a lousy time but am thankful for them so that I could get my supplements.< /Review>

<Review>Ordered Nutricology Pancreas Grandular from the seller and received it within the stipulated delivery time. Seller is quite responsive to all the queries that I had as I was ordering from India. Would like to recommend HerbPro to others as the products they sell are all genuine and authentic.<//Review>< date>

<review>Amazing prices.  UPS delivered my order to the wrong address.  Initially HerbsPro was slow in responding to my queries, but eventually a very cordial HerbsPro rep called, evidently willing to do whatever it would have taken to solve the problem.  (In the meantime the person who received my package brought it to me.)

Recently, I came across HerbsPro while I was looking to purchase vitamins.  The price was great, so I thought I would give it a try. I definitely will give 5 Stars to HerbsPro and will continue purchasing from HerbsPro.  The entire experience is awesome, the customer services from Sucheta are superb (explain thoroughly, patiently, and honestly).  The products are great and the shipping is fast.  I have already recommending HerbsPro to my siblings.</review>

I am glad to mention these next few words in favor of Herbspro. They really care about service and quality. They also package everything really well and their delivery is always on time. Though I had an issue with my last order, upon request, they sent me a return shipping label along with a replacement product.
This is my favorite online health store. Your satisfaction is guaranteed here. They carry items that no other store on the internet does.</review>

I have had really good shopping experience with Herbspro. Their website is user friendly, their prices are amazing, they offer free shipping if your order is large enough, and they get your stuff to you very quickly.  I did have one order take longer than usual, but it was during the COVID-19 practical shut down, and all things considered, that went well also. They even emailed me to let me know they were swamped and my order would take longer than usual.  I would recommend them for sure!< /text>

Ordered something 12/13/19 and was told at time of order it would ship within 3-5 days.  I was charged for this order on 12/13/19.  1/8/2020 The order had still not shipped.  Called customer service held three times for 15+ minutes and each time got hung up on as they answered.  Called back and pressed one for placing an order instead of number 2 for customer service and low and behold they answered immediately.  I was told the order would ship in a few days.  When asked why it was charged for but not shipped....crickets.  I asked to cancel my order and he said canceled, anything else Mam?  I asked for a confirmation number and was quickly given one.  Hoping I will get my money refunded but I have my doubts.  DO NOT ORDER from this COMPANY!!!!</text>

Great company to buy my monthly stock of supplements. Everytime I order - seamless transaction, the products arrived in just a few days. Packed beautifully, and everything in the box was as it should be. I have found some items on their website that no one else carries. Herbspro is good!<//review>

I ordered some Whey protein powder through PayPal. after three weeks of getting no email confirmation, I called four times and each time after holding for several minutes, I was cut off. I sent two messages through their website and never received a reply. Out of frustration, I had to contact PayPal and request a refund.  I do not recommend HerbsPro.</review>

I do feel like this company does do whatever they can to have a satisfied customer. I appreciate the communication I received until my order was picked up.   This covid19 did cause a lot of trouble and delays, but they were very responsive and corrected an issue I had with a delivery to a wrong address. Thank you Herbpro for all you did.</review>

<time>1591132506332</time><Review>Edit: After leaving this review and a voicemail with the company I was promptly contacted by the head of customer service who graciously  addressed my issue and concerns. She updated me on the status of my order and moved to ship the available items from my order today while we wait for the other items to be fulfilled by the manufacturer. This is the kind of customer service I really appreciate!

Poor customer service team and communication. I understand shipping times are slow during these times, but have not received any communication about items I ordered being on backorder, nor has there been an attempt to ship items that are currently available in waiting. Online chat representative was completely unprofessional, unresponsive, and did not handle this issue with care. Trying to contact them to cancel my order and still unsuccessful. Would not attempt to order from them again—back to iHerb and Vitacost.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures></record>

I tried to place an order with Sucheta and she was very helpful.
However, Herbspro website and especially the order page was not functioning very well, and I could not place my order. My order placed was taking way too long to confirm. I would encourage the owners of this company to contact their IT Dept to fix this important problem. I almost cancelled my order, but Sucheta went out of her way to place my order for me - she was wonderful and extremely professional. I would recommend anyone who wants to place an order to ask for Sucheta! I look froward to receiving my order i hope in a timely manner.</Review>

<username>Joe Finley<//username><review>My shipment was taking a longer time due to the COVID 19 issues. I contacted HerbsPro by email listed on the initial email I received confirming my order. Within a day I received an email from Sucheta who informed me the product would ship the next day. Sucheta was correct.  Sucheta maintained contact with me through email to keep me informed as to the progress of my order. I was very appreciative of the communication I received and the product arrived as promised.</review>< rate>

Vicious criminals. Took money. Gave me a false tracking number from DHL. Lied about the shipping date. They don't answer the phone or e-mails. They were 3rd party sellers on Amazon-but not now. Amazon refunded my money. I hope they go under before they ripoff anyone else.</Text>

The product I have received over the past 5 years has been useful and until the last 2 orders quickly delivered. The last 2 orders have taken almost 3 weeks to be delivered even though it is in stock. I am not sure what has changed however when you are taking suppliments you do not want a gap so it is essential to know the amount of delivery time.</Review>

If you purchase, know they they appear to be a dropship outfit. Nothing in stock. Ergo lots of delay. Refunded.</review>

It took a whole month to receive my item, I wasn't even sure that I would ever get it. I sent an email after waiting 2 weeks for my purchase
to find out what was happening with my order and I never got a reply back. When I first placed my order I received an email stating that my order was processing. I then recieved an email the next day asking for a review, how can I review a company on anything if I just purchased from them a day before! I never got an email stating my item was ever shipped. I couldn't check my order on their site because they don't have any way for you to check your status. I wish I would have read all the negative reviews before purchasing from HerbsPro.</Review>

<text>Awful - Took 16 days to get my product and then when I did get it today, the plastic container was shattered into little broken pieces and the grooming wipes  for my dog are all dried out.  The package should have had bubble wrap around it.  Also, should not take 16 days to deliver.  Contacted them and told them I want a replacement or my $$ back.  He said he will send replacement.  We'll see if I ever get it.

UPDATE: Happy to report this vendor did in fact replace product free of charge.<//text>< pictures>

I never got an acknowledgement of my order and as soon as I called it was shipped right away.  Now for over 2 months I have been trying to get a copy of my order receipt.  I'll never use these people again.</Review>

< Review>
It take times to get a phone call from them. I have been waiting for my order for more than ten days and they didn't even update my order status!!! Luckily, they reached me shortly and solved my problem. Now I am waiting for my order coming. Hopefully, It will arrive on time.< /Review>

<text>I ordered a product on August 20.  They shipped it Aug. 23, 2016.  They said it would be delivered to me between August 26-31.  I never got it, so I emailed them.  They told me to wait another five days!!  It's been over five days, and I still have not received my order.  I cannot track it, and they refuse to do it for me or even give me an accurate tracking number.  Today is September 5, 2016, two weeks since they shipped it.  I now have to wait until tomorrow, since today is Labor Day and no mail.  Never again will I order from this company.</text>< username>

<Text>Not impressed.  Poor customer service.  I sent an e-mail to ask where my order was - no reply.  My order finally arrived 16 days after my credit card was charged - and it's missing an item.  There are other companies out there with much better service.<//Text>< Gmap_id>

<Review>The delivery took longer than expected so I contacted the company.  Sucheta from customer's service reached out to me to explain why and follow up with the carrier and since it showed that it was delivered, she called me to ask if I received and if it was ok.  I think that it is a good customer's service practice and thank her for reaching out to me.< /Review><Response>None</Response><userid>115931532255252575757</userid></record>

I didn't read the Google reviews before ordering.   :-(  Ordered on the 15th of the month.  Today is the 22nd and the one, small item I ordered STILL hasn't shipped.  Won't be ordering from this company ever again!</review>

<review>Ordered a product. Never received a confirmation email but was billed through PayPal. Called on day five after not receiving item and left voicemail. No one returned my call. Day 7 I call again and get the run around from a middle eastern call center that does not know what's going on nor can they find the order in the system. Finally find order and tell me it should be shipped out in the next couple of days. Guess I'll wait and see if it ever actually shows up...</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x808f95775d36653b:0xa30a9f369c26d16c</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

They deserve  (-)....but there is no such an option, so I put for them the lowest possible. This is, without any doubt, the worst company I run across last 20+years. They never answer phone calls, shipping from CA to AZ is one day with FedEx or USPS. They used DHL....and couldn't deliver for 10 (ten) days. When I called to order...there was an indian (from india) with broken English, hard to understand....I should got away at that point....I learned that lesson the hard way.</Review>

Horrible customer service.  Supposedly order was processed right away but I received no communication regarding shipping.  Had to push and was told that 3 of the items were not in stock​ but it should be shipped in two to three days.  Two weeks later I had to go onto the website to find out any information on the order and found that it had finally shipped but would take 12 days to get the product.  I will not order from this company in the future.</Text>
