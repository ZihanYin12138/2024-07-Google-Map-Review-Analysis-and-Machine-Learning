Ashley was the associate/mechanic to assist me she was very chill and did a fantastic job explaining their services. All the associates were attentive, polite and worked efficiently when maintaining the car. they got the entire car done within 15 minutes. And the manager inspected it before take off 10/10 service i will be returning for my next car maintenance.< /review>

DO NOT ACCEPT ANYTHING MORE THAN AN OIL CHANGE. See attached photos for proof.

Just laying out facts, and debating if I can take legal action:

My car has been 100% perfect up until I visited this location. Never had any problems beyond having to occasionally blow air into my tires.

1. Just moved to Oakland and looked for the nearest Jiffylube for an oil change
2. Jiffylube staff offered to clean my battery. Given it's covid, I figured they could use the extra cash so for the first time, I said okay.
3. They completely removed my battery and went to town spraying whatever fluids they have into my engine bay. Is Jiffylube supposed to completely remove the battery? I thought they were going to only wipe the discharge.
4. 2hours later they are finally done, but I am having trouble starting my car. The dashboard looks like a Christmas tree with all of the warnings lit up
5. They tell me to go to Pepboys down the street because their obd2 reader is not working and return tomorrow to speak to Jiffylube's manager, Mohamed
6. Pepboys mentioned that it is likely something wrong with the battery and that it may need to be replaced
7. I returned the next day to speak with Mohamed, who took a look and tried to avoid any blame. Leaving me to go figure it out on my own. This interaction added no value to me and was a waste of my time.
8. I go back to Pepboys. They tell me I need a new battery, and that I have the following obd2 codes: po560 & p0606
9. p0606 has to do with the Power Train Control Module and costs an additional $500-$1500 (based on google) to have replaced.

Overall, for a simple oil change, this specific location has cost me $500 so far with up to an additional $1500 to replace the PCM. As well as 5hours driving around and waiting for repairs.

My car is not the same. If you think I can take action - I could use some guidance. Otherwise, I might just make this a major learning lesson never to go to Jiffylube again.

Already spoke with Philip Arnold and that didn't prove to go anywhere. So I am cutting my losses and was referred to a trusted local auto mechanic to handle all of my car needs moving forward. cheaper too.

I will let you, the reviewer, figure out the quality of service here.<//Text>

These guys are terroristic!  They even tell you about discounts you are not aware of...now when did you encounter that kind of kindness last?
Plus, they constantly make you aware of what they are doing, and they have you in and out in a Jiffy, just like their sign says...I was so impressed with the service I tipped these hard working consciousness guys well.

They deserved every bit of my support.
Go here, because the training they received was very good and it shows, and I've been to many Jiffy lubes and I am sticking with these guys.<//review>

This young group of employees were great. They worked like they'd been working together for years. Come to find out most of em have only been there less then 6 months. So that was impressive and I was in and out in less then 15mins<//review>

There was one mechanic this Saturday when I went in. He, like the many times I frequent, was very professional. They had a "HELP WANTED" sign outside by the street, and he was very good at communicating to other customers that the wait would take about an hour since it was only him until another employee arrived about 30 minutes later. I was the first customer and was fine with the wait since I had my phone with me. I will continue to go here since they are knowledgeable in car safety.<//Review>

<Text>Wack - wasted over an hour at this jiffy lube this morningtrying to get my vehicle inspection done so that I can continue driving for Lyft. After being assured by one of the staff there that they could fix my burnt-out headlight fixture and give me a passing vehicle inspection, I was finally informed by a different, older staff member that they could not perform that fix for my headlight or give me a passing vehicle inspection. However, I gave them three stars instead of one star because the second, older jiffy lube employee did not charge me for the license plate light that he fixed.<//Text>< date>

I went to do my oil change and they forgot to put the oil cap. I heard a strong noise in the motor when I left the shop and I decided to go back otherwise I won't have a car right now. I know that accidents happen but base on the reviews for this location this is not the first time they forget to put the oil cap back.</Text>

Went to get my oil changed. They checked all my tires said they were all the same pressure. Got home and my light turned on to check the air pressure. When I checked they were all different pressure. I was missing a cap on the tire and another one was switched out for a different one. Never taking my car here again.<//Review>

<text>Heads up never go to Jiffy Lube in San Leandro, those Morons nearly destroyed my car. They forgot to put the oil cap back on my engine and broke the skid plate under my car, I noticed my car smelt of gas when I turned on the heat, and that my gas mileage was abysmal on my way down to Mexico, stopped at an AutoZone my oil had all boiled out and was empty, it was all over the engine compartment, and I have to order parts from the manufacturer to fix the skid plate that vibrates under the car and rattles if I go above 70.

I also noticed the blondish white kid with trashy facial hair came out of his personal car to a cloud of weed smoke. I thought nothing of this at the time but was reminded to put this in my review after reading another customer review that noted this behavior.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<review>I brought my brand new 2017 Pathfinder in for a routine oil change. Immediately afterwards the interior lighting in my vehicle stopped working. When calling to ask them to look at the fuses I was told that the only location that can do this is in Lafayette, which is almost 30 minutes away from where I live. They are closed today so I’ll have to wait until after New Year’s. Also, employees were smoking weed in their cars on their lunch break as I was waiting to pull into the garage which doesn’t really make your customers feel confident in having them work on your car. They must have had a filthy rag to “clean” my windows because they were completly streaky and a mess which I needed to re-clean myself at home. Don’t take your vehicle here- I should read the other reviews of this location.</review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>{'time': 1516131410130, 'text': "We are disheartened to learn of the inconveniences you've experienced, Mike, as this is certainly not something we want for our guests.

I have to agree with the other reviewers who say the service here is horrible.  They act entitled like you are interfering with their personal day rather than offering a service.

It probably is worth it to drive to a different location or a different company.

Too bad.<//Review>

<text>I needed a.rideshare vehicle inspection.  It was the most convenient location.  I arrived and was told they don't do that service when they have partnered with Uber to do so.  I was told my form was wrong anyways the same form I downliadex from UBERs website.  They don't  even stock the forms at any other jiffy lubes for that matter.  Utter crap for service.<//text>< Pics>

Not sure why it takes one hour to ch age the oil... I’ve been to other jiffy lubes and have them do it in 10-15 minutes while I’m in the car... why did this now over an hour and my car has been in the port the entire time.... ugh...</Review>

I came today for only an oil change about 5:45 pm but they refused to take my car. It looks 6 pm is not the official time they close at.
I usually get oil change at jiffy lube because I like their service but I don't know what to say about today.<//review>

I ordered online. Pizza was ready and hot when I got there. Good amount of topping. I wish the large pizza wasn't so small now 😭 it used to be a meal but they have to keep the price low. New employee was very nice and asked someone when she didn't have my answer. I love that!</Text>

<review>Large combo was not hot. Wings were not hot. Not enough sauce or cheese. Asked for hand tossed crust. Not sure what we got but not the hand tossed look or flavor I remembered. Infact the crust had an sweet odd aftertaste.  Dissapointing esp since we live only 3 blocks away. Won't be back.< /review>< resp>

<review>I was really hesitant to call and order for a pizza given the prior reviews but I'm glad I did. It was a pleasant experience from start to finish. The person on the phone was very nice, the order was completed quickly and when I arrived to pick up, all the employees were courteous and pleasant. Whatever problems this store may have had apparently is in the past. I will not hesitate to visit again. Thank you!</review>< date>

We were on a trip from out of town . We dined in and it felt as if the AC was not on making it extremly uncomfortable. The staff dropped the pizza off at the table and that was the last time we were serviced. We had to get napkins, cheese and drinks. We rate this a low 2 .</review>

It’s an ok place. Not such a great environment. I love Pizza Hut, it’s my favorite Pizza place besides Tary’s.  I’d rather drive to Merced’s Pizza Hut.<//review>

The pizza was hot and good just very poor service the driver forgot our soda and I called and spoke to a manager and she refused to make it right. They really need to learn about customer service.... Poor poor service</Text>

<text>If you order the same type of pizza repeatedly and they mess it up, its a stupid move. More so even after they messed up the first order, when you finally step out and try something new. To argue with a customer is not how a manager should behave. Need to be retrained. Its in your system of what we always order people. Will be reporting to someone above you.<//text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Really enjoyed dining here while visiting California. I know good food and there is truly good food here! Wish we were staying one more day, I would have gone again the next day too! Thank you for the Hawaiian shortbread cookies 😊</review>

You also get a lot of food for the money which is nice and service was very pleasant. My only complaint might be that the spam musubi to rice ratio was off. Way too much rice for the thinness of the spam slice. Beef teriyaki was a little over cooked, but chicken was delish and short rib cooked to perfection.</Text><user_name>David Cho< /user_name></record></dataset><record>

It's ok. The cabbage is boring. The macaroni is bland and warm, hardly any carrots...meat is so so. The inside is wearing out, no up keep. Dunno if they have new management but this place used to be great.<//Review>

When I walked up she was texting on her phone and didn’t look up until after almost  a minute of me standing in front of her. She also answered her cell phone in the middle of me ordering. She seemed bothered to be working too. Second, the food was NOT fresh and did not taste good. I got a Kahlua pork bowl and it mostly consisted of rice and cabbage. I also got a bbq chicken mini plate and spam musubi and the chicken was dry and no flavor. I will NOT be coming here again.

<username>Dean Clark<//username><time>1550442175479<//time><Rating>5<//Rating><Review>I love L & L Hawaiian bbq. Whenever I go to Oahu I always make sure to hit it, so I'm super happy that the chain has made it to the main land. The West Covina location is easy to find, and serves the same great food found in Hawaii. My favorite menu items are the Loco Moco, and Spam Musabi. I highly recommend it for great Hawaiian food, and super low prices.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

The food here is pretty good and consistent in how it is made or at least tastes. Which I personally like because you know it's gonna always taste the same. I can feed a family of 8 with 4 combos and still have some food left over. My family enjoys the katsu chicken, bbq chicken (more like teriyaki) kalua pork with cabbage (my personal favorite) their macaroni salad is super yummy too! My son also enjoys their spam musubi.

So typically for 4 combos I spend a lil less than $40 which is a win for feeding a family of 8 while going out to eat. The only draw back is the outdated decor and their lack of customer service. But by no means does that change their food. So we'll be back!<//text>

<review>They are all independently owned and operated, this one is just so so compared to others. Definitely not like those back home on the rock. But for simple stuff it will do. Loco moco, musubi selection is decent, get the Portuguese sausage musubi. Garlic shrimp is ok but now like shrimp trucks on North shore...I would say get the garlic mahi plate instead.< /review>< Response>

I found that the food was dry and not very flavorful, though I did get a lot of it. the left overs are still sitting in my fridge and will probably be thrown out.</text>< pictures>

I'm personally a big fan of their katsu, but bbq short ribs and spam misubis don't disappoint. Clean location, plenty of parking, and never too busy.<//text>< pics>

Ever since I was first taken to an L&L on O'ahu I've been a big fan, and now frequent one that is close to my home. This particular L&L doesn't hold a candle to the rest. Yes they have mostly the same menu, though some items have been covered over with white cardboard, nothing I ordered was of the same quality. The bbq chicken was fatty and some bites tasted fainty like balogna, the rice was mushy, and even the macaroni salad tasted off. I dont know if wasn't fresh or they failed to follow the recipe.  I also ordered steam vegetable which was mostly cabbage. I considered ordering katsu but when i saw there katsu sauce it was more red than brown and to me that said way to much ketchup. I probably should have realized it wasnt as good as the whole time i was there only myself and the two staff were present. If you are in the mood for hawaiian bbq this place is edible, maybe even ok to those who dont know any better, but if you do maybe keep driving.< /Review><Name>Mathew Mitchell</Name></record>

< Review>
The freshness of the chicken is something I have not had in a long time. Your quality of ingredients are beyond industry standards. Thanks for such a positive environment that you always give when your customers are speaking with you. I really appreciate I found a great place that provides us high quality food in the area that you are located.I would highly recommend this establishment. Just give them a try and I am sure you will not be disappointed. The young lady who works there is very kind, patient, and very thankful. So to you I thank you for your hard work and providing us the best chicken in the state of California in my opinion.< /Review>

<review>The chicken is 5 star but everything else its really not worth it. Its convenient store so there is mo place to sit down and eat. Make sure to call ahead of time and place order otherwise you will be waiting long for your fast food delivery. The sides we had Fries, biscuits and sweet corn all were terrible. I will eat the  chicken again but not go out of my way for it.</review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMuEAqN31ej-NlTTHT6Es92j140hg5wqEERaaDr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP5MoSLEzXTibqOqiUyifBYdXjrGwhHUyMAFVDv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPF_MsFuL5f6OYVrbf6CfSeZqp7kvKaQZL58mTh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOgNsKPBhSKD0bCXHVAF6Mmty4jvd9Xvy0dNuq8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOZI44YBjYVAKy4cT-urpzW_ahR74sHBva8-d8u=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNVLdnoJMLB3BEwqDymo88iPPz0vl22TlKQBBCn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPhNZIbB0f4ZaVmfRs0N40Zc3ghCagC_86sTql-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x80dd299e9b2d1105:0x135fb792185a2d94< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>The chicken tasted was good. However, the place is soo busy that ONE employee handling the front desk is NOT adequate.

In our case, Ali was handling our order, paying for it and answering other customers phone calls.

Furthermore, be AWARE, if you pay by credit card they will pay you some additional fees. The problem is NOT the fees, it is the fees are NOT disclosed anywhere on their website nor in the store. You just get charged without knowing until you see it on the receipt.

The worst part the cashier tells you the charges are based on what the bank charges them.

In short, we buy from this location as they provide HALAL chicken.

Note, Their website showed they have TWO locations. Good for them.<//Text>< rate>

<Text>I have never eaten such crunchy, juicy and big pieces of Halal fried chicken in California so far.  They should open up more outlets in other cities and offer more deals so that it's easier for us to give them more clients.good job guys!<//Text><Date>1579838173086< /Date><user>109161839200435197459< /user>< Rate>

<text>Good chicken. Nice breading, good selection of items, and not so greasy. The Buffalo sauce was to my liking: flavorful but not spicy enough that it repulsed me from eating more.

Very crispy fries, but did not seem to have much seasoning. A sprinkling of salt and they were perfect.

Price is a little high, though thankfully they also sell drinks for good prices.

Had to wait about 15 minutes. A bit longer than a typical meal from Teddy's next door, but Teddy's doesn't have fried chicken. This place could definitely use more staff at times. When I visited, one worker had double duty: operating the normal convenience store operations, and preparing the food for multiple people. Very polite worker though.</text></record>

I think I got overcharged. The receipt I got only gave me the total amount that I paid. I didn't receive an itemized receipt. I didn't get ketchup for my fries, napkins or utensils. They have a promo in store that is false advertisement. It was a combo with chicken tenders, biscuit and sauce. But they didn't have biscuits and they will not give u something else to replace it. I think I was missing 2 chicken strips. I think it was highway robbery even with the 5% discount what I paid was a lot.</Review>

Delicious fried chicken. I always ask for spicy and extra coated. I also get boneless wings and mashed potatoes. They are a hit or a miss sometimes. I like the coleslaw and don't really like biscuits. But stick to fried chicken you will not be sorry unlesa you are avoiding salt because they are cajun flavores which is salty. Order ahead because there is alwaya a wait time.< /review>

Good taste. Freshly cooked. I could have given this business 4 or 4.5 stars but the reason of giving 3 stars is time management. No respect for customer time. Takes too long to prepare order even you call them in advance to pick up order.<//text>

Truth be told the chicken and sides are 5 stars!
It’s so good. I really enjoy the strips and the regular chicken. The price point is amazing. However there is a woman who works there often who is just so rude I am no longer returning to this location. I’ve come here about 7 times now over the last 3 months and she has “helped” me 5 times. I don’t
Know if she hates her job, life or just the customers but she super rude to everyone. It’s unfortunate. If you’re in a pinch and don’t mind a run in with a rude worker it’s definitely worth it. Worth calling ahead if you do go. All the other workers are super kind and friendly.<//review>

I'm giving a 3 for overall experience (food and service). I purchased the 12 piece family meal and the 5 piece shrimp meal. I will breakdown each item as follows:

Chicken - Seasoned well. Taste was good.
Shrimp - Seasoned well. Taste was good.
Parmesan Lime Corn - Overall taste was just okay.
Macaroni and Cheese - Not Impressed.
Honey Biscuits - Good.

For the amount of time I spent waiting awkwardly for my meal (there isnt anywhere to sit)  to be completed I expected my food to be hot. It was lukewarm at best. The setup is basically a liquor/convenience store with a 711 type food set up. There is not a dedicated Krispy Krunch worker. So be prepared to wait as the cashier handles the liquor/convenience store customers in between taking your order. Oh and they also sell ice cream but it didn't look appealing since the majority looked like it was melted.

My recommendation would be to call before going in. I may order chicken and biscuits from them again but I'm cool on the sides.</review>

The best halal fried chicken ever!  Order for a party of 70 people and everyone loved it.  If you in the mood for some fried chicken, check this place out.. Much better than the kfc in my opinion.  The coleslaw and mac was excellent as well.</Text>

The biscuits are out of this world. the fact that it's usually attached to a gas station or convenience store makes beverages a breeze. Definitely worth trying don't be afraid of the location.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

I should have listened to the reviews and hadn’t gone to this place!!!!! Horrible service, slow and absolutely disgusting place. It’s sad because there are not a lot of halal places around us. So I had to drive far to get here.
I had to add to the post... I can’t believe it takes about an hour to take 16 piece chicken!!!! Omg I can’t believe this. They said to call next time. Really!? The ones who ordered had to wait about the same time.< /text>

Unfortunately this location doesn't seem to have a dedicated staff for the chicken, so it can be a bit of a long, awkward wait for your order to be made.

Chicken is no doubt amazing along with chicken strips!! But the biscuits they gave me were the worst biscuits I've ever had and fries as well were absolutely no good,  if you happen to go there just get the chicken and they did take along time with everything at least 30 mins wait,  better to call.< /text>

Came here expecting to get something similar to KFC but halal, and I was definitely not disappointed. Will come back here again but next time I will call and order ahead of time. Not the best tasting food in the world, but it satisfies my chicken cravings.

This is inside of a conveniece store, and so it can get quite busy for one cashier to handle the food and regular purchases.<//review>

Was very excited there was a Krispy Krunchy near my home! Unfortunately it was a big disappoinment to my kids & I, being that the biscuits were microwaved and not bakes so they taste NASTY!! And the portion of potatoe wedges given for a family meal deal equates to tge serving size of a 2pc single meal..smh
I would not recommend this location if you want a REAL Krispy Krunchy experience. I will never get chicken from here again.😷< /Text>

This small restaurant in downtown Oxnard has the best homemade tortillas I've ever tasted. I ordered the chilaquiles and the meal was served with beans and rice and two eggs on top. I mixed it all together and with the fresh corn tortillas it was Amazing.<//review>

Birria and Menudo is on point but my favorite thing here is the custom/special quesadilla. Amazing. It's a hole in the wall so dont expect something crazy but it's the kind of place that when you see the older ladies cooking in the back you know the food is bout to be fire!!< /Text>

The Carne tasted as if it was previously cooked and warmed in a microwave. Very greasy. Not worth the price at all. The meat in the hardshell tacos was undercooked and had cartilage in it. Very disappointed because I used to come here with my Mom when I was younger. Will not be coming back.< /Review>

<text>I’m sooo happy they are still around after the pandemic! I was counting down the days for them to reopen! They are so accommodating and such nice people. I had gone to a different pet wash that was able to be open throughout the pandemic but it did not compare to this facility. I love that they provide different shampoo options, brushes and towels. This place makes taking care of my ol girl so easy!< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

< Review>
i took my dog in and gave pictures for reference and when i came to pick up my dog the groomer said she was soo matted that they had no choice but to shave her. After they shaved her there was still matted hair which tells me they didn't even bother to brush out the hair and trim the coat like i wanted but just shaved her to save time that tells me that the groomer was lazy and didn't want to do the work

i will never be coming back to this place ever again!!!!!!!

take your pet to a groomer that actually listens to what you want

before and after pictures i wanted a trim and the shaving they did was not even clean i absolutely the worst grooming experience i've ever had<//Review>

This place is awesome.  I have a Rottweiler (who is the biggest baby) and as much as he hates bath time  he loves going to The Pet Wash. The staff is super friendly and helpful.  They provide shampoo, conditioner,  towels and brushes. It makes everything so easy. I am sooooo happy they are still around after the pandemic. I will be at the Pet Wash every week to help keep them in business  and my dog's skin issues in check.</review>

Been taking my dog here for a while. Last time I beought him they didnt rinse him good enough and he broke out in a rash with bumps all over, 3 days later he still has bumps. I put him in the bathtub at home and thoroughly rinsed him as soon as I noticed. I will not be returning to this place.< /review>

Wanted to schedule bath for my dog, the person on the phone wasn't very helpful, sounded kind of annoyed by all my questions. Went to another place instead which was also booked for 2 weeks but they sounded like they really need to have a new client.< /text>

Great! Just had to write a review!
My doggo arrived at LAX after a gruelling 18 hours in a crate - flying from Sydney to LA and he was "wet" - actually soaked!
I googled a local dog wash and finding these guys, was so impressed!!
Great service on the phone and even though they were about to close they said jump in a cab and come  over.
So good.
Now my pupper and I can fly on to Idaho!
Great service, really professional and fantastic with my doggo!
Thanks guys!<//review>

I usually use the do it yourself wash, but with Covid happening they are only taking drop offs. I was VERY worried because my very elderly dogs are sensitive and need a calm, kind hand.  Manuel was exactly that. He took his time and gave them great love and care, and they look beautiful and fresh after a long time without a grooming.  Thank you, Manuel, for taking such good care of my old babies <3</text>

This is the first time I brought my dog to the pet spot and I was really impressed.  One of the few times that my dog gets a cut evenly and thoroughly.   I will definitely be back without a doubt.</Text>

This place is great. One of my dogs is...difficult, and they never complain. Once I tried to do a self wash with her, spent 15 minutes, used al the jerky treats they gave me and got nowhere. When I went to pay they refused to charge me since it didn’t work out.</review>

This is an excellent place to take your dog! My dog Karma is so timid and anxious, but every time I take her to the pet wash I know that she'll be taken care of. All of the people that work here are so nice and the guy that works at the front desk Isaac always greets me with a smile and cheerful attitude. I will definitely continue coming here for the years to come and I suggest that you do the same!< /text>

<review>Small in the wall dog wash shop, and rough around the edges. The place is wonderful tho! I love how they give each customer enough towels when using the self wash, and my dogs always look forward to the treats they gift also! :) My dogs love coming to this dog wash. The only downside is I hope they can invest in upgrading and improving the soap dispenser system, and fix the ramps on the self wash tubs.< /review><userid>108605081120536795875<//userid>< response>

< Review>
I have come here before with my Husky and I was really happy with how he was groomed.  I brought my husky and Australian shepherd today to be groomed. We picked them up after an hour because they were ready. We didn't notice when we left that my Aussie was bleeding. After inspecting her paws, she was bleeding a lot. I got home and immediately cleaned it. But it's still bleeding. I really liked this place but now I don't recommend anyone coming here. I now have a vet bill because whoever groomed her was not careful. I provided pictures of her wounds. She is bleeding from two paws.  It's my huskys 4th birthday and now I have to spend the day at the vet instead of spending it with him. I'm beyond upset and am filing a complaint.<//Review>

Great place to wash your dogs. We had the best customer service. The gentleman was extremely nice and you could tell they really cared for our dogs. It was raining the day we went and they gave us towels to get the dogs and ourselves to the car dry. Definitely will be coming back. Highly recommend.</text>

My reviews are almost always 5 stars. The reason is I tend to write reviews for places that leave a real good impression. I should know the owners name I go in enough but darn if I can't remember. Anyway he is awesome. Always cheerful , helpful and deserves all the success I believe they get. They carry one brand of dog food Taste of the Wild. It is high quality and fair priced. The self wash is so easy and the nail trimming service is epic. I had the owner do it and my shy pup barely noticed. Good folks deserve good reviews. Why is there always some jerk who has to throw in a 1. We all know this is a 5 star joint. Thanks team you make my visits happy.</Review>

It was a bit small, but they took the time to work with my anxious dog and get her all cleaned up. It's nice to not worry about having her rejected because of her anxiety.< /text>

<gmapID>0x80c2b13d6366eba1:0x842024f014247f3f< /gmapID><text>Worth it many times over. I have a 65lb Aussie Samoyed that sheds like crazy and to not have to clean up the resulting fur storm of toweling and blow drying is worth the very reasonable price alone. Add to that the unlimited use of cleaning product and it's a great savings both in time and money to come here. What usually is a messy one hour affair in the bath tub (including cleaning afterwards) is 35 min wash with the convenience of not having to bend over the whole time. Would highly recommend if you have a hairy dog.< /text><username>Vincent Yu<//username>< user_id>

By far, THE best pet groomers!! We are moving soon to the Valley soon and one of the things that is causing anxiety for me is finding a new groomer for my dog. The staff members at The Pet Wash are patient, attentive and friendly. We'll miss the greatly!!</review>

Excellent customer service, the attendant walk us through out the proper use of the wash station and gave us an extra shampoo or rinse if needed more, we also had a nail trim service and they took care of my dog so good, it's the first time she did not bleed at all from using the clippers. Very recommended if you looking for a free cage self service. Definitely will be back soon with my dog. Thank you guys!<//review>

< Review>
Me and my boyfriend went here because our husky needed a wash. It was a chilly and windy day (never really have weather like this in Cali) so we couldn’t bathe her outside like we normally do. We decided to see if there was a groomers that allowed us to wash her ourselves and we stumbled upon The Pet Wash. It was less than 15 minutes from where we live so we decided to give it a go. We got there and the staff was really friendly and accommodating. Our husky loved it! She is usually not fussy when it comes to baths but the fact that the water was nice and warm must’ve felt relaxing. They provide you with everything! Shampoo, conditioner, Q tips for their ears, towels, treats and an apron! They also have a blow dryer to help dry your pups out. We were so happy with the service we decided to purchase a VIP package for future washes! Highly recommend!<//Review>

<text>has everything i need to wash my dog in this self pet wash with personal stations. love the ramps to the bath and the stairs to the grooming table. they offer other services like nail clipping and one of the staff members cut my dogs nails fast and efficiently that he didnt even know they were clipped. parking  sucks but that should not deter you. i always use this place.</text><name>Eric Ramin< /name>< date>

I love coming here, and so does my doggo. This place is never crowded. I go in and out in no time. The bath stations are always clean and well stocked with various shampoos.  what has great pressure which makes it super easy. There is a park right across the street which is perfect for me being that my dog hates the dryer process so i walk him to air dry. The only thing that sucks is parking. If you go before noon there is available street parking.<//Text>

I went in with my 70 lb pointer for a quick dog wash after he found some mud to roll around right before an international flight. They were very kind to my dog and seem to genuinely care about animals; while at the same time being very punctual and professional. My only regret is that I don't live in the area to use them more often. Definitely recommended!!< /review>

< Review>
This place is terrible! So we took our little Dog there three times. The last time she was ABUSED! Trauma, now doesn’t allow us to pet her! I’m so upset with myself for taking her there. When I called the manager she gave all kinds of excuses. I asked to see video which she said exist but refuses to show me!  Why? I’ve had this dogg 11 years and always did everything myself for this reason. DO NOT TAKE you pets there! Ask to watch them they won’t let you! Now I don’t know how to get my traumatized dogg who is always loving to be herself again! Do not put your loving dog at risk. Shame on them! They should be transparent! They won’t<//Review>

<Time>1542946395233< /Time><Rate>1</Rate><text>This place is terrible! So we took our little Dog there three times. The last time she was ABUSED! Trauma, now doesn’t allow us to pet her! I’m so upset with myself for taking her there. When I called the manager she gave all kinds of excuses. I asked to see video which she said exist but refuses to show me!  Why? I’ve had this dogg 11 years and always did everything myself for this reason. DO NOT TAKE you pets there! Ask to watch them they won’t let you! Now I don’t know how to get my traumatized dogg who is always loving to be herself again! Do not put your loving dog at risk. Shame on them! They should be transparent! They won’t< /text>< GmapID>

<Review>No compassion. No understanding. Sad example for human kindness and interaction. This business has no empathy for you or your pet. Their staff is more concerned with their own schedules than for the safety and comfort of your pet.

Backstory:

I was in LA picking up a puppy from LAX. The process took much longer than expected and we did not get the dog until later. The poor puppy had been delayed so long she had soiled her crate and herself. We cleaned her up as best we could and drove to the Pet Wash. We arrived 30 mins before they closed, but 30 mins after their imposed "no self bath" rule.

Given the circumstances and the fact that we had a 6 hour drive home, we begged and pleaded with the staff of the Pet Wash (there were about 5 people just standing about) to allow us to wash off this poor puppy. We offered to clean up the tub and area and even to pay 4x the cost of the bath. We offered to validate our story with airbill receipts so they knew we weren't BS'ing them.

The staff refused and turned us away.

We were forced to buy gallons of water from the 711 and try to wash her as best we could in the parking lot.

Never have I experienced such callous disregard from a business that caters to animals.

Had this been you, would you have helped an animal in need? I know I  would have.

I don't live in the area, so I don't have to threaten to take my business elsewhere. I hope someone who reads this will do that for me. People who are more concerned about some dumb rule rather than helping a suffering animal do not deserve your patronage.

THIS BUSINESS DOES NOT CARE. TAKE YOUR MONEY ELSEWHERE.< /Review></record>

<Review>My boyfriend and I visited The Pet Wash for the 1st time today, after having a horrible experience at another pet washing facility in Bixby Knolls, which will remain nameless!  We were escorted with our black lab to a clean, neat and organized station that supplied 4 types of soap, washing aprons for us, along with clean towels for drying.   We were really impressed, and our attendent was pleasant, knowledgable and professional while setting us up to complete our wash.  The environment was very clean, colorul and pleasent.  Once we were done, the owner spoke to use about the quality of their service and how they take pride in their treatment of their customer's pets.  We loved the sevice and definitely plan to return for many more visits!< /Review><name>producerlady1< /name><user>104984460833730533381<//user>< pictures>

Employee was very rude. Made up fake regulations, making me wear masks while they themselves DO NOT. They say "do as I say but not as I do! They are not taking it seriously just out to embarras the customer while themselves not adhering to the same rules. Also was very mad, angry and harrasing and threatening. How does such exist in this beautiful state? I'm at a loss, I will never return and tell anyone else not to buy here.< /review>

<review>Very unprofessional. Drove several hours for truck parts only to be threatened and sweared at by the yard guys. Seems like it happens often but nothing is done about it. If I knew I would’ve spent the extra money and bought the parts locally. It’s not a good deal for me when for a couple dollars I get degraded.< /review>< Gmap_id>

< review>
Drove here from Sacramento, to buy some front end parts, only to find out that half the parts were damaged. I offered to still buy the damaged parts and repair them, but they were not willing to work out a reasonable deal. A suggestion for all who are going to deal with them, ask for pictures of actual part before driving there to pick up the parts.< /review>

Very respectful, and understanding, and organized..... rules and regulations, and the deal on refunds, are all publicly posted.   We dont sale junk or suff thats broken, therefore if you buy something from here..... then try to get your money back or a different part, its cause you broke it somehow..... totally understandable.....< /Review></record>

The Employees here were very kind and accommodating. They change my oil very quickly. If I lived in the area I’m sure I’d be a regular here. They also give discounts to traveling nurses which I thought was sweet.  Oh and dog friendly!</Text>

We were on our way to Lake Tahoe when our the started losing pressure slowly. I panicked as we weren't carrying a spare wheel. We would be stuck on road if something were to happen to this. It was getting dark, so I found the nearest tire place and drove here. Mike was really helpful and reassuring. I told him to replace the tire as I wanted it done quick and wanted to get to the hotel before night. He checked the tire and told us they can patch it for just $20 instead if replacing which would have cost substantially more. And they did it fast as be we were on our way in less than an hour. Really appreciate the service and honesty.< /Text>

We wrote down everything that we found on that receipt. Then you came in for a wheel alignment, we wrote down on the receipt what we found then too. Then YOU put in new parts and asked us to align it again, which we did and noted again what we found. Then you came back and requested that we max out the stock front camber which we did at no charge for you again. We have done everything you asked of us and two times for no charge. I would like to discuss what you wanted us to do that we are not doing. Looking over the paperwork and talking to the guys involved we have done everything you requested, but obviously we are missing something that is making you unhappy."}< /resp><Gmap_id>0x809a50b74c80d8b5:0x4e71be1fe830324b<//Gmap_id><date>1576032386400< /date></record>

We were on our way camping when what sounded like my brakes were wearing out. Figured I better get them replaced before towing my trailer home. After checking my brakes they found a small stone was rubbing and making the awful sound. They put the tires back on and didn’t charge me. Highly recommend his shop for honesty and great service</Text>

Best service in Placerville - hands down!
Used another place for years, they changed ownership - again... and the service went way, way downhill.
Came to Sierra Nevada and have been coming here since.
Excellent customer service and professional and reliable service.
We will never return to the other place. Sierra Nevada Tires has definitely won us over!
Thank you guys!<//text>

These guys have always been awesome to me and they are true to their word. Had a really bad experience with big o tires and have never had a problem here. They provide full auto repair service as well. Go to them for pretty much all of my auto repair needs. Love them!</Text>

Took my ‘08 accord to Folsom Honda for the airbag recall and diagnose engine whine. After a speedy diagnosis ($60), the techs concluded that it was a drivetrain pulley ($600 job)

I opted to take it to Sierra Nevada for half the price, and they discovered that the pulley was fine and my power steering pump was cracked and making the noise. Pump/fluid/belt replaced($470), no noise, everything resolved.

The guys at Sierra did a great job. Thanks from the Haskell/Masters family.</Text>

About a year ago my husband and I decided to held our wedding at Legacy Ballroom. This place gave us a venue we could ever dream of. Hovik, Arthur, Yervand, Hovo and all the other staff are so professional, very helpful and very nice. I wish I can name them all but they were just the best of the best. The foods are so delicious and all our guests really enjoyed everything. This place is worth more than 5 stars. :)<//Text>

Hilda Solis Learning Academy held its Prom, Escape to Old Hollywood, this past Friday, April 27th at Legacy Ballroom. The venue is gorgeous and elegant. The staff and management are amazing. They worked with us and made the planning process easy. The appetizers and dinner was absolutely delicious.< /Text>

Beautiful venue for weddings. The hallway is a bit small. The food theme is middle eastern. Lots of side options. The meat kabobs was chewy. Overall. The food is decent but it bit on the bland side for my taste.</text>

I was the dj here for a wedding recently. Beautiful hall. Parking is easy on the street. Good acoustics. I also like the layout of the hall. DJ sets up across from the sweetheart table on a stage.</Review>

<Text>I did my wedding here on a Saturday for 210 guests.  The venue is incredible when it is fully prepared. The guests are never cramped in the venue is very well organized from the DJ table to the Head table. I definitely recommend getting the lighting package and also working with the staff to customize your menu. I was very amazed by the quality of the food and the service. I highly recommend getting the beef short rib and the seafood platter. Management is very thorough and present throughout the night to make sure that everything goes around smoothly. It was a great start to my marriage< /Text>< pictures>

We had our wedding at Legacy Ballroom almost a month ago, and it was ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL! The venue is beautiful, and their food is AMAZING! Special thanks to the chef!

When planning the wedding, we did not have a coordinator, so we had to find all vendors and organize and coordinate everything on our own. Everyone told us that we won’t be able to plan a wedding and have a successful stress-free day without a coordinator. But we are stubborn and determined, so we went on to do everything on our own (and we succeeded).

The event manager (Yervand) was extremely helpful and supportive throughout the whole process. He was responsive by phone and email, and was always happy to answer numerous questions and give advice. What stood out to us at this venue, compared to many others that we have toured (it was probably at least 6 more), was their levels of professionalism and care. All the staff is very professional and polite, and they treat you as if you are their good family friend, and they care about you and they genuinely want to help you.

On the day of the wedding, all our vendors and staff at Legacy really went above and beyond their duties and coordinated amongst each other, and we had zero problems (even without a coordinator)! It was a fantastic day!
We HIGHLY RECOMMEND Legacy Ballroom! And we hope to be back here for other occasions in the future!< /Review>

<text>What a unique establishment! The drinks are tasty and original - you wont get bored. The bartenders are very knowledgeable and helped me pick the perfect drink for my taste. The top and middle floor are not very large, so sometimes it's difficult to find a place to sit and the crowds can get quite large, but the atmosphere is very fun and I really enjoy the decor. A fun place to hit up on the weekends.<//text><Resp>None< /Resp>< rate>

<Text>You never know how much work is put into a banquet hall event until you host one yourself, but Yervand and his team at Legacy made sure to make the process as smooth and enjoyable as possible. They were extremely patient and flexible with us and accommodated each and every one of our needs; trust me, you can't find service like this anywhere else. If you book with Legacy, know that you and your family will be taken care of before, during, and even after your event. All of our guests were very pleased and satisfied and none of this would be possible without their incredible team. I can't forget to mention the plethora of delicious, mouth-watering food that the kitchen had prepared! We've been to multiple banquet halls and every dish seems to taste mass-produced but Legacy's food quality left the impression of a Michelin-star experience! We will undoubtedly stay loyal and recommend all our friends and family to LA Banquets for future events.< /Text>< date>

This venue was the best! My husband and I had our wedding reception here with only 6 months to plan. Their staff and management were there every step of the way making sure all of our needs were taken care of. Hovic and Yervand assisted us with outstanding service planning and executing the perfect day. Our family and friends had a great time and shared nothing but great things about our wedding. If you are looking to have a fun, simple, and amazing event we highly recommend the legacy ballroom and any L.A Banquet Hall :)</text>

<Review>We had an awesome time because of the guests and the DJ of course no thanks to the "legacy ballroom".
This was the worst and most embarrassing experience. THEY RAN OUT OF FOOD!! They brought food for 8 or 9 people for each table when we had 12 people per table. We didn't get what we paid for.  Many people told us that they left hungry, and that the servers were rude.
Even on the main table we asked for extra potatoes and they never brought it.
Multiple people found fruit flies in their water glasses and on the cheese plates.
Don't be deceived by the venues decor. I wish the management takes care of the food and service like they take care of the aesthetics of the ballroom.
BOOK THIS VENUE IF YOU AND YOUR GUESTS ARE ON A DIET.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>AMAZING!!!! Words can't explain how happy and pleased my husband and I are with the booking of this venue.

First off 👍🏼👍🏼 to the professionalism of the entire staff and management. The event manager was just wonderful. He was there the day of our wedding to make sure everything was going accordingly. The entire staff was so lovely and on their A game. Food was amazing and the venue just took my breath away. I literally cried walking into the venue.

Our family and friends we’re just flabbergasted with how everything turned out. This is the 2nd time using these guys and it definitely won’t be the last. I am a HUGE believer in you get what you pay for, and I couldn’t agree more. Good food, beautiful venue and quality service is exactly what my husband and I were looking for and that’s exactly what we got.

So a big THANK YOU 🙏🏼 to the entire staff at Legacy you guys have an amazing crew and brilliant event manager.<//Review><pics>None< /pics><response>None</response>< GmapID>

My husband and I got married at Legacy Ballroom this past weekend and it was just amazing! From the moment we booked our date, the planning and all the details leading up to the wedding was so effortless because they really take care of you. Yervand was great, always kept communication with us and answered all of our questions and made the process seamless. We held our ceremony and reception in the ballroom.

The day of the wedding we had a floor Manager, his name was Hobo and he was amazing! Always checking on us, making sure everything ran smoothly. The food was amazing, everyone keeps talking about it and we had midnight snacks (sliders, man n cheese, truffle fries) that were also great! At the end of the night, Hobo made sure that they packed us food to go! Thank you Yervand, Hobo and the rest of the team for making this a very special night to remember.</review>

Looking for a wedding venue was overwhelming. There are so many options and not enough information readily available online to narrow the choice. When I submitted an inquiry online to Legacy Ballroom, I got an email with Yervand's name and phone number. He was immediately available for a phone call, and not only answered many of my questions about having a wedding reception at Legacy Ballroom, but also helped me brainstorm through some of the other options I had come across so far. He was honest, professional, and gave me great advice.

Soon after, we visited the venue for the first time while searching for the right one. It is beautiful - even when it wasn't fully decorated for any upcoming event! The base decor is elegant, the LED screens throughout the venue are so impressive and can bring any ambiance you envision to life. After seeing the venue and meeting Yervand in person, Legacy instantly moved to the top of our list.

While planning for our own wedding, we also had the opportunity to be a guest at a wedding at Legacy earlier in the year, and got to experience the venue from a guest's point of view. The food from Anoush catering is delicious, the banquet hall looked even more beautiful with the lighting and florals, and the service was professional all night.

Throughout the year, Yervand checked in with us multiple times and we met with him every so often to go over questions, requests, and discuss how to make our November wedding unique to our vision and needs. Yervand is always professional, fun to work with, and ensured that we were getting the optimal services within our budget. What can be a stressful experience, went smoothly from start to finish with the help of a great team at LA Banquets!</text>

This past Sunday we hosted my sons first birthday party at Legacy and everything turned out perfect. I was so happy to be able to work with Yervand and his team of professionals who provided a great experience for me and my guests. I had the pleasure of meeting with sevan when originally booking the event, closer to the date of the event I worked closely with yervand in finalizing all details, johnathan was also great he helped me with all my lighting and led screen needs, and on the day of the party hovo overlooked the staff to ensure we had a smooth evening. Each contributed in a huge way to my wonderful experience.
The venue is beautiful as is, but they allowed me to get creative and enhance it with rentals and were so accommodating! I loved incorporating their LED screens into the theme of our event to add to the aesthetic of it all. Also, the tables were overflowing with delicious food which my guests were very pleased with.
Overall I was so happy with my experience and am looking forward to working with them again in the future! Thank you to all management and staff at Legacy Ballroom!</text>

< Review>
Our wedding in November at Legacy Ballroom was absolutely flawless thanks to the amazing team at LA Banquets! Since the very beginning of the planning process, everything was such a breeze and handled with the utmost professionalism and with our happiness and convenience in mind. Yervand was attentive to all of our needs and made sure too coordinate with all our vendors to ensure perfect execution of the plan. The client experience was always the highest priority during each meeting, and when it came down to the big day, all the details came together smoothly and we did not have to worry about a single thing. The timeline of the evening was coordinated seamlessly and we did not have to micro-manage anything. Yervand and his floor team made everything available to us and all our guests, who could not stop mentioning how much they enjoyed the party and amazing food at this beautiful venue. Highly recommend for any special occasion if you're looking for a stress-free and fulfilling experience.</Review>

Great Ballroom! location ok not hard to find. Wished there was more out door lighting.  Lighting was good but the DJ was in the dark in the ballroom... even though he was on stage...  I think communication could be better during this event... thank you!</review>

<response>None<//response><Review>My husband and I visited multiple wedding reception halls and we unanimously decided to celebrate our wedding at the Legacy Ballroom. We booked an appointment with Yervand to talk about the services, pricing and to see the hall in person. The hall is really beautiful, the carpets are a pleasant neutral color (not bright and obnoxious like other places), the dancefloor is spacious and long, there are multiple digital displays which make the place look really modern. There was more than enough space to accommodate our party of about 220 people. I really loved the cherry blossom theme that they played on the displays, the colors were beautiful and matched beautifully with my flowers.

Sevan also helped us with the planning as our big day approached closer. We picked our dishes from a vast array of delicious choices and were offered to sample the food, but we knew Anoush Catering is always delicious from previous experience. Our guests loved the food so much, everyone was happy with full bellies at the end of the day.

On the day of the wedding, the manager Hovo was a great help, he made sure we were happy and everything went exactly as we want. Yervand and Sevan were really patient and understanding, you really could see that they are passionate about their job.

Overall we are very happy that we chose Legacy Ballroom as our wedding reception hall and had a very positive experience with all the staff that works there.
From the bottom of our hearts, we want to thank Legacy Ballroom!!

<Review>From the moment we began working with management, we had the most pleasant experience. My mother recently hosted my bridal shower at the Legacy Ballroom. I cannot express how grateful we are for being so well taken care of throughout the entire process. From the moment we met with Yervand, to the warm welcome we received from all of the staff on the day of, everyone truly went above and beyond to make sure the event went off without a hitch. The servers were extremely attentive throughout the event, and everyone was more than satisfied.

If you've seen the venue, it goes without saying that it's one of the best looking banquet halls in the Los Angeles area. It's the perfect location for hosting any occasion. We were a bit nervous about hosting a smaller event (under 80 people), but the way they had everything set up was perfect and felt just right. They absolutely know how to make their space work for any event, large or small.

Thank you, Yervand and team, for making my bridal shower the talk of the family and all the more memorable!</Review>< Pictures>

<pictures>None</pictures><text>I had my wedding here just last week. All I can say is that every single employee at the venue goes above and beyond to make sure our special day is perfect. In association with the venue/amenities and food menu we dealt with Yervand. Yervand made sure that everything was ready and would even calls us from time to time to see if anything else was needed. He even included the color of napkins that my wife wanted without charging for it! The food here was amazing as well. Choosing from a menu, the food came out just as we had pictured it. For the venue's lighting and video, we worked with Konstantin. Konstantin made sure that we got exactly what we wanted in terms of lightening, spotlights and videos on the screens. The venue is absolutely breathtaking. From the column screens, to the beautiful dance floor and the chandeliers. This place absolutely stunned us and made our big day that much better. We even had a dedicated employee who would be at our service for anything that we needed during our wedding. To this day, we are highly impressed with the quality of the service and the beauty of the venue. I would definitely recommend this venue for any event!</text><user_id>103959335879997738919</user_id><gmapID>0x80c2c00e33b33051:0x5cbd1c711fa7350b</gmapID>< username>

I decided to do a christening for my kids and this was my first banquet hall I visited and I looked no further! I called and scheduled an appointment and they are so prompt and fast! Love how involved the team is in assisting in every way to make the customer happy no matter what! Beginning with Yervand who gave me the best service with his honesty and guidance on how to set up vendors and what foods to choose. How involved they were in everything felt like I had even hired event planners! I will refer everyone to Legacy! Love the ambiance of the hall and overall food and  service is just over the top amazing! Jessica also assisted me and so so sweet and on top of everything I was having the worst week she made me feel so much better with her kindness and hospitality. And when the day of my event came, which was this passed Sunday, oh my i was totally blown away with the service, setup and and everything. Hovo who was the floor manager at the event was just amazing anytime he saw me would ask if I needed anything always on top of it and constantly around he was the one person I didn't have to go looking for anything he was there wherever I turned to help in every way needed till the last second! How can I not mention the valet, they were so hands on helpful with my kids car seats and loading our cars... let's just say I'm so happy I chose Legacy and the whole team to host my kids christening!!! Thank you everyone! Can't wait to have another event here!!< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x80c2c00e33b33051:0x5cbd1c711fa7350b< /GmapID></record>

Highly recommended. EVERY WAS EXCELLENT, THE VENUE IS BEAUTIFUL, THE FOOD WAS DELICIOUS AND SERVICE WAS EXCELLENT. I live in long beach and I havent found a venue in the area that is as elegant as this one. Was it worth the drive? Yes it was, to me it was like driving to DODGERS STADIUM 😉😊.
We just celebrated my niece's quinceañera on June 30th 2019. All of our 170 guests have been talking about how great the service, the food and everything was. I have no complaints whatsoever and I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone.
Would I have another party here? Absolutely!!
Yarvand and Hovo were very helpful. Excellent service.
Being Hispanic my sister's biggest concern was the food, and if the guests would have enough. Everyone has talked about how stuff they were with such amazing food😋, We did family style
Thank you L.A. Banquet legacy team and Anoush catering for an unforgettable night.</Review>

The wonderful team and management helped us throughout the event to plan and organize accordingly. The vendor services which included crepe table, champagne tower, and coffee/tea table was amazing. The guests enjoyed and complemented about their great service. Overall, I would rate greater if I could. Thanks to Jessica, Hovik, Konstantin, and Yervand for everything!! We will definitely consider our future events at this elegant hall.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< time>

<review>My husband and I chose the Legacy ballroom for our special day and we were extremely happy. Our wedding was on May 5th, 2019.  All of our guests were very impressed with the ambiance, the food and customer service. They said it was the best wedding! Exceeded all our expectations and beyond!!! From the beginning to end we had a great experience.
We met Yervand last year when we were looking at venues and he was very knowledgeable, friendly and professional. He was very quick to reply to emails, calls and texts. Even after the wedding he checked on us to make sure we were happy. And you can tell he truly cares, he even helped us find the song for father and daughter dance by sending several options. Hovik was helping too when Yervand was off, he helped us when we went for the food tasting. Jonathon did a great job with lighting, slideshow and all background displays and was there all night. The servers was very attentive & polite. Hovo was our floor captain/manager during the event and he was extremely nice and professional. He made sure we're doing good, checking on us throughout the evening. Whatever our special requests were for that day was all done when we arrived. And he was very patient at the end when the wedding was over and he waited until we were all ready to leave. He made sure every single guest was okay & made sure their rides arrived before he leaves, including waiting for the bride and groom's Uber. We would definitely recommend The Legacy to our friends and family and would love to have other events there, maybe our anniversary.</review>< user_id>

<Time>1548733163411< /Time><pics>None<//pics><Review>I had searched for many wedding venues when booking our wedding venue. I'm glad that I booked it with LA Banquets Legacy Room. During the preparation part of the wedding, Yervand was great with suggestions and accommodations. We decided on this venue because of the state of the big back drop screen for videos (even the columns light up), lighting system is not notch and even includes uplights for tables, dance floor was amazing, and all around elegant look to the venue. We took advantage of their fog machine for the first dance and fireworks for our ceremony exit, reception entrance, and first dance. All the timing of everything was spot on.
As for the food, the food was amazing. I was getting compliments from all my guests that it was the most food that they've had and all the food was so good that they wanted to eat it again and take food home. I am glad that my guests had a great selection of food and didn't go home hungry. Also, Hovo and his staff were excellent from the food service to the bar. I couldn't have chosen a better venue to have had my wedding and highly recommend booking yours here. You will not be disappointed.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Legacy Ballroom has the best features one would need or want for any event. The ballroom is absolutely stunning-  from the moment you walk in, the chandeliers take your breath away. The lights, the floors, the stage, and columns that turn from a mirror into a bedazzling backdrop - is something so unique. The food is amazing, and the staff really goes above and beyond to make your dreams a reality. My fiancé and I booked this place right away for our wedding celebration because we knew the people at this place were going to make our wedding a fairytale. And they definitely made it happen!! Everyone was super attentive to any requests made throughout the evening. The food was not only delicious, but plentiful. The atmosphere was beyond words. We wanted to give a big thank you to Yervand & Jessica, who worked with us every step of the way, and recommended the best people/ places, and gave us the best advice before our big day. We couldn't have done it without you!! We wish this day would've never ended, because that's how much joy, love, happiness, and positive energy we received from everyone. We highly highly recommend this place to everyone. There is no event too small or large that Yervand and his staff at Legacy Ballroom wouldn't be able to accomplish with superb quality and service.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<Date>1549234370867< /Date><Rating>5< /Rating><review>One of the most daunting tasks any newly engaged couple can take on is to plan their wedding. There are thousands of details to consider and a thousand more you didn't even know existed. Fortunately, Nara and I gave ourselves 2 years to plan our wedding and almost two months into our engagement, we had already booked Legacy Ballroom for our reception. It was a no-brainer: the venue was newly remodeled, they had a state-of-the-art lighting/visual system, we already knew just how sophisticated and delicious Anoush Catering at Legacy Ballroom was, and the staff was incredibly professional with everything from setting up appointments, drawing up an itemized contract, all while exercising a completely transparent business model that kept us in the loop for every single dollar we were spending. Our event manager Yervand was a natural: he knew exactly how to actualize our dream wedding, made the perfect recommendations for us, and made sure that everything we signed up for was in our best interest and not for the business. Even when we were looking for outside vendors for things like a party bus, a travel agency for our honeymoon, and breakfast burritos, Yervand had a recommendation for it all (and we ended up booking through all of his recommendations--also that brisket breakfast burrito from Coffee Commissary is fire). I'm happy to say we've found ourselves a lifelong friend with Yervand, not just a professional relationship.

To all of the brides and grooms who are searching around for a venue, here are our takeaways:

- We were at capacity but at no time did it feel cramped.
- Yes, there's a lot of food brought out, but it's all delicious and it ensures that every palate is pleased.
- When in doubt, don't be afraid to defer to your event manager. I promise, they're on your side.
- Get the short rib. Shh. This is non-negotiable.
- Don't worry about ANYTHING on your big day, all details have already been outlined at Legacy and everything will be done exactly the way you want it.
- Get the short rib.
- Did I mention how perfect everything was? I mean, seriously.
- Do yourselves a favor and get the bridal suite to just hang out in, relax, eat, and drink before your grand entrance. They even have a monitor in there so you can keep an eye on how full the venue is getting!

Only a week has passed since our wedding, but we can't stop talking about it. Thank you to the entire staff at Legacy Ballroom, special shout outs to Yervand and Arthur, you guys are truly incredible people.

I am so happy to say that my wedding 2 weeks ago was amazing! I had the pleasure to work with Arthur Supikyan and Yervand Adamyan. They truly helped make our vision come to reality. Legacy Ballroom staff made this a remarkable experience from planning to executing on my wedding day. I have no complaints. I highly recommend this place for special events especially for small group of people. My wedding was perfect because everything was organized from the cocktail hour that includes a fantastic guitarist and their superb cocktail food and drinks. Everyone was raving about the abundance of delicious food (Anoush catering). The catering staff were terrific and constantly attentive to our needs. Hovo and the security men were just a pleasure to work with as well. I could go on and on, but it was a fun and a memorable night indeed!  Thank you, Thank you, Thank you!!!! on behalf of my husband and I!</review>

Hands down the best wedding venue we"ve ever been in.

We absolutely got what we wished for! Our wedding on July 1. 2018 went off perfectly and we could not thank Legacy Ballroom and their staff enough. Yervand, Hovo, Jessica, and the entire wait staff were so helpful. They helped us with the floor plan and accommodated all our requests. It was definitely well worth the price we paid for the venue. We had guests fly in from many parts of the world and they loved it. The way the venue was set up was spectacular!

The package they offered made everything easy. You would only need to add some of your own things or tell Yervand to handle it. The food was delicious, everyone (and I mean everyone) raved about it. The linens and lighting were on point. The dance floor was worth it. The staff were all attentive and professional. The booze was flowing.

We will have lasting memories here and I cannot wait for our photos to come out. We look forward to any events that happen at this location, and all of Anoush Catering event locations.

Is there a way to give more than a 5 star rating...?<//text>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) With my knowledge in cooking, I can assure you that the foods prepared there are very delicious. I loved being in a place where my joy was combined with good cuisine. My congratulations very good attention. . An observation to those in the bar. Not all of us know about drinks or alcoholic beverages, it is good to give information about the preparation of drinks. The very good valet is really worth the cost of the services at this place. 👏🏼👏🏼👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻🥇🏆❤💍❤🥂🍻🍺🍾🍹🍸🍷🍾🥃

I am from out of state and walked into Stanton Optical hoping to get my mom's glasses fixed for her.  The gentleman who helped knowledgeable me was , professional, and went above and beyond great customer service, and the glasses weren't even purchased there.

Everything was great and fast until the moment I came back to fix a small matter about my glasses. I waited long when it should've only taken 2 minutes. They spent more time on new customers than returning customers. Seems like if you're not making them money that day, your problem won't matter. Won't go here anymore.</review>

Just had my first real appointment to get my prescription and choose frames, the gentleman who checked me in and did my initial exam was so fun and sweet and then after choosing frames we sat with Whitney who helped us finalize our purchase. She was informative and helped me to understand what my options were and was such a joy to converse with. I would absolutely recommend Stanton and specifically Whitney to anyone who is in need of glasses she was AWESOME one hundred percent!! These are stressful times for both customers and employees so I really appreciate the wonderful service provided, thank you!!<//Review>

I have been here for the first time and this lady Alicia, Assistant Manager was awesome in solving my issue. My kid forgot glasses at moms and only here in modesto fo spring, which was no joy without glasses. I was looking for instant glasses and she was an angel to help me promptly with lenses which was a biggest favor to my child. I owe her big. I recommend seeing for any service in store. She will be your guiding angel out there.<//Text>< Pictures>

When we arrived at the Modesto office the receptionist said we didn’t have an appointment and she had no openings for the day we had booked.

I meet Prissilla a couple days ago when I had to return to Stanton Optical because a pair of my new glasses had broken. She was so nice I had to get on to write a review about her! My new glasses should be in within 2 weeks thank you Prissilla❤< /text>

During my visit Alicia helped me get quality glasses all while providing excellent customer service, making the experience feel more of a personal one rather than just another everyday sale. Thank you Alicia and Staton Optical!<//text>

<time>1611102278567<//time><Rate>2< /Rate><text>The optometrist was great, the ones helping do the eye exam were great too. However I’m completely not satisfied with the service from the woman who gets you’re glasses for you when picking them up. She was rude, unprofessional and had zero customer service. Not friendly at all. I was not acknowledged when walking in and when she handed me both my glasses, there were marks from the marker on the lens, there were no handkerchiefs included with the glasses. When I asked she said they were out of stock and I could “purchase” one!! Excuse me I just spent 330 dollars and it’s NOT included??!! Lost my business, I wear glasses full time, I will need more glasses and I will be taking my money elsewhere. I should have did my research more thoroughly.</text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

They have good deals like 50% off of your lenses and the lady that rung us up, Faith, was extremely nice and usually an antisocial person like myself would feel extremely uncomfortable during your eye exam or during the process of getting rung up, during the whole process everyone was extremely welcoming also everything was kept clean and covid precautions where taken</Review>

These guys knew what they were doing, and it was done efficiently.

-Eye Exam 5/5* - done remotely, quickly, and nailed the prescription (for me and my wife both, and I have weird eyes)
-Frame Selection 5/5* - tons of frames to choose from, no shortage of frames that fit my face
-Purchasing process 5/5* - The lady who helped me, Priscilla, was very helpful and honest (which you need when choosing frames), and I walked out of there with really nice glasses on order for an excellent price.<//text>

Very slow service, 2 for 1 deal with exam literally gives you about 8 frames to choose from.  If you use your insurance you have a co pay for exam. Prices are high for frames and lenses. .ost in store labs are CLOSED so even calling ahead to verify I could get glasses same day,  was told after purchase that most labs are closed and had to wait 2 weeks. When I picked up I had to wait in line for about 20 minutes to get served.  Terrible service</review>

Had many issues here. People are friendly enough, just soooo slow. The whole process is inefficient. Over 2 hours for an eye exam. Actual exam takes 10-20. Then wait for over an hour to try and fit glasses. Contacts are even more of a hassle. I wanted to just renew my contacts but the “doctor” tried changing my prescription. Then the receptionist was extremely rude and not hearing what I was telling her. 10000%%%% don’t come here. Compete joke. As sad as it is, Walmart is a better option< /review>

I made an appointment online and it was so simple. They were busy, but got me in on time. Then Whitney helped me with my bill and choosing my glasses. She was a delight and deserves a raise! She is great at what she does and has great customer service. You don't see that all the time anymore. I love the atmosphere and the selection there. I'll definitely be back!</text>

Don’t go in the mornings. Much less to pick up your frames. The manager in the morning doesn’t provide adequate customer service to inform anyone on what to do. The staff is running around trying to accommodate us more than he is. The only reason I can justify his actions is he is too busy making sales to assist the customers that already made their purchase. I’m giving two stars because of the product itself; the glasses are great but the service .... wait until later on in the day if you can. DO NOT COME IF YOURE RUNNING ON A SCHEDULE. YOU WONT MAKE IT TO YOUR NEXT APPOINTMENT or MEETING. GUARANTEED. .< /text>

An hour and a half to be seen WITH an appointment. 2 hours later i find out they only made a regular glasses prescription when i had made an appointment for contacts . They should make a lot less appointments in order to give a better service. Total disrespect of your time. Awful experience.</Text>

These people always lie to me over the phone. I asked if they had blue light glasses that I could buy the same day without having to order them, and they told me they did. I drove here and they tell me the exact opposite.
They also lied to my husband when he asked if they had a certain frame. They just wasted our time. Never again.</text>

<text>Wow! What an amazing experience. I had the pleasure of working with PRISCILLA who made this process so stress free and fun! She gave me just enough space to look at glasses by myself (how I prefer) & also helped me at all the perfect times. She ultimately helped me pick my second pair of glasses. I’ve worn glasses for 10 years, but Priscilla taught me things about picking glasses that I never realized. For example- the TRUE benefits of each different kind of lenses. She is an amazing person & I will DEFINITELY go back. If you ever drive by, It’s worth checking out! THANK YOU PRISCILLA! I love my glasses!<//text>< pics>

Although the location was very busy (11/17/19), and obviously understaffed, the three employee's working were cool, calm and collected. They were all exceptionally polite and very helpful. I especially want to mention Crystal who during my frame and  lens fitting never made me rushed, or just like another person to get through.</Text>

<Review>Priscilla helped me out with my contacts and her service was amazing. As a fellow retail/customer service rep, I found her service to be super resourceful and loved the attitude. Def. recommend Stanton as a place to visit for your eyewear.<//Review>< Pics>

<Review>Had a great experience here was treated so kindly by Alicia  she was super helpful in making sure I left knowing I was getting a pair of glasses that looked great on me. She was so sweet and took her time with me I didn’t feel rushed or pushed into buying anything. I recommend you go there and if your lucky enough you’ll be helped by Alicia< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x8090504b9dfe308f:0x4de296d70fe5582f<//gmap_id></record>

<time>1553816942433</time><Text>It might come off to be a great place with great customer service and a great price, but that just isn't the case. They raise the prices so that when it says buy one and get the other one off, it really just means you are paying double for the regular. Of course they are a business and have to make money, but that shouldn't be the case if the quality is so poor. I came in because we had a problem with a purchase and I asked if one of the managers could run the numbers for me. Instead of doing as I politely asked, the manager just rudely refused and treated my poor mother like absolute garbage, it was disgusting to see. Not only that, but when the glasses came in they got mine and my mom's prescriptions wrong and we had to get them changed. Even though it was an inconvenience, I had a small issue because I had other glasses I could use in the meantime, but my mom has to go to college and she just can't use her glasses. She talked to other people that bought pairs there and they had the same issue. Obviously the quality isn't there. The only redeeming factor of this store is their regular employees which showed much more respect and were much more kind. They answered all of our questions and helped us through all of our concerns. In the end, this company really needs to stop lying to it's customers, pay more attention to their quality, and remove suck up and rude managers that think they can treat anyone like garbage. Again, I am not bashing on the customer service entirety because I was very pleased with the employees there, instead, I am saying that they should have better management.<//Text>< Rating>

Intially there were some issues in regards the final billings, but the management was prompt to reach out and solve the issue. That's the reason I changed my review from 1 to 5 stars. I appreciate Jonathan the store manager's call. Hoping to do further business with them.</review>

<Review>I made a last minute appointment for the same day and was able to get in.  I broke my progressive glasses I use for computer work the night before.  When I got to their Modesto office, there were only a couple employees on staff.  I spoke with Brooke, who was in the exam section.  She apologized for the delay but will get with me as soon as she could.  I tool this time to look for frames,

I only waited for about 15-20 minutes and then had my exam.  They were still short staffed when I went to have a specialist work with me on selecting the frames and getting them ordered.  Brooke came out from the exam room and worked with me on the frame order.

Half way through this process, it appeared addition staff came in and it was business as usual.  There were still some people waiting but they all seemed to be patient under the circumstances.

A very big shout out to Brooke who assisted me selecting my 2 pair of glasses and even getting my computer glasses to me with 30 minutes.  Awesome customer service and she took her time and listened.

Will definitely recommend family and friends come here and ask for Brooke.  You guys have my business.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Day came and then they added an extra three days to the wait, when they say everything is done in house definitely shouldn't take ten or more days. Didn't explain my prescription or what causes me to need glasses. Push you to look for frames right off the bat without even knowing your going to need glasses. Just want your money.</Review>< pics>

While it was a while waiting for my eye exam, it was all worth it since our optician Mohamed made extra sure we could get lenses made for our own designer frames and reassured us of the quality of their lens-maker. He even got us a great deal! I’m sure I’ll be back for my next set!<//Review>

<Review>Super happy to come to this place! The prices are good, the staff is very kind and helpful and they do the lenses you need for your frame on the spot!! (If they have your prescription and lenses size in stock)
This is my third time coming here and I am always pleased with the customer service provided to me.
Thanks again for all the help you provided for me Jonathan, and the rest of the staff at Stanton Optical. I will be coming back next time again I need new frames and my prescription lenses!<//Review>< rate>

The glasses were great and Moe did a great job seeing the job through from start to finish. Highly recommend this place. Thanks guys. Keep up the great work!< /text>

<Review>They were really nice here! I was doing this by myself for the first time, and when I couldn’t find anything by myself, someone came and help. He spent a lot of time helping me, and made sure I found something I liked. He gave me a pair of glasses that I really liked for a great deal that stayed within my mother’s (who had a really bad attitude about the entire thing sorry Kyle) budget. Even with that, Kyle go me glasses I loved and put up with my mother’s nasty attitude 😅 Thanks Kyle! Thank you Stanton Optical!</Review><Rate>5< /Rate></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I enjoyed my entire visit with Kyle. From the moment I walked into their store. Kyle was courteous,  understanding,  and knew everything I needed. Picking out frames was fun!  He went thru my insurance and wrote down every price and all the comparisons.   Prices were very reasonable.  And I'm not your average single vision....Progressives with all the protection needed.  Absolutely a wonderful experience,  thanks Kyle!!!<//Review>< Pictures>

They called my wife back 3 times for 3 different test and it’s 4:20 and still waiting for this virtual doctor to look at her pictures. No sales rep or manager has came to us and told us it will be a minute or anything. This place has the worst customer service I ever been too. The 15 minute eye exam that they blast on there building is false advertising and will never come back.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

I went in on Sunday with my girlfriend who had an appointment. We were greeted right away, And shortly after prissilla was there to help my girlfriend. Since mt girlfriends been there before it didn't take long for prissilla to fix her glasses and send us on out way. She was very polite and helpful. She even recommended for me to come back and be seen by the doctor they have on staff. I will totally take her up on that offer<//text>

<rate>2< /rate><review>Poor experience, definitely a budget place.

Staff was relatively friendly, but the actual eye exams are done via a video conferencing system and aren't really very personable or helpful. My wife walked away with the prescription and we read later on her prescription that they recommended she see an optometrist for a glaucoma test; something which i would expect they should have told us there at the office. We did get a prescription, which was good, but she hasn't gotten glasses yet, so hopefully the prescription was alright.

Frames seemed to be overpriced, even with the deal we had, so we just walked out with the $45 exam.

All in all, this is definitely a budget place; I would recommend finding an actual optometry office that has in-person doctors. You're not going to be getting much more than a cheap place to get a eye exam for a prescription.<//review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

<rating>1<//rating><review>Appoint for an eye exam at 1015. Still waiting for a  hard copy of the script at 1155. Something to be said about being seen by actual professionals vs eyewear mills.
1210 had enough. I gave up and went home. By the way, the “exam” is a refractory only exam performed by some MD via teleconferencing, so hopefully you don’t have cataracts, abnormal retinal changes, eye cancer etc, as a doctor never looks inside your eyes. Hopefully, people will have a true exam before they need a new prescription.  if they do a more in depth exam, it isn’t mentioned when they book your appointment. Never again.
Update: it’s now 1308hrs.  They have ALL of my information. Haven’t even bothered to call to say the script is ready or anything of the sort.
Terrible place of business.< /review><gmap_id>0x8090504b9dfe308f:0x4de296d70fe5582f< /gmap_id></record>

I have been to this location a few times and they always take care of my needs. However, I came here earlier this week and Andrew really stood out. He showed advanced product knowledge and exceptional guest service. He went above and beyond helping me get a new prescription and finding the exact frames I was looking for. Thank you so much Andrew!!☺️</text>

<Text>If I could give more than 5 star's, I would give them a PERFECT 10. From the first step into the store the staff had GREAT 👍 customer service.  Our family will be loyal and forever customer's. A very special a heartfelt thank you to our sales man Mohamed . He went over and above to make sure we we're 100% sadisfied. Big shout out to Kyle for all his help. And to Emerald she was so helpful making sure our adjustments went smooth. Thank you again Stanton Optical.</Text><Response>None<//Response></record>

Mo helped us with my glasses.  He was very helpful from the moment we walked in until the time we left.  He was very professional and made us feel comfortable.  He was very knowledgeable and answered all our questions.  I would recommend if you went into the Modesto location you ask for him.  His customer service was outstanding I will definitely be coming back to this location because good customer service is hard to find.</Text>

Staff is very friendly and helpful with answering all our questions. Muhammad helped us right away, vision test was done quickly. There’s a big variety of glasses to choose from, which can be pricy but it’ll be worth it.</review>

<text>Although the staff was polite, I found them inexperienced when dealing with a more complicated eyeglass situation, resulting in giving me the wrong advice on frame selection. I had requested the glasses be beveled edged; they were not. I had advised I needed them in two weeks, was promised they would be; they were not. And although I had asked for anti glare lenses, they were not. Among other issues. The assistant manager made every attempt to resolve problems, and I give him high marks for his efforts, but no matter what, it came up short, and I ultimately returned the glasses.< /text>< gmapID>

purchased frames and lenses and 6 months later returned for lens replacement warranty. i was informed they stopped making the lenses. they said they could try and make duplicates of my lenses by tracin but they would not fit right likely, i asked if this is a common occurrence and they said they often change inventory and people are relegated to buying new frames. deceptive business practice< /Text>

I called this Stanton Optical to get an eye exam and some glasses. Was able to be seen that same day. The woman (can’t remember her name, or maybe wasn’t formally introduced) that gave me my eye exam was so informative and helpful, she explained what was wrong with my eyes and how to alleviate some of the discomfort I was feeling. After I picked my frames, Priscilla helped me choose the lenses that were right for me and explained the differences in each type of lense. She was so awesome!! Great customer service, you can tell Priscilla really just wants to make the customer happy and tell them exactly just how it is and what is right for their eyes. If you’re unsure of who to choose to get your new glasses, I would recommend Stanton Optical all the way! See if Priscilla can help you out, she’s the best!< /Review>

Worst Place EVER!!  I am so mad I could spit! My son broke his glasses and called Stanton Optical where he purchased his glasses, was told he could have them same day, he needs them to drive to work and to work with, it is a Saturday and he needs them by Monday, asked again before paying if he would get his glasses today and was told YES!, He pays for them and she says OK WE WILL GIVE U A CALL WHEN YOUR GLASSES COME IN...TWO WEEKS!   ummmm I need them TODAY like you said, even talked to the manager, cannot even give the money back so we can possible go to a different place. I will NEVER shop here again and will make sure to tell all my friends and family. Thanks for nothing.</Review>

STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE.... Seriously the worst customer service ever I would give it zero stars if I could! When my mother went to pick up her glasses she was forgotten about and they took 5 people that came in after before her until we got up to say something to Emerald. My mom tried the glasses on and immediately got nauseous and dizzy. She told us to come back in a week or two if they were still making her sick. My mother went back after a week because she was getting constant headaches, nausea and dizziness. Emerald swore up and down they were the correct prescription, the manager and her kept leaving and talking to other staff and kept coming back and  basically saying that my moms optometrist was wrong, they weren't going to make another pair or refund the money and because my mom was trying to get them to fix it Emerald was getting mad and actually started raising her voice to my mother who is almost 70!!! When I told her to stop raising her voice at her because I had enough of the rudeness, belittling and disrespect she lowered her voice said she wasn't yelling or raising her voice and I'm like now that you have been called out you lower it and howni couldnt believe how rude and disrespectful she was she walked away crying. Seriously?!? What kind of professionalism is that?? The lenses were made wrong, my moms optometrist (you know the one who's wrong) checked them and they were in fact made wrong. I will never step one foot into that hell hole ever again and you shouldn't either.< /text>

I want to say that Stanton Optical has been great with me. I wanted to mentioned a rep named David who went out of his way to ensure I get what I needed. There was a miscommunication on the promise time of when my glasses will be done since I lost my glasses for 2 months now and I been dangerously driving blind with my field of work. David took care of me by giving me a complimentary frame (no cost to me) so I can have something to use while they get my order sorted out. I wanted to personally thank David for his outstanding customer service and his advice on what works best for my eyes! Thank you so much for taking care of me and you guys are my primary eye care provider!<//review>

<text>Stopped by Stanton for an eye exam the other day because my glasses didn't seem to be working as well and it had been a few years since an exam and new glasses.  Long story but ... I left with a couple of pairs of nice, comfortable, affordable glasses and (more importantly) feeling like a super valued customer.  I will definitely be back.  Thanks to Mo, Mick and Israel.  Everyone I interacted with there was super helpful and genuinely seemed to care about their customers.< /text><rate>5<//rate><GmapID>0x8090504b9dfe308f:0x4de296d70fe5582f<//GmapID>< UserId.>

<Text>Mo was not only a great help but gave us both (my girlfriend and I) the best deals possible!

Loved the hospitality and knowledge of not only the Products, Benefits and Protection Plans but of my lifestyle after explanation of what I liked doing!

Mary Ann was literally so helpful! She made it fun and made me feel like she really cared about my glasses, what looked good or didn’t on my face! She is the BOMB. Highly recommend her if your going in for new glasses ask for her! She is Super friendly 🤩🤩 Give her a raise already!! 😁< /text>

<rate>5< /rate><review>Called Stanton on a Saturday afternoon, got a same day appointment an hour later. The staff was friendly and professional, the lobbies were all clean, no complaints about any aspect of this store. The exam was fairly quick and everyone was prompt and courteous with providing me information regarding my visit. The person who stood out the most, and the reason I’m leaving this review, was Jonathan. He was not only able to help get me some really good deals on the lenses I wanted, but he even replaced the nose pads on my current glasses as well as cleaning and tightening them. I felt like he really did his best to go above and beyond what he is required to do and I like to give credit where it is due. Would recommend this store to anyone in a heartbeat.< /review>< pics>

<review>We stopped by Stanton Optical today from out of town and I must say it was a rather refreshing experience. My wife was in need of new sunglasses so we decided to stop in due to the convenient location near the freeway. We were immediately greeted by an associate named Lupe who gave us world class customer service. Her overall knowledge of the product was impressive. We left very satisfied and will be returning soon.< /review>< Response>

Had an amazing experience here yesterday with Moe who helped me get my glasses and my eye doctor! Who I can’t remember his name. They both took time and greeted me and actually listened to me and helped me get glasses that best fit me! I highly recommend this place and will continue to come back!!!!</Text>

<Review>I went in to Stanton optical with broken glasses and luckily I was able to get an exam. I didn't have an appointment and they were able to squeeze me in.I was instructed to go to the back office and talk to the girls, Brooke and Aimee. They both were very helpful and made my visit so much better. They were obviously busy but they still made time to put me in the schedule. I have vision insurance but wasn't sure if I was eligible so while I was being pre-tested by Aimee, Brooke called my insurance carrier and was able to find out what my coverage was. Brooke and Aimee were great and thank to them I will be returning to Stanton optical for all my eyecare needs.<//Review><Date>1566013379816< /Date><user_name>StevieB OldSchool<//user_name>< user>

Stanton Optical was a great help today.  They were able to make a great deal for my budget.  My son was able to get his glasses in 20 minutes.  They are willing to help in anyway they can.
We will be going back to Stanton next time.<//Text>

I definitely recommend coming here they have great customer service and always get everything done nice and quickly!</Review>< pics>

Terrible experience! DO NOT GO HERE!
They lost my glasses and told me they would get new ones to me within 48 hours. IT'S BEEN 3 WEEKS!
The manager is avoiding me - they leave me on hold for over 15 minutes at a time, and when I DO get through, they say the manager is BUSY and WILL CALL ME LATER! The customer service sucks!
I'll be filing a complaint with the BBB .</text>

<review>This review is based on the great customer service I received over the weekend. I was in need of new sunglasses and have heard about Stanton so I thought I'd give it a try. Prissilla was beyond helpful. She greeted me with such kindness and helped me every step of the way. She knows glasses let me tell you! I did talk to her about my budget and she kept me well within that budget. I not only walked away with a great pair of glasses she also sold me on sunglasses so now I'm over the moon and will be back thank you Prissilla!< /review><Response>None<//Response><user_id>118066517856743339810< /user_id>< rating>

< Review>
This is a good place and they had a large selection of frames to choose from. Also there was a buy one get one free special on the frames, so I got one free, which was awesome. There’s also a one or two year warranty on the frames in case they break. Mary Ann was super helpful and friendly throughout the entire checkout process. I had a few questions about lens upgrades and different pricing options for the lenses and she made it as easy as possible for me. She also applied as many discounts as she could and saved me a lot of money on lenses.< /Review>

This morning I walked into the store looking for new glasses , after accidentally stepping on mine. Mr.Mohammed politely greeted me and was very patient on helping me find glasses that fit with my work environment and another pair for my day to day lifestyle. Mohammed  presented a good deal that matched my budget, saving me money and time.   Stan optical Team had my glasses ready within 30 minutes. I walked out a happy customer . 5 stars ⭐️ ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️🤓</review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x8090504b9dfe308f:0x4de296d70fe5582f< /GmapID></record>

<Review>I went for the two pairs of glassesfor $58 deal about two months ago. I got my first pair in two weeks. However I still have not received my second. They had broken my second pair at the lab. I came in to choose another pair, they put the order in, nothing came of it.  I have called continuously. I get transferred to the lab. They take down my information, but then I never hear anything again. I called for the status and it says the order is no longer there. This is two months, no answers or information.<//Review>< Date>

<review>Best place to get your glasses.  I recently broke my old glasses and was recommended to go to Stanton.  Jose helped me with choosing my two new pair. He was very professional and cares about the customers. I now recommend this place to anyone who needs glasses fast and good customer service. Ask for Jose.</review>< time>

< Review>
Words can’t describe how welcoming, helpful and friendly Stanton Optical as a company is. From start to finish, they truly are a team that wants to make you happy as a customer. Including their modern technology  that expedites many things. Availability at its finest.
They work with you, to meet you half way so YOU as a customer, are satisfied! Thank you SINCERELY to the whole staff for a wonderful experience, Mick( manager) & Tayla!! Another perk, you get a bonus for your family/friends up to four with additional discounts! Now that is what I call LOVE!!

Thanks Friends!

At first my prescription was wrong but then Davonte made sure my concerns were addressed and soon all of the staff made sure my glasses and prescription were on point. Davonte followed up multiple times during  my appointment, was polite, courteous and gave excellent customer service 10/10 would go there again once  I get a bit more money to take my mom in for new lenses. I am happy I was able to get a free exam without health insurance!!!< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

<Rate>2<//Rate><Review>Stanton Optical puts the worst possible commercials on TV.
Their commercials are violent,
loud, rude and obnoxious.
Their sorry excuse of a man even threatens a tiny dog.

Why these violent, loud, obnoxious commercials are allowed on TV is beyond me.

I am filing a complaint with the proper authorities and am asking that these commercials be banned.

What kind of a disturbed company would think these horrible commercials are acceptable?

I would go blind before I had anything to do with these people.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

<text>I've have been coming to Stanton Optical for 2 years, and I have to say I have a great experience every time I am in the office! The customer service is always friendly and knowledgeable. Their contact lenses are the best in the industry and glasses and frames are affordable! Thank you to Mick and his wonderful staff for creating such a great office experience!<//text>< pictures>

Mick was amazing. I had a tough experience with my glasses, but he was incredibly patient and went well beyond the call of duty in making sure I was happy and comfortable before I left. Great prices, great attitude. I'll be back for my contact lenses.<//Review>

<Text>They gave me an incorrect prescription even after i asked to recheck my eyes after wearing my trial contacts. I went to another office and sure enough i found out the prescription that Stanton gave me was wrong!!! I called n spoke to Adam office manager he assured i would get a call back regarding my exam refund. I did not get a call back,i called again then i was told he was on a conference call n i would get a call back. Few hrs later i get a call back from Mick regional manager n was told Adam is on lunch and he was going to assist me then i explained my concern n then he told me well you're prescription did not change that much. First of all any change is important especially when i explained the doctor it wasn't clear n i was getting headaches.Nick told me i could not get a refund for my exam. He then stated he would take this issue to someone higher then him. I asked him where i could called he said 1800 stanton isaid i called them n the transferred to the office. This place is a joke. Day and half later i get a call back stating my refund will be transferred back to me.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

They say that you can have you glasses the same day but what they do not tell you, that not all glasses are same day. Waited over 2 weeks then the 2 sets of glasses where wrong. When I was waiting a customer told me it took them 4 times to get it correct. They said give the glasses sometime and see how they are. I had to go out of town for work and did not return with in the 30 day money back guarantee and all they will do is have me start all over again.< /text>

The folks at this location were generously willing to stay after closing to send us home with glasses same day. Jose was exceptionally hospitable and was very fluid with building a rapport. I really appreciate them treating us like normal people and not just another customer.</review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>I don't write many reviews but I was impressed with the Service received here at Stanton.  I broke my glasses and could not wait 2 weeks for an appointment for a new prescription.   I am disabled and while waiting for my exam Brooke picked out several pairs of frames for me to try based on my request for certain styles etc.  She was very knowledgeable and very helpful in her choices! I purchased two pair (buy one, get another) so if one does break I have a back-up.  I would recommend this Modesto location.</text>< Pics>

<resp>None<//resp><text>Pressured me into all of their promotions with typical skeezy sales tactics. Put me at a 500 total for two pairs of $89 with all their specials and such included.

Fun fact: They don't accept any insurance at 100%, they only cover at percentages. And they don't tell you that until AFTER the eye exam. So if you only have one through your insurance, it's damn near wasted.

My sales person, Matt, kept trying to make it seem like they would take more from my insurance, when in fact he kept going for my pocket money. I had to be very clear and firm that I wanted 150 out the door, regardless of how basic I needed to go and would even forfeit the second pair. 30 minutes of him clicking later he stated he could do the 150 out the door, but again, from my pocket.

Again, take whatever you need off. He then kept saying it like it was a surprise. At the end of it all, it was either 149 out of my pocket through my insurance for two pairs, completely unaltered, or 150 out of pocket for 1 pair. Being that I had one eye exam on my insurance I was trapped.

TL;DR: Got two pairs of glasses (one sunglasses) for 150 out of my own pocket that will show up in two weeks.

Save your money. Get the eye exam, take the prescription, get your glasses online.<//text><Name>This One< /Name>< UserId.>

I give Stanton Optical 5 stars, this was the best experience I could have had getting glasses for the first time. They have extremely professional and friendly staff that took every step necessary to make sure I was a satisfied customer. Ruben just to mention one of the helpful staff was GREAT. I would recommend Stanton Optical to anyone. And I love my glasses!!!!!<//Review>

Honestly one of the best places ive ever been to for glasses! There were some issues with my order and Mohammed was more than helpful getting it resolved and was even willing to make accommodations for me so that I wouldn't be charged eventhough it was partially my fault that it happened. I would totally recommend Stanton haves down!< /Review>

<text>you’ll pay far too much for plastic glasses with lenses that no matter how much you try and clean them stay foggy. wasted three and a half hours of my life and $$$.

staff are miserable and in turn want to make you miserable. saw much of it during my 3 and a half hours there.

you’re truly better off elsewhere. LITERALLY ANYWHERE ELSE</text>< Rating>

The WORST customer service I have ever had.  When you go in to spend your money, they can’t do enough to help, but once they have your money they don’t do anything to help. Wait 4 days for glasses, then told had to wait another day. Sat there for over an hour and still don’t know if they have them! Do not go there, they are way to expensive for what you get. Worst place I could of picked for glasses< /Text>

<Date>1565312399222<//Date><review>Gotta say I'm rather disappointed. Some of the customer service is okay but, notes much the actual doctors.  When your doctor provides the incorrect lense vision for your eye, especially the one you need the most help with, and then wont even offer to fix it unless paid for everything again, is rather sad. I left the place with temporary ones, you know, ones that arent going to be perfect but close to being so. I got 6 month contacts, and the first ones I wore I'm thinking, "Okay it's just gotta be a defect in this one." So I opened another package thinking everything was okay that I should be able to trust these doctors making me pay nearly $200 just to see, it turns out the same. No matter how moisturized my eye may seem, the blur does not go away. I'm beyond disappointed and probably wont go back. They say you should give chances, but not when the first one was wrong then you have to pay for everything again.</review><user_id>101040947340617652214<//user_id><username>Emma Curran</username>< Rating>

<Text>Definitely a great experience, over the years the management has changed and it shows. The staff was helpful all while letting their fun personalities show. Once I finally decided on my frames the process was so quick... I did not expect to be leaving the same day with my new glasses. Two thumbs up 👍👍</Text>< pics>

So I came in for an eye exam to get a prescription for both contacts and glasses. At first I was so dissatisfied after my eye exam, due to the receptionist who didn't know what she was talking about or doing for that matter. Luckily Jonathan could see my frustration and he ended up helping me find the perfect pair and I was able to get them that same day. He was super helpful and sweet and ended up giving me a good deal on them, really happy with Stanton Optical thanks to Jonathan, and they'd be doing themselves a huge favor to get rid of their receptionist to make sure that everybody's experience doesn't get ruined.</Text>

Went in today, w/out an appointment, and was surprised when they offered to see me same day. They were extremely busy but Kassy and Brooke got me in to see the doctor right away. They were very helpful and made a great team--they fed off each others humor making it the best and most fun time ever having am exam. Thanks girls--i will most definately be back and will bring family. Best time ever!!</Text>

I came in unsure if I could afford glasses.  After working with Brook I ended up getting two pairs. She gave me a deal I couldn't refuse.  She was super sweet and understanding.  I'm so excited I'll be starting the summer with a new pair of glasses! I will update when my glasses are delivered. Thanks Brook!<//Text>

I already had an up to date prescription, but I needed a new pair of glasses so I decided to see stop at Stanton. There was such a great selection to choose from. Mick helped me pick out a couple pairs-- he was very helpful and on top of it, hilarious, which helped the time pass quickly. I was trying to compare prices to other offices I had visited in the past and Mick went through the trouble of going through every option I had in mind so that I had every price laid out in front of me. With my experience, I will definitely be returning!</text>

She was so friendly so nice and knew exactly what she was doing.  Was so patient with us and helpful. We shared stories back-and-forth .  She treated us more than just a customer . I highly recommend seeing Brooke . She is amazing. She also got us a little discount through our insurance which I had no idea about . 5 stars for Brooke and  Staten Optical!<//review>< userid>

<response>None</response><text>First time here and defiantly won't be my last. Absolute amazing experience. If I could give it more stars I defiantly would. Called to make a last minute appointment and they took us right away! Came in and was greeted almost immediately and directed to where we were supposed to go. The eye doctor took us in 5 minutes after coming in and had just a wonderful personality! Extremely nice staff and clean environment. I highly recommend asking for Brooke when searching for the right glasses for you because we didn't feel rushed and she stood close by for any questions. Payment experience was a 10/10 Brooke was super understanding and extremely helpful. Glad we found her today💗 Defiantly recommend everyone try Stanton optical!!😊< /text></record></dataset><record>

Great place! I am a first time customer and the staff made sure that I walked out with satisfaction! Brooke was excellent! She gave me a new frame for my broken glasses meanwhile my new glasses were getting ready. Highly recommend!< /review>

<review>UPDATE -  Store manager called me and apologized for the inconvenience due to other guy's behavior and offered to make things right this time. I went there, got re-exam done with new glasses. Store manager also offered me free powered sunglasses. Thank you.

My Last Review - These guys do not care about you after they get your money. Staff is really rude and non co-operating. Not worth going here. I went for a recheck after I had blurry vision with my new glasses and they wouldn't let me see the optometrist during the weekends, even though they could do the initial eye exam on a weekend. Not even on Fridays. When I requested to let me get another exam on a weekend or same day since I cant take a day off for this 15 minute appointment(I work in Palo Alto), the guy threatened to call the security to get me out from the store while I am with my 17 month old son. I Will escalate this to their higher management.<//review>< rating>

AVOID!
I was told I could pick up my glasses the next day - but when I went to pick them up they had no idea where my frames had gone!? The workers here are incompetent! I had to wait over a week before I received my glasses. They didn't even tell me when the glasses arrived! All this place wants to do is rip people off!<//Review>

<review>Ask for George to get the best deals. At first glance, everything looks expensive. My niece was in need of some glasses. I was on a budget and was worried about the final price. After George helped us, and made it easy and affordable. My niece is happy to walk out with 2 glasses with all the additional things included. Im talking about insurance on the glasses, hard coat, UV protection, and more! It was an awesome deal!! Thank you George!! I will definitely come back!!< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

Worst sales/doctor experience I have ever had. My son and wife had to wait 2 1/2 hours during their initial visit. They never called us when my son's sunglasses were ready. We had to go by the store and prompt them to find out where his sunglasses were located.  After a 1/2 hour they presented us with his sunglasses which were missing the nose pads and told to come back in 2 weeks in order to replace them. Never again. PS Stanton Optical is not compatible with VSP insurance.< /Text>

There is a pivotal point in a business where the customers are heard or the business fails. Stanton optical on Sisk road heard our voice. With Kyle and Sales manager Brian (i so hope this was his name because he deserves recognition) heading up the best ever customer service, i am proud to say i will not have any reservations in coming back like i did today since the weeding out of the low hanging fruit they had staffed. Thanks guys< /text>

They offer options on how much of your lens you can see out of. Never mention things like poly carbonate or scratch resistant lens. Poor selection of frames. Staff are hard salespeople. They keep it dark including when you pickup your glasses and have you stand at a dark counter to try them on. This companies practices should put them out of business none to soon. Keep going to reputable optical offices. This is not one.</review>

My husband and I both went in to look at glasses, we were greeted by George.  He has wonderful customer service, explained everything and took time to help us with all of our questions.
The prices were very reasonable and were ready in days.  When we went to pickup our glasses the general manager Brian Ridge assisted us.  We will recommend Stanton Optical on Sisk Rd to all our family and friends..</review>

WORST.  PLACE.  EVER.
I called after an issue with the Fresno store where the optician asked me out to drinks, told me he was doing me a "favor" by giving me contacts (huh, that's a service I thought I was paying for) and otherwise sexually harassed me.  Upon hearing my concerns, the Fresno office did not offer me a refund so I can go to a professional optician who is not a total creep, told me there are no other optometrists in the Fresno office I could see, and sent me to Modesto.  I spoke with a manager on a Wednesday who said he'd call me back.  He didn't.  I called mid-day Thursday.  Was placed on hold for 17 minutes after being told, "he is on the other line, he'll be right with you".  The line was picked up and then mysteriously disconnected.  I called right back.  A woman answered.  I explained that after being on hold for nearly 20 minutes I was disconnected.  I asked to speak with the manager.  She offered his name, "Michael Z.", and gave me a direct phone number and then transferred me, presumably to him.  A woman answered.  I said I was looking for the manager, Michael.  She told me there was no manager by that name.  Was I calling the correct store?  I explained that I was transferred internally, so yes, I was calling the correct store.  She related that the manager was at the bank and might return in "about a half hour".  I noted I had been holding for 20 minutes, so why didn't he speak to me before leaving for the bank?  She blandly said, "I'm trying to help you".  I said, 'If you'd like to help me you could get me to a manager and it seems really odd that the store employees don't even know who the manager is".  She told me I was "raising my voice" which was odd as I spoke in the same tone and volume the entire time.  She said, "Well I'll let him know you called", and the conversation ended.  I wonder how she will do that as she doesn't know my name or contact information.  I say GO ANYWHERE BUT HERE.  Flying monkeys would have to be able to give better customer service.  This is an unprofessional business not remotely interested in customer service that should be ashamed to open its doors to the public.< /review>

Brian was super friendly and very professional. He made sure all  our needs were met. My husband was able to get his lenses replaced while we waited in the store! It was a blessing for my husband to leave the store with his glasses adjusted and the new lenses replaced so fast and efficiently! My glasses were supposed to take 6 weeks to make and Brian helped it happen to where it will be ready in 48 hours! Thank you, Stanton!</text>

My sister needed glasses, we decided to check out Stanton Optical since we've been hearing great things about this location. Shortly after we walked into the store, we were greeted by Rubin. He told us about the BOGO deal going on in the store, and answered our questions before we went off to pick out some frames. Customer service is huge in my book, so I truly appreciate Rubin being so kind and patient with us. You can tell that he really enjoys his job and is very knowledgeable at what he does. My sister loves her glasses, and I look forward to going back and working with Rubin again!

Thank you Omar for your assistance as well! You guys down at Stanton Optical are the greatest. I definitely recommend this location based on customer service alone. Again thank you!< /Review>

These people are great. Super inexpensive they have mastered excellent customer service while getting a whole lot of people seen and taken care of. Special shout out to Brooke and Samantha. Brook saved me $ and is super sweet. Samantha was bubbly and nice. George and Jose helped us with our glasses and even hooked me up with a charge for my phone. Great job guys.<//Review>

I was pleasantly surprised by the service I received after reading all the reviews of Stanton Optical. I was greeted the moment I walked into the door. The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. Gabby was great, so was all the others we came into contact with. I learned that there was an entirely new staff. If you have any reservations, please put them aside and give this wonderful staff a chance. Don't make this new wonderful staff pay for mistakes that others made. I know I almost did, but glad I gave them a chance.< /review>

Went in today for a $99.00 contact and eye exam for my daughter they took her in for exam without going over pricing we were there 2 hours and at the end they didn't honor the promotion that was valid  but we still got stuck paying for a eye contact exam no stars they need to communicate and go over pricing first its people's money and lives that they are messing with they dont honor what is clearly on their website  check prices before any eye exam otherwise your stuck  paying higher prices< /text>

OMG , very professional optical store . We were very pleased with the service that we have received from this store . Especially , with help of Kyle Mountain ( sales manager ) who helped us through out the complete process from picking the right frame to final check out. He understood exactly what we were asking about and he knew all of his promos on top of his head and gave us a great deal on multi eye glasses  . Also Mr. Devonte Barksdale was very helpful in explaining the ways that promotions work to get the best benefit out of all available promotions< /review>

<pictures>None</pictures><review>I've gone to Stantan plenty of times, but this one was pretty special, as much as an eye exam can be I guess. Stantan saw me same day I called to schedule an appointment, it was pretty busy when we arrived there, but there was still no wait time, I was seen almost immediately. The staff and doctor are incredible, finished my exam sooner then I'd anticipated. Mohamed made the difference today, after the exam my mom and I had fun trying on different frames. Mo attentively asked if we needed any assistance, and we did because between my mom and I we collected about 10 frames that I had to sift through. Mo worked efficiently and catered to my concerns. But never have I ever left with one complete set of glasses that wasn't the stock wired frames. Like I got to walk out with a complete pair of designer glasses I get to wear today. The little things that make a big difference. Never had that experience. You don't see many professionals like Mohamed, who will put customer service above all, who goes above expectations, and excels in client trust. Thank you Mohamed!<//review>< username>

<review>Went in today to get an eye exam for contacts and eye glasses. The eye doctor was very nice and the exam was fast and he was able to answer all my questions. The staff is very friendly and professional. They have the best pricing on both contacts and glasses. Jonathan was very helpful and got me a good deal on my contacts. Walked out with my trial run on contacts and can't wait to go back and get my glasses as well. I will definitely recommend this place for anyone who's looking for a good price on their optical needs.</review>< Rate>

Went in yesterday to get new glasses and was immediately greeted and helped, the staff there is amazing! Jose was very helpful , Mariana was also very patient while I chose frames (I'm super indecisive) I never felt rushed or pressured.  Kayla , Omar & Lupita kept me company while i waited for my glasses, they were all very friendly & genuine. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking to give this place your business. Great atmosphere, prices and overall experience! Thanks guys!<//Text>

< Review>
After I picked up my glasses at this place, I realized that they didn't come with the clothe to clean them, so I went back to ask about that. One of the sales guy ( Tall, glasses and pony tail) told me they sell the kit to clean them. That's when I said " I paid over us400 for my glasses. I should get a cleaner clothe" and he said  " well we gave you a free case" worst customer service I've ever had. I regret using this place.   He made me feel like I received the glasses for free. He was a real AH. Do not get your glasses at this place. You better off at a place like LensCrafters. Make sure you get a real case. This place SUCKS!< /Review>

<text>My daughter and I went there today after a friend's recommendation. It was busy today so our wait time was a bit long. They offered us a 20% discount for the inconvenience which I really appreciated.  The doctor was great and discovered an issue with my daughter's eye that hadn't been caught before. Jose helped us with our purchase and he was very kind and worked very hard to help with some of my concerns. They have a lot of frames to choose from and it was really great being able to get our glasses within an hour.  We love our glasses!</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< UserId.>

<time>1549135810090< /time><Rating>1< /Rating><text>Service is horrible.  NEVER GO THO THIS PLACE. STAFF ARE RUDE.  Can't get the order correctly. Ordered contact lenses, they said it will take 1 week. Went back a week after, not ready yet. Comeback in 3 days they said. Called them 5 days later, they said not ready yet will call you when it comes in. Never got a call from them so we went to the store, they have it. We got home, found out wrong prescription, returned it. They said it will take another 2 weeks for the replacement. Three days later we got a call, it's ready. We pick up, still WRONG. Call them again, put on hold for 20 minutes, finally someone answered,  and this is Alyssia, she said she will go and find out the status after she is finish with her customer in front of her. I said I will call again after 10 minutes if that is better. Called again, It's Allysia, "I did check her file but I need to do deeper digging, I am so busy right now. I have a customer in front of me that I have to deal with.I will call you back."<//text>< pictures>

A must go to when in need of glasses. They have the buy one get one free! The employees are super friendly, they helped a lot in picking my frames. Mick was the person who helped me and made the process 100 times better than it usually is when I'm shopping for glasses. Highly recommended 👍<//review>

The salesman George was absolutely awesome. I had bought a pair of glasses, I was on a tight budget and he helped get me exactly what I wanted under my budget. They (unfortunately) broke two days later, went back and he had them fixed in 10 minutes.< /Review>

If you have zero intuition, they’d take advantage of you. They wear masks and their only mission is to take your money for their quota. God forbid you try to leave with a prescription without buying anything else. Then the real rudeness/unpleasant experience comes. I feel sorry for the elder or unaware that go along with their propaganda. I overheard being called a “pain in the ass” for questioning their work.< /Text>

Today was our first visit to Stanton Optical (in Modesto, Ca).  We were assisted by Stacy Sandoval.  Stacy was "very" helpful.  She was exceptionally professional and also very knowledgeable.  During our consultantion, my husband and I found out that Stacy really loves what she does which means quite a bit to anyone who needs her service.  We will definitely return when and/or if we ever need new glasses again.  Perhaps we'll just stop by just to say hello.  Thank you Stacy.  We truly appreciate you...!!!!</Text>

<Resp>None< /Resp><Pictures>None<//Pictures><review>This is my second time getting a prescription and ordering glasses here.  I guess since I had been there just under a year ago, they had me do my exam with a remote optometrist.  It was quite interesting, but in the end I requested to see the doctor there.  I am not young and felt that someone should actually look in my eyes.  She was great and figured out that the blurriness I had was the need of a prism in my lenses.  All of a sudden, everything was clear.  Due to progressive lenses, transition lenses, the prism, and my desire for other than the cheap frames, I paid much more than the ads say on TV.  But do you know what?  They are still well priced compared with what I've paid elsewhere.< /review>< rating>

<review>Unfortunately, I broke my old glasses and lost one of the lenses. This happened about a year ago... I finally decidied it was time to get a new pair. I came to Stanton Optical in Modesto because they were able to accommodate to my needs. These needs being I needed a new pair of glasses that day! I ended up leaving with 2 new pairs of glasses and a box of contacts. The staff here are incredibly friendly, patient and make you feel so comfortable. If you need a pair of glasses, contacts or an eye exam I would 100% recommend going to Stanton Optical in Modesto!</review>< response>

<Text>The eye exam was fine but it was a nightmare trying to get the correct frames / correct prescription after that. They gave me a single lense when I asked for bifocals and they were the wrong prescription. In addition they gave me the wrong frames. They didn't offer to refund or to refit the glasses.</Text>< pictures>

<Review>For starters, this is the first time I've ever been to Stanton, and was warned not to go but at the time I couldnt find anyone that takes my insurance.  I walked in and there was no workers to be found, not knowing where to go I ended up waiting almost 10 minutes for someone to show up and tell me where to go. The only reason I give 2 stars is because the exam went fine and the ladies were very polite. After my exam no one came to help me, and they ended up helping people who came way after I did. I waited almost an hour before just walking up to a worker and asking for help paying for glasses, the lady outright judged the glasses I chose. THE EXAM IS NOT FREE WITH THE BUY 2 GET 1 FREE. It is not even worth it especially for the price you pay. I was told my glasse would be ready in 20 minutes but waited almost an hour.
I arrived at 1055 am for my appointment and left after 1:33PM.< /Review><Rate>2</Rate><user>116366937814758119954<//user></record>

The customer support insisted on booking an appointment despite my request not to. I was unable to get any co pay quote without going in person which I guess is logical since it would depend on the prescription and type of lenses needed. They were nice. Booking the appointment could've been less pushy though.<//review>

<text>Even tho my insurance paid for all costs of my frame and lenses, I am still not satisfied with their service. I told the guy that was helping me with my glasses and I told him to add "anti-reflect" coating on my lenses, but it came out with nothing on it. It also took really long time to get the job done, about 1 week and 2 days to be exact. I asked the guy again about the anti-reflective coating and he still insist that they've added that on my lenses. But just by looking at my new glasses, I can't see any coating on it and it has glare when night driving. I recommend go to Costco its faster and better service.</text>< Pics>

The glasses I purchased broke within 3 weeks. They were within the 30 day customer satisfaction period and I also purchased the insurance on them. Stanton still charged $60 to replace them and used the same lenses. It didn’t seem right so I went back and Tayla fixed it. Thanks Tayla.<//text>

<Text>I had never been to Stanton Optical before, but I had a broken pair of frames and my regular optical place was not open so I went to Stanton Optical.  I was helped immediately.  I had prayed that God would help me find frames that I could afford (as most of us I don't have extra money on hand for these emergencies).  The employee graciously understood my predicament and found a pair that was very reasonable.  She replaced my lenses for me and then the miracle happened.  When I got to the check out counter she said "there was no charge".  They hope to treat people fairly and always have good deals available.  I WILL ALWAYS give my business to Stanton Optical in Modesto, CA. Thank you Stanton Optical for taking care of me above and beyond what could ever be hoped for. Sincerely, Claudia Horne< /Text><pics>None</pics></record></dataset><record>

DON'T FALL FOR THEIR BAIT-AND-SWITCH ADVERTISING!!!
I made an appointment with Stanton Optical because they were advertising a great deal: an eye exam and 2 pairs of glasses, all for $78. What they don't tell you until you're in there is that the special price only applies to the "value" glasses. The "value" glasses are a very small selection, and all super-ugly frames. If you want to actually look decent, you'll have to pay full price. I was unpleasantly surprised to learn this, but the "full price" listed on a lot of the frames was about $50, an amount I can handle, so I went ahead and chose a couple pairs. My unpleasant surprise continued when I found out at the VERY END of my visit there, that the prices listed on the frames is ONLY for the frames, and they charge an additional $200 to install the lenses!!
I ended up paying over $300 altogether (even with their BOGO). I went ahead and paid it against my better judgment, because by that point I had been in there for HOURS and needed to get home and relieve my babysitter. I regretted my decision, and contacted Stanton Optical the next day to arrange to return the glasses for a refund, and to get a copy of my prescription so I could purchase glasses elsewhere. I called 3 or 4 separate times that day, and nobody was willing to help me. I was either left on hold for a half hour, or told to call back later.
I'm extremely unhappy with Stanton Optical's failure to disclose their pricing in an upfront and honest fashion, and downright disgusted with their failure to provide any customer service over the phone the following day. There are tons of optometrists out there, do yourself a favor and pick a better one.<//text>

<text>We are very happy with our purchases and with the wonderful support we recieve from the Modesto team.

Jonathan is friendly, helpful, and always smiling. He appears to be knowledgeable in all aspects of his job and supporting customers needs.  He helped my husband and myself with our purchases and understanding our coverage.

Jose was very helpful when my husband  picked up his glasses.  Jonathan helped me with mine and adjusting them for the correct  fit.

Tayla did a great job updating an old frame with the new prescription lenses.  She is very kind.  .

Although Brooke didn’t help us this year; she remembered us and said hello.  So glad to see she is still there.< /text>< Name>

<Rate>1</Rate><review>I received an eye exam and chose my frames and lens for new glasses. I got my eye exam Sunday. They told me I could pick up my glasses anytime after 3:40 on Tuesday. I went Wednesday at 5:45 and they told me I couldn't pick them up. I tried again Sunday around 2 pm. After waiting for 15 minutes, I said I needed to pick up glasses and they told me they could not give them out on Sundays. Why? I have no idea. If I knew ahead of time I could not pick up my glasses on Sunday, I would not have made trip. I wasted my time and gas money. Twice they have failed to give me my glasses.

This place is a nightmare.  First, one of the sales techs tries to tell me I need contacts for the wrong eye.  Then she orders me a different wrong perscription.  Im still trying to get the issue worked out.

Side note, mens bathroom doesn't flush, doesnt have soap and the faucet doesnt work.  So disappointed that I spent my money here.  0 out of 5 stars.

Came back a third time to pick up my due to a phone stating my perscription was ready,  it was not.  It wasnt even ordered.

Worst service I've ever received in my entire life.

Avoid this place at all costs.</text>

<review>Had my first experience with Staton Optical.

First and foremost, Brooke the frames specialist, is amazing! She is extremely courteous, helpful, and very knowledgeable!

My new glasses were ready to be picked up early, which was great as I was coming from out of town.

The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 was, as other reviewers have stated; my actual eye exam took way too long to be seen by the optometrist. Their appointments are overbooked and there was only one technician working the exam office.

Overall, a good  experience at Stanton Optical in Modesto!</review>< time>

Technician holly was very pleasant and assisted me in a timely manner, my trip to the office was great. To make things better they were offering a groupon $30 for $200 that I got to take advantage of.</Text>

Customer service is key to any business and Stanton Optical Modesto location is on point.  I was hesitant because of reading the bad reviews, but wanted to give them a try since most of the bad reviews are from a few years ago and I'm sure glad I did.  The service was amazing from start to finish.  When I walked in, I was greeted by Brooke who guided me thru the whole experience and even got my glasses done the same day. She made spending money fun!!!! Thanks for the great service and a special thanks to Brooke for making my experience top notch!! See you next year.</review>

My experience with the customer service (this time) was pretty good. I have an issue with my lenses though. Ive gotten glasses from this Modesto store before and my vision was good. My glasses fell apart and the replacement pair was wrong. I even paid for a new exam and it's still wrong.

They gave me a little upgrade on my glasses to make up for my last bad pair, which is cool, but it means nothing if I can't see. Now I have to go elsewhere a pay for it all over again.< /text>

Bad customer service. I've heard good things  but unfortunately when I went in to get glasses the manager was very rude. They also told me I could get the glasses the same day but they lied - I would have to wait 2 days. I told them I couldn't do that because I'm from Tennessee and needed the glasses to drive back because I lost mine. The manager laughed at me and said I could mail them to you.... Seriously?! I needed them to drive not to be mailed. I have a time limit. Also the reason I couldn't get the glasses is because he finally started taking my order at 6:10pm and then when I asked when I could get them that's when he said I couldn't get them till Monday. I told him that they said I could get them within the same day and he said yeah but they shut down at 6pm. I arrived at 5pm with them knowing that I needed them that day... Then they (the manager) made me wait until 6:10pm after they shut down. Bad customer service on the sales floor. The optometrist was wonderful though.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<Text>My overall experience wasn’t great, but Brooke, the eye care professional who helped me post exam was amazing. She’s incredibly knowledgeable, kind, and helpful in every way. I can’t say the same for the attached department doing exams. Very deceptive and incredibly unorganized. Made an appointment for a contact and glasses exam, upon arrival was told the only doctor “in” does glasses exams only..except there are no doctors here. Your exam is done remotely by someone on a tv screen. Got sucked into that one. Now I have to make a separate appointment to get a contact lens prescription.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Do not book appointment through call center; they will mess it up or double book you. It is best to call the (209) number. Optometrist and her front desk staff were nice and quite knowledgable. The selection of frames was OK I still prefer Costco or Lens Crafters. During the summer the heat in the lens display area was barely tolerable. The service was slow they need more staff to help select frames.< /Review>

I am so over this place. I swear it’s just a bunch of people who know absolutely nothing. I went for my exam March 30, glasses came in 2 weeks later, tried them on and told the girl something is wrong. After 30 minutes going back and forth I was looking at them at different angles and swirls were in the lenses. Now flash forward to today go pick up replacements, put glasses on and see rainbows around everything. They take them to a tech to check says nothing wrong and I tell this girl again I’m seeing rainbows and she takes them back again to which she comes out and says the coating is defective. So now I am requesting replacement lenses again and she offers me to take them home to still try the prescription...uh I can’t even look through them and see clearly.</Review>

Took husband in for an appointment at 12. Didn't get in to do the exam until almost 2PM !!! Staff is very unprofessional, screaming back at each other and joking around. The over book people so you end up having to wait forever to even get seen! Definitely don't do the $78 deal because they make you choose your glasses from the value wall and they're all crap! Also takes 3 weeks to get them back! I don't recommend anyone go here.<//review>

<review>We hit some rough patches.  First optometrist gave too strong a prescription.  Exam done again.  My husband ordered two pair of glasses, one with transition lenses and most of the bells and whistles and a pair of sunglasses. Sunglasses were backordered but finally came in (5 weeks) and he thinks both pair are great.  Tayla was very pleasant and easy to work with.  We were given a pair of backup glasses for the inconvience between wrong prescription and backorder.  We are very pleased with the end product and will go back to this business.< /review>< pictures>

The worst place to get classes. I waited 6 hours with my 2 toddlers as the extremely incompetent optometrist (who apparently was a fill in) spent countless hours on one patient. When my turn finally came up he kept saying the machines weren't working and didn't k ow if he could give me my prescription. My wife had an appt too and he told her she had cataract. After the 6 hours I finally got seated for new glasses. The gentleman was nice enough to help with the cost since he saw me there for 6 hours waiting. After my wife got rechecked by a specialist and they couldn't understand why the optometrist has said cataract because there was absolutely nothing wrong with her eyes. Now it's a year later and my glasses are still under warranty. I took them back for new lenses since the coating came off the glass. When I went back a week later to pick them up, they had only put transition color on one lens. Can you believe that?! Who does that? I had to leave them and come back 3 hours later to pick them up. I like 45 mins away! After all that, I picked them up and brought them home. I get extremely nauseous wearing them. I called and now I have to bring them back again!!! Possibly wrong prescription or the bifocal line is too high!!! I hate this place!!! They do not know what they are doing!!!< /text>

<Review>First, when you make an appointment for an eye exam know that they double/triple book the slots so you might have to wait 90 minutes even though you have an appointment.
Second, after you pick your glasses and pay for them; please ensure one of the representatives doesn't put them in a cabinet that no one will look in. I went back when they were to be ready and no one had even touched them.
Lastly, if you pay for your glasses first then have your exam, please know that the system might mess up your prescription and they might put the wrong lenses in. After you put on the glasses and let the manager know they are not the right prescription. He will inform you that because you paid first before your exam the prescription didn't update correctly in the system after the exam. Applying that it is your fault the way they had you pay.

If want poor service and semi over priced glasses, please by all means run to this place.</Review>< Pictures>

I first noticed Stanton not only this one but others because of their adds on the front of the buildings. BOGO or 2 pairs for like $79 well these sound too good to be true and in a way they are. The promotional glasses aren't anything I would wear or anyone I know but the prices on the other frames are excellent. Glasses can be quite costly and I was very impressed with the prices and there is a huge selection.

I really would like to focus this review on this particular store. They have excellent customer service. I picked a few frames I liked on my own that were okay but then Tayla helped me find the ones that actually fit best for my face shape. Tayla was very knowledgeable and made me feel very comfortable with my choices. Brooke also helped me choose a second pair. I would also give store manager Mick a shoutout on having an excellent store with employees that went above and beyond. Thank you I will definitely be back.</Review>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Text>Short Review:  This place is a hustle don't be their mark.  Most if not all of the legitimate "Local Guides" give Stanton Optical Modesto a low or bad rating.  Beware of the 5 star reviews they're likely fake,  take notice how they have little or no previous review history.   Scroll for details.

I went to Stanton Optical 3200 Sisk Rd, Modesto for an eye exam with a prescheduled appointment made by Caleb who quoted a $79 exam fee.   I arrived on time there was already a number of people waiting to see the Optometrist.  After waiting 45 minutes past the exam appointment I was taken into the back office by Breanna and asked to pre-pay an exam fee of $89.00.  I let Breanna know Caleb had quoted $79.  She said they had just recently changed their pricing and left to ask Caleb if he was quoting $79 for exams.  Breanna returned with Tayla who was wearing a "manager in training" name tag and badge.  Tayla firmly restated the exam would be $89.  I made Tayla aware of the $79 exam quote from Caleb.  Tayla begrudgingly and with an attitude honored the $79 exam quote.
I finally sat down for the exam 1.5 hours past my scheduled appointment time.
The Optometrist Laila Osmaninejat was professional and I thought I received good care and unrushed service from her.  After the exam I was ushered into showroom to see Caleb waiting for me.  Caleb retrieved the new prescription on his terminal and proceeded to write down different eyewear options and costs on a dry erase mat reminiscent of used car sale tactics.  Caleb abrubtly left in the middle of this a number of times to answer ringing phones and hand off paper work and eyewear orders.   When Caleb returned he went into a pressurized sales act displaying the costs on his dry erase mat that were easily 300% more then I was accustomed to paying for eyewear.  I let Caleb know I would consider the offer but was late for another appointment and by that time I had been at Stanton Optical for 2 hours and had to get going.  Caleb barely acknowledged the comment and went into another sales offer.  I had to let him know again that I would consider the offers but needed to get going NOW.  He then sat at his desk another 5 minutes while I waited for a printout of my exam RX.  Caleb handed me a folded piece of paper and proceeded to ramble on with more sales offers as I opened and reviewed the paper.  The exam RX he had just handed me was incomplete and missing the optometrist signature.  I had to interrupt his sales pitch again to make him aware of the issues with the RX he just handed me.  Altogether it took 2 hours and 15 minutes to leave with a valid RX in hand.
Check your paperwork carefully before leaving.  Make sure everything with the RX is correct including the dates and the RX has the Optometrist signature.  Also the phone numbers listed on the RX are NOT in service and their fax machine does not work.  Calling in and faxing are common methods third parties use to verify an RX.
I would caution everyone to beware of Stanton Opticals showroom employees and management specifically Caleb their Optician, Tayla their Manager in Training and Mick their General Manager the one likely condoning and promoting these sales tactics and over inflated eyewear costs.  Stanton Optical's rag tag team of associates resembles an off strip casino pit crew of hard luck and cheap suits looking for marks to hustle.   Be hip to it, get the eye exam and make sure the RX is correct, ask for your near and far PD, which they're required to provide by law and then go fill somewhere else for way less $$$$.  If they go to far get in touch with the California Board of Optometry and file a complaint.  No doubt their pushing professional and ethical limits on a daily basis.  Good Luck.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

If I could rate zero stars I would! Such an unpleasant experience From the day I had the exam in January until now trying to re-order contacts! First, I was scheduled late, sat in the wait area for more than an hour, and then was told it was late and they would have to re-schedule with me another day..I took off early from work to do this and had request tine off AGAIN to do it again. The office manager was nice and offered a 20% discount, but it really didn’t make up for the inconvenience, especially because Modesto was out of my way. It was obvious the girls taking patient info and payment were new, but it was very unorganized and everyone seemed confused. I never received a call to let me know my contacts were ready for pick up, I had to call them. A few days after I left I noticed the prescription wasn’t signed by the doctor. Here we are May, need to re-order contacts, was told it would take 7-10 days. Unfortunately I can’t wait that long, my glasses are old and the prescription gives me a headache, all I want to do is get a copy of the prescription and buy a box of contacts to hold me over until my order is in. I call Stanton, spoke with a Breanna Welch (who btw didn’t want to tell me her name after I complained, but wasn’t smart enough to realize she emailed me the prescription from her email!) Brianna told me the doctor no longer worked there and I would have to come in for another eye exam WHAT!!!! She said she would email me the prescription, but what good is that if no one will take it because it’s not signed. I explain again how I can’t see and all I want to do is buy a box to hold me over, she goes onto explain if I got a trial pair when I went in the first time then they would t give me another pair. Again, it’s out of my way and I can’t just drive there to be told they can’t give me a trial pair, so I ask her if she can look.  She looks in the system and says she can’t see that I was issued a trial pair, and then later says they don’t record if a trial pair was given out. This chick is stupid and says one thing then another..I think she memorized lines and just says whatever sounds good at the time, clearly can’t remember what she says from one minute to the next. I call Walmart to see if they would take the copy without the signature, I wasn’t surprised they wouldn’t. Walmart Optical in Tracy was very helpful, she told me the Medical Board of California made a law that allowed another doctor to sign the prescription and to call Stanton Optical back, let them know that and demand that they have a doctor sign it..even she said Stanton is trying to make it hard on me!! Here we go again...I call Stanton Optocal back, they won’t tell me who I spoke with, I get placed on hold and a few minutes later someone gets back on the line and totally mixes me up with another customer, providing me details of whatever this other person is talking about! So I explain my situation again and tell them I just got off the phone with Walmart and I tell her about this law and that I just want the prescription signed.  Instead, she tells me she’s going to check if trials are available...I don’t want the damn trials from this store...I want my damn prescription I paid for!! She tells me a doctor wouldn’t sign another doctors exam because they have to be the one doing the exam..I tell her about this law again. After more arguing with her I’m told they will have another doctor look at it tomorrow when there is a doctor there, but I need to call and try to get in touch with her..No Way!! I work too, I can’t call on a hit or miss, I demand they leave my name and a message and have the doctor call me at her convenience, this girl continues to argue with me until I tell her how bad their customer service is and I’m going to get in contact with someone to complain, she then says she’ll have the doctor call me. What a joke!! I hate this place, everything about it has been difficult, unorganized and unethical!!! A doctor better call me back tomorrow and this better get taken care of or I am filing a complaint with the board!!!!</Text>

<Text>Never again will I go to this location. When I went on the 12th of June I paid cash for the 2 pair of glasses , then was told they would be ready on the 14th by 5 p.m.
I called to see if they were ready and they said yes. I get to the store and informed they wont be ready till the 26th.
I am with my husband that is an otr truck driver and would not be able to get back on the 26th . The only pair ready for me were the sunglasses on the 14th.
Told them I would have to wait till middle of July.
Called on 26th and the person I spoke to said my glasses were at the store.
I go to store today 7/16/18 and they tell me they haven't been received yet.
Price sounds good but as saying goes you get what you pay for.<//Text><Response>None<//Response><user>101164950466315227907<//user></record></dataset><record>

I had a great experience here !  Thank you to Dr. Springer & Mo! They definitely have 100% Satisfaction guaranteed! Customer for Lifee !
**So I would like to edit this review because it’s only fair that I Be Truly honest about my experience. I did experience a good visit with Dr Springer . I only wrote this review because dr.Mo asked me to at the end of my Appt . I felt pressured to do so as he said I’m going to check and see if you wrote the review. And even suggested what be written  . Other than that i had a ok experience.< /Text>

The "free pair" they pawn off on you are sadly better quality than the overpriced initial pair you purchase. Between poor quality, unsatisfactory customer service, and a ridiculously long turn around time this company is not worth the "savings!"</review>< pics>

Terrible service, I ordered two pairs of glasses and was told repeatedly that they were ready to pick up when in fact they were not! Price was over the roof too! $375 for two pairs of simple glasses is absurd! Clean atmosphere but the employees were unprofessional and uninformative.<//text>

Tayla and Rubin were great! Rubin welcomed me in and after browsing for a few he came and asked how i was doing. Offered to help and brought me a case to keep the frames i liked in. Was in and out of my eye exam. Tayla then assisted me by picking out the final pair. And was very kind and patient while seaeching through all their selections.They also worked with me and my budget to get the perfect pair. I would come back. Thanks you guys!< /review>

I don’t write many reviews on anything but I felt that  Stanton optical at 3200 Sisk Rd. Modesto CA and to be more specific Mick Shafer deserve to get a great review.

I originally had scheduled an appointment for an eye exam for contacts but due a combination of issues I was going to arrive late to the appointment, I called what I thought was the actual location but later found out it was a call center to inform them I was going to arrive late, the representative advised me that it shouldn’t be a problem to go ahead and just show up.... long story short I arrived after the Doctor had left missing my appointment.

I was very frustrated and almost didn’t give them a second chance.... this is where Mick Shafer comes in. Mr. Shafer noticed I was upset and he calmly asked if there was anything he could do and if there was he would gladly do it. I told Mr. Shafer I would have to really think about considering making a second appointment. As an insensitive he gave me his personal contact from the office and asked that if I reconsidered to give him a call directly.

After a day and really thinking it through I felt Mr. Shafer was being genuine and I took inconsideration his great customer service in dealing with some one as difficult as me and decided to call to reschedule an appointment.

Mr. Shafer went above and beyond what I expected and what I believe is one of the best experiences I’ve had with any business period.

So to that Thank you Mick Shafer.< /review>

<text>would you like to wear glasses that don't match your prescription?
want them done six times, over a time period of six months?
would you like your warranty to mean relatively nothing but having to deal with these people over and over again?
would you like to talk to a store manager who brushes you off because he doesn't want to hear complaints about the horrible customer service?
would you like your glasses broken by a member of his staff?
would you like to be force fed excuses afterwards, with no sincere apology?
want a horrible attitude while having to deal with ALL OF THIS?

then stanton's the place for you.</text><Time>1372042142647</Time>< user>

If I can give this place ZERO STARS I would. I DO NOT RECOMMEND This place to anyone! WORST SERVICE EVER. I got charged $39 TWICE for my "FREE EYE EXAM" the first time I didn't get a receipt (I guess that's my fault for trusting LAUREN the one who took my payment both times. I handed her a $100 bill and she handed me back 60 something back I sat down waiting to be called and put my money back in my wallet, she stated that would go towards my glasses I said "ok". Second time she called me to pay the $39 again she said that was goin towards my pre test. I said "ok" again and handed her $40 and she gave me a dollar back. Mind you before I came to my appointment I called 3 times to MAKE SURE the most I'd be paying was $70-$80 (they said YES ALL TIMES. For "FREE EYE exam and 2 pairs of glasses for $59.99). I got my eye exam and the lady that did it was wonderful very very nice. I went out and chose my glasses. When I was finished I waited at the desk for awhile till someone in a white coat came to help me. She helped me choose a second pair and when we sat down I asked if I paid for my glasses since I just paid the $39 both times which came out to $78 she said no she only has a record of me paying once which was a lie. That means Lauren pocketed my money the first time or did something with it. My glasses came out to $400!!! I am a mother of one, expecting another in November and cannot afford $400 for glasses with rent and bills AND A BABY COMING! I spoke to the manager and he said I'd have to wait 20 minutes for Lauren to get back from her lunch so I did, I was getting irritated, I was hungry, and started crying as I sat there because I am broke as it is, and don't mind paying the $78 for my glasses with my FREE eye exam that's why I went in the first place. After that 20 minutes was up I went to the desk asked to speak to him again I was gonna let them know I couldn't wait, well some other guy who said he was "higher then all of them" came out looked in the computer opened the register and pulled out a stack of ONES barely counted it and said "everything is all there, payments match what's in the system". That pissed me off I had tears in my eyes so basically he's calling me a liar and when I asked to speak to Lauren he wouldn't let me because he was "higher than her" and it "wouldn't solve anything". All I wanted was my $39 back!! I asked if he could look in the cameras and he said they didn't have any where the register was, only in the lobby. So I asked if he could look in the lobby where I was sitting because I walked out with my change and put it back In my wallet when I sat down and he said there was none pointed to where I was sitting. SMFH. At this point I'm furious literally SHAKING. He sat there with a smirk on his face saying "I don't know what you did with the money you don't have" I'm so upset I just lost out on $39!!!! I have never ever in my LIFE dealt with such rude people, and not to mention the fact that after when Lauren seen me she ran in the bathroom. Now if I wasn't pregnant I would have gotten ghetto on that ass real quick! But im sensitive and emotional and can't do much. I just want my money back. Like what do you get for stealing from customers!!!!? This is the worst eye drs I have ever been too, and I wish I would have gotten the managers name becausd this was so unprofessional. I have a family, I have kids I have to feed and clothe, bills I have to pay, I dont have money to just throw around. Not to mention I'm super blind and still didn't get my glasses n that's $40 taken from the next place I have to order glasses from. I'm so mad.<//text>

<pictures>None< /pictures><Text>Wow ! Wasted 1 hour and 40 minutes. I hate this place! When I came in to get my eye exam n contact lenses done. I was using my Vsp blue anthem covers eye exam if you all don't know that. Dr. Was great and I came out to get my prescription the manager said you have a co pay ok. I will pay it and can I get my prescription, he than said no you have to pay the $79 for eye exam. My eye s have allergic reaction so I will try them on and if it suits my eye I will come back. Still say no pay $79 for eye exam. But the office inside said I m covered. I will NEVER come back to this place! Costco gave me my eye exam for free covered by my insurance and gave me my prescription same day. And yes I went back to get my contact lenses. I needed my prescription for DMV! Wow. The manager Jonathan says something else. The boss says am covered !  Bad bad bad experience. The front dest in the exam room n the doctor is great thou!    Yes. Please download Groupon if u want discount on your glasses here. I will complain to the business bureau !!!!!<//Text><name>Belinda Randhawa< /name><UserId.>100884539884148804124< /UserId.><rating>1< /rating><time>1504399491409</time>< Resp>

<Text>These guys are great been going to Lens Crafters for years but made the switch today. I'm getting the eye surgery and needed a inexpensive pair of glasses so I can properly be fitted. Lens crafters wanted $200 and I would have to wait 7 days there guys did itmuch cheaper and I got the glasses in 15 minutes. Special thank you to Brian and Eyan for helping me. They went out of their way to help me and made me feel they cared.</Text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Called today and made a 5:30 appointment.
I left work early. Got here to Sisk Rd location and was told I did not have an appt. Showed them in my phone records that I had called and was told the number listed on their website is not the right number and is Stockton location. I was specifically told my appt was at 5:30 on Sisk and Standiford.
I have now been waiting 45 minutes. Not happy. If I was not out of contacts and RX was not outdated.... I would take my business elsewhere.<//Text>< Response>

I regret giving my money to this place. Hidden fees on fees on fees.. After buying 2 pairs at $270 (with coupons/discounts) my pair broke less than 6 months later. 1 year warranty on lenses and 2 years on frames, so I went back to have them replaced at "No charge". After going back not only was I told I had to buy a whole new pair, only thing that was taken off was original frame price $39 towards my $79 New frame not including lenses I had to pay more than I did for my original Glasses. I will no longer give this place my Business and doubt it's hurting them nor do they seem to care. *I Just want to put this out there for others who don't make the same mistake as i did and dish out hella money for crappy customer service (phone reps) & No guarantee warranties. I will shop Costco Optical or online at Zenni Optical 😊< /review>< Pictures>

Literally the WORST phone etiquette and customer service I have EVER dealt with. I actually had gone to Stanton Optical a few months ago to purchase contact lenses. I am used to places having them in stock and I did not realize they didn't there. The man who helped me failed to mention that and when he said it would be about 2 weeks naturally I was surprised. When I simply asked, "You don't keep them in stock?" I got a rude retort about how they couldn't POSSIBLY keep all the contacts brands and all the prescriptions in stock. When I said I didn't really want to wait two weeks for contacts I wasn't sure I was even going to like and I was having to buy a 6month supply.  He once again very rudely told me that they had an eye doctor there on site and if I did an eye exam they would give me a trial pair. I said that would be great and he responded with, "Well you know you have to PAY for it right?" Seriously? You have to pay for eye exams??? I had no idea!! Yes I knew I would have to pay for it and I did not appreciate his rude comments. Now I could understand if I had came in wearing sweats with unwashed hair and looked like I had been living on the streets, but I was on my lunch break from work where I work as an Account Executive! I had slacks, a nice shirt and coat, heels and my hair and makeup done! So to continue... I ask how long it would take and when their next appointment was (fully expecting to have to wait a day or more) he tells me they have one right that sec. I ask again how long it would take because I was on my lunch break. He told me it shouldn't take longer than 30 mins. I said ok that's great and he walked me into the optometrist part of the building. Says I am there for a contact exam and walks out. The woman behind the counter asks if I have an appointment  and I tell her no that the gentleman who was just helping me told me that they had an opening. She kind of huffs and says well our next opening for a walk in is in 45 mins! I explained that I was told you would take me in right away and that I was on my lunch break. She now gets very rude and says, " well we have to help the people who actually MADE appointments before we could get you in." I said I understood that and that I had fully intended to make an appointment, but the gentleman who had helped me said there was no need that they had one right away. She asked if I would like to make an appointment and I said no thank you I do not have time for these sales games and I walked out! How am I supposed to know more than what I am told by the sales rep?!

Ok so flash forward about 4 months and my prescription has now officially expired. I need to schedule an exam and even though with my last experience with Stanton Optical I was a little hesitant, but with them being the cheapest without vision insurance and they actually had an appointment I decided to try. The experience while in the store wasn't bad. Everyone was extremely helpful and courteous. I ended up ordering the buy one get on "free" glasses with a "free" exam after I had my exam. They don't really go over the numbers or explain things very well when they do sit down and are talking to you about it. I was already hesitant because I wasn't in love with either of the glasses, but they were the only ones I found that I was remotely ok with. I tell the lady as much as I need glasses I really don't want to spend the $366 on them right now. She tells me well you can do a partial payment and only pay $183 right now and the rest when you pick them up. I decided to go ahead and do that. When I receive my receipt as I'm walking out I am looking at it and the numbers aren't adding up for this "free" pair of glasses. This "free" pair of glasses added another almost $120 to the bill. Now I am getting frustrated again because of their horrible shady sales tactics because they do not show you what you are paying for when you agree.. There is just this paper they circle some stuff and they randomly put a number down then they use a calculator and you have no idea what they are calculating.. To be continued</text>

<Review>I actually haven't even had an appt yet... & I wouldn't even give them 1 star... I schedule an appointment for my husband for last Friday at 6 p.m... they called at 5:30 to see if he can come in earlier... I told them no because he was getting off of work in turlock at 5:30pm & I would not have time & they kept suggesting for him to come in earlier & again said there would be no time... After being stuck on the Standiford Ave over pass for 10 mins I called them at 6pm exactly & told them we were at the lights... They put me on hold & when they came back on the line at 6:03 we had already been parked & getting down from the car then the receptionist came back on the line & said the Dr have already left the office... I told her it is 6:03 how is it that they already left  when we have been out here 2 mins & our appt was 3 mind ago... It was ridiculous... They wanted him in earlier because they wanted to leave early on a Friday... They should have never scheduled the appointment then... Bad maybe worse experience & he hadn't even seen the Dr yet...<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x8090504b9dfe308f:0x4de296d70fe5582f<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<rating>5<//rating><review>I have not had a pair of glasses or contacts for a couple years and my eyesight was beginning to get worse.. I was referred to Stanton Optical by a really good friend. I entered with out expectation of any sort, just simply to find a pair of glasses to enhance my eyesight. The optometrist was super nice and very helpful to my eye health. After the appointment I was told to choose 2 pairs of glasses because one of them was going to be free. That was start number 2 to my awesome experience. I chose the glasses that I felt where a great fit for myself. As I sat down with one of the sales associates she reviewed everything for with me and listed all the benefits. Unfortunately it was a little out of my price range but she was willing to speak to a manager to see what can be worked out. I appreciated her eagerness and great service and that's what gets them the 3rd star. I was really happy with the service that I received, yet still a little anxious about the price I would have to pay, I left the store and had time to think it through and decided to give them a call. The young lady I spoke to was super nice and encouraged me to return so that I am able to work something out that meets my financial needs. I returned, as I walked in I was greeted by Brent, the sales manager, I explained the issue and he was able to let Brandon, the general manager, know about my situation. Brandon was extremely helpful and quick to figure out how he was able to help. He kept a smile on his face the entire time and made me feel comfortable with the issue that I had. In the end of it all Brandon exceeded my expectations in helping as best as he could. With that experience alone is where I feel the earned the 4th star. BUT I give them 5 stars due to me having such a great experience and having my glasses ready less than 5 days after my appt. They went above and beyond what they should have.

<Review>An awful experience. Almost 3 weeks to get my glasses. When I finally told them to cancel my order, the glasses mysteriously appeared an hour later. No apologies until after the fact. And while a couple of the girls were friendly, the over all customer service was a joke. Save yourself some time and go somewhere else….anywhere else…..<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

I gave Stanton a one star so I could leave a comment. I have never went to a place before where I was treated so wrong I was told my glasses would be ready in two weeks it took them over a month to get them back and the lady that was adjusting them broke them so I waited another month and got them in they were to tight on my face wrong size and the second pair was sunglasses and they were messed up. Had to wait again for six weeks and I wanted a refund and was told I couldn't get one but they would give me half off the next time I got glasses. I went in yesterday to get a new nose piece and the guy bent my frames and now I have to go back and get them fixed I live two towns over and it's an inconvenience to keep going back. The commercial on TV said two pairs of glasses for $78 and my total was $545 but was quoted $300 and was given that discount. It's false advertising to get you into the store and the people in Modesto don't know what they are doing they always have new people in there and they don't help you and you wait forever on the phone on hold and in person. Don't go there and I'm never going there again. I've heard the same story before and others worse about Stanton Optical in Modesto California. I give them a negative five stars.<//Text>

<text>I went here to come in as a walk in because I needed contacts and no where else taking a walk in. Luckily they saw me but that is the last time I wait till the last minute. There is long waits plan on being there 2-3 hours. There is a sign in sheet which they don't go by unless it's slow. One of the employees got into an argument with a customer and hell broke lose where the employee was going to call the police. It was both their fault over not dispensing on Sunday's even though all other employees where dispensing. I was sent back and forth from and waited for an hour just so I can get my prescription. Then was told that the doctor handles that and I explained to them that the doctor told me to go to the front entrance and wait and they would bring it and have them sign it. She was ready to send me off to the doctors office until I had enough and just told her to take care of it. I would come here again only if I was in dire need of contacts but I would rather be partially blind.<//text>< Name>

Cheap quality!. I paid $500 for 2 pairs one was "FREE" - Nothing is free it was included with the $500!  which I never put on because I wasn't happy even after I took it in and it was "FIXED". One of the frame arms got loose after one month of usage on the pair I'm using for both driving and reading. Very expensive for the poor quality and not returning back to this vendor.<//review>

Worst customer service, ever. They do not listen to the customer, don't fix problems and try to blame the customer for issues. Almost $300 for glasses that have had nothing but problems.</review>

After waiting over a month and a half, i got a pair of glasses that still do not work right,these are the worst people to deal with, i guess they are only good for single vision glasses, do not think you will get a pair of progressives that will work for you, i am considering a class action law suit!<//review>

There was a general lack of professionalism throughout the store, and an unwarranted air of superiority. It wasn't busy when I went in, but we still waited for much longer than was necessary, despite the several employees standing idle throughout the store.
Lenscrafters isn't too far, and is much better. I will not be doing business with Stanton again.<//review>
