<Rate>5< /Rate><review>Jacob was the installer. He arrived in time, was very professional and respectful. Came in with proper mask. Jacob got right to work and had my Range Hood and Cooktop installed in under two hours! He cleaned up and even threw out the boxes that the appliances came in. He new exactly what he was doing. I was very impressed with the service as well as with the scheduling and keeping me informed via email and chat in Yelp. Also, you can’t beat the cost! You need to call My Install Guy first to see how very competitive they are in pricing. Others wanted to charge me up to $300 dollars more than My Install Guy! Thank you for your excellent service!<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>{'time': 1613674416000, 'text': 'Thank you for the positive review James.

If you really want it done to perfection?  My Install Guy is who you want to do your install! ...Ken is a perfectionist hands down!  he takes his time and will not! rush your project! and his goal is to make you go WOW! after the job is completed !  We could have not found a better install for our bathroom vanity.  I can understand why he is so recommended by the major players like Home Depot and Lowes ... Truly a top notch install! and yes! these are real pictures from our home.</Review>

Booked Install services through Lowe’s for a higher end range hood. Jacob was extremely professional and knowledgeable. Not only did he do a great job on Install but he also gave some great tips and advice on how best to enjoy the new hood. Would definitely book again.<//Review>

After a brief check of where the Microwave would be installed, he began placing items to protect the Range and other surfaces in the Kitchen where he might need to lay tools or parts.  He removed the old item, and step by step installed the new microwave.  He tested it, checked all the lights and controls, and asked if my wife and I had any questions.  He cleaned up the work area, and left nothing except a new microwave and two happy home owners.
If you are contemplating purchasing an item from Lowe's which needs to be installed you will find this service a 5 Star Operation as indicated.
It was obvious watching him that he knew what he was doing.  I was impressed with his attention to detail.  It was obvious he had done this before.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< GmapID>

Kevin was my installer,  he was 30 minutes early. He was professional and friendly.  My old dishwasher wasn't easy to get out. He was patient ,  persistent and respectful of my wood flooring.  The 45 minute install ended up almost 2 hours because of the removal of the old unit.  I honestly think another installer would have said they couldn't complete the job.  Kevin is an amazing asset to your company.  I would request him for future jobs.  Thank you for the amazing job!!!< /Review><Date>1564249623481< /Date><pictures>None<//pictures>< username>

No parking, no bathrooms, and only one water fountain. Disadvantages aside, this is a nice park on the good side of town. It is suitable for quick outings, but if you have kids chances are you won't be there long before someone has to go pee.<//Text>

I'm going to say that this park and just about every single park beside Plaza park, Whitendale park, and Blain park have a bathroom. This message to the public beware of the city of Visalia is about to take all the bathroom in our neighborhood parks. There is outlets for the park's, but they're not turned on.  Thank God for piece of mind and heart that my children were exposed to an older day in time when I gave them compassion, love, respect for family values and humble heart. My son has had a medical emergency use of the bathroom. The dog's have been given poop bags. In the Rotary Park no bathrooms, just doggie poopbags.< /Review>

Pequeño pero muy lindo y tranquilo con los juegos necesarios y especiales, lo unico que le falta a este lugar son luces por las noches.< /review>< response>

<Review>We  ordered several kind of food for 5 people. The taste was good. The service is Absolute 0. Inside  of the restaurant was like a storage. Be ready to pay 3 times of the menu prices. Maybe they add 40% tax or maybe 40 or 50% service fee. I never go there again.<//Review>< user_name>

<rating>1</rating><text>This is one of the craziest experiences I've ever had. There was literally a metal wire cooked in my chicken. PLEASE see the picture. I was taken back when I pulled it out my mouth. This was bad, but not as bad as the customer service when I called to complain. The person who answered the phone refused to let me speak to a manager and said this is the first time anyone complained about this so not a big deal. It's not a big deal that I could of choked and died for eating a piece of Orange Chicken with a metal wire cooked in it. I said have the manager call me because this is not ok. He took my number down and said I don't know if he will call you as he doesn't know when the manager will be in next. I really don't care, I have time for this. Still waiting.<//text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOQQgEsRHaxnKpdh8-gABph5xExCnTn_-c1WyBa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNle8SUaJoaKxunjd5F9EO5-L8QYkq1Co1BvlNc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< Resp>

<Text>This popped up as a new place on Yelp and we went to try it. I haven't left a yelp review in forever but I came back on to rave about how delicious this place is. The steamed buns are the best I've ever had- the flavor is spectacular, with the slightest little crisp on the bottom. It's perfection. The staff is so kind and doting and I can't wait to make this a regular spot!</Text>< rating>

Great Hong Kong style Chinese food in Chinatown. Good to see new Chinese business actually coming back in Chinatown. Great selection of food, including Egg Waffles. We got the Chef's special: Shrimp Fried Rice in Pineapple, with includes an actual Pineapple!!! Prices are a bit higher compare to other Chinese restaurant but their food is great tasty and their restaurant environment is clean.< /text>

Highly recommend this place! It has saved me from having to trek all the way to SGV for authentic Chinese food.

Ordered 3 dishes to takeaway and loved every single one! The salt and pepper pork was well seasoned and crispy, and the cuts of meat were not super fatty which I have found more often than not at other places with this dish. The hainan chicken rice was so flavourful and the chicken was so soft. The beef chow fun had the right amount of ‘wok’ fried taste and lots of pieces of beef.< /Review>

I've been coming here for years, since I was young.  The absolute best time to come is for an early dinner before 4PM and order from the lunch menu.  This a deal and get a great amount of food.

Their prices are very reasonable and food is always outstanding!  It's a Valley Must Have!</review>

Chinese food and the atmosphere at this location is excellent. I've had nothing but great experiences here and will keep coming back. Prices were fair for the quality of the food. Ambience is similar to Fresno's scene.<//Review>

The food isn't really authentic.

We wanted to try their milk tea, we asked them if the milk tea is Hong Kong style, none of them could give me a definite answer - and of course, one said it is and we trusted him but it turned out it's not at all.

The Hainanese Chicken rice wasn't really Hainanese to be honest, it was Scallion Oil Chicken rice at best.< /Text>

Great restaurant! But it wasn't a 5. Staffs were nice and foods were fast. It was cheap too! We ordered three dishes: scrambled eggs with shrimps, fried crispy sole, and beef short ribs. They were all good. The parking lot was $5 all day, but you could find parking on the street. I left slightly before 8pm and the parking attendant was gone so you could park for free when dining late!</Review>

Excellent food. Super friendly staff. I watched one waiter go outside into the pouring rain to take a photo of a group of elderly ladies having dinner together because he wanted to get the decor in the photo and that was the best angle for his vision. But don't let that undersell the food. The food was amazing.</text>

<review>Delicious!  This place used to be a family favorite until we moved out of the area.  I hadn't been here for a few years and made my way back this weekend.  The food was just as good as it used to be if not better.  The salt and pepper crab was one of the best I've ever had and also the smoked duck.  I'll definitely be coming back again soon.< /review>< response>

East Garden is a Chinese restaurant that offers Cantonese cuisine in the Guangzhou style. This four star rating is for their breakfast menu only, which is both fairly inexpensive and excellent: highly recommended are the beef rolls which consists of beef inside an almost crepe like wrapping of rice noodle. Another recommendation is their beef stew noodles soup, which has an excellent broth with chunks of beef, rice noodles and bok choy. They have a homemade spicy chili oil condiment which is great and works well with their soups.
As for the lunch and dinner menu, it is mostly forgettable.. honestly, I would give it two to three stars at best. Much of the dinner menu isn't great, some of it is less than fresh. BTW, vegetables are expensive here compared to their competition.
Service is fine. The owner is most often present.<//Text>

Was visiting LA for the first time, wanted some good food. Just got done with Griffith Park googled and  stumbled over “East garden” restaurant in Chinatown. Food was great, service was great, it was prepared fast, and was very clean and they were friendly. I  recommend the Hawaiian fish and shrimp and it wasn’t expensive at all 👍<//Text>

This is a Cantonese restaurant and is pretty mediocre quality but their daily specials is cheapest in Chinatown.

The $4 Wonton noodle soup with shrimp inside  is amazing deal.  Is not better than Sam woo but is a lot cheaper.

However their service just not good, understaff and very slow.  My order came after like 25 minutes. After despite I was here before the other diner who we order the same thing.  A lot lunch diner come here are office worker so wait like this and service is make them don’t wanna returnsZ. Food is decent is affordable but is service is what I dislike here.< /review>

It's been a while since a new actual chinese non hipster restaurant opened in Chinatown.  This place is serving casual chinse food at great prices.  No, it's not the best Chinese food out there, but it is still delicious and value priced.

The shrimp wonton noodle soup was on special for 4.50 and the I was surprised by the amount of shrimp used in the wonton.  When I don't want to make the trek to sgv, this place will definitely be my cheap go to chinse spot.</Text>

<rate>5< /rate><review>So I was in Chinatown with family and someone was handing out menus on the street.  We asked the guy handing out the menu about the restaurant.  He said they were new and had only been open a couple of weeks.  So we walked around for a while and when it was time to eat we decided to give this place a try.  The restaurant is designed in a modern style.  It is very clean.  So we ordered.  We ordered Shrimp Rolls, Lo Mein, Fried Rice, Kung Pao Chiken, and The Hot and Sour Soup.

I wanted fried shrimp.  It’s a staple with my family and they suggested the shrimp rolls, which are essentially shrimp rolled ip in a pastry dough or maybe wonton wrapper, but let me say this, Delicious.  They were served in a mason jar with sauce on the side.  The only thing they didn’t have was hot mustard, but it’s ok.  They were still really good.

This was the opening to the rest of the dinner,  the rice was great, Kung pao mmmm, lo mein was great and the soup was good.

I live in LA and my family and I eat Chinese on a regular basis.  There isn’t a lot of good Chinese food in Los Angeles proper and we usually go to West Hollywood to the Kung Pao Bistro or the the Inland Empire to the China Point or if we are feeling like we want true hardcore Chinese food we head to Alhambra to Chengdu.

Well the East Garden is now on my list of favorite spots.  Plus it’s like 1/2 mike from my house.  The waiters were very attentive, the place was clean, the food was fresh and delicious.  There is a big parking lot in front or you can park across the street in the big lot on Hill St.

Turns out the guy handing out the menus is the owner.  You need to try this place it will be on your list of favorite restaurnts, overall.< /review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

(Translated by Google) The light in China Town, diagonally in front of the door, is a parking place where you can park for 7 dollars. Now have a nice dinner, we came in, were allowed to find a place for ourselves. Menu card viewed what a choice. They are large portions, view the pictures that says enough. Family M & m have had a super delicious meal here, see our vlog on YouTube.

It's in China Town, a parking lot is in front off the restaurant, Parking 7 Dollars.
You can eat well here, what you will it is big. Just see the picture below ..
Watch is on YouTube Family M&M, family vloggers.

I love the guangdong food. They make authentic guangdong food.
Very authentic Cantonese cuisine, the roast duck soup in the inside makes me amazing! Recommend this restaurant. It is rare to eat authentic dishes that have not been assimilated by the United States in the country!

(Translated by Google) Home warm but the portions are very large. We ordered 5 courses and the waitress did not even anticipate that the amount was huge. Especially since the dishes are fat and we missed one. The service was deceived flat, did not seek to apologize and still leave it.

(Original)
Accueil Chaleureux mais les portions sont très grandes. Nous avons commandé 5 plats et la serveuse ne nous a même pas prévu que la quantité était énorme. D'autant plus que les plats sont gras et qu'ils nous en manqué un. Le service s'étant trompé de plat, n'a pas cherché à s'excuser et l'a quand meme laisser.< /Review>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><Text>The financial services department is so incompetent. I requested a W9 from them because my employer agreed to help pay part of my medical bill. Tell me why after 5 calls, 5 hours and 3 different representatives I still haven’t received the W9 I requested.

One of them told me that they couldn’t disclose that information to me because it was confidential and the other one told me she would get it to me within the hour and 5 hours later I still haven’t gotten it. I’m literally trying to pay them money and they are treating me like I don’t even matter. It’s literally one form that takes 30 seconds to scan over.

Let me tell you they didn’t have a problem sending me my bill and denying my financial assistance because I was over 600 dollars because of my increased unemployment benefits.

This hospital is the worst. Their customer service is the worst. Do yourself a favor and take yourself anywhere else if you have a non emergency medical need.< /Text><name>Adrian Licea</name><userid>103657138185247905402< /userid>< Response>

That's creepy! There is no doubt that there are good doctors and nurses who works here... but there are lazy bad doctors/nurses aswell who are more concerned about their salary than patients' welfare. And, that's creepy! We had chance to let the nursing supervisors Pam & Claudia know about my cousin, but was ignored, and we were told to call patient relation at 8pm. We're stirring clear next time.<//Text>

Valley Memorial has mixed reviews but I've always found that they have taken care of me and my family over the years. 4 stars instead of 5 because I feel like the facility could be better maintained but the medical staff is very good. Best in the area. I would recommend Valley Memorial over Natividad any day.< /Text>

Staff are rude, noisy and unprofessional. My son was there for almost a week and a half with almost zero improvement. Staff did not make it a priority when he would call for help. Sometimes my son had to call out staff as they walked passed his room because his calls for his nurse were ignored..... Still no help, they would just say "your nurse will come in a bit" and then they would close his door. After 10 days at SVMH we decided to go to a different hospital. In less than 3 days my son is 80% better. Why is that you ask. Well because he is now in a place where they care about the patient's healing and wellbeing.

Not sure why my son was treated this way? Did it have to do with his Medical Insurance? With Ethnicity?

<Review>I'm just wondering what is going on with Memorial hospital a friend went there not that long ago and was diagnosed with kidney failure.  She there 5 days then transferred to hospice for dialysis she waited for the dialysis treatment to begin and 2 days later after no one paid any attention to her she couldn't take it anymore and left to take care of some unfinished business.  A week later concerned about her life she returned to Memorial hospital to explain what happened so they went to pull the medical records for that dos and they did not exist like she was never there. So they retested her again and found nothing wrong with her.  What the...

Another went to the ER for a migraine.  They administered the medicine through an iv which was weird since she always got one on her hip.  She never saw the doctor.  She waited hours with the iv stuck in her arm for someone to come remove the iv and release her. After 7 hours of waiting she left. Later they called looking for her and told her they were concerned because she still had the iv in her arm and that they were just about to go in there to give her the test results. She told them "What test results you didn't take any samples of blood or urine from me I went in for a migraine and was given the medicine through an iv but no one ever returned to remove it so i left"

It wasn't busy and nurses kept passing by and can see her waiting in the room.  She got dressed and passed by the nurses and front desk and walked out and the security was the only one that acknowledge her leaving by saying good night.

I always had good service there and was shocked to hear this and now I'm hesitant to go there in the future.

Sorry Memorial hospital but you need to check your staff or let them rest or something.</Review>< pictures>

Went in for food stuck in throat, I sat in waiting room for over 8hrs.  Finally a doctor performed a 20Min. procedure to remove food stuck in my throat and received an $11,000+ bill for the procedure.  Do they charge for 8-9 hours of sitting in the waiting room.  Paid the Doctor, Anesthesiologist, but Never paid Hospital for ripping me off, went on my credit score...turned over to collections.<//review>

I think they murdered my dad. Something doesn't add up with how he went. After a web call that my dad text me saying that they tried to put him to sleep and freaked out on a video web call, his health declined fast. One day they say he was going to be released in about 3 day because he was doing well then after the video call  his health declined and he passed away. My dad was strong and was well aware of things. I think they murdered him.<//text>

Went to ER and I don't feel good. I had head pain. Dr Ramos was in charged at the time. I could remember that he was yelling at me asking for my info but I was so dizzy and can barely talked. Dr Ramos ordered blood work and discharge me. A week later, my Pcp Doctor ordered an MRI and found that I suffered Mild Stroke. Will pursue Legal means soon.< /Text>

<review>I had a great experience. All intake people were professional and the nurse was so kind. My nurse Jennifer Carlquist brought me a blanket she was checking on me she was gentle with me and explained everything. My doctor Stehmeier, Ian D was on point very efficient and listened well to how I was feeling and what treatment I didn’t want to do. She was gentle and explained things well and showed respect and care.<//review>< Pictures>

<text>It’s a great place. The people there are nice and the entire place looks clean.
But I am picking about their Farmers Market. There’s a lot of people who use cards and the businesses there don’t accept card. They should only accept business that accept cash and card. If not, then what’s the point to go there. The next time I go there and I get the same thing, I won’t shop there again< /text>< pictures>

I called last night about doing a covid test, they said no appointment needed they are open from 9-5. My husband and I show up at 940 and the lady asked us why are you here. First of all rude! We said my husband's coworker was tested positive and we need a negative test to go back to work. She said we can't get a test because it's appointment only!! I called the hospital to then set up an appointment and they again told me its not by appointment!!<//Text>

<review>The quality of medical care was great! They gave her the medication that actually reversed her symptoms and she is no longer afraid of what was happening to her.

The only issues my mother encountered were a lack of updated medical communication between the medical staff, the attendants and the patient.

One issue in particular was that no one informed my mother that she can custom order her meals as an overnight in-patient.

Another issue in particular was not being allowed to use the restroom while in ICU and being scolded for attempting to use the restroom by herself.< /review>< Pics>

<text>Patient beware! Check prices online before using hospital services. Often very large difference between SVMH and other providers (think thousands for the same procedure). The prices are available online, per requirement, but they do not notify that there are available nor what any of the charges will be at the time of service. I was only made aware of the outrageous charges when the bill was mailed.</text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

<Text>I went into the e.r with chest pain, I have to say I wasnt very happy with the hospital in the past. This time was so much better. Not only did they save my life but everyone was so kind and caring. I had amazing doctors but the most amazing nurses. I wish I could name all of them but there was some foggy parts during my care. I can say stephany, linda and Margaret  where absolutely amazing. I can never show my gratitude for all that you have done. And to the male nurse who kept checking on me, thank you. It helps to see a friendly face of these people, who truly cared. Stay safe and again thank you for all your hard work. Sherry okamoto</Text>< Pictures>

I went to the E.R on 8-19-19 because my Stanford doctors told me to go to my closes E.R when I got their I saw they had a full house lots of patients but I still walked in and gave my name to the security guy who was signing in people he told me it would be a few minute I told him it was fine as long as I was seen but I also told him I couldn’t be near a lot of people because my Immune system is low he told me I would have to wait outside I then saw a nurse and I tried to explain my situation that I had cancer and I couldn’t be near a lot of people that I didn’t mind waiting but that I wasn’t going to wait outside because their was no chair outside. She told me they had lots of patients and that I would have to wait to be seen I told her “ I understand but I can’t be near a lot of people due to my immune system being low since I have cancer and I don’t want to be standing outside ” I didn’t mind waiting which I told them numerous times but I wanted my immune system to be protected since it is low and hospitals have lots of sick patients that can get me sick and my body can’t fight back if I get sick all end up admitting if I get sick ( the reason I didn’t want to wait outside was because their was no chairs and I had just taken my chemo pills and my body felt weak) she then told me “ your standing up right now in a rude way like if I was lying that’s when I just decided to leave. I ended up going to Natividad where they had a full house but right away they put me in a separate room to wait until I was seen. I don’t like Natividad but at least they put me in a room to protect my immune system  until I was seen by a doctor. Never ever going to memorial again worse hospital ever. I rather drive to CHOMP.<//text>

When I asked the nurse what the pill I was about to take she replied I told you what it was when I walked in yet she mumbled it was almost as if I was talking to my 15yr old nephew who gets irritated for everything so I told her seems like I chose a bad night to get sick anyway I’m glad I’ll be getting a survey call in the next few days.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

My dad went into the ER with an appendicitis and the help he recieved was 5 star worthy. He had to get his appendix removed, the staff were keeping his pain under control and got him into surgery quickly. Post-OP care was great! Thank you doctors, surgeons, nurses, CNAs and hospital staff  for the great care my dad recieved. I am eternally grateful.<//Text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Review>3rd Floor Night Shift is Terrible. Some nurses there are so cold without compassion. Also, I noticed during my stay that nurses prioritize 'non-people-of-color'. I can name some few nurses like Jenette, Earl, & Mary. But AM shift is kinda ok. But I still need to give this a 1 star.<//Review>< Pics>

This hospital could use an improvement. A nurse name Marie from One Main came to the room. She looked at me from foot to head.  Never say "hi". She handed me the discharge papers and said that she had to read it to me. I noticed how thick the discharge papers, so I made a big "sigh" and rolled over my eyes. Nurse Marie Lashed out Pointing her Finger on me, and said, "I'm not gonna put up with that or I will call security". So, I went to call the house supervisor, but never came. Meanwhile, she was yelling, "Come back here and sign this paper". This is another racism. I hope they have camera or microphone in the hospital to capture this incedent.</text>

<review>Took my sister to the hospital for stomach flu like symptoms and spent 7.5 hours here. She was seen by a medical professional a combined time of 38 minutes. One nurse was nice when she was here but medical assistants taking vitals were fulfilling a routine and that is it. No patient interaction. No smile. No hello. They dumped us in a larger room and forgot about the Tylenol she is was suppose to have. Doctor was suppose to check on her once more before discharge and we still haven't...I finally spoke up and got attitude back. We are still waiting for the Tylenol... thank you to the kind nurse but we are never coming back. CHOMP is worth the drive.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Oh yeah. I remember that Marie from 1main. She is racist. A staff  told me she was double faces. I was a patient once and she made me very uncomfortable the way she looks at me. She never even greeted me. Then, when another staff came in, she was like so bipolar and became nice. That nurse Marie is either a pretentious or a bipolar racist. I heard a lot of Racist in this hospital. I wish the management would do something about it since this hospital is founded by a man who is very dear to the minority farmer like us. Thank you.</Review>

Had a wonderful experience! I went to get information on the location for an orientation and the staff was so friendly and helpful! A volunteer by the name of Lisette was especially helpful, she kindly showed me the exact location of the conference room and showed me around! Million thanks to her and the staff!< /review>

<gmapID>0x808df88a307e95e1:0x59abeb7122d76528< /gmapID><Text>Where to begin.. I went to ER due to  dull pain in my abdomen.  They kept me there forever.. I was in a bathroom vomiting.  I was hospitalized, and they went through many examinations.  Employees were laughing and joking among themselves while I was in pain.  They did not find what was wrong with me for 2 and half days.   They took my blood every half an hour... and not one of them could take my blood right.  Both my arms turned purple, and one of them tried to take my blood from finger's joint.  I screamed from pain.  Even my husband became quite upset.  The only nice person there was the cleaning lady who gave me a ice water in the middle of night.  I had a fever of 106-107F.  Finally, they found that my Appendix had ruptured, I was taken to surgery immediately.  The surgeon was a very kind gentleman though.  I will never ever go back to this hospital under any circumstance.<//Text></record>

<Review>Pros:
* Some very professional, caring staff, doctors and hospitalist's. (And you know who you are.)
* The 4th floor beds were much more comfortable than previous visits.
* I met many people there that I would hang with. And I don't hang with many folks.
* The whole food experience was a joy with a vast menu modeled after "Room Service" at a hotel.
I looked forward to picking up the phone and ordering what I wanted. It was good food and delivered quickly.

Cons:

* ER beds sucked.
* Right hand sometimes doesn't know what the left hand is doing.
* Had to at times make many requests to get results.
* Rarely any patient feedback from staff unless you request it.</Review><Gmap_id>0x808df88a307e95e1:0x59abeb7122d76528<//Gmap_id><userid>104362902523766405312< /userid>< pics>

This review only applies to this particular E.R. visit for my daughter(she's ok just a double ruptured eardrum) and she was in pain. For once in my entire life, ..I never thought I'd live to experience this amazing miracle. My daughter was in and out in 15 minutes! No lies! It was amazing! I barely had time to park! Thanks for quality care at the speed of E.R. light....thanks to the health pros who are actually doing the right things, all the time. Things seem to go alot smoother when there is top of the line, quality pros. This was my most favorite memetable E.R. moment out of my 48 yrs( my age) lived in Salinas my entire life, born and raised, raised 3children here, what a great experience. I think everyone gets only one of these E.R.miracles in a lifetime...maybe or maybe the physicians and staff at SVMH have it together. Maybe??? Luv ya all!</review>

If I could, I'd give it 0 stars honestly. The staff lag. They're constantly saying different things. They are not there when you need them. I had to wait over an hour just for my IV TO be taken out so that I could go home after being there for 2 nights.
My grandpa also had a stroke waiting in the waiting room , after staff were told he was having the symptoms of it. He is now paralyzed on his entire left side because the staff of memorial ignored him.
I've never had such bad experience with a hospital. Honestly, go the extra distance to go somewhere else.<//Text>

Another twisted odyssey through the SVMH system.   Yes thirteen weeks it took and no results.  It all started at my MD's office when I complained of knee pain.  Ortho referral was determined.  Six weeks later I get a call from ortho office to make appointment.  Two weeks later I see ortho MD.  He says MRI.  Two more weeks to get MRI appointment.  Now I thought that when MD gets MRI results I would get a call for appointment.  Not happening.  So it has been three weeks and I call to get appointment.  Wait two more weeks.  MD says you need a knee brace.  One week later Ortho people call me, I make appointment.  Now I have been on this journey for twelve weeks.  Let's get the brace.  What a cluster, no brace for me.  I have insurance and money but this does not work for the brace people.  From here the story degenerates to the level of stupid.  Anyway my knee still hurts and I have gotten no treatment, just talk.  The interesting part is that everyone got paid.  And I still have a bad knee.  FYI the radiology guys sent me a bill three days after the MRI which I paid.  Subsequently my insurance paid the bill also.  When I pointed that out to billing and asked for a refund they said basically, "tough".  They are in Dallas Tx. Not much I can do there.
Bottom line is to find a different outfit than SVMC. For them its not about medical care and treatment it's about extracting money from you and prolonging the process until you just give up.< /review>

Well, our experience with this hospital is like in the horror movie. I took my love ones in ER... I asked for assitance regarding my love ones but this nurse named Jennifer just ignored me. Instead, the security guard at that time came to help my love ones. While we were inside, The same nurse Jennifer (a nurse that has a tattoo of a flower on her rigth arm) kept ignoring my love ones, so we just patiently waited until she called us but the way she handled my love ones was so insensitive. She kept on typing on the computer without looking at my love ones. So, we finished our turn and waited for another 45 minutes. While waiting, I noticed the way Jennifer handled another patient. This time a small kid like around 1yr old. I saw how jennifer pulled the kid's arm so abruptly while putting an hospital wrist band. "It was like pulling a piece of chicken wing". The kid cried so hard and loud. It was horrible. I stood there feeling sorry for the kid. I hope the camera in the hospital captured it.
I hope if anyone who cares can do something about it... this is inhumane!
I hope that the hospital should put a compassionate nurse in the ER and Not insensitive and cold nurse.
We prefer to maintain anonymous for fear of retaliation since Jennifer might belong to a gang or something.< /Review>

<Text>as a patient at this hospital i was treated extremely well by every single nurse, doctor, aide, everyone. as a visitor, i had a terrible experience the day a relative gave birth to her baby.  i went to the hospital to meet the new baby.  Soon after i arrived, a nurse named Amanda entered the room to  collect blood from the baby. Before she entered the room, I had taken my phone out hoping to take a few pictures or short video of the new baby. I was aboht to take the first picture of the baby  when the nurse stepped into the shot . She looked right at me and thought i was taking video of her as she began to collect blood from the baby.  With the atitude of a u kno what and a matching look on her face, she told me in a demanding and foul way not to take pictures or video, even though i was not.  she was so disgustingly rude i cried out of anger later. i wasnt going to get into it at the hospital room, afterall it was a joyous occassion. i dont kno if she still works there but if she does, she shouldnt be working with the public. she shouldnt be ruining joyous occassions by treating people in such a belittling and humiliating manner. I ended up without a single picture and no video.  Honestly, i'm sure this hospital has strict guidelines for its staff to follow because it is a quality hospital. Therefore,   i have no doubt in my mind Amanda is a skilled  nurse  who hopefully provides great care to  patients in her care.  Her attitude and how she treats people is the problem.  Thats only one nurse though. There are many more skilled nurses capable of treating respectful people like human beings.  Despite the degrading way i was treated by this nurse that night, I think Salinas Memorial is a fantastic hospital with excellent staff providing the county with quality medical care.< /Text>< pics>

I was a patient on a Friday night post dog bite to my left hand.  The ER ED staff met that great combination of right on clinical expertise and professional empathetic bedside manner.  The physician assistant was like me a professional medical provider, I'm a RN CS FNP and cover a local clinic. BTW we make the worst patients lol. He was thorough and spot on in his care. So keep up the good work.
Major Mike
PS update, as a retired US Army Major I earned my Tri-Care for Life. Plus MediCare. I was a bit confused/confounded about why I still was being billed from the Salinas Valley Emergency Medical Group for the physician assistant who I have nothing but high praises as noted before. MediCare didn't pay any for services rendered by the PA-C. Tricare also did not pay either.  With this being said, the financial counselor at the hospital was very helpful and directed me on what to do with my $480 bill. FYI the hospital ER/ED bill was paid in full from medicare/Tricare just not the medical provider. So thanks for the assistance.  Your ER/ED still deserve an "atta-boy" and a five star rating.
PS PS I would be remiss if I didn't mention Brandon and Elizabeth with the collection agency with Salinas Valley Emergency Medical Group based out of Monterey.  This was my first time experience with a collection agency.  They are looking into this mystery on why MediCare and Tri-Care didn't pay my bill. They were both professional and caring. Heck they even listened to my war stories delivering combat medical care in Afghanistan and Iraq. Thanks again for your ears.
FYI I have my congressman Devin Nunez looking into this also. I pay MediCare $400 several times a year for coverage and not to mention tricare for life after service to my Country for 23years.</Review>

<Review>Was there for a LOD due to military training. I faxed over a form that needed to be signed by the physician/ doctor who saw me in the ER and never got the form back. Left many voicemail to get the form signed, so the hospital could get paid, but still no call back.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Rate>1<//Rate><user>106430671603961947880<//user></record></dataset><record>

The hospital staff was great.  Everyone there was helpful, friendly and a pleasure to work with.  The food was excellent, the facility was just fine. But...the doctor that was assigned to me at the emergency ward was horrible.  As a person with atrial fibrillation, I had a severe tachycardia that caused heart failure and unconsciousness.  Dr Wlodarzyk immediately talked me into a subdermal implant to record future heart rhythm at a time that I could not yet think straight following the heart failure.  He scheduled a nuclear stress test the next day along with that procedure, which somehow failed to occur (the stress test).  That next day, after the implant procedure, after I was thinking more clearly, I requested to leave the hospital and contact my cardiologist as I did not want to have another nuclear stress test - I had two in the last five years and did not want to expose my body to more radiation danger.  He told me that I had a cardiac infarction, and if I did not take the test he would notify the DMV to pull my driver's license.  I asked why the procedure didn't occur as scheduled and he told me it was because I did not fast...which was untrue, as I did fast and did have the implant procedure - which he did! (I now am contemplating taking out this unnecessary device myself). As I expected, the nuclear test showed no infarction.  He wouldn't release me until the late end of the second day even though I was cleared to leave 8 hours earlier, and then he notified the DMV to pull my license anyway!  He was arrogant and overbearing.  I won't ever go to the Salinas hospital again just to make sure I don't come across this jerk.</text>

My dad was in/out of svmh hospital for couple of years. I would say some staff members are professional courteous, but I can honestly say that the 4th & 5th floors are straight Racist. The 3rd floor, I only encountered 2 staff members named Lourdes (cna) & Ria (charged nurse) who are cold or somewhat unprofessional. that's my professional observation during our stay in svmh.</review>

He asked me about my drug use and proudly i answered honestly i have 30days clean. Thats when he rolled his eyes my husband was the one pointing it out to me. Ive always been honest with them no matter how bad it looks! Didnt give me my allergy band until i refused to give blood. Refused to check me for the flu (why i came in to begin with). So i choose to leave. I choose to never go  back and to try and change anyone elses mind about going to the horrible place!!!

<text>You know I've always known SVMH to be a great hospital but lately all I've been hearing is bad reviews just by word of Mouth. In one case my friend  went in for symptoms  of her face sagging from left side of her face, headache from top of her neck to bottom of her neck and fever. the doctors here sent her home with a fever and no pain medication and said all it was, was a migraine!! Really!!  She went to another doctor, he told her she was suffered a stroke.  Another case, my nephew has a heart condition. he went  with pain and other symptoms. They sent him away saying he had a pulled muscle. Turns out when they took him to Mee Memorial in King City, they actually did blood test and showed he had pneumonia. Now he is being sent to Stanford. Im not sure what's going on with the E.R. doctors, but please pay closer attention to your patients. They are not just a number, they are live human beings.</text>< Pics>

Oh boy, where do I begin...

I went in back in 2015 for what might have been diabetic complications. They took forever to get me in, asked if I was testing my blood sugar (sadly, nope, thanks to insurance issues at the time), and once I was checked in they just placed me in a hallway.

They put me into one of the ER rooms and without doing any sort of real diagnostics put me on an IV to rehydrate me as my problem was that I was dehydrated supposedly. Didn't check my blood sugar, didn't even do an A1c. Two very basic things you do to a diabetic complaining of what might be diabetic-related complications.

Anyway while I was laying there under the IV drip half-naked because they made me put on one of those gowns, they determined that someone needed that room more than I did and kicked me out to some remote hallway that was absolutely frigid. (This was in the middle of winter, mind. Also being on an IV bag sinks your body temperature.)

I had to sit there for 2-3 hours on an empty IV bag as medical staff just ignored me entirely. After which they just let me go. No further diagnostics, clean bill of health.

Imagine my surprise when about a month later I end up in the hospital again, this time SERIOUSLY ill with ketoacidosis, something that SVMH may have caught if they bothered to even try.

Though more recently whenever my girlfriend comes in for a minor respiratory infection they will continually write it off and tell her she's fine but she isn't and it quickly turns into full-blown bronchitis, at which point they're like "OH! NOW something's wrong!" and my girlfriend is hacking up her lungs for the better part of a month when it could have been prevented easily.<//Review>

First I'd like to say I'd rather give it a 1, but if I were sent to are alternate Hospital in Salinas I would have to give this a star up... and that is because when you're brought into the ER because this is what it is emergency care. I believe they would know how to deal with a heart attack at least I pray? Now the real reason I have been in this Hospital one time I have never seen patients left in hallways to wait for a room, while I'm watching the staff talk about their personal lives, or joke around amongst each other.. This is a professional place ," I know because I worked in this field before my injury. Now number 2 , for all of you that have gone in with pain on the scale of 1 to 10 end are 8 plus or Worst 10 ...you should be treated immediately as well as any other persona would be treated for what their issues are.... For all of you professional or NOT... let me give you a little education *a bill was passed called (the Pain Act) I f you Do Not know it , Learn IT!
NOW... The big insult is to be accused, looked at, or referred to as "a addicted person, a pass addictive person, or a drug seeker! I myself whom have one too many times , never dabbled into street drugs... except in my teenage years which I have tried LSD , and had been laced with dust..(A SCARY N SCARRING EPISODE!!!) Other than this, I am Pro Cannabis That is LEGAL w/Dr. Approval!!! I don't even Drink . And what is so sad they give this assumption do to how you look...( if you've ever been in pain this high and had to call an ambulance I don't think you're going to be putting on a evening gown while you wait ) SADLY Some ignorant staff that do not know how to tell vital signs, because if they did pay attention they would know you are in pain or something is wrong ! (They are called vital signs for a reason!)  I used to be vital personnel staff before I could no longer work my field , Due to my injuries. NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO SUFFER ...IT IS INHUMAN!!! Or worse could be a indication of a illness the is SERIOUS or Lead to Future Long term Illnesses! ( I AM ONE OF THIES VICTIMS) PLEASE keep in mind that these issues that I have gone through is not only why I'm giving this post, because I have seen too many other people that I have brought in treated the same or ever seen others sitting in a chair at the hospital suffering, SADLY! My only other issues with the Alternative Hospital...Is there should NEVER be a Job for A Person whom is prejudice in any which way or form .
No I did not write this post simply due to my education, or my experiences but I know there are many many of you that have experienced the same as I.. Put your post up.. this is your rights Plus you should be treated humanely , confused?.. look at the walls in the E.R. "there is a HIPAA law posted.. Call ask questions!!!! For Now I seek Help out of County !</Text>

The worse experience EVER!!
I went to the ER with horrible pain and the staff were very rude. Didn't care to served me. I had to wait 2 hours before I was given a room and 3 hour to get pain medicine. The doctor was not the best. Very incensible people at this hospital...< /Review>

<review>Didn't like anything about my experience here. Went the er and was treated like I didn't know what I was talking about or what I had even though I've been to doctor 6 times over the last three months for this. The nursing staff was rude. Nurse Claudia in particular. Then treatment was generic and pushed me right out the door so they can keep looking at Facebook while working in their nurses station. Absolutely horrible.</review></record></dataset><record>

<review>My experience was terrible, I find it very inaccurate when it comes to allergic reactions. I strongly suggest to physicians to really take their time when it comes to diagnosing their patients. Last night I was at the ER, I entered with a outofcontrol itching, my body was on fire with hives. All they did was to look at me, ask a bunch of questions and end up with the guessing game. The response from two diffrent people (because I recuested a second opinion) the best they came up with was, "We don't know  what you have." Wow, very disappointing and on top of that they had the courage to prescribe me something?
This is unethical, I just can belive it. I feel like I  wasted my time bacuse their prescription didn't  make a change. Hopefully the over the counter medication that I did a reasearch helps because I do care. Overall their way they welcomimg their guests was great. I encourage Doctors to take their time when dignosing a person. By making the apropiate health exams before making an educated guess. The results of their diagnosis needs to be more in depth in order for their patients to feel more secure when taking medication.Thank you.</review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

< Review>
Seen at the er for swollen feet and cold legs with weakness while walking. By the time I got their the swelling had reduced some and my feet had become incredibly sweaty. The dr did nothing but say they don't look swollen and asked if I took pictures. They order blood tests and my bill doesn't even show all the blood tests they supposedly ordered. It took 5 hours to get out of there even though basically nothing was done. I later had to go to a different hospital when recommended by a clinic to do so. The other hospital did 5 times the amount of checks and between them and the clinic I finally found out I have a herniated spin and spinous process bones impinging nerves causing the problem. My bill for svmh is more than my combined bill for everything else I have had done since and within 2 months of them issuing me the bill they immediately sent it off to a collection agency and start incurring interest as well. They were horrible in every way. Criminal billing practices falsely claiming they conducted certain lab tests and then never helped even slightly thanks for the 2k bill after insurance for telling me I should take pictures.

NEVER BE SEEN HERE FOR ANYTHING BY CHOICE.< /Review>

<Review>I delivered my baby there and had an amazing experience. Their labor and delivery department is excellent. Everyone starting with the check-in staff to nurses and doctors was friendly, caring, and professional. Many thanks to Danielle, Veronica, Oscar, Kim, Dr. Klick and Dr. Lee for taking such good care of us. The food was pretty good as well.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

I don’t remember the guys name but he helped me when my vape pen was leaking BAD. He took the time to look at it and give some great advice. He was super sweet and very knowledgeable on what he was doing. He even suggested a different coil that worked SO much better with my mod. Will definitely keep my business with them.< /text>

< Review>
Jackson Smoke Shop has recently Switched management including new workers!  They are all very knowledgeable about the products they sell, and how to use them! The workers are also very kind and helpful!

Additionally, all Smoke Shops in California do not, have not, and will not accept returns/refunds on any items because it is unsanitary. Once the item purchased leaves the shop, the customer is liable for any damage or defects in the purchased product.< /Review>

< Review>
Terrible prices. I paid 3x as much for what I was looking for as I would have paid elsewhere. It had been a long time since I had needed to buy vape coils and I accidentally bought the wrong ohmage. Came back 30 min later to exchange and was rudely told that they don't do that. So now I'm stuck with overpriced, useless coils. Avoid this place, there are better options nearby.<//Review>

<Review>I purchased a Vision Spinner vape pen, and it completely fell apart two weeks later. They wouldn't give me a refund or an exchange. Stupid me, I bought another pen, a slender, cigarette-style (no name), and what do you know, it stopped working after two weeks! So I wasted $30 within a month at this store. What kind of business doesn't stand by their products? Buyer beware!< /Review>< time>

These guys are great at what they do. Super quick turn around time and fast shipping. They always provide a sample picture or video of the product before production starts so you can verify everything is correct and you are satisfied. They are always running some type of special to help save you money without sacrificing their high quality prints.</Text>

jimmy and felicity over at vinyl bandits are super cool people. they always provide quick, quality products at a reasonable price. i once had a show that i needed 3 different designs in 1 weeks notice. they got right to work and i had the stickers in 3 days. they're also fun to follow on Instagram @vinyl.bandits . banners, decals, stickers for any occasion, any shape, vinyl bandits got you covered.<//review>

Happy with the results of my logo. I use these stickers for my small business and needed to make sure the quality of the print and stickers were perfect. They exceeded my expectations and also had quick turn around time. I highly recommend printing with vinyl bandits.< /Review>

As a designer, the biggest fear I have is that a company I ask to print out my work miss the mark with the colors that I have painstakingly chosen for my piece Vinyl bandits hit the marks perfectly and accurately represented the colors in my character helping me see it in a beautifully designed sticker for my brand. This gives me complete faith in vinyl bandits for all future work. Awesome!</review>< Pics>

<rating>5< /rating><text>Absolutely love Vinyl Bandits. Saw them on Instagram and decided to try them out and now they are my go-to for turning my digital art into stickers. They get back to you really fast and produce quality stickers. What's nice about using a small local printer is that you actually form a dialogue instead of just uploading a design, click checkout, and hope for the best.</text><gmapID>0x80dd28aafd662413:0x3aae6c6bc22dc417< /gmapID>< Pictures>

A designer friend of mine recommended Vinyl Bandits for great quality waterproof stickers. Seeing how hers came out it was a no brainer! I requested a quote from their website and followed up with them on Instagram because I was very excited to get this project going. They were quick to respond and made this process a breeze. I decided to go with their Holographic sticker and I was NOT DISAPPOINTED !!! They sent me a video of how it looked reflecting and I approved the order. They quickly produced and shipped my stickers and couldn’t be more pleased with this service. The stickers looked EVEN BETTER in person!!! I’m in love and will definitely be getting more stickers done!<//Text>

Vinyl Bandits did an awesome job with my stickers. They responded to my messages quickly and provided a sample next day. I got my order within 4 days and they also gave me some of their stickers with some extra ones. I will totally recommend them to all my friends.</review>

<text>Absolute above and beyond service! They where extremely helpful with the whole process. Not to mention the patients they had with my last minute design changes! They confirmed the approval of the sticker via video, which was impressive and unexpected. Once approved, they shipped in no time, completely top notch service. When receiving the stickers, and seeing them in hand, I was blown away by the quality of these bad boys! The icing on the cake, was the amount of super cool freebies they threw in! I will not be having my stickers made by anyone else in the near future! Thanks for everything guys!</text>< rate>

What a painless process and a fantastic product! I uploaded my image, and submitted for a quote. Received a quick response back. They printed off my sticker and sent me a picture of it before going through with the order to make sure I was satisfied with my stickers. Will be going with Vinyl Bandits again!! Thank you!</Review>

I sell treat gift boxes through Etsy and I needed a way to put my logo on the boxes. I sent my logo to Vinyl Bandits on IG and got a cut sample photo within 2hours. It let me know they were serious about helping me get my logo made into die cut stickers. So I ordered and received the stickers all within 1 week. Everything looked just like pictured in our messages. It was an amazingly fast experience and I can’t wait to order again. I totally recommend these guys!!!< /Text>

Vinyl Bandits was very professional and helpful in assisting me with getting my sticker created. In addition to offering great pricing, they will answer all questions you may have about their product. They helped me out figuring out the sizing for my sticker & whether I should get laminated or non-laminated stickers. The fair prices also include extremely fast turn around within a few business days of inquiring about getting my sticker printed I had my stickers delivered to me. 10/10 will recommend<//Review>

I did my research and they still managed to beat the competitors. I’m very impressed with this staff because they not have have gotten frustrated with the many questions I have every time I place an order. Very impressed with how professional the work. Their quality work is top quality and never fail to impress me when I’m doubting my own art work. Their turn around is so fast they completed one of my orders right on time before my event even after I submitted a last minute order. They even provide you with a test sticker within 24 hours or sometimes with in minutes out of experience. Communication is always key to keeping a customer and they have earned a customer for life. Thank you

<Pictures>None</Pictures><Text>I always hit up Vinyl Bandits for our sticker printing needs. Their prices are great, customer service is top notch and their turn around times are unbeatable. I asked for rush printing on one of our orders, because we needed stickers for a last minute event. I contacted them on a Thursday and the stickers were sitting in our mailbox Friday. I was amazed and thoroughly impressed. I understand this can't be done everytime, but ever since then I decided I won't go anywhere else for sticker printing.< /Text><user_name>Michael Notarianni<//user_name>< gmap_id>

I’ve been using this business for around 5  years now and I’ve never been disappointed. Always great prices, good quality (Stickers have lasted years so far) , easy to work, fast printing/ shipping and responds quickly to questions . I definitely recommend them to anyone looking for good quality products.< /review>

I wasn't surprised to see five solid stars or the consistent positive reviews for Vinyl Bandits. All of which are greatly deserved. I've gone through various custom sticker/slap print shops, bad, good and even great print shops. But these Bandits are just beyond all the others I've dealt with, in ALL aspects; customer service, printing, materials used, quality control, their special deals... just name it. Or even better, see for yourself why they have five solid stars and you'll understand, not only my appreciation for these Bandits, but the consistency of great reviews from customers.</text>

< Review>
Vinyl Bandits is the company that I always refer to my friends who need any sticker work done. I have been using them for roughly 2 years now and I am always grateful for their affordable deals and super fast shipping. My stickers have been received well by my customers and to top it off, they’re water proof as well. I’ve even seen my stickers on a thermos that was dish washed multiples times and still came out looking just as fresh! Definitely try them out and enjoy the easy process worry-free...you’ll be satisfied.< /Review>

<text>Started the sticker process with Vinyl Bandits well over a month ago. The process was long due to my inability to make a decision on which designs I wanted to go with. They were patient with with me and assisted me all the way to the very end. The quality on these were amazing and the turn around time is extremely quick...I will be ordering more soon.</text>< resp>

<Review>Amazing!! I've ordered multiple times from Vinyl Bandits and I'm always blown away by the affordable prices and incredible quality! I recieve my stickers less than a week after I pay the invoice and they always communicate well and answer all my questions.

Great prices on stickers for my business. Way cheaper than the “other guys” and they didn’t skimp on quality. I’d come back for more!< /review>

<pics>None</pics><Text>These guys KILLED IT. I messaged them on on Instagram on a Saturday night with my vectored image. I ordered 300 individually cut 4x4 in' stickers. They had it out their door by Tuesday. You cant get a better deal on the money end and the fast great communicative service like these dudes did. Don't go to those goofy websites that say they offer deals and all that bs. You will not get the quality of what you want from them and their deals cant even come close to the deals and quality vinyl bandits do.

THIS IS THE PLACE FOR YOUR STICKER NEEDS PERIOD.< /Text>< time>

First I used the printing services using an Instagram offer then was so happy with the end result, now this company is my go-to for stickers and much more to come.
You can tell the bandits pride themselves on impeccable customer service. Responsive and great quality work is why im a customer and will keep coming back.</Review>

Have been ordering stickers with them for 2 years and they never have failed me! They have worked with my sticker needs and always have given a quick turnaround on answering my questions. Great prices! They send proofs of your artwork for you to approve and shipping is quick! Don't be afraid to ask them any questions, they will work with you.</Text>

Just got my stickers in today and I have to say I'm very impressed! Best pricing around and it only took 3 days from order time to delivery date. From California to Louisiana, that's not bad turn around inimy book. The stickers are great quality and I would highly recommend to any thinking of making a purchase. Customers service is also great, they are very helpful and go above and beyond to make sure you get what you need. It was a little confusing placing my order but they were there every step of the way to put me at ease! Great company, great service and great product!!!< /review>

Absolutely amazing service!! Their web site is extremely easy to navigate & upload designs, they answered all my questions via I.G. very quickly, they made sure I was happy with the end design before they shipped. It was a fast process from start to finish & they were fast about not only designing our decal but it also arrived quickly. Great company & absolutely amazing product. Looking forward to ordering alot more!!!<//text>

<Text>Hi,  you don’t need to look any longer for a personable and professional printing company for your business (labels, stickers, promo). I have done the work for you - it’s Vinyl Bandits! I have wasted so much money as a new business owner with bad, delayed, mean, and poor quality from a list on businesses I selected from IG or recommended to me.
I have been pleased from the visit encounter and delivery with Vinyl Bandits. The staff is cool, patient, and professional.

<Text>I contacted Vinyl Bandits about printing a sticker for my company Orphintage. They were very quick to respond with a quote with a very fair price. They sent a picture proof of my sticker, and once I OK’d the proof they got to work! I had my order in no time. We are so happy with the quality of the final product! I’m ordering again as soon as we give all these stickers away.< /Text>< rate>

This company doesn't know the meaning of customer service and is trying to do something it is totally not capable for yet.

I had an issue with my refrigerator and freezer and their ad came up first on Google. I called to setup and appointment which was a painful process. They required all my contact information first before they could tell me if they had a service tech available for my area.

Once I gave them my contact information they tried to upsell me on a membership program to save money on my appointment and future appointments. I declined and said if I was interested after the service call I would work with the repair tech.

They finally checked availability and told me they couldn't get out today but would send someone out the following day from 9-10 am.

They sent me an email and a text message confirming with a link to manage my appointment. Clicking the link takes you to an error page saying to call them. No big deal I wait patiently for my confirmation the repair technician is on the way and by 10 am I finally decide to call.

The representative on the phone had a hard time speaking English and you could tell they were reading from a script. No matter what question I asked the response was "I forwarded your information to dispatch, expect a call soon".

I waited 30 minutes for my call soon and decided it was time to call back again, hopefully getting someone that could assist me this time.

When I call back I get the same representative with a lot of background noise from other representatives talking. He asks me to hold and while I am on hold I get a call from another representative in the same room that left me a message. In her message I can hear my representative say "he called to complain again what do I do?", the representative on the voicemail is telling me she needs to reschedule my appointment and she will send a text message to confirm but for me to call back in.

After waiting 5 minutes on hold a new representative is on the phone claiming to be from dispatch. He confirms my appointment is late but before he can check availability he wants to know if I'll accept their "maximum discount of $20" for my inconvenience.

I thank him for his time and tell him I'm no longer interested in continuing as I'm going to have to find a way to save my food from spoiling now at least another day.

I threw out over $600 in food today but I'm sure thankful for that $20 offer and wasting my time.

Do not use this company, they are not ready to do what they are trying to do.</text>

This company is the absolute worst experience I have ever had with a "repair."

1. First technician never showed up.
2. Second technician shows up, glanced at the machine and TOLD me verbally that it would be cheaper to replace than to repair.
3. Second technician writes up a two line assessment. The Information he he provided was incorrect. He said "stacked washer" which we do not have. Secondly, he claims he quoted me a price for repairs and he absolutely did not do that.
4. Company in order to "make this right" was supposed to send a NEW tech at 10 am. on Saturday. HE  NEVER SHOWED.

TWICE the "COMPANY" AND I USE THAT  WORD LOOSELY, because this was an absolute fiasco and a scam.

5. I was told by one of the phone operators that my money would be refunded. Yet, I get an email saying it would not be.

6. I called AGAIN to explain AGAIN what transpired and demand I be refunded my money.

TWO NO SHOWS AND A LIAR is what the company provided and yet refused a refund.

Just for the no shows, I should be reimbursed for my time. I WAITED at the assigned time SET BY THEM for both no show appointments!!! I had to leave my office to get home to deal with the techs at the ASSIGNED TIMES, TWICE! So, not only did they not provide a competent technician they cost me money having to miss work!!  At this point the money paid for the assessment and missed work time, I could have purchased a new washer!!

The technician got paid....I paid him....BUT I AM THE ONE THAT LOST NOT ONLY THE PAYMENT BUT THE MONEY I WOULD BE PAID AT MY JOB. How is this not a refundable situation?

I demanded a refund yet again. Instead, I was was then offered a $15 credit towards the repairs. I let them know I would never allow someone from their company to touch any appliance I have.

THEN SHE HUNG UP ON ME!!

What the  company did here was completely unprofessional.

I am a very dissatisfied customer with hard evidence proving they scammed me.< /Review>

<Text>This company is trying to over promise their availabilities.  And when they can't deliver, they will just ignore your request.  I tried to schedule to repair my iphone 3 times.  First time, they could not make it.  And they called me to try to reschedule.  I reschedule two more times, and there's no follow up when they can't come to the appointment.  I understand this is a gig economy which the company is relying on free lancer's availability.  But the least you can do is to follow up with the customers in the event you can't  make your appointment.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x8085808ac4cc06e3:0x80400c01195d87c6</gmap_id></record>

Avoid this company. They have missed their scheduled appointment three days in a row. You may think it's easy to book and you are saving money but in reality they will cost you more in your own time and money because their company is run so poorly and they can't organize their contractors to show up.</review>

TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE. DO NOT USE. I scheduled an appointment yesterday for today, btwn 3-4pm. I called customer service at 3:56pm to advise that she had not arrived - the customer service person told me that someone from dispatch would call me back. I called again at 4:45pm (as no one called) and waited on hold (listening to music) until 5:10pm (25 min!).....NO ONE EVER CAME ON so I hung up.

My guess is that they don’t hire professionals...I should’ve checked the reviews first - I see many people share my experience.< /Review>

I scheduled my appointment from 1-2pm.
4 pm they call me saying that unfortunately my place was too far away and they were canceling the appointment...
Come on... you have the zip code before accepting my appointment. “Too far away” shouldn’t be an excuse for canceling a costumer.</text>

I was skeptical to try the service since I usually like to meet up front with whom is doing something like this for me not online first. But choosing to give it a chance and seeing some good reviews I did it and had the absolute worst experience. No communication from the technician before, during wait time, or even after they never bothered to show their face. I would not recommend their services at all.</text>

Absolutely TERRIBLE experience. I gave them a chance over Sears Repair because apparently they had good reviews. (Pay attention to the probably FALSE reviews seeing how they have so many 5 stars and 1 star reviews) First, I went to the website to get an appointment for a Saturday. There were at least 8 slots open. After selecting a slot, I received a call a few hours later saying nothing was available until the following Monday (4-5pm). So I take a day off work to accommodate the new appointment Puls gave to me. Before Monday comes, i get an email and call asking to extend to 5-6pm for the same Monday.

Flash forward to Monday, it's 6:30pm and no tech arrives or calls. After multiple attempts to call Puls for an update, I finally get in touch with someone to check on the status of my technician's whereabouts. The rep puts me on hold to call the tech, and they could not get in touch with them. The rep  offers to reschedule me for later the same night with another tech.

I then get another call from Puls telling me that no one is available for tonight and that we can reschedule for a future date. At this point, I'm completely done. I can't continue to call days off from work, and no the measly $10 off coupon does not suffice any level of the constant inconvenience this company has provided. The website dates are unreliable, and apparently so are the technicians that they are outsourcing. I ended up just going with Sears Repair instead because they actually act professional. This experience was beyond ridiculous.< /Text>

Unreliable employees and terrible customer service. Had an appointment a few days ago, they gave me an estimated time window. The guy didn't show up - called customer service an hour after he was supposed to be there and they said they weren't even able to reach the guy. So I cancelled. Tried again today, and have been on hold with customer service for 15 minutes. Don't use this service - go elsewhere.</Text>

Pathetic customer service. Should have read reviews before booking this. All 1 star reviews in the past year.

Save yourself time by looking elsewhere. Your future is full of frustration when dealing with this company.

They will call you 30 min before appointment time and say no available technician.

<Review>Never let them near your phone, the screen they replace cost $20 and when you find out they will refuse to return your original screen so-called 'recycling’ and keep replace with that $20 screen.
In my case, I replace my iPhone screen and replace twice each time they replace the same quilty screen. Since I can't get my original screen I can't even go to apple store to replace it.
NEVER LET THEM NEAR YOUR PHONE!!!!
GO to the apple store for screen replace, IT IS NOT SO MUCH DIFFERENT COST.</Review><pics>None<//pics><rate>1< /rate><time>1527560278070</time>< user>

Cell savers are great, the name says it all. I had a technician dispatched a few hours after I requested and the total repair time took about 15-20 minutes. i highly recommend them !</Text>

Waited 2 days for a technician who didn't turn up. No contact from anyone with any explanation. When I called back at the end of day 1, they gave an excuse and rescheduled for the next morning- but nobody turned up again<//Review>

DON'T USE THIS SERVICE. They replace your screen with an after market screen (without letting you know). The screen has a weird glare, makes the screen way too bright and if you are sensitive to light will make you nauseous. They are all to happy to take your money and not help you fix the problem.</Review>

Puls technician was called to install out of the box new Sony TV with Bose soundbar and Samsung TV with JBL sound bar and conceal wires.

Technician gave up after the Sony TV X800G and Bose Soundbar Solo 5 would not connect via Bluetooth. No brackets for Solo5 wall mount.

Also the JBL Soundbar 5.1 and Samsung Q80R TV do not want to pair via Bluetooth after the initial day.

Paid in full for the service as technician promised to come back once I had Solo5 wall mount brackets.

Called technician after 2 days and told him that I have the brackets now. Also told him that maybe we should have optical cable connectivity between soundbar and the TV instead of BT. Connected both theTVs myself with optical cables dangling from the sides.

Also cannot find the manuals after the technician came and unboxed everything.

Day 3 called the technician and said he will fix it soon
Day 6 called the 888 support number and got the scripted sorry and someone will get back
Day 9 called the 888 support number again and got the scripted sorry for your inconvenience msg from Frank  @ support ID# 569412

Paid for poor service. I hope the Mgt. and board members address poor customer experience at the Company ASAP<//review>

Never deal with @pulscom. Bad service, poor quality products, no respect for the customer. I got my phone screen replaced by Puls and I fully regret it. They use bad quality parts and offer no support after they get your money. Very disrespectful company.< /text>

This is place is terrible. The first time I scheduled an appointment, the technician was late so I called to see if they could contact him. They said they had texted him and he didn't respond. I cancelled the appointment and made a new one for a few days later and they never assigned a technician, even though they're open every day. I tried calling them to see if they were going to assign a technician and I sat on hold for 20 minutes. Don't ever use their services.<//Text>

<Rate>3<//Rate><Text>Utterly terrible service. I made an appointment to have a Pixel XL 2 repaired, which their website claims they can fix. They showed up 10 minutes early, and cancelled since I wasn't there at a *different* time. Then I rescheduled, waited around, and got a call from them saying they don't service a Pixel XL 2. Why make me wait, twice, when you can just say on your website that you don't service a Pixel XL 2?

EDIT: After seeing this bad review, they called me and scheduled a third visit (with a $40 discount). This time the guy showed up within the allotted time window and fixed my phone. This would be a 5 star review if they did that the 1'st time instead of the 3'rd.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>{'time': 1552081774615, 'text': 'Hi Chris,\n\nWe are sorry to hear about your experience with your appointment.

<Review>DO NOT USE PULS. First off this “on demand” service is NOT on demand. I requested a repair from 2-3pm. I understand if nobody is available but nobody reached out to me until 3:30pm even tho I kept calling to ask for an update. So when they finally got back to me they said they could come between 7-8 pm and I said that that was totally fine. I wasn’t just grateful that they were available that day. Nobody got here until 8:30pm with no time update. Didn’t bother me because I know stuff happens. The technician broke my phone. After the repair it wouldn’t turn on despite the efforts I made and the efforts that the Apple store made. So I ended up having to buy a new phone after paying $110 for the repair. I requested a refund and Puls agreed since they broke my phone. I’ve been waiting 3 weeks for a refund when I was told it would take 3-5 business days. I’ve emailed several times for an update and they keep saying that “they will check on this and get back to me”. This company has only wasted my time and money and I would NOT recommend to anybody. If you need a screen repair just go to the Apple store. It’s only like $20 more and your guaranteed a good outcome. This is absolutely ridiculous!
On a bright note- the technician was very friendly and professional. This review is not towards him. Mistakes happen but the way the company has handled this mistake is not acceptable.< /Review>< Pictures>

I will give it 4 stars for one reason only, because the timing was way off. Good thing I was at work. I was scheduled for 11AM and my guy who was amazing and had other appointments came by 3PM which it wasn't the biggest deal because I was at work, but this is why I give a 4 star. Hilial was amazing super quick, super friendly he changed my camera and the lense $79 each; which I thought it would be cheaper but it wasn't the lens of the outside was charged a camera. Nonetheless I have my camera working now and my guy was really good 😊<//Review>

<Text>NEVER USE THIS SERVICE. They don't hire quality employees, and have horrible customer service.

Used it to hang my TV, the tech was 30 minutes late, and made me uneasy during the appointment (got way too close to my face, followed me around my apartment, sat on my bed- I couldn't wait to get him out of my house).

At the end of the appointment, he tried to ask me out. I refused, closed the door, and went over to my newly-mounted TV- only to realize it was crooked. I immediately contacted customer support via phone. They referred me to an online form, saying it would be rectified immediately if I provided a picture. I filled out the form, provided a picture- they had the audacity to send me a $40 off coupon SHOULD I CHOOSE TO SCHEDULE ANOTHER INSTALLATION. No refund. No person out to fix it. $200 for installation. Total waste.

They ended up finally contacting me (after two emails and a google review). The rep apologized profusely, said they took customer safety very seriously and that they used background checks- but that there was no sexual harassment training for technicians. They decided to schedule me for an installation revision.

I was cycled through two technicians in their scheduling system, because the first one they assigned wasn't able to come within the 9-10AM window. I assumed the new tech assigned would be on time because he accepted the appointment- I had to ask for the time off work for the second time.

The new technician is an hour and a half late, and still hasn't shown up. My experience with this company has been awful. Hire someone via a more trusted service. Don't make the mistake I did.< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

<Review>Terrible customer service and scheduling system. Contradictory messaging through text email and calls from the call center regarding existing appointments. Appointments canceled 30 minutes before scheduled window first claiming no tech available then claiming no parts.
*Update*
Changed from 1 to 3. I received calls from both Faye and Priya to resolve the scheduling woes. Puls covered the cost of second repair. The repair portion of the service is stellar. Dealt with Roshan on two occasions to replace the back camera and glass for my Pixel 2.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

This company did the right thing when they made a mistake. They texted in the middle of my appointment window to tell me they didn’t service my area. I was pretty pissed and disappointed and I let them know on yelp. They were very apologetic and sincere when they got back to me. They paid for half of my tv mount and installation with a competitor which really blew me away. Not many companies now a days care about their reputation it’s just on to the next when a customer gets a bad experience. Thanks PULS for doing the right thing</Text>

Bravo!  A taco restaurant in a Japanese market in Little Tokyo.

I tried a chicken taco with molé sauce,. Excellent!  Shredded chicken, soft corn tortillas, with queso fresco drizzled on top.

I'll be back!</review>

I do wish everything was served just a bit hotter because of the room temp (which is a cold grocery store), all food is cold after the first taco.

Loved this place. I was SO hungry when I got here. Definitely get the avocado sauce with whatever you get. Carne was best, but getting to try the differing tacos with the $5-6(?) plate where you get 3 small tacos was super fun and perfect for exploring new tastes. Tried chapulines (grasshopper) and mole for the first time which was on my foodie bucket list. Mole was too spicy for ME, but not complaining. Chapulines were...earthy, glad to try, but not again. :)</Text>

< Review>
All I can say is Bad Son Tacos is legit! These are quite possibly the greatest carnitas I've ever had. They're not quite as salty as others you may have had, but that's a good thing. You can also tell that a lot of love goes into every tortilla. These are the sort of tacos that remind me of when mom wakes up super early to prepare everything from scratch, they're that good! Tip: get your parking validated in the grocery store and parking is free for 1.5 hours.</Review>

I had the Steak Salad. My salad was truly delicous. I enjoyed it a lot.  The staff was friendly and cordial. Free parking...</review>

<Text>Solid taco spot, meat was a little tougher than I liked but maybe I was unlucky. Flavors were on point though and the handmade corn tortillas were great. Similar to the standard tortillas at a typical taco trucks or a supermarket variety but a lot nicer. Liked the Jamaica agua fresca too, perfectly flavored and balanced.<//Text><user_name>Glarence Zhao</user_name><time>1558123554417<//time></record></dataset><record>

The best Mexican food in Arts District & Little Tokyo.

You can taste its homemade quality through and through. I've their had tacos, burritos, quesadillas, & elote; all fantastic. Can't wait to have more.

Hint: They serve awesome fish tacos on Fridays!< /Review>

<review>Multiple excellent options on the menu, but their mole chicken is the best in my opinion. The habañero salsa is uniquely good too. Has me coming back regularly<//review>< pictures>

<Review>This place is open! As of 02-07-20, they opened their doors and it looks really good. Today date is 02-11-20, and I entered to see that they remodeled with new fixtures. It seems like they got alot of new inventory.(remember, items are donated. Don't be upset if you cant find something. I'm grateful for the offerings.) Came around 6pm, and parking was full. Very impressed with the layout of this store.</Review>< Pics>

There was a woman and a younger man to assist us. The woman was okay but the male was incredibly condescending, rude, and disrespectful. If I wasn't trying to get rid of the stuff (that was in good condition) I would have said "screw it, put it back." and went to other side of town just to see if Oasis is open. I don't know if they expect brand new items, or just don't want to take from certain people. Nevertheless, I will never donate to Salvation Army again. I will find other places (like Oasis) to donate or just hand it out to people on the street, neighbors, etc.< /Text>

<Text>Mom passed away and we've been going through her estate. Took some antique books to salvation army donation. You drive around back and they make you wait.

Sure, you can find deals, but 2nd hand items priced far too high.  In my opinion, they have forgotten the thrift in thrift store. Skip it.  And it pains me to say that as Salvation Army does a lot of good, but seriously,  its not a department store!< /Review>

Went in trying to buy a queen bed frame.  The store manager insisted the one she handed us was a queen size, even though my husband told her it looked lile a king sized frame. After we got it home,  it was king-sized. Took it back and she exchanged it for a queen size frame.  Got it home and it did not have all of the pieces. Went back a THIRD time, and was given another frame. It, too, is missing pieces. You cannot get your money back, even when the employee sells you the incorrect product. It was not that much cheaper than a new one would have cost. Disappointing experience.< /Text>

One of the worse stores ever. Tell me why are they selling everything at such a high price...??? Everything they sell there is over price, like if it was being bought  new! Tell me why would they sale nasty stain pillows for 4.99 or 5.99 when they are used..! When I find new pillows for that price! Even at 99 cents store they have brand new pillows  2 for 3 dollars.. tell me why their lamps sofas and furniture are being sold at 100 or 200 dollars when I can get them new, for that price any where else..! The point of going to a second handed store it's to safe money! As it is they get the things for free!!!<//text>

I go here all the time and they had a black recliner here with no price tag the day I asked the manager there told me 20 bucks I come back the next day and ask about the same chair and they have no price on it still and tell me they have to text a mannager to get a price and I asked about the price the manager qouted me the previous day and they said they had to wait on a respond so I left a bit fraustrated then called at the end of the day and asked about the same chair and they said the manager never texted back and to try tomarrow then I call today and they tell me it's 35 for the chair to tell me one thing then another then make me waste my gas time going down there to get a run around on the price just isn't good business idk who manages this place but it seems very unfair what they did to me making me think it's one price then making me waste my gas going down there to be told something else<//review>

<text>Salvation Army has a sordid history and I cringe every time I walk into one. But this store is the worst. They overcharge on everything and I do not see how it serves the needy within the community. At these prices only e-Bay'ers can make a buck.< /text>< Pics>

<Text>I like some of the items there but a little disappointed in their policy for returns. Just found out you can't return their bric-a-brac or red tag items. They should post a sign saying this before you buy these items. Another problem is their sales, I've never been in a thrift store or any store that kick you out 30 minutes before the sale starts. Every place I've shopped at usually have the sale all day not at a certain time of the day. It's very frustrating to find items you want just to be told you have to leave so they can close to start the sale. Then once you return you pray someone else haven't taken the items you took your time to find. Also if you ask when is the next sale they claim they aren't sure so you have to drive by and hope you find a sale. I agree with some of the other comments about the prices they are to high for used items, this is a thrift store and the prices should reflect that. I've never seen a thrift store ran like this before. Won't be shopping there again would rather find a thrift store out of this valley that know how it should be ran.</Text>< resp>

Got there at 2:15 on a Saturday.  Just started looking when a rude checker started telling people to bring their items to the front as they were closing.  Apparently, they were going to have a sale at 3 and had to close before it.  Checker rudely started saying things like "we can't start the sale until everyone is out", "Nobody's moving", "I don't care ... if we have the sale".
Big sign on the wall says "Christianity in Action".  That ain't like my Jesus.
We left.</Review>

Sometime you can find great items here.  Some of the furniture is overpriced. Some of their items are more Expensive then buying it new.</Text>

Manager just comes out with prices out of the blue. Everything is over price, things that we can buy them for the same price. Items need repairs I don't know why they r so expensive.</Review>

(Translated by Google) Prices on clothes are better than Goodwill, but on things like ornaments or toys it is more expensive.

Salvation Army has a better clothes price than Goodwill but not on little stuff like miscellaneous.

<Review>I have been hurting for a hair cut since the pandemic and luckily discovered Westminster just recently. Hands down, this was easily the best experience I've had a hair salon in my life. Great cut, super quick, amazing attention to detail and better yet - really great advice and guidance on a new do for me.

Highly recommended.< /Review>< pics>

<text>For visit. Great experience. I called and was able to make a same day appointment and was a little concerned that I might get someone who didn't have many return clients or was just not that great.
I felt comfortable with their Covid practices and will be going back!
That was not the case! Very thorough and made a difference.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Mavis is by far the best beautician for hair extensions!  Her prices are great and when she puts in the extensions she makes sure the hair below the extensions will grow properly so your natural hair does not fall out or get damaged. I've been to many other salons for extensions and most people just want to get you in and out and don't care about preserving your hair. She also sells great hair too. It's a little
pricey but its great quality and will last a long time if taken care of properly!<//text>

Mavis is hardworking sweet and I love her attention to detail! She blends my hair so nicely that it always looks natural. I recommend Mavis her quality hair she sells is amazing too always so soft and doesn’t get tangled. I wouldn’t know what to do without her. I will continue to do my hair here in a loyal lifetime customer. 10 stars for Mavis!< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<review>First, they were pretty good to being on time. But the first stylist was honest and said there was a better stylist who should do the cut. I really appreciate the advice. Even if she wasn't getting paid for my service, my satisfaction was more important!
Its a good place for hair.</review></record></dataset><record>

The receptionist is always so friendly upon entering and all of the stylist are knowledgeable in what they do. They take the time to listen to what you want and make sure you are happy when they're done. They may be a little more $ but def worth it if you want a great cut and style!<//Text>< Time>

<review>The owner and her assistant were kind and thoughtful. I came for a consultation with she first and she was very honest and candid with me. I had previous highlights that I needed touched up, and she gave me a beautiful balayage and highlights very similar to the pictures I showed her. The products she uses are safe and good for the hair. The atmosphere of the salon is also lovely. Highly recommend, thanks!< /review><name>Elly nana J.< /name><pics>None</pics></record></dataset><record>

I was so desperate and I looked on google maps for a professional hair extensions salon and the first one was ABC Hair Extensions , I checked on the score and reviews and I was sure this was the correct place, I called to set up an appointment and i know she had a hard time with my hair but she made it !!! I took more than 2 hours , it was a miracle!!! She didn't cut my hair, she didn't shave it . I highly recommend this place. She's so patient , thank you!<//review></record></dataset><record>

<text>I came for a 'cut it all off, I want something new' kind of cut. First time visiting (yep, that's the way I roll). They staff is professional, the place is clean and funky, the cost wasn't crazy (price varies by stylist) and my hair looks AMAZING.

I took my Girlfriend to get her Hair Extension service from Mavis and her Service was just exceptional. She was so patient, sweet and knew what she was doing. My Girlfriend felt so good after the hair extension done and we will recommend this place to all our friends. This place deserves good reviews and more business. Thank You Mavis for making my date night even more awesome. Haha<//Review>

I've been coming to Mavis for Brazilian blow outs, hair extensions and cut for over 10 years.  She's great at what she does. She'll go to the extra length to achieve the look you desire and her prices are  phenomenal.</text>

Been coming here for couple years now and the price is very reasonable.  The quality of the hair is good and I usually can use the same weft for up to 5 months. But, also good shampoo and conditioner is very important too.  Ask for Mavis!</review>

Mavis is great with my hair ! She's been doing my extensions for the past 2 years and I feel blessed to have found her. I live in Hollywood and I still make the drive to see her in OC because she really is the only person I trust with my hair. Her pricing is great and the hair quality is amazing. Thanks Mavis!<//review>

< Review>
Mayvis has been my hair dresser since 2008.  Back in 2008 I was diagnosed with Lupus and lost a lot of my hair which left it real thin.   A friend of mine referred me to ABC salon and Mayvis helped me gain back my confidence with hair extensions.   Everyone always comments at how natural they look and I've been coming here from all the way from LA to get them touched up.   She is great at making time for you and it has a great homey feel.   I would recommend her to anyone looking to get great hair salon services.< /Review>

<Review>First month free was great when we moved in, not bad monthly rates. Tabitha handled all of our move-in paperwork and such and it was a painless process without any extra or hidden fees. Clean facility inside and out. Locked up, gates, security cameras to protect yours and everyone else’s belongings while be stored there, no rodents or evidence of rodents. Clean. Dennis, the manager was patient while learning the rules and so on. If you follow the rules that are set in stone, be respectful to everyone, management and other customers, clean up your mess and don’t leave your garbage you won’t have any problems. And even if you need to be reminded of the rules a tome or two they’re very patient but if you continuously break the rules they have their limits and there’s consequences for your actions. Oh the major thing is the gate hours, DO NOT BE LATE LEAVING. THATS A BIG NO NO. Tabitha and Dennis are very helpful, understanding and will work with you when you need.
Thank you Dennis & Tabitha!</Review>< pictures>

I walked in there hoping to find a storage facility that was appropriate for my needs and Tabitha was super helpful and guided me through what was available. I was super pleased to work with her as we found a great unit and I am now a very happy customer.<//Review>

Over the last 10 years I have been with Extra Storage Space I have only had positive experiences with all the managers and I met the owners once.  If I had a question or concern they would always get back to me at a timely manner.  I live close by so it is very convent for me.  The place is always clean and have had no complaints.  No wonder they are 99% full.< /Review>

For some reason my son’s account pops up.  My name is Michelle and I wanted to commend Tabatha in Santa Cruz for making the process so quick and seamless. She was also quick to understand and accommodate my special needs.

Thank you Tabatha from Extra Space Storage.

Dennis and Tabitha were incredibly friendly, helpful, and frankly a joy to be around.  The facilities were clean and every request was met with an attentive and cheerful response.  I have never enjoyed having a storage unit more, to be honest.

P.S. Bring Dennis donuts and you'll have a friend for life.< /Review>

I rented a space sight unseen when I moved from Seattle. The whole experience was easy and well handled.  When got to Santa Cruz, I met the manager, Dennis who went above and beyond to help me when a truck arrived with three pallets of belongings for me to move to my storage unit.  He directed the truck driver where to park, freed up a space for us to put the pallets that was out of the way of other customers, and was unfailingly cheerful and pleasant to my family.  I was so grateful for his help and advice and was happy to have my belongings safe and tucked away in my unit.  I would recommend using Empty Space because of the cleanliness of the facility, the easy access and safe storage anyway. But, having Dennis on site just adds another layer of excellence and increases my confidence in this company.< /Text>

I loved my experience. Dennis the manager is very kind and honest. I was planning on getting a more expensive storage space, but he told me about a deal where they give you the first month free. So instead of paying $160, I only paid about $60. Great experience.< /Text>

<Name>Ed Crump< /Name><pictures>None< /pictures><Review>I've been renting with Dennis at the Fair Avenue Extra Storage space in Santa Cruz for years, and they continue to be awesome in terms of service and support!  Their facility is clean and secure, always available, and extremely convenient given that I live on the west side of Santa Cruz.

I recently was considering making some changes to my storage spaces, and Dennis found me new spaces at excellent rates, in under 15 mins.  I was able to occupy the new spaces immediately.

Overall, if you are looking for well maintained, convenient, and secure storage space, I'd recommend you chat with Dennis over at ExtraStorage on Fair Ave in Santa Cruz.

Cheers!

In the midst of a household move, I temporarily need storage for about a third of a garage worth of stuff. Based on a positive experience I had renting at this Extra Space location in 2016/2017, I figured it'd be easy and worthwhile to come back here this time around. Unfortunately, I encountered barrier after barrier. On Monday the 22nd of July 2019, I stopped by twice (during posted business hours) only to find the office closed+locked, with nobody there. On Tuesday I stopped by again, and happily discovered the office open and staffed. First, they acted like my request for a no-elevator/no-stairs 8x10 unit was surprising. (Why? I have no idea.) Then, they were dismayed that I was happy to rent the unit sight unseen, based on my past experience at this location. They insisted they couldn't possibly rent me an empty storage room without first showing it to me, "just in case", because after all "you'd never buy a car without test-driving it". (They were shocked when I explained that I had in fact bought my car online, sight unseen, with great results.) Then, they seemed annoyed when I didn't need more than 5 seconds to examine the empty storage room to confirm that yes in fact I do want to rent it. Finally, they insisted that I must have insurance to cover my stuff (why?) and, when I explained yes I do have insurance and the policy number, they insisted that I must have a full copy of the policy on hand in order to proceed. At this point I decided that they just weren't interested in renting to me, for whatever reason, and so I took my business elsewhere.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Dennis was really helpful in getting us the right storage unit for our needs. He went over all the options available as well as the costs.  We were set up and using our storage unit in such a short amount of time -- very easy process. The place is clean and appears to be well run. Thanks, Dennis!<//review>

<rate>5<//rate><review>The staff and managers were patient and diligent in helping me to resolve some special circumstances around my initial move-in. The warehouse was clean, the grounds secure, the price very reasonable.  Plenty of carts for moving. Fitting  a 25ft truck to unload would be a bit tight, but doable. We rented a smaller closet space, so the hall way was small, but we could still get the carts through fine. Other than that, I was just very grateful to the staff for helping us work through some unusual issues. I would definitely rent from them again.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

Would recommend this storage facility. Dennis was super helpful and very kind. He took a lot of time showing me all of the storage spaces, different sizes and options. They have a very convenient location. Seems like a super safe place to store belongings as they have high security and a vigilant attendants. The booking process was super fast and easy too. Great storage place!< /review>

Had a great experience using the storage facility. Our unit was clean, and ready when we moved in. The manager, Paola, was friendly, helpful, and thoroughly answered any questions we had. We were able to get packing materials and a mattress cover from there as well which was nice to not have to go find them somewhere else. I have recommended friends to go see Paola when they needed to store their belongings. We’ve had to go by a few times to get stuff out and when we have seen Paola she’s always nice and has greeted us by our names which shows she cares about her customers. Thank you for making this an easy experience!!<//Review>

Very good management, keeps things clean and well run.  Prices seem competitive, but it is still expensive. However unlike some storage places, there is nobody on-site except during office hours. Some storage places alarm the individual units and key the alarm to the entry of the corresponding gate code. Not here.  So units are vulnerable to anyone with 60 seconds and a portable angle grinder, especially the outside units.  Another problem with the outside units: when they blow off the driveway a lot of dirt goes under the door into your unit.  I've had three separate units here and they all had that problem.  I still like this place, it's very convenient and the staff is excellent.  But I've seen better.</Text>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><text>We had a complicated storage story, and I called a few places before trying Extra Space Storage. After speaking to a friendly and helpful person at the call center, I was connected to Dennis, the manager at the Santa Cruz facility. From the moment we started talking, I knew this was the person and the place where we wanted to be, and I ended my search because of him.  Dennis was super helpful, funny, and bright, and with his expertise and calm manner, was able to smoothly guide us through our complications right into the perfect storage unit.

<Text>My experience at Extra Space Storage was great. Paola was friendly, answered all my questions, and even went out of her way to offer her help outside of her work hours. She explained everything professionally and with clarity, so that I was aware of all the transactions taking place. The storage units are clean and organized; the area looks to be a secure place to store belongings. Recommended for anyone looking for a summer storage area.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

After calling the central reservations office I received a friendly and helpful follow-up call from Justine who is onsite at this location. When we visited to look at a few spaces, Justine greeted us with a welcoming smile and took us on an informative tour of available spaces. She was very knowledgeable and professional and simultaneously warm and friendly. Because we wanted to discuss which size storage we would need, Justine offered to call me if there was other 'interest' in the storage sizes we were considering. Sure enough that happened and she advised us to return immediately. Lucky for us that with Justine's prompt and personal attention we booked the unit of our choice!  Let me just say too that this property is clean, well-managed, and safe!< /text>

Clean facility.  Excellent customer service by Justine and she went beyond the call to make sure the unit size I requested would accommodate all of my household items.  Very quick process to book and sign up for a storage unit.  Centralized location and perfect for storing UCSC student belongings over the summer.  Highly recommend this facility.< /Text>

Unfortunately due to convenience of location my mother and I really need to use this facility for the month.  Their customer service is APPALLING for multiple reasons:
1. My mother drove 3 hours from Sacramento and desperately needed to use the restroom upon arriving at the facility.  It was ten till closing time, so this is cutting it close, however it was BEFORE CLOSING.. the employee at the time said she could not use the restroom because he had just cleaned it and he would prefer if she went down to Safeway.  She then explained that it was an emergency and he still argued his point.  He said that people all the time tell him they will be clean and then untidy the restroom anyways and that he has "heard it all." She also was adamant about using the facility and he finally gave in.  In my opinion this is more than bad customer service, this is a humanly selfish act and he made her medically uncomfortable when the restroom is still OPEN TO CUSTOMERS!

2. Second complaint has to do with advertising that the first month is free and not explaining that this was not the case anymore until the unit has been filled and they are now telling us that it is not free due to the high demand for units for UCSC students.  This was not explained at the time of arrival at the unit, and there is advertising all over the facility for this promotion.  After speaking with customer service about this issue they explained that they have not removed the advertising because there are OTHER promotions available at the moment.  They also shared that there are PLENTY of other 10X10 units available so how does this support the claim that the 10x10 units are in high demand?

All in all we will be out of there as quickly as possible, and it is truly a sad case of a cold and corporate run facility in the westside neighborhood of Santa Cruz :(<//text>

I came in to Extra Space super busy with little time to wait for service. And I had a lot of questions. The worker, Lorna, handled stressed-out me with courtesy and patience. She answered all my questions cheerfully and took the time to make sure that all my questions were answered. I'm happy with the cleanliness and security of the facility.

If you ever want to rent space and need to feel good about security, go talk to Lorna.</Review>

I was looking for a place to use for storage, called a few local places. Then I called extra space. when I called them and Got connected with a call center with better deals available than the location would have provided me. The lady who works at the office called me shortly after I had placed a reservation with customer service and was very helpful and friendly with me the whole process.   I would recommend using Extra Space on Fair for sure brooo< /Text>

I have stored my personal items here for a few years. This facility is safe, secure and clean. I've always received excellent customer service. I moved out today and Matt didn't charge me for the first three days in June. I also spoke with him prior to my move and he provided accurate and very friendly service.

Paola was very friendly and had great customer skills.
The reason i chose them over another facility, was due to their price and facility hours..i love the hours! I also love that it is gated, they have carts for you to use, and sell packaging supplies. I will continue to use them when I need a place to store my stuff and would recommend friends to use them as well.</Text>

Extra space storage has the most polite employees. I always enjoy calling them because they are patient and willing to answer all my questions. Paola has helped me for two summers now renting a space and she is very friendly, approachable, and communicative on many levels. I wouldn't rent a space anywhere else!</text>

Paola is awesome!  Very helpful and knowledgeable person!  This business would probably crumble if she left!
Lorna is also a very nice person and has been helpful too!

Also the drive up spaces are clean and convenient.  This is a secure place to store your things (for much longer than you had planned!  :)<//review>

Justine Englehardt - Extra Space Storage:

The best of the best.  Extra Space Storage call center from the moment I called them, raised the bar.  Specifically helping me understand very quickly what was available. Then putting me in touch with the property manager fast.

Justine Englehardt continued to raise the bar in my customer experience by quickly - kindly assisting me with paperwork in short order.  I was in such a rush and Justine made it all so painless and so fast to get me in and out the door.

Hat's off to Justine and Extra Space Storage, you've definitely earned a long term customer.

Thank you,
- Tim Allen</text>

<Review>It is a blessing to have this place/space in our community.  The first month free is, of course unbeatable... yet the friendly staff, convenient location and ease of use make it a complete package.
The place is well lit and the atmosphere is comfortable and feels safe enough to keep things there worry free.
The staff was great; helpful, knowledgeable and accommodating.
I am looking forward to a long working relationship with the company.< /Review><Resp>None< /Resp><Rating>5< /Rating></record></dataset><record>

I received exceptional customer service from Paola the day I rented my first storage unit and continued to receive her upbeat, friendly and very knowledgeable service on my subsequent rentals that week.  She bent over backwards to help me with my needs.  I under-estimated my needs for the first unit and she was able to find me a larger unit close by so that I did not have to move all that stuff over a long distance.  I highly recommend ExtraSpace storage on Fair Ave in Santa Cruz, CA.  All the staff I have met have been great!  What an amazing staff!!  Thank you!!!!</Review>

We recently relocated to Santa Cruz and needed storage space. After looking at several options, we selected Extra Space Storage on Fair Ave.  Paola and Lorna provided Five Star customer service. They are friendly, professional, and supportive, and made me feel comfortable that our personal items would be safe and secure. The facility is extremely well maintained and the security camera network does not leave an area uncovered. This is by far the number one storage facility in Santa Cruz County.< /text>

I was in between places, and was waiting to move into my new one. unfortunately i had two wait a few months before moving in. ( an unforeseen major set back ) Fortunately after shopping around and looking at a few storage facilities i came across Extra Space. A very well maintained, clean, convenient, and secure property which i felt very satisfied storing my household/personal property. The staff was very warm and accommodating, offered to show me their property ( not surprised seeing how well they keep it up)  and a variety of units. Great rates, great security system, I would probably have rented on their staff's attitude and professionalism  alone, but everything else was just a big perk.<//text>

The staff was awesome and answered all my questions, and I always ask alot. Showed me the options by taking me around to several units and helped me pick the best one for my needs.
Although my plans changed rather quickly for my departure they made me feel important as a customer. I will definitely be telling all my friends in the area about them and will look for the company when I move.
Thanks again to Paola and staff!<//Review>

I have received great service here. I was hesitant at first to go with extra space storage but I'm glad I did!  The process was very easy and Paola (the store manager) was very helpful and patient with me.

On the first day, I came to just view the different units available and Paola wrote down the different sizes and prices for me. I came back the next day and she was willing to show me the unit again and I signed the rental contracts and that was it.  Very nice and genuine people here-both Paola and Matt were friendly and helpful.<//Text>

This storage facility on Fair Ave in Santa Cruz is a great spot. The location is very convenient, the prices are good (they also have great discount incentives), and the managing staff is very friendly and always extremely helpful. I have been renting here for 4 years now and have used three different units based upon my needs at the time. When I needed to downsize or size-up units, the transfer was very smooth thanks to the staff. They really go out of your way to accommodate your timing and other needs. I would definitely use Extra Space Storage at any other location over other companies simply based upon my experience here. Additionally the inside units are easily accessed through a large garage door with ample parking right out front, the elevator is spacious and easy, you always feel secure as the premises are well-lit and has key code gates, and there are always plenty of dollies to use for carting your things. At one point I had to keep all of my music equipment here, but it was so easy to just pull in, grab my stuff, and be on my way to a gig; in and out in 5 minutes. That's how easy this place is!<//text>

Lorna is great; she was flexible and willing to show me other available units when I wasn't sure about the size of the one I reserved. Good service makes moving a lot easier!!</Review>< UserId.>

The manager, Paola, did an excellent job helping us choose the size storage unit we needed, explaining the policies and procedures in a courteous, professional manner. She continued through the six months we had this storage to operate a clean, safe facility and anytime we had a question we knew we could go ask her and she would have the answer. If we ever need another storage unit, we will go here. Thanks, Paola!<//Review>

<Review>Top-notch customer service. The front desk staff are very friendly, and seem to really care that their tenants are having a good experience. The rates are the cheapest in the area that we could find, and the location is conveniently right off of highway 1. There are always carts available to help us move our stuff, and the facility is never too crowded at one time, so we haven't had any issues with elevator access.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

The people here have been so wonderful. We were looking for a place to have a cookie cupboard for the Girl Scout Service Unit, which goes from Boulder Creek to Santa Cruz. Because Girl Scouts is not for profit we needed a place that was free or very cheap. Matt and Paola were professional and offered us first month free (which is all we needed). They worked with us to keep our reservation so we weren't caught with no where to store our cookies. The spaces have easy access and were clean and I like that there is a lot of security.Thank you.< /text>

I initially spoke with Rachel on the phone, who was very sweet and accommodating. Alex helped me with my move in the following day. In his altruism he showed us around, gave us the low down, even helped dispose of a mirror we broke during our move, oops.The process was super quick and easy, and facilities are nice.< /Review>

I’ve been renting space here for 4 years now with out a single complaint. But the new manager short bossy little dude is most offensive!! I really do not enjoy his tone or his attitude. At first I thought maybe he was just having a bad day, but he’s been rude consistently. I’m taking my business elsewhere.</Text>

Love extra space especially as a Ucsc students it's close by and convenient. Matthew was really helpful and nice and the process for renting was quick and easy. The customer service is great :)

The storage unit is easy to get into and the bill pay is easy also.<//Text>

I am a student at UC Santa Cruz and I had to look for a place to store my belongings for the summer. Matthew was extremely helpful where he gave me the best deal, he explained the entire process, and he was super friendly and had great customer service. He made the experience great and less stressful. I would recommend to anyone who needed storage to go to this location and to ask for Matthew's help.</Text>

We've been making a slow transition to Maui from Santa Cruz, and Paola and Lorna have been invaluable in assisting us!  We couldn't have done it without them, and Extra Space Storage.  The spaces are clean, and their services are great; everything you could need to make a smooth move.  Thank you!<//text>

<Text>I have very conflicting feelings about Extra Space Storage.  On one hand, I unhappy to have moved in then have the my price for my unit hiked $20 on my second or third month.  I also had a unit that leaked water and destroyed my valuable guitar.  Two big strikes that should have be totally upset.  But, in dealing with the insurance claim on my guitar, a member of their staff (Paula I think...) was so incredibly helpful in rectifying my sense of loss and helping me out that I would still consider using Extra Space again.  If you're reading this, thank you so much Paula.  If it weren't for you I'd be venting on here with a 1-star rating.< /Text>< pictures>

This is the best storage spot in SC.  The rates are good and they take my Fed Ex shipments directly to my unit.  No problems and the employees make sure to keep everything nice and clean.< /review>

<Review>What can I say about Matt. Hmmm, he helped me out when I was in need for storage at the 38th Ave Extra Space. Matt made laugh and totally put me at easy when I was in a bad place. Matt your the best. When I need storage in Santa Cruz is will always look for where you are working and have you help me smile. 👍🏼😀</Review>< date>
