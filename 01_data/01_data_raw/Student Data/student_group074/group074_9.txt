Great winery to do a tasting. What’s neat is they let you pick what you’d like to taste and they have a broad selection. They also have cheese boards which are a tad overpriced considering they get them next door but are still delicious. Overall great ambiance, broad selection and great location at the heart of Sonoma.<//Review>

Just found my experience unremarkable in every way. The service was mediocre. Literally no interaction or explanation of the wines. They just bring it to the table. Wine was decent but pricey for my 1oz tasters. what I found particularly underwhelming- choice of glassware and plating. Just blah.... For a vineyard that produces wines with good marks, this tasting was not what I was hoping for.</review>

My husband and I first visited Roche winery in the early 90's when we lived in Detroit. On a yearly basis, we would order a case of the tamerex wine to remind us of the good time we had back then. Since moving to Florida 8 yrs. ago, we haven't  placed an order. Last week, after reminiscing about Roche winery, we called and placed an order.  We asked Dave, who took our order, to email the shipping number so we could track our order. (The shipping cost $63.00). We made this request 3 times. Although he said he would, Dave never extended this small courtesy. This will be the last order we will ever purchase from Roche. Perhaps $360 is not a lot of money to Dave or Roche wineries, but it is to us. I could've bought 2 cases of white merlot for  that price.
NEVER MORE!<//Review>

Strange tasting experience.  Our server was not very familiar with the wines and didn’t tell us about each before pouring.  The atmosphere is relaxed but seems dirty.  2 Stars for a very affordable tasting and decent wine for the price.  $20 tasting fee waived with one bottle purchase.  Bottles range from low $20s to mid $30s.<//review>

<review>A lovely place for wine tasting. We had a two for one coupon for tastings, but that was waived with the bottles of wine we got. They had sweet dessert wine here, so I was happy. The person pouring our wine was very knowledgeable and gave us a few “extra” tastes.< /review>< Pics>

My favorite winery, one of the few wineries that carries late harvest wines. If you prefer sweet wines this is the place for you, tastings range from $20-$30, waived if you purchase bottles. Outdoor and indoor bars, friendly staff.</review>

Loved my experience here. First day open after the COVID 19 closure. Host was friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. Tasted 2 wines and bought several bottles of both, along with joining the CARNEROS CLUB wine club. Shipping to my home state of NY. Looking forward to the selections for my next shipment!</Text>

Wonderful family winery! Close to the Sonoma Plaza. Outdoor seating. They put up a tent in the winter so you can still enjoy the outdoor setting. Super duper friendly staff! They also have a bit of a gift shop and some snacks.</review>

The wine testing was really nice. They have a great space to relax and a welcoming staff that is very informative, teaching about their wines and the Sonoma region in general. We joined their wine club, and after a few difficulties with our deliveries, Kyle worked with us to get it resolved. We're looking forward to enjoying our next shipment. Thanks.<//text>

The pours were generous, the patio was amazing in June weather, and we decided we do like Chardonnay at this winery because the wine was just that good! We would definitely go back and look forward to when their vineyard tasting room opens.< /review>< Pictures>

We came here after visiting a few other tasting rooms near the Sonoma plaza and having a not so good experience. Roche was like a breath of fresh air! The staff was incredibly friendly, gave us generous pours, let us try a few reserve wines, and just generally made us feel welcome. Can't recommend it highly enough!<//review>

The staff was friendly and the atmosphere extremely chill.  7pm, its a decent place to close out the evening before heading for dinner.

Although they are known for prize winning Chardonnay, I have always enjoyed their reds (Pinot Noir and especially their Merlot). They have made a great Cabernet in the past but haven't made one for quite a while. Not to be missed is their late harvest Merlot (a nice desert wine). They have great customer service.<//text>

<rate>1< /rate><review>We have been wrongly charged twice. Each time it takes days to straighten out because the winery wont return calls. Multiple unauthorized charges are a constant headache. Our account manager Kyle is unresponsive and his customer service skills are seriously lacking. The winery response was to refund our money AGAIN! Nice but this was after I asked to close our account. Someone should tell these people that a free bottle, an apology, and no bs excuse would've kept us as customers. Great wine worst customer service on planet.</review>< Pics>

A radiant sun!
On this last day, we decide to go for a walk in the city of Sonoma and we come across this vineyard with a terrace in full sun. A wonder. We like to be warm on January 3. The service is very courteous, the glasses of wine are full, the pinot noir is good and the rosé is succulent. The best place to have a drink in Sonoma.

Un soleil radieux!
En cette dernière journée, nous décidons d'aller faire un tour dans la ville de Sonoma et nous tombons sur ce vignoble avec une terrasse plein soleil. Une merveille. On aime ça avoir chaud le 3 janvier. Le service est très courtois, les verres de vin sont bien remplis, le pinot noir est bon et le rosé est succulent. Le meilleur endroit pour prendre un verre à Sonoma.<//text>< GmapID>

<text>This is the 2nd car Christian has detailed for us. He did an incredible job on my husbands GT350 last time, and delivered the same results again on my mustang. He is very professional and courteous. The car looks absolutely amazing. Washing a car has also never been easier after Christian applies a ceramic coat. Nothing sticks to the car and the water rolls right off. Even if you take good care of your car, nothing can beat how it looks once Christian is done with it.< /text><Name>Alexa Gray</Name><gmap_id>0x808329ccbc7ba3cb:0x5059e74aaef05eed<//gmap_id>< rating>

<review>Christian was very professional and did an excellent job on our 4-year old Hyundai Elantra Sport!

I went in knowing it'd look at least marginally better but was blown away with the results. After it being clay-barred and polished it shines SO well in the sun! The interior looks 10x better and with the protectant on it I'm sure will have a better life!

The first thoughts after seeing it so clean for me was they even did little details like polishing the door sill plates and even the exhaust tips and did above and beyond at taking clear coat scratching out from previous automatic car washes.

Thank you so much Christian, and I appreciate the advice you and your employee gave about washing rituals and maintaining the look as long as possible as well. :) You guys were great!</review>< Pictures>

<Review>Christian's employee did a fantastic job detailing my 2013 Rav4 that had been sorely neglected.  It looks and smells almost brand new! Christian was honest when I asked about buffing out my headlight lenses.  He told me it would be cheaper to replace then fix them.  He sent a link where I could find them at a great price and said he could install them! What outstanding, hardworking young men!< /Review><response>None<//response>< Time>

The owner of Top Tier did a fantastic job with my car. He made it look as good as it possibly could have. I would highly recommend supporting this local business. Very professional, very down to earth.<//Review>

<Text>Christian with Top Tier took my SUV which had been covered from head to toe in clear coat scratching (thanks, storm) and made it look like the day I drove it off the lot! I was blown away when I saw the results. Not only did he remove the scratching I requested but also prior water spotting and swirls in the paint. He even made the tires shine! I would recommend Top Tier to anyone. Very friendly, prompt, fair and produced great results!<//Text>< Pictures>

Christian from Top Tier Auto Detailing made my 2019 Subaru Ascent look like new again.  I had a few annoying scratches on my car that he blended back into the paint nicely.  I'll will definitely use his business again for future detailing jobs. I'm looking forward to have him detail the inside of my car and engine next.  Here are a few photos from his job!</Text>

Wonderful wonderful job done by the guys at Top Tier. My car was filthy from dogs, kids, and my own doing. My husband’s truck was a mess from work (dust, dirt, mud, chemicals) as well as kids and dogs. We could not be happier with the job these guys did. Our cars look brand new which is saying a lot of my car. I never post reviews but had to based on the great work done. I would HIGHLY recommend them to anyone. Well worth every penny spent and then some!</text>

Christian was very professional!  His communication was timely, courteous and respectful.  He went above and beyond what I expected. I wanted my engine compartment steam cleaned so I could locate an oil leak. To my surprise he returned my 23 year old leaky Jeep engine to off the lot new!   He also cleaned my tire rims and they really pop!   I am looking forward to working with him again on the interior out of my jeep.<//Text>

Tried to make an appointment but they were too busy. Over the phone service was impeccable and extremely polite. Christian very quickly provided me with a quote. This place is very clearly one of the far and few between the reputable and disreputable businesses here in Chico. 10/10 would recommend just on customer service.<//review>

The wheels were so road rashed I thought they were a lost cause but Top Tier brought them back, almost look new. The body nicely waxed and finished to new luster. Like looking at a glass finish. Thank you Chris for meeting my tough schedule. And hat's off to your co-worker Dago. Very friendly, polite. Thanks guys!! c me in 6months or??

<Review>I must say, Christian was so polite and professional! I was in Chico on business and called on the weekend, spur of the moment to see if he could fit one or two vehicles in within the next few days. He called right back and was willing to do them both on Sun! Both vehicles look incredible, and I couldn't be happier! I'll definitely be contacting him again in the future.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

As a local small business, we love meeting and supporting other local businesses. Christian at Top Tier is the best in the auto detailing business. We were completely blown away by his professionalism, dedication to quality, and his passion for the work he does. He is very knowledgeable and went above and beyond for us. We had 2 Ford Raptors detailed and coated in ceramic. The trucks look better than they did when the left the Ford dealership. We were so impressed by him and his work, we are now having other personal cars done along with using him through our business.

Thank you Top Tier! You exceeded our expectations!< /text>

Great service! I got a basic exterior/interior detail and it looks just it did the day I drove it off the lot, EXCEPT BETTER!! He knows what he is doing and his team is very experienced and professional. 12/10 would recommend again and is very reasonably priced. I will be using Top Tier for the foreseeable future.

<Text>INTELLIGENT PEOPLE...READ THIS!

If you love your car and want it to look brand new again, I highly recommend Top-Tier Auto Detailing.
My wife’s car looks unbelievable! Her car is 9 years old and Dago did a  fantastic job of restoring the car’s finish to brand new. I mean brand new!!! Truly, it hasn’t looked this good in years. He was able to remove swirl marks, hard water stains, and other blemishes. Her car has that shiny mirror finish again. This is the kind of detailing that takes a great deal of time. Dago takes pride in his work. This is not some 90min quickly. If you take pride in your car, let Top-Tier auto detailing keep your car at its best!</Text>< Gmap_id>

<review>Top Tier Auto Detail did an awesome job bringing out the true depth and luster in the black paint on my 2012 Infinity G37. Christian took the time to explain the process he would take to restore the paint to better than showroom condition. It wasn't a quick 1 hour detail, I was home for the process and he really takes his work seriously and does a thorough job. The price for the work done was more than fair! I would recommend Top Tier to anyone who wants a honest and excellent auto detail.< /review>< Date>

Christian, the owner, is fantastic. Incredibly kind and professional. My brand new car was hit by our sprinklers in Chico and we tried everything to get the water spots off my car to no avail. So, we called Top Tier and Christian came out and had the water spots off my car in no time! Best part, I wasn’t charged an arm and a leg for it!!! I will definitely be calling him for all my car detailing and cleaning from now on!< /review>

I've had Top Tier detail all of my family's vehicles and they never disappoint! I even had them detail my truck after I worked up on the camp fire for 10 days... I never thought I could get rid of the smoke smell in my interior. They got rid of it though! The level of clean is better than when you buy a brand new vehicle, Im not joking. What would take me days of cleaning my own truck, they can do in a few hours. Truly incredible. They are very professional and do their best to work around your schedule and are 100% mobile and definitely worth every penny!<//Text>

My experience with Top Tier was Amazing! Christian was punctual, professional, and performed absolutely the best detail work I have ever had done. My car was beyond my expectations.

Top tier did a fantastic job on my vehicle. Christian came out and looked at the vehicle in person to give me a quote. Then came back on time with his van and completed the work in the driveway. He walked me thru the car from top to bottom when he was done and was very knowledgeable about paint, leather upholstery, and aluminum trim. Going to have them back to do my other vehicle.</text>

Made a appointment with Christian to detail my car inside and out. I went with him because of all the good reviews and his price was reasonable. Made the appointment for November 2nd, on November 1st around 3pm he texted me to let me know he was sick and had to cancel our appointment. I texted back about 30 minutes later saying I understood that fully and thanked him for the heads up. He also mentioned in that text to let him know if I wanted to reschedule for a different day and I said YES let me know when he had open. After that point I never heard from him again. I’ve called, left voicemails and texted multiple times and haven’t heard back. Thinking maybe he was still sick I checked the company Instagram to see if there was any update from them. They had posted updates on washing cars for the last week. Completely unprofessional to just ignore my calls and texts.< /Text>

<Review>Top Tier is hands down the best vehicle detailing shop I have ever used. They have done two of our cars and now our RV trailer. Our boat is next on the list. I can’t say enough about how great of a job they do. I’m looking forward to seeing what the boat looks like when they are done. I recommend them to everyone.</Review><user_name>Kurtis Webber</user_name>< Rating>

They make sure to clean every square inch of your vehicle inside and out. I have a truck that I constantly go down muddy gravel roads that hasn’t been washed in 3 months. When I came back to see it in my driveway it looked like a brand new truck right off the lot. I highly recommend these guys if you want the best quality all around in an auto detail.</Text><user_name>Kevin Campos< /user_name>< Pictures>

<Text>Christian is amazing! Showed up right on time, gave a very reasonable estimate before he got started, and was finished in 1.5 hours! And that was working solo, as his coworker was out sick. My car looked incredible. Shiny like new and not one water spot left, which was my original concern. Every aspect of the exterior of my vehicle was touched to perfection. Couldn’t be happier! Would recommend again and again!<//Text><gmap_id>0x808329ccbc7ba3cb:0x5059e74aaef05eed</gmap_id>< resp>

Very professional, Would highly recommend using Top Tier detailing for your detailing needs. My Durango looks fantastic.  Everybody knows how black is a very unforgiving color. It looks better today than when I bought it. All fine line scratches are gone. Will be using Top Tier for my boat next
Thank you Christian. 😊👍< /Review>

<review>My 2016 Toyota Tacoma is my baby and the water spots from my apartment complex sprinkler was making her look rather faded on the tail gate and bumper. Through the recommendation of a friend I tried Top Tier to see what they do.  Christian was professional, honest, and now my truck looks like she just rolled off the lot!  Thank you SO MUCH Christian!  It was worth the drive from Red Bluff.  I’ll be back!</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

I could not be more impressed with the work that they did.  It was very easy to book an appointment and they came right to my house.  They were quick, but payed attention to the little details and didn’t miss a thing. Hands down the best customer service and best detail my trucks ever gotten.</Review>

<Text>I wish I could post photos!  Christian left it looking better than it did coming out of the dealership and pulled every hard water spot out— the street even reflects off of it.  From the time I called, received a quote, and had the service completed, it was less than 24 hours and having him come to my home is such an appreciated convenience.   Between this exterior work today and the interior detailing he did for a prior car, he’s proven to be someone who takes pride in what he does.  I look forward to the opportunity to refer to him!< /Text><date>1570304079935< /date></record>

Just got my car detailed for the first time, and I am more than happy with the finished results! I’ve followed their work on Instagram and always was impressed by the work that was done. I finally decided it was my turn to get my car done, and I am very happy with it! My car looks like a brand new car and is shining bright in the sun! 10/10 recommend  you giving them a call! You won’t be disappointed!! :)   I am very happy!< /Text>

<review>I had my truck detailed by Top Tier for the first time and I was completely blown away with the results. Christian was able to get rid of the swirls on the paint and take out water spots with no problem. He is very detailed when it come to the small stuff. My deep dish wheels had a thick layer of brake dust built up and he was able to make them look brand new again. His work is hands down the best. Wouldn’t go to anyone else but Top Tier.<//review>< rating>

Very cool guy! Called early in the morning and was able to get the detail in by 10. Came to my house to do the detail which was very convenient. A little over two hours and my Cadillac was brought back to life! Couldn't believe how great the car came out after having such bad water spots for over a few months. Amazing results and will highly recommend to anyone looking for a great car detail!< /Review>

<review>Christian and his team at top tier are true masters of their trade. What is most outstanding about this company as compared to many other detailers I had inquired with is the diversity of the services offered, top tier has packages that clean and shine my fleet work trucks at great prices but Christian also possesses the skills and knowledge to apply high end protective coatings on my slightly more valuable cars (black 69 Chevelle SS, 2016 hellcat charger, and my GT3 RS). I will exclusively use and recommend top tier for all automotive detailing services from here on out.
Rock on and god bless

Honestly the best Detailer here in the North State! He provides the best quality, knows what he is doing and has wonderful cleaning products! He even shows up to your house or work! He’s amazing and went above and beyond what I expected my car to look like when it was done. He worked on my 2017 Subaru STI and it came out amazing, I was speechless! He’s detailed many of my other cars also! If you are looking for quality and someone who will work with you and have everything done in a timely manor, please contact Top Tier Detailing and you won’t regret it!< /review>

Top tier is very prompt and professional.  Christian's communication is on point!  The staff worked all day on the interior of my explorer and it looks great.</review>

< Review>
Hands down the best detail ive ever had!!! I had the WORST hard water stains on both my bumpers and paint which were no match for Top Tier! They were very thorough and professional to say the least, and not to mention how easy it was to book an appointment! I would highly recommend for any future details!</Review>

<Review>Simply the best! Top Tier helped remove water stains, deep scratches from my pup, and all the muddy paw prints and grime left on the interior of my car. It’s always a fair price, they exceed expectation and do a great job every time.</Review><Date>1547835762594<//Date><response>None</response><pictures>None< /pictures></record></dataset><record>

I dont know where to start with this
amazing business. I was in town visiting, came from the salt belt, maine, and was only in town for a week. They knew my concern with all the salt and got me in the next morning! Not only did I have the whole truck covered in salt, but i had hard water spots all over and black soot from my exhaust all over the tailgate. It was a disaster. Later that day they called me up and it was ready to go. Came out and was absolutely blown away! Looked better than off the lot! Highly recommend these guys if your from the chico area!<//review>

I was in desperate need of a detail for my Ford F-150 and Top Tier went above and beyond my expectations. I work full time and the convenience they provided by coming to me was perfect. Not only do they do great work but they are mobile. They have my business for life. Thanks Top Tier.<//Review>

It's easy to give 5 stars when everything gose great.  I think it's more telling of a business when things don't go smoothly and how the business responds.  We had a good size order for delivery and there was a mix up in communication between me and the young man taking the order thay caused some stress and anxiety.  Jessey, the owner, did a great job with customer service and rectifying the situation.  Greatly appreciate is efforts and everything turned out great.  Job well done.<//text>

Ordered delivery. Straight forward, no frills menu. Fluffy crust, not too sweet or salty. Not over saucy, sweeter sauce. Generous topping. Despite the pictures, the pizza is NOT GREASY. Loved it, can't wait to order again and highly recommend this hidden Tustin gem!< /review>

<Date>1614853280267</Date><Review>Every time I call to order delivery I simultaneously feel like both a VIP and 10-year-old child ordering pizza for the first time. Thank God their system pulls up my account when I call so they can easily reorder my favorite items. Simultaneously, they are so kind and patient when I ask them about the specials and inevitably order the same large pizza every. single. time.
10/10 taste and texture
10/10 kind and quick
8/10 cost (but support your local business here folks)</Review></record>

My boyfriend had always bragged about this place for their 75 cent pizza slice on Tuesdays (if I remember correctly) and came here ever since he was little, so I decided to give it a try. Ordered a medium pizza with pepperoni, sausage, and mushrooms. Man oh man, I never expected to get a good portion of toppings and the pizza was a perfect! Alot of pizza restaurants are stingy with how much toppings they put on your pizza, but this place gives you the perfect amount. I love the crust and overall, it was pure hot goodness! Service is great and they give a variety of deals! MUST COME!<//text>

Best pizza in Tustin. Amazing prices and deals; check out their website, they have coupons for days. Their large Caesar salad is only $6 and can seriously feed 4 as an appetizer. Can't wait for this place to reopen <3

Ps
We miss you so much Pizza Shack :'(<//review>

<Review>I must say the pizza here the best good ingredients well made pizza with friendly hard working staff always willing to answer questions. This is the only time I have bought pizza two days in a row. WOW! I can't wait to start picking apart the menu here. The rating should be upgraded to 4.7 or 4.8 in my book unfortunately the rating has been brought down by reviews with no substance similar to the pizza on Newport ave and Mitchell. Pizza Shack in Tustin has my complete and total endorsement!< /Review>< Pics>

Pizza Shack makes some seriously delicious pizza. It's probably the best pizza joint in Tustin. Tuesday's is the best time to make an order with the $0.75 cents a slice deal. You can get a whole large pepperoni or cheese pizza (10 slices) for like $7.00. Forget Taco Tuesday get yourself a large pizza for real. 😃</Review>

We recently ordered from this place for the first time after living in Tustin all our life and are mad at ourselves for not trying it sooner. It's so good! We've already ate from this place more than once and definitely plan on ordering from here again and again. I highly recommend their pizza.<//text>

<text>My wife brought home pizza from this place the other night. It was so delicious, best pizza I have tasted so far.  Had some the day after, had the same delicious taste. Most Pizzas overnight lose their flavor, not this one.< /text>< Pics>

Great tasting crust and quality toppings. Locally owned by an owner who supports the local schools and non-profits. We've been going here since the early 90's.<//Text>

<text>My favorite local pizza shop. They have a great Monday night special. 8.99 for a large one topping pizza. Can't beat that! The crust is great and it beats any chain pizza spot.</text><Response>None</Response>< Rate>

Best pizza in town!! Came here with my family and now I’m all grown up and started coming here with my boyfriend and friends and they love it!! They rather have this then any other pizza. There always a good vibe and it’s great for family’s or a night out with the friends or come here and watch games and have a beer. I would recommend anyone and everyone to come and try a piece of pizza. You will call in love!!!<//text>

The pizza was quite yummy here. It's definitely fast food style, very very greasy. The workers weren't friendly so that made the place a bit less enjoyable. Other than that, it was good for a pizza shack. Not quite sure if id recommend to anyone but it was tasty.< /Review>

<Review>They have some really great pizza love this place! Only thing I dislike is how they are stingy with there hot wings, sauce.... When u order wings they barely put enough sauce on them.... Don't get me wrong they are still pretty good but man u guys really need to put some sauce on them! That's also the only reason I gave the place 3 stars besides that, again the pizza in freaking awesome! Wings to! Lol</Review>< Pics>

My favorite spot for a slice of cheese in,CA The cheese pizza by the slice has perfectly thin crust, the sauce is very fresh and the cheese is the ideal consistency.</Text>

<rating>4<//rating><Text>While I've only ever eaten in there once many years ago, this is probably the best hole in the wall pizza around. The atmosphere is rather like a tavern, the beer selection, while not great, is very affordable, and the best part is they have pitchers. There are a few arcade games around but the selection is not good, but if you're waiting for a pie to cook they do have a tabletop pacman there which is a solid addition. If your tired of the big chains and want something better give it a try.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

The owner is super friendly and the pizza is great quality! Can't beat the price and this is one of my favorite places. Nothing like giving your money to a hard earned local pizza shop and not to a greedy multi million dollar corporation!</text>

This is a go to now. Takes a little bit but it is worth it and good eats take a little time. Couldn't be happier to be able to support the place and benefit from the light crust in just minutes.<//Text>

Great pizza no lie there, not very kid friendly the ambiance needs work. Place looks borderline depressing bar that happens to serve pizza. Highly recommend the food for take out.</Review>

Some pizza sauces give me "heart burn", but not the sauce from Pizza Shack!!!  Their red sauce is quite strong in taste but mild in my tummy.  The overall pizza quality is great, fresh ingredients for the toppings, they made the pizza just exactly the way I want.  Good Job!!!!!<//Text>

<text>Hands down best experience!! In the middle of writing a research paper my computer crashed. Not only did they save my file but they exchanged my laptop for a nicer, more efficient, and better quality laptop for a great price. Also, the team at Quality Plus worked until 9PM to get my laptop back to me so that I could finish and submit my paper that night. Talk about great customer service!! I will definitely be returning. Thank you Peter and Team Quality Plus. I am your new loyal customer.<//text>< pictures>

The best computer shop I have been to. The day the shop received the part I needed for my laptop, they finished the repair and called me. The repair was perfect, swift, and the service was fantastic. I only interacted with Peter, and he was incredible. He was very thorough, honest, and wonderful at his job. When I had my keyboard replaced, he took the time to transfer my stickers from the old board to the new board the same day he got the part. The price was realistic and way lower than any other shop I have been to, with 2x as good service and response times. Would highly recommend.<//Text>

Was very informative and friendly. Even though I was with alot of questions.

5 days later:.   Unfortunately my computer could not handle hardware I wanted to install in it. Peter and rest of technicians explained to me what had happened. They didn't try to cheat me or anything . They have definitely earned my trust. I recommend Peter and his associates in any case , whether an upgrade , a fix, or even ask them if something is there that is affordable you are looking for.   They have been there for a long time and it says alot about the integrity of them all.
I will be returning here on my next visit for there help.  Thank Quality Plus I really appreciate you.</Text>

Quality Plus Computer in Chino Hills is a hidden gem.  I've been buying my PCs and add-ons from them for almost 15 years and they have never let me down.  I've only needed two in that time by the way and the only reason I needed new ones is because I got to a point where my memory was full or my processor needed an update.
They are reasonable, capable, and completely dedicated to customer service.  You will not go wrong to take their advice on your computing needs.  They've earned my respect over many years.< /review>

Recently, I traded in my old laptop for one of their refurbished ones and they transferred all of my data very fast, and I ended up with a very good product. They have always been professional and efficient while providing quality work, and this is especially prevalent during these harsh times under quarantine and social distancing.</Review><Rating>5</Rating><Pics>None< /Pics>< Name>

They attend to you in a timely manner. There's a gentleman goes by the name Peter that works there and he is so respectful.  He will sometimes call me Pastor in a friendly manner. I highly recommend Quality Plus Computer in Chino Hills to anyone needing help with any kind of computer. They are the best in computer business. Kingsley< /Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>Great service. I messaged on yelp pricing & they got back to me right away. They took a look at my tower & since they had the supplies took a little over an hr. Awesome that have a warranty too.

I went in again to get a new hard drive for my tower and I'm so grateful for there service and the customer service is great. Shang remembered me from the last visit and remembered my name.  Again, was very helpful and knowledgeable.  I've been looking everywhere, online, and in stores for a certain keyboard style and they were able to help me with that as well.  with the great service, they are fast as well. to put in power supply it was only n hr and for the hard drive only a few hours. with other places, I would be scared to level my tower with them, but here I feel completely comfortable ith them. thank you so much again.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

Peter was amazing to deal with. Went above and beyond to make sure my MacBook was fixed and that all my files were safe. He fixed it all in just one day. Definitely THE place to go if you need your computer fixed.<//text>

Amazing service!!! I wish i could give these guys more than 5 stars! I brought in my Macbook and they had it fixed in less than 3 hours! Apple tried to charge me more than double their price and I would have been without my laptop for more than a week. Thank you!</Review>

I had a spectacular experience with Quality Plus Computer. My Razer Blade Laptop had a severe problem where it wouldn't boot up. I brought it in and the employees there were generous enough to provide me with a great deal where if they couldn't physically fix the problem they wouldn't even charge me for the diagnostic examination or any attempts done to repair my laptop. They were also very nice, and attempted to fix the problem THAT EXACT DAY in the span of a few hours! Definitely recommend!</Text>

I needed a quick fix on an older MacBook Pro. Peter looked it over, said it will be ready in 2 hours. Told me the price. Called me in 2 hours and could not have asked for better service and the price was great. No BS and no surprises. Thanks, Peter & the crew!<//review>

The people here are super helpful. I accidentally dropped my Dell PC and it stopped working during midterms. I was super desperate and needed a working computer to get through my last 2 midterms. In a span of like 2 days they were able to recover all my data files from the damaged harddrive, transfer them to an SSD, and  upload them to my new computer. They also lent me a PC to use during the time they were working to recover the data files and while I was waiting for the new replacement to arrive (thank God for insurance).Thank you to the team of guys that work here and a big thank you to the owner Peter. They were open and honest and gave me some peace of mind during an already stressful week of exams.< /text>

It's like your best friend has become an IT genius and is helping you with your concerns.  Fast, friendly, conscientious, honest, caring, concerned, knowledgeable, and reasonable.

I have been to many many computer shops, but Quality Plus Computers continues to impress. I have been dealing with the owner, Peter Dong for many years, and the one thing that stands out about this store and the owner is this: integrity. The key word here is honesty. Where do find such qualities in any business now days? I have never been over-charged. I have never been cheated. The prices are fantastic and the service is first-rate. They even do house-calls! Peter or Frank will actually come to your house or business to save you from computer death.

If Peter says that your computer or laptop will be done the next day....it is. When he orders you a part, it sometimes arrives the same day. Peter and the staff at Quality Plus Computers are extremely knowledgeable, and they are not condescending. They talk to you in easy language, and explain everything in great detail. They treat you like a person, not like a number.

The above reasons are why I continue to do business with Peter and Quality Plus. They always come through for me.

Oh, and one more thing: this is a Christian business. Enough said.</Text>

<Text>Quality Plus Computer is the absolute best! I had a laptop I use for work, that needed some hardware upgraded, as well as a tune up. Peter and his team recommended a great solid state drive and completely reworked my Dell laptop to make it much more efficient. The price for the upgrade and tune up were more than fair!

Since the repair was for the laptop that I use daily for my real estate business, I dropped it off at the end of the day and asked for a weekend turnaround time. Peter and his team went above and beyond, and had my laptop ready the next morning!!! Because of their professionalism, quality of work, and amazing customer service, Quality Plus Computers has earned my business for life! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND them to anyone in need of computer repairs, upgrades, and service.</Text><GmapID>0x80dccd483684cb75:0xc461a4f88941c1f2</GmapID></record>

A+, VERY reasonable prices when compared to ASN Depot, Best Buy Geek Squad or Franks PC Repair.  Fast same day service to trouble shoot and fix my gaming build with advanced lighting Hue+ system.  Unlike the others ESPECIALLY versus Best Buy, they stayed at their quoted price instead of giving you a "quote" then inflating the final price on their work.  They did excellent cable management, just showing their attention to detail.  These guys deserve your business.  No BS, quality work, on time, and exactly as quoted.< /review>

I have been doing business with Quality Plus Computer owned and operated by Peter Dong for more than 15 years. I would never consider going anywhere else for my business computers. Peter designs the computer specifically for my needs. The computers work flawlessly, and his personal warranty and guarantee of his products has always been dependable and reliable.

Peter and his staff are very friendly, respectful, and good listeners and will provide you an outstanding finished product. You will always leave his office with a smile on your face and have the desire to refer your friends to Peter's office to ensure their future satisfaction for all their computer needs.< /Text>

<text>Excellent service!  I have used them for over 10 years.  They have fixed 2 of our desktops and 3 laptops both PC and Apple!  When I was in a pinch, they were able to give me a reconditioned laptop for $150!  I still have it after 4 years.

They are honest and for a small company, they get the work done quickly and efficiently.  Twice they saved me from missing an important term paper.  They always under promise but over deliver. Yesterday, my Apple got spilled with water.  They told me that they can recover my data within 3 hours.  They did it in 30 minutes!

While they are fixing  my under one year old Apple, I went back to using my reconditioned PC I mentioned above.  What?  It had more than double the hard drive space than my over $2000 Apple! Now, they are doing their best to bring my MacPro to life.

They are patient, professional and very knowledgeable.

Thank you Frank, Peter, Ryan,Pyu!< /text>< Pictures>

<review>Life savers!!! Honest and awesome! I am currently an online student. I forgot the power cord at my friends house (2 hours away) to this Lenovo laptop I have been using. Therefore, I had to use the HP laptop, which I bought for school, but it had became very slow and the audio stopped working so I stopped using it. I had 12 hours to write a paper and I was in a bind! I brought the HP into them to see it they could quickly fix it so I could write my paper. After explaining the situation, the owner explained to me all the options. He suggested taking the HP back to were I purchased it because they had to fix it under warranty and to not waste my money paying for a repair that should be covered. He lent me a power cord for the Lenovo if I promised to bring it back. I was shocked and so grateful he offered to help me in this way! They are awesome!!</review><user_id>105643002668123277124</user_id>< rate>

I had excellent customer service at Quality Plus today.  I traded in an old Dell CPU for a gently used HP at a very reasonable cost.  In addition, all files were transferred from the old to the new, making for a seamless transition.  I look forward to doing business with the team at Quality Plus for all of our home and business needs.  Many thanks.< /review>

<Review>I had just recently bought a hard drive and needed a SATA data cable. I walked in and asked for one and how much it was and he just gave it to me for free. That is amazing service. I highly recommend dropping by if you need some help!<//Review>< Gmap_id>

< review>
The screen display on my HP Pavilion dv4-2160us laptop went out of service. They had it replaced within less than an hour after I brought it in at 4:45pm on the same day. The Management and Technicians of Quality Plus are always responsive to my needs. I have been a customer for three service incident, and plan to use them in the future. Best Buy's Geek Squad charges way too much. I recommend that you try them for your next service needs. They are very honest and charge you a fair price... way way low than what others will charge you.< /review>

Sometimes, I think, fixing these things is a bit of a guessing game, because many things may cause the same problem. If they can't fix it they don't charge except for their time and many times not even for that.  They know their computers and they do great work.</review>< pictures>

Have been using this company for troubleshooting problems, repairs, upgrades, and  system purchases for over 5 years. They are extremely timely,  fair, and courteous, I have recommended to friends who have thanked me for the referral. They have taken care of my business with their IT as well. I would be lost without them!< /text>

I needed four small screws to install an SSD in a laptop hard drive caddy. After wasting time looking at Wal-Mart and Home Depot, I found this shop online and gave them a call. Over the phone I was told they could give me free screws, part of their service to "society." I was surprised and a little incredulous but I decided to drive over. I was fixed up with free screws, a pleasant environment, and even a complimentary bottle of water. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone and I'll be going back if I ever need further services.</review>

< review>
Cool staff but some stuff way over priced. I purchased 60 pack coca nara $10.99 .. both liquor stores by my house sell same pack for $6.99 .. al fakher 50G small box $3.99 here .. liquor store by my house $2.99 ..if you're guys wanna compete with liquor stores drop your prices. Only reason I purchased here was because the liquor stores were out. Will never do business hookah wise here until they lower prices.</review>

Its not a bad shop, but you HAVE to check your peice before you leave. Twice now, I have been sold a peice that had a crack in the bowl. The first time, I saw it before I left and he exchanged it no problem. The second time, I didnt notice till after I was gone and it was just like "oh well Im stuck with it". Its about average pricing, maybe a little bit more on tbe pricier side, but its because they dont have a basic bowl, they have the fancy color ones. All in all, its an all right shop if youre in a pinch. But there are ones for a better value closer. Thanks.<//Text>

Cheapest place for a bite to eat. You could feed an army here on a budget. Lol the food is wonderful and prices are
Unbeatable. They also have the best ice.</review>

< review>
This food court never, never, answers their phone.  Anytime on the weekend to pick up pizza is at least a 50 minute wait.  I hate this food court for that reason.  Doesnt leave you with any option but to wait since they dont answer the phone.<//review>

This Costco food court is one of the worst ones ever. They always only have 1 line open with 30 people in line waiting to be served. Pizza is never cut all the way through and they love to mess up on your order and not care.< /text>

< review>
Food court is outside so no membership needed which for some is a plus the problem is that the line around peak times is a crazy wait and prepaying doesn’t seem to always help as the line on the day I was there was equally long for both...shopping at Costco you expect to wait, the process to pay for my phone call in pizza order ended up being a 20+ min wait. Food is good but just always too busy at this food court.</review>

<text>HORRIBLE PHONE SERVICE...... I called to placed an order for  3 pizzas 1st call, nobody answers -  2nd call - a lady answer, she said can you hold, I said YES... she hang up... so, I call 3rd time. ring 6 times finally someone answer and took my order...  so FRUSTRATING  waiting for them to pick up the phone and hanging at customer... COSTCO needs a  BETTER CUSTOMER SERVICE ON THE PHONE LINES.  Thank you!!!<//text>< pics>

<Review>This was the best place ever! Aaron stayed open late for me when he heard about my problem. He was very very nice and super knowledgeable! Best customer service I've had in a long long time! This company was on the money when they hired him and hope they realize what a gem they have with him! The prices are reasonable and the store has so many things its hard not to buy tons of stuff. I left spending $601.45 and was happy to pay that amount. Keep up the hard work Aaron!</Review>< Pics>

<review>The staff upon my visit was knowledgeable and fully present to help. They verified that the batteries I was replacing were indeed correct.
The site has good selection form small to large batteries, flashlight batteries of all kinds, hearing aids, car batteries, and some odd ones I've never seen before.
The parking lot is a little small (less than 10 spaces) but is mentioned as a note and not a detraction of the establishment.</review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x8085975b7f8fb665:0x4b5e7e03e2bf2c14< /gmap_id></record>

This place is 1st rate. I know nothing about batteries yet, they're indispensable for some artifacts to work. 1st time I went in store there was a grumpy middle aged (I'm no spring chicken either)guy that didn't seem happy to see me & was not interested in helping either. I shop local & as with people, I give businesses more than 1 chance. Since that day, I have shopped there 3 times. On one of those times, I returned an item. A young man, Josh, went above & beyond. He made the exchange process simple. The next 2 times I went in, Josh not only sold me what I needed, he also showed me how to insert it properly.helped me again. In addition to that, when I got home after last purchase (an awesome pencil like lithium flaslight), I had a question & Josh answered it & didn't seem annoyed by my call. Although I know nothing about batteries, they seem to have plenty of choices, the place is clean & they have convenient hours.< /review>

<text>One of the most helpful places I've ever been! The customer service and help I've received from these guys has been absolutely fantastic. I can't recommend it enough, if you have a problem with anything electronic they'll figure out a solution and either fix it right on the spot, or order whatever it is you need. You don't get pushed out the door like most places if they can't immediately sell you something.</text><Gmap_id>0x8085975b7f8fb665:0x4b5e7e03e2bf2c14< /Gmap_id>< pics>

<Review>Very easy shopping experience, good quality products.

My 36 month car battery actually lasted 3 years!  A first for my minivan.

Also Batteries Plus has a great selection of LED lighting and other batteries.</Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

They have all sorts of batteries and equipment related to batteries on hand. I needed some highly specialized batteries and to my surprise, they had them in stock! Worth a look if you need batteries!</text>

<Text>I’m on vacation in Kentfield and my phone screen wasn’t working so I dropped it off at bulbs and batteries yesterday and they said they would have it fixed by the end of the day. I gave them my password so they could make sure it worked after they fixed it and the tech guy texted us saying it worked and that we could come pick it up. When we got there all the tech people were gone and we paid 230 dollars and left. I tried turning my phone on and I could see the screen but I couldn’t tap anything. So we went back and since all the tech people were gone, they told us to wait until the morning to come pick it up. Keep in ind that we’re on vacation here and leaving for Lake Tahoe the next day. So the next morning they texted us and said that even thought the tech guy was supposed to be there at 8am, he didn’t come in until 1:30, and he can’t fix the phone at all, but we can’t take it because it has their screen on there. We’re currently driving to Lake Tahoe while he takes off his screen and puts the old broken one back on and we’re planning on mailing it back to our home in San Diego. Now I’m spending 5 days in Lake Tahoe with a 10 hour car ride back home without a phone and no pictures. I’m not pointing fingers at whose fault it is, but I’m definitely not going there again.< /Text>< pics>

Very good selection of LED bulbs  Rechargeable batteries and chargers.  I also take advantage of the quick iphone repair techs.  Service was super fast for camera replacement, price much more reasonable than Apple store.<//Review>

Waste of time and money.  I had a cracked screen replaced on my cell phone.  The touch screen did not work properly after the repair.  I went back the next day, and they replaced it again.  Again, it did not work properly, making the phone essentially unusable.  The store seemed unable to help me at that point. and I had to go to an Apple authorized repair center, who told me that the screen was sub-par and not installed well.</text>

<Review>Excellent service. I pre-ordered a case of one large battery and a single large of another type and brought in two cases of dead batteries. I was in and out in minutes!

In the past they did a huge fix on my son't I-Phone, it was so bad that when they were done it was like a brand new phone, new battery, new mike, new charger input. It was not expensive.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Review>This place reminds me of the good old days - the people working here really know their stuff.  They rebuilt my electric lawnmower battery two years ago and it performs like it never did before.  I always get my car batteries from them also - they have the absolute best service!  Love their free battery testing service (and no, they don't always say you need a new battery) and free installation.<//Review><Gmap_id>0x8085975b7f8fb665:0x4b5e7e03e2bf2c14< /Gmap_id>< Date>

This place is my go- to for all my battery needs. A  few months ago, I purchased a car battery there; and Jeff, one of the employees, quickly installed it, and even re-set the anti-theft car radio. Recently, (due to my fault of leaving lights on in the car,) the battery died, and after re-charging it, the code to re-set the radio/clock,etc was not working. I took it to Batteries Plus, and Jeff was able to figure out the correct code, and fixed it in a jiffy! What a helpful place, and great staff! Thanks Jeff, you deserve a raise!</Text>

<Review>The people here were great. I was looking for a hard to match car battery and to my surprise they had something. And for hundreds less then the dealer wanted. Plus with a much better warranty. They even had tools I could borrow and helped me get the battery out. And the sales guy was very knowledgeable about batteries and happy to share that knowledge.<//Review><date>1489460855338<//date><gmap_id>0x8085975b7f8fb665:0x4b5e7e03e2bf2c14</gmap_id>< UserId.>

<Text>I went into Batteries & Bulbs today with a clock that I loved that wasn't properly designed in that the battery required was too small for the allotted space and contact points.  Jeff found a spare plastic slip and rigged up an ingenious set-up so the battery was held into proper position and the clock face worked!

Thank you, Jeff - he wouldn't let me pay for his ingenuity and kindness.

I went in and they were helpful replacing a battery for a cell phone.  It needed to be warrantied and they said that the new one would be ready the next day at 1 pm.  I called at 1 and they said it wasn't going to be ready until 4.  I wish that they could have told me the correct time in the first case.<//review>

<text>Quick, good, and easy.  I quickly found the car battery I needed online, received good service from guys at the store (installing it into my car), and they made it easy for me.  I also learned a bit, as they do know their stuff (in addition to what I know from my electrical engineering career).</text>< rate>

I bought a battery online for my BMW. When I got there, they had it ready and all the clerk did is ask my name and handed it to me.

Easy peasy.

I brought my core back the next day and it was super fast to get my 20.00 credit.

I'll goto these guys everytime.</Review>

<review>Drove for 30 minutes to get to store at 5:45 to purchase battery. Website says 6:00 pm closed as does the sign on door. Person inside says we close at 5:45 on Wednesdays. One hour round trip drive for nothing

Just let us know batteries plus<//review>< user_id>

I went in to have my camera and screen replaced. I got home and started to use my phone again and to my disbelief neither feature worked! I called them immediately and an employee told me to come in Saturday to have it replaced. I drove out of my way an hour and a half to be told a technician was not available today and the first employee was extremely rude. So please learn from my lesson::

1. Always check their work before you exit the store
2. Technicians are not in on weekends no matter who tells you what.

I suggest going to a different store and save yourself the trouble.</Text>

I was replacing the battery in my Nexus 6P and came across a stuck screw. I walked in and within 5 minutes they had the screw out and gave me the screwdriver to complete my repair as well at no charge! These guys really care about the community</Review>

<Review>Sinister Diesel does an excellent job at both providing extremely high quality diesel parts and ensuring customer service is their top priority. Their service team is incredibly fast to respond to questions/concerns. When you buy from this company you can rest assured that you are going to receive high quality parts while supporting American business, and I will be a returning customer without question.< /Review>< username>

<text>Awesome products! I purchased a coolant filtration kit for a 2003 f350 6.0 and a bunch of random stuff to go with it. I was amazed at the stuff that filter collected. The product packaging was very impressive as well. Will definitely be buying more goodies in the future!!< /text>< Rate>

Sinister Diesel is the place for do it yourselfers. I have ordered most of my parts from them and have always had a pleasurable experience. In fact I plan to order much more in the future. They always have their "Sinister Diesel" brand parts on sale which is a nice touch and the parts come in a timely manner. I would recommend sinister diesel to any one who wants to do it themselves and save on quality parts.< /review>

Had a few issues and contacted the customer service dept. They were amazing and extremely helpful and professional. Still waiting on my charge pipes but that's fine because they are hand made and quality is worth the wait. Would definitely recommend them to anybody.</Review>< Rating>

<Review>Very easy ordering process, very well designed website and a good selection of aftermarket parts. The only issue I had is the exhaust I ordered is a month and a half out on backorder. You know the availability is not the fault of sinister Diesel, however, never during the order process did it warn me there was a back order nor are there any statuses about availability with any products. Would have been good to know in advance if what I was ordering was actually there. The other half of my order was set to ship 5 days ago but I have not received a tracking number or confirmation of shipment.<//Review>< pics>

<review>I took my truck into the Ford dealership to get my truck looked at. I was told it would cost me $5,000+ for them to do injectors and pump on my truck. Sinister Diesel had a deal on injectors and a pump. All the parts I received are packed excellent and of high quality. They saved me a lot of money in parts doing it myself. I placed an order and paid for the return postage for the core on the injectors when I placed my order. I didn’t notice at the time but the system charged me postage for each injector. I placed the order on a Friday night and Monday morning I received a phone call from Sinister Diesel explaining the problem and letting me know that the money for the extra postage would be returned to my card right away. They easily could not have done anything and waited to see if I would call and say something. That to me shows that they care about the customer and will take care of them. I will go with them anytime I can and would recommend them to everyone!</review></record>

They sold me BD injectors which 1 failed within 7000 miles. The advertisement did not state they were remanufactured. When I asked for my money back they told me I should have known they were remanufactured. Becareful what you buy. Their listings are disingenuous.</Review>

Unfortunately the purchase experience wasn’t great. I placed my order and received a confirmation email, that’s great, however after one week... then 2 weeks absolutely no communication on my order. I sent several emails asking when it may ship or what the status was.... nothing. No response and no communication. Going on a month now and I still have no clue when my order will ship?? Or what’s even going on..... I don’t mind waiting for the parts to be built but for god sakes at least communicate or reply to me... hopefully I’ll eventually  get my parts. One day...</text>

Quality parts and the shipping is fairly quick!  I would recommend them for all your diesel needs. I have ordered thousands of dollars worth of parts and have not been disappointed in the quality of the parts and service.< /text>

Love the blue color and the wide selection of tailored products.  Haven't installed my cone filter yet but it arrived quickly enough and I did get shipping and order confirmation emails.  Timing was a bit slow bit nothing major.  Looking forward to getting the parts in...but I have to get my Excursion back from the mechanic first 🤣<//Review>

The price is awesome and the overall look is pretty cool blue spring kit for anyone wanting a little more out of your 6.0 powerstroke I would highly recommend these to excellent up grades from the guys at Sinister diesel.  Well priced, high quality materials, professional work, simple to install, that screams BLUE <3.</text><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x809b205f23721ddd:0x59a0dc394f26cda8<//gmap_id><user_name>skinny legend</user_name></record>

I bought a coolant/oil filtration system for my 6.0 powerstroke and the fit and finish was outstanding. The directions were some of the best I've ever used with very clear color pictures on the thick paper so if oil or coolant got on them you could just wipe it off. The only issue I had was that quite a few items were missing from the kit, all the hose clamps, 2 bolts for the filter housing block and a hose retaining clamp. Luckily I have a shop and had all these things anyway but just make sure to check before you install this!<//Review>

Bought two fuel caps for my new truck. Really liked the looks of the Sinister ones. Shipping and communication was great especially since everything is going a little unpredictable with Covid. Once I unboxed one of them and put it on I was very satisfied. Hopefully they make a DEF replacement for the 2020 Rams soon, will definitely purchase that as well.</Review>

This website is awesome. Professionally built, product is easily labeled. They have search bar tool to search by brand of vehicle or by category of part and it works flawlessly. Always have great selection of a variety of product to choose from. If you need to contact Sinister Diesel their sales staff is very knowledgeable, respectful & professional. I've made several purchases from Sinister because of their accessibility, professionalism & all around great pricing.<//text>

Ordered a cold air intake for a 2019 F350 6.7 and fits perfectly. Beautiful color on the piping. After I received my cold air intake and installed then I received an e-mail saying if you ordered a cold air intake you get a cleaning kit for free. I called the customer service and they were willing to send me one for free since it was the very next week after I ordered mine. . Highly recommend. . I know I will spend a lot of money with them</Review>

Was on the fence about buying a bypass oil kit, but with 10% off the other weekend, I decided to pull the trigger. Sinister products might get a bad rap based on the past (never on quality), but I’ve had nothing but good experiences with them. The bypass oil and coolant filter kit is of excellent quality and a very clean setup. The blue aluminum looks great and the mount keeps everything clean.<//text>

<Text>Finding the products I wanted was very easy, but the time elapsed between the date ordered and the date shipped was longer than than expected. I later found that one of the items ordered was still going through manufacturing, and that was all okay. The only problem was that I wasn’t informed so until I called to figure out what was going on with the other part of my order. It would’ve been nice to get a heads up before I started wondering if the delivery guy ended up with my parts.<//Text>< Rate>

Also, tried to up sell to another product, without providing any relief that the product I just bought is now illegal. Will not be in business long.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x809b205f23721ddd:0x59a0dc394f26cda8<//GmapID></record>

Customer Service wasn’t the best in sending me the right bracket. It took me over a week for them to approve it to send the new bracket. I called several times and they kept saying the representative that’s working on that is out but I’ll call you tomorrow when I find something out. Never got a call and had to call back. They finally shipped the new bracket and expedited it so I’m happy about that. But I just thought it could have been done quicker. I never got an email back from my first message about getting a new bracket sent to me.<//Text><Rate>3< /Rate><UserId.>104711824972211679658</UserId.><Time>1592913364109< /Time>< username>

Outstanding service and quality! I ordered an injector driver module for my 7.3, it came with extremely detailed instructions as well as a form telling you how to test your electronics/harness for faults before installing so you don't risk damaging your new product! Did the testing and installed and she runs like a dream! Will only shop Sinister Diesel for all of my diesel needs!</review>

This was my third order from Sinister. This purchase was for a 5" Turbo back exhaust system for my 2006 Ram 2500. Perfect fit and finish. System doesn't have instructions but if you can't figure it out you probably shouldn't be working on your truck in the first place. Shipping and customer service has always been first rate from Sinister.</Review>

Ordered the cold air intake for my 2018 F-250 6.7L Turbo Diesel. It was delivered in just a few days, installed in under 30 mins, and it looks and performs great! Gives my truck a nice deeper sound and you can really hear the turbo whistling during acceleration and decelerations. Great product and service!</review>

<Text>By far the best customer service, also fastest shipping in hard times with covid going on. Definitely would recommend this company for any diesel supporters. I have a 07 powerstroke and will definitely be buying all my parts from sinister, also have a 99 5.4 f250 that will be getting an upgrade to a 7.3 so more parts will be purchased for that as well.</Text><gmapID>0x809b205f23721ddd:0x59a0dc394f26cda8< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I ordered an exhaust system from Sinister Diesel, I got an order confirmation e-mail from them right away. I heard nothing further for a week, I was expecting to get a shipping confirmation e-mail within seven days. It was an in stock item, their site mentioned nothing about back order. So I called them, they told me that they sent me an email saying that my exhaust would ship in one or two weeks. I never got that e-mail, but I was fine with a week or two. I heard nothing for three weeks, so I called again. Then they said the soonest it could ship would be in another three to five weeks. I just wanted to buy what seemed to be a high quality exhaust system. I wanted to give them my money for a product, they ended up keeping my money for three weeks and I got no exhaust. I just wish they had been honest from the beginning, honesty goes a long way. They wasted my time.</text>

The quality and the details in this product are extremely impressive, I ordered 4“ to 6” chrome exhaust tips and they blew me away on the craftsmanship and there definitely not made cheaply there strong and I believe they’ll be on the truck for a very long time, i would highly recommend sinister diesel to anyone<//Review>

I love the sinister diesel cold air intake that I bought.  But when I chatted online with tech which was helpful come to find out that it is an oiled air filter.  The oiled air filter is fine but I spent $399 on the intake which comes with the filter but after spending that much for for that setup one would think that they would give you the oil for the air filter.</text>

<review>Ordered parts for a 2009 Cummins through sinister just a couple weeks ago. After having parts from a competitor on another diesel truck we own, I wanted to try some of theirs. Difference in quality isn't even close. Very high quality, well made parts. Shipped the day after I ordered and arrived at my door in 5 days. I will be using Sinister again in the future.<//review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

Great experience, website is easy to understand and well organized. I received my shipping info quickly and received my parts earlier then expected. Would definitely purchase from them again. Parts arrived as promised and function perfectly. I purchased the 6.0 EGR delete kit and oil cooler replacement.<//Text>

<text>Great service, from the parts to the time they get to you in. I had worked with a few other diesel part dealers, wasn’t real impressed, but Sinister diesel was definitely different I was all around very pleased. Prices to shipping to returns, well rounded. Had to return a gasket kit, wanted to keep the head studs, they were more than happy to help!</text>< pics>

<Text>I was very impressed with how fast the shipping was and the customer service I had. I took advantage of their blue Friday (Black Friday) deals and was a huge discount.  Haven’t been able to install all my products yet but everything that was described is what I received.

What I was looking for was easy to find and the info spot on. Shipping was fast and on time even thought two items shipped differently, not sure why. Parts fit perfect and instructions where included, and I plan on buying more from them.<//review>

Does not change the sound much, but it’s also just a DPF back exhaust. Piece that connects to the DPF has to be cut according to your truck model.< /Review>< response>

<text>Quality parts, and great customer service. I purchased an oil bypass kit for my 6.0 about 2 years ago. I ended up blowing one of the lines to my oil fill cap and called that day to see if they could get me a new one. They stand behind their parts and overnighted me two lines instead of just the one that blew. That kind of customer service is not often found anymore and I can attest to that. I do not shop anywhere else for my diesel needs.</text>< pictures>

I have a 2016 GMC Denali HD. I ordered the CAT fuel filter replacement kit. The screws did not have clearance from the engine to install the kit. I called the tech support and was just told that they’ve never heard of the screws not working. The follow up email was somewhat insulting saying there are two sets of screws. Use the one that works. Not impressed with their customer service at all.< /review>

I just received the CAC hoses I ordered and they are far better quality that stock. I have several other products from them and am very satisfied the quality. I wish I didn't live in California so that I could order some of their parts.</text>

I appreciate the prompt delivery and completion of my order. I needed the specific piece right then and there. But I find it hard to believe that shipping costs 30-40$ on a 9$ part that you could fit in an envelope. The majority of the box was packaging material. I didnt even get a sticker in there...</review>

Had been on other sites trying to get a grille for my hubby F350 super duty truck for a Christmas present they were either too big or too tall. Sinister had me to send a picture of the number inside the door, they told me I needed a modified grille, I ordered it and it fit perfectly. It arrived in time for Christmas and my hubby is happy as can be. Thanks guys you made his Christmas special.<//review>

<rate>5<//rate><text>Ordered sinister diesel 4” turbo back exhaust for my 2001 Ford F-250 7.3L! Package showed up 2 days after ordering before scheduled time! All parts where packaged nice and neat and in great shape! System installed in about 2 hour with no modification to anything all hanger fit into place as if factory! Started truck up and WOW! What a difference in sound. No need for straight pipe that comes with kit! Muffler has a nice low rumble at idle then wakes right up when you put your foot into it! Plus the really nice part not so loud it rattle your ear drums while cruising down freeway at 80 mph! All in all great experience with SINISTER DIESEL! Will be using them again and again got more items in shopping cart now it’s just trying to get wife onboard to spend the money bahahahahaha!<//text>< resp>

<text>I have a very blue 6.0 Excursion thanks to Sinister Diesel! I have been impressed by all the parts I have. My latest purchase is a Bulldog Series 2 Turbo. I definitely feel a difference in my mid range power! It would have been nice to have some directions, but the install was straight forward enough.< /text>< Pictures>

Excellent pricing, great products, easy to navigate site and fairly quick shipping given the current circumstances we are living in right now. When you need your truck to be on point with looks and functionality there's only one place I look to and thats sinisterdiesel.com. The only downfall I see is that there seems to be less choices for custom sinster diesel parts for LB7 Dmax< /text>

These Guy's are awesome to deal with , which includes Great Customer service , Fast shipping , and their parts are unbeatable in my opinion ,along with competitive if not the Best prices on the market . I'm not putting down Bullet proof Diesel products , but I think that those guys are over priced .That is why I give Sinister Diesel a 5 star rating , as I am a very satisfied customer . The only thing that I wish , is that they would send the buyer some Decals ( Sinister Diesel ) with your order , that's my only disappointment , ( I like Decals ) that show , and advertise who and what I am putting in my Truck . I would recommend these guys to an enemy , and that's saying ALOT . Thank You guys for your service and your performance parts that you offer . Sincerely Mr. Pat Paterson           Satisfied Customer and will be buying all of my parts from them .             A-1 in my BOOK .<//Text>

Ordered a borgeson high flow power steering pump for my 2001 ram 2500.
Shipping was slow, but I do believe it has to do with the virus.
Best price on the internet.
Thanks fellas.</text>

These guys are great. My orders always come in a couple days, and they are always quick to help. They respond to my e-mail questions at all hours of the night. Great service and prices, and some pretty cool parts they make themselves. I will definitely be getting more gear from them!< /Text>

I ordered an intercooler pipe for my 6.0 powerstroke and the original eta was 2 weeks out. I emailed them and told them I had to stay under 10 psi boost and they shipped it quicker because I needed it desperately.</Text>

Called after I placed an order to have the finish changed on a part I ordered. They were upfront about possible time delays due to the change and corrected the order right then and there for me. Item shipped out 2 days later and had no issues.< /text>

Bought the oil filter by-pass and coolant filter kit for my 6.0 Excursion, showed up 2 days later, everything needed was right in the box down to all the little clamps and zip-ties, bracket, filter housings, filter caps, fittings and lines all fit PERFECTLY, no trimming or “adjustments” needed, just ordered a 4” Stainless Steel turbo back exhaust system kit, will be a lifelong Sinister Diesel customer!</text>

<Text>Every product i’ve got from sinister has been exact fit as oem, just as durable, and has far outlasted any of the other “just as oem” products. My orders have always been processed and shipped, even through the covid-19 pandemic, in a very timely manner. I’ve always had great responses with great help when asking questions about the product or simply what i need. Great company with great products, that will continue to have my business for the years to come.< /Text>< Response>

Will not be ordering from Sinister again. Shipping time was slow, shipping price was ridiculously high, . Don't know if part will be good, had to buy one locally so I would have something to drive. Truck was down waiting for the part I ordered from Sinister.< /Text>

I ordered my parts online and at no time did it say one of my parts was on backorder. My mechanic already had my truck apart and they would not send the part overnight. So I had to wait through a long holiday weekend to get my part. Also in talking with customer service the guy was very rude<//Review>

<Text>Great company. From the user friendly website, high quality parts, constant offers, and points system for account holders. One of the best ways you know attention to detail is a must every box is labeled with who assembled and inspected the product. You can’t go wrong with Sinister Diesel.</Text></record></dataset><record>

I ordered an exhaust system from Sinister Diesel two weeks ago it was my first time ordering from them. After ordering I seen I had an issue so I thought, so I emailed them I got a quick response from them I was amazed at the customer service that I received. I was so impressed that within the same week I actually placed my second order with them a cold intake, I was gonna order it from somewhere else but because of the customer service I received it made me order from SD. Yup, my hubby is lucky he gets Father’s Day and our wedding Anniversary all in the same week! I will definitely be ordering again! I definitely give them ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</review>

I got 2/3 thing I ordered and they work amazing I did not receive my blue spring kit yet but that’s due to a ups mess up but they are a little behind on my replacement but I’m not to upset I’m sure I’ll get it soon. But as the cts2 tuner and s and b air intake goes they work great definitely see a great improvement.</text>

Best quality EGR Cooler, Oil Cooler, and Coolant Filter kit. My truck runs like new and Sinister Diesel helped me get exactly what I needed. Top notch customer service and the highest quality parts available.

Will only shop at Sinister Diesel for my parts for now on.</Text>

It's been a pleasure doing business…
It's been a pleasure doing business with sinister, Julien at sales was knowledgeable and respectful. He was willing to work with me in a pinch, got the part to me in a hurry. The affirm payment option for a seperate purchase was great option and I'm quite happy to have made that deal. I cant wait to get my new alternator and cold air intake installed! Thank you sinister for being awesome!<//Text>

I had to replace Intercooler pipes, and I am by no means a mechanic. Sinister had great reviews so I ordered new pipes. They had videos to help me, not that it is a hard project but it helped. I had also called to ask questions about other upgrades, my experience was great from how quickly the parts shipped to the customer service over the phone to the quality and look. I will definitely continue to do business with sinister diesel.< /review>

< Review>
Just installed Sinister Diesel Coolant Filtration System on my 6.0 Powerstroke need too say love it. Knowing I have piece of mind that my coolant would clean not prevent any clog on the oil cooler. This is a must have. Planning on installing one on my 6.8V10.. Secondly would be purchasing a By Pass Oil Filtration double the oil filtration help trap small debris in the oil.<//Review>

<review>Ordered multiple parts from Sinister Diesel for my truck. Everything is always on time and their customer service is always helpful and willing to answer any and all questions, no matter how many. Never have to worry whether or not all the parts will be there when it arrives. Only downside is the pricing, some stuff seems a bit overpriced, like you’re paying for the name sometimes (especially on smaller items). As for the big stuff, the pricing is fair and the quality of the parts will never disappoint. I will be ordering from Sinister for as long as I have a diesel!</review>< Pics>

The parts I received for my 2004 Ford Excursion 4X4 6.0L were good quality parts and they shipped the order pretty quick! I’m not sure about dealing customer service on the phone I’ve never called them but I have emailed them one time and I received a quick reply within 24 hours. I’m a very happy customer and I would do business with them again!< /Review>

Bought the intercooler pipe kit with boots and intake elbow for 04 6.0 Powerstroke and couldn’t be more pleased. One of my CAC boots ripped only allowing me to build 14lbs of boost. After putting this kit on I am back up to 28-30lbs of boost and it looks awesome too! Also, I had to call customer service for an issue I was having and they were extremely knowledgeable and nice. I will definitely be buying more from them in the future! Thanks guys!< /Text>

Quality parts! Way better over OEM. Great customer service. Not to many places now will just answer some questions for you & go right to the back to confirm something is in stock. If I need anything else & Sinister offers it, I will be getting it from them.< /Text>

I recently purchased an EGR delete kit with the high flow elbow and a charge hard and cold side pipe kit. The quality of these products are outstanding. The instructions are super detailed and they provided great customer service. I will definitely shop here again!< /text>

< Review>
My  2004 Dodge Diesel Ram 5.9 Cummins theres a Hugh Different in air flow diameter  between the stock Elbow and Sinister Diesel's Elbow. The Inner cooler pipes by Sinister Diesel are much Bigger than the factory pipes. And definitely love the powder coating Blue ! The parts fit perfectly and didn't have much problem getting it together except for removing the grid heater gasket .<//Review>

Have A lot of blue Sinister under the hood of my 05 f250 6.0, just passed 241,xxx with stock heads/ studs and I can only think the preventative measures I’ve added to ensure a reliable, faster, and cooler looking motor have helped keep my 6.0 on the road and truckin! Thanks for the quality products!</review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>Awesome product! I ordered the blue spring upgrade for my 6.0 powerstroke. You can tell its a quality product from the moment you open the package and it looks great on the truck! It was very easy to install and came through with quality you can depend on. As soon as I started my truck I noticed the difference in idle quality and power. When driving I noticed the turbo spools quicker too. This product is a must have to protect your injectors with the higher fuel pressure.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

< Review>
Purchased injectors, a lift pump and a sump kit for my 01 dodge 2500. Everything came on time and showed up in good condition.  Didnt receive a tracking number for the injectors because they shipped straight from dynamite diesel. But sinister sent me tracking info with no issues. Will consider them in my future diesel parts purchases.<//Review>

I was very happy with the product it looked good and worked good. the only complaint I had was with the style of cover that came with the regulator was shaped differently from my stock cover and they should have an option for an extension on your fuel pressure sensor because of this I had to get an adapter at the local auto parts store but all in all everything turned out good.<//Text>< rating>

Have been installing these parts for some time as a mechanic. Now I own a diesel, I can reap the benefits. Sinister is well made, high quality and the extra money it costs is well worth keeping the USA in business.< /Review>

First time ordering stuff from them. My parts were on backorder. Well i was moving and needed to give them my business address to make sure id get them. Their customer was spot on and polite. I was actually mind blown how professional they were. After they emailed me to confirm they switched to the right address and i got them no issues. Their signature finish in the parts is actually mind blowing. Its sexy as hell.<//review>

I ordered the blue spring upgrade for my 6.0 powerstroke. You can tell its a quality product from the moment you open the package and it looks great on the truck! It was very easy to install and came through with quality you can depend on. As soon as I started my truck I noticed the difference in idle quality and power. When driving I noticed the turbo spools quicker too. This product is a must have to protect your injectors with the higher fuel pressure.</review>

Just installed the Sinister Diesel Coolant Filtration System on my 2003 Dodge 3500. Great package with everything I needed for the installation. Instructions, packaging and parts are all professionally done. Would highly recommend this product to anyone looking to run a coolant filtration system on their vehicle. I also ordered 2 extra filters so I can do the recommend initial filter changes for the system. Lastly, working with Sinister Diesel to get a bypass oil filter system for the 2003-04 5.9l dodge. They have helped me out and hopefully keep coming out with more products.< /Review>

I bought their exhaust system for my lbz. Good price, easy to install. Shipping was free and got a discount code so couldn't beat it. Only thing I can knock is the instructions were kinda lacking. Just a detailed pic of where each pipe and hanger goes would be nice. Luckily there are videos on YouTube installing this exhaust so not too hard to figure it out. Oh and you think they would include one sticker, but nah. Oh well.< /text>

<review>So far so good.  First time ordering and although the delivery was delayed,  they called me personally to let me know.   I appreciated the personal call vs an email or no notice at all like most companies.   Intake system  was well packaged and looks awesome.<//review><time>1544148488737</time>< Pictures>

I called to get information on parts I was wanting to order was told they were in stock and would ship out . 3 days later I called back because parts had not shipped I was told oh parts with people that do are powder coating it should ship Monday which is  5 days away. So they did upgrade me to second delivery. Now Wednesday still no email confirmation of order being shipped so I called back again. I was told this time  they did not have the part it was back ordered and would be at least a week or two before it shipped. At this point I asked for a full refund and was told the refund would be issued that day.  I called back 3 days later just to make sure refund had been done not seeing anything with the bank. I was told no the refund had not been done yet , I was then told they would issue refund that day again.  5 hrs later I get an email confirmation of refund and two days later today I finally have my refund.  I see sinister as a joke. If you don’t have the parts just say so up front don’t lie to your customers and play games.
I went to Banks ordered my parts no problems and had them two days ago .<//text></record></dataset><record>

Got 4” exhaust, and it sound fantastic. Would have given 5 star, But never got a tracking number, package just showed up. Otherwise great equipment, and really good shipping time. Just wish I could have tracked it.< /Review>

< Review>
Recently ordered new up pipes and a down pipe for my 6.4 powerstroke which is my main work truck. Had a short window to do the work and i give kudos to Sinister Diesel  for making it happen. Being a pipefitter/rig welder type person for over 30 yrs other people's work gets picked at pretty hard and i have to say it was beautiful work and couldn't ask for a better fit on the flanges. Great job y'all and Thank you<//Review>

I recently picked up a powerstroke. Sinister deseil has a lot of popularity in powerstroke searches. I started to look at their products yes prices are high but look at the quality. The welds are beautiful the material is top notch. That blue isn't to bad either lol. I decided to go with a blue spring upgrade with their billet housing. So during installation one of my threads stripped on my powerstroke. The housing is so well built  by sinister diesel it doesn't leak and or matter. I plan to get it fixed but its a oat to quality. However decide for yourself.< /Text>

Have ordered twice from Sinister. Products arrive in a reasonable amount of time and items were well packaged. I had an issue with a small piece out of my blue spring kit. Customer service took care of me without hassle and sent a replacement quickly. I think the products look great and I have had nothing but positive experience with customer service. Would recommend to friends.<//review>

Purchased the oil filtration for my Ford 6.0. I was adding it to my existing coolant filter and the new kit came with a bracket to accept both.
Kit is well made and was easy to install and looks great under the hood!</text>

Every time I need something for my 6.0 I always turn to Sinister first. I have almost every product available from turbo to caps and EVERY part is awesome. the craftsmanship is over the top. I see alot of people on pages bashing Sinister due to a bad experience and price. Well cheaper is usually never better and every manufacturer out there has bad apples. You pay for what you get and here you get quality!!!< /review>

Great fast customer service. I ordered an intake and a shirt. They forgot to send the shirt and that day they sent one out immediately with some free goodies inside. I don’t rate a company on their mistakes but I rate them on how they correct them. So I give them a 5star rating.</Text>

<Review>Poor online explanation of items added with your purchase, such as the ultra torque lube, they state "do you want to add ultra torque to your order for $9.99" i said yes, but when it showed up it was just a little 1oz tube not the 10oz bottle I expected like other performance part companies add, when you buy a arp head stud kit don't waist $9.99 for something that comes included already with every arp head stud kit.  What a rip off! Never going thru sinister again and stay away from the blue devil!  But hey they send ya another 1oz bottle. What a joke!<//Review><Rate>1<//Rate></record>

I have ordered several parts for my 7.3 excursion from sinister diesel and the quality of parts has been outstanding. Their customer service is excellent and they have helped me find the correct parts for my needs. I am for sure a sinister fan and nice to see there are still companies with quality products!!!<//Review>

I bought a Redhead steering gear for my 2008 Ram 2500 had it installed and love it. A little tight but expected it I know it will loosen in time. Sent the core back to Redhead, and hoping I get the core charge back as fast as they shipped it to me.< /text>

<Review>The parts I received were exactly what I ordered and delivered on time.  I would only ask that the instructions were a little more detailed in where certain hangers went on the exhaust system.  With that I will definitely buy from them again!!!<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

When another vendor who sells Sinisters parts, took my money and ran. I reached out to one of the sales reps Eric. Eric went well and beyond what customer service, he set bar. And had my parts out the next day. You've certainly  got a happy customer for life!! 🤘< /Text>

Ordered the 6.4 Powerstroke coolant filtration system. System components exceeded my expectations for quality. Unfortunately my Amp Reshearch retractable steps interfered with the filter. Called Sinister Diesel and ordered longer hoses and move the filter farther back from original mounting point. System works great and I will order more parts from Sinister Diesel.</Review>

Pretty easy to find what you need on the site. I had an issue with the heads up kit I ordered because the head studs that came with it were supposedly on back order. I called them to rectify it, took a couple phone tags but we got it done, and they quickly and efficiently got what I needed on the way and without any pain so cudoes to sinister diesel. Y’all are so doing a fine job!!!< /Review>

<Response>None< /Response><text>I purchased an exhaust system for my 2001 F350 crew cab long bed. The ad said it would fit any configuration truck up to 172 inch wheelbase and was a direct bolt in. For some reason the system is about 6 inch too short so I had to cut a chunk from the muffler delete pipe. only one of the hangars matched up with my Factory exhaust hanger points. The directions are mediocre-at-best telling you how to install it. For some who may have installed systems before it might be better. I was very disappointed that I still had to have professional work done to complete the system. I also think it would be nice if they would offer an exhaust system for trucks with a lift on it due to the fact that the piece that goes over the rear axle would not need to be bent at all. Quality of the product was decent for the price the welds did not look too bad but the clamps are pretty cheap. It's possible on the more expensive kits may be everything would have been better.< /text><Time>1573482485569< /Time>< GmapID>

I made the mistake of purchasing a different aftermarket adapter for my Duramax. The plan was to attach a CAT high efficiency fuel filter. Well, the adapter threads were wrong. So, I decided to order it from Sinister Diesel. When I received it, I compared it to the other adapter. Sinister Diesel has a great product! It’s large and very durable. It was very easy to install and looks great!! Thank you all for a great product!! His is my second purchase from you all. Both products are fantastic!!

Ordered the coolant filtration system and blue doing upgrade for my 6.0. Shipping took a little bit but it was worth the wait. Installed the spring upgrade and was simple! Looks great too. I have yet to install the coolant filter but will follow up with pics when I do.<//Review>

I ordered their 5 inch exhaust for my 2006 dodge 2500. Their price for a stainless exhaust is definitely hard to beat. My only issue so far is that the exhaust is back ordered for 6-8 weeks. I just hope the wait is worth it.< /review>

I have purchased the Blue Spring Kit & the Coolant Bypass System for my Ford. Ordering was easy. The coolant system arrived as promised, easy to understand directions. The Blue Spring became back ordered 10 days. I received an email informing me of the delay.

When I called customer service, Sean was very apologetic. He offered to help locate a shop that had it, if I needed before their delivery date.

The equipment was high quality machined & everything fit perfectly! The Blue Kit delivers the added fuel psi & the throttle response is great! The coolant system is also high quality parts & gives me the confidence that the Wix filter is keeping my engine free of contaminates.

I have friends who have purchased other items with great outcomes as well! Superb quality parts & great customer service equals a happy customer!<//Text>

I have purchased twice from Sinister Diesel. The staff doesnt just sell you parts they use their knowledge to guide you on how to build your vehicle up. They also have a great paying feature using Afirm. It allows convienant low monthly payments.<//Text>

They said it couldn't be done

Actually putting the Sinister oil bypass kit on a ram 6.7 with dual radiators it's pretty simple. All it took was putting a shim under the third bolt position and tipping the filter down far enough so that it didn't distort the hoses going to the radiator it works fine but it would be a lot better if they add two or three inches to the discharge line because I could have tipped it more and still had room to get the canister on from the bottom except I was starting to stretch the discharge line like a guitar string so I had to tip it back up thus somewhat distorting the radiator hoses.

I didn't really care what it was going to take to put the kit in ... it was going to go in because I don't really want to run soot though my bearings and as it turned out it was very simple to do .

So hopefully they'll figure out that all they have to do is lower the point of contact with the hoses and extend the discharge line to make it just as easy to put on a dual radiator system as a standard radiator system</review>

Products look well made.  Instructions/inventory didn't exactly match the   product I bought,  luckily I did my research and know what I need to do.  Communication was poor.  The product was on backorder and I didn't know until I called to check on why it hadnt shipped a week after the order was placed.< /Text>

I've only purchased an intake bridge pipe and a t shirt but extremely satisfied with fit and finish. Really dresses up under the hood looks great. T- shirt was nice too.</Review>

We were very happy that Sinister Diesel had a 4-6 inch drop pitman arm. Not many companies had this in stock. My husband builds custom trucks and Sinister will be our go-to from here on out. We would like to see faster shipping, but all in all very good quality and easy to use website!< /Review>

I've purchased the sinister coolant filtration system with oil filter bypass, blue spring kit with adjustable fuel pressure, billet fuel filter cap for running a fuel pressure guage, and a blue spring kit and thermostat housing for my brother. All for 6.0s. The quality of the parts and the speed at which we received them have been absolutely top notch. The fit is perfect, the finish is flawless, and the instructions that come with it are great. I will continue to use Sinister as I work my way through the bulletproofing process on my truck.< /text>

Sinister diesel service...I have been a diesel owner for years and ordered hundreds of parts from companies. I recently purchased the HSP Y bridge from sinister. There prices are great but there customer service is outstanding. I never waited to speak with a representative they were always polite, professional and knew about the product they sold. Best diesel company out there and will definitely use sinister in the future</text>

Sinister Diesel - My trusted source for everything for my truck!

What a great experience using Sinister Diesel. I need a new S&B air filter for my truck and not only was there website easy and fast to use but their pricing was very competitive. What a cool company. Shipping was 2 days early. Great Job!</text>

I ordered a fuel pressure regulator through sinister diesel. The product works great and really helped with the trucks performance. Delivery was fast and very well packaged with installer friendly instruction.</Review>

After installing 3 rebuilt alternators, best one lasted 5 months. I ordered a 200 amp from Sinister Diesel and was pleasantly surprised .  Quality product;  Great looks;  Solid 14 volt output.  Time will tell.<//text>

<text>Was looking for some parts for my 2000 f350 powerstroke and wanted something quick. Ordered up my parts and had them at my house in about 48 hours. Website was super easy to navigate and check out was a breeze. Made me not hate my life shopping online that day.

The best aftermarket company to deal with for all your Duramax & Powerstroke needs. Only saying these two because I own both platforms and have been using Sinister for a while now. They have me as a repeat customer for life. Friendly employees to deal with, reasonable prices and decent shipping.< /review>

Sinister Diesel is top shelf for sure. They even sent the exact star but to take off the electrical and the stainless nuts for the cold air intake. I emailed them and got a phone call in less than 5 minutes. Will continue to order from them as long as I own a diesel.<//review>

<review>I put the order in, I confirmed that everything was corrected when I caught it. They were on it and right back to me to confirm my concerns, with a dont worry we fixed it. The parts arrived in great condition. Haven't put them o  yet as my project is still in the build stage. I would suggest them to everyone I know, and that being said, they will be in business for a very long time.

Awesome products where form meets function. Why just work good when it can also look good? Will be making more orders in the near future.</Review>

Great parts. Blew a coolant line so decided to snag a egr delete kit and my truck can finally breathe. Just hope the law Doesn’t want to take a look cause the blue aftermarket parts might give me away< /Text>

Great product. I ordered the cold air intake for my 6.7 powerstroke. Really happy with the results and the way it fits. Quality parts, clamps, boots. However, reason for being a 4 and not a 5 is this, mine shipped about a week after I ordered it and when I received it, there were no instructions for installation anywhere. Luckily, I know what I’m doing a bit but there was nothing to reference at all. Other than that, I’m really happy with it.< /Review>

Shipping time was pretty fast for vehicle parts(4 business days). Parts were of great quality for my 6.4 work truck. Fixed a broken part, cost 5$ more than the OEM replacement piece and looks better too. The instruction needed a tiny bit more detail but anyone who is slightly mechanically inclined should be able to figure it out.</Text>

< review>
I have purchased a number of items from Sinister Diesel. The most major purchase I made was a complete solutions package for my 07 6.0 Powerstroke. To be honest, I was a little apprehensive to take this route rather than OEM, but in hindsight I couldn’t be any more pleased. All the parts were of great quality and they have held up great. About a year after replacing the head gaskets and other major parts included with the kit, I had a small problem with the o-ring seals on one standpipe. I contacted Sinister Diesel and their customer service took the care to replace the parts as quickly as they were able. The parts are great, the customer service is great, and the knowledge that these parts are made right in here the USA all help me to feel that I will go through Sinister Diesel for all of my truck’s needs. I couldn’t be any more pleased with the experiences I have had with them so far. They are a little more expensive compared to the knockoff items other companies offer, but in my opinion, it is well worth the extra money.</review>

<text>The sell great products at a fair price. I have bought items that are cheaper, from elsewhere. I can honestly say “You get what you pay for.” Sinister Diesel sells more expensive products but they fit like an OEM replacement. Will definitely be buying more from them in the future.<//text><gmap_id>0x809b205f23721ddd:0x59a0dc394f26cda8< /gmap_id><Name>David Thibadeau< /Name>< Pics>

I am very happy with their products. I’ve used their EGR deletes on my own truck and have had it on for over 2 years and never had any problems. And I’ve referred and installed them on 2 other friends trucks since then< /review>

<text>Sinister Diesel provided me with a LLY Race EGR full Delete. It was a quality product at a fair price. The instructions were very easy to follow too. They also included everything I needed for the job and what tools to use also before I tore into and found out I needed something special. The pipe had a slight fitment issue but was easily bent into place and tightened down. They also powder coated the piece Sinister blue so it didn’t only work good but looked good which I find equally important.

I would personally recommend my friends to buy Sinister products the four out of five stars was due to fitment and that it is hard to extremely please me.<//text><Time>1493754044403</Time>< user_id>

<Text>After hearing horror stories of cheaply made products my friends have purchased and ultimately regretted from eBay and Amazon, I decided to make sure that I buy quality products. I purchased the caterpillar fuel filter adapter from sinister diesel, and I am completely satisfied. The craftsmanship and quality maching of the product exceeded my expectations %100! I am pleased with my purchase and would definitely recommend. Thanks again guys.... A+++<//Text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

Do not use the web chat/email service.  They will not respond to that.  You will need to call, wait up to 10 minutes for a live helpful response to your questions.  If you need mike from the fab shop, wait another 10 minutes after the initial wait.  Have your cell phone fully charged.

All but one of my orders had fast delivery and quality parts.  Either made by sinister diesel or by others.

My only concern is of the weld integrity of their headers.  However, I was reassured after sending pictures and another phone call, that there have been no header cracking or other failures.  That these were full penetration welds and that they have a life time warranty.  We may find out more with this product.  I do not have that comfy feeling on the header quality.  The lack of fillet welds worries me.

Otherwise, no issues yet.  Thanks for the help guys</review>

<Date>1571788058815< /Date><Rate>4</Rate><review>I purchased a bypass oil filter kit for a 2018 Ram 2500 6.7 Cummins.  Parts seem to be very high quality and the kit installed fairly easily in a couple of hours.  The instructions came with color photos.  When they say “you may” have to move a coolant line to instal the oil line on top of the oil filter .... you do.  So I wouldn’t remove the NPT plug on top of the oil filter housing until all of that coolant drains out.  I also modified the factory bracket that they said needed to be removed for the upper radiator hose so that it could still be used.  All in all I’m impressed with the quality. I did an oil analysis before installation so time will tell in a year when I do another one what the results will be.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

I've ordered from these guys a few times, but it's been a few years since my last purchase. I came back to sinister because their customer service, prices, and response times were always good in the past. This time was no different, and I'll continue to use sinister in the future. The quality, fit, and finish are always excellent on their brand parts.< /Text>

Website is great and my parts arrived quickly as I anticipated.  The parts appear to be of high quality and the welds look great.   I ordered an EGR Cooler and an Oil Cooler for 6.0 Powerstroke.  I purchased a degas cap a while back and this is my second purchase.   So far so good.</Review>

<Time>1553144477438</Time><Review>The most outstanding performance parts on the market the S&D filter system for the 6.0 is better than they give it credit for, the shipping time and tracking was accurate and the customer service is excellent. If you want performance with high quality confidence in your dealer go SINISTER and you’ll never shop elsewhere!!!!!!!!< /Review><GmapID>0x809b205f23721ddd:0x59a0dc394f26cda8</GmapID>< user>

I have an 04 f250 with a 6.0. As expected I started having EGR issues after a few years. The only bulletproofing my truck has done is the head studs. Nothing else was done by the previous owner. So I got their kit for the egr delete, oil cooler update, and the coolant relocation. I haven’t installed them yet but they got here in good time, price seems fair for eliminating the issues this motor has.</review>

<text>I purchased a coolant filter kit for my 2005 f-350 and love it the kit looks good goes together easily and I have had no issues with it since installing took longer then expected to finally arrive but once here had it on in about 30 mins I will be looking for more parts from them in the future</text>< username>

I've purchased several products from Sinister.  On my last order there were some issues that required me to return some products.  Their customer service was outstanding.  They communicate very well in a professional manner and ensured my issue was resolved to my satisfaction.  I will definitely be back.</Review>

< Review>
Sinister Diesel has been a great resource for my F-250  parts.  The staff has always been very helpful with all my questions and any of my returns.

My only suggestion to them is to offer more items in a black or grey. I don't like to be flashy, so the blue is a little much for me.<//Review>

<text>I purchased the Sinister Diesel Blue Spring Kit with Billet Spring Housing for my  2007 Ford F 250 6.0  Powerstroke.
Quality product at a fair price. Installation was easy and didn't take long at all. This was my first Sinister Diesel purchase for Prohect Plain Jane.  I can guarantee you it won't be my last. Thanks Sinister for the great product and awesome customer service!</text>< response>

Bought an exhaust and it fit perfectly with no troubles. The only thing I could suggest is a diagram, if I didn’t know any better I could’ve very easily put it together wrong.< /Text>

Sinister Diesel’s IDM module was the fix for a ODB P1670 code on my 2002 Ford Excursion 7.3L (It was a shame to have to tuck this beauty inside where no one will see it). I don’t think you can beat the price or the quality of this product. They sent an excellent trouble-shooting guide to ensure that the problem is getting fixed and the core return was easy. I’ll be using Sinister Diesel for future fixes and upgrades!< /Text>

Purchased a 5" turbo back ss exhaust for my '05 Cummins. Price was excellent, plus 10% additional off for purchasing on weekend! Part was not in stock but sinister diesel worked with me. Great service! Will follow up when I get exhaust.< /text>

I talked to a parts specialist and they were able to answer all my questions and when they didn't have an answer they transferred me to someone that could could. Fast shipping and the quality of the up pipe and high flow intake pipe were really great quality, well worth the money, I will definitely be doing business again with Sinister Diesel< /review>

I went through 4 110 amp alternators on my 6.0 excursion in one year. Bought the sinister diesel 200 amp alternator and my truck runs better than ever. It was spendy but well worth it plus it matches my other sinister diesel accessories</Text>

<rating>5</rating><Review>I have ordered from Sinister twice. Both times, no problems. Both were web orders, and both shipped quickly (items delivered inside of a week, but I am in CA.). I've never dealt with anyone in person, or on the phone. Maybe they are jerks in person, but I would never know. They've had what I needed, so I'll continue to be a customer until there's a reason not to be.
Being in the retail business myself, I see a lot of these 1 star reviews among a sea 5 star reviews and there is always more to the story than the complainer let's on. Usually the customer is just a pain in the a$$ and will never be happy. Many times the customer is just flat out wrong, but the internet has given every whiner a voice, so there you go. Frequently it is actually the distributor or manufacturer that is the reason parts are delayed. No company is perfect, and sometimes problems occur. That doesn't mean a company is bad or dishonest. You'll just have to give them a shot and find out for yourself. I'm happy with them, if that makes any difference.<//Review>< pics>

I purchased a Fuel Filter Cap for my 6.0l Excursion.  Part came in Quick, it was well packaged, look and feel are excellent, and works perfectly.  I am really glad that I chose to go with this metal cap vs. getting another plastic cap.  Thanks for everything.</review>

The parts work great performance wise,definitely woke my 7.3 up, and very freindly customer service. The only complaints I have is that 1. they had to send my kit separatly parts because they didn’t have them in stock (I’m still waiting on an exhaust ) but they did contact me informing me they would have to do so. 2. Is that  it almost seems like they sent the wrong support for my air intake because it’s about 5 inches shorter than it would need to be to mount to the truck. So this left me having to make a support bracket for the part but after this it worked perfectly.<//Text>

<Text>I ordered an IDM from Sinister. It arrived promptly and looks really nice. I thought I had an issue with the IDM being the wrong one. I contacted Sinister and they went over every part of the order and I was assured it was correct. Installed the next day and worked perfectly like they assured me it would!!

Ordered for the first time from sinister. The parts I ordered were on back order, they informed me right away. They gave me the option to cancel order, or wait. I chose to wait. They contacted me as soon as the parts shipped and gave me an estimated arrival date. Will be ordering from them more often! Very responsive!< /Review>

I've spent a lot of time on the internet searching for the right place to buy diesel parts for my LBZ Duramax. I have compared prices, reviews, parts details, and shipping costs. The choice all came down to Sinister Diesel and I was not disappointed!! Great service, great products!! This is now my go-to diesel site....thanks Sinister!!<//Text>

I love you Sinister Diesel I've been using them for almost 10 years and their products are far more superior they've put a lot of effort into it especially if your own power strokes they are one of the best or use their parts on my personal trucks and on my work trucks I own a construction company and have a quite a few vehicles and they're blue which for me is awesome my favorite part about them is probably their customer service more in reference to the technical support side and troubleshooting they have no problem talking to you all day long if you need some help working on something I love Sinister Diesel.</Text>

When bulletproofing my 6.0 they had everything I needed and some great solution kits to offer. Shortly after buying a 6.7 they had a wide variety of parts to choose from. All in all a great company to do business with!< /review>

By far the best quality parts on the market. So far i have purchased the Blue Spring kit with Plate, EGR delete, Oil bypass kit, Sinister badging kit, and most recently purchase of the coolant filter kit. All the Sinister products are made to perfection and you can tell are over engineered for long term life and attention to detail in even the packaging of their products.

Every time i call i get a person i can talk to and a friendly voice, and was even offered a military discount once they found out i was a Marine.

GREAT JOB SINISTER TEAM!! Almost done with my Excursion and will be sending you guys pictures!!<//Review>

Great experience with Sinister Diesel!
I ordered a an AMSOIL By-Pass filter kit for my 2006 Dodge Ram 3500 5.9L Cummins. My oil is as clean as ever. Have not conducted an Oil Analysis yet but plan to soon. This kit is amazing and looks real good under the hood. Only point of concern I had was the vibration and what effects it will eventually have on the filter but, the bracket is welded with quality!
When I did initially received the order it did heave the wrong filter head. It had the coolant filter head instead. I called Sinister Diesel up told them the issue and they mailed the right filter head overnight!
Thank you Sinister diesel!</Review>

Sinister says it all from the quality and performance of their parts to the great customer service they have it all! 10/10Easy to install (even comes with an instruction book if 1st time doing it) parts always fit how they're supposed to and couldnt ask for more than what I had expected!< /text>

They had the part I needed for $15 cheaper than my Ford dealer could get it for. The part came quick and one YouTube video and an hour later the part was installed without a hitch. I think I saved myself about $300 installing the part myself.  I only wish I had the bucks to purchase some of the cool items for my truck.  I would recommend them to anyone.</Text>

<Text>Just picked up a 6.0. Sinister is the place to go for needed parts. Ordered a coolant filter kit, arrived in 2 days, everything was packaged cleanly and fit great. Will soon be ordering more.

<Review>2000 Dodge Ram 2500 Diesel, needed a new clutch master/slave cylinder. Sinister Diesel had the South Bend HD set up for a good price. Ordered it and received it no problems. Quick and fairly painless installation. Clutch pedal and shifting feels much better now.<//Review><rate>5< /rate><time>1493739227036< /time>< UserId.>

< Review>
I was very pleased with how easy it is to navigate on the website & I am very pleased with the parts that purchased from sinister diesel but...... I am very disappointed with the fact that I spent over $1000 & didn't even receive a sticker for my truck. $1000 dollars is worth a hat, t-shirt, and sticker in my opinion. How can you advertise for a company without any advertisements?< /Review>

Customer service kept me posted by email on its progress. Even sent me a complimentary t-shirt when I inquired about order.

Ordered a 4inch exhaust for my 2001 silverado duramax and received the items sooner then expected. System sounds great. When I am looking to order more items for the truck I will be ordering from sinister.</Review>

<Review>Just ordered from sinister for my f250. They Called me to ask some clarifying questions which I loved. They wanted to be sure they sent the right part. Absolutely loved the experience. I will definitely use them in the future with anything related to my truck. Thanks sinister</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

They have always fit and looked great. If I do have a problem the service department is on it. The one problem I had was the adjustable blue spring kit. It didn’t come preset to the pressure it was supposed to be set at. It was very high. I’m glad I had a gauge installed or I could have ruined my injectors. I called the service department and they guided me on how to adjust it properly.<//text></record></dataset><record>

I ordered an injection pump for my Duramax after mine went up. I ordered a pump they said they had in stock online and paid extra for overnight shipping. They not only didn’t notify me that the pump I ordered was not actually in stock, but also had the nerve to charge me the extra 55 dollars for a pump they did have in stock, 3 days after I was supposed to receive the first pump. They also stated that they would refund my initial shipping cost since I didn’t get a pump for about a week after the initial order, but that never happened. I also had to get a shipping label sent from them for the core return because they were going to make me pay shipping to send the core back! And I inquired about the shipping cost being refunded to me in the same email chain and have yet to here back from them after 5 days. I will never recommend them or buy from them again. Very disappointed in the customer service, system, and just general business practice. I’m convinced the only reason the pump wasn’t junk is because they didn’t make it!<//review>

<Review>I ordered my egr delete and air intake from sinister. The intake was back ordered so we emailed them and they instantly replied and told us when it would be shipped and arrival date. They produce great products and have good customer service. They also send free sinister stickers and sometimes shirts with orders which is nice.< /Review><user_name>Eric Odum</user_name>< Rating>

< Review>
Great company and great productsI have ordered through Sinister Diesel four times in the past and recently ordered a new air filter and charge pipe kit. I have not installed yet but the kit looks great. Can't wait to get it on. Great service, shipping was good, and customer service was excellent. Everything comes to my door quickly and everything arrived undamaged. Thank you, will be a repeat customer.

In the picture, there were packing peanuts in the box when the charge pipe kit was shipped. When they arrived I took them out.<//Review>

I have a notorious ford 6.0 and I've bought everything sinister to bulletproof my engine and I definitely made the right decision. Yes it's more pricey than other brands but you also get what you pay for. Best to do it right the first time!<//Text>

I had my mechanic install steering gear, pack up core and I shipped it back to Red Head. I received my core refund in two days and was extremely pleased with the ease of doing business with Sinister Diesel. I would certainly recommend them for anyone needing parts for their diesel truck..<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

I  searched the Web and found looking for some parts and found Sinister Diesel.  They had the type of locks I wanted for my truck hitches,  and for the best price.  Not only was their price the lowest, but in addition, Sinister provided me with a a $10 off coupon  as a first time purchaser!  The locks came quickly and they were packed well and in perfect shape.  I have already recommended Sinister to my friends and I will definitely order from Sinister again.  It was a very good experience.< /text>

I,have used Sinister Diesel on several different occasions to purchase parts to upgrade my 05 Powerstroke and i have been extremely happy with their service, parts have arrived quickly and without damage.  They have a wide selection of parts and kits to get the job done. And the one time that i did need to return some items it was hassle free.
I,would highly recommend Sinister Diesel, and i will continue to use them as i continue to  keep my truck on the road for many years to come.< /Text>

Despite having delays with two orders, I stand
By 5 stars for SD and Aaron in ordering.  I received a wrong alternator, but Aaron researched it and got me the correct part.  Second issue was with the SD motor mounts for the duramax.  The mounts arrived timely but two fastening nuts for the mount bushings were missing.  Again, I turned to Aaron and the missing parts were over nighted so that the project could be completed.

Thx SD!!</text>

Not to mention they ise fear tactics and lies to attempt to bully anyone they see as a threat.

I wouldn’t recommend doing business with this sorry excuse of a company.< /text></record>

This is a great place to shop! They have everything that you need for any truck! I have a Duramax and I love their customer service and parts. They even have a way to set up email preferences to let you know about parts for your specific truck! What else could you ask for from a company?? I have had nothing but good experiences from them! 5 stars!</Text>

I ordered the coolant filter and secondary oil filter kit from sinister. I couldn't be happier. Easy install and when I called with questions they were there to help. I have already recommend them to many other diesel owners who have also ordered from them. I will be back for future business for sure.< /review>

Found my part I needed on the website and ordered it. It showed up a few days later. The steering damper for my Ram 2500 was a good fit and easy install. Can't vouch for the customer service as others are complaining about because they got my order right and I didn't need to call them. That alone says I'll come back again.</Review>< Pics>

<text>Very fast shipping, the stuff I ordered was built way better than I expected at a reasonable price. One of the t-shirts I ordered was out of stock in my size so they threw in some cool stuff and an extra shirt for my wife,,and an actual hand written note which you don't get now days. Great company, great people!!

<Text>We've used sinister for my wife's Ford 6.0 power stroke, the sales reps have always been very helpful and have gone way beyond to make sure we have the right parts fast and at a great price.  There office staff is great also, we've dropped in to the office with our three boys, ages 8-10 and they are always giving them something cool, top notch customer service and we are very happy with the quality.</Text>< time>

<review>Worst first experience ever!! Bought a $650 hpop (reman) which turned to be defective. Company warrantied the part but I got stuck paying an additional $850 because their warranty didn't cover any labor. Turned me off completely when I had heard so much good about this company.  Won't use again.< /review><pics>None</pics><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x809b205f23721ddd:0x59a0dc394f26cda8< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Great company, to deal wit. I have purchased a few items from them. They have good quality parts, and they look great too!  They also stand behind their parts.  Would definitely recommend them to others.</Review>

Bought some parts for my 97 f350 from these guys. Not only was the shipping fast and the parts worked exactly as they were listed to, but the technical support was over the top. Had a problem installing a harness and one of the techs walked me through the install step by step. Would recommend Sinister to anyone!</text>

<review>Ordered a part that did not work as described and was incomplete to allow for normal operation of the vehicle after install. Even after chatting with two "technical advisers" before ordering to ensure the part wouldn't cause a CEL it was obvious these two had no idea what they were talking about despite their assurances to me. Took them a month to respond to numerous calls and emails about the issue and even now more than FIVE WEEKS after the original email they still haven't answered the question as to whether or not I can return it. Garbage product, garbage customer service. Do yourself a favor and order elsewhere, this company is useless from start to finish.< /review>< rate>

I have a 2006 f250 super duty.  when I got ready to purchase a cold air intake for my truck, I looked around at different brands.  when it was all said and done, sinister was my favorite. I got one, and I'm very happy.  the tech support is great.  I plan on buying their stage 2 turbo soon.  great products.<//Review>

<review>I bought Sinister Diesels coolant filter kit. It installed correctly for my 2004 Ford F250 6.0. I've had it for approximately one month now and am about to change the first filter. Hopefully it's doing its job, I expect to see quite a bit of debris unfortunately. I'll try and repost, or update my post after my findings!<//review>< Pics>

So many fake reviews.... They went from 1 Star to 5 stars in a week. 99% of the reviewers have 1 review. They’re trying to save themselves after social media blew them up over the color blue....</Text>

< Review>
I ordered an EGR delete kit for my 2006 Duramax and could not be happier with the install.  The kit came with everything I needed for the install.  The quality of the part is second to none, love the color and the sinister decal on the piping, it adds to the look of the engine bay.  I am 100% satisfied with the customer service I received from Sinister Diesel, receiving email notifications when the part shipped as well as emails asking if I received everything I ordered on-time and undamaged.  Great Company to deal with, will order again from Sinister Diesel.< /Review>

<Text>Bought a 2003 f250 Superduty and my mechanic purchased everything I would need from sinister diesel to fully bullet proof my 6.0. It's been about two years now and havnt had any issues what's so ever. Ordered some sinister diesel apparel for a couple of christmas gifts this year. Had a little trouble with my order when it arrived. Emailed them that day and got a response that very day. Costumer service was great. Thank you. Looking forward to doing business with sinister diesel again.</Text>< pictures>

Very fast and very affordable. Sinister had exactly what I needed for replacing the head gaskets on my 05 LLY. The kit with the ARP head studs was the best-priced one around and I saved literally hundreds of dollars. Fantastic company and I will continue to do business with them.</text>

I've been trying to get ahold of someone for over a week to order a $5,000 BD transmission and torque converter. I don't know why I keep trying with this company. Today the receptionist told me that if I desire faster service, call someone else. Will do, thank you for the advice!<//text>

Their customer service is going down hill fast!!!!    I don't appreciate being hung up on.   Throw an attitude at me and I'll send one back your way.  Last 2 times I have called I have been rushed on the phone and this last time I was just hung up on for no reason other than she was in a hurry to get off the phone.< /Text>

<Review>Order a $1000.00 Hpop and they don't send the Hpop cover gasket?  WOW.  I also tried to order an exhaust that I was told on the phone would ship in a day or two only to get an email 3 days later that it was back ordered for 8 to 10 weeks.  Spent a lot of money and wish I would have taken my money else where.  I would recommend using a local shop to order parts not these guys.  HORRIBLE if ask me....<//Review>< Pics>

It's fun talking to a person that knows what you are talking about instead of hearing the card file clicking in the phone to figure out what to say about what your asking............<//Review>

2007 F350 4X4 had installed 50hp boost on injectors and 100hp on FICM. I then was not breathing enough so installed SINISTER intake all pipes and a stainless racing exhaust 5" from turbo back. She runs like a banshee Indian on fire. My exhaust has muffler so much quieter than most (wife likes dat). I love all that blue under the hood. Told my wife I may take the hood off, LOL. It's lots of fun to drive.</Review>

<text>Bought my egr delete kit and sct tuner couple years back for my 2015 f250. Parts were shipped quickly. Egr delete kit had no instructions couldn't find any on the website had to install without. I do get a large amount of emails with suggested parts.. That are never the right part for my year model. But overall  happy with them.</text></record></dataset><record>

I had a major melt down with my12 year old 2005 6.0 Power Stroke Diesel Excursion. Oil Cooler ruptured internally and pumped 4 quarts of oil into my radiator. I went to the Web site for Sinister Diesel and did some initial research and then contacted Eric by Phone. He was most helpful and I ordered a package deal. It had an updated Oil Cooler, new design EGR Cooler, upgraded Stand Pipes, Dummy Plugs, HPOP update kit, upgraded Turbo Oil Feed Line, Drain Tube, Blue Spring kit, Bypass Oil filter kit, Bypass Coolant filter kit and all the necessary filters, gaskets and hardware to get the job done right the first time. I had looked elsewhere for most of this stuff, but the packaging and completeness of there kits are second to none and the price was right. I feel my 6.0 PSD should last me a long time now.< /Text>

< review>
Ordered a redesigned, Stainless steel EGR Cooler for my Duramax, web site and ordering process was all very straight forward and professional. Unfortunately for me Sinister is very professional and had to cancel my order because I live in California and their EGR Coolers are not yet CARB approved. The next day I confirmed that my money was refunded. In the end, I cant really complain about anything other than the Govt got in my way. I found a work around later on down the road so - I would recommend Sinister.</review>

<Response>None</Response><Review>Intake bridge on my GMC sierra works great. Sinister Diesel answered all my technical questions. They were addressed in a professional & user specific manner. My Duramax has been a complete nightmare  since new. Trying to get the OEM side to work was impossible with normal driving, that included long runs empty.(50 miles+)  Towing heavy loads is mandatory to keep the exhaust system open. Trying to manage intake air on a diesel engine is stupid and asking for operational problems. You can measure & record parameters on any engine, but trying do what the Auto Industry has tried do to on a diesel engine ridiculous.<//Review><Rate>5</Rate>< user_id>

Sinister Diesel was very helpful in making sure the right part was being delivered, they were very quick with fast shipping. I just wish they had more 7.3 parts.</Text>

My friend baught a 6.0 motor from there brand new and it was suppose to have coated Pistons high rev springs they gave him a motor that had been built a while ago that was just sitting there they didn't no for sure what was in it he said I think those r coated then upon installing the motor and every add on sinister has to offer the motor would not run wouldn't sink with ficom so I took it to the ford dealer they said wiring for so I baught all new harnesses under hood and changed them out still no fire so I called sinister again they said it was something my mechanic did so I took it to sinister mechanic he said that the cam crank timing was 7 teeth out  how do u buy a new motor that's assembled wrong so he said he would take care of it so I waited  another week and they said all the pushrods where bent and heads had bent valves too  I asked for a new motor I feel like this motor has bred abused already he responded all take care of it I owe u a credit of sum sort but I don't no till I get I get a remburst by machine shop what dose that mean
So the fixed heads and pushrods and gave it back saying all fix now enjoy soon as I started it it felt funny so I called my mechanic he put a snap on machine on it and it said a injector was bad but there brand new high performance 1 sinister sold me also they re flashed and lost my tune and said I need to purchase a new 1 I told him u lost it so he gave me a tunner next my performance fuel pump didn't work so they factory 1 back up and gave me a new hp 1 and said u hook it up also I got my truck back with masking tape holding the mass air meter on RIGGED finally I got it going and the fuel pump went out last night and had to get towed home only 50 miles on Motor and sinister parts this is the biggest waste of 20k ever 15 in parts and 5 k in labor so far so buyer be ware not strait up people< /Review>
