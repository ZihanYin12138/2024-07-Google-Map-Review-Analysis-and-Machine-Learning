< Review>
I was at the store today to add one more line and I samply asked for the price, but it was actually higher and asked the guy ( Nicholas R ) if there is anyway to make it lower and he was very rude and told to go for at&t or any other prepay carriers.
Is this how you guys guide your customer?
Seriously I never had problem with verizon but this guy made me to hate verizon.< /Review>

Provided everything we needed on provisioning a new Google Pixar 4a 5g bought from Best Buy -- but they (Best Buy) chose to not set it up.

Thanks to this authorized Verizon retailer being upstairs in Arden Fair shopping center, just a couple blocks away!

Will use these again if or when needed!< /Text>

Alex was friendly and easy going. He didn’t push me to make a decision or push me to buy the most expensive phone, but assisted me in making the correct purchase for my needs. He explained additional options and protection plans and phone cases to better protect my investment. He was sure to transfer all my data and photos as I requested. When I returned to pick up my phone and additional items, he asked his new customers to wait a short time to complete my purchase. Thank you Alex! Awesome job!<//Text>

I went to see Chris on 10/2.  Chris was as helpful as always with my new, replacement phone.  I met Chris over 2 years ago and whenever I have a phone question or problem he is always on top of things.  Good workers are hard to find.  Good customer service is hard to come by.  I highly recommend Chris because I cannot afford to be without my contacts or my photos!< /review>

I Purchase the iPhone X. The phone stopped working. Apple said it was a power issue. I decided to get my phone a more affordable route and figured no biggie since I was returning it within the first 14 days. The guy who helped me seemed but hurt and upset that I wasn’t willing to purchase a different phone. Business is business and I returned it within 14 days! Well he had the last laugh charging me almost $100 to return a phone that didn’t work in the first place! Oh well, at least I’m going to be saving money using a different method of upgrading. The nightmare doesn’t end, there are still charges on my bill for the phone that I returned. Now I have a headache on my hands.

This place is not honest so buyer beware. The other lady also charged me for liquid glass which I never asked for (on the phone that didn’t work so that’s even more money down the drain $54.99 to be exact). She acted as if it was a courtesy. I asked for a phone and a case originally, didn’t think she was charging me for something I didn’t ask for. Not to mention they charged me for several things that were not explained to me. These people are too worried about commission instead of giving honest service.< /Review>

Unfortunately my experience started great and ended terrible. I was upsold a tablet for $10 a month and told I had 14 days to return if I didn’t want it. Apparently the plan I went with didn’t qualify for the $10 a month plan so it was actually $20 so I did return it. When I returned it there is a restocking fee so I actually lost all my money and had to pay an additional $5 to return it... really unhappy with my experience to switch over from ATT.< /review>

<review>I went in 3 weeks ago and was helped by Rusty who thank goodness is no longer working there. He instead of upgrading my line for my tablet adds a new line of course for commission and his manager there Chris sees what happens and makes him reverse it.. when he rang me up, Rusty charged me a new user see up fee for $20 and he charged me for a screen protector that didn't even install so I've already been ripped off for  $74! A few days went by and I tried to call them up to tell them they overcharged me but of course their phone was down.  A few more days later I drove back up there and spoke to Chris and explained my frustration and that i shouldn't have been charged  $74. Chris immediately gave me $20 back in cash but the $54 couldn't be refunded for the screen protector so he said a check would be mailed out. 2 weeks go by no check. I call them and wow their phone actually works.  Chris the manager had a bit of an attitude on the phone and told me loudly that the checks been sent out. A week later nothing.. I think he said that to get me to shut up..i would never recommend this location to even my worst enemies.  Go to Costco instead..< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>{'time': 1496290530341, 'text': "Hello, John!

1 star just because I can't do 0. Save yourself some time and literally go to any other Verizon, half of these "good" reviews are fake, they offer you discounts if you give them a good review, they push you to buy phones you don't want and judge you for wanting a certain one.<//Text>

STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!!!!

The sales people here are lying, deceptive crooks who are ready to rob you of your money in order to make a nice commission for themselves. I came in about a month ago to switch from AT&T, since Verizon had just announced their unlimited plan that I was interested in.

First off, this place isn't even an official Verizon store. They are managed through A Wireless, who is a Verizon re-seller. They are very sneaky at not telling you this.

Rusty helped me throughout the visit, and at first he was great. We told me that I could switch over to Verizon for free and would get a new iPhone 7 if I traded in my old phone. It sounded too good to be true - and it ultimately was. Once I agreed to switch to Verizon and we were filing out paperwork, Rusty told me that the actual cost was going to be closer to $400 to activate the phone. I was really taken a back since he said the cost to activate would be free, but at that point it was too late to cancel. When we were finishing the transaction, Rusty tells me to choose what phone case I wanted. I told him that I didn't need one since I already had a case. He proceeds to tell me that the phone case is free and that it's included in the activation fee. We finished the transaction and I headed home with my new phone.

I got home and looked in my Verizon bag to take out my new phone case. Once I reach in, I realize that Rusty put in a car charger and a battery pack in the bag. "Wow, that was nice of him", I thought. I then decide to look at the receipt and that's when I found out the deception that I had just experienced. It turns out, Rusty charged me $40 for the phone case, $30 for the battery pack, and $30 for the car charger. These accessories, mind you, were the one's that Rusty told me were free. Rusty had also charged me other miscellaneous fee's that he had never told me about.

At this point, I decide to go to the actual Verizon store in Sacramento. The sales crew at the REAL Verizon store were in disbelief that I had been charged $400 for activating a new phone. They looked over the miscellaneous charges and told me that they had no idea what those charged were because the real Verizon doesn't charge those. They said that Verizon only charges the sale's tax for activating a phone, and that the price I should have paid should have been closer to $50. They told me to go back to Diamond wireless and demand a refund.

Knowing this, I went back to Diamond Wireless and wouldn't you know it, Rusty was there. The minute he saw me walking in, his face went white because he knew I had figured out all of the false charges. Rusty was not apologetic whatsoever and went on to tell me that those charges were correct and that they could not refund me. His coworker was especially bad and was laughing and smirking during this whole interaction. The coworker then proceeds to tell me that Diamond Wireless in going to take over Verizon soon, so I "better get used to it". Haha - immature and delusional!

I called Verizon customer service and told them what had happened, and they apologized for the actions and deceptions of Diamond Wireless. They said that Verizon does not endorse the charges that Diamond Wireless charged me for, and that they would refund me for the full amount of the charges. The customer service agent explained that they charged me so many false charges just so that they could get a higher commission. They kindly said that they were going to report Diamond Wireless for their fraudulent activity and thanked me for reporting it.

All in all, do not go to this place if you don't want to get lied to charged unnecessary charges. Do yourself a favor and go to the real Verizon store right down the street.</Text>

<Review>Stay away!  Lying clerks as this is not Verizon, but a franchise store.  Lied to me about not
Putting in an new SIM card and actually said that you couldn't buy a wifi hotspot without also buying a phone.   Verizon should pull these bastards franchise.  Beware the warnings from others who i should have listened to myself.<//Review><GmapID>0x809ada1e8ef9142f:0x1a0107bbd4128c58< /GmapID>< Rate>

Just left the store after waiting 30 minute's and never was even acknowledged. Not to mention either were the 3 customer's waiting before me. Very poor customer service and will not be returning to this store again.</Text>

This is my honest review of the place where I held my most special day 2/15/2020.

The start:
Things were great when we went on the walkthrough Rita showed us around she had a calm happy demeanor and we signed the contract.

They let us use their arch for our outdoor ceremony at no cost, the drapery & chandelier were put up beautifully and the tables were the perfect size for my guest.

In the process / middle of planning:
Come the second, & third time we meet and we are at the point where we are making changes to our package  (making it cheaper for us) due to the fact that my husband and I are in the entertainment industry (he’s a dj, I own a photobooth and gobo) we basically wipe out the list of fees by half.  Using our own vendors from the florist, cake, dinner caterer, chairs, dj, & our own decor we made it work for us. At this point her excitement / enthusiasm in dealing with our wedding drops.

Fast forward:
We pay our dues and have our wedding.

We paid a little over 6k it included venue, drapery, chandelier and dance floor, picket chairs, bar: beer & soft drinks for 170 guests, and circle tables.

After:
1 week after the wedding she says we are not getting 1,000 out of our deposit because we were 1,000 short. I’m sorry but no, we wouldn’t have been allowed to have the event if we were short that’s across the board with all venues. Nothing we could do since all of our invoices were messed up. Maybe their accounting department needs help I’m not sure where the ball was dropped here.

This also happened:
A month later I get a call about my lost wallet had been found in the bridal suite. I thought they cleaned it before every event but I guess not or else they would have found it. Or maybe they do clean it but they were too busy to call me right away. It didn’t matter any more because I had replaced my license and bank cards anyway.

Side note:
Be careful with your belongings. As their kitchen staff were leaving for the night I saw them leave with a bag containing the light foam sticks we had purchased for our guests, they never asked me if they could have them I would have maybe said ok, but they were for my guests.

Tips:
My point is be very careful if you pay them to have an event there. Keep all paperwork label the invoices/receipts with the date of each visit and take notes on everything. You don’t want to go through the headache we went through looking for invoices / receipts like crazy, I don’t like clutter so a week after our initial email saying we would be receiving our full deposit back I shredded the paperwork. I should have waited.

Get your own vendors if possible I have a funny feeling about how it all works here, when they get you to use one of their vendors. We took a trip to a florist in chino for a quote and as soon as she heard the name Rita she raised her prices on us.

Ending it with: Our guest and I loved the fact that it had the courtyard for guest who wanted to step outside to have a breather or chat. It’s beautiful and it was a good place for pictures. Thankful to their staff who set up the drapery, tables, & outside picket chairs for being prepared and doing their part to have things done in a timely manner. My husband and I chose to make it what we envisioned and I am very proud of all our efforts as well as the efforts of our vendors who worked well with us.</review>

< Text>
The donuts were good and the plain croissant was amazing.  The young woman and man working there were really friendly, helpful and professional.

They also did a great job handling a difficult customer.  She dramatically came back in after one bite of her donut and claimed they had baked a bug in it.  It was a little odd that the bug on it was alive and well, not baked in an oven.  Even though her claim was false, they were very polite to her and tried to resolve things with her.<//Text>

Pre-ordered 2 dozen donuts 3 days ahead of time, young lady on phone did not ask for my contact info name or anything. Didn't think anything of it,until the day of pickup. Was running  late, so I called to let them know, and was told my order was put back on the shelf because they didn't know I was still coming. When I asked how many of the specific donut I ordered they have left in stock the rude young lady told me I can come in and check. Needless to say I'll be purchasing my donuts somewhere else from now on.<//review>< pics>

<Text>I was pleasantly greeted by the folks at the shop. We purchased 3 cinnamon rolls which go for $4 or $4.50 if you want it with frosting. We got home and had them after dinner. 20 seconds in the microwave and they were good to go. We all really liked them.  You don't have to wait for the Fresno Fair, just stop by here and get your cinnamon roll fix here.< /Text>< Pictures>

< Review>
Overall the donuts are good but over time I have noticed the lady that has been working here in the mornings probably the whole time they are open has become ruder and short with customers. I understand they get busy but being rude is only going to lose them customers. If this continues there are plenty of  other shops in the area that can have my business. 2 stars do to poor customer service. If you have a bad day check it at the door and treat others how you would like to be treated.<//Review>

It’s 7am their donut display was empty & had no variety, Donuts did not look fresh, more like stale. One employee was on the ground refilling the fridge with drinks while there was a line to be helped and the other employee in the back was doing nothing. No sense of urgency, walked right out and discovered a new donut shop down the road on Kings Canyon & Fowler called SK donuts! Fully stocked donut display with fresh donuts! I will never return to this place!

SK Donuts is where it’s at!< /Text>

Delicious donuts with a smile! One of the local gems of the Sunnyside neighborhood. The owners are hardworking, kind, attentive, give back to the local community & really get to know their regular customers.
They serve all of the regular types of donuts one would expect, plus a few specialty items of their own too, such as beerocks. They're also one of the few places in town who make Giant Cinnamon Rolls (in the Country Fair Style) and they're just fabulous! A family favorite of ours. It's very obvious the owners take pride in what they make.
Bottom Line: They make great food at a reasonable price with excellent service!<//review>

<Text>Went there to buy some Donuts. Were Met with smiling faces open arms. Very helpful with information about the different donuts, and when they realized I was from out of town they asked where I was going and gave me good tips where to go. The donuts they make taste very delicius and Can only recommend people to give Them a visit, even if you isn’t into donuts. Would give em ten Stars if I could.< /Text><response>None</response>< pics>

<text>My husband and I have been on a road trip and stopped in to get breakfast. It was absolutely delicious! We ordered cinnamon rolls, and while eating the family that owns the place were so friendly and they actually gave us a free Danish and hot dog jalapeno baked good to try.  Both of which were phenomenal. I can't say enough good things! ! If you're in the Fresno area you should definitely stop in!</text><Gmap_id>0x80945f2c8699c4df:0xe1cb783519012088<//Gmap_id>< response>

The guy and lady that were working when I went were extremely friendly! The guy made sure I had enough ice in my drink which rarely happen and it's something I appreciated. And the doughnuts! So good. I'll definitely come back.< /review>

<Review>My husband and I have been on a road trip and stopped in to get breakfast. It was absolutely delicious! We ordered cinnamon rolls, and while eating the family that owns the place were so friendly and they actually gave us a free Danish and hot dog jalapeno baked good to try.  Both of which were phenomenal. I can't say enough good things! ! If you're in the Fresno area you should definitely stop in!<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

I love coming into here. The lady behind the counter is super sweet and very nice When I cone in unlike most of Fresno and the bias business owners I see. Very good donuts always. A suggestion to the person complaining about variety, it's a donut shop. They don't make them all day long. Come in when they hope for a broader selection rather than coast in in at 10.

Don't ever change. I moved away but as long as I'm in Fresno this will be my go to place. :)</review>

I absolutely love coming here. The younger gal is always so friendly and can recommend new doughnuts. The selection is always vast, except the closer it gets to closing, obviously the variety dwindles.<//Text>

I've been in 15 states of these United States. These donuts are the best. Tried them for the first day Saturday and couldn't believe how great they were. My friends said "where did you get these donuts".</text>

There is nothing absolutely worse than a predatory company that gauges people for money. I had an 11:30am appointment for today albeit I was under the 15 minute grace period.

When the woman at the front desk decided to make a 1 minute difference and say that the doctor himself was already behind prior to me walking in.

It is unhealthy and highly problematic to use reverse psychology to try to blame a patient for something the doctor was already behind in.

I understand that there are circumstances, however I would not recommend anyone go to this place.

I have an infection in my tooth that absolutely has caused problems. She offered absolutely no solutions & left a very distasteful feeling.

The only solution she came up with is offering an appointment one month later.

No matter what insurance someone has...it is appalling to see malpractice.

DO NOT COME TO THIS PLACE. There are better companies that actually care about your health more than the dollar.<//text>

My first google review ever...

My appointment was at 10:30 and it is 12:30 now. I am still waiting in a chair for someone to start my cleaning. I got x rays around 11:15 and the doctor looked in my mouth around 11:45. Then they moved me to another room where I am still waiting. I have never experienced anything like this at a dentist office before.

They also already told me about something the doctor wants me to get for $900.

I'm so close to just walking out.

Needless to say I will not be coming back here.< /Review>

The scheduling process is the worst I've come across. Haven't had a single appointment that was scheduled correctly...either had to be rescheduled multiple times, didnt actually check insurance as they said they would, wasnt at the correct time, miscommunication between their own central call center and local office, adding extra duplicate consultations just to bill insurance, didnt schedule the correct procedures or 1.5hr+ wait to be seen.

And then full of excuses/try to blame the patient instead. The dentists themselves are fine, their scheduling is not. They do not have any respect for your time. Dont recommend if you value your time.< /review>

<Date>1597280013369</Date><rating>1< /rating><Text>Terrible choice to go here. I called and it went to their call center where I waited on hold before speaking to some rude foreign person who booked me for an appointment at 3 the next day. Then I come in and the rude guy at the reception said i didn’t have an appointment and I could come back at 4. So I came back at 4. I sat in the lobby until after 5 when I finally got called back for x rays after which I was told to go wait in the lobby. Around 5:20 I got called back and to wait in the exam room and finally at 5:30 someone came back and looked at my teeth for 2 minutes and then disappeared without explanation. Then after 5:45 the receptionist comes back and says they close at 6 and don’t have time to do a cleaning and asked when I can come back for it. I have never in my life had to waste 3  hours at a dentist without getting a single thing done. Then, I finally come back for a cleaning and check in and they called and asked if I could come in early at 2:30 PM. They said to wait in my car and they would call me. About 45 minutes later they called and said I need to have my insurance fax them something and call back once it's sent so once that was done, I called them and the rude receptionist said they got it and hung up.  I finally just decided to leave and that I'd go to a dentist somewhere else. They never called me until 4:45 PM, two hours after my appointment and asked if I wanted to SCHEDULE an appointment to come back and get my teeth cleaned. ABSOLUTELY ridiculous.</Text>< Pics>

<Review>Took my daughter in for a check up, and a consultation with the orthodontist. We had an excellent experience. The staff is super friendly, every service was provided in a timely matter, and they explained each service. This office is very welcoming. My daughter was comfortable with the service, and she actually started the process of getting her braces that day.< /Review>< rate>

Recently moved to the area so I needed a new dental office for myself, my husband, and my kids. It was easy to get an appointment that fit our schedules. Plus the staff was great- from the front desk to the people that took care of us when we went in to see the dentist were all really friendly and answered all my questions (and I always ask a lot of questions). They make going to the dentists office a easy experience.<//review><Rating>5<//Rating><userid>105514243487741140132<//userid>< username>

< Review>
The doctor that handles the root canals is amazing, she was attentive, quick and professional. Her assistant was amazing also. The general dentist at this location is by far THE best dentist I’ve come across. I have PTSD and his professionalism, patience and empathy was by far why I will recommend this place. There is a young woman who looks miserable, who tells you the costs of procedures and can be very rude. However the rest of the front staff is ALWAYS kind and professional. Thank you!<//Review>

<review>The staff is kind, patient, and friendly. It was a pleasurable experience going there as I was hi required to visit more times than I or they had anticipated.  It seems I got a faulty temporary that kept breaking each time I had a meal. While the staff was extremely courteous and reassuring, the lab, left something to be desired (like, less trips to dentist office for repairs of materials that do not withstand normal eating habits). Again, if not for the staff being as good as they are, I would have surrendered my treatment long ago.  However, the staff assured me that this would not happen with the permanent tool, and I have no reason not to believe them.  Thanks for improving services provided!!< /review><response>None</response><Rating>4</Rating></record></dataset><record>

Choose a different dentist/ortho. We're having a horrible experience with this office. They've been closed since early March due to covid-19 ( stay at home order) so we had to miss March, April and Mays' appointments. They never called to cancel the march appointment so we showed up and the doors were locked and there were other patients outside as confused as us. Then they had the nerve to call to collect payments for the missed appointments without any option to freeze, delay or modify the payments due to the extenuating public health crisis. they're response was "well, you signed a contract so you still owe the money" they even had the nerve to say "lots of people are receiving unemployment and are still making their payments". We finally just made an appointment for mid June and they called us back 4 minutes later demanding payment for the last three appointments even though the office was closed and no orthodontic work was received. This company should be ashamed of themselves.< /review>

We had been your customer since past 1 year, but was extremely disappointed with my last appointment for my Son Aryan Abjani. I was already quoted for his treatment with the insurance plan. At the time of appointment on 08/01/2019, I was simply made to sit for long hours after being taken inside by the Pediatric Doctor at your Venice Blvd location. Made to sit for another 1.5 hours without treatment as the doctor was busy attending to other patients and the staff pretending to be working on my treatment estimate which I had already taken on 07/27/2019 along with X-rays and treatment chart. My son was in discomfort due to a tooth infection that never got treated that day for which I had taken the appointment. The assistant nurse did a clean up for him and handed over another appointment date of 09/26/2019. My son had to be taken to another dental office where he underwent a tooth extraction since it was infected.

I am so surprised that being in the medical profession, your team of doctors are so irresponsible, especially with Children. Let me know the name of the Lady Pediatric doctor on duty at the Venice location on 08/01/2019. I will be perusing this matter further with the relevant department for complaints.</Review>

Today I had a tooth extraction! And although I’m older the fear of having to go to the dentist is still scary. But the dentist was so nice and empathetic. She gave me a lot of emotional support and trust me I needed it!!!! Yes I’m in pain because it’s normal after extraction and bone graphing but I feel emotionally supported through this process! Thanks Western Dental!!< /review>

My granddaughter wore braces for 2 years to align her almost perfect teeth.  She lost her retainer and her upper teeth shifted slightly, but Western Dental, unlike reputable orthodontists, offered no alternative retainers,  other than the unnecessary need for new braces.   What a ripoff.< /review>

I have rarely had a good experience at any western dental and I’ve been going to the Hawthorne location all my life.

I never leaves reviews for anything but after they have displayed so much incompetence and lack of care for there patients I’m completely done with them.

I’m going to see them one last time just because it’s convenient this time of year to get my wisdom tooth out and will demand for them to behave professionally then I’ll never go back and you shouldn’t either.</text>

<rating>4<//rating><Review>Don't listen to all the BS below!!! I'm 24 years old and hadn't been to a dentist in FIFTEEN years, and I had a great experience! Fairly quick. It was a second opinion, and I actually trusted their word more than the first opinion. Some of the staff is rude, like whoever it was that did my initial photos of teeth. She was not kind, and didn't tell me what to expect, and just slapped the X-ray cover over me, and shoved the X-ray bites in my mouth. She didn't speak any English, which was really aggravating. Anyway. Otherwise, the service is good. I trusted the actual doctor/dentist, and the man who did the closing and signing out at the end was incredibly kind and flexible. Answered all my questions, estimated prices and told me what I could cut out if I didn't want it done, etc. They even charged my phone for me in the office when it was dying! Overall,  besides the one woman, the staff was nice and welcoming. I'm going back today for another check up and to make up my mind about some things and begin the process of getting braces and and setting up a payment plan for a root canal, which I am really excited about. My wisdom teeth removal will also be free! Yay! (:< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80c2ba5e8321fbb1:0xd113514f51d6a5ce<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I don't mind waiting, but I don't like being asked to wait a second but it turned into half an hour, TWICE in a supposedly 1-hr appointment. Hope the place can respect the clients' time better.</Review>

<review>I made an appointment to get one filling done, when I showed up, I was told that I was getting four fillings. I asked to the dentist to double check my x-ray to see if everything was correct, he came back and said it was. So I got the four fillings done. He couldn’t even numb my bottom tooth. I was in so much pain!! Two months later, the teeth he worked on are hurting! I still need a root canal done, but i’m too scared to go to this place ever again. It needs to be shut down.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

I would give them as 0 star If it was possible. I paid over $5000 for my daughter's bracesAnd every time I went in for an appointment they were at least 30 minutes late. My daughter took off her braces a few months early. They never called us for the retainers when they got in to the office. Then I had to call to find out about the situation with the retainers?  Finally get the appointment made and when we go in the retainers don't fit because a month had passed And they go ahead and make new impressions And try and charge me for them. I cannot believe this office is in business including other ones around the Los Angeles city I'm embarrassed to say I even did business with them.</Review>

<review>I once went in to have a wisdom tooth pulled. The dentist, long overdue for retirement, hit a nerve with the the novacaine and now 3-4 years later, I still have no feeling on the right side of my lower lip. A couple of years ago, I went in for another extraction and asked to have a different dentist work on me. My dentist came in, did his job and as I was on my way out, the dentist I didn't want to have working on me said,  "didn't I just do an extraction on you"? I couldn't believe I had been tricked in such a fashion and that a grown man, a professional dentist, no less, would pull a "nanny nanny nanny"on me. Totally unprofessional place. Like,  "I can work on you if I want to and there nothing you can do about it". So INCREDIBLE DISRESPECTFUL AND JUVENILE!!!  They ought to be ashamed!!< /review><userid>105699246423615477889</userid><Gmap_id>0x80c2ba5e8321fbb1:0xd113514f51d6a5ce</Gmap_id>< response>

First the person I made my son's appointment with gave me an Ortho consultation appointment on a Saturday when no Orthodontist was there. I was also told my son's teeth would be cleaned too. Upon arring to the Sat apptmnt I was asked to fill out forms I already completed online per Western Dental. I was asked why I was there.  I found that weird due to me making an Ortho consultation appt., but told the receptionist (male), Ortho. We waited an hour before being called in. There was only 1 other person in the waiting area (child was being seen).  Xrays were taken. Then we were made to wait another 30 minutes before an actual Dr. came and reviewed stays and then said "your son needs braces," I told him that's why we were there. Eventually the female receptionist came and said there was no Orthodontist there that day and asked me did I tell the male receptionist why we were there when we checked in.  I told her yes I did.  I was then told they couldn't do anything because the Orthodontist wouldn't be there until Monday and they couldn't clean my son's teeth either because they couldn't verify his insurance info that I gave to them when I made the appointment the week prior. Lastly, I asked the male receptionist for my son's dental ins card when we were leaving, he was adamant that he had given I back to me. I explained to him he didn't and gave him the chain of events from me giving it to him initially. He began looking under papers, computer keyboard and other areas of his desk, continually saying "I don't have it I gave it back to you, I wouldn't have kept it." Then he and the female receptionist starting conversing in Spanish while I stood there telling him he did not give it back. I went to my car and retrieved my wallet where I got the ins card to give to him in the beginning. We went round and round. I stood there as he nonchalantly lifted papers and opened the copy machine still adamant about not having it. A few minutes later he openef a drawer and there was the ins card. I WOULDNT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE! SERVICE WAS UNPROFESSIONALLY HORRIBLE from the appointment made with the 800 number right down to the actual facility. They should close that location.  I knew there was a reason I never attempted to use Western Dental.</Review>

It was a mistake to choose this location as my dental office. Three times I  came to the office and was not able to get the service I signed up for, as they came up with excuses: the doctor is too tired, the doctor is running late with other customers. Incompetent staff and management. Today I had to wait for 50 minutes when I was told that I can't get tooth cleaning that I signed up for 6 months ago, although I received about 6 confirmations via email and phone for this day and time. There are always mistakes, and ignorant attitude. It is almost impossible to reach their main office to change an appointment. Their systems get messed up. I will never go there again. Bureau of Consumer Protection, please close down this location so that customers stop suffering from bad service and unfair treatment.</review>

Went here for a routine check up.  The dentist fast talked me like a used car salesman.  Told me I had 7 cavities that needed to be filled.  I let him do the work thinking it was no big deal.  That was in November of 2013.  Here it is January, I have had horrible tooth aches almost every day since then.  I ended up having to go to a specialist and having an emergency root canal because one of the fillings got infected.  I have severe sensitivity in all of the teeth he did work on, and will possibly have to have root canals on 2-3 more of my teeth.  DO NOT GO HERE!<//Text>

I took my 4 year old daughter to this office for her first dental appointment.  The first issue with this office came when calling to make the appointment.  I was informed that they only have the pediatric dentist in the office one day a month.  This is super inconvenient so for that alone I would choose a different dentist for my children.  Then when we got to the appointment the dentist came in.  She did very little to initially create any relationship with my 4 year old.  She asked my daughter to open her mouth so she could look in her mouth.  My daughter immediately complied with no issues.  The dentist looked in and immediately said, "She has cavities."  The abruptness of this shocked me and I pulled a displeased look on my face.  My daughter read this look and started crying in response.  This immediately prompted the dentist to stop the appointment and refer me to a specialist so my seemingly anxious daughter can be put under for dental work.
I was shocked by the lack of care the dentist gave while caring for a young child.  I am grateful at this point that we will be seeing a different dentist and hopefully this one will be better equipped to work with children.  I am very surprised that this dentist is the one that works with children every month.

<Text>this could be the worst office ever the team was fine just that the dentist said i had 4 cavities fine i did it it was covered by insurance, but when it came down to doing my cleaning they said i couldn't get it done even though it was covered because i needed deep cleaning. and i had to pay 1000 dollars. i called my insurance they said they do cover it its just all the rest of the stuff there selling me is whats so expensive.But whats even worse on top of that my teeth hurt so bad since i got my fillings done. i went back to tell them and what they did was file down a teeth that had nothing to do with the ones i had cavities on it was one of my good teeth that he messed up. now its been a week he said the sensitivity would go away. liess its even worse than the first time i went in so unhappy!!!!</Text>< user>

<Text>WARNING. STAY AWAY... Last time I went here to remove a tooth. They removed two teeth. They took out a perfectly good tooth. Then I went here to get one filling in a tooth I felt a hole in. They hacked and drilled three of my teeth that were perfect. Now they hurt. They have gaps in them. They are destroyed. If I could turn back time and never go to this dentist I would be so much better off. The fillings they give are not even good quality like other dentist. Their like a cheap paist they put in your teeth after drilling half of them so your teeth look like a jackerlanting. My teeth was 300 times better before I went here. They destroyed half of my perfectly good teeth. I wish I never went. I'm scared to ever go to another dentist ever. I don't want any more of my good teeth destroyed.</Text>< Pictures>

- 5 STARS
This by far is THE WORST  dental office ever! The are extremely rude and unprofessional, even the 1800 #s customer service people are rude. The staff is rude and have no idea what they are doing. I have so many complaints I can't type them all. In a nut shell they are a bunch of FRAUDS, they've charged me for work I nvr had done and when I tried to speak with the office manager he avoided all my call, nvr returned one and to this day still is avoiding me, nor will they rectify their mistake. At this point I am seeking legal counsel to assist me in this matter.
DO NOT LET THIS OFFICE SERVICE YOU OR YOUR CHILD YOU WILL BE SORRY TRUST ME.
I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY HAVEN'T CLOSED THIS PLACE DOWN YET</Text>

The office manager, a young latin man, was terrible. Total bullying to get more work done than needed and I was denied the FREE dental cleaning I came in to get with my coupon, because this office manager said that I need a deeper cleaning and would not give me my free cleaning. Very very rude office manager but great dentist. Sadly, I cannot give this particular office any more of my business because of the terrible passive aggressive attitude by staff.< /Text>

Making appointment is stupid since you will still wait 2 hours to get anything done.
The appointment is often mis placed and you will come there for nothing. This is the worst office I have ever seen. Plus my filling should have cost $20 per insurance but they said it is $100 and when I mentioned that my rate sheet only said $20 they said that it must be verified with insurance which took 3 days and then they said they can do it for $20; it is total scan.
That is illegal. It should be closed.< /review>

I had a horrible experience here to. This is definitely not a good dentist to go to.. This one and other locations auch as king and denker or halldale are deplorable. Along with the crappy dental exams/work the staff is rude andand they are never on time. Some of the people went to schools like Everest etcetera and I don't believe that are qualified enough to work on people's mouths.</text>

<text>My visit to Western Dental began with a three-hour wait, and was capped off by several doctors crowding a room so they could try to strongarm me into buying more than $10,000 of dental surgery. They wanted to remove five healthy teeth.

My previous dentist and my new dentist have both confirmed that I do not need anything approaching $10,000 in surgery, and that if I did, a much greater portion of it would have been covered by my insurance than I was told at Western Dental.

Fortunately, I had enough spine to decline these unnecessary procedures so I could get a second opinion. I paid for a cleaning and a fitting of a nightguard. Through Western Dental, a nightguard costs more than $230.

The process of fitting this nightguard was painful, as they gave me a mold that was too large for my mouth, and I was left alone in the room for longer than the two to five minutes it takes for the mold to set.

I had already switched dentists by the time Western Dental called me to tell me the mold they'd taken was bad, and they couldn't make a nightguard for me. I asked for my money back. They said it would take 2-4 weeks.

That was April 21. I have since called their office or their billing department every three days. I have been placed on hold for a half hour, hung up on, and promised calls back which never happened. I have left messages with people and machines in various departments and have yet to receive a single call back.

A month ago, I finally reached someone in Billing, who informed me that the branch manager had not even filed the paperwork to begin the refund process. They would need another 2-4 weeks! After finally reaching the manager, he agreed to submit the paperwork.

I learned today from Billing that the manager still has not submitted the paperwork, more than three months after my complaint. I called repeatedly for the manager, who avoided my calls. A receptionist promised me that the manager would call me back today about this. I received no call.

So yeah, I'd say you should avoid this place.<//text></record></dataset><record>

This place is a nightmare, starting to run your credit without your consent and the "head" of the dentist started the job in my tooth and decided that she will continue on the next visit because she had to go to lunch. Oh, I forgot to mentioned that while injecting anesthesia in my mouth she drop the syringe because she was talking to the assistant about the "party" and made me swallow  that... I just hate that place!!!</review>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Review>(Translated by Google) Poor customer service ... one hour after the appointment they call us for the X-rays and there is still another half hour before the Dr. arrives to attend you. They do not know how to treat children. They are rude, my poor daughter only looks at me with tears because only to examine her they pull her lips too hard as if she were not a human being. I definitely do not recommend it. I have removed my wisdom teeth with them and they have treated me very badly ... they have not explained the procedure to me, they only tell me open your mouth ma'am, the first time the anesthesia had not taken effect and I was already removing it tooth. . I came out crying scared. A horrible experience.

Yo me he quitado las muelas del juicio con ellos y me han tratado muy mal.. ni me han explicado el procedimiento,  sólo me dicen abra la boca señora,  la primera vez ni me habia hecho efecto  la anestesia y ya me la estaba quitando la muela. . salí llorando asustada .

<rating>1</rating><Time>1433382976313</Time><Review>(Translated by Google) A definitive bad service the secretaries with a lousy attitude attend nothing kindly to the public especially one of them with red hair the name does not legue to know and then take my girl to a dental cleaning and they treated me like at three hours Bad service I really do not recommend it if Western Dental reads these comments that make changes in this regard

(Original)
Un mal servicio definitivo las secretarias con una actitud pésima atienden nada de amabilidad al público en especial una de ellas de pelo como rojo el nombre no lo legue a saber y luego lleve a mi niña a una limpieza dental y me atendieron como a las tres horas mal servicio realmente no lo recomiendo si Western Dental lee estos comentarios que haga cambios al respecto<//Review></record>

Associated Technical College was an intense boot-camp. The instructors we're AMAZING and if it was not for them I do not believe I would have made it. The school was full of intense projects that definitely challenged you. Get ready to lose sleep and LOTS OF IT! It is a temporary sacrifice for long term gain< /text>

who owns the liquor store down the street told me to get a refund and just go to LA trade tech. The instructors don't even know how to give a proper lecture and are very rude especially Mr.Jakeyl (Or however you spell his name, hopefully he doesn't work there anymore because he was also horrible at giving lectures) The only instructor who seemed like he knew what he was doing was Mr.Runas, Hopefully he realised how awful this school is and leave so that he can go lecture at a REAL college. DO NOT GO TO THIS SCHOOL, IT'S A SCAM!</Review>< Rating>

<Text>I had a wonderful experience getting my Technical Degree there. Anthony Zarate the Job Placement Coordinator was extremely helpful in finding me a job 3 months prior to my graduation date. The skills and knowledge that I gained from my experience there was awesome.

I greatly appreciate the time spent by the job coordinating staff to try and further our careers in the field. After 1 year of employment as a Medical Assistant I went back to get assistance and was given job leads and they set me up for a job interview.  Thank you Christine for your assistance.< /text>

I am pleased to report that Christine Preciado has been helpful to me. She has been very patient and detailed with my job leads. Not only has she helped me with my resume, but cover letters and job applications. She is dedicated and determined to help. Christine loves to stay on top of things to be sure the students reach their goal they worked so hard for.  For exaple, if the student has a certification, Christine will not just settle with minimum. I am very happy to have her guide me.< /text>

I was racially discriminated against, and kicked out of class for asking for help on the home work and asking the teacher to look me in the eye while he explained. Terminated By the director with ever meeting with the person on the issue.<//Review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>First off i just want to say Dr. Eric is one of the best teachers I could have ever asked for! If it weren't for him I would not be where I am today. I started school in Feb '17 and finished Oct '17 it took me a month longer to finish but that's only because I was sent to start early on my 160 hours of training! I'm now happily employed by two brilliant beautiful Dermatologists in the gorgeous city of Santa Monica. I received an excellent education provided by four amazing Doctors here at ATC. Dr. Meza where I learned a few basics before really digging deep into medical assisting. Dr Eric, who actually suggested I be sent out to work early, taught me all there is to know about Dermatology, Pharmacology, Obstetrics and Gynecology, you name it! I'm so grateful to have had such a strict, professional, patient professor; thank you Dr. Eric! My most favorite doctor couple, Dr. Tamar and Dr. Vahik who taught me all there is to know about ECG and the anatomy of the heart. They were my final two teachers and I can confidently say they shaped me into the helpful, detail oriented and knowledgeable M.A. that I am today. Both methods of teaching used by Dr. Tamar and Dr. Vahik helped me memorize medical abbreviations as well as train me on asepsis and patient bedside manner. I miss being at ATC, the diversity was impeccable and about 70% of students are welcoming and friendly. All staff who provided assistance throughout my 7 month course deserves an enormous thank you!! Chris, Kenya, Jessica, Ilse, Mike, Oliver, Natalie, the list could go on, but I just really appreciate all your hard work and dedication; I couldn't have done it without you all. ATC, you guys rock!!< /review>< pics>

What makes this school great is the Job Placement Assistant Advisor Christopher Aono, he's a very Optimistic Guy full of energy always ready to help the Students. Although  I only met Mr. Aono for only a month he has been very helpful for placing me in a clinic to do my Externship. From all the other staff he really reaches out from the rest by keeping in contact asking me how am doing at the clinic. Also he has a good Vibe that brings to the school and for him to be the First person to say congratulations to me for graduating and to say that he's proud of me for completing my hours and getting hired is overall great. Christopher Aono Thank you for your help.</text>

I learned what I needed in order to pass the certification and get a job close to home, so close I walk to work. As long as you do your part there shouldn't be a problem. GO ATC!!

I enjoyed going to ATC and Dr. Eric was a strict teacher but I am grateful for what he has taught me. Dr. Vanik the CT teacher was great. The staff at ATC was great I love the librarian who use to be the financial aid representative. Becoming a medical assistant was the best career choice I have made, for some the journey afterwards will not be easy but remember the job coordinator can give you the leads but its up to you to sell yourself and skills. If you are not sure of yourself volunteer more at the county hospitals and always study. Learn more about insurance and become knowledgeable about whats going on in the medical field. When getting a job become difficult for you step back and evaluate yourself. Christine Preciado the job coordinator has been their for me every step of the way and anything i need she is there to assist me. I statred working right after my internship and the qualities that made me stand out from the rest is the passion i have and the care i give to each individual. Always remember that the medical field for health care providers is to help others in their time of need. God bless those who chose to take this journey and if you focus and have the best intentions you will succeed.<//text>

<Text>The food is strange... we ordered delivery for our office, and all four dishes weren’t that well received. The salad had a mix of cooked warm broccoli and cold lettuce. The chipotle pasta was very spicy but lacking actual flavor — the sausage was oddly so bland you wouldn’t know what you were eating. Shrimp scampi was flavorless, pizza was OK but not great by any means.< /Text>< Pictures>

I am the one who posted the photo of the Shrimp Scampi, oh, you didn’t recognize it by the photo??? It was the one swimming in Alfredo sauce, and you thought it was Fettuccine, tsk tsk. Now, I have a dairy allergy and can eat dairy if I decide to take a my meds prior to. So I wasn’t at all prepared to see an extremely creamy sauce with a side of noodles. Correct me if I’m wrong, but shouldn’t Shrimp Scampi be a pasta of minimal sauce? I thought so, could be just how it is prepared here, tasted like Alfredo sauce mixed with Tabasco, no red rooster lol... Please get it together Palermo, you have one job.

PS. The customer service was excellent, I’ll be barfing this up in a few, wish me luck 👍🏾< /Text>

<text>It changed from the last time i was there.
The burger was 10/10 amazing sauce.
The pizza was also delicious.
I believe they are under new management after reading the previous reviews.</text>< rate>

I was in town on business. Found that this place was close to my hotel. I ordered a "fresh mozzarella and tomato pizza" as well as some meatballs. If you like large frozen meatballs, you will love theirs as they are not fresh. Pizza was ok. Will probably not order again.< /Text>

Stop #46 for @pizzas365: Palermo's Pizza has a pretty standard, pretty average pizza. Maybe a bit too greasy. Everything else is fine and nothing more. 3.0 Stars.< /Review>

<review>Yuck.

We ordered a cheeseburger, a pepperoni roll, and some pasta. My wife didn't seem to mind the pasta too much. The burger was so disgusting, I had to throw it out after a few bites; the meat seemed low-quality and there was some weird sauce on it. The pepperoni roll was neither bad nor good.

Their motto seems to be "quantity over quality".< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

I have ordered from Palermo's Pizza twice. The first time it took an hour and 15 mins for me to receive my delivery which was cold when it arrived. I live about two miles from the restaurant. I called the restaurant and they adjusted my bill. I appreciated the customer service and ordered from them again a few weeks later. This time the delivery arrived within an hour. I ordered the pizza pasta combo. The pizza was cold. The pasta (fettuccini) came with meat sauce, which was not listed on the menu and seemed odd. It tasted ok. That night I had such a bad stomach ache that I had trouble sleeping. For the next five days that followed that meal I had food poisoning. I called the restaurant to complain and the manager said nonchalantly  "oh yeah, a lot of people got sick."  So if you want cold food or E. coli then this is the spot for you.</text>

< Review>
US Turf has been an exceptional company to work with from start to finish! I would recommend them to ANYONE looking for beautiful turf with amazing workmanship and customer service.

Lane was an incredible rep who came out to give us a quote. He was friendly and personable without having a salesman vibe too many people carry. His knowledge of turf was incredible. He answered every question that I had, and he came up with the best design for pavers and turf in one corner of our yard.

I spoke with Meghan a few times over the phone as she would call to confirm appointments, arrival times, and payment details. She was delightful and professional every time.

Daniel and his crew of workers were phenomenal! We've had other landscapers do work in the past, and none of them hold a candle to the US Turf crew. It was evident that they were trained professionals. They got our approval before moving forward with certain portions of the job, and they all worked together extremely well. Their seem technique was so flawless and top notch that even our neighbor was in awe of their incredible work!

Throughout the whole process, US Turf was exceptional! Great company, beautiful turf quality (made in the USA), and the best professional people to work with!</Review>

<review>We felt comfortable using US Turf because of Ryan’s great representation.  Our job took two days and then magic, we had our back yard back.  The installation crew was amazing/worked so hard. Jose, besides being a great crew leader, can do anything.  Only one member of the 4-person crew was bilingual (am embarrassed I didn’t understand his name) and am so thankful for all his gracious help and interface.  In addition, he assisted us tremendously when a problem came up.  We are so pleased with our new yard and can’t thank US Turf’s crew enough for their exceptional work.< /review>< Pictures>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>US Turf did an amazing job and transformed my backyard into exactly what I wanted.  We got a couple different quotes for a large portion of our backyard, and US Turf was very competitively priced. We chose them because Walt was very professional and genuine during the initial quote process. He was very knowledgeable about the product and process, answering all our questions and quickly providing a quote.
During the install, Dylan and his crew were on time each day and continually giving updates, so I would know what to expect each day.  They were efficient and very respectful of my yard, house, and neighbors.
Ultimately, I couldn't be happier with my yard now and my entire experience with US Turf.  Would highly recommend this company to everyone considering artificial turf.</review>< Pictures>

l am thrilled to be able to give this review. My husband and I have been getting a vinyl pool installed in an area that used to be a driveway. It is a very sloped area and had lots of challenges along the way. The pool was finished 3 weeks ago and we just could not decide how to finish off the pool deck area. We had come to the conclusion that we would deck just one side next to the house, but the other 3 sides were still a challenge, as we are on a tight budget to finish and there are so many choices out there for materials. Oh, and did I mention that we had promised our granddaughter that she could have a swim party for her 6th birthday. So we find ourselves with pavers stacked in our driveway to install, but just didn't have the energy. We had contemplated artificial turf at one point and decide to revisit the idea. Now this was on July 20th. We started calling around and ended up with 2 appts from 2 places. The first place left us hanging 2 times for our appt. and we said that we hoped the the 2nd place (US Turf) would make the appt. and give us some good info. Our appt. with them was on Thurs. July 22. with Sam. Oh Sam! Sam showed up prepared, polite, kind and patience. I got a good feeling from him right away. So he proceeded to take measurements, put together numbers and show us samples. I trusted everything he said and what pleasantly surprised at the quote. NOW, the big test! Could Sam get it installed for the Aug. 1st birthday party. He said that they were totally booked but he said "let me try and pull a rabbit out of my hat". He made calls, more than 1, and then pulled a big ole' fluffy rabbit out of his virtual hat! He found a crew willing to come work on Sat. July 31st to make it happen. Amazing! So on this past Sat. morning, the materials were delivered at about 7:30, the crew showed up led by Marcos, (THE MAN) and got started on our little job. THEY WORKED UNTIL 9 PM THAT NIGHT TO FINISH!!!! And yesterday we had an amazing 6th Pink Barbie Pool Party! Thanks to US TURF!!!!!!! Don't think twice about hiring this wonderful business!

US Turf did a fantastic job installing the artificial grass in my backyard. They were professional, courteous and kept on schedule. I would definitely recommend them!</review>
</record></dataset><record>
<pictures>None</pictures><Text>US Turf is absolutely the most dependable, reliable, professional contractor I have dealt with in years.  I was completely blown away how well the project went.  The end result is simply stunning in my backyard.

In the past 6 months, I have been doing major construction at my organizations Dog Rescue and Care Center in Valley Center.  Literally, I had to fire 4 contractors for dishonesty, unreliability and shoddy work.  Even had to go so far to get the Contractors Licensing Board criminal division to go after one.

I was expecting the same thing, but I needed my back yard done and this behavior now seemed to be the norm with contractors.  They are doing you a favor by doing work for you.  I put on my scowl face to be ready for them.  Wow! it was completely unnecessary.

The project started Wed, was supposed to run W, Th, Fr, Mon, Tues.  Believe it or not, Friday at the end of the day, they requested to come Saturday and finish.  I just about fell over with the request.  I was nearly speechless.  Of course!  Are you sure you mean the weekend?

The crew showed up on Saturday, on time, to finish the job.  They also showed up on time every day.  They finished yesterday, earlier than than the contract specified.  What?

They cleaned up the construction debris every day!  Every one of the crew was one hard working son of a gun.  They did their job professionally and they cared about how it looked.  Multiple times they came and got me to ask me how I would like something and gave me options.  They then proceeded to do exactly what was requested.  They did not forget one item.  It was amazing watching the process and procedure they did to make sure it was darn near perfect.

Thank you to all of you whom worked on my home, you have my greatest respect for your skills, honesty and work ethic.  It was great having US Turf work on my home.  I cannot tell you how much I would recommend this company for any project.</Text>< userid>

US Turf did such a great job with our turf installation. From the initial call to get a quote, to the salesman (Ryan) showing up and the project being complete was less than a week. Albeit, we only had a small (160sq ft) project, we were still very pleased with their quick turnaround and excellent communication throughout. Would highly recommend!</Review>

<rating>5<//rating><name>Bonitah H<//name><Review>Where should I start off ... The AMAZING customer service ? The amazing price ? The BEAUTIFUL turf that is placed in my home now ? Please look no further and HIRE US Turf company and I HIGHLY recommend Chase Atkins! We were remodeling our home and wanted to add turf. We came across US Turf and decided to get a quote. That is where we met Chase and he was just GREAT! From the very beginning he told us the different type of turf, from thin to the thickest. How long it would take, the price (they also have military discount!!!!), and how to maintain. While remodeling our home we had alll kinds of issues from flooring, removing our popcorn ceiling, the painting but US turf was the ONLY company who did it right and didn’t give us ANY headaches. They finished sooner than they expected and I couldn’t be happier. I’m not one to write reviews but honestly, they earned it. Thank you US Turf and thank you CHASE! Seriously, the best!< /Review><time>1623293086790</time><pictures>None<//pictures>< GmapID>

AWESOME WORK AGAIN. Several months ago I had US turf do my front lawn based on some friends recommending them. As expected I was very pleased. I had them return recently to do my backyard and again another AWESOME job.
Thanks Chase and your Team</Text>

THANK YOU to US Turf for doing such a phenomenal job in our yard. I was really nervous because it is quite a bit of money to spend and I had five different people come out. Lane was amazing and answered all my questions. He was very quick to respond. Jerry, Marco, and the crew that installed the turf were equally as amazing. They were resoecand went above and beyond in every way. There was even one area where we misunderstood what they were going to do and they came and fixed it as soon as possible. I can’t speak more highly of them! I would recommend them over and over again.</text>

<text>UPDATE 5/20/21: I hired US Turf Pros again to add more turf to our yard. They went above and beyond from start to finish, with great, competitive pricing. I knew the general idea/layout of where we wanted the turf, but the solution they came up with was terrific, and we couldn't be happier.

US Turf, Walt, Marcos, and the whole team were excellent from start to finish. Among the many quotes I received, US Turf was not only the quickest to get back to me and the most reasonable financially, but they were also the easiest to communicate with and find creative solutions to stay in budget. While some companies were comparable in price, others were more than double. US Turf, however, is the full package, and I have no regrets choosing them. They were flexible with our schedule and working around other contractors’ schedules who were working on our property, and provide and install top notch products. Honestly, for the San Diego area at least, I feel confident anyone would be happy starting with US Turf — don’t even waste your time getting other quotes. You won’t be disappointed.</text>< pics>

From start to finish, US Turf exceeded all of our expectations. They were very responsive, professional, had great product knowledge, timely installation, and of course our favorite part, an awesome end product! They helped us pick the perfect pet turf that not only looks great, but is our pup Willy's favorite place to play. Thankfully the turf has made potty training him a breeze with great absorption and less mess to pick up. Thanks Walt for making it all happen quickly, efficiently, and at a great price!</Review>

Unlike other artificial-turf companies I approached in San Diego, US Turf conducted my entire backyard project from beginning to end--coordinating all design aspects, providing a competitive quote, flawlessly installing turf and hardscape, and throughout the entire project followed up to make sure my wife and I were satisfied with the results.  Their customer service throughout was impressive, and their professional installers worked closely with us to make sure they were doing the work we wanted.  Bottom line… US Turf came in on time, on budget, and exceeded all expectations.  Thank you to all the professionals at US Turf for your help and patience.  But, special thanks to Chase Atkins, our project manager, for his continuous communication, expert advice, and meticulous follow through.  You made your company’s entire process easy and always customer focused.  I would not hesitate to recommend US Turf to anyone who is thinking about installing artificial turf, especially if they need help and ideas in the design of their entire project.<//text>

<Pics>None</Pics><username>Clifford Sakata< /username><Text>My wife complains about everything. She complains about the smallest and most inconsequential things. But she was completely satisfied and dare I say happy with the work performed by US Turf. Chase was our sales guy. He came over to my house and gave me some great ideas and was fun to work with! He responds very promptly, which is a huge plus, but makes me worried about his love life. In terms of price, pricing was very competitive and lower than the "national" turf companies that came to my house. Interestingly, several of the guys who worked on my project previously worked for one of those national companies. My wife and I went to the US Turf office to check the colors of the turf. The samples they show you are too small to get an accurate idea of how your lawn will look. We met with Meghan and she was also stellar. She even laughed when my puppy urinated on the turf in their office. Marcos and his entire crew was respectful and skilled. Apparently this company has like 9 crews and Marcos is the best manager. Or at least in my mind, he is the best manager. Lol. Ryan, the boss of the boss of the boss (according to the crew) came over at the end to make sure everything was done properly. The best compliment I can give this company is that they have a culture of positivity. Everyone I worked I was cheerful and respectful and the end product was amazing. Thanks for your great work!</Text>< date>

I love my beautiful green grass from US Turf!  The grass looks fantastic and the service we received from initial consult and design to installation was FAST and Grade A!  Chase was happy to answer all of my many questions, was patient and fast to respond, and provided the best customer service.  We've had several neighbors stop by to complement the turf and we've been recommending US Turf for quality, affordability, and customer service.  (I can't wait to get my planters done, so that I'll finally have my dream yard.)

I received turf quotes from three companies, and US Turf was the best value.</Review>

Chase and Lane drew out some ideas on the spot and brought them to life! Throughout the whole process Chase was responsive to any question or concern so promptly! US Turf was able to schedule my install date so quickly! From initial consult to install was less than 2.5 weeks! We had a custom putting green installed and he sent his best crew to get it done.

US Turf is absolutely the best Turf provider and installer in San Diego, I had multiple bids and chose US Turf, but here are the best reasons why you should choose this company:
1. Timely (responds immediately both by phone and text message and updates you throughout the course of their work on status).
2. Their crew is incredibly courteous, efficient, and they completed an 864 Sq Ft space in 2 days flat working nonstop to get it done.
3. The quality of the work is impeccable, not a single blemish or miscut, exactly the quality they showed us in the samples.
4. They price matched a quote from another vendor but provided much higher quality turf than the other vendor.
5. last but not least, they quoted me the work on a Wednesday and by Saturday morning all the work was complete, incredible turnaround time.<//Text>

The whole team is great and very professional. My company has used them on several large commercial jobs so I decided to give them a shot at my house. It was the hands down the best experience I’ve had working with any contractor. The crew listened to my concerns/needs before the start of the project and gave a quality finished product. Highly recommend and thanks for the great job!!!<//text>

<Review>I am a little overdue with this review, but I definitely owe a 5-star review to the team at U.S. Turf.  I couldn't be happier with every aspect of this project.  A little background: I had a very outdated side yard and a new roommate moving in who has a blind dog that requires special accommodation's. Not a huge project so a lot of landscaping outfits didn't even want to bid on the project. Between the walkway and the gardening boxes was a drainage channel that a blind dog could easily injure itself in or fall in. I needed grass or turf put in the whole area, including over the drainage channel, so that the dog could make a smooth transition from the walkway to the grass dog area.

I always get a minimum of 5 quotes on every home improvement project I do. As a new home owner, I have found that if you don't get multiple quotes, you are going to get ripped off and you also lose the ability to negotiate with the vendors that you trust the most but come in higher than your budget or other vendors quotes.  I had some other landscaping outfits come out and say they can't do the French drain and could only build a plywood ramp to the grass area. They still bid thousands of dollars above what US Turf came in at to get it done exactly to my specifications.  I had one guy come out and say that it would cost as much as a new economy car cost's!!!  The quotes and sales tactics I had to deal with from other turf installers was ridiculous.  Not the case in the slightest with U.S. Turf.  They were by far the most professional turf installer that came out to give me an estimate.

No pushy sales tactics and Walt, my salesperson & project manager, was great. I showed him exactly what I wanted done, he explained to me what my options were, what some potential problems may be that we could run into and how they would mitigate those problems, should we come across them. He was very informative and was able to quickly answer all questions that I had.  Most importantly, he used the term "earn your business", which means a lot to me.  Earning someone's business seems to be a guiding business principal that has gone to the wayside lately.  So many people just give you a quote, tell you that's what it costs and hope that you take it.  They attempt to operate on high margins and low volume.

U.S. Turf definitely went above and beyond to earn my business, answering multiple questions via email and even being willing to answer any questions that my neighbors on the other side of the fence may have, as I wanted to ensure that nothing changed aesthetically on their side of the fence. Their quote came in slightly higher than the other outfit I was considering, but they were willing to work with me and match the competing quote in order to earn my business.  This approach to doing business is how businesses remain successful and provide their customers with excellent service which keeps them coming back and recommending them to their friends. The install job itself was amazing.  The crew showed up a few minutes before they said they would be there and had the entire job done well before I even got home from work! I left my house that morning with a non-functional eyesore of a side yard and came home to a green, beautiful side yard that makes that side of my house so much more aesthetically pleasing. There wasn't even a spec of soil anywhere in the area so they obviously did a very thorough clean up job and even left me the large leftover scraps of artificial turf, like I had requested, so I could re-purpose them as outdoor rugs and mats.

I would not hesitate to recommend U.S. Turf to any of my friends, family, co-workers or even a complete stranger.  They truly did earn my business and when I am ready to re-do my upper yard next year, they will be the first business I call to get a quote and the first business I would give the opportunity of matching competing quotes to. You can't go wrong with U.S. Turf and will be happy with the outcome of your project. Thank you to everyone there!  You guys did a great job!<//Review>< Pics>

So we have a townhome and not the biggest space in the back, which previous owners had done a DIY job on. It had a small patch of artificial grass and about a 5x5 square of pavers - but the ground was all uneven and it just didn't look great. Luckily for us, a contractor friend referred us to a couple different places and we selected US Turf. Here's why:
1. High level of professionalism. Walt contacted us almost immediately after submitting a request for information (on a weekend no less!) we set a time to meet a few days later and he showed up early, with samples to show us, and patiently answered all our questions. He did measurements and was able to give us a rough estimate on the spot for a couple of different options. His team showed up early on the day of install, were pleasant and professional, and did an amazing job.
2.  Reasonably priced - we were expecting the worst and were surprised that the estimate came in under what we had set as our "can't afford that" price.  For the product, responsiveness and professionalism, we think we got a great deal.
3. Efficiency - it was estimated to be a full day job but they got it done in half the time. Since they were the last of the contractors we dealt with over about a month's time, it was great to have them "in and out" so quickly, and with such a great result.

We just had US TURF install artificial grass in our back yard along with a planter box.  They did a beautiful job.  Daniel, Jesus and Juan showed up on time and went right to work.  They were very polite and kept us posted on issues all the way.  They were all hard workers and took pride in there work.  We would highly recommend them to anyone looking to put artificial grass in.   They totally cleaned up our yard and driveway afterward and it looked better than when they came.

GREAT COMPANY AND EXCELLENT WORKERS

THANKS EVERYONE<//Text>

< Review>
From the very beginning communication was amazing. Ryan arrived on time for the estimate, he showed me samples of different turf and let me know the difference. I advised him I still needed to talk to husband to see if we wanted to go through with project. There was no sense of pressure or obligation from him. He sent quote same day and provided days avail for installation. We ended up setting installation the week after. Throughout entire time, if I had any questions, I could just shoot it Ryan’s way and he’d answer with no hesitation. The day of installation, they arrived on time and got to work promptly. Ryan called to make sure where I wanted flagstones placed. He sent pictures. ETA of project was 1.5 days. They finished in 1 day! They were amazing! I honestly couldn’t be happier with work!  I’d definitely recommend! Great customer service and great workmanship!< /Review>

US Turf recently completed their install at our place in North County. The entire process, from start to
finish – from the first phone call inquiring about getting a quote, to the actual installation of the turf –
the entire US Turf crew - Walt, Justin, Marcos - were phenomenal. Getting an estimate from Walter was no pressure at all.  The day of the install went very smooth as well and I was very impressed with how prompt and punctual the crew were. The crew was ready to start and get going right on time. They worked fast and efficient.  My next-door neighbor even complemented the installation crew for their professionalism. I am very pleased with my experience with US Turf and would recommend them to anyone.< /Text>

I'd love to thank US TURF for such a wonderful job that they did on our condo backyard. They were one of the only ones willing to work with a smaller job than normal all other companies wanted a $2,000 minimum. Then I found US TURF and they came out in 3 days gave me us many options of turf I fell in love with the one we choose and they installed it with in the Same week on Friday because we had a party going on on Saturday (House warming). They were professional, quick, clean, super educated and very friendly! We got it installed in OCT 2019 and know it's may 2020 and it still looks like day one! Feels amazing and the quality is the best!! Don't go with landscapers that don't have experience you will end up paying more to fix it!< /review>

<user_id>112888233674176795682<//user_id><text>Awesome sauce! We had seen the Miramar store several times before, so decided to stop in and check on what it would cost to have our backyard done. The staff there were super helpful and friendly, and not at all pushy. We checked out several different types of turf, and went home with a couple quotes to review. We then checked out three other artificial turf vendors in San Diego, but none of them were as good (both financially and customer service-wise) as US Turf. We decided to pull the trigger and have it done. A week later, and after two days, our backyard looked uh-mazing! Everyone was complimenting on how well it was done, and how real it looked. They really exceeded our expectations on cost and looks. It prodded us to do more backyard improvements, and now we just wonder why it took so long to make a decision. The turf was the starting point of a great house improvement.  All of the folks at US Turf were polite, helpful, considerate, on-time, and did a great job.

We wanted to wait for a few months to see how things held up before writing this review. At the five month mark, it looks as great as the day it went in. No weeds, no rain runoff issues (one of our big concerns), no fraying or edging, etc. Everything looks awesome. We would highly recommend these folks to everyone who is the market for turf. Thanks Walt, Chase and team!<//text><user_name>Flying Pass</user_name></record>

Staff could be trained better. We walked in, made our decision, and started check out process. We had to hurry to another appointment so asked to continue conversation on the phone when we left. Sales person said he'd call us "later" so he could help folks in the showroom. We were sitting in the showroom at the time, filling out paperwork! All we wanted to do was give home address and credit card while driving to next appointment. He actually rolled his eyes at us! He almost lost the sale if we didn't insist - if we had more time we would have taken our business elsewhere but couldn't. Easiest sale of his month, for sure. Worst customer service we received, for sure. In terms of the turf, it feels great, looks good, and it's nice that delivery is included in their pricing. Showroom is nice, sales weren't pushy. Range of prices and turf selection is great.</Text>

Chase showed up on time and gave us a fair quote for our replacement turf. We knew it was a small job, but the pricing was more than fair. Chase also showed us multiple products that are suitable for pets. Even with a small material hiccup, the crew came through and completed the job on time. I will definitely refer US Turf to my friends and family, and use them for future projects.< /Review>

Their estimate was competitive and they didn’t try to upsell me when I decided that a lower grade of turf was all that was necessary for my needs. Walt and Chase were always accessible as we dealt with requests from my homeowners’ association. And then they stayed flexible as we worked around my jury duty. The yard looks terrific and now I need to spruce up the area surrounding my great looking turf!< /review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Really love our patch of turf. Walt was incredibly helpful from start to finish and the team that came around to install it worked hard and left the yard looking fantastic! We had our share of bids and we thought the proposal was fair. Even referred my friend who came over the following week and they ended up going with US Turf too. So happy with our decision to go with them!< /text>

<Review>US Turf clearly deserves a five-star rating. I called them Monday afternoon and spoke with Chase. We agreed to meet at 8:00 AM Tuesday for the free estimate. Chase arrived ten minutes early, showed us seven samples of artificial turf, and explained the differences. He convinced us that the slightly cheaper 1 1/2 inch turf would serve us well because it was going to be in a low-traffic area. We were happy to learn that the turf was made in the USA and came with a 16-year warranty. He took numerous measurements and gave us his bid, which we went with. The crew, led by Gio, showed up at 8:00 Thursday morning, immediately got to work, and completed the installation at 3:00 PM the same day. From Monday afternoon to Thursday afternoon, a new lawn in just three days. That's fast!

The workmanship was excellent, exceeding our expectations. Gio's crew cleaned the work area several times during the installation. They took the extra step protecting the corners of our house and gate with cardboard to insure they wouldn't ding them with their wheelbarrows.

Gio's crew was comprised of five workers, who were all courteous, pleasant, and eager to please. They worked quickly but carefully, and nothing was damaged in the course of the installation. They did an excellent job of cleaning up the work area before they left. Afterwards Chase called us to see if we were satisfied with the installation and if we had any questions or concerns. He emailed us a copy of the contract and an owner's manual covering the care and maintenance of our new lawn.

We couldn't be happier with US Turf, and unhesitatingly recommend them. I'd give them more stars if it were possible.</Review>< Pictures>

US Turf was great to work with! When I requested a quote, they were able to accommodate my busy schedule. I really appreciated that they were quick to measure and assess what needed to be done, brought samples for us to choose from, and gave me quote on the spot. They worked with me on my budget as well. Install took one day, and then one more visit to add the pet envirofill (the rain caused a bit of a delay). Our family loves the look and feel of the turf and we couldn't be happier! We've had it for a few months now and have had no problems.<//Review>

<text>We were recommended by US Turf by our father who had turf installed in his backyard so we knew US Turf did an amazing job.

We did reach out to two other small companies, but with the scale of work we had to do for our pool area, we felt US Turf gave us the best recommendation and what they could do for us.

We did hit a minor road bump with our sandbox area, but US Turf ensured that we would be 100% satisfied with their work and we were. We were impressed with how they went above and beyond to make sure we were happy and we are! We LOVE our backyard and our kids LOVE it too!

If you're thinking of hiring a turf company, we highly recommend US Turf. They were professional, always on time and made sure the job was progressing along. Walt and Ryan were a pleasure to work with.  Give them a call, you won't regret it!

Thanks again, Walt and Ryan! You guys are amazing!</text><pics>None</pics><Date>1546467836274<//Date><gmap_id>0x80dbf90377fda24f:0xf361cf0e4a823468</gmap_id><user_id>110163526633202941314</user_id><Resp>None</Resp><user_name>Kim Faber<//user_name><Rating>5</Rating></record></dataset><record>

<review>Such a fantastic company. Walt came out to take measurements and brought samples of artificial grass.  He also came at the exact time of appointment 9am. Set up to have our grass installed the next day. Guys arrived on time at 7am and went right to work. I came home at 4:30pm and the beautiful yard greeted me.  I have and will continue to let people know about US Turff company.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x80dbf90377fda24f:0xf361cf0e4a823468<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Walt and the entire US Turf team was great! They made me feel comfortable and really wanting to work with them. The job went off without a hitch.....product looks great and we couldnt be happier. They understood what we were looking for and put the design into action at a price that was lower than my other estimates. I would recommend US Turf to anyone that was looking for artificial turf and hardscape.... and even those people who were still on the fence. Thanks US Turf!</review>

<Review>Ryan and his team are AWESOME!  I shopped around very diligently as I had time while waiting for the wife's approval. US Turf was clearly the stand out winner, not only from a cost perspective, but from professional mannerism and the fact that they clearly wanted our business.  As a business owner myself, I appreciate every single one of my clients...US Turf clearly has the same ethics.  Very happy with the results in yard.</Review><Date>1529684587361</Date><resp>None</resp>< Rating>

We were referred to US Turf by a few different friends and we couldn't be happier with the decision to move forward with them! From the get go, Ryan was extremely responsive and easy to work with, even when we were very indecisive about if and when we were going to start the project. Once the project started, his team was so hard working, professional, and friendly and even our neighbors noticed how much of a great job they were doing and told us on multiple occasions that they seemed like a great company. Now that the project is done, we couldn't be happier with the end result. It is exactly what we wanted for our two baby girls and our pups and look forward to enjoying our yard for many years to come. Thanks US turf!!< /Review>

They are great! I was putting in artificial turf on my rental home in San Diego, and they made the process easy even though I'm in Florida. US Turf took before and after pictures as I requested. They gave me a good quote and stuck to it, and even finished faster then estimated. They were able to match the neighbor's turf just by looking at it. I didn't know what the neighbor's used. I highly recommend them and would use again.<//text>

<Text>I cant recommend these guys enough. Their customer service is fantastic and their product is definitely top of the line. I like to be well-educated before I make a decision on a product. Ryan took the time to answer all of my questions and even gave me some design suggestions. We love our turf! It's beautiful, low maintenance and our family's favorite place to play and relax. You'll definitely be grateful if you go with these guys.< /Text>< Pics>

<Text>Thank you US Turf for an absolutely STUNNING yard! US Turf was phenomenal from the start - excellent customer service, attentive to all of my questions and requests, readily available by phone and email, very knowledgeable, and best of all: great turf! The install crew was also amazing. They let me know in advance it would be a 2 day job, and then showed up the morning of with about 7 people to try to knock it out in one day! I was very impressed with how professional and efficient the entire process was. They even went above and beyond and corrected some drainage problems we were having. 5 stars for sure!</Text>< pics>

As we looked around at different options we really liked the turf we found at Artificial Grass Liquidators. We found exactly what we were looking for here. We went with a liquidated turf that was in our budget.

It took about 2 days for the artificial turf to be installed. It was a smooth process and the end result is fantastic. The yard looks great and the best part is that the yard does not need to be mowed every week.

I would highly recommend taking the leap and going with artificial grass. It has been worth it to us.< /review><Rate>5< /Rate>< Resp>

I have interacted with both Ryan and Walter on different occasions and feel they offer a great product and reliable service.

We decided to install artificial grass in a shady play area where real grass never grew very well.The whole family has been loving the new turf and there is no question if this was the right thing to do! It all went better than expected. I am really looking forward to lower water bills and not having to spend my Saturdays mowing the lawn. In fact, I am getting rid of my lawn mower!

We had a great experience with Artificial Grass Liquidators and Corey was very helpful through the whole process.<//review>

<review>Do Not use this place! My husband and I found this place and we were pleased with how everything was going to be done so we moved forward with them. We have 2 dogs a medium and small dog and we made very clear to them we didn't want the yard to smell like pee so they said they would put a certain type of sand down to help deodorize the yard. It Never happened they Never actually put that on our yard and the smell is awful and now with summer here it smells worse.< /review>< Rate>

WOW! What an incredible transformation for our San Diego rental property!
Ryan was professional, easy to work with and very efficient in taking care of everything. Installation was done within a matter of days of us deciding to move forward. Incredible as we are used to waiting patiently for any contracting, plumbing etc... breath of fresh air to get this done so quickly!
Knowing we are out of state Ryan sent pictures of the completed project and worked really well with our renters to determine time and minimize disruption to them. We couldn't be happier with Ryan and US Turf and our renters couldn't be happier with us! I would recommend them to anyone with a need to transform a droopy water deprived yard.</text>

I recently did a complete make over on my front yard. The AGL crew did a fantastic job and I would recommend this company to anyone in the market for artificial grass.  My neighbors are so impressed with the outcome of the front yard and how real the fake grass looks. I mean, you actually have to get down on your hands and knees to tell that it is fake. I have had complete strangers come by and asked me about where I got the artificial turf. I am super happy with the results and would do the whole process again if I had too.< /review>

Let me just start by saying, there is no pleasing my grandmother. Having had less a than stellar experience with her gardeners, I suggested she try artificial grass instead. Though she was a little hesitant at first, Ryan and his crew at US Turf were professional and courteous with everything from start to finish. Ryan really made sure all my grandma's wishes, be they unreasonable or not, were all met with a smile. I really couldn't be happier with how nice the new yard looks and feels, artificial turf really does look amazing these days! While my grandmother still complains about almost everything, at least now she's not complaining about her lawn. Thanks US Turf!< /text>

With all the new water restriction that have been put in place in California, I decide to put in artificial grass. It just seemed like the right thing to do. I looked around on the internet an found Artificial Grass Liquidators. They had new, liquidated and recycled.  I went with the recycled turf. Everything went well and I would recommend these guys if you are looking to transition to artificial grass.</text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>I called up Ryan and the team at US Turf after my family got tired of seeing a dirt-ridden, dead lawn for so long. With water conservation demands and a scorching hot season here in California over the summer, we had to let our lawn go but luckily we got a helping hand from US Turf.

Ryan reached out to me after I inquired about pet-friendly aritificial turf and he was even kind enough to send me a sample he had on hand when I couldn't go meet him myself. I'd seen neighbors switch to turf before and I did not like the results in front of some of the houses so I expressed my concerns about getting good quality aritifical turf. Luckily, these guys know what they're doing and the results are spectacular.

Best of all, my dog loves going onto the turf yard, rolling around, and laying out there all day--when she comes in she has no dirt or bugs on her so there's nothing to clean up. If you're considering turf, I strongly recommend you give Ryan a call. 5 stars for great customer service and a stellar product.< /text>< pics>

Even though it was additional work, they quickly took action and resolved our issue. I got the turf that I need to finish my project and everything turned out great.</review>< Rating>

This place was really nice and clean. I made a appointment and they got us right in. The staff was friendly,  professional,  accommodating, and did really good work. They did my pedicure in a timely manner, paying was fast and easy. The place was really clean, and so was the tools they used on my feet. Thank you for such a great experience.< /review>

I really wish I lived closer to this nail place. My cousin and I always get our nails done together when I come visit and have loved it every time. My acrylics last longer from here than most places. Mary has done my nails more than once and she does a great job every time. I went here on Monday & got a full set & pedicure. My pedicure was done by King & i can honestly say that was the best pedicure I've ever gotten. I had stubbed my toe causing me to have an ingrown nail after it had broke. He fixed it and my toe feels SO much better. He kept making sure he wasn't hurting me while thoroughly fixing my nail issue. Love this place!!<//text>

<review>Amazing experience all around. I came in this Sunday morning and they were able to get me in right away. I had a previous old acrylic set on that I needed off and the girl who helped take them off was so gentle and took her time. She moved me to another station and I had Tina as my nail tech and she knew exactly what I wanted and the shape. I’m beyond happy I found this salon and will be coming here. They have a lot of selection of colors and gel polish they even have little chairs for kids if you bring them. Super cute and CLEAN SALON. Thank you Tina for a wonderful experience.< /review>< user>

My first time visiting this really cute, and specifically clean nail shop. The staff was courteous and were dressed in cute and comfortable uniforms. Looking around the shop they had a sign saying that they do not reuse instruments and send you home with them. My tech was Mimi, and she did a great job on my nails plus a really cute design. Very positive first experience and will definitely be revisiting them.</Review>

I've been coming here for several years now and you know you've found a great place when all the employees know exactly what you want as soon as you walk in. All I have to do is choose my color. King and Evy have done an amazing job with the business and every single employee that works here is kind, considerate, knowledgeable, and trustworthy. My only suggestion is to get there early because this place gets BUSY! Fashion Nails and Spa for the win!!!</Review>

Very dirty floors, the nail tec burnt me with the drill several times and even when I told him that he was hurting me he didn’t stop. Took forever to just get the tips on my nails, and to just get a seat(there was no one even in the salon). I paid over 50 dollars to get horrible acrylic nails, super thick and when I asked for gems he said that they couldn’t give me any and for no reason. The whole process took over 2 hours and I wasted my money. They were also very rude, they wouldn’t even talk to me. This is a horrible place and they should be shut down.< /review>

<Review>They can usually get you in quickly. The quality of service varies greatly depending on the technician. I have very sensitive skin which can react badly to waxing, but I usually do really good with their waxing services. I wish they did the color dip. I believe they do the acrylic dips now.</Review>< gmapID>

Honestly the first time I came here -I left with a great impression. My nails looked great. This time my nails turned out so terrible I couldn't bare to say anything because I didn't know where to start. Danny was messy, my nails turned out this weird almond shape instead of just rounded, have bumps all over them, and nail polish was left all over the sides of my finger nails which I was told "would wash off eventually when I wash my hands." He seemed to have to wipe off nail polish off the sides of my nails every single time he painted. I just hoped the entire time he was working that it would be better than I thought it would be, but it wasn't. Not sure I can come back here. 30 dollars wasted.

Update: went back a few weeks later and was seen by Evy. She did a great job and definitely made up for my last experience. I appreciate it.<//Review>

The person who did her nails was going way to fast and messed up multiple times and also cut her on her toes while she was getting a pedicure. I recommend not going to this place as they were rude and pointing at both of us while they talked in their language. I asked for gel and they gave me cat eyes... Even when I had asked them no I didn't want them.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80db7c5394ee2ab9:0x9d3f532a6dc50c54<//gmap_id></record>

I was getting a fill from King, and he cut me, 3 times! My nails looked fine except for the red spots from where the nail drill hit my skin. I was not really happy, as I was going somewhere fancy and needed my nails to look good, not all cut up. I’m not very impressed, but other than that it was okay.< /review>

Ok, but prices are not cheap anyways. That is close to my place, so I take my cat there when it's needed. Right now - they make a lot of precautions about Covid, which is good. They don't let people inside at all. Which unfortunately making it less reasonable to pay for some procedures so much.</review>

Wonderful place to take your pooch. They’ve always treated Wally great. He loves seeing Maddie and all the docs, and doesn’t even mind getting groomed and bathed there.< /Review>

This place is incredible. Especially with more exotic animals, in particular the vets here have taken excellent care of my pet rats which some places do not do.<//Review>

<Review>45 minute wait and then had to go back to work.  Never even got to see a vet while other patients were flowing right thru the waiting room to see their vet.  The front office kept telling me they haven’t forgotten about me and they were super busy.  That was great for the first 10 minutes... they need to schedule better and shift patients to other vets OR have patients running way over time to schedule another appointment.  Instead, they told me to schedule another appointment another day.  I had to drive an hour round trip and take 2 hours off of work for absolutely nothing.  Enjoy the wit if you choose to give Arbor your business!< /Review>< pictures>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>Best staff and most caring, kind, patient Drs for your furry family. This is Jax. He's a cocoa pomeranian and will be 4 April 7th. I've had him since he was 8 weeks old. He's been going to Arbor since the day after I got him. His main Dr. Has always been Dr. Andrew, but yesterday March 6th 2020, he had to be rushed in. Was there the entire day. Dr. Andrew was out and I had the pleasure of meeting Dr. Sherry. She went out of her way to really make sure she checked him in extra areas even after, exame, xrays, pain and inflammation meds. Then she spent more than the time I'm sure she had to explain everything in great detail. That's how Dr. Andrew is, so I'm sure that the rest of the Dr's there have the same high standards. I highly recommend them.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<review>I have taken my Poppy girl here a few times now. We have seen two different Vets, and both were comforting, thorough and provided great care to Poppy. Front desk staff is always nice and inviting as well. I will continue to bring my lil one here for a long time! Thank you Arbor!</review>< Pics>

Arbor Animal Hospital and the entire team is by far the best vets office.
Dr. Mabley has taken excellent care of all of our kitties as well as their humans. His honesty, compassion and care is much appreciated.< /Text>

< Review>
I want to express my gratitude to the staff and kind veterinarian at Arbor Animal Hospital who saw our family’s hamster a few days ago.

She was not eating well, and had developed wet tail disease. I had called five or six other local veterinarians and veterinary hospitals, only to be told that their staff did not see rodents. It was a great relief to be told that the Vet at Arbor would see little Popcorn when we had been turned away at so many places.

I knew the odds were against our hamster, as wet tail has a very poor prognosis. And indeed, Popcorn did not survive. But the fact that this hospital was willing to see us, and after she had passed provided a blanket to swaddle her in along with some flowers, shows the depth of their kindness and consideration. Thank you so much.< /Review>

We have been taking our cats to see Dr. Andrew for many years.  He has an amazing way of calming them and is very gentle.  We trust his advice and know that he has the best interest of our pets in mind.<//review>

<review>They cared for my dog for over 16 years... surgery, chronic illness, general wellness and end of life.  Every visit and call met with compassion, clarity and expediency.  Weekend hours.  Dr Peth was out vet and so kind and simple in the best way.  Other vets seen in a pinch and were great too< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Gmap_id>

<Review>We have used Arbor Animal Hospital for many years and have been entirely satisfied with the courteousness of the staff and the professionalism and competency of the veterinarians.  Because we raise service dogs, their care is extremely important to us.  That's why we use Arbor and recommend it to all of our friends.< /Review>< pictures>

I have no complaints with the Vet. She is a very good vet . However I have complaints with their grooming service. I took my 6 month old Maltese Shitzu puppy for medicated bath & grooming. I could not recognize my dog when I went to pick her up. She was shaved completely and and an open cut bleeding in her leg and distressed!!!! I had asked for a bath & medium cut not shave!  I was told she was shaved because she had Matts and was being naughty ! Had to shell out $65 for a shave I had not asked and for harassing my puppy! My puppy  had had her previous grooming sessions at Petco and had no problems. As my vet recommended their grooming services we took  our pet there. If the lady who groomed does not like working with dogs she needs to be fired from her job! If you love your pet please do not use their grooming services! They literally abused & ill treated my puppy.wish I could sue them !!<//review>

The staff is really friendly and knowledgable. The doctor was great with my dog even though my dog was extremely nervous. I paid what they quoted me and I didn't feel like they are out for your money. Thanks so much Arbor- I will definitely be bringing my dog back!< /review>

<Text>If you are looking for an animal hospital with great office staff, great doctors, and reasonably priced look no further. I recommend Arbor Animal Hospital to all of my friends. I drive from Orange to Irvine for all my pets care. I never have to worry about the type of care my pets will get or if it will be over priced.</Text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>The initial visit was just ok.  I called the next day to get the vet's suggested prednisone prescription.  I called 3 times, each time they said they for sure would have the prescription ready the same day.  No one EVER called me back.  I ended up getting the prescription from another vet.  My dog has lymphoma and I stressed the importance of him getting on something right away as he couldn't even come down the stairs.  I guess it didn't matter to them because no one called back.  Not even the next day.</Review>< pictures>

Our experience @ Arbor continues to be simply THE BEST!!  Our beloved chihuahuas Rusty & Roxy are very well cared for by Dr. Megan Whisler. She loves our precious dogs, they know it & it's plain to see. My husband Kris & I feel grateful that Dr. Whisler provides specialized meds & treatments that our senior dogs need.   Each staff person is kind & knowledgable as well! Everyone @ Arbor cares & listens to any/all concerns. Thankyou Arbor ; for your genuine loving service ! Sincerely, Kris & Val Yoder<//text>

Hi everyone,

My name is Jim and I am writing a review about the flashlight store called the Illumn. The Illumn store has been open for the last 10 years and is owned by a man named Craig. I can't say enough good things about the store and it's owner, Craig. Illumn has an extensive list of many different brands of flashlights, which are at very good prices. I am fairly new to the flashlight scene and had many questions. I emailed Craig MANY times. Craig was always quick to respond and answered all of my questions. I ordered the light I wanted and received it quicker than scheduled. After receiving my light, I fiddled with it and messed it up. I informed Craig that I had a problem and he called me promptly at the time we scheduled. Without hesitation, Craig sent me a return shipping label and is fixing what I had done to the light, which he did not have to do. Illumn is the first store I will be visiting for my flashlight and accessory needs. I would give it more than 5 stars. So check out the Illumn store for all your flashlight and EDC gear needs.< /Review>

Heard about them online and found that their store is close by so I thought I'd stop on in to take a look but the shop is closed to prevent the spread of covid.

When I arrived I found a sign on the door to order online and then texted them so they can run out my order.

I ordered two batteries for the price of one and they even included a nice zippered case to protect them. Cheaper than buying from eBay. And its a trusted source.

Their service was very fast and prompt.
The products that they sell are authentic and high quality goods.

I will be back when they finally open their doors, after all this covid scare is all gone.

All in all, an awesome store. I will recommend them to many of my friends and family.<//text>

If you are looking for LED flashlights, whether it's for weapon light, home use, car use, camping use or carry use, look no further as ILLUMN is the perfect place to shop! Thanks ILLUMN for hooking me up with Olight Odin Mini Limited Edition in gunmetal grey. Prompt shipping - usually ships out within 1 business day. I'm a fan of Olight products because they are reasonably priced and they have models that are rechargeable with magnetic charging cable. No need to keep buying batteries. Olights are made in China but so is iPhone. Build quality is very nice. Will buy more again.<//text>

I had to work with their customer service due to the fact that I messed up the shipping. Customer service was quick to respond, was friendly and easy to work with. I appreciate how speedily they fixed the problem that was totally my fault. Illumn has great customer service! I will always order from them if possible. Craig S. made me a customer for life. Thanks Craig!<//review>

illumin is awesome!  I have placed two separate orders with them so far.  Both orders came quickly.  On the 2nd order, one of the flashlight had a manufacturer factory installation problem where the glass lens was not sealed and rattling.  Defect makes this flashlight not waterproof.

illumin quickly responded and shipped out a new flashlight.  illumin even let me keep the bad one!  As it was really not illumin's fault, I offered to partially pay for the new flashlight.  But they politely declined.  Great customer care and service.  Will continue to shop there.

Exceptional customer support and friendly service.  I came across these folks while surfing for batteries.  Learning they are located minutes from me and carry a great selection of top quality Flashlights, chargers and BIY flashlight parts in addition to their extensive battery selection is a nice bonus.  Pricing is very competitive and the staff well versed on their products.  Will be a customer for years to come.< /Text>

<Review>Purchased batteries from their website, I mistakenly chose the wrong version as there are countless.  No where as an online shopper did I read **Batteries are NOT able to be returned**.  My package of batteries were unused and unopened as I requested a return the same business day I received the item.

I was told there are NO returns "as batteries are considered consumable".  No store credit, no return, nothing....Highly disappointing considering the competition.  I will not and cannot recommend this company to anyone.  Buyer beware with my misfortune and if you suspect a defect you are SOL with Illumination Supply LLC.< /Review>< Name>

< Review>
Their product, pricing, and service are wonderful. After having my beloved light for several years, it finally died. It was still barely in warranty. Craig gave me a huge credit on the next headlamp purchase, and he threw in a couple of batteries! They are great folks. I am thankful for them because I am tired of buying on Amazon, sometimes you get fake products. I am now going to buy a charger, and only from them.

PS I bought the fancy charger, a couple batteries, and a real nice headlamp. I could not be happier. I purchased them on the phone and he directed me toward a better charger that was actually a little bit cheaper. You can't get that from Amazon!!< /Review>

I was given their information from a friend, when said friend learned I was shopping for 18650 batteries. Illumn has a great and stocked selection of batteries for various needs, very fair pricing, and knowledgeable helpful staff. While you're there, check out a high quality flash light for good measure. Thanks Craig for your help today and I'll be back the next time I need to replace my current batteries.</review>

Very knowledgeable staff. Very reasonable: they understand the problems finding reliable suppliers and dishonest marketing. Very professional: willing to listen, capable of hearing, able to reflect concerns. Very proactive: checked on competition pricing for sale items and improved their position. I went in with a reasonable budget and increased my purchase simply due to the staff. I was able to pick up: a smart 18650 charger, protected cells, un protected cells, high capacity cells, a high candela spot light, find a fabulous “firefighters “ angle head 2500Lumen!! Great price!, finally understand the ?Orolight? System (proprietary batteries)< /text>

Great service and great products. Purchased a mid sized flashlight for work. The quality and price of the light is unbeatable. As a bonus the light came with more accessories at no cost than anywhere else. Will purchase from again in the future.< /Text>

A great place to purchase DIY flashlight items, great quality at a great price. Above all excellent customer service, for example: during one of my builds, I broke the center out of the "pill" for my led drop in component.

I sent him an email describing what I had done...and made it clear that it was my fault. I asked if he had a separate pill, and indicated that I would pay for it and the shipping cost.

He sent me the whole drop in...free of charge. Now I''m sure that he couldn't afford to do that all the time....but it's nice to see someone put their customer's satisfaction before any profit to be made.< /text>

I apologize for any inconvenience, but we did absolutely everything we could within reason. Our webstore automatically emailed you at 7:20AM when you placed your order. Our email system is based on google apps, so it is unlikely it did not make it to your email.\n\nOur employees are all working hard to ship because of Black Friday/ Cyber Monday, so we are not able to get to the phone. It is clearly stated in our voice mail message to email us.\n\nThe first email communication from you was received at 3:56PM PST, and a paypal dispute went out to us shortly after, at 5:35PM PST. We refunded you in full immediately as it was clear you did not want to purchase from us anymore. I now see that you're posting up negative reviews across other platforms, so I am responding to you so that both sides of the transaction are visible."}</Response>< Gmap_id>

<review>Best batts, chargers, n lights around; skip the big box stores, or questionably cheap online lights. Top quality, best price, great service, and a lot of knowledge is available if you ask. I always need high amp drain batts with good mAh (run time), and they have several types in stock. 10/10</review>< Pictures>

It is now the 16th of January I ordered on the 28th. I still have not received my Package. At first I selected the wrong battery which they emailed me back and fixed it but it took almost a week and a half just to do that. Then my order never went through to send it so they messed up in that end. This is supposed to be a 2-3 day delivery.  I am very displeased as they need to get they're online ordering taken care of and its damn near impossible to get someone on the phone. Very disorganized and not pleased.<//Text>

<Text>My mom and I have been coming here for over 10 +years. The view has always been to die for but lately it has become grungy and poorly taken care of. There were 5 seated tables total while we were there and our eggs and potatoes came out cold. Our bacon was soggy after asking for it crisp. They then brought back new bacon that was literally black and inedible. We love this place. We will always come and support their bakery but we will not be going for lunch or breakfast anytime soon. Absolute waste of money.
The downstairs seating next to the dumpsters looks downright disgusting. Really hoping they make some improvements because it seems like they just don’t care anymore 😞<//Text><pics>None</pics><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80dce5b549b136b5:0xf8e0c73b80b29a02< /gmapID></record>

<Response>None</Response><Text>Stumbled across the place while in the area, and had the whole inside to ourselves. Everything we were served was amazing, and some of the items were cheaper than what we pay at a generic restaurant back in my city, though it tasted ten times better. They make different desserts daily and brought out a whole platter of their items when we asked for a dessert menu. It’s cute and has great views!< /Text>< user_id>

Very good food. We sat outside with a heater and it was a wonderful view as well. There’s wonderful bread with a house-made herb like butter to start. We shared a bottle of the Sauvignon Blanc, got the seafood platter, shared the lobster bisque, my fiancé got the salmon salad, and I got the rack of lamb. My rack of lamb was a bit over cooked, but they made me another one right away. They were overly kind about it. I don’t normally ask to get this remade, but I did this time due to the price point and the fact that it was my first time having lamb lollipop (I didn’t eat meat for a very long time). We didn’t have any dessert, despite French pastries being my favorite type of dessert. Definitely recommend!< /text>

Friendly and great service. Breathtaking views. Had the opportunity to watch beatifull sunset over Laguna beach. Dinner was also excellent,  the seafood crape,  lobster 🦞 bisque was very good and one of the best Tiramisu I ever had. This is one of kind experience I'll remember for rest of my life. It made my business trip to  South  CA worthwhile.
Update,  looks like I will be coming back in few months and I'm looking forward visiting C'est La  Vie.< /Review><Gmap_id>0x80dce5b549b136b5:0xf8e0c73b80b29a02</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>The food, vibe and customer service was mediocre and I do not recommend.

I want to praise the great customer service and attention that server Alex gave us while there.
At the same time, I would like to condemn the actions and attitude of the server named Justin.

My boyfriend and I sat ourselves and the whole time we were there, Justin who was supposed to be the "assigned" server, NEVER checked on us, brought us anything, or took our order.

Instead, we were served and attended by Alex. While Alex was serving me, I hear Justin calling out to him in a condescending manner and ordering him around while Alex was busy attending other guests. This was very rude and disrespectful to do in front of customers.

The whole time we were there, I overheard Justin tell other guests multiple times how he was glad that he had a server to help (referring to Alex), as if Justin was Alex's master. Very rude and unprofessional.

At the end, I went up to the owner named Jose and explained to him the situation to which all I heard from him was a "thank you and sorry for the inconvenience". His response wasn't that of an understanding employer but more of an annoyed boss that isn't planning on taking actions to correct the situation.

Overall, this placed has a toxic work environment and I feel bad for the good workers that have to put up with it.

I gave this place a shot but will never be coming back and I hope it shuts down.< /text><Date>1615585405356< /Date>< response>

<username>Alexandra P.</username><user_id>113691804709252364228< /user_id><Text>The lunch atmosphere was pleasant and the ocean view patio made dining so much more relaxing. All of our food was very good, flavorful, and had a good presentation. The service was okay, could have been better. The lady at the dessert counter was NOT pleasant at all. She was short with me and I did not feel welcome at all, as I was trying to purchase an item like everyone else there. When I walked over to be with my party, she got in my face (assuming I was not with them) and said 'yeah...' I then simply stated, this is my husband ( a white man, and I am Black/multiracial) and though she might not have expected that, it was unprofessional for her to make assumptions because all people should be treated the same.

Our waiter was fine, but seemed overwhelmed and it took a long time to get the check. The lemons requested took a long time as well, but again the view made the time pass quicker so there were no complaints. I feel my rating is mostly effected by my initial experience with the lady working the pastries. I had a 10% Yelp discount, that they honored, but I went ahead and tipped on the higher amount. So the long and short--the food might be good but if people are treated poorly,for whatever the reason it may be, the entire experience is ruined.</Text>< rate>

Like 2 other families dining inside.

Around $23 for Salmon Salad that i got.
Salmon was good and salad was a salad. Fresh salad nothing especial about it but it was ok. (I dont really like olives so i left a happy face with them at the end. 😄)

So Larry attended me right away and i sat outside because i chose so.
They brought me those delicious bread with side of butter.
Few minutes later they brought the salmon salad.< /Review>< pics>

<Review>Pastries were bad and the experience and service was extremely off-putting.

We asked a waiter if we could sit in the mostly empty restaurant after ordering pastries from the bakery — the waiter said choose any table. After ordering, we went to sit down and a woman comes out yelling at us, telling us to sit at this small table section by the street. I explained that the waiter had told us we could pick a table and the woman responded “I would know where you can sit, I’m the owner.”

There’s a polite way to ask people not to sit somewhere, but this was just aggressive and demeaning. It felt like I was being angrily shamed for having a simple misunderstanding.

The cheesecake was also pretty terrible. It was greasy and had an almost grainy texture.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

Cute place right on the water. We were not satisfied with the server as it took him over 10 minutes to grab us water for the table. The service was very slow, but there were not many people there so we were surprised by this. The benefit is that you do have ocean view while eating. The calamari was not the best and niether was the crab cakes. The group of 4 of us would probably not go back.</text>

Complimentary mimosa/champagne when you order Sunday brunch. Great French ambiance with a view of the ocean.
Free parking behind the restaurant!!!

Highly recommend the French onion soup.</Review>

< review>
Pastries were bad and the experience and service was extremely off-putting.

We asked a waiter if we could sit in the mostly empty restaurant after ordering pastries from the bakery — the waiter said choose any table. After ordering, we went to sit down and a woman comes out yelling at us, telling us to sit at this small table section by the street. I explained that the waiter had told us we could pick a table and the woman responded “I would know where you can sit, I’m the owner.”

There’s a polite way to ask people not to sit somewhere, but this was just aggressive and demeaning. It felt like I was being angrily shamed for having a simple misunderstanding.

The cheesecake was also pretty terrible. It was greasy and had an almost grainy texture.</review>

<response>None< /response><text>Wasn’t the best experience. They have a sign that explains about happy hour at lunch but when you get in, there is nothing. We ordered burger which came with sourdough and was really stiff. The smoothie has more water inside. We came to eat crepes but at 2pm they were already out of them<//text>< Name>

<Rate>3<//Rate><text>Cute place right on the water. We were not satisfied with the server as it took him over 10 minutes to grab us water for the table. The service was very slow, but there were not many people there so we were surprised by this. The benefit is that you do have ocean view while eating. The calamari was not the best and niether was the crab cakes. The group of 4 of us would probably not go back.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x80dce5b549b136b5:0xf8e0c73b80b29a02< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>They had a Paris breakfast special for $10, it says on a storefront sign but upon payment I was charged $15. Turns out I didn't pick the correct Paris breakfast meal. I forgot the explanation the waitress gave me but turns out there's 2 Paris name meals. Why would you name 2 meals with the same name? I didn't even point to the menu, I just asked for the Paris breakfast, waitress didn't ask me to clarify which one. Though they did adjust the charge. Service is great here. But food is not so good..... They gave me stale 4 leaves of greens and a think sliced watermelon left out for a time. Sausage link was not hot... As if they didn't cook it enough. Will not come back again but it is a decent place to have breakfast and the staff here is very friendly and great at what they do.</Text>< resp>

< review>
We loved sitting by the window in this little French restaurant. Wasn’t crowded at all on a Sunday night, and the service was quick. They have awesome dinner specials between 4 and 6 PM. We ordered the salmon sauvage and it was tasty. Salmon was so tender and the sauce was excellent. The veggies could have been more tender. Complimentary French bread before the meal was good, and they gave us more than enough for two.

We also ordered their chocolate bomb dessert to go- so good! Chocolate mouse filling inside a chocolate shell. The whipped cream on top was too hardened, so we ended up scraping it off. We would come back here again.</review>

Very good food! Porkchops and rib eye steak was fabulous! Server's seem to not know what the happy hour & food specials are that are posted just outside the restaurant. One said it was just Mon-Fri, another said its for inside dining only (we were outside on the balcony) The manager was very nice & apologized & made sure we were properly taken care of.< /review>

Streetside appeal beacons one come hither.
Entry dessert display and sales counter are the hook.
Decor, atmosphere, flow of table seating and bar area are the line leading you to the Oceanside deck where continued decor and atmosphere are the sinker.
I'm in!

Host, server, owner were all attentive and friendly.
Menu is extensive.
Quiche was to die for. Gorgeous. Flavorful. not America's typical shaken and stirred pie. This was layers of whole spinach, fresh sauteed mushrooms topped with gooey thickness of cheese resting in a no-crumb-left-behind pie crust.

Husband's burger on toasted brioche was perfection.

The dessert tray was successful at inviting to even the most full stomachs to eat just a little bit more our selections were tough, dry, weak flavor.

I liked C'est La Vie so much that I feel bad giving a review of less than 5 stars.
We vacationed in Laguna Beach. I feel familiarity with a restaurant and therefore, reviews need to be based on more than one meal.

A must go.<//text>

Good food and portions, good drinks, and best desserts. And great staff.

Inside diners be warned: the management has the upstairs tables too close for effective social distancing, and management does not enforce nose and mouth coverings when patrons walk around inside. I wish the management placed a higher value on CDC guidelines for those of us trying to stay well and not catch CV-19 from inadequate table separation and patrons who put others at risk from not covering their nose and mouth when maintaining 6 feet separation is not likely.<//Text>

This place definitely made my list - I had the bone in rib eye, OMG it was flavorful and just melted in your mouth.  The magical mushrooms were also very good and a good side dish with the steak.  Other very notable favorites were the Tuna tartar, Shrimp appetizer and the mac and cheese, all were amazing.<//Review><response>None</response>< Date>

Cedar Lane Roasted Chile Relleno's are the best!  I get them for $3 each, frozen, at our local Grocery Outlet and they are really good.  Lots of protein, gluten free, easy to microwave and a lot of flavor.<//text>

I've never had a meal here that I have been disappointed with. The service is great and options are immense. The bathroom however wasn't kept up well and also the tables are wobbly. You have to overlap the stables to make them steady. I go to this place often and its good everytime!</Review>

<text>Very good food! Porkchops and rib eye steak was fabulous! Server's seem to not know what the happy hour & food specials are that are posted just outside the restaurant. One said it was just Mon-Fri, another said its for inside dining only (we were outside on the balcony) The manager was very nice & apologized & made sure we were properly taken care of.<//text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNhTEtWrqUQSLiSV7dLe_wsu0j559PfpBAGM_en=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNMWuKfaFGmyZoeavCKOL2XfMFsPby3yN0B30hn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPJ3LdCSMWOr4l9iciF9n1jBFNWwFWPsWVtPCoD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPScl75WvcxhYHRjkY0AaCyBkSDKcu8E4DjMLIU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMeplZ_nYrLWbC_SQBrdtStHQjkZ-X-FHOBbxXt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< resp>

<Review>Only been there once but was immediately impressed. C'est La Vie with goat cheese was extremely delicious and the corn bread (with chilli) is a must-have item. If you have scramble egg, order Smoked whiskey fennel sausage, mushroom, baby spinach scramble.

You'll find a ton of truly authentic French delicacies like the Monte Cristo, savory and sweet crepes, and quiche. The house special crepes were good but didn't come with any sides. The Monte Crispy, French onion soup, and ham & cheese croissant were perfect. The smoked salmon and avocado Benedict was just ok. All the textures and flavors mushed together. The only place you want to sit is outside on the balcony overlooking the ocean. They also have a great bakery. Coffee is also high quality. Downsides are parking and price. That's what you get when you eat near the beach though.</review><userid>106762625288133908921<//userid>< Rating>

HORRIBLE MANAGER (whoever was manager 12/22/20 at 330pm)we drove in from out of town to eat here with reservations at 330pm. The manager told me we close at 4pm and we can’t seat you. I told him we have reservations and we tried calling and it was disconnected. Said there’s nothing they can do. It’s a shame that you have someone like this leading your staff we WILL NEVER come back due to this man.<//Text>

You really pay for the views of the beach. One piece of fancy dessert is $11. Coffee is $5. I had the pear walnut tart. That was probably my first time eating a dessert at a French restaurant. If that's how a French dessert tastes like, then I'll probably never eat it again. The pear walnut tart tastes too sugary. The tart was placed over dashes of chocolate and cherry syrup on a plate, like what you see in fancy restaurants. I have a tongue that favors natural tastes and refuses refined sugary food. I didn't like the tart. The coffee was obviously been out for a while, not fresh, not hot.</review>

Nice french restaurant in this chic Laguna beach area.
There is a bakery up front and seating inside as well as on the patio.
I recommend the patio seating for some amazing views of the ocean!
The food was pretty good, the service was good - the dessert was absolutely divine. Especially the macaroons.<//Review>

DO NOT GO HERE. HORRIBLE SERVICE. NOT COVID SAFE. I came here 12/20/20 at around 4pm and ordered a takeout order and the manager took my order. The server still brought my order on open plates without a mask on. I asked politely asked if they could redo the order as takeout instead and the manager refused. His attitude was immature and disgusting! He made a scene in front of everyone and staff!! He told me that I could either accept the order on the disgusting plates that were served without a mask and NOT covid safe or not be served at all. I told him how my family had driven almost 2 hours just to come here and he was so RUDE. I asked if they could at least make the rest of the order that was not brought out yet to go and he said that I had to accept the WHOLE order or not be served at all. I basically had to runafter him to ask for a refund after paying almost 100 dollars for an order I was not getting. He avoided me and pretended to he serving other customers and made me wait in line AGAIN to ask for a refund. We had come here to celebrate my birthday and this really ruined the whole day. It was a horrible experience and I will NEVER come here again or recommend this place to anyone!<//review>

Wonderful dinner - the highlight meal of our week in Cali.  I totally enjoyed the Cajun Linguini dish (flavorful!) and my wife loved her seafood fettuccini (very fresh!). Waiter Ali was as fantastic as the sunset we watched as we sat outside looking over the beach. A+</review>

It sits very close to the sidewalk of the beach with good views at the patio back there. While the breeze from the seashore came to air massage , we enjoyed our little dessert time  with the Italian iced coffee and yammy taste of tiramisu cake (solid and modest sweet).
A bit of high roller bill next to the beach, of course, at least we felt welcome and easy going from the young gentleman host with his good attention and service.</Review>

Food was good. The reason for the one star is I got home and noticed they added their own tip. Be careful when eating her and check your bank. Apparently they believe in adding their own tip. Strongly disappointed and definitely won’t be returning<//Review>

< Review>
Had dinner at C’est La Vie on Friday September 18 and was extremely disappointed. We started with the stuffed mushrooms that were cold and unappetizing. Next the French Onion soup, when delivered the cheese had harden on top and the soup was lukewarm. The crepe was as thick as a pancake and the seafood in the crepe was sparse. The only good thing about the meal was the scenery. Watching the sunset was the highlight of the meal. Since we did not eat any of the mushrooms and very little of our meal we purchased delicious macaroons on our way out. So go to C’est La Vie to watch the sunset and the macaroons.<//Review>

Impromptu dinner as it was we were pleasantly surprised with the excellent food.
Ordered the loup la mer on a lark which we knew after the fact is one of their popular dish.
Topper off with their decadent desserts and now I have one of my fave places to dine in Laguna. The patio view is one of the best to my opinion.<//text>

Complimentary mimosa/champagne when you order Sunday brunch. Great French ambiance with a view of the ocean.
Free parking behind the restaurant!!!

Highly recommend the French onion soup.</Text>

Wasn’t crowded at all on a Sunday night, and the service was quick. They have awesome dinner specials between 4 and 6 PM. We ordered the salmon sauvage and it was tasty. Salmon was so tender and the sauce was excellent. The veggies could have been more tender. Complimentary French bread before the meal was good, and they gave us more than enough for two.

We also ordered their chocolate bomb dessert to go- so good! Chocolate mouse filling inside a chocolate shell. The whipped cream on top was too hardened, so we ended up scraping it off. We would come back here again.< /text></record>

<review>It could be that they are having a hard time with the outdoor only situation but this place is terrible...

There were only about 25 customers total (vs probably 100 capacity in normal times).
It took 30 minutes to get served: fish tacos and a burger...
Glasses were not clean, theY smelled previous guests drinks (Sprite/ Coke)
Fish taste was awful
Burger was very average
French fries were almost raw

Oh and what is French in this restaurant ? They advertise crepes and quiches. Nowhere to be found.

I hate to say this because I know times are rough for businesses but if you care about food quality then avoid this place.</review>< Pictures>

Great place for breakfast. I go here all the time. Manny is our favorite server. Always quick and on point with recommendations. It's small for outside seating,  so keep that in mind.<//text>

Dinner on the back patio overlooking the beach, food (dinner and dessert) was great. Not enough help that night, slow on service but happy to be fed. This place before covid was always good. It may have jyst been a staffing problem that night.</Text>

We came as a group and, given the French theme, I had little expectations for a vegan menu. I planned on grabbing a drink and perhaps a salad; they offered a large plate of sauteed seasonal vegetables which were done beautifully. The rest of the group was more than happy with the menu selection and the varieties of pastries offered from the in-house bakery.  The deck overlooking the water is one of the best in the area. This is a great place for a birthday or celebration and it lacks the pretentiousness that would normally be associated with a restaurant with a location. The owner is very personable and involved. Faredeh checked in often to see if everything was OK (given the search for vegan options). She was awesome!  I'll certainly be back< /Text><Rate>5<//Rate></record></dataset><record>

Mediocre food, fries were cold, spinach was undercooked and the tuna in the salad Nicoise was of an interesting cut. Onion soup had a strong tomato flavor (I’m sure they used tomato paste to help quicken prep). The bread was good.< /review>

< Review>
Awesome location with a nice 2nd floor patio overlooking the beach.  All of the servers were very friendly however the food was only average.  We had crepes, French toast, and a chorizo burrito. Not bad just nothing special. In fairness we did try the bakery or desert items which looked amazing.< /Review>

Really a treasure. We come here every month or so, travelling from Riverside just for the great food and view of the ocean and classic Laguna Beach lifeguard tower from the terrace.</Text>

Tried it out since I had a coupon and it was on our vacation route. Kind of place you might overlook as it was in the middle of block of small shops on a busy street.  Definitely recommend, especially if you're getting tired of the same old menus! Crepes and quiche were our choices, although they did offer the normal burgers, sandwiches, and salads.  Desert is a must, but we took ours to go, as we were already full.  Extraordinary selection of tarts, macaroons, pudding bars, carrot cake, you might just want to stop for one of them and a good cup of coffee or ice tea.<//text>

Their 4 to 6 pm menu special has a nice variety to choose from. I had the 6 oz filet mignon, served on roasted potatoes and asparagus with a cabernet demi sauce. It was wonderful! The view of Laguna's main beach from the upstairs patio was lovely. Decided to splurge and shared a warm, delicious peach tart with my husband. It had a side of the best vanilla bean ice cream I've had in ages. I'd go back in a heartbeat.< /Review>

This is one of my top favorite spots in Laguna Beach.  They are a bit understated it seems as they have a LOT to offer. The food is excellent, perfectly prepared. The deserts are wonderful,  large portions, and MANY choices. Large dining area as well as a bar and a patio. Get the Filet with Blue Cheese crumbles and Cab reduction sauce!<//Text>

This is one of my top favorite spots in Laguna Beach.  They are a bit understated it seems as they have a LOT to offer. The food is excellent, perfectly prepared. The deserts are wonderful,  large portions, and MANY choices. Large dining area as well as a bar and a patio. Get the Filet with Blue Cheese crumbles and Cab reduction sauce!<//Text>

It seemed that the staff was a bit over-worked or something, though, because we waited a very long time for our food on a Thursday night, and we had to ask for things like tea or dessert multiple times before we got them. Aside from the delays, we had a wonderful time with a beautiful view and great food.<//Review>< Pics>

As French food lovers, my husband an I almost never avoid an opportunity to try a new place in town. I had a great salmon dish with my man the other day and my husband had lobster and a soup. Great service, great coffee and a fresh menu with daily eats price point. We'll definitely be back when in the area.<//text>

The food was great. Highly recommend the Seafood fetuccine.... They were the best.
Dessert menu was great too.  Lot is options, and you can pick the menu from s tray they bring to your table!!!  It's such a difference to be tempted with them rather than reading from the menu :)< /Review>

When I think of breakfast or brunch in Laguna Beach, I think of C'est La Vie.  The staff is great, and the food is too!  Earth cafe is too trendy, with long wait times for so-so food.  Try C'est La Vie.  You won't regret it!<//text>

Excellent food, lovely location with beach view both from inside and patio. Friendly and efficient service. Reasonable prices, good portions. Excellent omelette, pancakes, Monte Cristo, and tasty fresh bread. On Sundays, they offer a free mimosa with brunch items. The only downside is finding parking. Will definitely return.<//Review>

The food was good but our server was lazy. We saw him doing nothing... just asking other people to do stuff for him. It was annoying to watch and it was disappointing cause it was Christmas Eve. I had constantly to ask him to come if we needed something. It would be less stars but it would be unfair since the food was good and the service 2 stars.<//Review>

This place is definitely a disappointment. Besides the nice server who said has been working for only 4days, everything else was awful. Bread pudding was like a brick on a plate(a cold brick) crepe was so bad you’d gag. Omelet was mediocre. So basically Gordon Ramsay would’ve yelled at the owner and made the restaurant shut down it’s doors for good!!!!oh btw we were there celebrating a birthday!< /Review>

<text>The view was awesome! I enjoyed sipping on a latte on the balcony while waiting for our food. The espresso is Lavazza which was very good! They also had milk alternatives. The milk froth was not spectacular but it was acceptable.

As far the food goes it was alright. Nothing out of this world but not bad. We both had omelettes. The bakery items looked great but we were too full to try them.

What is worth raving about is the service! We went in at around 11am on a Wednesday and were served right away. Our server was Justin. He was super friendly and made us feel like a local.

We would go back for the views and the great service.</text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Overpriced and not fresh, they give us a cheesecake from the tray not from the fridge. Also very slow and unorganized. The terrace is nice and the cakes looks great, it is a nice tourist trap.< /Review>

The view from the upstairs terrace here is magnificent. If you're looking for a nice place to have lunch and see the ocean on a pretty day, it's hard to beat. My seafood quiche wasn't quite as spectacular as the veiw. The crust was overcooked and tough, and the filling, although pretty good, wasn't particularly flavorful. The salad that came with it was very nice, but quite dry, to the point where I needed to request extra dressing. It's hard for me to say how much of this was due to the particular day that I went there vs how much is just the way the restaurant chefs prepare the food. I would definitely give this place another go!<//text>

Finally managed to stop someone and ask if I could seat myself, answer: "I don't know. Do you see a table available?" I did indeed and sat down. Took 10min to waive a waiter down, another 15 until we could order. We stuck it out hoping it would be legitimately good French food. But we were wrong! Some weird American-PseudoFrench fusion, neither here nor there. On top of that overpriced - most likely due to the view and location, which is actually great.< /text>< Pictures>

<review>So sorry, but the breakfast here was horrible.  From the runny, almost raw eggs (I ordered over medium) to the breakfast potatoes (they simply slice them into full size medallions and throw them in the deep fryer) that tasted like the oil hadn’t been changed in months, and there was “other” food flavor in the grease as well.  My wife’s omelette was over cooked and rubbery she said.  Oh, and here’s a tip to the “cooks” in the kitchen, people REALLY like small, chopped up ingredients in their omelettes, not giant pieces.  Is it really that hard to find a good breakfast restaurant in Laguna Beach???  Sadly, we will not be back :(<//review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

<review>Location is awesome. Staff not too friendly, food wasn’t anything special (I had the eggs Benedict). I liked the coffee, though. Prices a bit too high for the amount and quality of food. The pastries looked very nice (I didn’t try one but would if I went again).<//review>< Pics>

The view is gorgeous! Also, the bakery goods are so delicious and always fresh. There’s many options to indulge your sweet tooth! Anybody can find something here to love! If you are in the Laguna Beach area you must stop by and try this place!< /review>

<Rating>2<//Rating><review>Not typical for me to post a moderate review... without a doubt the best this restaurant has going is it's beach front location...just beautiful...food was average (again, I'm easily pleased), and service was poor...
Given Laguna Beach, prices reflected that (pricy for lunch anyway (e.g. $22 for a turkey and avocado sandwich)) but still not a connect with the poor quality food and poor service).
Just trying to be honest for future tourists trying to save a few vacation dollars...</review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

Had a scrumptious strawberry tart pastry (the crust was like something you dream about) and a large latte...
C'est parfait! Great views from their location by Main Beach.  I would definitely try the Happy Hour specials next time. Of course the Real Housewives of Orange County film here...it's just so French!<//Review>

This place has a French themed but you can order from a variety on the menu. The atmosphere is comfortable and inviting to start; add Faredeh to the mix and you will feel right at home. This sort of personal involvement and care from the owner is rare in the restaurant experience these days! If you are a fan of French Bakeries, be prepared. you are greeted with some amazing pastries the moment you walk in. Just beyond that is the dining area with some great window seating for some world class people watching. There is a small and intimate bar reminiscent of an old world experience. If you are looking for a view, the deck overlooking the ocean is a highlight worth the trip in itself.  Wine selection is decent and their prices are very reasonable given the setting. This is a great place to start a day or wind down in the evening. The central location is perfect for either a beach day or a day exploring the shops and studios. TIP: There are a few parking spaces out back if you are fortunate enough to get one while it's empty</text>

Atmosphere was nice and quaint. Tried the special,  Lobster Eggs Benedict, but was more interested in the cheese and fruit platter. The special had a good portion size. Waiter was nice and informative,  but disorganized with seating.<//Review>

<text>Omg where should I start.... my last night in Laguna my husband and I decided to go here for dinner. We sat at our dirty table for 10 minutes until someone came out of no where with water. After waiting an additional 10 minutes  and wiping the table clean a server came and we specifically ordered the special which was $21.99 for lobster tail and $16.95 for the pork chop. My drink (frozen margarita) was watered down so I asked would they make it over but on the rocks. Not only did they try to charge me for 2 drinks they charged us regular price for the food. We ask them to please change the ticket and they did. After paying and no tip I asked  the manager could I purchase more deserts he said sure to purchase them from the pastry area.... the waiter comes up and asked me why didn’t he get a tip I ask for the manager and he was so rude.... and there was this other idiot trying to gang up on us saying little stupid stuff all the while the waiter is smiling.... I see why this place was empty the entire time I was in Laguna beach. Visit this place at your own risk! And the reason we didn’t tip is because it took them 10 minutes to serve us they stood around talking.... unacceptable< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<review>We sat down by a table, because the sign said seat yourself, then no one came to take our order cause apparently we sat by “ waiting tables” ( there were menus and bottles of water) After figuring out how we can get served and moving to an actual table, we got very dry pastries that each costed $12. Complete lack of management and quality control.</review>< pictures>

Beautiful outdoor patio overlooking the ocean. Unfortunately the food was meh. My entree came out cold; both times. I couldn't be bothered to send it back a 2nd time. My husband's also came out at room temperature...not even warm. Way too pricey of a breakfast for sub par food.<//Review>

<review>Terrible, nasty , unprofessional place everything was dirty had to clean our own table. Waited too long for just four people in their dining second sign that we should have left. Extremely poor management making their employees beg and cry for more tip even chase after you once you’ve left. Confronted manger which clearly doesn’t understand customer service gave him a few lessons then decided to walk away from the conversation. Terrible location you want good service don’t spend your hard earned money here. No wonder this place never has customers.<//review><rate>1< /rate></record>

<text>Way below par, tough porkchop (sent back) reordered Filet Minjon med/rare was very tender & tasty yet not impressed it like the porkchop was served on a bed of mushy sliced potatoes & very under grilled grn beans and asparagus sides like fastfood.
Place does have beauty ,charm & excellent service.</text><user_name>Jared Hill</user_name></record>

I've visited this restaurant since the late 1980's, about 30 years.
Since I live in the San Gabriel Valley, I usually go every few months or years.
The dishes that I have ordered have been good or excellent, 4 to 5 stars.  The service used to be very good, but now it is lacking.
That is why I rated it 3 stars.

I went on 11/10/18.  There is a sign which says to seat yourself.
I sat on the patio and picked up a menu that was already on the table.  Someone greeted me at the table and said that he would send a waiter. I was waiting for quite a while (didn't time it, but too long).  I noticed a couple arrived, sat down, and a waiter immediately went to their table and took their order.  He was tall, had an accent and was left-handed, which I noticed because I'm also a lefty.  I say this so that perhaps a manager reading this will identify him and speak to him in order to improve.
I almost walked out, but another waiter came to serve me.  Perhaps because I was alone, they thought I wasn't as important to serve.  A couple of years ago, I also received inferior service to those around me, I feel because I was alone.  This wasn't the case many years ago.

As far as the food, the Sea Bass with chipotle sauce that I had  was excellent.  However, to make the experience enjoyable, as it should be,
the service needs major improvement.
Other reviewers have stated this need just recently on Trip Advisor, etc.
The management should take note and make improvements.<//Review>

One of the managers, Ferry or something like that, can't stop touching her face and nose and then touching the plates and catchup/hot sauce bottles. Very unhygienic. Though we enjoyed the restaurant, her touching the plates and general unfriendly attitude took away from the experience.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x80dce5b549b136b5:0xf8e0c73b80b29a02< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Good food, great view of the Pacific.  Good coffee and good service. The prices of their croissants are very high. I purchased 2 croissants and they changed me $10. The croissants are very soft , not crispy at all.<//Text>

This French Reastaurnt is located in the center of Laguna beach. The  food is excellent. Most of the customer  love to be seated by the patio. You can enjoyed the view of the beach. soft breeze.. They also have Sunset Dinner Specials from 4 - 6pm. Very romantic.<//Text>

We walked in by chance after finding a parking spot in front of their shop. Went in for a drink and was met with a VERY knowledgeable & capable bar tender named Steven! Over the next few hours we ate some of the tastiest garlic bread and down right delectable mixed drinks! Steven knows his trade well! We enjoyed our visit and atmosphere so much we went back the next night. We were again greeted by kind staff and had the lobster bisque soup among other appetizers. FABULOUS! VERY positive experience here!!< /Review>

Another waiter walked by and I asked.
He kept walking as well. I got up and he turned and told me that they’ll bring us menu as soon as they can.
They were rude and disrespectful. We just got up and had breakfast at Moulin. Much better choice, and actually French.</review>< pics>

It had a tasty but not Nicoise dressing among other faux pas. Fresh tuna was nicely seared but coated with some awful seasoning. Mojito had plenty of mint but NO rum!

Burger came in toast bread, and peach tart was dense, dry, and all the possible opposite pronouns of what a custard should taste like. Even the coffee we ordered was cold.

I’ve eaten here twice. Once, just for coffee and dessert. Another time for lunch.
The location and patio view would get it 5+ stars.
The food is good/ok. Both times service was very good. I would come back here again.<//review>

A taste of Paris. Overpriced food, terrible service! Ordered 5 items - 4 were wrong. The taste of the food, when it eventually arrived, was fine. Clearly catered for tourists that don’t care.</Text>

OK food, good service beautiful view.
Tim/ James was awesome. The mimosa was better than bloody Mary. We've had several variations of egg Benedict, they were all just average. Pastries were fresh.
If I go back, I'd ask for my potatoes to be crispy</review>

<review>Love this place! Tim was hands down the best server we have had in a long time. Very attentive. I loved his recommendation of the crepes and quiches. Something that is very hard to find elsewhere. And the chocolate bomb....to die for! We will definitely be returning.<//review><Date>1462848189018</Date>< GmapID>

I was very impressed with C'est La Vie. The restaurant is very charming with the upstairs outside patio and view of the ocean.  We arrived just in time for happy hour.  Service was great. The bartender/waiter Tony was very pleasant, friendly and knowledgeable about wines.  We had a great time and looking forward to coming back soon.<//Review>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><review>First impression was a very cute and aesthetically pleasing atmosphere. But the hostess and the busser were arguing about where my boyfriend and I should be seated. They were both telling us to sit at different tables.

The food wasn't absolutely terrible. I'm sure the crepes are good. But I didn't get a crepe. I ordered an omelette. It was supposed to be a southwestern-style spicy omelette, but what they brought me was the avocado and bacon omelette. Which I didn't really complain about because I was actually considering ordering that one, but it was very undercooked and watery inside. It was pretty gross. It was also confusing because two different people came to take our order at different times. The iced mocha was okay, but a little chalky.

What I did love was the violin guy walking around the dining room. He stopped at our table and played for a long time. Which was sweet and kinda romantic-y, but I guess we just weren't really sure how to act (should we just watch him play and smile, continue talking to each other, etc.) or if it was appropriate to tip him.

Overall it was a bit of a disappoinment and we felt a little like we had wasted our time and money 🙁 It probably could have been better, but that wasn't our experience.< /review>< GmapID>

French type menu with good crepes, both savory and sweet. Salade Nicoise was good but obviously made by someone who might not have ever had one. It had a tasty but not Nicoise dressing among other faux pas. Fresh tuna was nicely seared but coated with some awful seasoning. Mojito had plenty of mint but NO rum! Service was good and ocean/beach views were pleasant.<//Text>

<Review>I was visiting my friend in Alico Viejo.  Yesterday, April 16, we went to this restaurant that she liked before.    Place is nice, bakery look wonderful.  I am vegetarian and new that French restaurants are not really vegetarian friendly.  but place looked nice and we decided to give it a shot.  In a FEW minutes waiter approached us and before we looked at food menu I asked about sweets, in case we like it and have something with wine instead of meal.  he quickly brought us sample tray, which looked amazing, but unfortunately most of the dessert had jello glazing on it and we said its OK we do not want it.  HE Disappeared  for at least 7 minutes.  we started looked around and waived for attention, when other person noticed that and asked our waiter if those ladies are needing an attention. "no, - he said - they asked for more time".  WE NEVER DID.  He got back to our table.  we asked for a salad and wine.  He DISAPPEARED for another 8 minutes, NO WINE, NO WATER FOR MORE THAN 15 MINUTES OF WAITING.  WE ARE RUSSIAN AND SPEAK WITH ACCENT.  IS THAT WHAT HE DID NOT LIKE?  WE LEFT.
THE ONLY THING I REGRET THAT I DID NOT GIVE HIM A TIP FOR HIS SERVICE: A PENNY THAT HE DESERVES.
I am not going to blame everybody in this restaurant, but one stinking rut that walls into honey barrel spoils it all.
I have plans to move to this area and hope this place will have friendlier attitude</Review>< pictures>

(A Year Later, also a Thursday: Awful service, food is below average. Our waiter Darrick, seemed like he was taking amphetamines. He kept forgetting things and dropping things. Not good.)

Thursday evening.. Excellent service from Tony. Very good food. Patio with ocean view out back. Go for the French wines. This is a local gem and a standard to measure the nearby restaurants by.< /Review>

I visited this place for take out on 14th July 2019. There were only two people in front of me, but it took over 10 minutes to get served. But, to be fair, the guy was on his own most of that time and one of the customers was a pain.

I thought $17.50 for two chocolate croissants and two cronuts was a bit expensive.  However, they were tasty and I've wanted to try a cronut for a long time.<//review>

I love Laguna Beach and all the fun places to eat, but this is one stop I suggest you walk past.
The food is mediocre. Most of it was either pre-made earlier that day or was once frozen or canned. Nothing seemed fresh, and the prices are ridiculous considering what you get. I expected way more from a place that charged $18 for a burger and toted themselves as a "French Bistro".

Even their desserts were brought in from somewhere else.

The only thing that saved them a star was the super friendly hostess, or possible manager, who was super friendly. You could tell she had a lot going on and she was a total rockstar running the restaurant side and jumping to the "bakery" side helping out where she could.< /text>

My husband and I went there for breakfast on Sunday 5/29/16. My husband ordered scrambled eggs with smoked salmon, and I ordered crepe with scrambled eggs then we had cronuts for dessert. Everything was delicious and amazing. We loved the food, the seating and the service. People were nice and courteous even though it was busy. I asked for hot milk instead of half and half and the waiter brought it in minutes. Only thing I noticed they forgot to bring the bread in the beginning and the waiter apologized and brought it with the food.<//Text>

All the food was served cold, including my coffee (Cafe au Lait), in which I waited for hot milk which was served 10 mins later than the coffee- obviously the coffee got cold. It was the fourth of July but none of the other waiters seemed to have an issue, ours was MIA from the start- two other tables sat down after us and got waited on AND served first. Generally unacceptable for anywhere trying to convey an even slightly professional/upscale environment. Would not recommend to anyone.<//Text>

<text>It's a nice place for breakfast.  Nice view of the ocean from the patio seating.  The coffee is very good, which is very important for a breakfast place. They just have to do a better job on their croissants. It is a French cafe with croissants similar to a market packaged soft croissants. I suggest the owners try croissants at an Erewhon  market. Overall a good place to go. I go there often.< /text>< Name>

< Review>
my mother and I were looking for a place to eat that was by the ocean, and we figured that this place would be perfect! French cuisine, right by the ocean, what could be better? Wrong. Although the view was nice and the staff was competent, the food was terrible! Greasy, bland, and entirely underwhelming. I got the ratatouille crepe, and it was practically a plate of oil and some vegetables. This restaurant has an incredible location, wish they could step up their "French cuisine."</Review>

We had a credit voucher to use at this restaurant so we have it a shot one evening. The view from the upstairs patio is great, especially at sunset. Sadly that was best part of the evening. The food was good, however it was not great. And our server was slow. Three other tables were seated after we arrived and left before we had received our check. The staff is really friendly though, so if you are not in any rush, it could be ok. The deciding factor for us not to return was the price of the desserts. The macaroons are $2.45 each. Our desserts, chocolate cheesecake and a tiramisu we just under $12 each. Again, both were good, but not rave worthy.</Review>

Lovely atmosphere to this French restaurant.  Outdoor seating with heat lamps warmed the cool desert evening  for a fantastic dining experience watching the sunset.  The crab stuffed mushrooms were a savory delight.

The waiter's service was excellent.</Review>

<Text>Many years back, my mom and I ate here on the fly--it was fabulous. The service was lovely and so was the coffee. A few years later I remembered this place when a friend of mine was getting married on the beach The manager was SO accommodating--she allowed me to come in  prior to the ceremony and reserve a long table with an amazing view. I brought in fresh flowers and place settings for each seat to surprise the couple and a small group of guests for their post ceremony dinner here. The manager was amazingly sweet and helpful, and from what I hear, the meal was superb. I never got to go back in and say thank you; I have since moved out of state. I will make it a point to eat here on my next visit to Laguna.</Text>< userid>

Overall, I have to tip my hat to C'est la Vie for putting on one stellar dining experience especially for my awesome friend's birthday.  From start to finish, they were on point from the get go.  The service was outstanding, the ambiance and décor was lovely.  The dishes were all incredible with everything tasting amazing.  It exceeded my expectations for sure.  100/10 says I will return.  Definitely worth the money!!  Make a reservation asap!!<//Text>

I really enjoyed my dish of the pasta mamma. I thought it was light yet hearty in a delicious, satisfying way. There wasn't too much Alfredo sauce, there was the perfect amount of eggs, bacon and the tomatoes on top sealed the deal. Absolutely delicious.

I tried the banana foster crepe which was sweet and satisfying as well. The view if you choose outside seating is gorgeous and I enjoyed eying their decor.

What brought down the rating for this place was the waiter. I'd hate to put so much emphasis on the staff, because we're there to eat. However, I feel that waiters/waitresses/ hostesses do make a difference. In this case, it was our waiter. The host who helped us to our table was very sweet and polite upon arriving and departing.

For starters, the waiter did not supply us with any bread. Everyone around us received it, except us until we asked for it. He took our order, then later returned with our food. Now we were celebrating my friends birthday, who specifically told us we had to try her sweet potato fries when they arrived. She told us before she even ordered it, as she was the only one who had been to this establishment before. The waiter then appeared with the food and asked if everything looked okay. The birthday girl mentioned she had ordered sweet potato fries, not the fries she was given. He immediately got defensive and said "you said steak fries." She said okay it's alright I will eat them. He then asked if she would like potato fries and she said no thank you. She was clearly upset. He said "are you sure?" as if he was annoyed. I jumped in and said yes, she would like her sweet potato fries.

This in my opinion was unacceptable. This could've been easily labeled as a miscommunication and resolved. First, apologize to the customer and then politely inform them you will correct the order and bring them out as soon as possible. It's really not that hard. He was just a bad waiter over all and really brought down the mood.< /Text>

Two good dishes on a Sunday diner.  But big mistake was NOT asking about specials.  Table over order what looked to be massive bone on rib-eye steaks.  Very jealous.  Next trip for sure to order.  My salmon grill was excellent.  Wifes dish was average - was to be spicy but really nothing and I believe they had wrong sort of sausage in the dish - polish vs italian which would have been better (garlic in polish overshadowed dish, whereas a chili-based italian would have sparked it -- IMHO).  Good overall.  BTW, servered hers dish on a large plate which should have been a bowl to keep temp up - front line should have caught mis-plating.  Oh well not Michelin star'd .<//review>

<Review>The eggs florentine are their best dish, wont vouge for anything else. I first ate here 14 years ago, the eggs florentine were really good, then for a while they were average. Last time I ate there a month ago they were the best ever! Cheers to the new chef. Service is sometimes slow, the views are amazing.  They're busy usually, it's in a prime location. Coffee is good too. They're nice people here.</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< time>

< Review>
Food is over priced and not good at all.they brought everyone free bread but not us. The caprese crepe was cold and gross. The chicken Brie sandwich was a joke. And the sausage crepe was cold like come on crepes are supposed to be warm. And 5 dollars for a tea bag? Only thing I like was the view...< /Review>

<review>Terrible experience. The meal took 25 minute from ordering time. They brought the wrong entree and it was grossly over cooked. The waiter told me that a large crow had come in after us and they had first priority. On exit, the manager  made a similar excuse. Terrible.< /review><UserId.>105955932363804239565<//UserId.><username>Michael MacKrell<//username><pictures>None<//pictures></record></dataset><record>

We complained about the food and the manager under his breath said I hope you choke on it. I have let everyone know in Laguna Beach about these con-artists who can not even cook. So so ill the next day all of our party were really sick with Staph poisoning and my daughter was one week in hospital vomiting her guts out. This is not in the least bit French. Our food was cold and microwaved prepackaged food made to look fancy. The taste was revolting. The management are not even French but Iranian Arabs.< /Review>< Response>

<Review>Absolutely one of Lagunas most beautiful dining experiences. I love the crepes when they are available. The only reason I went 4 instead of 5 stars is I have been there when they were busy and my meal was served cool. I will conclude that when they are on point the items I tried were remarkable.< /Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
I don't usually do restaurant reviews, but this place was truly terrible!!!! My friend and I were looking for a place to relax and to study. It was empty, and the busboy (who was very nice) told us we were welcome to have a cup of coffee and study since the restaurant was empty. The waiter, however, was very rude and made us feel extremely uncomfortable; he constantly tried to push us to buy more food and to buy alcoholic drinks, and then made snide remarks under his breath about us being cheap when we said no thank you. The food was terrible!!!! He gave us dry, stale bread, but the busboy was nice enough to get us something a little fresher. The food that we ordered was really salty and not very fresh looking, and the dipping sauces looked gross and smelled funky. Then he charged us $30 for a single appetizer and two coffees. We didn't even get a refill for our coffee because he left for a smoke break and was gone for a while. The menu said that the appetizer was only $10 and that the coffee was $3, but he said that was his "special" rate with a really mean smile. ***It is not worth the nice view to go here; please don't support these people after they bullied and ripped us off***</Review>

<review>We walked in and the place was almost empty (as if a warning sign). I didn't want to eat there, so we just checked out the bakery in front. All the desserts looked so appetizing and delectable, but to my mistake i was completely wrong. We asked the gentleman for the fruit tart and he said he would throw in a "free" slice of the cheesecake with that since we purchased the whole cake. i thought he was so kind for that until he came back with our change. the total turned out to be over $40 and he refused to give us a receipt. when we finally got some kind of slip of paper, he avoided us as we walked out angrily. we knew something sneaky was going on here. when we arrived home, the top layer of the cake was delicious, but once i tasted the bottom crust, it was so stale and just ruined my appetite. the cheesecake, however, was okay. i couldn't believe this had just happened, we got ripped off for a digusting dessert and i will never eat here again. DO NOT EVER WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY HERE!!!< /review>< Rate>

< Review>
Not sure how to feel about this place. Arrived to an early Valentine's day dinner and were offered anywhere to sit by young man at bar. We chose a table with ocean view. We were told to please move to a smaller table adjacent to that table because the table by window was reserved for a larger party. We abided. Service was great by our server. Very attentive. Food was very good. We noticed during our meal, another couple came in and were told the same thing as us....they could sit anywhere they'd like. They looked around, like we did earlier, and chose the exact same table with ocean view. They were escorted to table. They were also a party of 2. They were not told to move (they didn't have reservation). I dont know why we were not allowed to stay at that table and they were. It was our 26th anniversary, chose this place over ALL our choices in Laguna. We chose to eat an early dinner to beat the crowds and maybe get an ocean view. We felt very uncomfortable during our meal because of this. Again, our server was awesome, the cioppino was great and we bought a few desserts at the front little bakery to take home, the young girl helping us was great. We actually ended up eating our cheesecake slice we bought there, instead of waiting till we got back to our hotel. Our server was gracious enough to bring us plates and forks. Just got a feeling we weren't very welcomed there by the way we were treated by that bartender/young man. We tried to still have a romantic dinner. Was a little difficult as we could hear the couple next to us admire the ocean view, that we had, out loud. Would have been a 5 star experience. How does one take that?</Review>

<text>Service was terrible. Chicken sandwich was cheap white bread and a thin layer of chicken breast. Salad came out with no dressing. Just pile of leaves on a plate next to a sub par chicken sandwich. Had to flag down a busboy to get the dressing for my salad. Server made up for it with free dessert, however, dessert was soggy and nasty. Expected A LOT more for the price.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Great view of the ocean from the patio! The food and drinks are on par with the view. Prices are reasonable, too.</review>

I remember coming here a couple years back and really the quality of food and service wasn't the greatest.  I have been hearing good things about the change in management so went here again recently and tried the prime hanger steak paired with it with the red bordeaux (a recommendation from staff) which was awesome!  They have really stepped up their game around here!!!! Now, not only is the venue wonderful but the food and service are on the same playing field.</Text>

the view was marvellous!the service crew are attentive however, the food is disgusting!we ordered burger and fish n chips and the tiny fish was rolled in a greasy crust.the burger looks good but taste bland.the only thing that taste good is their pepsi...the crew always check on you if your food taste good to a point that its annoying coz you dont want to hurt their feelings on the spot.<//Review>

<rating>2</rating><Text>Not sure how to feel about this place. Arrived to an early Valentine's day dinner and were offered anywhere to sit by young man at bar. We chose a table with ocean view. We were told to please move to a smaller table adjacent to that table because the table by window was reserved for a larger party. We abided. Service was great by our server. Very attentive. Food was very good. We noticed during our meal, another couple came in and were told the same thing as us....they could sit anywhere they'd like. They looked around, like we did earlier, and chose the exact same table with ocean view. They were escorted to table. They were also a party of 2. They were not told to move (they didn't have reservation). I dont know why we were not allowed to stay at that table and they were. It was our 26th anniversary, chose this place over ALL our choices in Laguna. We chose to eat an early dinner to beat the crowds and maybe get an ocean view. We felt very uncomfortable during our meal because of this. Again, our server was awesome, the cioppino was great and we bought a few desserts at the front little bakery to take home, the young girl helping us was great. We actually ended up eating our cheesecake slice we bought there, instead of waiting till we got back to our hotel. Our server was gracious enough to bring us plates and forks. Just got a feeling we weren't very welcomed there by the way we were treated by that bartender/young man. We tried to still have a romantic dinner. Was a little difficult as we could hear the couple next to us admire the ocean view, that we had, out loud. Would have been a 5 star experience. How does one take that?<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

I wish I could give them a negative star. We went there with the family on 01/01/2016. Seated almost immediately and decided to leave right after talking to the waiter. I didn't care about his stitches on his eyebrow or banged up face but his attitude and short answers and " I don't wanna be here" attitude was almost as disgusting as the restaurant. On the way out the manager or owner also pushed my daughter out of her way, saying "move"  she is lucky her face didn't end up matching the waiter. Don't waste ur time. Go somewhere else. Hopefully they close down or change management soon.<//text>

<user_id>102681708755399564894</user_id><review>One of my favorite spots for weekend brunch. It has a patio upstairs that overlooks Laguna Beach. The staff are always friendly and helpful. Their bread is delicious. I usually get the huevos rancheros, though it is a lot of food. They also have mojo potatoes with many of their breakfasts, which are yummy.

The bakery is also very good. I have not eaten here for dinner because it is quite expensive, but I imagine it's very good.<//review><Rating>4</Rating><GmapID>0x80dce5b549b136b5:0xf8e0c73b80b29a02<//GmapID><Time>1529442675935</Time><Pictures>None< /Pictures><user_name>Desiré Whitmore<//user_name></record></dataset><record>

They don't open until 9:00, and don't have the day's goods ready until 10:00. What kind of French bakery isn't open by at least 8:00, and has no fresh stuff ready to sell by the time they do open? This place needs to die so a real bakery can serve the good people of Laguna.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>They screwed up our reservations and the service was extremely slow in fact they forgot one of our orders and took an extra 10 to 15 minutes to bring it to us so we were all done eating when the last person got their order. Never checked to see if we wanted refills. Very disappointing for supposedly a high-end restaurant.<//Review><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x80dce5b549b136b5:0xf8e0c73b80b29a02<//Gmap_id>< Rating>

Expenseve rude service, tasteless food. The floors and  menus sticky show that need a good cleaning! The stars are for the amazing view from the patio.</Text>

We only had desserts in the afternoon. The view was good on the beach, and the desserts were relatively good (but not exceptional) however they were really overpriced (12 dollars for a piece of cake). If you do not mind the price the quality and everything might like you.< /Text>

<Text>We had a reservation for 630 and the host told us that the reservations did not matter because they had too many walk ins.. So we waited over and hour to sit down.. Then we waited over an hour at our table and still no server came to us once.. Every table was complaining that their food was cold, dry and chewy and other tables complained that they had not received there food in over 2 hours, so we took the hint and left. This is the first time I have ever felt the need to write a review and I am not that picky. This truly was the worst experience and I would honestly stay away from this restaurant.</Text><UserId.>110716033249423561099</UserId.>< date>

I loved this place!  For the price, it's sooooo much better than many of the restaurants around here.  And the food was amazing!  I had the Sea Bass and Bread Pudding.  Two of my favorites and they both were incredible!  And my server, Brittany, was very kind, extremely knowledgable about the food, and very timely as she checked on me.  (I'll request her again when I eat here.)

And who can beat the view????  I watched the sunset over the ocean.  Oh my goodness!  What an amazing evening.  I'll come here again... hope you'll give it a chance too...<//review>

It was great to have the lunch on the patio, we had a really nice time in this restaurant. I had a great ahi ahi niçoise salad, my wife had the croque monsieur (lots of meat inside, ham or turkey, I don't remember), and my in-laws took the beef filet mignon and fish and chips. All plates were tasty and well prepared.
The raspberry cheesecake was also really good. Espresso was also really good, reminded me the ones I used to have in France.
Also, I thought that the prices were in acceptable range with several plates for less than $20.
The only thing that I did not like was the Walnut tart. I was expecting a crunchier one but had a 'soft' one.< /Review>

Not sure where to start. It seemed like one thing after another went wrong. Food was very disappointing, service was awful. Our waiter was also our bartender, and made the worst margarita I’ve ever had, I think he forgot the sweet and sour or lime, just tasted like ice blended with tequila. Then he made a snide comment when I sent it back. My kids all ordered crepes off of the adult menu, which were ok, not great, but they were supposed to come with a scoop of ice cream, which they didn’t. When I mentioned it to the waiter he said they ran out, and offered a macaroon instead, but first  tried to sneak it by us without our noticing.

Apparently our orders were on separate tickets from my kids’, because after delivering the kids food We could hear the waiter yelling at the chef for not making the rest, and showing him the missing ticket. By the time we got our food, my kids were almost done eating.

My seafood quiche was decent, but not great. My wife had filet mignon crepe, which was good but way too much sauce and the filet was over cooked.

After all this the waiter adds automatic gratuity, and points out that he did us a favor by only doing 18% because the it’s normally 20%. So I look over the handwritten bill, and notice they overcharged each of the crepe dishes by $2 each. He fixed the bill, and gave us a card for $10 off our next visit.....  hahaha. Like that would ever happen.

Oh yeah, and there’s no air conditioning. The day we visited was 100degrees and it was uncomfortably warm inside the entire meal.

If I’m going to spend $191 on lunch, I expect good food, great service, and a comfortable atmosphere. This place had none of the above. Don’t waste your money< /Text>

<Rate>4<//Rate><text>The food at C'est La Vie was very special.. 5 star. I ordered simple, a Tuna Salad sandwich on rye and was I ever surprised. The sandwich was delicious, the bread was fantastic (light and great texture), then they served a pasta salad (which came with it). Best pasta salad I have ever had.

I met and congratulated the cook (Daniel), he happened to come out of the kitchen for a short time. Additionally, the waitstaff was great and the atmosphere is pleasant.

They also have a great patio overlooking Main Beach Park and the ocean. I love this place.

Note: I would give C'est La Vie a 5 star review  except the manager was very rude (before this writing I asked several people about the restaurant and the young manager (35 ish); every single one said he is rude), This manager certainly could work on his friendliness and be more professional with his customers. On the otherhand, the owner is an older man, he and his sister were very nice. Should be 5 Stars for sure!

One star for this restaurant is way to much. Was there for mother's day and the experience was painful. They couldnt even get the quich right. When I call the manager to give my point of view she came up with so many excuses and no apology.
Do not go there!< /Review>

Food is overpriced but other than that is was good. Plus it has a great view. The good thing is that their pastries are on point.</text>

Nice cafe close to the beach. We went there for an iced drink, and it was ok. The prices are a bit high for the quality of the products and the service.<//Review>

We had a reservation for 630 and the host told us that the reservations did not matter because they had too many walk ins.. So we waited over and hour to sit down.. Then we waited over an hour at our table and still no server came to us once.. Every table was complaining that their food was cold, dry and chewy and other tables complained that they had not received there food in over 2 hours, so we took the hint and left. This is the first time I have ever felt the need to write a review and I am not that picky. This truly was the worst experience and I would honestly stay away from this restaurant.<//Review>

< review>
We always enjoy their French Onion Soup and they have some good sandwhiches.  Good views if you want to sit by PCH and people watch or sit ocean side to hear the waves.  At our last visit, the service was not the best, we were constantly looking for our Server to get more coffee, condiments, out bill.  We will give them one more chance before we go somewhere else.  Lots of options on PCH in the area.</review>

<review>We had to get up from our table to get someone to wait on us and to get the check too. Someone told us that our designated waiter had just quit. They took forever to bring my credit card back and a couple of days after that my CC was cloned and used to make purchases at a jewelry store several times within days. If you had your CC cloned after visiting this place let me know.</review><rating>2< /rating><name>Mimi</name></record>

< Review>
My friend and I tried C'est La Vie, yesterday for dinner, using a Travelzoo voucher.  We were not sure what to expect after reading the reviews.  We were very pleasantly surprised.  The manager was very attentive and made sure the server was told about us as soon as we sat down.  He came by several times during the meal to make sure everything was to our liking.

We sat on the covered part of the outside patio.  The forecast had been for rain, but the sun came out.  It was lovely and very comfortable.

Our server was very attentive to us as well as were all the other servers as they walked by---taking empty dishes and filling our water glasses, etc..

The food was delicious!  We had Jumbo Mushrooms with crab for an appetizer.  I had Sea Bass and he had Seafood Fettuccine for the main course.  My friend is from NYC and we have not found any restaurant in OC that he considers as having very good food.  This is the first restaurant that we have found  that he said has very good food!!!

The food is pricey as it is in most French restaurants. Because we were using a Travelzoo voucher, we were very pleased with our experience in every way!</Review>

Horrible service. Rude waiters and bus boys. Avoid this place- they are unwelcoming and shouldn't be in the service business. I'd give them 0 stars if I could.</text>

Divine Pharaoh<//name>
<Time>1478403109443<//Time><Rate>5</Rate><Review>Some people meet God standing atop the Grand Canyon; some on the battlefield. I can say that divine intervention appeared before me when glorious beef bourguignon from the Friday french night menu, prepared in an entirely new way (to me), at my command, paired with a deliciously-bodied EnRoute Far Niente.

Prime steak and chops night. Fearsome words only rivaled by "ecstasy" and "heaven" - these are the descriptive modifiers that transformed my evening from the mundane to.... a trip to C'est la Vie.

From perfected dishes presented in front and a wise sommelier filling my glass from behind, I was regaled with tales of truth, and, (I hope) fantastical myth describing the origins of my meal.

Excellence was demonstrated in my presence and I couldn't be more satiated, body and soul.</Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
Great location, beautiful ocean views right on the Main Beach in Laguna. Breakfast was excellent, pancakes, eggs benedict all cooked to perfection. Potatoes were golden and crispy. Wonderfully fresh French bread on the side! Even the huevos rancheros were good for a French restaurant, served on a quesadilla base. Service a tad slow but friendly. Now to try some delicious macaroons and Cronuts from the bakery on the way out!< /Review>

Come for the seating next to beach, but don't come for the food. Took my wife here for her birthday and we were expecting French cuisine. The menu is French enough having many of the traditional items. I ordered a Ahi Tartarte for appetizer and it was underwhelming both in looks and taste, not to mention the brown, spotted avocados.

For our entree, wife had the Canard A L'Orange and I had the Entrecote with the ubiquitous peppercorn creme sauce. The duck was soggy and overcooked, tasted like day(s) old food. My ribeye was a fat, sloppy cut, a bit undercooked, but the sauce was a sweet, tangy mess with no peppercorns anywhere. It felt like the chef cooks whatever/however he wanted and haven't read the menu. We were so disappointed with the food we didn't even finish it and decided to pay and leave.

The service was decent enough, but will not be coming back nor recommend any friends to come.</Review>

< Review>
My wife and I ate dinner at C'est La Vie on Monday February 8, 2010.  The meal was excellent, reasonably priced and complimented by courteous staff and our waitress was extremely attentive and friendly.

We had walked down from our hotel (which had recommended the restaurant), we had the half price bottle of wine with our meal as we understand in California it is OK to Drink and Walk and there was no pressure on us to drink up and leave!

We took dessert back to the hotel with us from their bakery as we were agreeably stuffed!

I had read the mixed reviews before we went and as the negative ones were largely emotional rants and not objectively qualified, both my wife and I are pleased that we ignored them.

It appears the previous reviewer Devo's guest/date/spouse should be pleased if not relieved that they didn't give him a second beer as Valentine's Day is the 14th not the 13th!<//Review>

This is not my first time here, just my first review. Very satisfied with the food, most food on their menu, but service can be slow at times. A place you can't argue with waiting with the view of the ocean and Catalina island.< /text>

(Translated by Google) Kind attention. Off the coast, I ate a cajun jambalaya pasta. It was ok. Very beautiful place.

<time>1566233861166< /time><review>(Translated by Google) That's a real French corner in Laguna Beach. The food was very delicious, served with a big smile and more. The decoration of the place is authentic, which gives the place a special cachet in full tourist place. Prices are very affordable for the city of Laguna Beach. I recommend it deliciously!

(Translated by Google) It is a restaurant of food and sweet French style. The food is good however I did not have a good experience of their customer service. They are slow to leave the table ready, in ordering you and in general I could be more professional in the service since it is of French style they could honor the culture Culinary of that country. Anyway there are beautiful sea views from the terrace where you can eat outdoors in front of the beach. Good luck.

(Original)
Es un restaurante de comida y dulceria estilo francés. La comida es buena sin embargo  no tuve una buena experiencia de su servicio al cliente.Demoran para dejar lista la mesa,en hacerte el pedido y en general podría ser más profesional en el servicio ya q es de estilo francés  podrían hacerle honor a la cultura culinaria de ese pais.De todas maneras hay bellísimas vistas al mar desde la terraza donde se puede comer al aire libre frente a la playa. Buena suerte.<//Text>
