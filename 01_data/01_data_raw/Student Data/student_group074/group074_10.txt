Tasty pies-- it smells great as soon as you walk in!

More of a flaky crust, with a delicious amount of apple inside. Not exactly the top pie I've seen, but so close it almost doesn't matter.</Text>

Was a little shocked to pay $10 for a single serving of pie, but then I took a bite.

The staff was very friendly and helpful. The store itself is clean, organized and professional looking. The pie came in a very cute personal box that made it very easy to eat. I live in Anaheim, but will be stopping by this shop the next time I am in the area.< /text>

Four stars for the food and another star for the aesthetic. The pies are definitely a little pricey, but it was still a nice dessert to have. Unless you eat a lot, I would say that the portions they recommend are a little too big.< /text>

As somewhat of a pie snob, I can honestly say that I've never had better pie anywhere. Period. Quality of ingredients is paramount and it is very obvious that the fruit pies are made in house with fresh fruit. The crusts are flaky and perfect and paired with each pie exquisitely (check out the salty oatmeal crust on the Chocolate Cowgirl!). Their coffee is also pretty good and they've got WiFi to boot so go try a couple slices as you sip on a latte and work on a laptop. My only fault with this place is that I can't plug in my ancient laptop because they don't have any outlets. Fix this and I'll find a way to leave a 6-star review.<//Text><Rate>5</Rate>< response>

So when a new shop called Winston Pies opened up in my neighborhood, it piqued my interest. I stopped by once it opened in Brentwood and I’ve been coming to Winston Pies ever since. I absolutely adore this place. The pies are incredible, the people here are friendly, the ambiance is nice and everything about this place makes me happy. I’ve been celebrating both the ordinary and extraordinary days with Winston Pies and I don’t think I’ll ever stop. I highly recommend this place. My personal favorites are usually seasonal like the peach bourbon pie, nectarine pie and the cowgirl (it’s a rich chocolate pie). They have great coffee too.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80c2bca0755995dd:0x1934ff53f942e928</gmapID></record>

Ooh pies!

Interestingly saw this place in a Nextdoor thread about "where to get good key lime pies", that someone had posted. I went through all the recommendations, and saved them on Google maps. This was the first one I hit up.

The crust of their pies are just amazing! Reminded me of Kouign Amann. It's crispy and buttery and ooh so yummy!

Also funnily enough, I don't particularly enjoy key lime pie, so got a slice of the chocolate and the cherry pies. And a bite sized apple pie for my walk home.

I highly suggest getting the apple or the cherry one. Chocolate one was very good too, but has gotten less good after some time in the fridge.

Honestly think this might have been the best dessert pie place I've been to. They only make dessert pies, in case it helps.

Will definitely stop by again. But I'm also glad they're far away enough that I won't walk over on a daily.<//Text>

<Review>As someone who owns a pie shop in the south (Nashville, TN), I was a bit hesitant coming to Winston Pies, not knowing what to expect. However, I have raved about the chocolate cowgirl pie non-stop since I had my first bite of one last week. I haven't met a pie anything like my great grandmother's until now... it is heavenly. The oatmeal crust really sets it off!</Review>< user>

The scent upon entering is everything you'd expect at a pie shop. The key lime pie was delicious. The fruit pies are not short on fruit! Best cherry pie I have ever had. So many size options between individual slices to mini pies to hand pies to pie bites to whole pies! Worth stopping by if you have a hankering for pie. Also has free parking in the back!!<//text>

My friend and I stopped by for some dessert after having dinner up the street at Sugarfish. The place was empty when we got there but had a steady flow of people in and out while we enjoyed our pie.

The place offers many different sizes of pies, from tiny pie bites to slices to mini pies and full sized ones. They were all out of the pie bites when we were there so I opted for a slice of pie and my friend got a mini pie. We also each got whipped cream on our pies (an extra 75 cents).

I got the chocolate pie, which was rich but not overly sweet. It had a granola crust which was decent but I would have preferred a graham cracker crust or something similar to that. The pie was creamy and rich and I really enjoyed the chocolate portion of it. My friend got a pumpkin pie and he said that it was good (and he inhaled it in under 2 minutes so it must have been!).

I know this is Brentwood and a super bougie rich area, but this place still seemed overpriced. The slice of pie was $7 and while it was good, it wasn't worth the price point. The mini pie wasn't too much bigger and that was $9. I think if they lowered the cost by $1-2 then I would be in here way more often.

Service was fairly friendly and they certainly had a ton of people working here when we were there. I would say stop by for some dessert if you're in the area and craving something other than ice cream.< /Text>

Absolutely love this place. The pies are amazing. Maybe a little pricey but they are always fresh and delicious. So popular they run out of it at times but they have mini pies and you can buy a slice. The coffee is also great. The place is clean. Bright and just comfy. The sales people are super friendly. Just a very enjoyable trip. Yum!<//Review>

This is a bakery is not really a French patisserie, more like a bake shop with Armenian style sweets and some basic pastries.  I've been here a few times because I like to support local business but the pastries are not very good and the customer service could be so much better.</Text>

<review>I thought the staff was very friendly, the pies were extremely fresh but wow, pricey!

I took a few of their mini pies home -  while fresh, my house guests  simply weren’t wowed. The key lime was particularly disappointing (not as billed, true FL keylime pie) If pricing were average, I think I’d give 4 stars but at premium pricing, I think its reasonable to expect and rank on that level of expectation.

Again, a lot of positives here but as of today, as much as I wanted to, I didn’t find it worth a $48 pie.</review>< pics>

Outstanding pies, 2nd to none! These are the best pies I have ever eaten.  Great: pies, staff and prices. Don't be surprised if you see some of Hollywood stars there also. Don't miss out on these pies, there great.<//Review>

<Text>It's my favorite place for a cup of great coffee and a piece of always amazing pie. Never tried something I didn't love there. And the staff is so friendly and nice that the overall experience is just really a pleasure.<//Text>< Pics>

Made sure to give a decent tip after buying a small key lime pie that had an awesome crust, but was too sweet for my taste.

The baker or owner was unfriendly. Left a bad taste in my mouth and would not go back.<//text>< date>

The hand pies and bites are the perfect size for a dessert. The crust is so beautifully flakey that the filing almost doesn't even matter, but the fillings are good too so it's definitely worth going and giving it a shot</Review>

<review>The pie crusts are buttery and flaky from top to bottom and the fillings are noticeably fresh but not overly sweet. I had blueberry, cherry, and key lime - all were delicious.

They have nice variety of pies available in slices, full pies, pie pockets, and pie bites. The pie bites are a treat!< /review></record>

A homey, comforting Southern filling, with a slightly soft crust that melts in your mouth. With excellent customer service, Winston Pies is an instant winner!<//Review>

Tried this place for the first time today. Got a slice of the chocolate cowgirl and a chai tea latte with almond milk. The pie was good - not amazing -  just a good, solid slice of pie with rich fudge chocolate and salty oatmeal crust. The chai tea latte was overpowering. Much too strong. I had to add vanilla to soften it. Then, it was much better. I will probably try another slice in the future - the twix (yes, twix!) or the key lime pie.< /Review>

I was not impressed with the Apple pie. I had several bites that I had to pull pieces of the Apple core back out. One pie was $48 and I would expect better for that price.< /Text>

Great place, the wait is worth it. Fresh fish, rice on point, my daughter tried her 1st Japanese pop. The lady serving us was awesome and very friendly. Will be coming back.</Review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>Little family owned restaurant treat you like family once you step over the threshold.  There can be a wait, but ordering in advance will help tremendously; especially on busy days like Thursday and Friday night. They are not open weekends and close for a nap and change over to dinner service between 200p - 530p. Food is served in generous portions and individually prepared for excellence.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<user_name>Michael King</user_name><text>This is a great family owned place. Everyone is extremely nice. The prices are very reasonable for the quality. They have a nice bento box combo which is cheap with high quantity and quality. I've had a variety of things from their menu and none of them bad. When it is busy, service can be quite slow, but they try hard and have a good product. Will definitely be on our eat out rotation list!< /text></record>

Can't say enough. Great local restaurant with fantastic food. We had a few of the nicer rolls, and both were phenomenal. We also had the garlic edamame, seaweed salad, and gyoza. On the "would we do it again?" basis, the answer is a resounding "yes"!<//Review>

Great sushi, not just your average spicy tuna roll. We got the Lemon Valerie and Forever Young- some of the best sushi I've had!
On top of that, the staff was super kind and friendly. They have outdoor seating with great ambience:)</Review>

The food is fantastic, made with great care. Part of its charm is that it takes a while to get your dinner ;)  If you can mellow to jazz, sake and sashimi then you will do well to eat here.< /Text>

Love this place the food and service is great! Family owned. Prices are awesome. Really recommend it. If your coming with a big group I suggest you make reservations and maybe the food order ahead of time. Its a small buisness but wouldnt trade it for anything.<//Text>

<Resp>None<//Resp><review>Yireh sushi is the best! We have lived in the neighborhood for awhile now and we were so happy when we found this restaurant. Not only is it the best sushi I have ever had, the Lee's are so friendly and are always happy to see us! They care about their customers and always treat us like family. They even named a roll after my son! Favorites are the jalapeno  bomb appetizer, the Ace roll, Dragon roll, baked salmon roll, Avery roll and the Sebastopol roll. The unagi nagiri is also amazing! Definitely the best sushi in town!<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< gmapID>

<review>Our server was so kind and genuine, at the end of her shift her young son was in a pack on her back! We truely felt like we were part of the family and felt welcomed the whole meal through! The service was maybe a little bit slow technically, but there was only one server and she was absolutely slammed so it was understandable, and her friendlyness made up for it</review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

I had a great first experience at Yireh for lunch the service great and the food was delicious I had chicken teriyaki bento and my friend had udon soup he really enjoyed.  The second visit was for dinner and again great service even though the place was packed and the food was good I ordered the steak teriyaki plate I'm just not sure if it was supposed to be a cold meal or not the plate itself was so ice cold that the steak was cold. Otherwise still enjoyed the visit.<//Review>

Wonderful Place. Maybe not recommendable for Kids, More for sharing with friends or a date, Really quiet and peaceful. The Cons are: The food takes too long  and the place is small.< /Review>

<Time>1430080333294<//Time><rating>5</rating><Review>If you're looking for a local, hard working, family owned, friendly, high quality restaurant for lunch or dinner; with friends or family, to go or dining in on date night, this is your spot.  Located at the intersection of Sebastopol and Fresno right next to the bus stop is Yireh Sushi dishing up delicious america rolls, bargain priced bento boxes, healthy gigantic salads, and fresh nigiri sushi.

Park on Sebastopol Rd. and walk in to grab a table.  There is outdoor seating, perfect for sunny days, but walk in first to grab a menu.

Finally the food:
For those of you who love spicy food i recommend starting with a jalapeno bomb, a spicy sashimi salad, and any of the spicy tuna rolls.

If you prefer sweet foods then they have an awesome honey walnut shrimp termpura, and the fried twinkie is absolutely the perfect way to end a meal.

Perhaps you're looking for something delicious and healthy to get back/stay in awesome shape then i recommended the avocado salad and the fresh nigiri sushi.

Finally for those of you who love the flavors and texture of sushi rolls they have something for everyone, from the always favorite california roll with crab and avocado, to the hot night roll with shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, tempura crunch, and unagi sauce.  There is the Yireh roll with shrimp tempura covered in fresh fish, and the creamy lobster roll.  Their hand rolls are generously packed with fish and the spicy tuna is hands down one of my favorites.

I didn't want to write this review because it's becoming more popular everyday, and just writing this review has made me hungry for their food,  but their wonderful service is something you can't miss.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x8084382a65ed8691:0x26a1ee3467a4d6a5< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

This Arco was just like any other one except for the fact that instead of a mini mart there was a mini gross as a convenient store so do some shopping get some groceries get your gas what a good business plan! 5 out of 5 stars for sure good service too this is< /Review>

Some of the cheapest gas in the area. Close by my motel room so it was easy to gas up. Inside they had all the usual snacks & drinks to be expected. Staff really didn't know other places for the area which i feel like they kinda should.</Text>

<review>Just found out that Uber/Lyft drivers get a small discount (2.77 became 2.75) when you show your driver app (not sure how that proves anything showing the map; I didn't show my acct page). The nose-ringed young lady didn't know if it is all or some or just this Arco. I have never seen the notice banner at other Arcos but I will be sure to look and ask now.

The prices are OK for the area. For the county, I have seen over 10 cents lower in other cities.<//review><Response>None< /Response><date>1502748539030<//date>< Name>

Phil is the only barber who has ever given me a proper undercut. Bless this man. Every other barber I’ve gone to messes it up and goes too high.<//text>

Very uneven cut.
I’ve been around for a while, but never had such a bad haircut.
My head was full of hair clippings and many in my undershirt.
You don’t use vacuuming because “makes too much noise.” But it’s ok all over my shirt.
You never offered a mirror to see by back..
This is a first time.
Sorry Fred. Sweet talker, but I don’t mind the $30  and the $10 I gave you, but I expected much Much better.<//review></record></dataset><record>

My haircut was 35 bucks and it took 10 minutes and it was right up there with some of the most basic haircuts I have ever gotten.  Wanna charge 35.00 for a men’s haircut, you should have the talent to back it up.  Never going back.</Text>

I just moved to PG, and needed a cut, so I came here. My only grumble could be that I had to wait a good while, but that's also proof that the place is popular, and the owner helpfully suggested I go get a coffee after I signed in on the walk-in list. The barbers here are good at their craft, and also seem to really enjoy it. They've done a good job of creating a welcoming and enjoyable place to get a cut. This isn't a quiet, in-n-out place. The staff engages in playful chat, the people walking by on the sidewalk pop their heads in to talk. It's a nice little niche. Ultimately, I got my haircut, my wife likes it, the price was reasonable, and I left feeling happy.< /text>

A great haircut, staff is very friendly, and comes with a massage at the end. My haircut was 30 dollars, but the price is worth it for the service and the atmosphere is very nice. Came back a few months later for a trim, and was only 25$. Elmer cuts my hair, but both are excellent barbers.< /Text>

<review>Best barbershop on the peninsula. Phil gives a great haircut and always makes you feel welcome. I’ve been going here for a little over a year now and I’ve never been disappointed. And the other barbers that work here are also great. Great conversations, great haircut, and a fair price.<//review>< pictures>

I liked the cut I got the first time from Phil.  The second time I went, Sal basically just gave me a 1 buzz, and sent me on my way.
I would go again if it is Phil cutting my hair.< /Review>

Phill's is really grate! Both Phill and Elmer are excellent and experienced barbers. Haircuts are on the pricey side ($30) and you can't make an appointment. Expect to wait 30mins minimum unless you arrive before the shop opens and are 1st or 2nd on the sign-in sheet.< /Review>

Phil and staff very friendly and always ready to engage in conversation. Phil seems to be a bit of an audiophile, and there's always a good selection playing through the speakers. Knowledgeable and confident staff. About what you'll pay at a barber shop; not the cheapest place to get a cut, but definitely not the most expensive.<//Review>

Unfortunately the last few visits have not gone well.  Phils other barbers are absent, apparently they call out frequently for softball tournaments. This leaves Phil alone and the wait time can be hours long.  He has a list so you can come back but it is not convenient every time. Not Phil's fault, his team is letting him and the business down. I went elsewhere this time. I hope Phil can find reliable help.</text>< GmapID>

Gave my regular barber a break and tried Phill's. Had a good experience but my regular barber need not worry that I will switch. Walk in a +. A bit of a wait with 2 of 3 chairs in use. Quick cut and I was on my way.</Review>

Don't let the straight razors and atmosphere fool you. I paid 30 dollars for a cut that looked like a chewed up carpet. There wasn't even an attempt to make it look good with a comb or anything, they sent me out of there looking like I had just taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut my hair off myself.</Review>

Overpriced.  Barber could not follow directions.  Phil made a comment about how my last barber jacked up my hair?  That last barber has been cutting hair for 30 years and can follow directions.  Told Phil's guy specifically - leave the sides longer - I got a high and tight.  Told him to cut a straight line, got a curved line.  Why do so many barbers struggle with following simple directions.  All that for $45...

Additionally Phil is complaining that business is slow during the day, closes promptly at 5pm.  Like most businesses in this area, it's quite sad the work ethic here.  Most people work 9-5. How can you sit around the entire day and turn paying customers away in the evening?<//Text>

< review>
Out of town and my son and I desperately needed a haircut for a family event. Phill's fit the bill. Phill and his staff was very nice and organized including having a waiting list and giving approximate time before you were seen. Something my local barber shop doesnot do. There was plenty of seating and customers, who all seemed to be regulars, were great telling stories and joking around. There were 6 people in front of my son and I and an hour later we were seen. Phill cut my son's hair, my son is 6, and did a great job. He engaged my son in conversation and joked around with him. All in all a great experience and professional staff. The only downside and reason for a 4 star was the price. My 6 year olds haircut was $35, at our barbershop at home it is $8. My cut was $35 as well, my shop price is $15. Would I go back again when in town? Sure but if I lived locally this place would only be a once in  a while treat.< /review>

There's no better spot to get a haircut on the Monterey Peninsula. Good company, and monthly jam sessions. Sweet.< /Text>

Apparently now Phill's Barber Shop, not Gene's. A very careful and thorough haircut, Phill himself was also charming and intelligent. Would be my first choice for a haircut when next in California.</text>

<resp>None</resp><text>I had to renew my French passport. I had an appointment but had very low expectations having dealt with French bureaucracy too many times. To my surprise, the service was prompt and effective. I was in and out of the door within 35 minutes.
The lady at the front was very nice and courteous and Christoph , the person who helped me with my request, was very kind, efficient and professional.
There’s hope !
Few things I learned today.
-They’ll take your older passport at the end of the appointment
- On the label you create, the sender address should not be the French consulate ( as they were charged for it in the past) . He advised to just write your own address as sender as well as  receiver.
Good luck!</text>< gmapID>

When you can reach somebody they are very pleasant and helpful.
Their telephone system is extremely annoying you wait and wait, get from number x to your turn so you can have the privilege to listen to a message stating you have to call later.</review>

<review>I wish to acknowledge Beatrice for her extraordinary courtesy and compassion in regards to my need for an emergency passeport. I was able to visit my son who is gravely ill, and attend the concert in his honor.
Thank you so much for forwarding my dossier to the proper venue. I am endetted to you ! The level of compassion touched me deeply. I am French, and elderly. The digital world can be intimidating, but with the help of the administrative personnel at the Los Angeles French Consulate, I received all the help I needed with the proper level of efficiency .<//review><name>Madeleine Saenz< /name><pics>None</pics>< rate>

First things First. I had a wonderful experience. Very helpful staff. The Frenchman that helped me is from God. That guy was great. I think we are at the end of high season but I got my visa in 4 days (as of august 21,2017) . Now, I did review some posts in the past about the Asian Lady, they said to avoid her. While I didn't directly work with her and therefore cannot provide a full review about her, I must say that She doesn't look like she wants to be there. She seems as though she wakes up every morning expecting the worst from life and her job. She seems lonely and bitter. I'm not trying to scare you. Anyways make sure you have ALL of your documents. If you think one of you documents should be photocopied then DO IT. its better to have more photo copies than necessary. God be with you.< /Review>

So I went to apply for a student visa for an 8 month language program that will be followed with a master's program which will total to about two years. I am writing this to make sure that those doing the same as I aren't super scared for their visa appointment despite the things they've heard or read about french administration.

As long as you're on time with your appointment, and have read over all the instructions they're more than willing to help you. There were two gentlemen at the front  counter and they were very polite and will help you as much as they can.

Also, BRING COPIES AND A PASSPORT SIZE PHOTOGRAPH.

Like 4 out of the 5 people who were in the waiting room had to leave and come back cause they didn't bring their copies nor photos.

Besides that, I'm a happy camper with the service!<//Review>

I had a great experience with the consulate general of France at LA. The lady who interviewed me was super nice. She went through my documents, and asked two clarification questions. My photo seems too big, so she measured it with a ruler, cut it smaller, and accepted it. There is also an error on one of my documents, and she kindly asked me to email a correct version to her later. The whole process was very smooth and she was just very gentle and kind all the time. I was quite impressed.< /Review>

I was nervous because of the reviews but everything was so easy! I applied for a long stay student visa and went through Campus France first. After their approval, I made an appointment at this consulate and I was sure to have EVERYTHING very well prepared and organized. The lady was very nice and didn't ask me any questions at all. She just took my papers and looked through it as I watched her.. Then she took my fingerprints, picture and money and that was it. I was out in 15 minutes. My visa was processed and mailed to me in 2 business days. Now time to pack!< /Review>

I just called at 2.50 pm. today. The receptionist was very polite and right away a gentleman took the call. This gentleman was very courteous. I called about a matter which concerned me. He took the time to explain everything to me in very simple words. He was very pleasant and I was delighted with his services. After our conservation I had no more concerns.</Text>

I recently applied for a long stay visa here and they were extremely nice, helpful, welcoming and efficient.

They are very nice, very welcoming.. but still they try to scare you (in a good language) even though you know you are in a good position as a french resident just to test; if you are true then you will make it thru but if you are lying or illegal you will just stop trying (Personal experience as foreign national residing in France)< /text>

We came in for a 9am appointment and the whole process took about 25 minutes. For short term visa applicants, make sure to bring your most recent 3 months bank statements. We only brought the 3 months not counting the month just passed. But the officers would give you an email address that take pdf versions of the missing document. Also remember to bring in 2 standard passport photos, although they still take a picture and fingerprint at this location. It is certainly distracting that the officers keep chatting with each other, but I guess this is the french style administration.<//review>

<Review>Take the negative reviews with a grain of salt.  Had my student Visa appointment this morning and it was a great experience.  The security guard and the reviewers were nice, polite and easy to work with.  If you have all your documentation, arrive on time and are a person who treats others with respect and kindness you should be in and out within 15 minutes like I was.

For everyone who are going to get a visa, please BE PREPARED! it’s true they only have two officers there; so if you are there and realize you don’t have pre booked room, insurance, or tickets, you are wasting everything else’s time! The reason I wanna write this post is that three out of four applicants in front of me forgot some required documents. A lady even took more than half hour and part of her appointment just yelling getting a air ticket without a visa is too risky. The system could be rigid, but that’s not the reason to have an appointment and not be prepared. I appreciate all of you who are fully prepared before have the appointment!< /review>

I wrote an email asking for the status of an application after two months of being submitted and all I get back is a very kind sentense saying: “We don’t have an application with your name on it” there was not a question on when I submitted it, what was the application for, just a big plane nothing. Very! very! Very poor professionalism. Come on people, you’re in the 21st century; people want answers!!!!< /review><pics>None</pics><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80c2bb7d8dac77fb:0xb9343f4b44c20403<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I recently applied for Schengen French Visa, I did not carry the right paperwork, the consulate informed me what was missing.  They were very generous in granting me another appointment.  This was a busy period, however they are very prompt in responding to the emails.  Once I re-visited, my Visa was awarded in 6 hours.  The same day they Fedexed the visas. Quick note for everyone who is applying visas --> Please make sure you follow the rules completely and bring all the right paperwork.  The Consulate is very friendly, supportive.  I am now really looking forward to visiting Paris and France.</Text>

I'm a Washington resident. Was my dream to watch the French open Men's singles finals for many years. Bought the tickets for the finals for $1700. San Francisco consulate didn't have any appointments before June 6th, my intended date of travel. Got an appointment in Los Angeles consulate for May 9th. Flew down from Seattle to LA and when i reached the consulate they tell me i can't get a visa from there because i have to apply at San Francisco consulate as i reside in WA. Told them that there were no appointments available in SFO before my intended date of travel and that i already have bought the tournament tickets. The lady at the counter was very gentle and polite. But her boss sitting behind was very rude to me. He insisted that i should not be granted visa from there. A horrible and unreasonable guy! That guy needs to be taught some social etiquette and manners before being assigned to hold such a respectable position at a consulate representing a great nation such as France. With a heavy heart, i cancelled my trip and resold my ticket at a loss...:( Consulates should be little more intelligent when setting up appointment website bookings. If you don't grant visas to certain residents at a given consulate, make the website to not allow the booking of appointment itself! The amount of money and time that i wasted is quite a lot, because of this...< /Text>

<text>My sisters and I were in need of a notarie for a property transfer in France on short notice. We showed up at 9:00 am without an appointment and sat in a very comfortable waiting room for about 15 minutes, and had our business done in less than an hour. Everyone was helpful and cordial even though none of us was fluent in french. Much better experience than I was expecting.<//text>< Pics>

I now know why the Americans think that the French are so rude....it's because they send the most hateful people in the world to work at the US French Consulate in LA.  Very sad since I found the French people in Paris and Nice extremely kind.

I had spent 7.5 months preparing to apply for a visa, including paying for a flight to Los Angeles from another state.  I had a couple of questions on requirements listed on their website to ensure I arrived with all the required paperwork in order.  The woman on the phone was one of the most hateful people I've ever encountered.  She repeatedly cut me off, would only respond with "is that what it says on the website?" and "you need to read the website".  Then she barked at me that I was not ready to come and apply, to which I wanted to reply, "No s_ _t Sherlock.  That's why I'm calling you!"<//text>

<Review>Wish I could rate lower. The staff at the consulate was extremely unhelpful in allowing me to book my appointment, saw me 3 hours later than my scheduled appointment time, and then had delays on all VISAs in the office and caused me to lose thousands of dollars in travel plans.

AAAAAAARrrrrrgggggghhhhhhhh!!!! The perfect example of the administration that makes you go nuts! Worst service ever seen, people that instead of responding to your questions transfer you to dead ends! I try to take an appointment for a visa, which is mandatory, not possible!  Oh, and they are rude, cut you off in the middle of your sentence to put you on hold and make you wait on the phone for 45 min...  You guys need to fix this, this is unacceptable! Change the rules around visa maybe so that as a person living in Colorado, you don't have to go all the way to Los Angeles for 1 single appointment in order to get a visa! That would maybe allow you more time to take care of people!<//Review>

originally I went to embassy on may 30, and I was missing some documents and they wrote me all the required documents to complete.  then I got  my second appointment for  July 5th via VFS at their new location. Waited almost one hour and half before it was my turn. after I go in I find out that they additionally want a letter from employer (I explained one month earlier they never mentioned to me I need that, I still had the first officers hand writing about required documents). The officer for second interview did not care and stated they consulate is under some changes and they require things differently.
There is no good checklist online on the embassy website and when You get to embassy then they show you the checklist but its late as they wont allow you to go and print extra documents while waiting for your turn. I voiced my concern to the interviewer that my flight is Aug 17 and I applied for appointment in late May and it gave me my second interview on july 5 ( no other appointments were available). he stated no worries and they see 40 applicants each day and I should find an appointment before aug. I come home go online and check for appointment availability and Sure enough the next one is only aug 1. I finally go to  my third appointment, very sweet girl, everything  was complete and again I mentioned my flight is aug 17 and they said I should be fine.
its aug 16 now, I started calling them from aug 12.Washington dc consulate does not answer phone calls, emails only. they only responded one email "Your application is still under review. We are currently waiting from the accord from our international network and cannot expedite this stage of the process. Thank you for you understanding." they did not respond to any of my emails after that. Called VFS but they said they can't see anything until embassy update the status. I am missing my flights and have started canceling hotels, +4000$ in damages because travel insurance does not pay if you cannot make the trip due to visa delay.
Why does embassy asks about departure date if you are not able to issue visa for those dates and make people to make reservations and purchase tickets.
staff at french embassy have no empathy at all. everyone talked to me like they don't care. I never felt welcome unfortunately. My family have been planning for this vacation for 5 months.

I hope other people have better experience<//review>

<review>French Embassy in LA:
Most people say that Paris is a city of love and romance... but unfortunately, my experience with the staff have showed differently. Without any sign of love and compassion, they will consider you or your case as a mere "number" to their stack of files(by the way, you will easily find them literally on the floors just behind the french interviewers).
Being an extension of their own government and home country, I find staff here too inconsiderate! It is possibly due to the number of applicants that they cater each day that lack of empathy for their clients (even to urgent and pressing circumstances) are undeniably obvious located in every corner of the french embassy.
Unlike any other embassies, here you wont feel so much welcome nor expect to be treated with the standard hospitality (beware the first-hand experience of a FRENCH hospitality if you dare). They will not hesitate to inform you right away that your case shall be delayed or worst denied (unlike in other embassies that you will see staff to at least try or even take their time to find solutions or flex if needed based on the urgency of your needs)... its either because they have few numbers of personnel that can cater the demand or simply too slow in processing each individual cases. Going to the main Office of the French Consolate located upstairs wont make you feel better or will make a difference.
Phone services or reaching them by phone is definitely another horrible experience (once again you have been warned!!!)
Though Paris is a popular place to visit, I highly suggest to avoid this Embassy at all cost and if possible consider other embassies on your Europe trip. If also appicable, refrain France or cut visit days to Paris and simply extend days of visit to another Schengen host countries to qualify you esp in applying for a Visa... wherein other Embassies (like Greek) will treat you well as a person and not merely another disposable paying applicant.< /review><Time>1489391745183</Time>< name>

I am fluent in French. I have lived there. I have worked there. The service was good until a Mr. Menin took over. They made me take the TEF equivalency exam three times because of their delays, causing the TEF validity to expire. They refuse to take responsibility, and refuse to speak by phone, and send very sarcastic letters. I will keep you all informed! These guys represent the old stereotype of the Franco-American animosity that is not in France. Tradition dies hard. Zero stars for LA!</review>

<text>Absolutely horrible. This place deserves 0 stars. The lack of customer service is appalling. Having been to French consulates all over the world, the Los Angeles branch is by far the worst.

Don't come too early if you are here for visa appointment. The office is very small so you will have  to wait outdoor (outside of the building) till almost appointment time. The office locates at the back corner of the building by Alliance Francais.</Text>

I had to apply urgently and apparently all the spots for the interview were taken in advance.
Consulate workers were extremely nice and understanding to a degree that they could accomodate me and provide a spot, not to mention that I got my visa in 4 days.
It took me about 20 mins and then I just received my visa by overnight Fedex.
Thank you so much to wonderful people working there!</text>< Pictures>

Ok so here is my experience with the french consulate. At the beginning I felt as if they were rude, but then I put myself in their shoes. They receive hundreds of visa applications and calls. So they are trying to be  fast as possible when they ask you to read everything is because they know that you actually skipped some important parts. I went to get my visa and this was my first time ever filling these type of paper work. (In my country my parent's secretary used to filled them up for me( yeah I was super spoiled)) so I was proud of myself. But then they told me  that there was some documents missing, so I went back and I still was missing a letteR, but this one I promise I had it before. I was shaking because time was clicking and I need the visa asap  . She gave me the chance to go print out the paper (again) and come back. I am so grateful for this and honestly it felt good to do this paperwork with people that really make you read every single thing.<//Text>

I recently visited the French Consulate to notarize French documents. The visit was quick and most pleasant; I was received with the upmost professionalism and my request was promptly executed - I am very grateful to Ms Marie-Jo Halty and Mr Laurent Brunet, the Vice-Consul of France in Los Angeles, for their assistance.
I highly recommend that all French citizens living in or near Los Angeles register with the Consulate and take advantage of the excellent services provided!
Merci, a bientot!</Text>

(Translated by Google) I did not find how to put them 0 so I put 1/5 ... Horrible hours and staff unable to help anyone by laziness. In short, enough to remind us why we left France.

<review>(Translated by Google) Our daughters (17) coming to live in Los Angeles to study. I was thinking of registering them at the French consulate and at the same time asking if there was a French community, addresses of doctors and other information.
We were unable to access the French consulate. We were greeted by a microphone with a person behind the door, telling us that the check-in was being done online.
Very disappointed with the reception of the French consulate in Los Angeles.

Nos filles (17 ans) venant habiter à Los Angeles pour étudier. Je pensais les enregistrer  au consulat de France et en même temps demander s’il y avait une communauté française, des adresses de médecins et autres renseignements.
Nous n’avons pas pu accéder au consulat de France. Nous avons été reçu par un micro avec  une personne derrière la porte, nous dire que l’enregistement se faisait en ligne.
Très déçue de l’accueil du consulat de France à Los Angeles.</review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None</response>< GmapID>

<review>(Translated by Google) I find deplorable the future appointment of the new consul, Philippe Besson cronyism for service rendered to Macron. The French need professionals, real diplomats.
We have had enough of the Benalla, Alexis Kholer affairs ... this government demeans France's image abroad! No to P. BESSON!

<text>I went in and asked the front desk girl how much for gel nails, no manicure, and she said $20. By the time the technician was done and took me to the front desk to pay, she (the technician) told me it was $30 and told her I was initially told it was $20. She then said that she was charging me $30 because she did a mini manicure on my hands cause I needed it. I don't know what she was talking about because all she did was the usual procedure to apply gel. I honestly didn't have time to argue so I paid and left but I'm never going back! Horrible experience!< /text>< pictures>

They were pretty fast but i asked them how much it was going to be for 2 manicures and 1 pedicure and they told me it was one price and then I had to run to get cash and came back and they gave me a higher price than what they had originally told me before running to the bank.< /text>

I love this place, I’ve gone here a few times with my sister and I always get my nails done. The ones who do my nails did a good job, although I would recommend putting the gel so they don’t fall off in such a short time. Cause last time I didn’t get the gel and it fell off in about 2 days but other than that I love it!!!</review>

My favorite and very 1st manicurist there was Ben who left the salon right after I stopped the gel acrylic to let my nails breath about 4 to 5 years ago. But I recently started back the gel a few months ago and now Richard who still works there is just as good and is patient and listens to me very intently and provides wonderful service.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

I use to go here for my nails and went on a no nail thing after having a baby. If you go there ask for TRON for your nails he’s the best in there hands down, and for your eye brows PLEASE ONLY GO Sydney ❣️. She listens to your needs and does them how you want them</Text>

The shop was initially in a large space but last year the size of the business was cut in half. Basically it is smaller in size. It does not look like the number of customers has diminished but know your wait for service is longer and the area for waiting is not very large. I am not a regular patron but do when I  in the area. So far the services are pretty good and the prices are reasonable. I only have a problem with some of the technicians providing services. I am picky and expect services but some of them aren't  people persons. When you are in this business of providing services they need to learn how to how to make your customer feel you want to provide service. They are interested in the tip only. But this is my opinion try it for yourself!< /Text><Gmap_id>0x80855995fd860fb5:0xafdbfdcb3b43a6d9</Gmap_id>< Rating>

<rate>1<//rate><Text>Beware when you get something for free. Last two times I got the two earned free services they really sucked! First visit they screwed up my eyebrows. On a different occasion it was with individual eyelashe extensions which had to be removed the next day. They had a very difficult time removing them because of the excessive amount of glue that was put on them, which was what had irritated my eyes. They had glued the extensions to my skin. It's like they give u trainees or something for the freebies. You ask for one thing and they always say yes they have it or yes they can do it and at the end it all turns out they apparently don't know how to paint your nails that way or they totally do so many things you didn't ask for that you have to pay for. They always act like they don't understand what you say, but I'm pretty sure after so many years they would have already caught on. Although I guess that if you're in a hurry and can't wait to make an appointment then their the one for you. If it's been working for you then that's  great too.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<Review>I went to this spa to get a full set of acrylics, the acrylics were cute but weren't good quality. My nails fell off in like three days while I was at school, that usually never happens. When I get my nails done at other places, they fall off in about two weeks. The money I paid was unbelievably high for the design I got. I asked for coffin shaped nails that were one solid color and they were short. They had poor quality of service, they don't seem happy and they have low energy. The woman that was doing my nails made a comment in a different language,  that I didn't understand, and pointed at my nails as another woman was walking by. I will say my nails were dirty, but the fact that she probably said something about them made me anxious. Overall, my experience was bad, the quality, service, and energy were bad. I would not recommend this spa if you are looking for acrylics.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x80855995fd860fb5:0xafdbfdcb3b43a6d9< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>Whether its eyelashes, eyebrows, nails, or toes; the wait has never been too long. It's a pretty big salon; even if it looks busy and full ive been in and out everytime. The appearance and atmosphere is a bit on the sloppy slide. I however, but fair priced. I've been happy with my nails so It keeps me coming back</review>< Date>

While my nails turned out great, I was very uncomfortable with the fact that this location makes "certain people" pay in advance. When I overheard a mom getting upset that her teenage daughter was told she had to pay before they would start her nails, I asked my nail tech what was happening. He explained I didn't have to pay in advance because of how i look, he feels like I am going to pay but they don't think the black teenage girl will pay. They ask people that look like her to pay in advance because others similar have walked out with out paying in the past. Because of this racism, regardless if it were to another race, is unacceptable and I will not be returning.<//Text>

Terrible service, made an appt for a certain time and I've been waiting THIRTY MINUTES, I have several services scheduled and they haven't gotten me up for one. When I went to the front the receptionist gave me attitude and a face. Only reason I'm not walking out is tomorrow is Christmas Eve and everywhere else is booked.</review>

They not right, they rude, they try to tax and over charge, no customer service skills whatsoever. I have been going there for years. The good ppl are ran out and it’s a lot of favoritism. Unfair and low quality treatment with unprofessional attitudes.< /text>

They only have one person in this place that for me does a very good and satisfied work. She wasn't available today so unfortunately my pedicure for this time isn't good enough. And for eye brows I have the same experience.</review>

<Review>I like what they offer for a pedicure. My feet usually feel soft and rejuvenated upon finish. As for my nails I've had to go back twice the next day due to them chipping or breaking off. They polish nails terribly. The finish nails never cover the whole nail.<//Review>< pics>

<Text>Awful place... I had a Cracked nail.. I specifically asked if I needed it reolaced rather than filled. The girl was unfriendly.. Never spoke a word to me.. I asked for rounded tops was shaped into square.. Wanted shorter.. Was ignored.. When finished you could see the crack!! I again asked if could be replaced was told it was fine... I left... It instantly broke off.. Had to go to another place to get repair</Text>< Pictures>

<Review>Rushed me thru since I had prior acrylic nails to be removed she passed me on to the open seat next to her and made me sit there to soak the nails like I was in a time out.
All the while she takes another client (a full set!) ok I would understand maybe if she took something quick like a manicure while mine were soaking off but she basically pushed me to the side and replaced me with someone else when she realized it was gonna be too much work to actually take the time to file my old acrylics off (all of 5 mins tops)
Then I was sent to some other chick who was just about to leave so when she realized she had one more customer she rushed through my nails SO FAST and did the WORST job I’ve ever seen. I could have done 1000tomes better myself. In fact, I went and bought an e-file and now I am doing my own builder gel acrylic nails and they look million times better than any nail place can do. One purchase of the e-file and nail supplies pays for itself after one time at the nail salon ($50+!) on Amazon you want something done right you just have to do it yourself these days it’s the sad truth of everyone in a hurry trying to make that extra buck good customer service has gone extinct. Shame on you My nails.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><gmap_id>0x80855995fd860fb5:0xafdbfdcb3b43a6d9</gmap_id><username>Bay area Babe<//username></record></dataset><record>

My wife goes to this place quite often she gets seen by chair number 2  But for some reason he didn't want to do my wife's nails today she even got a pedicure waiting for him and at the end they told me he didn't wanna do my wife's nails I believe it was because last time the guy that sits next to him I got in an argument with him because he did my wife nails and on the same day  her my nail fell off so the girl that works at the front desk recommend this other guy at chair 11 and told my wife he knows how to do long nails but at the end he glued them on and sanded them down to medium size at that point there was nothing I could do  I don't understand how they can get away with that  When you clearly tell them to do something and they do the opposit and if you're not happy you still have to pay for it terrible please don't go there don't let them due that to you.</Text>

I'm from out of town and went there with my nieces to enjoy a girl day. I requested chrome polish and was told they didn't have it. They offered me a similar product called metallic for $20 more so I pick the brightest color and I can tell you my feet have never felt less sexy. My technician wasn't pleasant, and because I didn't have enough time rather than changing the Polish I just cancelled the rest of my services including designs and manicures because I was disappointed. After all this I now come home after getting the deluxe pedicure with the massage and green tea wrap and my feet shins have not stopped itching since I came home.  I've already told my nieces to make sure they don't go back to the salon.</Text>

The worst!!!
Omg this place is horrible!!
My nails are different size,  you can tell from far away. My daughters are bumpy and rough.
We were charged $20 more on top of what they said  when we came in..
This place is just the worst  nail  place I have ever been.
And when u are going  to pay they ask for tip!I!< /review>

They were rude towards my 14 year old daughter because they thought she took a picture of the eyebrow Waxing station. I've been there for years and have never been so mad at the way my child was treated, and why are they mad at Picture's being taken anyway it must be a health code issue because most business owners don't get mad at pictures being taken .They lost a family of customers after this I'll take my business elsewhere</review>

< Review>
I never do reviews, but I'm so disappointed in the service so I felt it was my duty to help some one else. I went to my nail and spa in Pittsburg Ca for individuals lashes. She installed the lashes on top of the eyelid. I was not a custom to the way she did it.  I absolutely hate the way the natural lashes didnt blend with the fake lashes. I paid $30 and 2 days later the lashes started to lift. Please beware, dont want anyone to waste their money like I did.<//Review>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Text>I went in with a friend last Wednesday and got a gel manicure for the first time. By last night (Sunday - only four days later) two nails had peeled off completely with four more beginning to lift. I went in this morning to have them fixed, and was told I'd have to pay $15 because I didn't have the receipt (my friend paid). I didn't want to deal with the hassle of making my friend find her receipt then coming back, since having two missing nails was annoying. The man who redid my nails did a nice job (although it's only been a few minutes, so time will tell if they hold up), but then brought me a receipt for $25 saying I'd asked for a manicure as well. I had not, I just wanted them to fix their mistake. The man who had been behind the counter who originally said $15 was not there when I went to pay, so I could not ask him about this new mistake.

Needless to say, as my first experience with gel nails, this was not a great first impression. I'm incredibly unhappy that my friend paid for a crappy service, and that I then had to pay full price for them to fix it. I won't be visiting this "salon" again. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice... not gonna happen.</Text>< pics>

Since they made their shop smaller the wait times are ridiculous, but the service is great. Extensive pedicures and my acrylic nails are still on and haven't lifted at all. I'll definitely go back, but I will make an appointment for sure.<//Review>

They have the worse service and they hate black people. They sit around doing your nails while talking about you calling you names in their language and talking bad about the way you look or how your feet looks.  They use to have good service many years ago but for some reason everything has went completely downhill they are all about the money not the service. As soon as we walked in the door today we were treated coldly and made to feel unwelcome. I had a lady named Mary today and she was talking about me with two other ladies in their own language. They have no clue I know how to understand Vietnamese and I am black.<//review>

Made an appointment to have my eyebrows done. I don't remember her name because this was my first time going. When I entered the establishment it was packed and super busy! However, I'm so glad I waited. The lady did my eyebrows to perfection. I don't remember the last eyebrow lady that did my eyebrows so clean and she actually knows how to arch my eyebrows as in some people say they know, but don't deliver.<//Review>

Since they made their shop smaller the wait times are ridiculous, but the service is great. Extensive pedicures and my acrylic nails are still on and haven't lifted at all. I'll definitely go back, but I will make an appointment for sure.</Text>

<review>Paid $35 for delux pedicure  and $25 for manicure. Both process  were done very rush.
Is been 2 days today sence i got my pedicure and manicure  done. First  of all my toes finger  nails  already  pilling  off and supposed  i got gel polish because  it lasts longer.
I call  them to  let them knw and see if  they were able to fixed  them ,they respond  to me with,( a yes but i would have to pay more money) . It was very upsetting
. Im not the tipe  of person tha likes to cause drama. So after a bad service  while  getting my nails done,And seeing  my nails all mess up and pilling off,
I respond  with, okay thanks , and hang  up.  I will never come back here to get  my pedicures  n manicures done thts all.< /review>< userid>

Been going here since 2009.  Service was good until 07/21/17. Had 5:30 appointment, by 6:30 still wasn't seen. Apparently, no more respect for appointments.   I will be looking for a new nail salon.</review>

<Review>Every visit seems to get worse and worse. Awful customer service and poor quality of service. They rush on your nails and pedicures and when you complain they get an attitude. I might as well save my money and polish my own toes and nails because I'm sure I would do a better job. They are quick to ask for your payment then don't want to fix the awful polish job or dislike of color. I will be taking my money else where!!!</Review></record></dataset><record>

I never do reviews, but I'm so disappointed in the service so I felt it was my duty to help some one else. I went to my nail and spa in Pittsburg Ca for individuals lashes. She installed the lashes on top of the eyelid. I was not a custom to the way she did it.  I absolutely hate the way the natural lashes didnt blend with the fake lashes. I paid $30 and 2 days later the lashes started to lift. Please beware, dont want anyone to waste their money like I did.</Review>

Was excited today to go for a pedicure with my older sister. We made spur of the moment decision to go here. They were busy. As to be expected on Saturday. My sister had noticed the towel they put over the chair she was to sit-in, was very dirty, she kindly asked them if they could put a new one on?  That's when the lady got really angry. She had my sister sit in the chair and she basically ignored her. Even started fileing her own nails.  After watching this for awhile, my  sister,  finally asked if she was up set? She raised her voice an said she complained about the towel then  she  stormed away to the front desk, raising her voice. All the other customers saw this. It was highly embarrassing I asked her if she could just please be nice to my sister that my sister's in her sixties and I brought her here to have her feet pampered, and if she wanted, someone else could do it. She said yes she would be nice to her.  By this time a man had come and work on my feet he did an ok job.   And while this was going on I did enjoy a conversation with a Lady that also worked there. However just the mere fact of somebody having to raise their voice getting so angry at their work environment over being asked to change the towel is a scary situation. Her co workers kept trying to calm her down.  I would not recommend this nail salon to anyone.< /text>

< Review>
I don't have a regular person I go to for my eyebrows but everyone over the past 6 months have done a great job.

Update: so 5 months ago I posted that everyone that has done my eyebrows has done a great job. But today that changed. My eyebrows look like they're going through two different emotions right now because the tech tweeze too much hair and my eyebrows became too thin. My eyebrows are naturally thick there's no reason to over tweeze. The tech did offer to try to correct them but once again once you've over tweezed you really just have to wait for the hair to grow back. Very unsatisfied.<//Review>

$95.00 for gel mani and pedi. My nails came out ok not fantastic for that price. Payless elsewhere and get my nails done better and faster. French tip lines not even, don't match with the other hand or foot. One foot my nails are square shape and the other round shape. File very short when asked not to file my nails. My right hand is missing gel clear coat on 3 fingers doesn't' look the same as the others. Ask lady to adjust and add less to the french tip design she gets bother says I'm too picky. I don't like thick line and prefer thin natural look . I am paying for a service want good service especially if paying that much it should come out better. great service, but don't like my nails how they came out. Really didn't want to leave a tip she persuade me into it.

$55.00 gel pedi + $40.00 gel mani  = $95  (2hrs) + tip< /Text>

Service is horrible. I asked for powder and I was told they were out completely. They cut me twice. I was given a gift card and rhe guy at the counter rook it back. I would never go back again.  If I could I would give it zero stars.< /Review>

<review>There are time service can be great, on the other hand customer service can be bad. I came in one early morning and this #14 was rude, yelling, arguing with a customer. I was instructed to go to her chair. She did not state she was not doing my nails. But sat me at a desk to soak and begin on another client. I personally would have said, " Im going to soak your nails someone else will do you service." Oh my gosh she was a time bomb. Yelling it too early it's to early for this. Another experience was the guy #23 doing my nails was on the phone the entire time very loud. He stayed on his cell the entire time of my service. The manager is not very friendly and do not provide a warm welcome. If you talk to the owner/ manager he will ignore you. If you come for a fill they refuse to do a fill they want to charge you for a new set when all you need is a fill. They should welcome their guest with, "welcome to My Nail Spa,"<//review>< Pics>

<Review>I used to go here every other week about a year ago. The prices have raised and my nails kept breaking. The young lady at the front desk actaully told me I would have to pay for 2 broken nails and that the acrylic must be old. Doesn't sound very santitary to have old acrylic and not fair to have your customers pay gor technicians mistakes. I was disappointing that both sets I got done here had broken nails within days. They only guarantee their nails will last for 3 days. Too expensive and bad customer service. I used to love coming here. Now I must find another shop. I would not recommend this establishment.<//Review>< rating>

HORRIBLE SERVICE! I use to be a routine customer, but over time the service and customer service went down hill. I decided to give them one more chance the other day. When I first walked in the place looked filthy. Dirt and dust everywhere. I was getting a pedicure and watched the worker next to me clean the tub where you put your feet in. She literally put a little water and scrubbed the tub with a dirty sponge and that was it. I was in shock. After my toes were done I went to get a manicure. When I sat down the gentlemen that was doing my manicure seemed really nice. I showed him what I would like and he stated they have the exact colors I was wanting. Well when he started putting my colors and design I showed him, they were not the exact colors. I then said NICELY do you have a color similar to what I want and he stated this will look nicer. I stated NICELY I am sorry to be a pain but I don't really like these colors, can I just do one set color. All he had to do was change two nails, one on each hand. When I told him this he flipped and started making rude comments in another language. And then started being rude and breathing hard while he had to change the TWO NAILS I wanted to change. This is not the first time one of their workers began to flip out and began being rude. I do not suggest this place at all. Four reasons: rude employees, the place is filthy, management does nothing to help and very long waits.</Text>

Honestly, they dont even deserve 1 star. The workmanship is a joke. They are extremely overpriced. Rude. I've had my gel nail polish shrivel up on me on 5 different occasions. Just all around poor quality, poor service, poor workmanship. I've given this place the benefit of the doubt plenty of times but i just refuse to go back there now. I just started going to VK nails in concord, WAYYYYY BETTER. 😊</text>

Worst ever. They're sloppy , They rush , never thorough, if they mess up they get an attitude when they have to fix there work and never completely willing to fix there work they'll just throw you off to the next nailtech especially if they feel your asking to much they'll get up to have the receptionists come an tell you they rather someone else do your nails, they dont listen to customers needs they do as they please an get attitudes even then when you want things done specific. And prices vary for the same exact kind of work design or length one nailtech will say this the other will say that  They just want to do things how they want get your money an send you out the door unsatified with a oohwell mentality. This is all from experience from over the past 7 years including todays experience an im officially fed up an never going back.. i suggest others dont either yeah the first and second time may be good but become a regular an your start to see for yourself. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME the idea of a nail spa sounds ideal but they are far from having the hospitality that anything attatched to spa should have 😡😐😐<//Review>

<text>It's too bad I couldn't post a picture because I wanted to show you the bleeding my toe did. And I can handle that that's not a big deal it was the attitudes of the workers that were not very pleasant I would never recommend this place to anyone it was really bad service period when you have an appointment expect to wait an hour for service< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

Everything just felt very unpersonal. This was my first time going there and I only wanted an eyebrow wax. The lady didn't ask me how I wanted them or anything at all she just started cutting the tops of my eyebrows with scissors then proceded to apply the cheap wax. After waxing there was 20min of her using the tweezer n more scissors.  When I saw the end result I was disapointed one eyebrow is differnt than the other and waaay thinner than i wanted. I ended up jus fixing them myself the best I could...but I still look lyk im angry due to the dramatic evil eyebrow shape she gave me. Go to a nice salon n pay the extra $2.</Review>

<name>Rhiannon Pinson<//name><Review>The day after getting a full set done here, the nail polish and nails started lifting on multiple fingers. I went to have them fixed and they told me it was "normal wear and tear" and would therefore have to charge me a second time to fix them! Thanks If this is "normal" for their nails, which it should never be, it is not worth the money.  Very disappointing to say the least. I took my business elsewhere.</Review>< user>

I've been coming here for yrs. Lately things seem so messy. Taking forever to start her appt. My toe nails look horrible. I'm saying Goodbye to this place now. The ladies that work there were acting like teenagers. One of the workers didn't like a lady in the salon. You lady's were being mean, there is so space for mean in this world, specially when your job is customer service.<//text>

The Dry Creek Trail in the fall is an awesome place to go for a walk or run. There are definitely times that are more high traffic, e.g., nice weather, weekends, but it is manageable even in a crowded day due to the space to either side of the trail if you adhere to social distancing. Be aware that the majority of the folks are not wearing masks! There are a couple of stations for dog duty bags and a bathroom by the children's park. Many people take their dogs for a walk there and the majority are well behaved (90%). Some stretches are cooler than others due to the shade the trees provide. There's also parking at Sunnyside and Shepherd.</Text>

<Review>Loved the trail! Lots of good things to look at, and a great place for our scooters. The trailhead with the clockwork horse statue, was impressive in the extreme. Hike this trail, bike it, or do what we did, and scooter it.</Review>< Response>

The trail would be great if you didn't have to cross busy streets. We can't even walk along the gravel part of the canal anymore.< /Text>

The trailhead has a display that detected and counts the number of people that pass through the trail entrance daily and in the year to date. It is interesting to know that half way through the year the trail has been used at least 100k times.<//review>

Beautiful trail by the creek with plenty of shade and scenery. Walking, running or bike riding it's a nice way to exercise with a view.</Text>

Clovis and Fresno have miles of great trail systems for walking running or biking ...many of the trails border waterways or meander through tree lined walkways and parks.< /text>

<user>100655815225378105331</user><Review>One of my families favorite trails in the city. Lots of trees to provide shade for the morning hours. As the sun moves into the west, shade decreases. It is nice that it links up with other trails too so one can “keep going” beyond the Dry Creek Trail portion. Nice to have public bathrooms, water, picnic areas, playground in the middle of the trail, and more.< /Review><pics>None</pics><Gmap_id>0x809444a99ccf800d:0x2b24a6a75ae4ada0</Gmap_id>< Rating>

Comfortable enough to eat lunch with the kids.

<Review>Consistently great experience and level of freshness. This is by far my favorite BCD tofu house. Tastes better than the restaurants in LA. See photo of side dishes. They always serve ~8 more side dishes than LA locations. Also corvina dinner entree is crispy (can tell they fry in clean oil).<//Review><pics>None< /pics><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x80dd2b753419e379:0xbbdc27f9b2feead7<//Gmap_id></record>

Terrible foods.  The meat was uncooked on the inside and all  burnt on the outside.  The staffs and the cashiers were very unkind.</Review>

<Text>Korean fast-food serving the regular fare but with great appetizers, especially the fried fish. Kimchi served is not as spicy hot although it's a little salty, as expected. Steamed rice in stone pots and the portions are reasonable, so with the overall price. Good place to have a quick bite if yo like Korean food. Credit cards are accepted, parking is free.<//Text><Response>None< /Response>< pictures>

<review>We ended up here on New Years Eve for Dinner before heading over to a party. We were concern about the wait time during dinner hours. To our surprise, there wasn't any wait like Garden Grove or Irvine where I actually walked away because of the long lines.
Food and Staff were excellent. Especially the Squid that is part of the side dishes. I actually bought a jar to enjoy at home.
I would drive here in the future rather than waiting over 45 minutes or more in the other places.< /review>< pics>

So good.  I got the dumpling tofu bowl and hot stone bibimbop combo.  The taste was great.  The service was good but they don't really return to you unless you wave them down.  They were very busy for a 930pm Thursday  evening.  I recommend this place if you want a tofu bowl.</text>

Wow I love this place. At fist I was skeptical because  "tofu house..." c'mon I need some meat!!! But tofu is just the name. The place definitely has great Korean dishes with meat and the soup is awesome. I was thoroughly blown away from my skepticism. They even give you a fish to start off along with all the side dishes. Definitely recommend checking this place out. I would definitely go back.<//Text>

If you eat in, you get two fried fish each person. The spicy tofu soup is what this restaurant is known for. If you take out, you will get one fried fish per item. The soup is usually 8.99 or 9.99 depending on which you choose. The dishes come with fresh rice, eggs to drop into your soup, side dishes, and toasted rice porridge once you finish.< /review>

Actually i don't eat tofu, but the thing I come for is the hot stone pot with various veggies and your choice of beef or tofu. It comes with all these wonderful side dishes which include a small fried fish, spicy raw squid, fishcake, pickles, bean sprouts,  kimchi and more. The service is great - they cater to my specifics and remember the next time I come!<//Text>

<review>This is a good location of the BCD chain. Good tofu soup, good side dishes, and pretty decent LA galbi too. I've never felt rushed here as a previous reviewer mentioned, but that's possibly a time of day thing I suppose. In fact I'd say the service is well above average for a Korean restaurant.</review><date>1421994066194</date>< user_id>

<Text>Poor service and food at this bcd location, go to the one on Wilshire or Western instead. At first they tried to seat me at a small table and I asked to sit at a larger table which clearly upset the waitress even though the restaurant was nearly empty. As soon as I sat down she asked what I was ordering and I asked to have some time to read the menu so the waitress left grumpily. I ordered the bulgolgi combo and when the side dishes came out the fish was cold. So they later brought the same fish which I thing they microwaved.  The waitress sullenly scooped out the stone pot rice but didn't put water in it until we called for the manager . The manager was very nonchalant and didn't apologize. When we told him how much better food and service at the bcd on wilshire had his response was he used to work there. So we told him he should run this location the same way as the wilshire branch. My recommendation is to not come to the Buena Park bcd until they improve their service and food.<//Text>< user_id>

<text>My mom wanted to come here for her birthday. We put our name and waited for an hour and 30 minutes. We thought it was because there was no seating but there were 6 tables open that no one was using. Then they called a group of six that just came in and skipped us completely. They claimed that they had already called us but i was sitting right there in front of the list listening for our name. And nope I only heard the names Patricia and Daniel. Then they gave us a menu (we werent even seated) and said "we will come back to you". The guy didnt smile and just gave a blank stare. Smh the previous manager was way nicer. But with the new manager, the place is run without much effort and it kinda shows.<//text></record>

I love this place. My wife and I are from las vegas and we make sure we stop and eat here whenever we come to California. The staff is awesome and so is the food. I REALLY wish that they had a BCD tofu house in Las Vegas.</text>

(Translated by Google) BCD in Los Angeles is so famous that no explanation is needed anymore. There is an evaluation that it is no longer tastier than before, but you may think that it is a nice taste of Korea for tourists from Korea. You may have to wait a little while in the evening, but it is a Korean restaurant that you can enjoy at home.

(Original)
LA에서 BCD는 워낙 유명해서 더이상 설명은 필요 없을 것 같습니다. 예전보다 맛이 없어졌다는 평가도 있습니다만, 한국에서 오신 관광객들에게는 반가운 한국의 맛이라는 생각이 드실겁니다. 저녁시간에는 다소 기다리셔야 할 지도 모르겠습니다만, 그래도 편안히 즐길수 있는 한국음식점입니다.<//Text>

<text>(Translated by Google) The tofu stew made with non-polluting food was delicious. The characteristic side dish was also good. The lines are long and need patience. There is also a lack of parking space.

<review>(Translated by Google) Spare ribs too expensive. Don't let the ribs go, eat it with ham, eat steak at a western restaurant, or eat unlimited barbecue at a restaurant. 8 pieces of meat about $ 20 and folded in half.

<review>(Translated by Google) The stone-grilled rice was so hard to chew. My husband ate pork soft tofu and had diarrhea all night. Dingulding oysters that he was sick.. Boiled in the morning to soothe the inside.. I went to a good memory in the past, but I also made a side dish. It wasn't in good condition as if it had been laid out for a long time... and it didn't look too sincere.

Just sightseeing looking at the Hollywood stars I learned that you can go up the escalators in the mall and they have a walkway where you can view the Hollywood sign and you can look through binoculars if you choose to lots of shops you can buy souvenirs when it gets dark the lights come on so it makes it fun good times< /Text>

If you are a first time visitor to Los Angeles, you must see Hollywood Blvd. Hollywood is bright , busy and  has two sides. West Holly and East Holly. East Hollywood is home to traditional restaurants, cafes and gay bars. West Hollywood is area known for its nightlife. In the day it's more for tourists to take pictures of the stars on the ground and  take pictures with people in costumes. However, Hollywood has a plethora of homeless people. Visiting is okay but living in Hollywood is a whole different story. Food and rental prices are expensive. Welcome to Hollywood!</Text>

Be careful where your camera is pointed, even though you don't have your finger on the shutter button. A person was stabbed by the person she was photographing. I myself was shoved to the ground from behind for taking a photograph of a puppy that a person was selling. The person who shoved me was some Russian guy. There were no police to be seen, and people don't care. There are pickpockets and con-men up and down the boulevard, and it's safe to say most of them carry knives. AAPI, this is not a safe place for you, so take your tourist vacation elsewhere for your safety.</text>< pics>

Hollywood Blvd is a fun tourist attraction in Las Angeles. If you're in town visiting Los Angeles or Hollywood, this is a fun little walk and stroll. Be on the watch for the homeless though, they're looking for tourists, so be sure you're aware of your situation and watch out for poop and other items on the street. It's not unsafe, but you should be careful.< /Text>

Lots of people, dirty streets with unpleasant smells, lots of homeless people, very expensive public parking lots. It is a famous tourist spot but I really feel that it is to see it once and now.

(Translated by Google) In the same beautiful place with the graphics in the GTA 5 game, the names of special players are written on the pavement, but only Muhammet Ali's name is not on the ground because he says;
-My name is the name of the prophet, so Mohammed Ali's name is not written on the floor.

(Translated by Google) It seems to me a city stopped several years ago. Many differences are noted even when comparing with neighboring states in municipal and regional management. There is hostility towards investments and you can see
See everything deteriorating, many businesses closed before and during the covid. Many homeless people who at the same time are under the influence of legal drugs or not, it is what dominates the view of the avenue and by the way there are no police officers there is no general sense of security despite the fact that there is still a beautiful city.

The whole LA made an impression on me, but you have to remember about the large number of homeless people ... poverty and wealth - such a contrast is starting to appear (not only in LA) and you should keep it in the back of your head before traveling ....

Zdania co do Los Angeles są podzielone , a to dlatego ,że ludzie mają nie wiadomo jakie oczekiwania i są potem zawiedzeni. 3 dni na zwiedzanie wystarczy , choć by poczuć klimat miasta wypada w nim spędzić tydzień.
Na mnie całe LA zrobiło wrażenie , ale trzeba pamiętać o dużej liczbie bezdomnych ....bieda i bogactwo - taki kontrast zaczyna się pojawiać(nie tylko w LA)  i należy mieć to z tyłu głowy przed podróżami ....<//text>< pics>

Got the dirty south which is caramel ice cream, candied pecans, and bourbon swirl.

First, I got the mini (non-pint) size. First taste was very caramel-ly but it had more of a burnt caramel taste to it vs a very sweet rich caramel taste. After the 3rd bite, I could definitely taste the bourbon swirl and at some points, the bourbon taste took over the whole ice cream flavor so if you’re looking for ice cream that’s got that extra alcohol taste, this is it. I will say that the combo of caramel and bourbon after taste reminded me of licorice a bit.

The service was amazing though. The person over the counter was very welcoming and patient.<//text>

This place was everything and more than expected!! The line out front only solidified our notions that we were in the right place. So delicious. Rich, creamy decadent flavors. We could not finish it all. Nice to take home some of the memory. 😋😋</text>

It was 90°F the day I went so this was perfect. The employees had a lot of patience with everyone wanting to try so many flavors. They had the most unusual I've encountered: asparagus; tasted just like asparagus if you're into it. I'd come back to see what they'll offer next.</text>

First time having and ordering from Little Giant Ice Cream. However, the mint brownie ice cream was a huge disappointment. It's was more like a pint of mint ice cream. No brownie at all! Maybe I'll give the shop another try but as of now, no.< /text>

A huge selection of both standard, and creative flavors of ice cream. The portions are very generous, and the ice cream is SUPER rich to begin with. Excellent selection of flavors, plus they normally have a few seasonal options, and an alcoholic flavor (5%) for kicks. Excellent ice cream, with packed to-go pints available, freshly baked cookies, and excellent service. Definitely worth your while to check out.</text>

<review>I really enjoyed the ice cream here. It was really tasty but the flavor I got was pretty sweet so I was fine with just a tiny portion. Their cookies are hella good! I got the rainbow sprinkle one and it had such a buttery, sweet taste.

The only thing that would make the experience a little better is to have 1-2 regular flavors (cookie dough, chocolate chip, etc) just for the less adventurous of us. Otherwise, great spot. Really cute decor as well.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

It's small and homey, but can get crowded a bit easily then quickly empty. The tables are cute and nice and there's an optional amount of flavors of icecream, but at the same time, not that much as me myself, I'm a picky eater and so I wasny that interested in many. And the ones I were interested in were almost empty.</review>

Great flavors but overpriced and they keep raising the price! Uptown residents should get a discount since we're so close, I'd go more often! $10 a pint is pretty steep. But their Sundaes on Sunday deal is great (free upgrade to a sundae every Sunday)<//review>

Great ice cream shop!  I was happy to find 4-5 non-dairy options including some unique flavors.  The service was very friendly and they patiently offered multiple tastings.  Got a fresh and warm waffle cone with my scoop!</review>

<review>Cute little Oakland Ice cream shop, with a great selection and many options. The non-dairy options are great, making this place a wonderful option for all people. I would recommend getting the cookies with ice cream inbetween, as they are super thick and delicious. A bit on the pricey side, but not bad for the area.</review><rate>5</rate><Name>Henning</Name><Resp>None< /Resp><pics>None< /pics>< UserId.>

<rate>4<//rate><review>Awesome little ice cream shop. Creative flavors. Nice, welcoming customer staff that didn't make you feel bad for wanting to try flavors and actually encouraged tasting more. Love that they offer a super small scoop for $2.50 and beyond that the prices for high quality ice cream seem fair. The dirty south flavor with whisky, pecans, and a lush caramel swirl was my favorite. Only thing keeping it from a 5 star experience is the lack of size and amenities. Without indoor seating, water, bathrooms, etc it's hard to give a spot 5 stars even though the vibrantly colored stools outside are really chill.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x808f80adecebfbcd:0x9d9b80accfb7eda1</gmapID></record>

I really like their ice cream. Kind of a sketchy location though. When I was there some crazily dressed woman who looks like an urban gypsy snuck in the front door and grabbed a pint of ice cream out of the freezer. She then sat down in front of roam Burgers to enjoy her purloined treat</text>

<Text>I have only gotten ice cream sandwiches here because they're so good, however I would recommend the ice cream by itself any day. Little Giant's ice cream flavors are inventive and delicious.  We got a thai green curry flavor that was shocking in how wonderfully spicy and sweet it was. The cookies are great - the chocolate chip and snickerdoodles are particularly good. This place is definitely worth a visit, treat yourself before a show at the Fox!<//Text>< GmapID>

New ice cream shop that I was excited to see open in the neighborhood. Service is excellent. Ice cream needs work. Feels very beta. Textures are inconsistent and flavors are original, but don't seem to quite work. Ambitious, but falls short in execution. Good portions, but the cones are the best thing about the place.<//text>

<Text>1 star for being in my neighborhood, although that could potentially be dangerous for my waistline. My husband might have to regulate my visits.

1 star for the name and branding. Even while under construction the branding alone had me intrigued and I was counting down the days this place would be open.

1 star for the friendly scoop ninjas serving up the deliciousness.

1 star for the late hours.

And of course 1 star for the creative flavors. Dirty south is my favorite thus far.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x808f80adecebfbcd:0x9d9b80accfb7eda1<//GmapID></record>

I like the Dirty South a bit too much (though I have had a scoop of almost everything else they regularly have just to make sure it is my favorite). Really good ice cream and the staff are incredibly patient with long lines of folks who need to taste every flavor before  deciding. Om nom nom.</text>

I came here for a treat with my family after having dinner at a nearbu restaurant uptown . I felt immediately drawn in by the bright colours and friendly staff. My nephew seemed to particular enjoy the kid-sized tables and chairs. There were many flavours of ice cream to choose from that I barely knew where to begin -- I guess I began by cutting out the vegan ones lol, although it's nice to know they're there if I'm every with anyone with dietary restrictions. In the end I got a single cup (two flavours) with Nana's (ba)nana ice cream and Dirty South (I think it was called, with caramel and bourbon), which complemented each other nicely and I would highly recommend this combo. Overall, nice place with a family-friendly atmosphere and I can't wait come back for more.< /text>

I f***ing love this place. They have some really randomly unique flavors that somehow seem to satisfy my cravings. Their "nana's puddin" was amazing but I haven't seen it lately which is kind of making me sad. I  would suggest trying their "dirty South" and any of their vegan flavors as well.</review>

It's no Humphrey Slocombe but it's pretty good. Oakland is a bit of an ice cream desert so it's a welcome addition.<//Review>

Food was fresh and tasty 😋, service was awesome, it was super cheap for these delicious meals, the only thing I didn't like was when I saw waiters with very long nails<//review>

I really enjoyed my time at Chili's. I came in for a quick dinner with my roommate, there was a short wait until we were able to be seated but didn't mind waiting.

I ordered the baby back ribs and my friend ordered the fajita shrimp plate. We both enjoyed our food. We had a very friend and personable waitress Ali. She was extremely attentive making sure we were happy with our food and drinks.

We had the pleasure of being able to speak with the General Manager Conor about Chicago and places in San Diego to visit since we are new to town. He was very engaged and seemed genuinely interested in speaking and getting to know us, it was great.

Ali & Conor are definitely the reason we will return for dinner or drinks again.

Thanks for the great time and food!< /Text>

<rating>5< /rating><review>I placed my order for curbside pickup on the website. I received a text stating that I will receive another text in approximately half an hour letting me know that my order was ready to be picked up. I was in the area so I was able to get an errand done while waiting. Less than half an hour later I received the second text, arrived at the restaurant 2 minutes later, sent them a text stating that I have arrived and someone promptly brought my complete order out to my vehicle. As usual, the food from the Sports Arena location was perfectly prepared and delicious. The whole process was quick and painless just the way I like it. Just the way I love it!</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

Some of the food was over salted and some needed extra. Other than that it was a good experience. Everything was fresh and tasty. Patience, the server was very attentive and friendly. Looking forward to the cookie skillet when I get home<//Text>

Always a good experience at this restaurant. You cannot beat the 3 for $10 deal. There’s nowhere cheaper to eat.< /Review>

<Review>We go to chilis atleast 2 to 3 times a week back home so figured would go to this one, I understand seating is limited but to wait for 30mins for someone to clean a table in the bar area is a little crazy. Also service was pretty slow for not being so busy at the time of our visit.< /Review>< gmap_id>

<text>Quiet day! We were basically only ones in the restaurant.  Great service and food. Fries weren't hot but they replaced them quickly and the replacements were perfect! Had dessert to celebrate mom's birthday and it was amazing! Overall great visit.<//text>< time>

Very accessible prices, the food is real good to be fast food, either the staff offer you an excellent service, really quick and kind, they also prepare the food at the moment so when you get your dish its fresh and tasteful.< /review>

Took 30minutes past my curbside pickup time to get my food. Even then I had to go inside to request it. Dinner was cold. Then with the molten cake, the chocolate sauce was full of grease!</Review>

<review>The food is always good. The service was ok, but could've been a little faster. The restaurant wasn't packed and we still had to wait for a while to get anyone's attention to be able to pay by cash.
Still 5* for the food< /review>< UserId.>

<Review>Zero stars if I could. Came 15 miles out of my way because online it says dine in is available. I politely in as to why the rest of the San Diego locations could have accurate information, when this location did not. The manager was short and rude to me and I did not at all appreciate her demeanor, Or lack of empathy. I worked in the service industry for 5 years, it’s not that hard to do better. Perhaps it’s because she’s on salary, the bane of restaurant manager’s existence. But then again, If you hate your job, find a new one. I’m sure there’s plenty of  quality candidates who actually care about the patrons of their restaurant. Do better< /Review>< pics>

Out of three to go orders this year the last two were awful.  The last time we ordered no pink for the burger, when we got home the burger was pink and we had to re-cook it. Also the loaded mash was half of the typical order  it was greasy, and looked like they scooped out the last little bit from the pan.  Prior to this last order I had my typical order and the steak was the worst one I've ever had. Not ordering to go from here again.< /Text>

<rating>2<//rating><review>I love most Chili's restaurants, and eat there about three or four times a week. I am on the road a lot and I like to stop in at the restaurants and have a good food at a reasonable price. And typically you can get that at Chili's. However, at this location on Sports Arena you are sure to be disappointed every time you go there. I ordered the meal to go and you go in there and you are not greeted very well at all, that's to begin. The bartender is not personable and very matter-of-fact and cold, treating you like you're an imposition. When you finally get the food they come out with two small cups for the iced tea claiming they don't have a large cup. If that's the way it is, fine. But the bartender is basically not apologetic and her attitude is basically if you don't like it then go to hell! The food was cold they gave me about 12 french fries with my hamburger and you can tell the food was old even though I ordered it for a specific time. This location was always a disappointment I've tried eating here about six times. Most other locations are excellent and you don't usually get these kind of problems. Just a very odd location was probably the management I would guess.<//review>< pictures>

Nice place for tasty TexMex. Service is always awesome even when they have a full house. I will be back with my relatives. Menu is like a place in San Francisco I loved.</review>

Chilis had always been a meeting place for my family, but lately (past two months, we pick up order 3x monthly) it seems the food quality and portions have fallen dramatically but the amount seasonings have increased proportionally.</review>

Great venue. We are from New Zealand so the way the do it in the states is totally different. How ever Ben was amazing and helped us with everything. Great food even better service. Ben interacted with everybody at the table and turned a family dinner into something we will remember for the rest of our lives. Best place we dined for dinner while staying in the states. Ben kept us happy with snacks while we waited for out food. Huge portion but beautifully cooked food. Heading home to NZ but Ben will be remembered.< /text>

<Text>Came in to have a relaxing early Sunday dinner and watch some football in the bar area. A booth was available but needed to be cleaned off a bit. The young lady at the front desk took care of it right away and swept under the table too! Courtney was our server. He was attentive and very friendly. Food was good and they had great Happy Hour drink and food specials on a Sunday which was cool. We will definitely be back. 😊<//Text>< pics>

<Review>They had so many more choices on the menu in florida. I was also on base in japan and the menu was great there as well. However, this one was very small. I ordered the steak (there were only two steak options) and it just came as is. Meaning the sides in the picture is what u get. However, the food was delicious! Also had southwestern egg rolls. Delicious!</Review>< Name>

been getting a lot of food to go from this Chili's recently due to The cove in situation. I must say that all orders have been accurate and the food tastes consistent with normal Chili's dining.< /Text>

Best Chili's ive been too, ever, although I don't do chains often this one has a local neighborhood feel. This location has a great staff, they make you feel welcomed and they are very attentive with a friendly smile.  Who can beat the 3 for $10 deal! Easy comfort food that won't blow you away, but stick to the classics and you will leave with a smile and some left overs. Love!< /text>

<Review>To be honest I don't think anyone REALLY likes Chili's. It just that place you go because it is really cheap and they usually have good specials. However I do think the menu and pricing structure is more compelling than something like Applebee's.

This particular location is just okay. Service is mediocre on a slow day. The chips and salsa were especially greasy and my soup contained way more cheese than one person should eat (mind you, I am VERY pro cheese).</Review>< Date>

The side salad should be called the side ceasar dressing because I got more dressing than lettuce. It came out fast no delay there. I think it beat the drinks. Good server I'll be back</review>

<Review>location where staff makes you feel like #1 , we have been in main dining area and bar a couple times and yesterday eve in bar was great. This location is consistent  with other chili's both in how food and drinks.  Hey the manager is visible here even stops by here and there  and interacts with the patrons  alot of restaurants you don't even see a manager ( they hide in their offices ) so you know this location  cares.  Food is good, depends on what you on what you order, of course greasy foods are greasy and ribs are saucy , some people you'll never please , like my jewish mother in law she finds fault in nearly everything.   Anyways this place is overall a good choice.</Review><rate>4< /rate>< name>

<text>Could not believe the difference from when we had last visited ,ate , at this Chilis .
location.  Billy , and I had a pretty good top sirloin steak  , cooked the way we ordered it with the sides really good .There was broccoli fresh  , real potatoes  both delicious.
This time though the steaks were a better cut rib eyes we ordered and they were like utility beef blah and not too tender .Disappointed by both the food and its price did not fit , at all.
Especially , being that this brand of restarurant ,Chilis restaurant,  was the place for  one of our first dates .
And , believe me I remember , the blooming onion , living up to its name  Chilis appetizer,  the Blooming Onion , was a real hit being a new appetizer in the 1990s  to the restaurant menus .Well , I could not believe the order we received,  especially when I opened the to go box and found only pieces of the onion petals not a onion bloom ,or blooming onion opening up like a flower made of an onions layers cut into a petals...a blooming onion right.
Thought we had done something wrong or asked for their left orders and rib eyes that did not make their cut as dinner or even a breakfast steak , really.
So much to say we had both hoped for what we had come to expect from Chilis , I still feel bad  about how we were served.And wonder why such a difference , maybethe stay at home orders with no dining in delivery and to go only brought about lesser fan and fare. Well then their menu should and prices to reflect their changes and choices,  and why punish us their customers ? I would like them to put themselves in our places and the receiving end as well as ask they could cook and serve their representations they did as Chilis menu items , come on really.
No way will that type of food or service be our return to your pkace.<//text><Rating>2<//Rating><UserId.>109392215436742721721< /UserId.>< username>

This is right near the Valley View Casino Center. We sat at the bar. Just wanted to eat and watch a game. Lots of TVs. Did not like the fact they let children sit at the bar. One of many reason I sit there.
The food was great. I had the Buffalo Chicken salad and he had the Cajun Chicken Pasta. His was extremely flavorful, not too spicy. Mine was exactly what I wanted. Not lots of place do this salad..
As an appetizer we had the cheddar fries. Perfect amount before our meal.
Reasonably priced and service was good, even as busy as they were, will come back again.< /review>

< Review>
I've tried this Chili's many times over the years.  The steaks are greyish not brown with pink or red centers. They have no real beef flavor besides the seasoning.  Probably frozen.  Ribs are ok.  Salads are ok.  Drinks are fair for a chain restaurant.  The happy hour food menu lacks.    Bartenders are either great or full of themselves, depending on who's on shift. If your visiting, try one of the many non-franchise bar and grills around the area.</Review>

Tasty portions and too much to eat in one setting.  My son said beer was sour, but his  Jameson's was good.  My BlackBerry margarita  was good although a bit too salty.

As usual staff were wonderful.  There went needed, but not intrusive otherwise.</Text>

I typically love Chili's. Lately the service has been slipping. The food was like warm and they brought our lunch before the appetizers. My black bean burger was awesome though, even though it wasn't hot.<//Text>

We ordered the 2 for 25$ meal deal they have going, at first we weren't even going to order that, but she told us the portions were the exact same, which was super nice. Definitely worth every penny.

Noticed everyone around us were offered free chips & salsa but us. Didn't want to make a big deal because I didn't want anything "done" to our meal while waiting for it. Otherwise, food was decent. I guess I shouldn't be surprised since  most of the patrons weren't that ethnically diverse. Being how I look I should be used to it...<//Review>

I enjoying going to Chili's go all the time in Columbia MO and Independence mo first time here it was the worst experience I ever had at a Chili's restaurant, I know that we are social distancing but the hosts left us outside another couple walked in and was seated first we have been outside for more than a 30 minutes plenty of tables open, so I was like ok clearly this was just a mistake but then we order our food and it takes more than 50 minutes to get our meal even the appetizer very disappointed</review>

Great service! Tasty adult drinks! My 4-yr-old son did a little "Michael Jackson" dance for the hostess, and in his words... "she was a little bit pretty and a lot beautiful." Keep up the good work Chili's!</review>

I eat here twice a week mainly for the happy hour.  The food is ok if you get what you ordered, but the service is slow and they act like there is no rush to greet you or even acknowledge you.  The managers are lazy and stand around in the back leaning against the wall or expo line when people need to be seated or employees need help.</text>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><Rating>1<//Rating><review>Man, what's happened to Chili's lately?  A lot of these chain restaurants seem to all be going to the dumps lately.  I went here with my two sisters and their family, so the party was about 9 including three kids.  The servers kept insisting that they have a "team effort" when tending to customers but even as I stared at three other tables waiting in our area for refills, take out boxes, or even a check - I had enough and told several people that it just didn't work.

What was worse was that our server kept trying to explain it to us ... you shouldn't have to explain how service works.  You get service or you don't, it's as easy at that.

The food was too salty which didn't help that we couldn't get our drinks refilled until we finally got our check.  The chicken enchilada soup I used to crave was thick and came out warm at best.. I was just shocked.  Yes there was a decent night, but I literally watched my phone to see when we'd see someone come back to our area and it was nearly 15 minutes before anyone did.  It's like the staff all decided to have a meeting or go on break together because three or four of them popped out laughing from back.  Food came out in such strange patterns.  You would expect drinks, to appetizers, to salads, to entrees, to dessert.  But they all came at us in different times, by different people, and varying temperatures.  It was sooo slow.  I believe after getting our water, some of our drinks came out after two appetizers arrived, then after the last appetizer arrived with salads, we got the last few drinks for people.  Refills?  Forget about it!

I absolutely loathe this kind of service and will never go again.  Hopefully they figure out it wasn't working and go back to the tried and true assigned stations.  It works for every other chain, ma 'n pa, hole in the wall, eatery, and fine dining restaurant Chili's.   This "group/team" service is a mess and all we got as customers are... excuses.</review><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x80deaafaf26476fd:0x32e9a16c2196b626< /Gmap_id><time>1529787839609<//time><user_name>Robbie Baquiran</user_name></record></dataset><record>

The service was awful. I waited over 5 minutes for my waiter to greet me and take my drinks. The food came out quick, but was delivered by someone else. When my waiter came to check on me, she walked past me before I could respond. Good thing I didn't need a box or anything, because there was no one in sight to ask, and my drink was never refilled.

The best part of the service was the hostess. At least the food was good< /review>

< Review>
This location is our go to when we want to eat out and not spend a crazy amount. The service is usually great, all the servers are usually super friendly and always around to help. The food is always great! Never a miss! BUT today we had a let down with the service. I asked the server if I could have a side of Mac and cheese for my little one year old considering she doesn't eat much and I don't need a full kids meal. The server said yeah no problem. Aside from her constant absence from out table, and literally only showing back up to bring our food even tho we asked for different things like ranch and Tabasco that we had to bother a separate server for, she neglected to mention that the "side" of Mac and cheese is in fact just the kids Mac and cheese without the side and drink- you're still paying for the kids meal price. Low and behold when I look at the check that we are being charged for a second kids meal! I bring this to the attention of the manager who doesn't really do much other than explain that there really is a side of what we ordered and then proceeds to do nothing to rectify this. It was disappointing because we always come to this location and we've received much more knowledgeable service other times. I hope that someone reads this from that location and decides to retrain the staff. Then I can rate it a full five stars.</Review>

Hit this place before going into the hockey game.  I sipped on a whiskey and ate Texas fries and buffalo wings with my buddy during Happy Hour. The place was packed and loud and the staff handled the craze like bosses! Awesome team! I'd like to see more plant based protein options in the near future.<//Text>

The parking was hard to get into. The service was very poor, almost seemed like our server was in bad mood.

I felt slightly ignored by our waiter but in his defense he had a VERY annoying and demanding patron at the table next to us.  He probably felt that he had not given us the attention we deserved because he gave us 2 kids meal comps coupons for our next visit.
The menu said that the guacamole was fresh yet when I asked for no jalapenos in my guacamole, I was told it came already pre-mixed. News flash - that is NOT fresh!
We ordered 2 molten lava cakes. One had a chunk of bacon in it. I showed it to the girl who delivered the molten lava cakes to the table and to the waiter. A new cake was offered but we had already removed the bacon and started eating the cake.
It took a long time for refills and for ranch dressing to finally be delivered to us...as previously mentioned, I believe that the waiter was dealing with a high maintenance customer at the table beside us.<//Text>

Always hot, delicious, and at a great price! Super fun and friendly staff always make sure you get your order just right and if you don't like what you get, they will make it right with no delay. Also, in my opinion, they have THE BEST ribs EVER! Way better than Phil's barbecue for sure!!</Text>

<Text>Service was horrible. Went with a party of 9. It was not super busy, but multiple servers still managed to mess up.  One person with my party received their meal before appetizers and salad. Then we received wrong or messed up orders which had cold food. Then had to wait over ten minutes for a manager.</Text>< rating>

Worst bartending service we have ever experienced.  He was blowing his on several occasions and not even washings his hands after, not paying attention to customers and all of his attention was to 2 girls in the corner getting them drunk. I was trying to order my food and he cut me off to answer to one of the girls joke. Then one of the servers was very rude to some different customers in the bar area. Screaming that she had bad news . This happened on Monday night. Never going back again.<//review>

The food came out really quick and the service was phenomenal.  The music needed to be turned down a little bit, but it was a great place to take my family out. Very close to San Diego attractions and easy to get to. Plenty of parking.<//Text>

<review>There food is different from times. What I mean is that one time I had breaded chicken fingers and they were so good that a week later went back in and ordered the same thing but this time the breading was extremely hard and the chicken was dry. The fries are also sometimes good and sometimes not.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<Response>None</Response><review>I dont have words for how good the food was,  that was not what brought this down to three stars, and i want no one reading this to assume their food isn't up to par because it was some of the best I've ever had. The reason this review is three stars instead of five is their cleanliness is not what i expected. My menus were sticky and gross and the tables hadn't been cleaned. (This issue was rectified). Though this does not excuse them for being dirty.<//review>< Date>

Service was horrible. Won't be back to that location. Manager was nice though.
EDIT:
Management reached out to me based on my experience which was unexpected and appreciated. Thanks for taking the time. I will be changing my rating.</review>

Review from 3/2/18 around 2pm. The server was very nice. However, other employees kept her distracted and the service was extremely slow. We ordered drinks and they took forever. I ordered the chips, salad & soup and my bf just ordered chili. That also took an abnormally long amount of time to receive and she never even brought me my soup! I had to have her take it off the bill. Overall, very disappointing.</Text>

Worst service EVER. I suspect it was due to the location. Right next to the San Diego Sports Arena. We came in 30mins before last call on alcohol and felt rushed to finish, not even enjoy our food. Our server was cold in demeanor and so were the rest of the staff. Any other location has always been solid. Very unfortunate.</text>

<Review>One of our favorite afternoon evening weekend dining spots. Close to the marina. Easy place to beat the heat during the summer. Excellent food! Big fans of the carnitas tacos. We order them with double broccoli for a good solid low glycemic meal.<//Review>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Just went in for the first time today. VERY friendly staff. I ordered a "to go" full ribs meal and the girl behind the bar was sweet. The meal took a while, I didn't mind bc I was not in a rush, but the chef gave me a free cheesecake slice to compensate me. I told her it wasn't necessary but she said that she wanted to do so because of the wait. THAT is excellent customer service and I will DEFINITELY be back! Two thumbs up 👍👍 Oh yeah, the food was excellent and the cheesecake was de-lish!!!! 🤗<//Review><gmap_id>0x80deaafaf26476fd:0x32e9a16c2196b626</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Simple, classic yummy. Only 4 because the meals are generic, but they are truly delicious. Waitress was nice, food was served quicky, the vibe was casual, full bar, TV's, and did I mention good food? Lol< /review>

<Text>I worked here, and was terminated in a discriminatory manner due to my mental disability, even after confessing in the most stable manner that I could, about what was going on with me. I even explained to one of the managers Riah (if that's how you spell her name) that I was willing to gather the papers based on my disability. I can't collect SSI, because I believe that people with more detrimental conditions deserve that slice of the cake from the government. Honestly, what can I say, it was a dishwashing job at one of the most poorly run places that I've ever worked at, but I'm sure I can try and fight this. The way that I was treated from the beginning was totally uncalled for.</Text>< GmapID>

There is a sign in their TO-GO area that states: "See the Bartender; To place to-go orders and for life coaching."
That night, the bar maid needed some coaching herself on people skills.</review>

<Review>Standard experience from the dense in terms of food.

Service was insanely slow. Ordered and often food wasn't coming for over 45 minutes which is odd considering how few people were there.

Worked for us, killing time before a delayed flight but if this was a date I'd be really annoyed.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x80deaafaf26476fd:0x32e9a16c2196b626</GmapID></record>

Well not eating here if you are told to sit anywhere by one employer then another scolds you for doing so. Jo/John/ Gio what ever his name was, we just got there and you spoil the hunger from people, if you dont like working there get another job.< /review>

They put their happy hour online and menus as three levels of beer specials the top-level being super premium !
But when we went by for happy hour they had all of the best beers not included at any level.  If you enjoy a decent quality beer stay away from this place as they are very deceptive in claiming that six of their beers do not fall in the category of regular, premium or even superpremium.</text>

Showed up and they took forever to take an order because a lady was looking at the menu and taking forever asking about different discounts to see if she could take advantage,so we decided to order online so we wouldn't have to wait. They didn't accept our coupon, and they barely gave my wife the full amount of chicken strips like most chilis do, they seemed to microwave the chicken bacon quesadilla instead of grilling/frying it like all the other locations I've been too, the sauce was less then half way filled up which sucks because it's really good in my opinion :/ based on the this experience among others it's seems like cali doesn't care much about customers like most places I've been too, they seem to care more about getting people out then getting the order right and they seem to have attitude because either there conceded or they thing they're better then all the people around them and this is based on other restaurant too.......<//Text>

Some Chili's (most in my opinion) suck in regards to food quality and service, not so with this one.
I have correlated the sucky ones being near hotels.  It seems that they figure the customer base is transient and being close to a hotel people will come in.< /review>

The Chili's located at 3494 Sports Arena Blvd, San Diego, CA 92110 is a God Damn disgrace to the franchise. Though it once had good food and service, in the last 3 years it has turned into the most screwed up location. I use to frequent it often, but after 12 different problems in 3 years, I avoid it. And I publically advise people not to go to it. Bad service, inconsistent food quality and preparation, food order mistakes, long wait times to place "To Go" orders, all these things have occurred constantly and repeatedly, and though the management has been advise, the trend continues. The service at this location is so bad, that the locations at Mission Valley, Poway, and La Mesa are preferable despite being nearly 30 mins further away. If Chili's Corporate values it's reputation, it will close the location since it cannot obviously be fixed no matter how many times problems are brought to the management's attention.</text>

I've been to this Chili's just once and never again, My boyfriend and I got the guacamole and salsa dip for an appetizer and everything was very salty, the guac was sour like if it was bad already. I ordered the fish and rice, the fish was horrible, it was old and smelly. Fish is not suppose to be brown in the middle..... I worked at a fish market and I know my fresh fish. My bf had steak and potatoes, the steak was tiny and the mash potatoes were served in a rusty steel pan or whatever it was. Worst place to go out and eat......</Text>

We love Chillis and their chicken enchilada soup! yet at this branch ot is way to watery with very little chicken, we now order from the Clairemount Franchise,, two days ago we rode our bikes to sports arena area and decided to go eat at Chillis there at sports arena, i ordered the baby back ribs, the ribs were dry hard to eat definitely did not fall of the bone, i took them back, they where nice to cook me a new set, but the new set was the same all dry! either they get terrible ribs or the cook has no idea how to cook them. I think i will stick with Outback their ribs are always great. the Chillis soup comes already made in a plastic bag, i don't know how it could be different then from the other Chillis unless they are on purpose watering it down. Please don't judge Chillis on the food cooked at the sports arena branch.. every where else it is great food! We will now just eat at the Clairemount branch..<//review>

Ordered two big and spendy burgers. Got home to find that they left out 3 of the toppings for my burger. My burger ended up being just a plain regular one that i over paid for. Not happy.< /Review>

Currently on a trend of great employees with great service.  Caution, this location is inside a parking lot for the Valley View Casino Arena which makes parking difficult on busy nights that have a popular show or game.</Review>
