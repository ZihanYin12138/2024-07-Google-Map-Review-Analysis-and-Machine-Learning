At first, kind and seemed helpful. Then, a strange thing happened,  voice changed from the representative, and just was different towards Me.Pondered, what, cautioned the employee, and cautioned Me as a, "Legitimate Citizen, as a, "Consumer Client!" Actually, I'm fortunate, because this saved Me from, paying a higher cost of furniture, than If I just paid full price, and right up front, In the beginning....Thank you, Aaron, & Ms.Manager, have a better day!
Sincerely;
Ms.LenaMae&<My dog Peache's!</Review>

<Review>I have never had any problems with Aaron's, They are so kind and on time with everything. I have purchased a washer, and now the top of the line laptop. I will continue to buy from them, as do most of my family members.

Thank you Aaron's for such great service.

Pamela a happy customer.</Review>< username>

<Text>I've never been there, but someone used my name to purchase something from this store and then apparently didn't pay for it.  The store has been told this by me several times as well as the fact that I live in another state, yet they keep hassling me about it.  I need to focus on fighting my cancer and heart problems, not this nonsense.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Long story short. My Fiance and I were living with his brother. They had I guess been renting a furniture set from aarons. When we had just moved in aarons had came to take there furniture because they had not made payments. They came and my brother in law was not there so my fiance called his brother he didn't answer. He said he couldn't let them in without his permission.  Anyways we got ahold of him he gave permission for them to take the furniture.  A couple months go by, we get our own place. My Fiance and I go to aarons to try and rent a tv. While we were filling out papers the manager said he recognized my fiance from when they went to pick up his brothers stuff so we said yeah it was us not thinking it would matter cause we are totally different people. Anyways we filled out the papers && gave him the $47 down for the TV. He said he will have it delivered the next day around 4-7. So we go home excited that were gonna get a TV For our living room made room and everything. The next day comes it's about 5 and my fiance calls them and asks about what time will they be dropping the TV off. The manager gets on the phone and says that he didn't get approved because of his brothers credit. And that being he was there at his brothers and didn't open the door he can't rent to us. MIND YOU WE HAD JUST MOVED THERE, DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON, GOING BY WHAT HE'S BROTHERS RULES WHERE. So because his brothers credit was bad they can't rent to us.? So we go to another aarons close by and they tell us they can't rent to us because the manager at the other one called them and said for them not to rent to us.. So NO SCREW AARONS!!!!</text>

Buyer beware! The people at Aaron's act like a bunch of loan sharks, banging on my door and leaving notices for someone who doesn't even live at my address. I've tried calling them to get them to stop, but they won't stop harassing me. I've never done business with them and never will at this point.< /text>

<text>(Translated by Google) I don't know how the service will be, but the truth is that 24 hours do NOT work. On Saturday at 11pm I needed to have 2 emergency tires repaired, I arrived at the place and it was closed. Dial the 2 numbers that are written there and nobody ever answered. And thankfully, the local says they work 24 hours and is totally false. To place false information ???? DO NOT WORK 24 HOURS

(Original)
No se que tal será el servicio, pero lo cierto es que 24 horas NO trabajan. El sábado a las 11pm necesitaba que me repararan 2 llantas de emergencia, llegue al lugar y estaba cerrado. Marque los 2 números que allí tienen escrito y nunca nadie contestó. Y menos mal que en el local dice que trabajan 24 horas y es totalmente falso. Para que colocan información falsa ???? NO TRABAJAN 24 HORAS< /text></record>

Words CANNOT explain how much I loved this pizza! It was so fluffy and had a crunch to it, and it just tasted so good!
I was able to feed 8-9 people with just 2 pizzas! And I still had some extra left👏😂 I really recommend this place! Such high quality and the customer service was great as well!😁<//Text>

Good customer service. Pizzas are $6.00 with one topping of your choice 👍... Really good for my budget.. Before visiting the beach..<//Review>

Amazing pizza the dough is so fresh! My niece loves this place so much! It's the only pizza place we go to and it's very affordable! They already know us as regular customers. Must try and way better than Pizza Hut or Domino's.< /text>

The dishes are always fresh and tasty, the service towards the guests  is efficient. I often go to  this restaurant and I was never unsatisfied. I recommend this place.<//text>< gmap_id>

Visited today for the first time. Bought 3 large pizzas (pepperoni, buffalo chicken, and supreme), cheese sticks and wings (spicy korean and bbq). I am honestly not impressed. The price is good, but to me, for its flavor, it is not worth it. I don't think I will be returning. I still prefer OTHER pizza parlors. This place was just OK.<//Review>

This is my first time trying Asap Pizza. The pizza deserves five stars because their prices are very reasonable. The dough was fresh and they’re  definitely in competition  with other pizza parlors.</Review>

<text>Nadia is the best, hands down. I will not trust anyone to touch my face except her. She is so thorough and so good at what she does. Since I've been coming to Nadia regularly, my skin has noticeably improved, it looks more nourished, cleaner, hydrated, younger. I receive comments from my coworkers and family, they notice the change in my skin and ask what I've been doing differently.

What I like about Nadia is she's very honest and so sweet.
Her place is so clean, every time I come to see her, she never disappoints; always provides the best quality work. I look forward to my facials every month. Love her!</text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>{'time': 1583460970901, 'text': 'Thank you for your kind words and i am so please to know that you are happy with the post treatment results we could not have succeeded for over 6 years if it was not for our  satisfied clients.'}<//resp>< GmapID>

My experience was just perfect I initially booked 2 different treatments and shortly got a call from Nadya telling me it is not a good idea to do 2 treatments back to back. That what I call honesty,  before I would go to big spa hotels and it was just buy this do this and keep selling me expensive useless products. But not with Nadya she took her time and explain to me step by step of the treatment, she also told me I was buying too much products and it was actually hurting my skin. In all my years my skin has not been as great as when I began my treatment with Nadya. She is simply the best l recommend her for anybody that is seeking to have the best possible skin treatment</review>

<text>When you find someone great to trust your skin and face, no matter what season is outside:)
Nadya delivers results and is very passionate about the care she provides to you as a client. I’ve been coming for skin treatments for a good 4 years now and tried almost everything that she had to offer from her menu. Love the up to date machines she uses,  skin care products and masks are top quality!  Plus , the bed is so comfy, fresh sheets ...you feel  cosy and relaxed. You can change into gown and get under the blanket or choose not too, its up to you.

At the beginning I was a bit skeptical but very curious about chemical peels. But after thorough consultation Nadya explained to me which one will be safe and is best to use for my skin type. Also, I learned that fall/winter is the best time for chemical peels as air gets cooler, sun is less strong,etc.So I proceeded adding LED light at the end that helped to calm the skin in minutes. So cool! I was expecting to see my skin super red after the procedure but it was just pink and did not feel over sensitive or abrasive.

I did all the after peel care Nadya told me to do at home and my new skin appear so smooth, healthy looking and few freckles got lighter!

Thank you Nadya!!< /text>< pictures>

Always looking forward to get my treatment with Nadya. She is very knowledgeable about skin, also she is amazing person to talk to. I live in New York but come to LA often, every my trip I make sure I do make my appointment, so my skin feels flawless after a long flight. She uses most modern modalities and European skin care lines. Also I do get my spray tan, she have the best organic solutions and color comes out perfect. Cant wait for my next trip and my appointment with you Nadya. Thanks a lot</Text>

< Review>
Ever since middle school I've struggled with acne. For years, my skin was one of my biggest insecurities and depleted me of any confidence that I used to have. Once I decided to go to Nadya and get the anti-acne facial, my face was cleared from years of pigmentation and scars after a few sessions and my confidence was fully restored. She offers really affordable prices, quality service and a very relaxing environment. I definitely recommend you go to her. In the picture below, on the left side, I had multiple under-the-skin pimples during the summer of 2020. On the right side of the photo is me after a few anti-acne facials and chemical peels with Nadya. My skin is doing much better now as Nadya is always well prepared to treat all types of acne.</Review>

Nadya is absolutely great: very professional, truly cares about the long term result of her work and provides customized skin care without selling unnecessary and heavy procedures and products. I did various skin cleaning procedures and always leave her salon feeling refreshed and bright.< /Text>

<text>I don't normally write Yelp reviews but this is worth it! I have never had a facial and was warned by friends that I would be in extreme pain. That wasn't the case with Nadya. Her technique was great and made sure I was comfortable during my session. I will definitely be back and the location is perfect.

Already referred all my friends!
Great experience !< /text>< pictures>

Nadya was fantastic. I got the best anti acne facial with LED light therapy from her. She is an excellent practitioner, and she was very sensitive to my needs. I was very conscious about it and she took great care of me.< /Text>

I'm so glad I found Nadya!!! I've been to many different places for facials but never felt compelled to leave a review or keep going back for more treatments. I have gone to her regularly now for facials, micro dermabrasion and chemical peels since December 2016. I have made facials a regular part of my skin care and I always look forward to going back to Nadya. My skin looks and feels great as a result of the amazing work she has done. She is super gentle and does a great job at always leaving my skin with a healthy glow. I highly recommend Nadya, she will not disappoint!< /Review>

I love Nadya's skin care. As a die-hard Eastsider it takes a lot to get me to travel this far west but Nadya's facials are totally worth it.  The micro current facials are the best, I used to feel like I needed extra makeup to perk up my skin but I feel confident bare-faced after just two of Nadya's facials.  Nadya is great, friendly, professional, and keeps skin care simple and low maintenance.  I'm a skin product junkie and we paired down my routine and I saw even better results.  If you want to take your facial game to a whole new level go see Nadya ;)< /text>

My Fiance and I were on vacation in L.A. and I treated my lady to a full spa day with the owner of Nadyas Skin Care who really took care of us. Very nice facility and Nadya really knows her stuff. Lots of Awards on her walls made me feel confident that my lady was in for a treat. We will be back on our next vacation to L.A. Thanks again.<//Text>

<review>As a teen who has struggled with acne for over 3 years, I can finally say that I have never felt more confident about my skin than I do now. Nadya is one of the most understanding and intelligent women I have ever met, and she really knows what she's doing. I remember when I went in for my first pca peel, she sat down with me and we talked thoroughly about any problems I had concerning my skin, and what steps we needed to take in order to fix those problems. Although I've only had 2 pca peels, I have seen an improvement in the texture of my skin, but I still have a long way to go with the hyperpigmentation. I will 100% keep seeing Nadya. She's amazing!</review></record>

Love, love, love all my facials from Nadya!

Highly recommend to try her out for the following reasons:

[1]  Very positive, friendly and warm personality: she very much so cares about all her clients, and always delivers great results no matter if it's early or late evening appointment.

[2] High Standards: As esthetician, Nadya is exceptionally professional and thorough, uses only good quality products like organic " Eminence", "PCA",etc to name  a few.

[3] European touch : something different and very pleasant...You will feel it through Nadya's hands when she works on your skin.

[4] Well kept, clean, beautiful, relaxing skin care studio with comfortable bed and luxe linens.

[5] Excellent price menu to choose from. Best value for the best facial!
My facial treatments usually in a range of $ 60-85 plus tip.

Although, parking in Westwood could be a bit complicated but with Validation for only $2 for 2 hours you keep your car safe inside Trader Joes parking structure right across the street.<//Text>

<Text>I don't normally write Yelp reviews but this is worth it! I have never had a facial and was warned by friends that I would be in extreme pain. That wasn't the case with Nadya. Her technique was great and made sure I was comfortable during my session. I will definitely be back and the location is perfect.

Already referred all my friends!

Ever since middle school I've struggled with acne. For years, my skin was one of my biggest insecurities and depleted me of any confidence that I used to have. Once I decided to go to Nadya and get the anti-acne facial, my face was cleared from years of pigmentation and scars after a few sessions and my confidence was fully restored. She offers really affordable prices, quality service and a very relaxing environment. I definitely recommend you go to her. In the picture below, on the left side, I had multiple under-the-skin pimples during the summer of 2020. On the right side of the photo is me after a few anti-acne facials and chemical peels with Nadya. My skin is doing much better now as Nadya is always well prepared to treat all types of acne.</text>

<review>Nadya is by far the best esthetician I have ever had. I had an acne facial (I'm an active 22yo male) with added microdermabrasion, and the actual facial process proved really enjoyable. Her methods are very thorough but also gentle. She performed every extraction without any discomfort from me--which I have never experienced before. Her knowledge is also unparalleled--her world-class esthetician education is clear in the way she explains what she's applying to your skin, and how it will work.

She also took a lot of time before the actual facial to get to know my skin, and learn about my routine, so she could best tailor the facial to my skin's individual traits.

After only four days, my skin is almost perfectly clear. In fact, it's as clear as it's ever been. I'm looking forward to going back, and intend to make her my only esthetician.< /review>< Pics>

My Mom and I had dual facials. I would highly recommend this spa. It is med spa  but still has the relaxing spa atmosphere. They have their own products of which I will buy after I use up what I have now. They are informative but not pushy. We left relaxed and glowing!<//Text>

Nadia is the best, hands down. I will not trust anyone to touch my face except her. She is so thorough and so good at what she does. Since I've been coming to Nadia regularly, my skin has noticeably improved, it looks more nourished, cleaner, hydrated, younger. I receive comments from my coworkers and family, they notice the change in my skin and ask what I've been doing differently.

What I like about Nadia is she's very honest and so sweet.
Her place is so clean, every time I come to see her, she never disappoints; always provides the best quality work. I look forward to my facials every month. Love her!<//text>

< review>
My experience was just perfect I initially booked 2 different treatments and shortly got a call from Nadya telling me it is not a good idea to do 2 treatments back to back. That what I call honesty,  before I would go to big spa hotels and it was just buy this do this and keep selling me expensive useless products. But not with Nadya she took her time and explain to me step by step of the treatment, she also told me I was buying too much products and it was actually hurting my skin. In all my years my skin has not been as great as when I began my treatment with Nadya. She is simply the best l recommend her for anybody that is seeking to have the best possible skin treatment<//review>

<text>When you find someone great to trust your skin and face, no matter what season is outside:)
Nadya delivers results and is very passionate about the care she provides to you as a client. I’ve been coming for skin treatments for a good 4 years now and tried almost everything that she had to offer from her menu. Love the up to date machines she uses,  skin care products and masks are top quality!  Plus , the bed is so comfy, fresh sheets ...you feel  cosy and relaxed. You can change into gown and get under the blanket or choose not too, its up to you.

At the beginning I was a bit skeptical but very curious about chemical peels. But after thorough consultation Nadya explained to me which one will be safe and is best to use for my skin type. Also, I learned that fall/winter is the best time for chemical peels as air gets cooler, sun is less strong,etc.So I proceeded adding LED light at the end that helped to calm the skin in minutes. So cool! I was expecting to see my skin super red after the procedure but it was just pink and did not feel over sensitive or abrasive.

I did all the after peel care Nadya told me to do at home and my new skin appear so smooth, healthy looking and few freckles got lighter!

Thank you Nadya!!< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< rating>

My Mom and I had dual facials. I would highly recommend this spa. It is med spa  but still has the relaxing spa atmosphere. They have their own products of which I will buy after I use up what I have now. They are informative but not pushy. We left relaxed and glowing!</text>

< review>
Always looking forward to get my treatment with Nadya. She is very knowledgeable about skin, also she is amazing person to talk to. I live in New York but come to LA often, every my trip I make sure I do make my appointment, so my skin feels flawless after a long flight. She uses most modern modalities and European skin care lines. Also I do get my spray tan, she have the best organic solutions and color comes out perfect. Cant wait for my next trip and my appointment with you Nadya. Thanks a lot< /review>

What a gift this was. Her room is so relaxing and she is a very sweet, caring and knowledgeable. I really enjoyed my time with her. I almost fell asleep)))) She told me a little bit about what she was doing with each step. She really knows her stuff and a line which Nadya carries is a wonderful product and keeps my skin looking hydrated and youthful. Recommend her to all, even the men!< /text>< Pictures>

<review>Ever since middle school I've struggled with acne. For years, my skin was one of my biggest insecurities and depleted me of any confidence that I used to have. Once I decided to go to Nadya and get the anti-acne facial, my face was cleared from years of pigmentation and scars after a few sessions and my confidence was fully restored. She offers really affordable prices, quality service and a very relaxing environment. I definitely recommend you go to her. In the picture below, on the left side, I had multiple under-the-skin pimples during the summer of 2020. On the right side of the photo is me after a few anti-acne facials and chemical peels with Nadya. My skin is doing much better now as Nadya is always well prepared to treat all types of acne.< /review><Gmap_id>0x80c2bc81710df379:0x873287b12b411cfe</Gmap_id>< Name>

Nadya is absolutely great: very professional, truly cares about the long term result of her work and provides customized skin care without selling unnecessary and heavy procedures and products. I did various skin cleaning procedures and always leave her salon feeling refreshed and bright.<//review>

I'm so glad I found Nadya!!! I've been to many different places for facials but never felt compelled to leave a review or keep going back for more treatments. I have gone to her regularly now for facials, micro dermabrasion and chemical peels since December 2016. I have made facials a regular part of my skin care and I always look forward to going back to Nadya. My skin looks and feels great as a result of the amazing work she has done. She is super gentle and does a great job at always leaving my skin with a healthy glow. I highly recommend Nadya, she will not disappoint!</text>

I love Nadya's skin care. As a die-hard Eastsider it takes a lot to get me to travel this far west but Nadya's facials are totally worth it.  The micro current facials are the best, I used to feel like I needed extra makeup to perk up my skin but I feel confident bare-faced after just two of Nadya's facials.  Nadya is great, friendly, professional, and keeps skin care simple and low maintenance.  I'm a skin product junkie and we paired down my routine and I saw even better results.  If you want to take your facial game to a whole new level go see Nadya ;)<//text>

I've done a facial and two chemical peels so far. Absolutely loved the results and how Nadia walks you through the process. She will also follow up with you to see how your a skin is doing after a treatment. She'll give professional products to take care of your skin at home that will last you for a very long time. I would never be able to go to anyone else because Nadia's set the standard high</Text>

My Fiance and I were on vacation in L.A. and I treated my lady to a full spa day with the owner of Nadyas Skin Care who really took care of us. Very nice facility and Nadya really knows her stuff. Lots of Awards on her walls made me feel confident that my lady was in for a treat. We will be back on our next vacation to L.A. Thanks again.<//Review>

< Review>
As a teen who has struggled with acne for over 3 years, I can finally say that I have never felt more confident about my skin than I do now. Nadya is one of the most understanding and intelligent women I have ever met, and she really knows what she's doing. I remember when I went in for my first pca peel, she sat down with me and we talked thoroughly about any problems I had concerning my skin, and what steps we needed to take in order to fix those problems. Although I've only had 2 pca peels, I have seen an improvement in the texture of my skin, but I still have a long way to go with the hyperpigmentation. I will 100% keep seeing Nadya. She's amazing!< /Review>

<Review>Love, love, love all my facials from Nadya!

Highly recommend to try her out for the following reasons:

[1]  Very positive, friendly and warm personality: she very much so cares about all her clients, and always delivers great results no matter if it's early or late evening appointment.

[2] High Standards: As esthetician, Nadya is exceptionally professional and thorough, uses only good quality products like organic " Eminence", "PCA",etc to name  a few.

[3] European touch : something different and very pleasant...You will feel it through Nadya's hands when she works on your skin.

[4] Well kept, clean, beautiful, relaxing skin care studio with comfortable bed and luxe linens.

[5] Excellent price menu to choose from. Best value for the best facial!
My facial treatments usually in a range of $ 60-85 plus tip.

Although, parking in Westwood could be a bit complicated but with Validation for only $2 for 2 hours you keep your car safe inside Trader Joes parking structure right across the street.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>{'time': 1583463454183, 'text': 'Thank you for your generous and kind comments it is my pleasure to be of service to you'}<//resp>< GmapID>

Nadya is by far the best esthetician I have ever had. I had an acne facial (I'm an active 22yo male) with added microdermabrasion, and the actual facial process proved really enjoyable. Her methods are very thorough but also gentle. She performed every extraction without any discomfort from me--which I have never experienced before. Her knowledge is also unparalleled--her world-class esthetician education is clear in the way she explains what she's applying to your skin, and how it will work.

She also took a lot of time before the actual facial to get to know my skin, and learn about my routine, so she could best tailor the facial to my skin's individual traits.

After only four days, my skin is almost perfectly clear. In fact, it's as clear as it's ever been. I'm looking forward to going back, and intend to make her my only esthetician.< /review>

The whole pizzas are better quality than slices. All and all this is a good place to get decent food. Simple menu at low prices.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

I have always thought delicious fresh pizza. But the other day I went and ordered a whole pizza and it was the worst worst worst ever. The sauce was watered down. Made the whole experience and 10.00 terrible. I was the last pizza of the day and when I got home my dough was soggy and sauce watered down. When I went back the next day and I called first to tell him, when I went back he said there's sauce on there. I said no it's not. It's so watered down and tasted like cardboard. He would not refund my money or make a new one and it set it down for the homeless to eat the 3/4 of a pizza left. It was terrible and I let with a sour taste and never ever will I go back.</Review>

Pizza is ok, cheap, and quick. Delivery driver will give you attitude if you dont give a good tip or any tip at all. I know they adjust their prices based on pick up or delivery. Fix your drivers attitude and he may get a good tip.</Text>

I think the pizza is good (for California) and you can't beat the price, or how fast it is (~15 mins). They deliver to Alameda.<//review>

It's a little store that has a little bit of a bunch of stuff on the little town of Sheridan just of highway 65. It's convenient for those on long drives in need of a pit stop.< /Text>

<Text>Manager Christian is the most personable, professional, kind and excellent conversationalist. He looks out for what you need, makes terrific recommendations and I am Always satisfied!!! It’s nice to chat and ask about his girls at home too! Their dad is one cool person with an outstanding personality and down to earth goodness exuded. Thanks Christian for being stellar and also fun! I always enjoy coming to see this shop. Also Jose is phenomenal at what he does as an ASE technician! Jose is friendly and welcoming also to name a few.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>{'time': 1616689562378, 'text': "We appreciate the feedback, Rebecca!

Wow.  Best experience I've ever had at a shop, hands down.  I was on a road trip, broke down, and they had me back up and running within 3 hours.  Their communication and professionalism were remarkable.  This is the first review I've ever written on any business.  Lester and his crew are top notch!  Exceptional service from exceptional people.
I am very grateful - without their help I would have been stuck there until at least Friday

Thank you my angel’s🙏

My wife took her car to the Meineke in Fallbrook for an oil change. She had a coupon that we received in the mail. The coupon was for a $69 oil change, including a vehicle inspection and tire rotation. They refused to include the tire rotation. Wanted to charge her an additional $30 to rotate the tires. Said they are an independently owned store and did not have to honor the coupon and added another $5 to the costs of the oil change. Won't be going back!< /text>

<review>Chris was awesome. Helped me find my phone when I thought I left it in my car. Replaced filter that needed it but allowed me to make that choice without pressure. AAA pricing was appreciated. All in all my  car is driving better now and they made my oil change quick and easy with no appointment< /review>< resp>

< Review>
We will never do business with the Meineke in Fallbrook again.  We left our automobile with the shop early on a Friday to check out a idling issue. They never touched the car for 4 days till I called and complained midway on Monday.  I came in to speak with them on Monday afternoon and said they found no issues but charged me $150 diagnostic!  Done!  Never again. Pathetic service from the manager and the staff.  Horrible customer service!</Review>

I’ve been going to this Meinike for some time now, they’re always so pleasant and helpful. I’ve always sat and waited for the service instead of dropping off my vehicle and they get me out of there in a timely matter. I appreciate them for squeezing me in most times.< /review>

<Review>I usually use Meineke for the oil changes on my 350Z but they also put in a clutch which feels better than my newer car!  No pressure to add services but Mike did give me a quote on tires more than $200 less than competitors.  I have used them for four years and trust their work and that it is also at a good price.< /Review>< pictures>

I'm so happy that Meineke ended up being friendly, trustworthy, inexpensive and now my wife and I have been taking your cars to them for the last  year 1/2. I am very satisfied and will be a dedicated customer for awhile.</review>< pics>

<review>I was amazed at the kindness of the owner and his employees at this location. My first time there, and I will be coming back! Got a great deal on an oil change with an online coupon (regular price was a plenty good deal as well!), car was ready far ahead of quoted time, kind, efficient, knowledgeable employees that did not try to tell me I needed things I didn’t. Everything they noted as observations were accurate (already known to me). I experienced great service and value here!</review><GmapID>0x80dc7ebbf5f832b7:0x35ec874ce8b0e1e6</GmapID></record>

The Fallbrook Meineke is worth driving to! I highly recommend them, and it’s just over a 30 minutes drive from the coast. The owner, Les, and Manager, Chris, are the nicest down to earth guys. They treat everyone with respect, kindness and are straight and honest about what’s going on with your car. After I was treated really rudely by the Meineke in Oceanside on Plaza Dr, I couldn’t have been happier to drive out to Fallbrook to meet and work with professional respectful honest people who don’t play-pretend in any way. The work is also quality bc they use quality parts and to quality work without gauging you. This is my new place for brakes and other auto services they offer. Plus Fallbrook offers quaint shops and eateries. I can’t recommend this particular location more! Thank you Les! :-)</Review>

I went to this business to get a part in my engine replaced. At the end of my appointment, the manager took me into the garage and told me that my car was leaking oil. I was worried, but my family convinced me to get a second opinion. Turns out that there was no oil leak. They were just trying to scare me and spend more money. I won’t be going back.< /Review>

<Text>Andy and Les worked with me to resolve an elusive issue with my 2011 Nissan Rogue that would have cost twice as much to fix at the dealership. Andy is a very knowledgeable and no nonsense guy who treated me fairly and respectfully. From oil changes to more complicated repairs they've been efficient and thorough.

<review>Andy really knows cars and trucks. He is knowledgeable courteous and reasonable fees. He will tackle small unusual requests such as welding on a broken door handle part.  I thought they only did mufflers, but they do all kinds of repairs over there. Oil changes etc. Even fixed a flat tire for me. One of his staff over there even lent me his iPhone charger for my phone while I was waiting. Five stars for them over there.</review>< username>

<Review>WARNING: if you're looking for great service, excellent customer service, and expecting honesty.
Then this is the place for you!!
This place has integrity and great people, Andy, Christopher, and their staff have made it very easy to resolve all my issues with my vehicles at great prices.
I've been to many mechanics with despicable results and frustration.
Here, you will save money, have a better service and time saved.
For those that gave bad reviews, please stop doing drugs, your not well!!

I went to the Fallbrook Meineke store with an email coupon I received directly from Meineke for $19.95. When I showed up the clerk said. "We don't have a $19.95 deal.  I showed him the email.

I know there is a waste disposal fee.   However,  I was charged a total of  $27.36.  Never did my receipt say $19.95 anywhere.   How about some integrity?

I won't be going back.< /review>

My professional opinion, i would recommend this shop over others locally, Good experience. Quality and honest service and friendly , knowledgeable staff.
On a personal note, a little too quick to want to start "wrenching" as opposed to going over and establishing a plan (with the customer/vehicle owner) beforehand.
However with the experience of the techs, and quality of service you get, you wont be disappointed.< /Review>

Great guys here. They will accommodate a walk in as best as they can and that is rare these days. They will at least make the time to hear you out and offer up a solution. They can do it all concerning your vehicle and will not rip you off. They will even discuss your situation and offer up the yay or nay concerning what some other place told you about your vehicle.
I cannot stress enough that this is the only place in Fallbrook that has serviced more than one of my vehicles and has not either messed up the service or ripped me off. Other, unnamed places in town, have done just that and that has always been a problem in Fallbrook. Lousy people always end up here and rip off the locals that try to support the town. These guys do not pull that sort of stuff. I highly recommend them for repairs and they can fit you end at the end of the day for a very quick oil change.

I have to make an update here. Previously the service was great. The previous oil change back in September or October was not. I checked my oil level and it was only half full. I added oil to he correct level and it stayed there for over 3500 miles. No leaks anywhere so the tech didn't fill it to spec.
Jan 6, 2021, I had another oil change. Down the road I started smelling oil burning. I checked the engine and the tech had not replaced the oil cap on my engine after he did the oil change. It was sitting on top of the inject manifold. I got some oil sprayed in the engine compartment. What made me mad was that the cap could have launched off and hit a vital engine part and I would be in a world of hurt.
I shouldn't have to pay over 40 bucks for an oil change only to have to inspect my truck before I leave. Now I have to crawl under my truck to see if everything is alright where the plug and filter are or see if they even changed it out.
I won't be going back to this place again. That we way too dangerous of a mistake to have happened leaving the oil cap sitting on the engine block.<//Text>

<Text>Very rude service. I had a big job done on my Corolla, so my car was in the shop a few days. When i went to pick it up Andy the manager as said by him, ripped a paper from my moms hands as she went to look at it as i was about to sign. He said that wasn't for her to look at. When i asked why cant we see what we on the paper that he asked me to sign he said some things wernt for the customer to see. Okay well at the end he ended up showing us anyways after i mentioned id like to be ensured that i wasn't over charged. Like i said big expensive job. My mom inserted her credit card and he snatched her card out of her hand when she pulled the chip out when it said remove card. He aggressively grabbed the card from her then put it back in the machine. After that i let him know that was very inappropriate and hes to never snatch a persons card or paper out of their hands as he did so aggresivly. He painfully appoligized only after we asked for the manager, he said he was the manager. Id never go back there. I felt very threatened as well for my mother, i normally do not speak up for myself and let things slide so this was beyond unprofessional.<//Text>< Pics>

Only came in because I had an oil change coupon that included a free tire rotation. I will say the service was ok and they were quicker than I expected. However, my tires weren't rotated and instead of getting it for 19.95 plus tax like my coupon said The invoice just reflected a 15$ discount & didn't say anything about tire rotation. I could have spent 10$ more and done it myself at home with a higher quality oil & filter, but I came in for the tire rotation which I didn't even get. Not super disappointed, but most likely won't be coming back.< /Text>

I had to have my truck towed here and Jack helped me. He was amazing super helpful, and straight forward! If we ever need any help again I would definitely come back and would recommend them!< /review>

<Text>I am just adding to my previous review because I made the mistake of giving this place another chance. I came to Meineke Car Care for an oil change. I had an appointment for 9:30 a.m. and came in around 9:23 a.m.. I went on a run while waiting for the oil change to be done. I come back approximately 40 minutes later to find that my car is parked right where I left it and hadn't even been touched yet. Worst part is that they helped a customer who was also getting an oil change but checked in after I did yet still was serviced first. I finally got a call at 11:15 with them saying my oil change was done. Nearly 2 hours of waiting when I already had an appointment set up.The only reason I come to Meineke is because they have really good coupons. But it's not worth waiting an hour and a half or more for an oil change when you had an appointment set up for 9:30. This Meineke will never get my business again. I strongly recommend going somewhere else to get your car serviced. These guys don't deserve any of your business. Take your hard earned money to someone who will give you quality customer service and complete service in a somewhat timely manner. They have no sense of time or customer service.

Took a little over an hour to do a simple oil change. Watched them try to over price customers twice while I waited an entire hour! I don't recommend coming here unless you have really good coupons.<//Text><rating>1</rating></record>

I never do review but made account here just to do this. This place is horrible. Worst car care I've ever been to. Would never recommend. Just as others have said, their prices are ridiculous and I even notice my vehicle seem much worse after one visit when other car care places I never have this issue. They can try say it's not them all they want as I saw them try in response to another review. But it's not mere coincidence this happen to more than one after visiting their car "care". Never go here. Do favor and pick another.< /Text>

<text>just picked up my auto form the Fallbrook location Brought it in for check engine light and issues with cruise control/odometer/speedometer feeling that most likely they were all linked...Upon picking up the auto we were charged 100.00 less that the estimated figure given a few hours earlier Reason was because mechanic found that one of the issues involved only a loose wire and they did not have to replace the expensive sensor Point is that this auto repair shop not only does a professional job but they are honest.

<time>1515803810277< /time><text>Andy "the manager" is rude, ignorant, disrespectful and does not have a clue as to what decent customer service is.  Look at the number of negative reviews here that involve this man...it is astounding that he still works there!  I called today to find out what an oil change would cost and if a coupon ($19.95 for 5qts. & filter) on their site would apply.  I tried to explain that I wanted a price for my car that takes 6 qts and has a canister filter (which I was providing), but he kept rudely interrupting me and said that I'd have to bring it in.  When I told him that I had called 3 other places and all of them told me exactly what it would cost, he laughed condescendingly and said "They can't do that without looking at the car first.  Do you expect me to keep all of the information on every car in my head?".  You have got to be kidding me!  I asked him, "Doesn't your system allow you to put in the make/model/engine and figure out the price immediately?  I have a 2006...".  Boom he cuts me off mid-sentence to rudely explain how busy he is and that he can't give me a price without seeing the car first.  This is not the first bad run-in that we've had with Andy but it will be our last.  SAVE YOURSELF A TON OF FRUSTRATION & WASTED HEARTBEATS AND STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!!!< /text><Gmap_id>0x80dc7ebbf5f832b7:0x35ec874ce8b0e1e6<//Gmap_id>< resp>

The guy at the front desk Andy, he may be the manager, really needs to learn how to talk to his customers. I have been hear several times for oil changes and have witnessed his rude tone and sarcasm before. But today it involved me so that is why I decided on the review. My wife dropped her Durango off for an oil change. And apparently she didn't tell them we had a coupon when she dropped it off. When I returned with her to pick it up, I presented the coupon but was snapped at by Andy, saying that I need to present that before the work was done. He told me that it started that on the coupon, and it does in tiny writing at the bottom. I told him that my wife dropped it off not me and I was unaware that she didn't show the coupon. His reply was "that doesn't matter" in a very rude tone. The coupon was for a basic oil change and that is what we asked for. Why does it matter when the coupon is presented? Is the services going to change? I can understand if I recieved a differnt oil change other than what was on the coupon then yes, I understand it couldn't be used. Rather than having some customer service and care for his customer, Andy just wanted to be rude and prove his point. This is a small town and I try and support local but will now not be taking either of my cars there due to Andy. To top it all off, my card was double charged because I apparently pulled my card out of the machine to early. Even though I was presented my paper work and asked to sign. Now I have to wait for one charge to drop off.</Text>

<Review>For simply installing a drain pan was going to run me $200!! For simply examining my fuel tank to determine the problem would run $180!!  Where do these people get their prices?!?! There must be a gas leak in the shop because they have got to be high if they think I'm paying that for a simple job. I would even be supplying the parts!

And i called another time to get a quote to change my rear brakes....$500.

The older gentleman that runs the front desk during the week is quite rude. In my opinion the older gentleman was argumentative,condescending to all people in store. As well as screaming at his stafc so loud could be heard outside about clocking in 2 min late, to include loud cursing. The mechanics are nice do their job.<//text>

<text>"Andy" the apparent "manager" of the Fallbrook Meineke is uneducated, rude, demeaning, inappropriate and should never be given access to dealing with potential customers.

I've contacted corporate offices and filed a full complaint with them.

No customer of any service provider should ever be subjected to be treated in the manner he treated me.

I do not recommend having your vehicle serviced there unless you just don't care about being treated like a worthless, bothersome inconvenience to his day behind the check-in desk.

As an international business owner, I have never been so disrespected and would fire ANY employee in my organization, on the spot if any one of them were a fractional offensive as this person is.

Take your business where it is appreciated and where you are respected and dealt with cordially.<//text>< pictures>

I had my first encounter with Meineke when I bought a car from one of the Smog Technicians at the store for $1200. Turns out it was one of those 'buy back' deals the government does, where they give you $500 for a clunker to junk it so you have some new cash for a new car to buy; but the guy just turned around, pulled the check engine light out, and sold it to me. Among other problems I have, I'm physically disabled, so that right at the bat is pure taking advantage of.

For years I avoided Meineke, telling them that the place was haunted with terrible people.   But today I was extremely ill, my day off, and the only place I know in Fallbrook that does oil Change is Meineke, my father had been saying "naw, they have new owners, just go check it out, that guy that stole from you isn't there anymore blah blah blah" so I was like fine, their oil changes are $50 but screw it, rather not drive to WalMart when I'm feeling so ill, almost hospital ill, just stop by Meineke. I have a bad feeling about these places, so I check under my hood, the hoses, breaks, etc. to make sure they have no stupid sales pitch to give me. Everything fine, a little bit of dirt, but hoses and clamps are all nicely places, belts fresh, and I'm expecting 'you need tires' deal.

I walked in, wanted oil change, made it clear I've never heard of 'extra special oil' and did not accept the upsale. I sat outside. Five minutes into the oil change, guy comes out, and I think hes straight up joking with me, "Your radiator is leaking."

Me: "No its no, aha."
Him: "Yes it is, its leaking."
Me: "You gotta be kidding, I just looked at it five minutes ago and it was just fine. I've done mechanic work before."
Him: "I'll show you."

Apparently, when they 'pulled off the hose' to feign the broken incident, it broke off the cuff on the radiator where the hose clamps on to the radiator. I said, no that wasn't there before, it was 100% fine five minutes ago, and they must have done something to it, and I'm not going to pay for something they broke, and I want to leave.  He pulls into a parking spot, gets out to hand me the keys. while coolant is GUSHING all over the pavement. So either by random statistical anomaly never before happened in the history of the world, my radiator happened to by itself go out in the five minutes between me driving it to the shop (because I had manually check myself) and the fifteen seconds of driving it from the garage to their parking area.

While coolant was everywhere, I said, what the heck why did you do this? He said he'd pull it back in and look at it. By now, I'm infuriated that these people purposely destroyed my property for their benefit, and an extreme detriment to myself.

I told him I want to pay for my oil change and leave.

The guy wouldn't let me pay and leave. I stood there for five minutes. I continued to tell him I want to pay for my car and leave. I want to pay for my oil change and get away from this dangerous place.

These were among the things he said at my accusations of him ripping my part out of the car.

"We are all trying to make money here."
"If you drive off, your engine will blow, do don't want that, do you?"
"What do you mean, you don't have enough money, you have enough money to get your wheels back, don't you?"

I mean, this was straight up extortion. I saw the guy deliberately damage my car, the other mechanics backed him up in bullying me, meanwhile, I need medication and my child is with me, my day off, the only day I have to do things, waiting for these horrible sociopathic people to let me go.  They didn't. I was really close to calling the cops.  I didn't know what to do.

Apparently, someone in my family called and offered to pay for the repair. I don't know what type of swindling went on, but there was definitely some total criminal bad juju going on here.

DO NOT GO HERE. IF THEY BELIEVE YOU CANNOT FINANCIALLY SUE THEM OR FIND ANOTHER MODE OF TRANSPORTATION THEY WILL EXTORT YOU.

This is a dangerous trap if you have a family.

BEWARE!!! BEWARE Go somewhere else< /Review>

Arrived at 3:38 pm on Sunday and was told they were getting ready to close and declined to change my oil and filter though their advertised hours were until 4 pm and offered to make appointment for Monday.  No way to run a business!</text>

It was Saturday afternoon on memorial day weekend when my cooling system belt and pulleys broke on my bmw.   I was two hundred miles from homework the holiday.   They ordered the parts and got me back running down the road within just hours of closing time.  Hallelujah.  The meinike team saved me from disaster.   Thank you!<//Review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>I came here on a whim after wanting to avoid the crowds at Zebulon. Honestly this bar is a hidden gem, and thank god it hasn’t been flipped upside down and turned into condos.

The outside is a neon lit heaven from the 1960s. You enter and the staff are warm from the get go. There is a left and a right side to the bar: The right side is a sizable dance floor complete with a gigantic disco ball, Dj booth, a couple leather booths, and panther sculptures. They played disco and funk this very day and the crowd was diverse and cool.

The left side is the bar where there a probably 5 or six extremely comfortable retro leather booths. They have a great tequila selection but you can also order a $4 Tecate. My kind of joint full of vibe that i can’t wait to try again!</Review>< pics>

Meh . They attempt to keep the dive bar feel after it was taken over and remodeled . I'm a LA native, atwarian at that!  The ambience is more of a hipster bar with a mic of the old regs from before .   For the price point , def not a dive bar . My husband is a reg from the day ( whiskey/coke type of man) , I on the other hand choose not to go there . I can go next door to the Tavern similar price point and get actual decent drinks !< /review>

One of the best bars in Los Angeles, let alone Atwater Village. Pouring with a heavy hand, playing tunes on a great jukebox, keeping it real in an old-school bar. We miss Betty, the owner, but we're happy the Tee-Gee's doors are still swinging.< /text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>This is my second time with Fix Auto. I had a great experience with them. Tony, Daniel and entire team are professional. Most importantly they do excellent work.They  kept me informed of their progress on the car. They are detail oriented to making sure your car looks brand new again after repair. Car was clean, front bumber repaired, and it felt like new when I picked it up. I would highly recommend Fix Auto Palo Alto for your auto body repair needs. Happy and satisfied customer.</review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

This shop is a gem. I am so grateful to have them 11 minutes away from me as for some reason I run into a lot of cars so I need a good amount of bodywork done almost every week.  I coordinate with Javier and his team to tackle any job from a small spoiler to painting an entire fender. The team is very thorough in their work so I am very happy using them. I highly recommend this body shop and will continue to use them in the future. They are certified in everything that they do and they have top notch quality.<//review>

The built in active spoiler was damaged and got separated from the car, needing replacement. I was referred to them by the service dept at Tesla.. They fixed it in 2 days. I had a great experience with them. They called me with updates as well as other details in between.A 5 star service for me.<//Text>

I pursued an insurance claim with Fix, who was the insurance agency's choice based on proximity to my home.

The repair involved a bit of paint work and some minor body panel adjustments. The repair job they quoted was comprehensive but not excessive. The results were quite satisfactory.

The experience was quite smooth and everyone I interacted with from the shop was professional, communicative, and patient about answering all of my questions, despite seeming quite busy overall.

I would be happy to take my business there again.</Text>

My 2018 Ford F350 King Ranch had the Bed damaged on the left side by the fender.
Since it's an Aluminum body, Most body shops turned me away.
Fix Auto Palo Alto is also the former Cavalino Auto Body that is Specializing in Ferrari Cars.
Now you know that Ferrari owners are probably some of the most Skeptical and Critical Car owners on the planet. So for them to have a successful and thriving business working on those cars, than my Ford is not going to be an issue and it will be fixed Top Notch.  Being aluminum body when I heard that they are also Tesla Certified (Tesla's being all aluminum) than they must have the knowledge and tools to work on my Aluminum truck.
Well I have to tell you, When I got my truck back, that the results of the repair exceeded my expectations. There is no doubt in my mind I selected the correct shop to fix my truck's damage. The paint is a perfect match to the original, and also the paint is as smooth if not smoother than the factory finish. That is no easy feat. Their painter is Top notch to have the glossy smooth finish that my repaired Truck Bed has now.
Thank you guys.
If I need any other paint or body work done. I know where to go.

Javier and his team do such a great job. They produced top quality results on my Trailblazer and took the time to listen to what I was hoping for.

They also did a fantastic job on my F-250 a few years back. It's nice to be able to count on consistent excellence.</Review>

Very well run shop. They were exceptionally well organized & knew exactly what needed to be done to repair my car. They followed up with phone notifications and finished the repairs ahead of expected schedule. Full lifetime warranty on the repairs they did. Car looks great & everything works as before. Tony Espinosa managed the job with support from Javier and other office staff. Fix Auto was recommended to me by AAA when I filed my insurance claim. Excellent work.< /text>

The guys were considerate and very helpful! Car was ready faster than predicted and is better than new! Made a bad experience (hit by another car) so much more pleasant!</Review>

<Text>I brought my car in after it was rear ended. The staff was professional, competent, efficient and a pleasure to work with.  While I certainly hope I don't need their services going forward, I'm glad to know they are there. I will definitely go back should need their services in the future.< /Text>< Rate>

<Response>None</Response><Review>I have my car in the body shop right now. I don't believe they are 100 % straight with me. They say this and that but it seems to me they are not completely truthful. They said they were going to call me and never did and it doesn't add up.  I've taken my car here twice before with no issues but it seems they are not as good as they used to be. Customer service is poor.</Review>< Rate>

Come here if you want to be questioned about your order. Ordered 2 of the same shoes online. Ended up not liking them, but since I returned them at different times (since one was delivered later) I was questioned. Apparently you're not allowed to dislike their shoes.</Text>

Love the shoes, but takes long time for people to give you the shoe size. People go to the back and get the shoe size you want. Sometimes I feel bad that people are getting the shoe size I want especially because a lot of people come into the store.</review>

<Text>Top notch Van's store! Troy is an asset to the company and was very helpful. From the top 5% Google guide in the IE take it from me go see Troy at Tyler mall Van's store! One of the few SoCal skate/beach wear stores that have toddler shirts and shoes. Tillys and Zumies leave the little cats out but not Van's.< /Text>< pics>

<text>DO NOT SHOP AT THAT STORE!!!!
absolutely piss poor pathetic customer service. i am utterly amazed at how bad it was. before i went there i called to see if a certain product was in stock. i went there, saw it, had the money to purchase it, but couldn't get it. why? because the employees have piss poor customer service skills. in fact, i would say that they had NO customer service skills.

Super amazing service! Rico and Hector are so helpful omg! They help disassemble all my furniture and carefully wrap them with extra waterproof layers. MakeSpace also mailed me bags ahead to help me pack. I also just love their mobile app, so sleek! and all the stored items are tracked. I used to think moving/storing furniture is such a headache, but this is so simple!! Love it< /review>

<Rate>1</Rate><UserId.>112482747584640249665</UserId.><text>Junk storage service. They damaged my $3500 leather couch by not wrapping it properly. I told the pickup team to wrap it properly to avoid damaging it. But the pickup person told me not to worry and that they will make sure not to damage the couch. When they delivered my couch it was exactly in the same state - not wrapped properly with one end of it exposed and damaged due to shoddy wrapping and damaged during transit and storage.

When I opened a claim for my damages, they offered 60 cents per pound.

Store only things that are worth 60 cents per pound at this junk storage place.

They also lost my bed frame. And had no record of it.

SHAME ON MAKESPACE. SHAME ON RAHUL

Every review on Google is fake! Look at yelp for a more accurate picture of the quality of this junk service.

They stole & broke many items.. do not use this service!

The moving out day was efficient but everything after that was beyond horrible. I have changed my review to reflect this.

<text>Yovanny, Cristian, and Andy were great. They kept me up to date on their ETA, took good care of my stuff as they packed it, and took apart my furniture at my request so it would take up less space. I had my own mattress cover so they didn’t charge me for that service but they still helped me the cover on (which I wasn’t able to do alone). I had around a studio apartment sized amount of stuff and they were in an out in less than an hour and a half. Really nice guys, thanks again!< /text>< pictures>

Andy and Demarco are the best movers I have ever had. They were super polite and efficient, helpful in answering any questions we had about packing items, and very informative about the process and next steps. They showed up exactly on time and provided any additional materials we needed to secure items and close up boxes. Highly recommended!!< /Review>

<review>I had such an amazing experience with MakeSpace. The movers in particular made it such a pleasant experience. I had Abdullah, Fernando and Cristian spearheading the effort. What an amazing team. They were friendly, swift, and very respectful of my belongings. They took extra care with delicate items like artwork and mirrors etc. and I felt complete trust in them. I would recommend this team to anyone moving in SF – I wouldn't want anyone else on the job!<//review>< pics>

Juan and Jesus sent me a message in advance informing that they would be here in 30 minutes, they called me when they arrive and they were so fast and respectful! My suitcases and boxes were taken with care and respect.
Would I hire them again? Of course! Amazing and the best service!

Eric and Cesar did awesome work and I can’t expect more. What I need to do was left the key to them and came back when moving was done. They wrap every piece carefully and handle it very professional. Definitely will choose them next time moving.< /Review>

Holy costumer care and support! Moving is stressful and MakeSpace makes the process super easy. No moving fees, 48 hours to cancel (in case your moving date changes), great customer support and super nice movers who don’t waste time.
I had to move my move date a few times and it was so easy to do with the app and reminders that were sent. The customer service team always check back with me while I was figuring out the logistics of my move. Christian, Roberto, and Rico were the most kind and professional movers. I had even locked myself out (did I mention moving was stressful?) and they were patient and helpful with me getting into my apartment. After my items were moved my storage quote had changed and I contacted CS again and they made an adjustment for me.
The process is so seamless and easy with Make Space. Would recommend to anyone who is looking for storage or to move.< /text>

<text>This is my 2nd pick-up from MakeSpace.  Abdullah and Eric were great.  Friendly and very professional.   I can't recommend them enough!

My first pick-up with MakeSpace was a different experience.   A large mirror (before and after photos attached) was left outside by the MakeSpace Team for an extended period of time and the San Francisco wind knocked it over.   Broke into lots of little pieces that required quite a bit of time for me to clean up.

The support team at MakeSpace seems very nice but everything is done via email (there is no way to upload photos to your account or submit a support ticket for broken items thru your account).  Would be very helpful if all of this could be done in the MakeSpace portal instead of lots of emails going back forth.< /text>< Resp>

Josh and Timothy were incredible! Truly can not say enough about their service. There were communicative before arriving letting us know their ETA. They got started right away and had a great system working together. They inventoried and packed our things soundly and securely. They worked through the day and helped to ensure everything was perfect. Thank y’all so much!!!< /review>

MakeSpace is an excellent service that provides diligent and efficient work. Fernando and Maynor were huge in making my move today as quick and painless as possible! They were really nice and took great care of my stuff. I can’t think of much to complain about... as difficult as moves can be most of the time, it is a pretty convenient and reliable service!! Will update when I receive my stuff back at a new place in a few months.< /Review>

Fernando & Roberto were so nice & helpful! They gave  us a call when they were arriving and helped us organize some remaining items very efficiently. We were able to move our whole apartment in about 30 minutes and they also took care of packing everything properly. They saved us so much time & energy on our move day and were super nice - definitely recommend. :)</Review>

Jesus and Daniel did an AMAZING job. They texted before arriving, were kind and courteous over the phone, and handled each of my items with the type of care that I would. Anyone who gets this dynamic duo is lucky, and they will do an awesome job helping with your storage solution. I felt extremely confident in the way they packed/protect my items, and they had plenty of room for all my stuff. They were quick, efficient, and really pleasant to work with. I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for storage!< /Text>

<Text>Best moving experience by far! I would like to thank Eric Chan & Fernando for being super careful and professional during the whole moving process. They handle our fragile items with extra cautious. I was worry about the lack of space given the amount of items I have. And Eric gave me useful advice and practical solutions. Also Fernando took the extra step to dissemble some of my furnitures without me asking to. PRO work! Many thanks! !
I would definitely use MakeSpace as my default moving option in the future and recommend it to friends.</Text>< Pictures>

This was a smooth experience, all three of the employees from MakeSpace made sure I did not touch a thing while they were there. I normally want to help to make it go faster, but they were fast and efficient. As well as friendly and kind and gentle with all of my things. Rico, Andy, and Demarco were great!<//Review>

Hector was the absolute best! After a nightmare of a move Hector was the man who made it all possible — and went above and beyond to ensure everything was loaded and secure. Honestly couldn’t have done it without him.</text>

<Review>Great service for a great price. Reusable packing totes are sent to you ahead of time, making for a clever, easy packing process. The crew of 3 that picked up my items for storage were professional and friendly. Would definitely recommend!<//Review>< gmapID>

<Text>Eric, Rico and Abdul were excellent. They arrived right on time and got to work immediately. We had a ton of stuff and they were proactive about calling in additional help right away to assist with some of the larger items. We also were getting ready for a long-haul move directly out of storage and they were very helpful in ensuring our fragile and valuable items were wrapped up and secured extra well. Would definitely use them again.< /Text>< userid>

Today I tried out this new company because I wanted to store some furniture. I just expected that they would load it into the truck and store it but Fernando and Demarco came, wrapped up everything with moving blankets and plastic wrap and then took photos so I could see it later. Literally as soon as they let, the items showed up on my website account. They had to move furniture that was up two flights of stairs and did it really well. I highly recommend this service. I'm glad that someone is finally disrupting the expensive traditional model of storage :)< /text>

Amazing, seamless moving experience with fantastic customer service. Juan C. and Lewis were kind and efficient when moving our belongings into our new space. I used Makespace to move out, to store for 6+ months, and to move in, and the people + website has been a 10/10 experience. Even though an item was accidentally damaged during the process, the Makespace customer support team has had our back and helped us resolve the claim with no headache at all. Honestly, this is the only company I'm going to turn to in the future and the only one I'd recommend so strongly.<//text>

Josh Chris and Juan arrived on time and were really nice and professional. I wish the process was faster, we were ready with everything packed and ready to go and it still took almost 5 hours to pack our 1 bedroom. They did get additional folks to help expediting the process. Thank you and stay healthy<//Review>

Beware. Movers will come, give terrible attitude about having to pick up items, if an item is too heavy they'll just leave it behind, and when you want to have your items moved back in, there's all this fine print around how you can move it, cost of moving it, and so forth. For instance, if you want to pick your items up yourself with a uhaul, they won't help you load the items onto your truck. There are cheaper, easier options out there for both moving and storage.< /Text>

<text>Eric and Rico were amazing. They were fast, efficient, clean. They also practiced social distancing and took care of everything in less than 75 minutes which was impressive. We had 120 minutes allotted to this. Will definitely use the service again and highly recommend it.< /text>< pics>

Super quick, professional and friendly service by Jonathan and Darreus! They arrived earlier than expected (after notifying me first, of course) and made the experience totally hassle-free. Will definitely be happy to work with MakeSpace again and recommend them to anyone who needs storage. Thanks again!</review>

Everything was well organized, and they helped protect all of my furniture with extra boxes and materials they had brought without ask.

Very quick, hassle-free moving and storage, seriously, try it! Special shout-out to Yovanny Louis and Christopher for making this very easy and seamless. They were very careful about COVID related guidelines, did most of the inventory work outdoors and explained the whole process very clearly. I still cannot completely believe how easy and fast moving my 1 BR apartment worth of stuff was. Thank you people and happy holidays.<//Review>

Ryan, Angel and Rob were awesome. They carefully and efficiently moved us out of our 2 bedroom with huge attention to detail. We really enjoyed our move out experience and would definitely recommend these guys! I would note to make sure you’re aware of the number of items including boxes you’re moving to make sure you’re not surprised with the unit size you need at the end.<//Review>

<time>1619828045616<//time><text>Overall this service was great it’s so convenient having movers and storage all in one service.

Making the request was super simple as well. My only complaint is that my bags for packing up my stuff never arrived. I had to go buy my boxes last minute so I could pack ahead of time.

Bhavjeet and Daniel were my movers and helped pack up all my stuff. They were awesome. I would have only given 4 stars because of the issue with my bags but these guys did such a good job I decided to bump it up. They were quick and professional. They went the extra mile to make sure my stuff was safe and secure while packing.

<review>Really Bad. Nice delivery personnel but super super slow customer feedback.

I got a delivery two weeks ago with 3 items missing. They just can't find the items in their warehouse for over 2 weeks.

Even though they said I can file claims about the missing items, it took them FOREVER to reply back or even reimburse me for my loss.

If you have valuable furniture, definitely NOT choose this service.< /review>< gmapID>

Best moving experience ever. Signing up and communication from makespace leading up to the moving day was clear and helpful. Having bags ahead of time to pack was convenient and made the moving day easier. The stickers and labels for the moving bags made organization easy! Having an arrival window is normal for the industry, but makespace even sent me a text with an ETA they day of when they left their previous job, with a 30-40minute ETA depending on traffic. Once the team was here, Eric, Jesus and Ricardo did an absolutely fantastic job moving everything out speedily without sacrificing quality. They did a better job packing and safeguarding our furniture than we could have imagined! Very kind, answered our questions, and handled everything. All this and it was the cheapest option too!  This made moving such a breeze, I look forward to using makespace again.< /Text>

I'm so happy I picked MakeSpace among the other moving and storage solutions. Shoutout to Fernando and Joseph N. who made our move seamless (we were moving out of a 3-story walkup apartment). They kept me updated with their arrival times, and I didn't have to lift a finger because they took care of everything.

A few weeks ago when I was making a reservation, I was in between two storage unit sizes and decided to rent the larger of the two options to be safe. Customer Service assured me that if my belongings fit into a small unit, they would bill me for the smaller space, and sure enough my invoice was cheaper than I anticipated!< /Text>

Fernando, Demarco, and Timothy were honestly the safest, most personable, and efficient movers. I am so glad to have used MakeSpace because of them. They were super communicative about arrival time, expectations, and simplified the process for me so much - I even got a great soul food rec too. MakeSpace, you’re doing well to have these guys be ambassadors for your company. Thank you again Fernando, Demarco, and Timothy. Happy holidays!< /text>

Bhavjeet and Louis were on-time and super helpful in helping move our items into MakeSpace possession yesterday! Really appreciated their help in getting our items squared away and that they took the time to protect and shrink-wrap delicate surfaces (e.g., our wood kitchen table). Thanks again!<//review>

Such a great company!! I’m moving home for a few months and I’m so glad I found MakeSpace for storage/movers. Eric and Rico were great and I didn’t have to do anything day of the move. Definitely recommend<//text>

I couldn’t recommend Makespace more. The movers - Joseph, Cesar, and Jesus - were fantastic. My packers hadn’t done the best job and they went out of their way to ensure my things were as safe as possible going into storage. East communication before the movers and very east interface. Five stars!</Review>

DeMarco Daniel and Josh were very helpful with my move. I was very stressed about moving out of my place under a time constraint and they not only made me comfortable and confident that my stuff was cared for properly but also made the moving experience lovely and full of laughter.
Seamless!

Thanks you guys, I appreciate it so much!!!<//text>

Yovanny and Jose helped me move my stuff into storage very quickly and professionally, while following all COVID-19 safety measures. Bags were provided by MakeSpace ahead of time for packing up all smaller objects, and all furniture like mattresses and TVs were properly wrapped and boxed up by the movers. Thanks a lot for making storage so easy!</Text>

<text>Was provided great service from the MakeSpace teams, from pickup to delivery everyone was so respectful and friendly to speak with. I stored my items for about half a year and was so glad to see them mostly unharmed (my bad for putting easily bendable items that can’t fit in a box in storage!)

Special thanks to Bhavjeet & Fernando for getting my stuff up a windy, small mountain and having to deal with oncoming traffic.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

I had Joseph,Cesar, and Jonathan who Helped me out on Thursday to move the entire stuffs from my room and they were just amazing. They texted me 30-40 mins before arrival, and professionally moved everything out within an hour. I was a bit stressed with the whole idea about moving, but they just made it so simple and easy. I had 17 bins, 2 wardrobe boxes, a queen size mattress, and a bed frame, etc. and they carried positive attitude throughout the whole time and well explained all of my questions. I really appreciate their service and I hope they will be assigned again when I move my stuffs out of storage and deliver to the new address. Thanks a lot guys!!<//Review>

Had a great experience with Bhavjeet and Juan in Cupertino! The company overall is great and easy to store stuff, and the movers are always very friendly. Very cheap storage services too!</review>

Moving is stressful enough so having people who show up and are not only efficient, but super friendly is always a plus. I had several items that were really heavy and difficult to handle + a weird staircase to maneuver and they handled all of it without a problem. I’ll definitely be recommending MakeSpace to family and friends.< /Review>< Pics>

We just finished the pickup of our entire 1BR apartment while we skip out for a few months during quarantine and as far as pickup goes, this was truly an incredible experience. Ricardo, Jesus and Eric were professional, personable, and careful with our stuff. If they also did regular moving services, we’d use them in a heartbeat.  I was concerned that this would be more like storage pickup and less like moving, but it was not - they had furniture pads, boxes, wrap, and that gave us a great deal of confidence that our items would remain secure.</Text>

I put my stuff into storage with MakeSpace. They sent a team of 3 people who worked relentlessly to move my 2 bedroom’s worth of furniture! The process was easy and I would definitely use them again.

Shout out to Cristian, Timothy, and Joseph N for all the help! They were prompt, dealt with my building’s regulations, and went the extra mile to store some odd shaped items!</review>

We just had our storage pick up with Jonathan and Cesar and the whole process went really smoothly. They were on time, tagged everything, and got everything in the truck safely. Really happy with the decision to invest in long-term offsite storage with this company.</text>

I WAS stressed before I downloaded Makespace. I'm moving from SF to Mexico indefinitely and needed a way to 1. transport my stuff 2. keep my stuff safe and 3. allow me to extend on an ongoing basis. I don't know when I'm coming back to the U.S. (hopefully never) but I do know that booking this was as easy as it should be. Now I'm not stressed about moving. My representative was super nice and had great chat.<//Text>

Joshua and Dominic emptied my storage unit today. They were prompt, professional, and polite! I live in a high rise apartment building and they respectfully coordinated moving a large sectional sofa into the building so as not to disturb property tours and residence. They went above and beyond by texting me when delivery was complete and the property manager of my building remarked on how efficient they were. I highly recommend these gentlemen.<//Review>

I am super pleased with how professional and efficient Daniel and Juan were with my MakeSpace appointment. They took excellent care of my belongings and were swift with the move. This has been the best moving experience so far! Thank you, MakeSpace!< /Review>

< Review>
I tried to move out by myself - and ended up falling down the stairs and breaking my foot! If only I knew how AMAZING MakeSpace was, I definitely would not be wearing a boot right now.

Since I was unable to do basically anything, the MakeSpace team came to the rescue. They arrived right on time, quickly packed everything up, and even went above and beyond by helping me pack since I physically wasn't able to.

I was super lucky to get the dream team - Rico, Armando, and Eric. All three were super helpful, empathetic, and did a fantastic job communicating my different options with me. They took a super stressful situation and made it, dare I say, fun? Thanks again, MakeSpace!< /Review>

DO NOT USE! STOLEN ITEMS!!! I have moved every year for the past 12 years. I have used MakeSpace in the past. Will never use them again.

They did a fine job picking up my items. However, when I requested they drop off ALL my items (approximately 25). I was informed by the movers, who were 2 hours late to the appointment, (I had an 8-11 slot, they showed up at 1) they only had 10 of the 25 items I requested. One of my items came open, I did not give it to them in that state. Items were broken in my boxes and one of the movers came in without a mask.

I was also told by the movers this happened to 3 of their other customers that day...

Knowing I still needed ALL my items back I booked another appointment and called several times to try and have my items delivered earlier. It's the day of my appointment and I get a call notifying me they cannot deliver my items again.

I am under the impression they've stolen my items at this time. Ita very difficult to deliver items you don't have.

Please please please use any other service besides this one. They are a waste of money and time.

I have been unable to be in my apartment because they have my mattress for the past we< /text>

Abdullah and Christian did a great job delivering my storage items by communicating & arriving within their promised time windows and going above & beyond in putting everything where I needed to get my home settled. I've been so impressed with MakeStorage's operations. It was so easy to have my items picked up, itemized, and delivered. The price was totally reasonable, and the digital interface made accessing my items feel tangible. A huge 5-star review from me.<//text>

<text>First time using MakeSpace and was really pleased with Josh and Bhavjeet's professionalism and efficiency with moving my items.

<text>Makespace is very helpful, organized, and efficient from the first inquiry, to booking, to moving, to storage.
Natasha was incredibly helpful setting up.

I have told so many of my friends about this company they are most likely tired of hearing about it lol I can't speak highly enough of them.

They work so quick and were super, super nice about everything.  I love the fact that they photograph everything they store for you. I wish I would of known how they photographed things because I would of organized my stuff better and wrote on the boxes what everything is. Thats my one word of advice so you can really take advantage of this part of the service.

Josh and Fernando delivered a few things for me and it was so so smooth. You select from the photos what you would like returned and they verify it a few times.

you cant beat the price of their service and everything thats included in it.< /text>

< Review>
Edited to add:
upon unwrapping my items I actually had a lot of issues.
three of the corners of my white dresser had damage, and the bag of screws to my bed frame/headboard, sides (WHICH THEY PUT IN A SEPARATE BAG AND PUT WITH MY STUFF), did not make it with my stuff. There were pictures of this in my inventory taken by makespace, and upon getting my inventory back to me, those photos were no longer apart of my inventory.....
------------
I just had my items delivered after about 6 months of storage, and thankfully, everything was in one piece! I didn’t have the best experience with customer service and management, but I can say that the amazing delivery service by Cristian and Juan totally left me with a good impression, and came as close to redeeming makespace as it could probably get. These men really brought excellent service! Thank you!< /Review>

Juan, Demarco, and Fernando were the consummate professionals. They were extremely communicative, thoughtful, patient, and thorough and paid extreme attention to detail. They spent extra time ensuring that all my valuables and furniture were properly secured, wrapped, and stored. They were also extremely knowledgeable in answering questions that I had throughout the process and made moving - which can be extremely stressful - a superb experience. I would highly recommend these movers and Makespace.

Thank you for helping me “make space” as I begin a new life chapter.

Cheers!

<Review>MakeSpace is the best!!! I moved my room out of my apartment over the summer because I went to stay with my family out of town for a while. MakeSpace came and picked up my stuff and packaged it - they were in an out in 30 min and covid safe! The pricing is really reasonable and I even had some of my furniture dropped off at my apartment a few months later and they automatically resized my storage unit which saved me about $30/month. I had the rest of my items dropped off yesterday so I could move it down to my parents house and it was super fast and convenient. Demarco and Bobby got to my apartment at 3 and loaded all my stuff into the van I rented in about 5 minutes. Great customer service and they were able to fit all my stuff somehow! I will definitely be using MakeSpace again & would recommend it to anyone.<//Review>< Pics>

Josh and Louis were fast and also helped box some small stuff I hadn’t taken care of. Recommend these guys

Yovanny and Christian were great during the delivery, fast and no hassles< /review>

Abdullah and Fernando and Christian did an amazing job at picking up and the whole experience was very smooth, really amazing team, they lacked everything nicely and were very nice. Would recommend them to anyone looking to use MakeSpace in SF.<//Review>

The experience with MakeSpace has been very easy and convenient. I was able to set up an appointment 2 weeks in advance, talk with a customer service rep to find the right size unit, and the move out was fast but careful. Special thanks to Joseph N and Fernando for the great move out experience!<//Text>

Jesus and Juan showed up right on time wearing masks and adhering to strict social distancing guidelines. They came equipped with furniture pads, wrap, and boxes. They were quick and efficient yet extremely careful and respectful with valuable items. With all the options out there, definitely consider Makespace for their top notch logistics, technology, and people!</Text>

I would give half a star if I could.  At first I thought this company would be the solution to my moving conundrum.
Instead they have DEVASTATED most of my belongings and damaged most of the rest.  And best of luck getting anyone to represent you on their end - you get to tell your sad story to every support person they employ - no ONE representative to help you and tell you VITAL, timely information.  And best of luck with the web site.  A great idea, MakeSpace, but take a pass if you expect service, professionalism or accountability.</Text>

I will be traveling for a few months before moving into a new apartment so I decided to store all of my belongings (couches, table, chair, TV’s, kitchen stuff, bedroom set) with MakeSpace. I received excellent service, both in setting up and executing the move. Bhavjeet and Eric were promptly on time, very efficient, careful with my storage items, and able to quickly adapt when they found out I had an additional couch and bed to store. I highly recommend using MakeSpace!< /review>

Great experience with Makespace! Worked with Rico, Angel and Joseph who were consummate professionals. They took their time carefully wrapping and packing my one-bedroom apartment. They treated my furniture, large flat screen TVs and belongings like their own. Communication before, during and after the move was A+. Highly recommend Makespace and Rico, Angel and Joseph!<//review>

Eric, Ryan and Demarco were very friendly, on time and efficient with the moving process! We had some loose items that we didn’t know how to store and they handled it all for us. Will recommend to anyone who is moving and needs to store items for a long period of time!<//Text>

<Review>MakeSpace and particularly Josh & Hector went above and beyond expectations to help me execute a difficult interstate move.

My moving company canceled on my pickup 3 separate times before arriving >2 hours late on the 4th attempt. Josh stood by, and ensured the pickup went smoothly despite the confusing scheduling. He even texted me the paperwork the movers required but couldn’t figure out how to send me.

It’s hard to communicate how grateful I am. They were the bright spot in an otherwise abysmal move process. Thank you MakeSpace, Hector, and especially Josh.< /Review>< Resp>

I’ve moved so many times before and this was for sure the least stressful one. Efficient, fast and safe. Joseph, Cristian, Darreus were extremely efficient and professional, and also polite, helpful and friendly. Also worth noting, since the year is 2020- they were great at keeping their masks on at all times and socially distancing themselves.

Makespace experience was seamless from getting my bags via mail, communicating up until pickup date and they also followed up right away with invoice updates afterwards.

I cannot speak for the experience retrieving my items yet but will follow up once I do.

10/10 recommend their services.< /Text>

<review>Josh, Chris, and Tim were great! Came exactly on time, were super quick, wore masks and were Covid safe. The whole process was very straightforward. I originally had booked Clutter but clutter curbside pickup sounded like you needed to move everything to the entrance. MakeSpace definitely doesn't!

Josh, Chris, and Tim came up 2 flights of stairs, had tools to help disassemble bed frame, wrapped furniture in blankets, and were patient in explaining how they protect your stuff and how they take pictures once it's in storage.

Their customer service on the phone was wish super helpful and patient when booking an appointment. Highly recommend! All in one moving service. And it's cheaper too!</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Fantastic service by Dominic and Jonathan! Quick and efficient duo for a full one bedroom move. Thank you for your service!

Service delivery #2 by Abdullah and Fernando and Juan Deleon was polite and efficient!  Thanks! Overall delivery time was delayed, but likely due to corporate scheduling.<//review>

<review>Wow, where do I begin? Today on Thursday, June 25, 2020, I was supposed to welcome three Make Space movers into our home for a move. Several minutes beforehand, the Make Space team contacted us to say the move had been canceled because they were unable to find a truck. I paid hundreds of dollars to reserve a street permit spot in San Francisco for the truck. We need to be out of our apartment by the end of the month and now the other options for moving and storage are fully booked. I would not at recommend make space as a reliable solution for your move. We have used PODS before and we are kicking ourselves for not doing so this time around. We were so excited to try out a new up-and-coming company, but our first experience out of the gate has been disastrous. We are trying to contact the leaders and other others without success. I've received no response from the text feature. And make space has screwed up on several other requests, including a long delay in sending our green bin liners.</review><pics>None</pics>< response>

Really nice and convenient service! Easy to book the time, easy to control your belongings, good and friendly representatives.
Eric, Angel and Rico were very professional and easy to deal  with. They came on time, quickly took all my stuff and packed everything with care.

MakeSpace has been a great experience. I find that it is as advertised and am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 due to the fact that a couple of my items came back damaged and one of my bags went missing. All things considered however, it's been a pretty seamless process and the pick-up and drop-off teams (Juan C. & Jose) have handled my items with care and followed strict C19 safety guidelines. MakeSpace is an easy service to use and I would definitely use them again in the future!</review>

Bhavjeet, Roberto, and Juan were fantastic. They gave me ample heads up that they were on the way, and were very fast once they arrived. They wrapped all of my furniture and gave me heads up about items that were fragile. We had a puppy, and they were so relaxed even though our dog was acting a little crazy! They made my move 10x easier, definitely will recommend this company  to friends and family.</text>

<Text>We had a wonderful experience with MakeSpace in Oakland. Abdullah and Angel and David were communicative, letting us know when they would arrive and where they parked. They were professional and efficient, moving 14 items out of our apartment in one trip! They were also very careful and respectful of our belongings. Plus, they’re patient, friendly, and genuine people. Thanks again, guys!</Text><Rating>5<//Rating><UserId.>102943356060220998609< /UserId.>< Date>

< Review>
Having to update this review to 2 stars. Been trying to reach customer service to schedule a 2nd appt to pick up last two remaining items. One is a fairly new AC unit, definitely wanted it stored. CANNOT REACH ANYBODY BUT MUSIC, and now I am being forced to junk the item. Movers great, customer service sucks. Two stars it is.

First time to use a storage company. Rates pretty reasonable, and for the actual move, these guys were great. Quick, careful with the items, and helpful when I had questions. I had a glass table which couldn't be moved as is, since glass was stuck to the base. They recommended they're disassembling it, forthright with me about signing a waver. The table was super old anyway, so ultimately decided to junk the item. I was just glad they recommended options that were feasible. I also need to schedule another appointment to pick up two more items, one was a portable AC unit that I couldn't part with just yet in this hot weather. The mover was helpful in suggesting that I first drain the unit to avoid leaking etc, and he even showed me how. Super great team, I'd highly recommend them!

Oh, can't forget to name the movers, who did such a wonderful job. Cristian, Andy, Joseph, and extra movers Juan C. and Angel 👍🏻</Review>

<Review>AVOID AVOID AVOID. I never write reviews, but felt obligated to post. DO NOT TRUST THIS COMPANY WITH YOUR ITEMS. This company will LOSE YOUR ITEMS once they take them.

I used makespace for storage in San Francisco. When I went to the warehouse to pick up my items, 4 out of 10 items were missing. This included my mattress and side tables. I followed up with customer service immediately, but over 10 days, and the items have not been located.

I scheduled ANOTHER delivery appointment about 2 weeks later, and 5 of my items are still missing. This includes the same furniture pieces as before - mattress, side tables and valuable artwork. I am still sleeping on an air mattress 2 weeks later.

Despite calling customer support at least 5 times over the last 12 days, nothing has been remediated. I am considering filing a legal claim given the seemingly reckless operations of this company.

AVOID AT ALL COSTS.< /Review>< Rating>

The movers (Jesus,Darrues, Eric) were great and carefully in moved all my items, even wrapping the dresser! They were timely, nice, and had good communication prior to arrival.

The only annoyance came from some of the Makespace policies trying to upsell mattress covers and mirror boxes to their "studier ones" for $15 each.<//text>

<review>1. Initial movers dented and damaged equipment as well as the walls of the apartment. They also threatened my uncle (assuming he was hired help and not family)

2. They confirmed they could deliver to my address before moving forward with the service. After the fact was “out of the delivery area”

3. The folks working on the help desk via phone are great, email, not so much.

4. Jonathon was the only good part of the experience. Went the extra mile. Very impressed. Followed best practices, very helpful, efficient and was very friendly. Photo attached. Kudos to you, Jonathon. Bad on you Makespace.

5. I recommend using Clutter. Exceptionally better experience. I also recommend Jonathon to go work for Clutter as well.

6. Buy bitcoin. (Not investment advice)<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

The experience with Makespace has been absolutely amazing. We had to store a whole two bedroom apartment and had a team of three professional movers come to pick up everything for free. Hector, Juan and Eric were incredibly helpful, friendly and diligent. They disassembled all the furniture and carefully packed it. They helped us with tips and gave us a lot of information on how Makespace works. All we had to do was packing the small stuff in advance in the bags they sent us and the rest was taken care of. I highly recommend this service if you want to store your stuff and need movers for it. The value is difficult to beat in any self-service alternative.<//review>

My movers Ryan and Fernando came on time, were very friendly and helpful. Wish I heard about makespace before the last time I crammed everything into a u haul and tetrised it into a storage unit. Everything went fast and smoothly, the only thing of note was they let me know they had a special box for the TV and it would be $15 more to wrap it up, which they handled quick. No fuss, would definitely recommend.< /Review>

<text>Will be recommending makespace to everyone! Joshua M, Valenta D, and Fernando C (in San Francisco) were awesome. Made quick work of a bunch of large items and carried them down many flights of stairs in my no-elevator building! I really feel like my things will be in good hands in storage, and I look forward to working with MakeSpace again in the future!</text>< pics>

Great service! Both my move in and move out crew were phenomenal and timely, making me feel super comfortable with the process. Hector and Fernando in our move out crew took the steps to make sure all items were delivered safely. I would definitely recommend this over a standard storage service for anyone in the area!</text>

Hello everyone! 👋🏻 I just finished moving out of my apt and had an awesome experience with MakeSpace. If you’re moving out of the city and looking for a storage company, I highly recommend them.

I did a lot of competitive research (Clutter, local moving companies, etc) and after talking to friends and companies on the phone, I went with MakeSpace! They made it so convenient to coordinate. They take care of pickup, transport, storage, and returns! All you do it pack up your stuff in green bags they send you in advance. Sooo easy. There were a lot of negative reviews on Yelp which made me a bit nervous, but it ended up being a fantastic experience.

Use my name Cherie Luo for $100 off your storage (you can give them my name over the phone). The MakeSpace pickup team (Armando, Rico, Juan) were professional, efficient, and COVID safe! Highly recommend!!!<//Review>

MakeSpace was cheaper as compared to other short term storage solutions. I had a great experience with team that delivered my items (Dominic, Jonathan, and Eric). I had around 50 things, including some large furniture. They worked fast and were professional. Offered to help in any way they could.

However, I will never be using MakeSpace again. There were a few minor problems with my stuff (missing and damaged items). I have tried to get in touch with someone on customer support but have not been able to reach an actual person.

I originally had told a few friends about this service but will now only consider using the competitor going forward just for the lack of customer service and respect for my items.< /review>

< review>
Pretty disappointed with my experience - my assigned time slot was 12-3pm. My makespacers arrived close to 4 pm and I was not informed that there would be a delay. I called all phone numbers listed on the website around 10-15 times after 2 pm and no one picked up or called me back. I sent several emails as well, only one of which was responded to telling me that they would give me an ETA, which I never got.
Abdullah and Daniel were great, however it was clear that they were in a hurry to load my items due to the delay. Additionally, my stuff was just sitting out on the street with no one keeping an eye on them, so I had to stay by the truck while they brought down my other boxes. I won’t be surprised if some of my items are returned to me damaged.
I still have not received a response to my email and no one has called me back as yet despite my numerous calls and emails.</review>

Thanks much to Abdullah and Andy and Darreus!

We had a really good experience with Makespace’s moving staff! Super helpful and careful. Thanks a ton to Jesus, Joseph N & Cesar!<//Review>

Christopher and Abdullah were kind and efficient and I still give them 5 stars.
Unfortunately my bed (that I love!) got broken as they dismantled it and three months later the issue is still unresolved. I know it’s COVID, but doing the right thing when one of your employees makes an honest mistake, shouldn’t take months to muster.<//review>

Makespace pick up review - Moving / storing / packing is stressful but had the most seamless experience, thanks to the makespace team and our movers Josh, Demarco and Ryan. Setting up your appointment and inventory was so easy on their website. They send you those makespace bags depending on how many you think you'll fill which makes the whole storing process so easy. The day of pick up Josh, Demarco and Ryan were so efficient, quick, careful, and safe it took all my worries away! Highly recommend, but still pending the "delivery of stored items" review< /review>

<review>Very Professional Pick-up service by Jesus, Angel, & Roberto. Secured my items with additional tape and handled wirh care.

One thing to note is that the Makespace -provided wardrobe boxes don’t have a clothing rod (so I guess they are just boxes!!?). Luckily I had a FedEx across the street and the movers were patient as I went to go buy an actual wardrobe box for the move.</review>< pictures>

<Text>I recently moved to the West Coast and I have moved twice prepping for the close of my condo. Through out the process the teams assigned to manage my move where pretty solid guys, very knowledgeable about who to handle fragile and large items. << Move #1 in Nov. 2020 Jesus, Joseph, Caesar can to move us and took their time to ensure our home goods were properly handled. There was some miscommunication on Make Space customer service side, so when the guys arrived they were not expecting as many items, but they didn’t blink an eye they called their manager and got the ok! Which was a life saver as we were moving into a hotel while our home was being finished so they were our only option. << Move #2 Jan. 2021 Hector Juan and Fernando Did a great job unloading our home goods with care, they were very pleasant and communicated ahead of their arrival and let us know how long it would take to go pick up the second half of our stuff. I would use this company again, however there was damage to key items during this moving process, I plan to file claims and will update my review accordingly.<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

<Review>Such a disappointing experience.  They wouldn't deliver to Santa Clara.  They came back with a quote around 400 dollars to do so.  Mind you I only had a bedroom stored.  Beware, they don't actually service the bay and if you pick up from their warehouse no assistance is provided.<//Review>< user_id>

<review>I would use PODS if I ever need storage and moving again. Terrible customer service AFTER they have your stuff. They make it very difficult to get your stuff out with an out-of-state moving company. They damaged many of my items and did nothing about it. They packed my items terribly and broke almost everything that was made out of ceramic or glass. Even ceramic and glass items that I packed very well, smashed due to pressure or negligence.They were very cheap with tape and allowed bottoms to fall out. They mislabled boxes which lead to most of my things being broken.
Excellent pick up and packing experience.Juan, Daniel, and Juan were very courteous, professional and quick but unfortunately did not care to pack my items with care despite tips. Once they have your stuff they treat you like trash over the phone. Never again.< /review><Gmap_id>0x808f796d4e3b209d:0x610ddc9035cb9018</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I couldn’t be there in-person for pickup, but Abdul and Dominic did a great job communicating with my roommate and keeping me updated via texts/phone calls. Def recommend if you’re looking for a full service storage solution.</Text>

I had a great experience with MakeSpace! Dominic and Abdul were great - they were quick, friendly, and professional. Overall, the whole experience made moving out a lot less stressful. Highly recommend!

Update to review: I just experienced the delivery process as well to remove my items from storage and it's just as amazing! Seamless, easy, and overall great! Josh was quick and efficient in his delivery and excited to use MakeSpace in the future for any of my storage needs.</Review>

<Text>These folks are a godsend for anyone needing more space now that they're at home a lot more. We did clutter for a while, but MakeSpace makes it much easier with their provided bags, and they're better at photographing your stuff.< /Text><date>1595542874774<//date></record></dataset><record>

< review>
If you are looking to use Makespace, think again -- consider other more reliable options. Makespace truly was storage without a struggle, up until pick up. Post the pickup, it went downhill....

My appointment was about a month ago, but I still have not gotten any confirmation from the team about my things in storage (supposed to take 3 days or so). When I reached out to CS after week 2 , they said 4 of my items are still being processed and "they don't know why." They said they reached out to ops to process, but I'm still waiting. Although they were kind, CS just made me worry more, because they sounded clueless themselves --didn't seem like they had the info they need to help. I was also told  "there was very little I can do for the unprocessed items."

What am I supposed to do? Just hope that I can get my stuff back some day?

Cherry on top --  based on the photos of my items currently posted by Makespace, it should be more than 4 items that still need to be processed. Alas, it's hard to tell, because the team packed a bunch of things in their own box without labeling what is inside...I tried to ask my CS rep to help me find out what's inside, to no avail.

They closed their support phone lines, so I can't reach anyone in person. A few days ago I expressed my concern that I'm worried my stuff is missing & asked if something is going on at the warehouse ...no response.

I get that their demand is crazy due to COVID. People at the company must be stressed. If that is the case and so things are just hectic and there are significant issues, Makespace should have just let me & other customers know so at least we can wait in peace while hopefully they figure things out. It's really frustrating having to spend so much time & mindshare to ensure a storage company, well, actually stored my things. I'm just glad I didn't store any important documents.

The movers who showed up were truly fantastic though --showed up on time, super polite, got my things out of my apartment really fast. My rep who assisted up to my pickup, was also great. I'm sad to be leaving such a bad review.</review>

< review>
I wish I could give Makespace 0 stars. I booked a pickup several weeks in advance, provided as much information as possible, and made it clear I lived in SF where parking and traffic are notoriously hectic. On the day of my move, Makespace arrived and called me to say they could not complete the pickup because "there was nowhere to park." This was absolutely untrue. I sent multiple pictures of places they could park, but they clearly did not feel like completing my pickup. This put me in an incredibly difficult situation where I had to personally book a uhaul and do the move myself. And what do you know - we had absolutely no trouble parking the 12' Uhaul. Makespace is a shady business with no regard for the customer. Also keep in mind, they do not take a deposit, which essentially means they can pull stuff like this and they aren't on the hook. 0 stars - do not take the risk with these guys.<//review>

<text>Horribly deceiving company. First, they took one extra box from me which I told them not to, and without my consent, they upgraded the space because they said my initial choice wasn't enough. Because of that one extra box they took, I went from 400 cubric feet to 600 cubric feet. So they've been charging me $249 a month instead of $169. Second, I went back to their website and checked the price. On the website, 600 cubric feet is quoted at $169. I noticed that I've been paying almost $100 more than what the website says. When I contacted them, they said "that's the price you are locked up." And they were not willing to change. I feel so deceived by how they do business and I lost trust. I have absolutely no willingness to recommend this company to anyone.< /text>< pictures>

<Response>{'time': 1565822940497, 'text': "Hi Mari,\n\nI'm so sorry that your experience with MakeSpace hasn't lived up to the high standards we hold ourselves to. I've asked a member of our Customer Support team to reach out to you directly tomorrow so we can make this right.\n\nQuoted prices are based on a number of factors, including the location of your first pickup as well as when you signed up for MakeSpace. Because your rates are locked in at the time of pickup, we guarantee that your rates will never increase for the same plan. In this instance, I see that the items picked up measured into a slightly larger storage plan, which led to the increased price. I'm truly sorry for any inconvenience this caused, however I'm confident that we'll be able to make this right.\n\nAs a follow-up, a member of our team will reach out tomorrow with additional information and next steps.\n\nAll the best,\n\nSean\nCustomer Experience Manager"}< /Response>< gmapID>
