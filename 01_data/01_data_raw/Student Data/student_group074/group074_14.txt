My frustrations with PPM are outlined as follows:

Poor customer service: Often times PPM does not post photos of inside of apartments, are not able to provide basic information about apartments such as square footage. There is not a direct line to speak with the person who is processing your application for questions. They will answer text messages, but generally only one text every 2-3 hours, and will only answer 1 question even if you ask 3. Overall very inefficient processing of applications.

False Advertising: Apartments that were listed as "available now" we found out may not be ready for move in for 2-3 months. Although a site may be listed as available, 7/7 properties that we requested already had approvals for other tenants to live there.

Generally not flexible: Unwilling to accommodate minor changes in rental agreements like month-month leases, unwilling to schedule showings on weekends. Move in dates listed set in stone, not open to negotiation.

Conclusion: I tried long and hard to work with this company to get an apartment as the application was fairly expensive ($84 for a couple) but it turned out to be a huge waste of time and money. As a traveling health care professional, I live in many different apartments nationally and appreciate efficient processing of applications and good communication. If any of these things are priorities for selecting your apartment, save yourself some money and a headache - consider other companies before PPM.</text>

I'm just wondering how they are still open? This is RPM NOW, seems like they haven't changed a bit, same company with a different letter in it. It makes me bit nervous to go through them now. I'm giving one star for bad communication skills, not responding to me, and it looks like I am not the only one. If they don't respond now, what will happen when I apply and pay 150 bucks for us to get a place. Will we get a place at all? or will we be here 3 months from now still looking? No thanks, I will go through a smaller company. I do hope they get better with communication, and respond to who ever has applied already. Good luck to you all that are having to go through a mess just to get a place.<//text>

<Review>I worked with PPM for years, and gave them thousands of dollars as my management company of three properties I own in Eureka. I found them to be very uncooperative when listening to my concerns, and even less cooperative when it comes to helping me keep my property rented. I was constantly having to list my own property and feed them the prospects.
The straw that broke the camels back, was their maintenance dept. Not only are they completely incompetent, they are rude as hell! DO NOT!!! let these people run your business for you, be proactive and lookout for yourself, its usually all you got. The worst of the worst, the accounting. And frankly isn't that what its all about, the money. Don't let them steal your money!  Renters beware, Landlords be warned.</Review>< Pictures>

You repeatedly submit your paperwork, send them the check for the application fee, then they trick you into believing that you get the apartment, to stop returning your calls, then call out of the blue to say the apartment was rented. I find them to be very dishonest, the fee is non refundable, so they end up profiting from keeping all those application fees.

<Review>If it were possible to give this barely legitimate company a rating using a negative number of stars then I would. However, a one star rating is the lowest I can give and even that seems generous. This is unquestionably THE WORST property management company I have ever been forced to do business with. I cannot overstate my displeasure with this company and every employee of theirs that I have ever interacted with. I seriously wish that God would call down the ten plagues upon the employees and representatives of this two bit circus act. Avoid at all costs.< /Review>< pictures>

<Rating>1</Rating><review>If you have the choice of another rental company, take it. My wife and I only went through them be we didn't. We talked to other companies  who were more professional and courteous than this one. But the houses were either out of our price range or they didn't have listings available for months. They had sour attitudes; they always sounded bothered by the fact we asked question about their listings. Some of their houses would stay online months, then when we applied for them they would say they had been taken by other renters but the listing would continue to stay online. On top of that they would take weeks to get back to us with a response which was mostly no. Use these people as a last resort, once you have no other options, that's what we did.<//review>< pictures>

<response>{'time': 1490988319997, 'text': "Salvador, we have tried to reach out to you but haven't heard back. I apologize if you found the selection process frustrating. We can feel the same way. We are an agent for the owner, not the owner. This means our job is to process applicants and make recommendations to the owner's of the properties of applicants. We unfortunately do not own any of the properties we manage which means that for the majority of properties, an owner makes the decision on the renter, not us. The rental market is extremely competitive which means there are multiple people applying for every property. Because of that, it can take some time to be selected.  In the future there may be a quicker way to place tenants, but as long as there are more renters than properties available, this is going to be the case.\n\nI also see you said attitudes of some of the staff was unpleasant. That is something we can fix. If you have dealt with us recently you should have noticed a difference. You created your maintenance request Saturday when our office is closed and we are handled it within 48 hours. If you still feel the same about your review thank you for your thoughts. If you think it would be fair to include some of your other experiences with us that were positive we would appreciate that as well.

<Review>The worst property management I've ever dealt with. My boyfriend has rented with this company for over 2 years. He's signed the papers and contracts needed stating that he is a tenant. When repairs were needed, ppm would never call his phone, only the other tenant who signed the contract as well. This would happen multiple times when repairs or maintenence were needed. We thought nothing of it till one day... when another property company called ppm to verify that my boyfriend has rented with this company, ppm said that he basically doesn't exist in our system and that his name isn't on the current unit's contract.. thus, preventing my boyfriend from being accepted to a new home that he was in first place for and something he so much needed. Thank you ppm. You have no idea how hard it is for someone to find a home in such a competitive area. My boyfriend and the other tenant BOTH have proof of the written contract and he will make several copies to prove he exists in your system..... just the fact that we even HAVE to do that is such a pain and isn't right. "Thank you for voting us best property management for 3 years in a row!" Complete lie, look at the amount of one star reviews this management has recieved. Do not waste your time and money with this management. I suggest look else where.</Review><gmap_id>0x54d3ffecca610871:0x29d5b70d2e706720<//gmap_id><time>1508178337786</time>< pictures>

I never leave negative comments for businesses BUT people need to know how horrible this company is! I have only been a tenant for 4 months and I am counting down the days until my lease is up! I have had problems with my bathtub faucet leaking very bad, it fills my bathtub up every day and clearly doesn’t drain well. A guy came out and said he would be back and it has been 2 months! I called last Friday and told them the problem is still their and they said they would send someone out......it’s been a week and I haven’t heard from anyone! My bathtub is growing mold now and yes the are aware of this which is a health issue! This company doesn’t return calls or try and help tenants. It is so sad how a company can get away with treating people like this. I will take fault because plenty of people warned me not to rent from them and I did anyways. I learned my lesson and I just hope people will please read all of these negative reviews and do not give this company business.<//Text>

<Review>I'm going to start this review by saying that I am a very patient person. I have never spent time and energy in writing a negative review.

So, with that said, avoid PPM like the plague. I paid over $150+ on my application over four weeks ago. I called four days in a row and on the fourth day I called they finally told me that my application was still being processed after weeks of waiting. Do not wait for them to 'process' your application. Because PPM, myself and two of my other friends are now homeless. We are all very well off college students who can each afford a place of our own individually. Being very well off financially I never thought I'd say that I'm currently homeless. Thanks PPM.

The part that bugs me the most is that we have no idea whether we will be accepted or not. How long do we have to wait? Two or three months to find out? Chances are we will be denied for the house we applied for and then we will have to apply to another house which will probably take another month for them to process our application. I'm going to give them another call tomorrow and downgrade to a house that none of my roommates want. We are already invested in ppm so might as well. In the meantime I'll be searching for places to live on my own, which I should have done in the first place. But who knows, ppm may still surprise me. Until then this review stands. Do not go through PPM regardless of how much you want to live in the apartment/house they are renting out. Unless you have months to wait and money to blow on an application stand clear.

Your best bet to finding houses in Humboldt is through word of mouth. So post advertisements around churches and the co-op "seeking housing" and you'll probably get contacted by someone sooner or later. Better than going through PPM.

UPDATE: I spoke to Amy on the phone awhile back. She seems to be keeping this company together. Not only did she call me and tell me the reason why my application took so long, SHE FOLLOWED THROUGH and texted me personally a few days later about the rental I applied for. I'm adding an extra star for Amy.< /Review><Name>Joshua Mata<//Name><pictures>None</pictures>< Time>

< review>
Very sketchy, had a routine maintenance inspection 3 months ago and passed with flying colors because I updated and fixed some things wrong with my rental.

The minute I go out of town, the landlord submits a request to have my place inspected again and PPM will not let it wait until I get back from my vacation so I can be there and ensure nothing of mine gets stolen.

Very Shady.<//review>

{'time': 1509482663334, 'text': "My name is Darus Trutna and I am the President of PPM. I am sorry you had a frustrating experience applying for one of our rentals. We often allow applicants to view properties as they are being cleaned and repaired so people can see if it is something they might be interested in once it is ready to rent and don't waste their time waiting to find out. The home you toured, and all of our rentals, abide by strict cleanliness and rent-ready standards. I also realize how frustrating it is to not be selected to rent a property. Unfortunately we often have more than one application for a property. We would love to be able to rent a property to every single applicant, but that is unfortunately not the case. If you are still interested in one or more of our properties we recommend switching your property of interest as often as you'd like.\n\nJust so you know a little about me, I was born and raised in Humboldt, I am an Army Veteran with an overseas deployment, and I am proud to be part of a local business working to continuously raise our standards so that we may better serve community members like you.\n\nI read every review and it hurts me and my team to think that we have dissatisfied you.

<Review>LIES AFTER LIES!
Do not rent through PPM. Despite all other people saying it, since I've rented from them before I gave them the benefit of the doubt and applied through them again and it's been 1 1/2 years, paid application fee twice now and everything was ok til we stopped searching for a few months and just recently emailed them to add a property to our application just to be told we have been denied renting with them. Like what? Aren't y'all supposed to send out a letter or email explaining the reason. We have been approved renting with them for over a year and a half and out of the blue we found a place they finally have that is interested to us and they tell us we can't rent through them because we have been denied to rent with them without any explanation why. They take your application money just to screw you over. I guess they have been really messed up recently. I've never had an issue with ppm but I guess they really have been unprofessional. Do not waste your time with them. Save your money for a different property management. This one isn't worth it. Especially since our search has been over a year and a half with 2 application payments already. N it's $40 per application. BOGUS! SCAM SCAM SCAM SCAM.

I can't believe they claim to have sent me a letter explaining why our applications been denied to rent with them in Sept 2017 when clearly, I would know if I received one. And we were told we have been approved to rent thru them back last year in April 2016 then never found a home we liked so we ended up having to pay the fee again n renew our application in may 2017 and told we are good but then now they claim we have been denied in Sept after our application was submitted?  Save ur time n do not deal with this so-call professional property management. 😠😠😠😠😠< /Review>< Pictures>

As per company policy, we are fully refunding the Tenant's rent as of the day the unit became uninhabitable. We have communicated recommendations to the Tenant for finding housing. Regarding fire safety, here is the excerpt from our Rental Agreement.\n------------------------\nSMOKE DETECTOR(S) AND CARBON MONOXIDE DETECTORS\nTenant acknowledges that they have received the Premises with an operating smoke detector(s) and carbon monoxide detectors in accordance with Civil Code 17926 (b). Tenant agrees not to disable any of the smoke detectors or carbon monoxide detectors in the unit and agrees to replace the batteries in the detector(s) as needed. Tenant agrees to periodically test and notify the Landlord of any malfunctions in the detector(s).\n-----------------------\nIt is incredibly unfortunate that this fire occurred, we are thankful that no one was hurt. This struck a chord with our entire team and we are starting a Fire Safety Campaign to remind the community of the importance of smoke detectors: how important it is to not disarm them and how vital it is to conduct regular tests."}< /resp>

boyfriend lived in a ppm rental for the last 8 years there was an accent and the kitchen caught fire, thankfully for my dog she was able to wake us up and she saved us and the house... it is very sad that this company's reaction is to put us out and not let is be placed into a different rental... this company is a joke and i dont see how they are in business still... we have kids a dog turtle and fish and now we are paying to live in a hotel on our own expense... after 8 years of renting thru this company what a damn joke...< /review>

<text>Everyone gives PPM such a hard time, and I have no doubt some people have been left feeling treated unfairly. However, my experience with PPM has been nothing but straight forward and honest. Sure it took them a bit longer to approve my application, but they have 100s to process and it is ultimately up to the property owner to make a decision. I had issues with my laundry room being broken in to, they came that day and changed the locks. I foolishly locked myself out of my apartment and they were there within two hours to change my locks and provide me with a new set of keys. Pretty standard property management if you ask me. Just like with credit cards, most people dig themselves in to their own holes then blame  the company for providing a service. I like PPM and will continue to rent from them in the future. Beats the hell out of the slum lords who rent properties here while living in San Francisco.</text></record></dataset><record>

Absolutely terrible. Poor communication; we weren't in the area when looking for an apartment, and it'd take a week for them to email us back for 6 months. We would've moved a lot sooner if they had gotten back to us within a reasonable amount of time. And they lied to us. They said the gas was included in the rent, and there was no on site laundromat. The gas wasn't included, and there was a laundromat. And we only found out because the maintenence guy told us and we had to get a key to it from him! Worst service we've ever gotten in our lives. We only dealt with the them, because they were the only company with available apartments.</review>

You are a horrible, horrible company! I hope that one day, very soon, the BBB closes your doors.
First off, your 7-10 business days for approval/denial is a bold faced lie. You're more than prompt at taking your $42 processing fee. Your even fantasic on your very first reply, 'so looking forward to working with you'.
And after that, you may as well be talking to the wall! Your response time to phone calls/text/emails is non-existant. The fact that everyone who will be living in the house MUST text you which house you are interested in, is mental.
At one point, you had ever member of my family interested in differnt house, no matter how many times we tried to correct your information, it was wrong
So here we sit, over a month later,  with not a stitch of help from your company.
Oh, that's not true.  I lied.  You messaged my son this morning,  that YET AGAIN, the property we wanted is already spoken for.
Don't use this company.  You're better off doing your own footwork.
I do believe the positive reviews for this company are falsified.  It's probably employees trying to bury the truth.
And don't bother trying to find who I am,  PPM (as I've seen you do that before) My rental app was in with my whole family.  Which I'll be more than happy to provide you with,  should you need to verify that I was an actual customer.</Text>

<Review>So I'm in the process of looking for a new place to live in Humboldt and by just reading these reviews and seeing that the management is apologizing to every other reviewer just sets off a red flag.

Thus by far the worst place anyone can rent through, very unprofessional with a lack of communication. Iv read every bad review about this place and try to give it chance but everything you read about this place is true. They take your money for application fee and if you didn't a get a place, they will not notify you at all what so ever.<//Review>

Horrible company if could give negative score would. Couldn't get documents together after 2 months trying.</text>
<Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>{'time': 1520648327333, 'text': 'Hey Greg - I am sorry you feel you had a poor experience, I can see from our communications that we were awaiting documents from all Tenants in order to move forward with your addition to the Tenancy, and once recieved - we were awaiting all the signatures from all Tenants, all of which was completed in December. I can completely understand the confusion- adding and removing Tenants from an existing contract is very complicated- which is why it is a service not even offered by many property management companies. Your feedback is very helpful, we will work on more clearly conveying the process; we would like it to be easier and more transparent. We are very sorry you are frustrated and thank you very much for taking the time to give us feedback!'}<//Response><Gmap_id>0x54d3ffecca610871:0x29d5b70d2e706720< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Just don't bother. Waste of time & money. Straight answers are so hard to come by if you get one. Super high app fee, if not the highest. You'll get further banging your head against a wall than trying to work with this company.< /Review>

Applied and left messages, they are impossible to get ahold of. Your credit check that you are supposedly paying for is supposed to be public and we were never even contacted after the 3-5 days they say it takes to run your information.</Text>

I love the place, it's full with dbz figures and video games. The only thing they should change is the place, they could at least move somewhere else because around they are at is a dangerous place to be so besides that its a place to go if you want games😁😁😀😀👍👍<//review>

Cheap prices for games, get hook ups from my friends that works here. Releases new games a week before any other game stores. No need to be on a wait list for games to be out like others store such as game-stop.</review>

<review>This is on the 50-50 side of my experience they have a good selection and games up the prices are questionable there's no restrooms and no parking in the customer service is basically nonexistent the lack of English year is very poor and they really need to work on that if you're looking for a hole in the wall video game shop you found it but if you're looking for a high selection and videogames you may not find it here so look elsewhere but the prices will keep bringing you back.<//review>< Gmap_id>

My Tax preparer Stephanie  was amazing to work with and she handled my laziness and my not being prepared for taxes this year gracefully. Stephanie worked around my delays and got the job done. The cost is extremely reasonable.  I will be back next year, even if only to show Stephanie that I am usually much more organized and prepared come tax time!< /review>

Kathy Burns provided excellent service.  She did a great job taking me through the final product of my federal and state tax returns.  She answered all my questions and did not rush me through the process.  She was very professional and courteous.</Review>

After dropping off all required papers to file my taxes on Friday, I was told to expect a call no later than Sunday. It was already Tuesday and I called simply to get an update. Judy answered the phone, I kindly asked if she could give me an update on my taxes. After she heard my name, Martinez, she immediately cut me off and proceeded to tell me, out of nowhere, that "If you don't like it you can come and get your paperwork." Obviously I felt very uncomfortable because I've been doing my taxes with H&R Block for the past 13 years and I should've treated that way. I then requested to talk to Mindy, the manager, who showed no care about the situation, instead she justified Judy, and told me that it was because of my tone. Thankfully, I made the call from my living room, where I have a surveillance camera, and it documented everything. There was no attitude or rudeness from my end. Judy was extremely prejudice, and as other reviews here reflect about her. She is very unprofessional and unkind.

Furthermore, In seems that Judy's attitude is an overall representation of how they treat their customers. From the receptionist, all the way up to the manager Mindy. They're very selective and profiling when it come to treatment and customer care. It is very likely, as it happened to me, that someone with a different last name or lack of accent would've gotten a complete different response and attitude. Very disappointed about the lack of care about the people in this office.< /text>

Luis Aguirre has been a pleasure to work with. Paul the office Manager is also exceptional. I also enjoy the receptionist, she is kind, sweet funny and professional. I was pleased to learn that preparation fees had gone down and that was also a pleasant surprise and an added savings.My returns were accepted very fast and I don't owe anything !< /Review>

Randy Diaz is the reason.  He is very patient and doesn't rush you.  He answered all my questions.  Even more importantly, he really listened to my needs and came up with solutions.  I made the final decisions but he offered options.  He also discussed next year with me which gave me confidence going forward.  He is a great representative for H&R Block.</Text>

Like many of us, I was overdue for a haircut.  I stumbled upon this place (that was open!) and after a very short wait, received a marvelous cut.  She actually added some additional styling, which made the style even better.  I'm extremely satisfied with the service and results!<//text>

<Resp>None</Resp><review>Took my 2 year old son there for a quick haircut. The person helping us was Dora and we loved her. She was friendly, took time to listen and did an excellent job. I’ll be taking my 7 year old daughter there from next time as well. Will definitely be back on a regular basis. Price was very reasonable - $13 for kids.< /review><rate>5</rate><pics>None<//pics>< user>

Been going to the Haircut for years. Good for men's haircuts by all stylists.  They're open to 7pm each day, so quite easy to fit into my work schedule.<//text>

< review>
I have curly hair and I always ask to cut my hair dry and only with scissors.  This is because straight wet hair curls up in awkward ways when dries up. Haircutters normally persuade me to relax the conditions or they throw a disclaimer.  Very few people do the job properly.  So I normally stick with one or two proven ones.  I lost them recently as they have moved on.
So I tried "The Haircut".  Haircutter, Dora is long experienced, very pleasant and did a perfect job.  This is the second time and she is consistent so far.<//review>

The men who work in the garage portion of this business are wonderful! My car was heating up (not quite overheating, but above the norm) so I pulled in here. When I asked the man how much they would charge me to check my fluids and he just started checking them and even gave me a plug for a missing dipstick without charging me a dime! When I tried to give him some money as a gratuity he wouldn't let me. I was more than pleased with their service! The only reason they don't have 5 stars is because the actual gas station and convenience store closes pretty early but if you have a card and only want gas it's not really an issue.< /review>

These people have taken care of my car since I moved to Palm Springs 8 years ago... I have been treated fairly and with respect... even when I ask them the silliest questions.  They have kept me and my 1998 Rav4 on the road in my beautiful Palm Springs. Thank you folks for your great work and care...</Review>

If you're looking for an honest smog shop, the Mobil station of Palm Springs is the best. Before I was referred to this smog shop by a relative, I had tried out a couple of other smog shops in the area, one of which failed my car by disconnecting various components. Anyway, I've been coming here for the last couple of years and it's always been a pleasant experience.< /text>

I thought I'd check this place out. Our first time here tonight. The menu was not what I expected. It was not only dirty and sticky but also hard to picture what the food would look like. I had to check on Google to check what others had ordered. The house salad with crabmeat was good. The Alaska Roll,  (Salmon), the rice was too soft, so it would fall off when I picked it up with the chopsticks. The Protein Roll my hubby ordered looked like a great size of the protein. He also got Cold Sake 300ml, in a bottle for a ridiculous price! We didn't know how much it was until we got the bill.
House Salad $4.95, with crabmeat $3.00; Protein Roll $23.95; Alaska Roll $13.95; and the cold Sake for $13.95. So today I checked online to write this review, I realized the menu prices were lower than what they charged us. This is ridiculous! Also, putting the chairs on the table before we could leave, was a sign to get out I guess. I don't think we will come back.<//Review>

A hidden gem.  You can't see it from the street. It's behind Burger King.  Very clean, casual, cozy atmosphere, excellent service,  fresh and delicious food.  The owner J is very nice, pleasant and makes you feel welcome. The food is fresh and yummy.   A must go. You will not regret.< /Text>

Poke bowl of crab, scallops and tuna, tempura shrimp and vegetables and miso soup. Perfectly prepared and hot and delicious. Had a wonderful chat with the owner and mentioned that my husband had served  in Japan for 4 years during the Korean War. As I was leaving, he said to please tell him Thank you for his service, as he was Korean. Will be back very soon.< /text><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

<review>My wife is Japanese, my son is half Japanese and the three of us love sushi. We came here to get our grind on and we were disappointed.

The sushi was good. The restaurant was clean. The parking was safe. The problem was with the people who work there and with how they present their establishment.

The place has a Japanese name. When you enter, you are greeted by enthusiastic shouts of greeting in Japanese. When you leave, you are given words of “thanks" in Japanese. Turns out nobody who works here speaks a lick of Japanese beyond those few words.

As we were seated after a short wait, my wife began to chat in a friendly manner to our server, in Japanese. The server said “what?!” and looked at her with a look or disgust. The server said flatly, “I don’t speak Japanese.”

This Japanese sushi shop is run by Korean Americans who are presenting themselves as Japanese people running a Japanese sushi shop.

After that brief exchange our server was much less than friendly and her conversation with us was kept at a bare minimum for the rest of our meal.

Our sushi chef was a Korean American guy named Jeff. Really.

The only reason this bothered me was because everybody who wasn’t Japanese were pretending that they were. My Family felt deceived.

In short, the meal was good. Prices were average. The place felt traditional but knowing it is all just a show kind of soured it. Our server developing an attitude for being caught kind of soured it.

And that's that.<//review><Response>None</Response><userid>110249086757022351631< /userid><username>severin murphy< /username>< rating>

Domo Sushi

If you're hungry and craving sushi in Anaheim Hills but certainly don't want to break your bank, then this is the place for you.

One of the things I like about this restaurant is that it offers BOGO 50% off duplicate rolls, meaning if you order 2 California rolls then one of them would be half off. The quality of the sushi, however, is nothing more than average. Decent portions but nothing about their sushi leaves me wanting more.

It's a very small restaurant in here so it can get pretty packed very easily as they only have seating for about 30 people or so, including the bar. The service wasn't amazing and the waiter hovers over you from a distance which kind of made it very intimidating to order my meal because he was waiting so long nearby.

I love to order miso soup and edamame as an appetizer and while the edamame was perfectly boiled and salted, the miso soup was far too salty in my opinion. I wouldn't immediately cast this restaurant aside as it is a decent place to dine, but at the rate I'm paying I'd rather pay for AYCE sushi.</review>

Wow, my first Sushi experience and one I will be returning for asap.
Fantastic staff and mega helpful. They are on hand to explain any item you are unsure of and will help guide you in the correct direction. Food is prepared in view from tables, meaning you feel more connected to what you enjoy< /text>

<Review>Seriously? All these good reviews? My son and I went here on a Sunday evening based on the reviews we saw here. The first hint was that we were the only customers there when we looked in the door. We sat down anyway, and looked through the menu, but did not see a sushi combo dinner that we saw online. The menu didn't quite match. But we got up and left without further ado because of the stench of old grease permeating the place. It smelled worse than a decades old greasy spoon diner. We couldn't get beyond the odor and almost lost our appetite for dinner completely.< /Review>< rate>

<Review>This place isn't what it used to be. Sushi rice had a strange texture, some of it was squishy and some of it was hard, like from a cheap rice cooker. Vinegar taste in the rice was far too strong. Something in the kitchen burned, which left a funky smell. Then something smelled like bleach for half the meal, which was extremely unappetizing. I might give this another go if they bring back the takoyaki.<//Review>< pictures>

Always enjoy getting Sushi from Bruce or Jay menu has a pretty wide variety of different food items and it's fresh, good, and well priced. There may be some better Sushi places out there but you'll definitely be spending a lot more.<//Review>

<Time>1543116146744<//Time><Rate>3< /Rate><Review>I sat at the sushi bar and we ordered straight through the sushi chef. We ordered a few Nigiri pieces: unagi, ebi, and bluefin tuna. On all of the Nigiri pieces the rice wasn't prepared right, it had a heavy vinegar tang that overpowered the fish and was pretty mushy, which would make the Nigiri fall apart when grabbed with chopsticks. I also think the rice wasn't cooled properly as the rolls came to us a bit warm.

We ordered the Domo roll and it was a bit bland but had good textures and good intentions. They forgot my cucumber roll, I asked them to add wasabi to the maki (as it was missing from the Nigiri) and he added so much it was unpleasant. He comped the cucumber maki, which was kind of him... But I don't think I'll return or add this to my list of favorite sushi restaurants anytime soon.

The good parts of Domo is the fresh fish and friendly service.< /Review>< pictures>

< review>
I've gotten to know the recover industry well during my off and on struggles in life. The recovery scene in this area is huge. Pacific shores is in a great location, close to the Costa Mesa and Newport Beach Alano clubs, and also close to the free way beach and stores.

The first time I was sober for a good length of time I was happy to do so in this area. I am so grateful to be staying at pacific shores. Honestly, compared to other recovery homes and centers I've visited and stayed at, pacific shores is amazing. It's great to be in an environment where I am surrounded by others who understand what I'm going through and are also pulling their lives back together. Working with addicts and alcoholics is no easy thing to deal with. I can say everyone involved here has the understanding and insight into the baffling and insidious things we can do to ourselves.

While I don't believe you can throw money at every problem, you can absolutely put yourself in an environment that can push you in the direction you need to go in. I'm super glad I'm here. I'm still super afraid to go back. I desperately don't want to feel the way I did before. I'm glad I am here.</review>

Awesome staff and people at this facility. All around the atmosphere is very friendly and a great place for recovery. If you’re looking for a clean sober living and people to hold you accountable in your road to recovery this is the place for you. Big book study is three days a week and plenty of help finding employment. Choice of single or double room with a roommate and the rooms are kept clean. Overall a great experience.< /Review>

<Review>Going to Pacific Shores was one of the best decisions of my life. For the time I was there I learned so much not only regarding my sobriety but tools to be the best version of myself.
Staff is genuine, kind, and loving. I will forever appreciate the help they gave me and highly recommend this place! If you want a peaceful, warm, and helpful environment this is the place to go. Thank you so much for everything you guys did for me!<//Review>< pictures>

<Text>I onced lived at pacshores for a good amount of time. The managers were awesome, the housing is clean, the people were great- the meetings on site 3 times a week really kept the recovery and community tight. Great place to reside if you’re new in recovery or experienced and trying to get back on your feet.

The staff is excellent and very helpful and you can tell they actually care about you as a person. Most sober livings only care about getting the rent check. Here, staff such as Dakota are involved to help you stay on the right path. The residents here are mostly people who actually care about staying sober and take recovery serious. I appreciate everything pacific shores did for me because hey helped me get back on my feet.< /review>< Pics>

<review>Pacific shores is the only place I've lived, outside of my parents' house as a kid, that truly feels like home.  I have a supportive community around me.  I live with people who think like me and share my goals.  The house is staffed with people who are devoted to happily and energetically helping me and the other residents.  I have people to keep me accountable and go to meetings with me.  The other residents and I help each other.  The people around the house are respectful, and that's a rarity in the early sobriety community.  I've had a few things around the house need to be fixed up, and they were dealt with as soon as I brought them up.  I was even thanked for asking to have them fixed.  In the house, I have all the freedom we need to do what I need to do, but with accountability to stay sober and maintain my life.  But the best part is, I get to see miracles every day in other addicts and alcoholics healing, and it inspires me to stay sober and be the best person I can be.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x80dcdf8cecf9e71d:0xde46181f8719920a<//gmap_id></record>

The men that run Pacific Shores Recovery / Sober Living are serious about RECOVERY. They have an open door policy and the staff is readily available anytime of day if you need to talk about whatever the case may be. It’s a great environment and you are surrounded by others that are serious about their recovery. They keep you accountable, while still allowing you the freedom to go about your day. Would highly recommend their sober living as the next indicated step in anyone’s journey after treatment.

Thanks to Pacific Shores for allowing me another stepping stone in my recovery/ sobriety journey .< /Text>

I am grateful for finding Pacific Shores sober living. Pacific Shores allowed me to get on my feet and move towards a life of recovery. I am leaving Pacific Shores after a 4 month stay with a solid foundation and memories to last a lifetime. I would also like to thank Lenny and Dakota (house coordinators) for helping me through my recovery process and making my stay comfortable and enjoyable. I will highly recommend Pacific Shores sober living to anyone who is ready for this phase of their life.< /review>

I am currently living at Pacific Shores sober living house in Costa Mesa. I have been here for 1 month, and it is going great. The houses are kept very clean, and everyone is expected to be responsible for their own recovery, and treat each other with respect. The management seems to truly care about how I am doing.</Review>

I was apprehensive and nervous coming out of treatment. Pac shores welcomed me in and I felt right at home. I now have over 8 months of sobriety and just moved on to my own apartment! My time at Pacific shores got me on my feet and helped me set a strong foundation. Thank you Pacific shores!<//review>

​  ​what we are dealing with here are ​real ​people's lives​.
​ ​So if you know someone that has the problem ​with any type of addiction, whether it be drugs or alcohol​,​  ​     I would definitely reach out to Pacific Shores and the​ir​ recovery team.
This is not a treatment center that ​I​ call a drive by treatment center.
This is a recovery Center that relish is on the idea that they can change​ peoples lives one person at a time.
While attending over 7​,​000 AA meetings in the Orange County and seeing first hand the revolving door that does happen in recovery I stake  my reputation I'm putting Pacific Shores ahead of any other facility.
The one thing they constantly do is breathalyze and drug test all residents no matter who you are or where you're from.
They have one primary purpose and that is to get the individual clean and sober and put them on the right path of staying clean and sober​. Remember this is a new way of living, and people will need to make drastic changes, since usually up to this point, Plan A hasn't worked out that well.​
We have a saying in any 12 step recovery meeting,  and that is "meeting makers" make it.
Pacific Shores of adamant about their meetings and the attendance of the individuals and try to make it to some of the best meetings and all of the United States.
There are more meetings in Orange County than any other place in the United States​,​ and that's what makes recovery at this facility so great.
​  Because of many factors, getting sober in Orange County is one thing.
But staying sober is the long-term goal at Pacific Shores.
God bless you, and good luck.​< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80dcdf8cecf9e71d:0xde46181f8719920a< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Deciding to go to Pac Shores has been hands down one of the best decisions I’ve made in my life. Coming from a residential treatment center where I was more of a number to Pac Shores where I was treated on individual level was exactly what I needed to truly work on myself. The therapists, case managers, and support staff sincerely care about you and are what makes this place shine. I’ll be forever grateful to the people here who helped me open my eyes and show me how to live a happy sober life.<//Text>

I have been a resident at Pac shores for one month. Everyone in my house is serious about recovery and we go to meetings together. I would recommend this house to anyone looking for a nice, safe place to get sober and stay sober.< /Review>

The place its self was outstanding, all the staff were helpful. My only delema was the fact that the owner told me i was going to complete the program and coin out the entire time i was there but come to find out on my last day i didnt complete it for some reason. They told me they just didnt want me to complete which basically means they just wanted more insurance money from me. God bless, make a wise decision for yourself and go to a place that actually cares because they dont.<//Text>

I loved living at Pac Shores! Definitely somewhere I would recommend to someone seeking treatment. I had been struggling with addiction and relapse for years before coming to Pac Shores. It was there I found a home that felt safe enough to work through some of my biggest struggles with PTSD and triggers that I dealt with on a daily basis. I now have 8 months sober, working full time and saving up to move out into my own apartment. Ive come a VERY long way since I first got to Pacific Shores. The staff were always so friendly and Ive definitely made a second home and family out of the clincal team, staff and alumni at Pacific Shores!< /Text>

<text>I've been living here for a few months. Really a great place to get back on your feet in sobriety. Excellent environment for sober people to put some time together. Also great location in Costa Mesa off of 17th and Orange on Cabrillo st. next to a few grocerery stores and all the restaraunts on 17th, like Cafe Rio and the expensive yet always delicious doughnuts from Sidecar. There are AA and NA meetings close by. My house is very comfortable. Everyone here staff included are sober, held accountable and working strong programs.

Also shout out to the A Team of Pac Shores. Dakota, Ken, Lenny, Charlie, Dale and Mark Senior.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x80dcdf8cecf9e71d:0xde46181f8719920a</gmap_id></record>

<Review>This place has pastries.

Tried both the pumpkin and red bean with mochi pastries. The pumpkin was fresh made, not canned and not like pumpkin pie but like kombucha--a light sweetness.

The red bean with mochi filling was very sweet, in a good way, with a wonderful, glutinous mouthfeel.

Also came for their thick and thin green onion pancakes. Both are good--the thin ones are more about the crispy texture, the thick ones are more about the green onions flavor.

The show stoppers were the pork belly bun and their green leek pastry which was a giant empanada stuffed with green onions, vermicelli, egg, and ground meat. Yum!< /Review>< Pics>

<Text>A home style dishes restaurant with a Taiwanese flavor in their cooking. And on Saturday they have a special breakfast menu that features soy milk, both sweet and salty versions, green onion pancakes, egg biscuits, beef biscuits, xiaolungbao, among others. The only place in Torrance with this offering.</Text>< pics>

<Review>Peter's Place is a traditional Taiwanese restaurant which offers a variety of dishes. The prices are reasonable and the portions are quite generous, too. It is perhaps one of the most authentic Chinese/Taiwanese restaurants in the South Bay area, that is why it is a rarity.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

I loved the flavors of all the dishes. Their soup dumplings are amazing. The pan fried dumplings come with a sweet and spicy sauce that's a good balance. They had the most flavorful house iced tea (Jasmine). I wasn't crazy about their sticky rice texture but I loved the flavors in the dish.< /Text>

Very complicated specials menu, where you don't get the bonus boba tea unless you pay cash. And you have to buy at least $20 to pay by card. It's all too much of a pain but the food is good and it's easy to park.< /text>

I took the kids for Saturday breakfast.  We used to get soy milk, egg pancake, rice roll in OC from 99 Ranch and this seems to be the only place to get soy milk for breakfast.

We were disappointed in the experience.  The soy milk tasted diluted, both the hot and cold one.  My 5 year old's comment is 'this tastes like water'.

The fried dough inside the rice roll was pretty tough instead of crunchy.  The egg pancake was good, the texture is more doughy than normal.

We came here for dinner awhile back, similar luke warm impression on food.  The restaurant is very cluttered, and as expected of old restaurant, you wondee about cleaniness.

The servers are nice, but when there are more than 3 tables, they seem to get overwhelm and get anxious at each other.<//Review>

<review>It seems like EWC just is a "mass production" company. It's hard to find someone there that does a job great with all the time pressure they get. I often have to do a final clean up once I get home.
Hoping Waxing the City will soon find their way to SD< /review>< pics>

It was definitely an okay spot.
The first eyebrow wax was free and it was okay.
But for $22 every two-three weeks? Because you know your girl has dark eyebrows and they grow fast.
Threading is definitely the way to go and for less.l, regardless of where you get your eyebrows threaded.<//Text>

Fruendly staff, Convenient location with close parking without having to walk through the whole mall.  Been going for almost a year.  Jade was my waxer this past time and was excellent.   Only 4 stars because bathroom faucet was broken last visit and didn't find out until my hands were all soaped.  Probably a random maintenance issue.</review>

Jade is AMAZING! She makes you feel very comfortable. She's definitely a people person and she knows what's she's doing.  I have been getting waxed by her for years now. EWC is very lucky to have Jade on their team.

Amy another one of their waxers is super cool too. She's funny and makes the little pain of getting waxed very minimal.<//Review>

< Review>
Prices went up. Sometimes the desk staff are new and don't know how to do things. They shouldn't be left alone until trained. It would be nice to be able to self check in, because waiting while someone is doing a contract is lame.<//Review>

<Review>Very snotty reception. Although I was late, I don’t need a lecture on how you had to move a girl’s break just so you could work me in. I’m not paying for a guilt trip. Either accommodate me or don’t. I’m not really trying to hear anything else. Curt, rude, and infuriating.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>{'time': 1562008636813, 'text': 'Hi Mia!

I tried calling the store and I'm deaf (hearing impaired) and I was trying to talk to the lady but I could barely hear what she was saying and then out of nowhere she asked "can you you hear me," hello?" And then hung up. I could tell she was faking it cause it sounded like she didn't want to talk on the phone. It's my graduation day Friday 14 at 10:30am all I wanted to do was get my eyebrows waxed now I can't even do that. That's just GREAT.< /Text>

<Text>A corporate waxing company that falls short when it comes to customer service. The receptionist/schedulers can’t even do something as basic as change your wax pass on the computer. Buyer beware don’t buy there wax passes. Bad customer service is there corporate policy. Waxers are clean and usually well mannered. If you want all the hair removed from any area this is not the place to go.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

I scheduled an appointment and was running a little late, even called to tell them I was on my way and this lady was acting like I wasn’t important and dismissed what I was saying, looking at me disrespectfully and she’s lucky I didn’t react how I wanted to.

<Review>Im super disappointed. Ive been going EWC in Anaheim for quite sometime and my girl there is gentle, professional and always checking in askng if the temp if the wax is okay, when to breathe ect. My 1st time here at mission valley i specifically asked for someone gentle and experienced. But i feel like a got a noob or someone overworked and exhausted from her day. She slathered the was on that was wayyyyy too hot, it definitely burned, and i told her a couple of times with complete disregard. And then she was just ripping it off like she was angry at it. My skin is so sensitive right now, i almost want to cry, like it hurts. If u wanted this kind of pain i would have went back to Pretty Kitty for their hot strip wax.</Review>< gmapID>

I hate to do this because the service was friendly, but the wax is just not for me, i feel like threading my eyebrows leaves my brows on highlight part more clean looking. I did get the wax for free the first visit, that was nice. The only thing was, i almost felt like my eyebrows turned out the same.  I did like that it was very private, it was a room like a room at a Dr, s visit with a big flat table you lay on, almost felt like i was going for a private check, but only for my eyebrows. ;]<//text>

<Review>Every time we order a to-go food , We have to wait very long. I think the restaurant should hire more people to work so that the customers don’t have to waste time to wait for 45 minutes sometimes even 1 hour.  It is very frustrating to wait for about 30 min - 1 hour during lunch time for one item order. I plan not to go there anymore. We do not want to waste 30-45 minutes sometimes even 1 hour to pick up the to-go food.  The restaurant should consider customer’s waiting time.  My family was a customer for many years but We are very unhappy about the service.< /Review><Rating>1< /Rating>< user_name>

I give this place a three star because of cleanliness and prompt service.  Food is tasty but saturated with fillers. They had a good flow of ”to-go” orders, and maybe we ordered the wrong food.  The General Chicken had an overpowering thick sauce, and the Egg flower soup was watery and not your typical Chinese soup.  The restaurant has so much potential, but it needs to step up its game and offer more somewhat of the real Chinese food taste like.  Btw, the Boba drinks were dissappiting, not flavorful and has an after taste.<//text>

<Review>Small but well spaced restaurant with classic tastefully executed dishes.

Simple menu keeps it easy and not overwhelming.

Fantastic service from lady at front counter great attitude and very knowledgable about the dishes.

Delicious milk tea for a reasonable price,
All around good pricing.

Deals of the day added a nice touch my coworker got his soft drink for free since we ordered more than 8$ worth of food.</Review>< Pictures>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Name>Brock Barkman</Name><Text>Looked around and found this place, The Boba House. Place is small, but food volume isn't. I ordered me a Kung Pao chicken rice bowl. What do ya know it, it tastes just like your typical $10 plus Chinese Restaurant! Food is wok prepared! Can't get that with most Chinese take out restaurants! I ate up, feel satisfied and went back on the road. I also got me a Capuccino smoothie as a dessert for the road! Will come back again if I'm here in town!<//Text>< Pictures>

This was my first time to this place, the woman working was very nice, and friendly. The food OMG it was fantastic...the vegtables in the rice bowls were fresh, and cooked perfectly with the right amount of crisp to them. I recommend this place if you like Chinese food.</text>

I have been visiting this place for the last 8 years. The portion is just perfect. Food is absolutely delicious. Kind owner and very friendly. We have tried most of their food in the menu including our fav KungPao Chicken. Also, do not forget to see the deal of the day. Sometimes you will get a free soda or wonton sup. Highly recomend place if you are craving for a tasty Chinese food.<//review>

The potstickers came out hot and were served with my boba drink. Shortly after my bowl was ready. It was also quite hot in temperature. Everything tasted good and had pretty sizeable portions. The place was spotless too! I'll definitely be coming back to try everything!</Review>< Pictures>

Great food and super friendly staff. Worth the journey out of Silicon Valley back to old California to go to this traditional location. Super fresh ingredients, nice decor and attentive service. All good.< /review>

<text>The People there were very nice, but my taco salad was big, but a bit flavorless.  The BBQ pork tasted as if it had sat around, dry and low on flavor.<//text>< Pictures>

Quick lunch place with avg-good Mexican offerings.  This seems to be the go-to place for Tivo employees.  Good Mexican beer selection that will help wash down a dozen or so of the street tacos.  🌮🍺</Text>

The tacos have gotten smaller and less tastee and the prices have gone up, there's also an additional charge if you use a credit card..... My friends and I would go there often, but not anymore, there are a lot of other taco places that offer better for for the same price.< /review>

<Review>They have a descent number of tables and a descent size parking lot. The food is very good. My kids like the car a asada tacos. I generally get a burrito which is very good. They have a hot red salsa which is more like a medium and a mild green one. My only complaint is that they charge for using a credit card.<//Review><pics>None< /pics><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

Visited this place twice and enjoyed the food both times! So far I've tried the Carne Asada and Al Pastor in Super Burrito form. The burritos are a good portion size and have everything you'd expect from a solid Mexican restaurant. What makes it stand out is how flavorful the meat is; I'd prefer that it were not so finely minced however. I would recommend the Al Pastor as the char on the pork adds nice texture.

Take cash as I believe they charge a small credit card processing fee. Don't let that stop you from some really great food!< /Text>

<Date>1555723410401</Date><Review>My wife and I eat at the food truck in the parking lot.

Really good Mexican food.  The pork is shredded but has a solid flavour.  Would like to highlight that the meat is not watery tasting like other places.  The beef is super cooked but still palatable.  We have tried taccs, super tacos, burritos, and tortas.

The food can be spicy or extra spicy - depending on what you would like.

They also have a restaurant next door that I have eaten at a number of times - similar taste.

It can be busy at times - normally lunch on week days is busy for the restaurant and the truck seems to be quite busy on Saturdays/Sundays around lunch.</Review>< GmapID>

Absolute best tacos anywhere. Taco truck outside is great if you just want a few tacos or a burrito to go. Sit inside for some chips with a mild/medium salsa if you have some time.

Lengua and carnitas are my go to proteins on my tacos with cheese added on top. Super tacos are too jam packed with sour cream, stick to the regular tacos and tell them to add cheese.< /text>

They are always cleaning with a mop or wiping down tables then jumping to delivering food to the table and grabbing refills all without washing their hands.. Kinda gross. Id probably rate the food truck they have off of Lawrence a lot better review but as for the restaurant I'd prefer any other Mexican restaurant.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Great taco place.all of my party loved the food. I want to go back.
Heck,they even have a taco challenge.
The record is 30 tacos.
I'm not going to try it. LOL.
The tacos tasted so good....
They need to have some real hot sauce.
Hotter than they serve. Not really a complaint.
Great tacos .< /review>

The staff were really nice and respectful but and me and husband loved the atmosphere. But unfortunately the quesadilla I was served was really greasy. The carne asada my husband had along with the rice and beans was very very dry. His meal look as though it was cooked a few hours ago and then heated up inside of a microwave. The best thing about the entire meal was the micheladas.<//Review>

The quality of the food used to be amazing;  now its just "meh". Might try the truck next time in hopes the food is better there... else it's time to find a new favorite taco spot.<//Text>< pictures>

This was my first time going here so I will have to see if the quality stays consistent enough for 5 Stars. I got a wet burrito and it was great! I went here at the busiest time during lunch and sat right down. I would recommend this place is you like Mexican food.</Review>

Wow!! This was my first time here. I know Mexican food, and this place is amazing. I ordered the tacos and rice and it was very authentic. It's been awhile since I had a meal like this in any restaurant. A friend suggested it and we went, I had no idea what to expect. If you have never been, you need to go. This will now be my go to spot from now on.<//text>

<text>This is a collection of two places. One sit down place and a truck parked next door. Both make the most amazing tacos. The city itself doesn't quite feel like bay area, but more like a city straight from Central CA. Dining here is more than about the food, it's about losing yourself in a place that's not quite Silicon Valley, inspite being so close.< /text><date>1536725230176<//date>< pics>

Everything was fresh and well executed. The hand made corn tortillas were awesome. Only complaint is that for non-meat eaters there are very few options. No fish options, no real vegetarian options. I opted for a shrimp dish, which turned out great.</Text>

I am giving this restaurant a 1 start because of the price not because of the quality of food. The food is really good the employees are really nice, but the price of the food is ridiculous and in top of that if you use you credit or debit card to pay for the food they charge you an additional fee to use your card. The food is good but the prices are ridiculous.  And if they give you chips make sure to ask if they are charging you for the chips. Mexican restaurants own by Mexican people are really expensive be careful where you go.</Text>

<Review>This is one of our favorite places to get tacos, real Mexican tacos not Tex-Mex tacos!

Their menu is very broad - they have caldos/broths, burritos, tortas, tostadas, chiles rellenos, platos de diferentes guisos/plates of different traditional prepared meals, etc.</Review><response>None<//response><Pics>None<//Pics></record></dataset><record>

<name>Mickey Mishra< /name><Time>1502770192844<//Time><Rating>4</Rating><Review>Okay I was actually really surprised they made me my custom order basically no issues at all yeah I was around like 10 or $11 but no big deal was kind of being a little more than I want to pay for breakfast but that's okay it's Oakland but the thing is that the breakfast really wasn't up to par to my standards but the taste of it was absolutely incredible yes the look wasn't great but the taste of the food was just to die for.  Another thing is if you haven't checked out their Salsas so far you definitely should check out their mild salsa their mild sauce is problem in the best mild salsa I have ever had and I'm not a big fan of mild salsa or the green stuff but this stuff is just absolutely incredible check them out there's a Target going to be built right next door so going stop on by.<//Review>< Pics>

<review>My friend and I both had burritos. His was a carnitas and mine was a chili verde. We both thought our burritos were nicely spiced and had a nice serving of meat. The menu was varied enough to appeal to a broad cross-section of people. The restaurant was clean and well taken care of. The decorations we're humble in style of a traditional Taqueria.<//review><user_id>105723834396263870747< /user_id></record>

I’m never coming back again to this place. I had a bad experience in the past but i wanted to give it another try hopping that this time I had a better experience. Again, the waitres did not even say good morning and her face look like if we weren’t welcome because we are Hispanic or I don’t know what problems this lady has. After she delivered the drinks, I was expecting her to ask us if we were ready to order but instead, she told us that they have rules and nobody can bring food from any other place. (I understand that) but it was a little bag of McDonald’s fries from my 4 year old little niece. Because she was hungry when she got out of school and I pass by McDonalds and got her that little bag of fries. Anyways we got up and leave the restaurant and the lady did not do anything to make us stay. They lost customers today and I don’t know how many you’ll continue to loose. (Owner,, train your people and avoid yourself legal issues in the future.) food is great!</Review>

No no no antes de ordenar me disen que van aserrar .... Y Vengo con mi familia . pero si tienen un loco borracho cantando en so villar con todo so tiempo del gusto . y no que ivan a serrar . me parese que la michacha joven que trabaja en la noche, ya tenia prisa .... Mendiga ambre .... Seria los cosineros o que seria ...

No no no before we ordered they tell me they are closing instead of welcoming us and I  came with my family. But there was a drunk guy playing 8 ball with all the time im thw world. I thought they were closing?! It seemed to me that the lady at night was in a hurry to close to get home instead of giving good customer service. Apart of that we took the order to go. As soon as we got home to eat we were missing 3 orders. We went back not so long after we left and no one was there. They were all gone.  We spent roughly around $100 for us to not have good service and fiod missing. Worst place to eat. I dont recommend this place at all!!!!!< /Review>

Fantastic service, friendly people, free chips and salsa (at the sit in restaurant, at least), and amazing food. There was even soccer on the TV when I went! Could not have been better.< /text>

Authentic but bland Mexican food. I got a chicken quesadilla and it was not very tasty, the chicken was dry, and the condiments we're spread all over the quesadilla (instead of in little cups). Not the worst quesadilla I've ever had, but honestly I've had better.</Text>

They only gave red salsa when I asked them extra salsas green and red. No pickled veggies. Burrito had no cilantro. One slice of lime and raffish were totally dried just like dried fruits.<//text>

Tacos, tacos, and tacos. That's all you need to know about taco de oro. They also have food trucks. One is located right next to it and one is at the homedepot by the great mall. TACOS.</text>

I know the place is called El taco de oro...but that doesn't mean they have to charge like it is gold!!! Meat was very dry and the tortillas were super salty.. I don't recommend anybody to come here unless you are made of Gold,and is willing to pay the price!!!< /text>

Not very good, but not terrible.  I think all the tech workers there don't know any better, hence the 4.4 star review.</review>

<Date>1379786201465< /Date><Rating>5< /Rating><Text>Open only from 11:30AM to ~2:15PM M-F.  Their trucks outside, and at ~Elco&Lawrence, do not make the very good Wet Burrito Carne Asada, and it is just "Not" the same as inside.  However, inside, The Wet Burrito, is worth walking there barefoot in Summer, to just taste it!  .  .
OMG!  So tasty good, with its Secret  bouquet of Chili Flavor and Zing!  Be sure to ask for Green Salsa too, and that Wet Burrito will do what it says ;-)
I pitty the poor people that do not tip 20% here.  That means bring $12 each with water only.  You will be so satisfied.  Take a second to go for a friend!  They will be so grateful!
Super gorgeous servers, and Cooks who can cook too!
I've never had a Margarita for Lunch in my life before, but I hear they are available.  Exotic bottled beers too.<//Text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Servicio malo!!! Me dijieron que iban a cerrar y tuve que llevar mi orden para la casa. Mi orden no estába correcta y 3 personas no agarraron su comida. No es lo que cuesta es la inconveniencia que causa. Por favor chequen su orden antes de llevar a su casa!!!</Text></record></dataset><record>
