Quick estimate with dame day appointment.  Reasonable prices for body work on my two cars. I am a repeat customer for the last eight years. So, I am biased in favor of the local, husband and wife owned business. They just do qauilty work for a fair price. Kind and friendly. They listen.</text>

< review>
David and Marie do great work with great prices.  They most recently repainted the hood and driver's mirror of my Cadillac SUV which had clearcoat failure--it now looks great.  In the past they also did an outstanding job painting my classic Chevrolet Malibu station wagon,  completely stripping the old paint, getting rid of the dings, and repainting it.  I get many compliments on this car and people regularly tell me they love the paint and ask where I got it painted.  Five stars all the way!</review>

< review>
Poor communication, owner ( Dave ) was extremely rude and will continually interrupt you. Additionally, he will not accept fault.... Only makes excuses for his bad behavior, and poor communication. Other owner ( Marie ) was nice enough but grossly failed to "Repair" this relationship as she put it. The sales manager ( Angel ) was rude and abrupt.... Not surprised though as the example had been set by Dave.They continually missed their own timelines, never bothered to call and inform me when things were talking longer. I had to be the one to call, as well as wasted my time with 3 series trips down to finish a 4k job that I had already paid in full for. Not a great experience at all.
See Yelp for a very detailed review.
Update:
I expected this very generic response and I got it. No worries. I'm filling a complaint with the BBB and BAR.< /review>

<review>I've gone here twice for repainting my 2008 Honda Civic (mostly because I didn't repaint the whole car the first time - probably should've!)

Marie is such a warm person - you can tell she genuinely cares!

They are the consummate professionals - they delivered really excellent and detailed work exactly on schedule.

I'm very satisfied - I resold my Honda Civic for a top price because the car looked GREAT!< /review>< date>

<text>The person I worked with was Brian Schaefer.  He was professional, courteous and bent over backwards to make the process go smoothly.  I picked up my 2004 F150 and it looked like new again.  They painted my hood, front bumper, top of cab, gas fill door, tailgate and rear bumper using the 3 stage process.  I could not be more pleased.  I recommend Maaco Sunnyvale to everyone who wants to be treated fairly, pay a reasonable price and receive quality work.

These guys are great. It's a good honest business with a great staff. My front bumper came off the front of my car while backing out of my driveway. I called a few other places and they said they would recommend just replacing it for nearly $1000. Marie took the time to have a discussion with me and made an effort to help me save money. I brought my car in and they took a look. It ended up needing a few replacement clips. We opted to order new brackets to make it more secure. Total cost was $50-100. My car is a 2004 and doesn't need picture perfect repair. Anyway, it was a real pleasure to do business with this office. The thoughtfulness and truly great customer service really made my day. In the future when I have bigger projects, I will happily come back because I feel like I can trust them to do the work at a fair price.</text>

Dave and Marie are friendly, patient, and efficient. They explain your options well and in depth, and enable you to make a decision you feel good with (there are always many options and choosing the best one is not always easy). I found their prices competitive and the work quality very satisfactory for the price.</review>

My wife got her Miata painted a different color. The paint looks great, you can’t tell it was originally black from the door jams or trunk. The body work is very good. Honestly much better than I was expecting. My wife is thrilled. I was kind of expecting something a bit budget looking, but this looks flawless. I strongly recommend them.

I got the base coat/ clear coat.

If you are thinking about it, I strongly suggest it. I only got the base / clear coat, so I can't comment on the quality of the cheaper options.< /review>

I’ve had this shop work on my cars for years. They always get the painting “spot on”. Because I worked on cars when I was a kid, I’m very particular about having a perfect job.They deliver! I trust them with my Porsche.<//Text>

< Review>
The lady owner their is extremely rude and has no customer skills. I was called informing me that my truck was complete and when I got their it did not look like the paint card I signed off. It was a poor paint job! . After the owner came out she was on the defense without even looking at my complaint. Than I asked her if anyone inspected the job prior to calling me.  She  made me feel like all she  wanted was my money and did not care if I was happy or not. The next day I had received a call from Brian my original rep sayin the sales rep he made me fell like he cared. . He is a good man. Thanks Brian for all your help. For the owner you might not want to encounter with customers as you need schooling on customer service. I am rating the star on the owners customer service. I would give Brian 5 stars for his customer service and professionalism.</Review>

<Text>The paint came out great but it took 3 extra days to get my car back, I was told on three separate occasions that my car will be ready tomorrow which meant three extra days of a car rental. I finally pick my car up only to find out when I got home that the job wasn’t complete, the window doesn’t work the door latch doesn’t work none of the switches work on the passenger side, and the outside door handle doesn’t light up anymore. I’m beginning to think that they ordered the wrong model door for my car because I was told that they were having electrical problems because the harness from the door didn’t match the mirror so they had to swap the harness out and use the old one. Needless to say I will be taking my car back today. But the customer service is always great, the people are very polite there.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures></record></dataset><record>

<text>Got my fender for my 05 Subaru Wrx and it looks absolutely amazing I am so impressed with their work. I literally went in Thursday for an estimate gave them the fender and boom they called me Friday letting me know it’s ready to pick up. I can not stress how much of a life saver these guys were if you have any body work, paint, or need to paint your entire car they are the way to go. It only cost me 275$ for the paint and clear coat and it included a lifetime warranty on the paint other body shops wouldn’t even do it all cause I didn’t want them to put it on and they were trying to charge me 1000$ and they use water based paint! Do not get your car done somewhere that uses water base. Macco uses urethane which adheres better and lasts much longer.<//text><pics>None<//pics>< Rate>

<review>I took my car here to replace some parts lost after a minor accident, and to repair a badly dented bumper. They did a beautiful job. No sign of a dent now. The cost was very reasonable and   the owners are very friendly and easy to work with. I am so glad l chose this company!< /review>< Pictures>

<review>Look very closely at the results of their work.
Otherwise later on they'll tell you 'You signed off on this, should have said something, buddy. '

This is that case when cheap is way too expensive.
Couldn't sell my BMW to Beepi  because of their paint work on a minor scratch', how stupid is that.
And it does look bad, certainly should have had a better look.

They are nice people,
but never again.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

After putting a two-foot long scrape on the rear door of my wife's car I really wasn't looking forward to an $800 to $1,000 repair bill.  A friend recommended MAACO in Sunnyvale and showed me the work they just completed on his truck.  I got an estimate of $400 and was very happy.  I asked if when they had the door panel off if they could fix the "childproof lock" that was broken. They called and said the mechanism had to be replaced at a cost of about $50 with overnight shipping.  (The Honda dealer wanted $250 to fix it!)  I can't recommend this place enough for quality, customer service, and value.< /review>

I am working on restoring a pickup and one of the first steps was to get some dents pulled so I can dynamat the interior of the door (I am trying to make the truck really quiet inside). I took it to Macco and not only did they give me a frankly fantastic price, they painted it to match the old colors instead of the single color I paid for. Needless to say I am extremely happy with this.
I intend to change the color of the truck later on but I am not sure what color I am going to do so I only asked that they make it weather proof for a few months (ie. not plain primmer) and they went and did a perfect match!
Also, they did a great job getting the dent out, now the door looks fantastically smooth!</Text>

Great paint job.but quality of work poor some cosmetics still there.thats why im so dissapointed.when the time for pick up my car.im paying for adding damages. Thats why it will cost over a thousand dollars for painting.and the target date of pick up are not follow .Think about it if you are not a sensitive person its ok to use the Maaco auto body shop in sunnydale ca.<//text>

<review>Fabulous wines, fabulous owners, and fabulous prices!

We spent about 3 hours here while trying out about 20 wines.  The two owners, Gary Grant and Sue, are great to talk to, plus a lot of the 30 or so of us -- at times -- who were customers were also gregarious.  The vintner intends to try to make a wine from every grape on a chart of all of them -- see the attached pix for the little X's indicating how many he's already made!

We will certainly be back!< /review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN9zcgjAQs-FY2GVrHGKO-ISS1xBsIog4nypqqf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNXMl1DfFB15g2A30TninHR9qoRJN2o0L9RXXa8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMAycCeLrVWuJcTN15ncRLSkTsdJyhnf7c39kQF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO9l5wG2VgbPX1XKD760FrGVZ7OWufc4AZBWelM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPPWAKfxH5mQ-vXP3nu0yOnSC8py1oLjFuGmOba=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM-c_fzdUsVS4ELzBPPiZiTXECGTMu5E8UYH6Si=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><response>{'time': 1580266345667, 'text': "Hi L M, thank you so much for the kind words and photos.

Definitely my new favorite wine tasting spot in Murphys! Gary and Sue are so nice, funny, and just fun to hangout with. They don't rush you at all and make you feel right at home. Plus the wines were great! There wasn't a single one I didn't like. Before you leave they'll take a Polaroid of you and your friends to add to their photo wall <3< /text>

<Text>The best wine tasting in Murphys by far. Everywhere else does the standard "$10 tasting for ~5 wines, tasting fee waived if you buy a bottle". Gossamer is different. Wine tastings are only $5, and there's like... 50 wines. Sue (the "Cellar Rat") suggested we go slow, and I laughed. By the end of the tasting we were swapping stories with her sweet old mother from Arkansas who was pushing like 94 years old. The interior is cute with Polaroids all over the wall. Definitely go!<//Text>< name>

The winemaker and his wife were the pourers when we visited and made us feel welcome despite the large crowd they were hosting. Their wines are unique and delicious and they're generous with the tastings! It's a must if you're in the Murphy's area!</Review>

Very friendly service. We really liked that you could try as many of the wines as you wanted. More unusual Italian, Spanish, Portuguese varietals, the wines were quite delicious. We really liked the Torrontes and Nebbiolo. Prices are reasonable - bottles are in the $20-30 range. 15% discount if you buy half a case (6).< /Review>

<Review>There is so much about this place that you just can't find anywhere else. The wines are superb (and only $5 tastings!) - the atmosphere is fun and friendly and never pretentious - the owners, Gary & Sue are amazing people that truly love sharing their wines with everyone. This place feels like home as soon as you walk in the door. And they're honestly my favorite wines in the whole town!</Review>< GmapID>

Highly recommend coming in here. Winemaker and his wife are usually the ones pouring who are super nice and fun to talk to. Their wines are different than the other ones in murphys but still are great in flavor. New place but put a lot of passion into their wine and it definitely pays off. Worth adding into your usual winery stops one weekend.<//Review>

Great winery with fantastic service. Homie and very friendly. Great wine choices with lots of different selections. My personal top two were the nebbiolo 2013 and the rascal. Sue was very informative and very sweet. We had a great experience! Will come back next time we're in town!< /review>

The ambiance in Gossamer Cellars was laidback and the people who own it were very welcoming. I would recommend this place to anyone visiting Murphys who wants a fun and inexpensive wine tasting experience. Also, GREAT wine!<//review>

<Review>Very pleasant and blissful temple in Bay Area. More of South Indian (Telugu) culture. Satyanarayana swami vratham is done every fortnight and anybody can donate $75 and book a slot.< /Review><date>1572986913234< /date><Gmap_id>0x808fcc7793381c75:0xd02f61c6fd04e408< /Gmap_id><rate>5<//rate><Resp>None</Resp>< userid>

<Text>The temple is good but be aware of the priests. The priests are very rude, unfriendly, highly commercial. They treat you low if you dont know them or if you are not a rich sponsor. This is the main barrier for the spirituality here. Specially North Indian folks please don’t join for your pujas here as they wont encourage you with some age old orthodox stuff as a reason. Its well funded temple but very sad to see that ambience.  So I recommend you to just have darshan here but don’t interact with priests in any manner. Else it will make you feel disappointed. I will try bringing this issue to their board members.</Text>< pics>

Nice temple in nice environment.  Though its a temple, they do provide catering service for Indian functions like house warming or birthday parties. Overall nice experience.<//Review>

Nice temple. Many Hindu Gods in one place like the other Bay area temples. Saraswathi here is extra special, she is so beautiful. Perumal and padmavathy are the center of attraction.</review>

They perform Satyanarayana Pooja very well. But only issue is punctuality, a delay of 30 mins expected for major events.</Text>

Nice Temple. Pooja vidhi will be so good. If you have any ritual that needs to be done you can go here. The Poojaris here perform the rituals exactly the way they have to be performed. I love this place. Feels like I am at my Home temple back in India.<//review>

Doing Excellent Service to Telugu community. Still, some  areas to improve. Also, please try to offer services  at quite reasonable rates  those who require Pooja services for functions  ie.,Barasala, Griha Pravesam, Aksharabhayasam and etc. In devotees' houses<//Review>

<Text>I came here 3 times already. last night which I attended a pharmaceutical company hosted dinner and service and food was amazing as always. I wish I had taken more pictures of the yummy food they served us but I couldn't . I've tried their salmon, pasta and steak and all of them were amazing. We had 3 different fries with different flavors and 2 different salad served first then the main course and they dessert. Food, quality and service is beyond amazing. The server was super nice who also recognized me even though I had been there twice prior to last night. He also provided one of my colleagues a vegan dish since they had no vegan dish on the menu for last night's event. It meant so much to us. Thank you so much!!!<//Text><UserId.>104578517069335612103< /UserId.>< Date>

One of the best steaks I've ever had, accompanied by top notch, friendly service. This isn't one of those stuffy steak houses - this is a place you can go for decadence, satiation of the senses and style, while wearing jeans and sneakers. The mussels (special starter) were mindblowing - I've never had mussels cooked so well.</review>

<Text>4.5 stars for this SF favorite.. I tried their Kobe beef rib eye and I would say it ranks 2nd against my favorite south of SF.. I would recommend this place to anyone who appreciates how a steak is supposed to be prepped!.. not dipped in butter or over seasoned.. its just right!< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

They are good but too expensive.
You can buy four ears of corn for what they sell the small cup of corn.< /review>

Beautiful decor!! Lots and lots of desserts to pick from you'll be surprised. Great music in the ambience. Love that they can make substitutions on any order. And everything is made fresh. I orders the 3 churros with ice cream and they were warm and soft. Not stale or over cooked like other places. 😍😍 lovely place to take my kids as a rewards when they behave. And I loved my caramel frap 😍<//Review>

They take their sweet time. It had taken them over 10 minutes just to prepare some fruit and a raspado. To top it off they told me that they ran out of the raspado I wanted and asked if i wanted to change. Basically wasting time. I’d rather recommend Patty’s Ice Cream shop.< /review>

It's cute inside, but the last two times I went the service is horrible.  I left the first time because they were awful at managing multiple people.  They don't seem to have a system.  The second time, they didn't have two of the things I wanted and the girl was really bad at communicating, so I left for the second and final time with nothing but a bad taste in my mouth of poor service.<//text>

Ordered a banana split without peanuts, after getting it the first time there was peanuts, we take it back and ask for another. When we recieved the second one there was NO BANANA ?? That's the equivalent to ordering a cheeseburger and it doesn't have cheese on it, I don't even have to explain how stupid that is .</Review>

Cool place like the store front set up, but it took 25 minutes to make our raspdos. I had a raspado de vainilla and it taste like orchata, not the best in regards to authenticity... I guess ill try a diferent flavor next time.< /text>

Unable to leave ZERO rating! 55 min wait for raspado and an employee's attitude is more concerned with closing than serving your paid order.< /Text>

<review>Went for ice cream with my kiddos. There where a few people ahead. My sons been having trouble with pain in his abdomen and bowl movements so we asked for the restroom. The girl behind the counter would not open the door until we ordered and pain. My son was crying in pain and i begged the clerk to let him go. She said it was not her problem and that she would get in trouble.  After the "not my problem" i was not nice. I will not be going back that was definitely not the service i was expecting. I hope the owners reevaluate this.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Expanded location and extended hours make this establishment a hot spot for locals and a must try for everyone. With delectable creations that mimic surreal works of art, you'll be visually enticed to what your order turns out like post-preparation.< /Review>

Good flavor! Too slow service. 20-30 minutes to get your food. No difference if you call ahead, they start preparing your food when yuou gety there and pay...</Text>

<Review>Fantastic job repairing my original furnace here in Vintage Hills, Temecula. On time, found defective part, found part bad 'holding' the perished part. Had to do a bit of pipe work to get to the bad part; had to track down aftermarket part. Everything works; everyone super nice on phone and Evan doing the work. Price was reasonable for amount of work done, new parts. Highly recommended.< /Review>< user_name>

Great company....A+ experience!!!

We just bought a home with lots of odd and end plumbing work that needed to be done ASAP. On a Monday, Jerry the owner came by to check out the issues and did not oversell or make us feel pressured in any way!! We were informed, educated and he kept it 100% real & honest....just 2 days later we had Jon come out take care of business!!. He took his time, did great work and was super personable. All of our issues were fixed quickly and cleanly. There is no doubt we will be using Liberty again down the line.  Overall, we had a great experience with Liberty and would recommend to anyone and everyone!</Review>

<rating>5</rating><review>I already knew I needed a new garbage disposal and two new toilets, so naturally I called Liberty for these jobs as I've used them in the past for major work like heat/air and ducting. I know that their pricing is always fair (I do my research), and everyone who's ever come out is very professional and kind. Steve and Jose did all the plumbing installs. I never thought I'd be excited about new toilets in my home, and I couldn't be happier! :D
As long as I live in the area, I know I'll only be calling Liberty for any future repairs or new installs.
Thank you!</review><pics>None</pics>< response>

<text>Liberty kept in constant contact with us before, during, and after the pipe repair and water heater replacement.  John is incredibly professional and skilled at his job.  Great install John!  He answered all of my questions and was completely transparent about pricing.  I’m very happy with how quickly they were able to help us as well as the quality of their work.  Would recommend to anyone and everyone.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<review>The drain pipe under our house was leaking. We called Liberty and they were able to replace the rusted out cast iron pipe quickly, for a very fair price. They communicated throughout the process, updating us on what was happening and asking questions, when needed.

They showed up when promised, began the work right away and made sure to inspect the pipes for leaks before they left.

They exceeded my expectations and I will highly recommend them to anyone I know who needs plumbing work. Great job, Liberty!<//review>< Pics>

<Review>Jerry and David were on time and went right to work. They were very informative and knowledgeable while showing me everything they did to inspect our furnace, filters and air conditioner unit for preventative maintenance. They were professional, clean and courteous. Never once did they try to up-sale me products, and they've got a great value on their yearly maintenance program. I highly recommend Liberty for all your air conditioning and heating needs!</Review>< pictures>

<time>1599862634171< /time><Rate>5< /Rate><text>David & Jerry were awesome!!! 😁 I originally called another company because my AC went bad (they were the same company I used only a year earlier). Long story short, the other company gave me a high price to fix a bad circuit board & wouldn’t fix the issue for 2 weeks because they couldn’t get the part & charged me just to show up. Fed up I called around & someone referred me to Liberty. They were the complete opposite: no fee just to show up & diagnose the issue, honest, fast, & very courteous. David also checked some of the issues the other repairman told me I needed fixed, like replacing my AC unit. He found there was nothing wrong with it (honest). He agreed the issue was the circuit board as well. David & Larry came back with the part in only 2 hours, fixed the issue in 20mins, and for $200 less than the other company 🙂 I was so satisfied, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEM! And I will use them if any other issues come up for sure.</text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

Liberty Plumbing Heating and Air Conditioning was recommended by family members and after our great experiences, we recommend them to everyone too. They have been caring, responsive, honest and thorough. We first called for help diagnosing an issue with our A/C. In the middle of summer, they were at our house the next day. This is a family owned business with a lot of heart. I think I interrupted dinner one night when calling about our broken garbage disposal; I was expecting to leave a message but Deanna was happy to talk me through whether we were dealing with an emergency or not. When Jerry and his assistant arrived and confirmed the disposal needed to be replaced, they took time to let my 10 year old son "help" them. I told them he thought he could install it himself after watching some particularly empowering YouTube videos. Needless to say, I'm so glad the unit was installed professionally. The kindness shown toward my family warmed my heart and we're grateful to have Liberty to call when we need them.< /review>

<Text>David has been awesome!  The quote I got from another company to replace the bad unit was HUGE.  While the price is still large, it was at least within reason with Liberty and quality was perfect from the factory.  Installation was efficient but spent enough time to make sure it was done correctly.  It was NOT rushed.  Office staff I have spoken to have been very friendly and helpful although things are running flawlessly.

I absolutely would recommend Liberty for work...<//Text><gmapID>0x80db7e779e39ca29:0x25917bdbbaff2466</gmapID>< time>

Have had numerous plumbing issues since purchased current home a few years ago.  Had  tried a couple different plumbing companies.   Since I’ve tried Liberty 2 years ago I do not call anybody else.
No need to as they are the whole package.   They get me scheduled promptly, confirm day before appointment, service tech calls when on his way with arrival time estimate.  Is friendly & respectful & give helpful advice. & price up front.  Cleans up after the job is completed & asks if any questions or if I have anything else that I want him to look at while he’s here.   Prices seems fair for work being done.
So pleased to know I have Liberty as my go to A/C, heating & plumbing company.   I have used for all 3 services & won’t  use anyone else< /Review>

They fixed our AC unite! It quit working a few days ago and with how hot 🥵 it has been, others places were booked up with appointments but Jerry was able to get me a appointment the very next morning. Devon showed up on time fixed the part that was broken and couldn’t of been nicer. Best of all it was done with a very reasonable price. Thanks 😊 so much Liberty.</review>

<review>We hired Liberty to come out yesterday afternoon and they were able to show up first thing this morning! Our service tech, David, was right on time and very pleasant, clean and thorough. He had to crawl up into our attic through a very narrow passage in the rafters to access the area of concern. He investigated,  took pictures, came down and gave us the good news that everything we fine and no further work there was required! We had a second issue that I asked him to look at. He isolated and fixed that issue in less than an hour.  We were very happy with his service and would recommend them to our family and friends. We will definitely use them in the future!< /review>< Date>

<review>i would just like to say a extremely huge thank you to jose and jerry the owner as well,  there are not enough positive words that i can put in writing about jose.  Jose worked very hard all day on both my furnace as well as my shower. it is very hard to find young men like jose who work as hard as him, there was nothing that stoped him from trying to figure out what was wrong, he was very nice, kind, respectful, professional, fun, personable, humble, very hard working and also very friendly. If there was something that was in question and he needed more information he would call jerry the owner and ask him.  He never guessed at anything, it always had to be done both the right way and the correct way.  I am very impressed with him. People like jose are very hard to come by these days, he works very very hard as well. the  quality of his work performance is  very important to him as well. Jose was also very reliable, responsible, dependable, trust worthy.  He called to let us know that he was on his way also.  I greatly appreciate people like jose. I have never had a service tech come out to my house and work so hard.  He multi tasked working on 3 different things in my house, he also did an exceptional job installing my new shower head. As i said i cannot say enough positive and great  things about jose.  The man is a rock star.  I honestly
truly and greatly appreciate him alot. A million thank yous to jose and jerry the owner of LIBERTY PLUMBING. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU LIBERTY PLUMBING FOR SENDING JOSE TO MY HOUSE, I AM TRULY GRATEFUL, THANKFUL AND APPRECIATIVE FOR THE QUALITY OF WORK THAT JOSE DID. SINCERLY A LOYAL CUSTOMER OF LIBERTY PLUMBING, IF YOU NEED A GREAT COMPANY TO USE, THIS IS IT, CALL DEANNA OR HIS WIFE CHRIS AND SCHEDULE AND APPOINTMENT.

Most current job - Move washer/dryer from the garage to inside home. Job entailed demolishing shelves in storage room. Reroute all plumbing from garage to storage room. Steve, initially came over to give me a quote for the job, but decided he could complete the job that same day. Steve gave a great quote, estimated time frame of completion, and removed demo trash. All goals met and work complete to satisfaction.

< Review>
I am so glad that I used liberty plumbing who took care of myriad issues that I had with a new home.

First off the office was courteous and professional in setting up the jobs.  The team was phenomenal.  They were punctual and also very professional and friendly.  A shout out to Steve who was absolutely great.

Now for the different jobs...

1.  I highly recommend getting the water purification system they recommended, the Halo 5.  My drinking water is completely different and tastes great.  Washing up feels so clean!  They also did a great install and made all the connections and drainage seamlessly.  The owner, Jerry, went over the options before buying this and he saved me from buy additional under sink purifiers that turn out to be unnecessary and this save me money.  Other companies were selling me much more expensive systems and additional under sink systems with additional connections to my appliances.  It would have been so complicated!

2.  My furnace and air conditioning setups were not to code and in fact the mounting of the furnace was a complete disaster.   They fixed the mount from a mess of 2x4s which were nailed all over the place to support the system.  Now it is properly suspended and earthquake rated.  They  also discovered that several connections were configured properly for the best airflow and functioning of the system. It was a difficult under the house job and they got it done.

3:  And I have to mention my connection to the city sewer line... or lack of a connection!  They were able to get to fix a disconnection that was almost 6 feet underground with what seemed like an impossibly small hole for the team to get down to and fix.. thanks Dave, how did you get in there??? All done and patched in one day... and the concrete job was better than what seemed like a spot where previous work was done.

They are coming back to address a few more issues, but I couldn’t wait to write a review.

Overall a professional courteous team that does a great job and when they are finished the place is cleaned up and in tip top shape.  The owner pay close attention to the jobs and checked in on the work several times through to ensure the best work was done.  They also found ways to save money with maintenance plans.. the jobs were so big that the discounts from having a plan will pay for itself for years.

I am so pleased that my AC and furnace won’t fall off in an earthquake and have the right connections; the water I am drinking is now healthy and pure... and my sewer actually drains to they city sewer system instead of under the road!

Anything you need, they will take care of you.</Review>

This is the second time, in two different homes; that I had to call upon Liberty Plumbing. The staff are very Professional and considerate. They are prompt and thoroughly explain the issue, once they identify it. The pricing is fair and reasonable. I would recommend this company and Dave, the Technician, to anyone.

UPDATE - On 01/10/2020 I had to call on Liberty, again, to replace a leaking Water Heater. Once again, they responded quickly. Steve, the Technician was both Professional and Friendly. And the price was cost effective.

Again, I would refer Liberty to anyone needing an excellent Plumber, HVAC, or Heating Technician.< /Text>

Steve did a great job fixing my water problem. Deanna was very helpful getting my appointment scheduled and sending Steve out. I highly recommend Liberty for their great customer service and a job well done!

Update: I had to have Liberty out again to correct an issue with the previously installed pressure valve.  It was making a high pitch sound.  Justin came out to fix it and did a fantastic job. It's the reason I go with Liberty.  They honor their work and have extremely knowledgeable and professional staff.

Justin also found a problem we had with the hot water pressure. There was a block in the water line to the water heater. He fixed it all up for us. The noise is gone and the water pressure is amazing. Thank you again Justin for coming out late to fix our issues and for your great work. We will absolutely use Liberty again!</review>

Just to let you know, I've never been so pleased with a Plumbing company as Liberty Plumbing.  Justin the repairman was so prompt, (right on time), efficient and knew his job.  Right from the start, he went straight to the job, took care of everything, was clean, neat and very polite.  I would recommend their company, prices and staff, I give you guys 5 stars.
Much thanks and when I have plumbing needs they will be the first ones I call.

I also appreciate Angie's from directing them to me.  Much thanks.
Sincerely,
Ms Jo L Ray< /review>

They were able to come out within 24 hours, and arrived in the time window promised.  David did an excellent job of diagnosing the issue with my AC leaking water in the garage.  He showed me pictures and offered me repair options.  He then fixed it right away and even improved the plumbing and resealed the unit. Their price was very fair.  I've been their customer for over five years and have not had a bad experience.  All their technicians have been courteous, honest, and we'll trained.</review>

Been a a customer for 20 years. Great service, even in emergencies. The plumbers are very knowledgeable and proficient. My first water heater replacement was done by the company owner and Craig(who, from my understanding still works there); this unit was put in by Gonzalo who has done other plumbing at my home, and is always curteous and professional.<//review>

everything went right.  the gal who answered the phone in the office.  the ease by which we made the appt.  her patience in explaining pricing, etc.

two techs came out on the right day at the right time.  they took time to explain what they were going to do and how much it was going to cost.  i took advantage of a package that included a return later in the year to check out my air conditioning and perform a maintenance.  they then did exactly what they said they would do......in booties!< /Review>

We originally had called another AC repair company and they never called back. The we called Liberty.
Steve came out and serviced our AC unit on a very hot day.  He was very efficient in diagnosing and fixing the problem.  He also checked our coolant level and  compressor as part of his visit.
We are very happy with the service and would call Liberty again if we need AC/furnace repaired.
We would recommend Liberty Plumbing and heating.  We should have called them to begin with!!!< /text>

I dealt with this company 8 mos ago and here I am again, called them to service my 15 yr old air conditioner and once again they did a great job.

Below is my previous experience with them.

I highly recommend this place,  my air conditioner stop working on Labor Day, I called them for service and was told that they could send a service person that day, but because it was a holiday there would be a charge of $200.00 however, if I was able to wait until the next day, I could have a service person arrive at 10 am, without a service charge. I agreed to wait since on Labor Day  I had had another company come and check the air condition and had said that I needed a new motor it would cost $900.00 which I turned  down.
The service man from Liberty arrived the next day promptly at 10 am and after checking the air conditioner motor he said that I needed a new capacitor, he said this was common, the price $235.00 I asked if the service was guaranteed and he said, yes for 1 yr
So I gave him the ok to do the work and within 30 min my air conditioner was working as good as before.</review>

David was especially efficient.  My heating and air conditioning system had not been serviced for a long time and he was very thorough.  He even had to make a special trip to get a HEPA filter that is not in high demand.  In fact the parts house  only had   one in stock.  He explained everything he found in detail so I could understand exactly what needed to be done.  The final invoice was exactly what he quoted.  In addition to his technical skills he was extremely pleasant to deal with.  The five stars are truly deserved.

Two weeks after the service on my HVAC equipment my water heater started leaking from the bottom and had to be replaced.  This time Steve came to my rescue.  He was every bit as helpful and efficient as David had been.  My water heater is behind a pegboard wall in the garage and Steve removed it and moved other items that were in the way.  And he did all this without any complaining or "sighing", even though he had every right to do so.  Steve was truly a joy to deal with.  This company deserves five stars across the board.< /review>

Saturday morning we were awakened by a drip-drip-drip from the ceiling, which turned out to be a pinhole leak in a cold water line in our attic. The timing could not have been worse, as we were hosting a party that afternoon at 4!

Deanna was super responsive, and at 11 committed to have a tech do the work in time for the party. When I hadn't heard by 1:30, I checked in. Her tech had run into problems with the job he was currently working on. She and Justin (and the other client) teamed up to suspend the other job for a few hours to get our leak fixed.

Justin arrived at 2:40 and did a thorough and professional job. He had to crawl hands-and-knees through our hot attic, but he had it fixed and tested before our first guests arrived. He even offered the Angie's List discount unprompted!

Liberty Plumbing saved our party!<//Text>

Thank you for the professional, courteous, and quick response to repair my a/c unit! I contacted Liberty from the recommendation of my friend and co-worker, and I'm so glad I did! From the office staff to David, the technician, I received great service and he was able to fix my a/c on the same day! Thank you!< /text>

David and Sarge performed an excellent installation of our new heating and air conditioning system . They were very professional and they frequently asked for our preferences so we had input on how and where various components were installed. From Jerry(the owner) to the office staff and technicians , every one was courteous and helpful.<//Review>

We are very pleased with the service we received on our air conditioning unit.  They came out very promptly and on time.  They were very efficient at identifying and fixing a problem that no one else could find.  They explained the problems very well and what work was needed.  They made sure everything was clean afterwards and that the unit was functioning probably.  So happy I called them.< /review>

<review>Honest company with good morals and values. They installed our new AC unit and furnace. The owner of the company met us in person and gave us an amazing deal. They are very military friendly (Veteran owned and operated) and caring. They even paid for a temporary portable  AC unit for us to use while we waited for them to come and install.
We were under contract at first with Costco but their company had Us sign paperwork that was against Costco policy so we got out of that one but we are so grateful we found this company.  The cost of everything that was done was half the cost of Costco and works amazingly.
I would recommend this company to everyone and anyone I know because it’s really hard to find honest companies nowadays. The owner even came a week after install to make sure everything was done properly. You just don’t see that nowadays.
Thank you !

<rate>5<//rate><Text>To make a long story short, I had a very complicated heat pump issue.  Old units (+15 year), no access, home warranty company jacking me around and an unknown rodent issue.  I had three contractors check out this situation.  Liberty is the "thinking" HVAC service company.  They made the others I spoke with look like complete drones.  In short, yes I still have a long term problem.  Heat Pumps like all pieces of equipment wear out and need to be replaced.  I am fortunate to have enough money to fix this problem along with many others in the 1986 wine country house I live in.  It is difficult to find good contractors and nearly impossible to find great ones.  I work with them all the time with a property like this.  Do not hesitate to give Jerry a call at Liberty.  This is my GO-TO when it comes to HVAC moving forward.  They will get a call back in the next couple of years when these old units get torn out.  This is how a business is built and a reputation is developed.  Nice work guys!!< /Text>< pics>

We are sorry you feel he didn't do anything but if you should have any further questions, please feel free to call the office.  Have a great week.  Jerry & Kristin"}<//resp>

<text>Hi

Cade Davis,  your master air condition service provider, initially provided a quote and then when agreed.  We decided to have the work completed he installed a new compressor in our existing Air conditioner. He completed the work  in one day and had the system up and running. Lets hope the system will provide us a carefree cool summer.

Thanks a million,

I hired Liberty Plumbing to flush my tankless water heater and fix the attaching plumbing. The plumber was on time, very knowledgeable, and did a great job for a fair price. He could have done a better job cleaning up and repairing wall marks.< /review>

<Text>Called Liberty concerning a suspected hot water slab leak in my kitchen & a team arrived ahead of schedule the next morning.  Both Kade & Sargon were professional, courteous & hard-working throughout the discovery, diagnosis & repair phases.  Kade was thoughtful & methodical is his approach & successfully determined the source of the leak, then provided me with several repair options & estimated costs.  They worked straight through the day & into the evening to complete the reroute through the attic using pex piping/new copper fittings, & water service was fully restored before they left.  I appreciated their neatness in wearing gloves & boot covers, laying down mats & tarps, & cleaning up at the end of the project.  Kade was both informative & knowledgeable, answering all my questions.  I was very pleased with the outcome & would highly recommend them for any plumbing needs.  The 10% military discount was appreciated as well!< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< userid>

Liberty is an honest company to do business with! My air conditioning quit working on one of the hottest days this summer. Kade was very professional and knowledgable, he replaced a part in my AC and installed a Wi Fi thermostat. I am a satisfied customer and recommend to friends and family.</review>

<Review>Good honest people!  Great prices and stay true to their quotes! My mom had 2 other plumbers go out to her house and convinced her that she needed a new Water heater. My sister told me to try Liberty Before doing anything and Jerry, the owner, came out and said she just needed a $125 part. A week later Jerry called and said the employee that had my moms part had quit and took the part with him. 2 days later Jerry showed up and did the install free of charge! Needless to say, my whole family has used them ever since!  Hard to find honest hardworking people that won't try to upsell you these days but Liberty is "those" people!<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

I called Liberty plumbing on Monday morning because of a clogged drain leading from the kitchen sink to the main sewer line and Jerry said he would try to get someone out by afternoon.  This clogging has been a constant problem for the 20 years we have lived at this home and I was always able to clear it myself using a drain snake.  This time I could not get the drain clear.  Steve and his helper arrived at 11:30 Monday morning and using a combination of an electric powered snake and a gas powered water pressure hose they were able to clear the blockage.  I could not believe the junk that came out before they cleared the blockage.  It appeared to be white chunks of chalk or joint compound that may have been in that drain from the time of construction causing the many times I needed to snake out the line.

The service charge was exactly what was quoted.  I would highly recommend Liberty Plumbing.  .</Text>

I would highly recommend this office for all of your bankruptcy needs! Louis is very professional and courteous. He did a great job of walking us through and explaining everything. The first lady I dealt with to help gather all my info and complete paperwork wasn’t great, but as soon as I brought my concern to Mr. Lyons he promptly put me with Sylvia who was AMAZING! I just love it when someone is thorough and knows their job well! Thank you Louis and Sylvia for making a stressful experience such a breeze!<//review>

I am very pleased with their professionalism and hospitality. From the time you walk in, you know your in the right place because their staff is so friendly! This was my second time coming to Scott Lyons Attorney and outcome was quick and much needed relief with my situation. My family and I have always recommended them to friends and family and they also have come to Scott Lyons! I’m so grateful for everything they did for me! I highly recommend Scott and Louis Lyons Attorney!
Thank you,

Looking to retain lawyer for rights to see my son. Had consultation with Mr. Lyons and he was great! I was excited to have him represent me in my case. However I am living out of state (10 hours away) and had a day planned on Sunday to be in town to visit son. Unfortunately the staff could not meet with me for even 30 minutes to have me sign contract and me pay them!!! Crazy to think you have to beg to pay an attorney but staff couldn’t make time to take my money. Mr. Lyons seemed great however his staff could be his shortfall.< /Review>

The staff is great! I went in there not knowing what to do, defeated by life. They made my bankruptcy experience easy. Sylvia was very helpful and informative. Mr. Lyons is also very pleasant and professional.
Highly recommend!!!<//Text>

One of the best lawyers in Visalia California. In my case I was going against a tough family that has connections with the bar association in town. But even like that my lawyer Scott Lyons was able to stop my case before going to federal court and with the outcome at my favor. plus this law firm has a well organized and friendly staff I highly recommend this lawyer who may be in need of one!</Text>

Attorney at Law Scott Lyons and his Staff are very professional and pleasant. They all communicate well and kept me informed. Mr. Lyons finalized my case for me and he did an awesome job of representation on my behalf.  And the icing on the cake is that his fee was reasonable and affordable.  Thank you Mr. Lyons for a job well done.<//Text>

<UserId.>101375340267381550985<//UserId.><Text>We have been involved with this office for the last 8 months. We just wanted to say that most of our interactions have been with Sylvia who has been a true professional. We have been in and out of the office and we can see how great of a job she does at multi-tasking. However, she has always responded to our questions as promptly as she can. Sylvia is always respectful and polite. Whenever we had questions or needed an update she does it with intelligence and patience; ensuring we understood what the current status is and what might come up.
We have been in and visited many offices dealing with support staff personnel. Sylvia is one of the great ones. She takes pride in her work and is obviously dedicated and cares. We wish there was one of her in every office we have to deal with. We hope she is paid at the top of the scale for her position, because she would be a definite asset for any business.</Text>< pics>

I for unseen circumstance needed the  assistance of Attorney Scott Lyons Law office.  The minute that I walked into the attorney office and met Sylvia Gutierrez I know that I was in good hands and had picked the right office to handle my case. Sylvia has always been super informative I have called her and emailed her for so many question, big or small.  During my case and even after. And Sylvia has always had an answer for me and has kept me on track with appointments and court dates, even texting me directions at the last minute.  I know that if it would not have been for Sylvia I would have been so lost and unsure of the case during this time.  Thank you Sylvia for always being polite and ready to answer questions for me.</review>

I would recommend Attorney Scott Lyons and or Louis Lyons services to anyone in need of an attorney. In fact, I’ve recommended this office to multiple of my friends and acquaintances.
If in the future I’m in the need of an attorney I would defiantly seek help from Attorney Scott and Louis Lyons.< /text>< pics>

Scott Lyons and his office were quite the godsend after dealing with many attorneys in the Tulare county area. His staff was attentive, his advise was not only free but cut right to the point, and he did not pressure me into using his services but I'm glad I did. I will be referring all my friends and family to this office in the future, and recommend the same to other Google users.</review>

<review>Great experience here. Called and made an appointment at 3:30 for 5pm. Easy and convenient. I even received a text confirmation afterwards.  First time getting my Mani/Pedi done since March and I felt very comfortable. Great gel manicure and great pedicure. Thankful this is so close to my home and so professional. Everyone is in masks and there is plastic hanging around you. Didn't get either of my my technicians names but I'm really happy with every aspect of my visit. I will definitely be coming back.</review>< user_id>

I used to be a regular at this establishment, and honestly, it’s really sad to see what they have turned into. I know the pandemic has affected this business, however, it’s vicious, non-professional, and most importantly ILLEGAL to GOUGE their prices.
I used to pay for my full set $43 give or take. Recently I called to get a quote on a regular dipping powder or acrylic set with extensions, I was bringing the specific color I wanted. The girl on the phone (Katty) said that it was $52 and since I was bringing my nail polish, there was no extra charge. Once I got there, the price changed and I ended up paying $55 plus $7 just for the application of the nail polish I brought from home, and if I wanted my nails to be cleaned up it was going to be more.
Again, this business is not openly sharing their price rate and charging tremendously amount of money. This is illegal and I would not recommend to use this establishment.</Text>

Visiting the area, first time here   I was with a friend that was taking her daughter to a dance class in the strip mall.  Though they were busy I was able to get in with a 10 min wait and got a nice pedicure and manicure at a great price< /text>

Best nail spa in the valley. I give them 10 stars.  I'm so glad this establishment survived the pandemic. Besides having  the best nail technicians in the Valley, they are also very clean, and professional with  fair and competitive prices. All around a fantastic nail salon.<//text>

We shopped here yesterday.  It’s just a really great thrift store.  There are so many interesting things and the prices are reasonable.  They have two buildings.  The main building has clothes, housewares, crafts, books, pictures, and more of things like that and the second building has furniture and lamps.  We’ll definitely be coming back!</Review>

<text>Cute little thrift store. Very clean and organized. The employees there are so friendly and always welcoming. In particular, I appreciate how safe they keep their customers. Masks are required and they do a temperature check before you walk in ‐ so appreciated.

While I'm not much of a jewelry-type of person myself, I always notice their wide array of jewelry: earrings, necklaces, broaches, pearls, tiaras - all sorts of things are kept behind a locked, glass container. It's a beautiful collection of wearable treasures.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>{'time': 1601212909352, 'text': 'Thank you Eden!\nWe do have quite a bit of jewelry- the second Saturday of every month all jewelry is 50% off.\nStay safe, and we hope to see you soon!'}< /resp><Gmap_id>0x80dcd9fe183016d3:0x5647b6f87c9daa5b</Gmap_id></record>

A well run operation. All donations are really well grouped. The furniture amazed me again. I was looking for a fireplace screen. But, only found 2 fireplace tools sets where both were great quality.< /Review>

But no fitting rooms, so I put back 8 of the 10 items. Get up to the register and hear they don't take Amex, so I put it down and left. Maybe next time I'll be more outgoing.< /review><user>115509167043889353403</user>< Name>

However, alot of items are dusty  and look worn out including clothes, curtains, board games, etc. But you'll never know what you could find here! Prices ranges from $1-$8 or more. The items displayed by the windows are unique and seem more of a bargain to get.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80dcd9fe183016d3:0x5647b6f87c9daa5b</gmap_id></record>

I've been shopping here for 9+ years. Extremely snobby workers...they work/volunteer at the thrift store but they look down on you for shopping at the thrift store :-| ---the one younger lady, maybe in her 40's, blonde, chubby is THE ABSOLUTE WORST!!! The rudest worker HANDS DOWN!<//text>

(Translated by Google) They sell second-rate things is not very expensive but there are times when you can find something you need and other times it does not depend on what you are looking for, be it clothes or jackets

Be careful when you get to repair your car, make sure that they tell you what your car needs,  manager Alan does not explain things well especially when it comes to sensors I do not go back to that place< /text>

<Review>Simple and easy... went in because my 2011 Mercedes was making a noise... at first glance I thought, I don't know, but I had twice seen magic Johnson there getting simple maintenance and figured he's a smart business man so let me give it a try.  Plus I didn't want to drop off at the dealership and have them recommend a bunch of nonsense I don't need and be without my car for two days.... so I get there and immediately a pleasant man named Alan grated me as I pulled up and noticed the sound.  He wrote me up a ticket and and said you can wait or I can have a guy named Jesse give a ride home or wherever you need to be.  He estimated two hours because he felt confident the mechanic knew what the issue was so I waited since there was plenty of food options around.
Needless to say, I saw mechanics start working on my car right away.   As I watched one of the guys called "e-shaq" or at least that's how I think his name is came over and started talking to me on preventive maintenance and how to keep the issue from happening again... not once did he try up selling me... then Damon printed out a few other simple transmission tips, which is probably the reason why he was on the computer so much... finally my mechanic Jeff came over showed/talked to me what was wrong, said his wife had the same issue with her car and that he knew everything about German engineered cars and by the service he showed I believed it.  I definitely recommend Jeff for everything.  I thanked everyone for their help and courtesy and went to pay... it gets better as I was paying Alan, another guy working found a coupon and Alan happily gave me the discount! Needless to say I've been bringing all my cars back since for everything...</Review>< Pics>

They work so fast and its the best price I've seen in Laguna Niguel in a while, plus they have an awesome coupon right now and it saved me like 30 bucks. That may not seem like much but when your money is as tight as mine 30 is just as amazing as 100 lol</Text>

I hate writing bad reviews, but I wouldn't want anyone else to suffer the way my fiance and I did! This was one of the most unprofessional places I've ever been. The guy doing the testing sat there and free revved my engine way more than was necessary several times. Sadly for him I have a video I'll be posting later online. They way overcharged, and were rude to me and everyone else they talked to. I would recommend not letting these guys anywhere near your car unless you want it back damaged!< /Text>

< Review>
Linda called after I sent an information request on their website.  She was helpful, well informed, and scheduled an appointment for later the same day.  I received a text before Benjamin came to my home.  He checked the three items I needed worked on (toilet, garbage disposal & hardware for shower/tub), checked the parts I purchased for their compatibility, and gave me a fair price,  Ben was courteous, professional and efficient.  He checked with me whenever there was a snag or issue that needed my input, and found the proper way to get it done.  He took the time needed to get it right, and with my home of more than 30 years it took some time and effort.  Thank you Ben!
Had th;em out again to unclog a drain.  Still a five star!< /Review>

<Text>Thank you Big John's Plumbing of Riverside for your speedy attention, dedication to detail and honesty.
It happened during a 16 hour power outage, our water heater died. Not sure if it was the power outage or the fourteen years it's been doing a great job of heating our water. Our son is a contractor and recommended we call Big John's Plumbing in Riverside. It was Saturday so we called and left a message. Someone at Big John's Plumbing called on Sunday morning and we confirmed that the repair could wait until Monday morning. Mr. Ramon showed up Monday and worked for three hours+ to replace the water heater. He ran into several non-compliance methods used when the original water heater was installed. He revised and installed the correct connections and insured we were up to code. We had hot water an hour after Mr. Ramon's departure.

We would recommend Big John's Plumbing, for any of your plumbing needs, I'm sure, but especially if you are in need of a new water heater. They've got you covered.<//Text><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

I have used John multiple times and will always call him when I have a plumbing need.  He is honest and always gives me options so I can make the choice that works best for our family and budget.  I believe that his prices are fair and I trust him to advise me when I am having plumbing issues.  I recommend him every chance I get!<//Text>

Big John's is my go to for plumbing issues in my house and when others ask me for referralsj to a plumber. Today's repair was a toilet issue which was done quickly and inexpensively. The first time I used this company it was an emergency sewer backup in my house during the holidays! They had a tech here in 20 minutes! They used a tiny camera to determine tree routes had grown into the sewer link under my driveway, then fixed the issue. (Talk about immediatley winning loyalty!) Thank you, John!</text>

I initially met John through Angie’s List years ago and was very impressed. Did not hesitate to call him again and he surpassed our expectations. Stayed until the job was done. Great price and would definitely call him again and recommend him. Call BIG JOHN!!! Love his work ethics.< /Review>

<Text>Many thanks to John Hernandez, owner of Big John's Plumbing. Ramon, from his company, came out yesterday and replaced our pressure regulator, which showed over 100 pounds of pressure. This was dangerously high. Now, it's at 60 pounds, which is in the safe range. Based on another quote we received, we got a very good price, too.

Another neighbor also had dangerously high pressure, which they did not notice until the water line behind their refrigerator burst and caused thousands of dollars of damage to their home.< /Text><user_id>112584796368450978955</user_id><Rating>5</Rating></record>

Big John came to my house last year when I had a serious slab leak. He quoted, analyzed it, and fixed it for pennies of the many other quotes that I had received. His work is performing perfectly since. This company is AWESOME. Thank you< /text>

First time using this company.  John came shortly after calling to repair main line leak.  Replaced regular piping with all  new copper pipe. He was professional, fast and the pricing was great! This company shines with integrity throughout. So glad to see there are still great people in this world. This will be my company to call whenever I need them.< /text>

Today I took on a small plumbing project as I thought it looked easy enough. Well after a few choice words, 1 large water soaked towel and a few buckets of water I called Big John's Plumbing. Within an hour a Big Josh's van arrived at my house. Marvin assessed the issue and explained what he was going to do to stop the leak. Marvin completed the task in no time. Marvin was professional in his presentation and I will definitely call Big John's Plumbing before I attempt another small plumbing project.</review>

<review>I am so grateful for Mario from Big John's Plumbing he was scheduled to come out the following day,but he called to ask if he could come earlier. Of course I said yes he was very professional & upfront on the cost before completing the job. He also made sure that he cleaned up after the job was done,I would highly recommend Big John's Plumbing to any & everyone.

<text>Very satisfied with the service I received from Big John's plumbing.  I had an issue with a toilet and needed help right away.  I called Big John on a Saturday in the middle of the day.  He didn't have anyone he could send right away, but did take the time out of his day (and potentially money out of his own pocket) to explain the issue to me and walk me through how to fix it.  His advice was good and I was basically able to fix it on my own.  I was unsure if I had done it right so I called Big John again on Sunday a.m. and he came out same day and helped me check it out.  He didn't even want to charge me (though I made him take something) and was very helpful, very cool.  I would definitely recommend Big John's if you want to hire someone you can trust and who is very much focused on customer service.  Thanks Big John!< /text>< Name>

<rate>1<//rate><Text>Funny how some people will do anything to collect some money anyway possible. I call this plumber to get a quote for a job. Owner John asks me to text him the property address so i send him my text with details. They go out and Marvin one of their plumbers call me and leaves me a message to call back. I call back and no one gets the phone so I leave a message to call me back as soon as possible due to the urgency of the repair. No call so I text back and request to find out what happened and to send me their estimate to my email or a photocopy of their estimate. No response until 2 weeks later I get a text asking for my last name so they can send me a bill for $105 service charge. Crooks. A month later I get a call asking for money so I kindly explain to them what happened and they tell me they sent the invoice to my email. I never received the email so I ask the lady what email address did you send to. She gives me the wrong email address so I let her know you sent to the wrong email address. I check to see if i sent John the wrong email address but no the email address I sent the owner is correct. So clearly some idiot did not send the quote to the correct email. Conversation leads to them threatening me that they will send this invoice to collections. They will get nothing from me for this rather I will make sure all my contractors, clients, and friends in the area never use this company ever again.</Text>< Pics>

He then told me that the actual repair would be $275.00. WOW!!

<review>I called Big John's on a Friday morning due to a stopped up toilet. He showed up and realized that he would need a longer snake than he had with him, and promised that he would return later properly equipped. The company shilly-shallied around all day, often not answering their phones and not responding to voice mails I left. Finally, at 6:10 pm, Big John called and said that there were some scheduling problems and that he would be happy to show up Monday morning. Our problem is that the person who needed the repair has a serious heart problem and his medication requires him to need the toilet every 10-15 minutes. Even that knowledge didn't move John to either get someone here to do the repair or to arrange with another plumber to cover for him. Big John's plumbing is a dishonest company because it doesn't live up to the promises it makes and doesn't make the repairs it promises. I will *never* call them again and recommend others to do the same. The company cannot be trusted.</review>< pics>

Our water heater was making really loud, banging noises for about a year.  I thought that we were going to need an entirely new water heater, but it turns out that it was just in need of a flush.  The fact that John came out and recommended the flush, and not a preplacement tank, was very nice considering that I was ready to pay for the replacement.  Water heater works fine now.  I strongly recommend Big John's Plumbing.<//Text>

Our place out in Riverside was having a few issues with drains backing up, even after we cleaned them out.  I called Big John up and he came right out, did a camera inspection, and made everything flow like new again.  We will definitely be repeat customers.</Review>

Fantastic, fast service. We had a clogged kitchen drain in an island with no clean out. I needed fast service in the local area. John was professional courteous, and knowledgable. From the first call to problem solved was an excellent experience. I would (and will) recommend Big John's to friends, family, and colleagues!</review>

John came out the day I called to fix my water heater.  I had been taking cold showers for a week and trying to fix the problem myself.  I'm no plumber!  It had to be at least 102 degrees today on a Sat and he still came out and saved the day!!!  His logo should be of a happy face with a cape!  I will be calling Big John as long as he is in business.  I highly recommend calling if you need a plumber!   Thanks Big John  :)<//text>

Everything was explained in good detail, so I knew I wasn't being unnecessarily upsold, he and Big John were friendly, knowledgable and courteous. The repairs were made to my plumbing and I feel confident that my drain will now function as intended without problem. All of my initial testing shows that their work quality is good along with the fit and finish of the work, i'm a satisfied customer. :)< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

I called Big John’s Plumbing around 9:30 am on Sunday after reading positive reviews.  The phone was answered right away and I asked if they could come snake because my main was clogged.  John told me he could be here between 11:00-12:00, and he showed up when he said he would.  I showed him the roof access to my main (which is unfortunately the only access I have).  He was very honest and upfront with me and took his time assessing whether his snake line would be sufficient to reach the distance needed to clear the line (roughly 100-120 feet).   It was so nice to have someone really assess the situation first.  I know some companies/workers will perform the work knowing ahead of time it won’t solve the problem, and then charging the customer for it.  John didn’t do that.  He evaluated the situation first and let me know before hand what my chances were of reaching the clog, and then he let me make the decision to proceed with the work.

John was able to clear the clog, and then he made sure everything was flowing properly before cleaning up.  Big John worked fast, competently, and was very friendly and respectful the entire time he was here.  The price he charged me at the end of the work performed was exactly what he quoted to me on the phone and it was $100 less than what I paid a big named plumbing company, for the same work, 2 years ago.  He told me he offers discounts on his website as well as on Yelp.  Then he gave me a 10% Military discount off my bill.  Thank you John for your fast, friendly, upfront and honest service.  I can now take a shower!!!< /review>

Ok.  To make a long story short, I didn't call Big John in the first place.  I learned my lesson the hard way and I will now NEVER use anyone else.  I went with another plumber and $2000 dollars later the problem was not fixed.  I had this other plumber over four times and he kept blaming my tenants. My tenants could not take a shower their first week there.  I was completely embarrassed.

I called Big John on an early Saturday morning and he swung by noon on time.  He took a look at the situation and took care of the problem lickity split.  My tenants were hesitant because of the last plumber.  We had water running in all the bathrooms, showers, sinks, flushing toilet paper down the toilet and trying to bombard the system.  What do you know..,everything was working.  Thanks Big John.

Here are my reasons to recommend Big John:

First: He was on time in my emergency plumbing issue
Two: Big John was fair and reasonable.
Three: He actually solved the plumbing problem
Four: He not only solved the problem he gave me some options for the future to make the situation easier but didn't use any scare tactic, just honest assessment on what to plan for in the future
Four: He is now my go to Plumber.

I had to spend a ton of money to find a plumber for life.  He's great and I highly recommend him to anyone.  He's a business owner/plumber that is fair, honest and reasonable.  He started his own business to run his business his way and I appreciate his knowledge and professionalism.  Thanks Big John for all your help!</review>

<review>John was the only plumber I could find that was willing to come out next day to unclog a bathtub. He was extremely friendly and took the time to explain everything to me. Not only did he address my immediate needs, but I asked him to give me a quote on a shower that had been broken for over a year.

A previous plumber diagnosed a broken valve and had quoted over $1200 for the repair. He also said they would need to create an unsightly hole in our shower wall or cut into the shower from the outside wall (which would add to the cost).

John was able to diagnose and fix the shower within an hour!  We paid nowhere near the original estimate on the repair.  He also gave us recommendations on a general contractor, electrician and cleaning service!

John is our plumber for life!</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

We had a plumbing problem at our home, and we hired a local plumber, who totally botched the job, and caused more damage.  Then they literally walked off the job, leaving a huge mess.  We called Big John's Plumbing, and they came out first thing the next day.  They fixed the original problem, as well as the additional problem caused by the original plumbers for less than half the cost of what the first plumbers were going to charge me.<//Review>

Food was delicious. Soup base was a bit salty to my liking but my brother says it's fine for him so I dont know its it's just me or the soup that's the problem. Our guess is the chunky meat they had places in there getting into the soup base. Besides that minor problem everything else was delicious. We ordered a sushi roll where they had scallops on top (forgot the name of the sushi roll) and it was horrible. The scallop was obviously from frozen since it was chewy and I can taste the fishiness that comes when something is not super fresh. We had salmon lover roll and it was delicious. The sushi went well with their spicy mayo sauce.

One star less because of the sushi with the scallop tasting all weird.<//text>

<text>Don’t believe most of these reviews left by people who have no tasted actual Japanese ramen; the truth is it’s good but I would rather buy a $1 ramen cup from Walgreens and I would be happier with that because it tastes about the same and would be cheaper.

<Review>At first I was a little perturbed about waiting outside on a Tuesday for breakfast but I was pretty pleased with the outcome. The staff offered tea to everyone waiting outside and was very cheery. Once we got in however the service dropped way off, our waitress was not very attentive and seemed to avoid us unless absolutely necessary. At one point we were flailing our arms to get syrup for pancakes. That said the food really did improve the situation. They give you plenty to eat, huge stacks of thick pancakes. We were more than pleased with the food. They serve both American and English style breakfast. I hope they can get a bigger space or at least a heated waiting area lol< /Review>< Pics>

Got the “meat lovers” ramen bowl and you get such a generous portion of meat for such a good price. The broth is not to my personal preference as I prefer the creamier tonkotsu broths. This can be just a different style but overall, the flavors are delicious and the texture of the noodles are just right. I do wish that the egg would be slightly less cooked and softer.< /Review>

< review>
We had ramen here one night. The ramen is just ok for us. The tonkotsu broth is not our favorite(not quite creamy enough). Egg is cooked well done instead of soft boiled like the typical Japanese ramen place. The barbecue pork and Chashu’s flavor is ok.

We like that they offer a nice variety of noodle and even a low calorie tofu noodle.</review>

Yesterday was our first time we came to that magnificent restaurant. But It is definitely not the last. We had a good time with the generous service, with the magnificent  food and wine and with the honest price. We will no doubt go back there soon.</text>

The food was great and well presented. Plenty of options for lunch and dinner combos. Service was prompt and the food arrived quickly, but not so quickly as to be suspicious. Our server was gracious and they even undercharged us for the meal. We rectified that on the way out to his copious apologies. Would recommend for lunch or a quick dinner stop.<//review>

Legitimate one of the best ramen place. Price was very affordable. Portion was enough to leave you super satisfying. The taste was marvelous and definitely is hand authentic. The service was fast and friendly and I can imagine this place mimics the same in Japan. More ramen places should follow this high standard as Gomen does.</review>

Since this pandemic we've been home dining but it's not the same as actually eating out. Ramen and other soup dishes just don't taste the same as they do in the restaurant. Found out that they were allowing done in again and had to go and try it. They have removed much of the tables and there is a lot of space now. Servers take extra caution and they have you use your phone to see the menu, nice because you don't waste paper like other places. The food was great, as always. I like the spinach ramen noodles with my dish. You can always use the yelp app to add yourself to the wait list and to get an idea of how busy they are. My family really like eating here.< /Text>

<text>Very traditional ramen place. Even the atmosphere is pretty traditional. You'll be really big bowls of ramen for just the right price. Don't be afraid to ask questions because ramen does have a lot into it and the employees are really friendly and helpful. When you arrive, don't forget to write down your name on the clipboard to get seated; or else you'll be waiting forever.<//text>< pics>

<Review>Ok ramen, great for its price but I think taste wise it’s just so-so. It’s pretty popular and seems to have a moderate crowd waiting outside right from the opening.

<text>How? How can such a simple looking bowl of ramen be so complex? The char Siu pork was blissfully delicious. The fat on the meat melted in my mouth, but not in the flavorful broth. I got the black garlic ramen this time, but you can't go wrong with anything here. All the workers were so sweet. Even though I caught the dinner rush, everyone was so pleasant and took their time with me. I appreciated the love that went into the food as well as the customer service.<//text>< Pics>

I live nearby and when I crave ramen, Im specifically craving Gomen! No other ramen place will do it for me anymore!! The staff is super nice, and the general atmosphere is amazing.
They do takeout too, which is lovely for a homebody like me :)< /Review>

Editing this post to add more compliments. It is not only delicious but the service is fantastic. Everyone is so pleasant regardless of how busy they are.
I came in and bought a couple gift certificates to give to friends to get them to try this restaurant plus help my favorite restaurant during all this covid mess.

My first time eating Japanese comfort food, but for me it was more like a healing food because I felt so good after I ate there can't describe it, the noodles were just perfect and warm and the flavor so tasty,  the best part since it was my first time I didn't what to order and the waitress was so nice to explain me in a very easy way how to do it, the place is small but very cozy, we didn't make line but sometimes the line is quite long< /Text>

I really like to come here specifically for their unique noodle options! My favorite is the tofu noodles (super low calorie at 10 calories a serving), spinach noodles, and kale noodles! I think it's a fun option and good for those who are a little cautious of what they eat, or possibly can't eat regular ramen noodles.<//text>

<Text>The best Ramen I've ever had at a restaurant. The broth was the best. I ordered #2 which is with chicken broth. Everyone else at the table ordered #1 or #3. The noodles were my second favorite thing about the soup. Really really filling and tasty. Everyone was stuffed and no one could completely finish their soup. I had pork for my meat. Someone else ordered the #3 which had pork and beef. Although the beef was super tasty, it was a bit dry (I know it's hard to avoid when boiling beef). I want to try the chicken meat next time. I will update once I do. Would definitely return and highly recommend. Oh! And it gets crowded quickly, so expect to wait if you dont get there right when they open.< /Text><name>Pars ifarsi<//name><Resp>None< /Resp>< pictures>

I am really not sure why I never tried it before, but now that I know it, I will come back here to try other things. Prices are reasonable, the people who run the place are professionals, and they make great food. (BTW their menu is long enough with a lot of options). Can get packed on during the weekend, and you will understand why. Cool, simple, delicious.< /Review><Name>Damien Orstrach< /Name>< time>

Food is great. But the place is kind of small, so there is always a wait. Plenty of parking though.<//Text>

Great choices and delicious Ramen every visit. The prices are extremely affordable and the service is quick. I always order the Tanmen Ramen with a side of fried rice. One thing that has changed is that they have a Yelp-check in system now. Makes it easier for Saturday nights since the lines are always long. I love eating here every time I'm in the area!<//Text>

Loved it!!

First time there,  but not the first time having ramen.

The taste was amazing.  Noodles were a little on the hard end... But it did not kill it.  Spices level of medium is perfect!!

I would totally recommend. And I will be returning... Especially on a cold winter day.</review>

<Text>Probably the best ramen in the area, good price, and good portions. You can be in and out pretty quickly if you do an early or late lunch but be careful if you show up right at noon, there will likely be a wait.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

The staff did a great job of accommodating us in their small place esp during the busy lunch hours on a Tues around 12:45ish. The #1 was a good portion and flavorful too. I highly recommend this place for their customer service and umami food<//Review>< gmapID>

<review>Really great ramen spot. As close to traditional  you can get around here. Busy nights - we waited around 5 mins, pretty good. Would recommend to groups/ families/ and friends. It’s a small spot so I’d say 6 in a group would be comfortable.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><rate>5<//rate>< date>

This is my husband's and my favorite ramen place. It's pretty far from where we live, but it's worth the trip. They have several types of ramen and I've liked all of the ones I've tried so far. Caution, they're not joking when they say something is spicy.<//Text>

<Text>I have been sick with a nasty cold. And I haven't been wanting to eat very much. My husband went and got me this, just the symbol miso pork ramen and I wish he had got me enough to last for the next week. It immediately made my throat and everything just feel so much better and it was by far the best ramen I've ever had.</Text>< Pics>

I have been sick with a nasty cold. And I haven't been wanting to eat very much. My husband went and got me this, just the symbol miso pork ramen and I wish he had got me enough to last for the next week. It immediately made my throat and everything just feel so much better and it was by far the best ramen I've ever had.< /review>

<Review>Not sure if they have a new cook, but the flavor of the tonkatsu ramen (meat lovers) has changed and ut isnt as flavorful as in the past. Which makes me sad because i love this place. My mom and i went here when she was alive and it always brings happy memories.<//Review><gmap_id>0x80dd292f377d7309:0xc2f4ae4462ecf97< /gmap_id>< pictures>

Gomen is one of the best places to get ramen in the area in my opinion, they have manga to read and pretty great prices. Service is really great too as well. I Recommend!</Review>

Some of the best Ramen in OC. After a few years they finally stayed opened more hours in the day which alleviated some of the wait times.  Service also always seems a little rushed.< /text>

<text>Great food. I'm not the biggest fan of ramen, but I like what they have to offer. Good broth, 5 different noodle options, and lots of tasty tidbits floating in the soup. Just had the katsu curry the other day and was hugely impressed. Came out super hot, good sized serving of crispy chicken, and LOTS of sauce and rice to accompany.

They are very busy at lunch time so either get there at 11 when they open or wait until about 12:30 when the first wave dies down. If you show up between those times, especially with a group larger than 4 people, expect to wait a little bit for a table to open up. Great atmosphere, anime figurines greet you when you walk in and it looks like they have a manga library off to one side.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Sometimes its a good day with good meal and service. Other times its a bad day with meh service and good meal. There are those specific days where its really crowded and really bad servuce where they forget to give you the menu and service you.< /text>

The ramen here is so delicious. However the gyoza does not  taste very good. It is too salty. You have to arrive early to get a good seat because right when they open there is a long line of people waiting just to get a bowl of their delicious Ramen<//Text>

The best ramen in Orange County. The spicy tonkotsu is killer, so are the gyoza and the fried chicken.</text>

Phenomenal ramen only topped by Tokyo. Very good spicy tonkotsu. All kinds of noodles and a few variations on broth thickness. Plenty of options to add variety to your bowl with meat and toppings.

Small place that can get very busy. Quick service every time. They have manga to read if you're into it and a small selection of sake that reminds me of 7/11 in Japan.<//review>

I got the spicy tonkatsu chasu ramen and it was delicious with the right amount of kick! My family and I came here at 6:30pm on a Friday evening and we were lucky enough to beat the crowd! This place can get really packed, which isn't surprising, considering how good the food is here! Totally recommend!<//review>

<Review>Small restaurant and can often be crowded.  Haven't had issues finding a parking spot but sometimes a short wait especially during lunch.  The ingredients are fresh for example they use real corn kernels and not frozen which I appreciate.  The noodles are perfectly cooked and not mushy (al dente).  The broth is light and not salty unless of course you choose the salt base.  Overall the ramen is excellent.

My only small complaint is that there is no substituting even if the ingredient is the same price if bought separately as an add on.  I didn't want to spend the price of the create your own bowl and only wanted to replace the bamboo shoots of one of the smaller bowls with corn.  I would have had to paid for the corn separately.  I kind of understand though.< /Review>< UserId.>

<review>Gomen is my go-to ramen spot near Cypress! Always order the kakuni deluxe with spinach (or sometimes kale) noodles and on healthier nights I'll go with chicken over the pork. Be warned, the chicken comes out more dry than the chashu (pork). I've had really delicious ramen broth in little Tokyo and in Japan, and this place is probably the closest tasting in our area. The service is quick and if you come before 6pm you'll beat the crowd. Their gyoza used to be better, but the last few times I've gotten it was meh (probably because it was packed and they were just rushing to get food out to the customers) instead of being lightly crispy it was mushy. Their takoyaki is good, wish the piece of octopus inside was bigger though. Will definitely be back here for my fix in another month.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x80dd292f377d7309:0xc2f4ae4462ecf97<//GmapID></record>

The most delicious Ramen I've had. Would have gave it 5 stars but the portions were small for a $10 bowl. The bowls were wide but not deep giving an illusion of more ramen there really is. We were not full, Im 155lbs, my daughter is 110lbs<//text>

<Text>I order my ramen differently, but I can honestly say the soy sauce ramen is good in flavor!  It has green onion a few small pieces of bbq pork a half egg, a few bamboo shoots and comes with the ramen noodles.   Really flavorful and better than some ramen spots out there.  Shen sen still hits the spot tho!   The kimchi has changed in flavor in my opinion but it’s otherwise good- just some times they serve little and sometimes much more.  So consistency is not always there on side orders.  I’ve heard the curry is good- not a curry fan but def on the rice bowls.. all good.< /Text>< time>

I like this joint. Solid and consistently great ramen with good customization options. The side dishes are also worth getting (Japanese fried chicken). The tonkotsu kotteri is where it's at - rich deep flavors make this my go to.</text>

< Review>
I ordered the Deluxe and let's just say that the presentation of the ramen was better than its taste. The broth must have been at the bottom of the barrel or something because it was one of the saltiest ramen broth that I've ever experienced. I actually used my cup of water to dilute the soup, but that didn't help.

Service was non-existent, the waitress came to take the order and drop off the check, that's about it. I flagged her down to order black sesame ice cream. That ice cream was the saving grace to this meal, which is why I've given 2 stars instead of 1. The scoop was rather small and I ate it quickly to offset the saltiness of the ramen broth.

I won't be returning to Gomen.< /Review>

Gomen has some really good, yet really affordable ramen.  The servings are decent for the price.  It is a Japanese ramen spot, fit with Japanese TV shows and manga. Service here is really nice and friendly.</Text>

This is still one of my favorite Ramen places. The noodles are al dente and have a good bite to them. The broth is very rich. They are generous with their meets.

The quality has gone down since the first times I've been here. Hope it doesn't continue to slide. The broth is also getting much more saltier and saltier than I remember has well.<//review>

<Review>Service (one of two stars)
Accommodates water, dishware, and silverware at an appropriate pace. When ordering a custom order they will give you a paper to fill out. Unfortunately they speak very little English, but I would say this adds to the authentic experience.

Food quality (1.5 of two stars)
The ordered food was edible and consistent with what I expect a Ramen to taste like. The bowls and plates were themes but look like they came from Daiso. They have cold noodles for the summertime and Japanese people can be seen dining here - which means they must be doing something right.

Ambiance (one of one star)
It is clear they are a Ramen restaurant that has been modified to meet the American culture. They reasonably price their food.
Nice lighting, plain paintings, a manga library, a few gundamn figures, and T-shirt uniforms to identify employees. The employees greet you in Japanese, which give the experience authenticity. Parking is abundant.

Overall a nice family owned restaurant with some hired help. 3.5 stars, I'll round up 4. I will be back to curb my Ramen cravings from time to time.</Review><time>1499394051786</time>< user_name>

Their #1 The Tonkatsu Miso is to die for.  Occasionally the soup is a little salty so you can ask for broth to remedy it<//review>

Service was a bit slow even for a small cozy location and wasn't that busy when we got there.  Food quality was ok but not worth the price.</Text>

< Review>
The Deluxe ramen was about half off for ramen week.  It's a good size bowl of tonkatsu broth, thin ramen with a few pieces of bbq pork and pork belly, seaweed and corn.  Overall I thought it was a pretty average bowl of ramen.  Maybe not to my liking but hey everyone has their own likes and dislikes.

The service alone made me not want to come back.  It could be because they got rushed for ramen week, I hope that was the reason.

Small place, rushed service with a average product.  I'd pass on this place as the OC has so many other places to eat.<//Review>

Sweet modern little Ramen place with wide range of broth and flavor options, excellent fast service, and nice spacious interior.
We ate both soy sauce and miso ramen noodles and they were flavorful and clean tasting, not greasy. Our order also came surprisingly fast.
Gyoza dumplings were crispy with vegetable filling.
Mochi ice cream and almond jelly were excellent.
Check their hours before planning a visit, they are closed after lunch like so many Japanese restaurants.
Definitely worth a trip.</text>

Go forth, Go prosper, Gomen

LALALA Ramen pass stop #1

50% off spicy tonkotsu miso ramen

Deciding to lunch at Gomen during the designated LALALA Ramen pass hours, apparently I wasn't the only one.  The place was packed with diners with the same idea.  However, the wait time was only around 10 minutes, so it wasn't long before my slurpfest commenced.

Sitting at the counter, I couldn't wait to dive into my bowl of spicy tonkotsu miso ramen.

Of course, I had to add white & red pepper, along with chili oil to kick things up a notch to my liking.

The spicy tonkotsu miso ramen did not disappoint!  Delicious broth, al dente noodles, a few slivers of pork and the rest of the gang warmed my tummy.  Some people like to sweat out toxins in the sauna.  I, however, like to sweat out toxins by eating spicy foods!  The floodgates of my sweat glands opened up as I tore into each fiery spoonful of broth.  My fellow ramen lovers with me at the counter were also sweating it out to the oldies with me ;p  I would've preferred the egg to be runny, as opposed to hardboiled, but knowing that some ramen places charge extra for egg, it's only a minor gripe.  Also, the amount of pork, while tasting good, seemed to be lacking.  Of course, seeing how my bowl of ramen only cost $4.25 + tax, maybe that's the reason why for the apparently miniscule amount of meat.

I was as happy as a fly on dog poop, savoring each slurp & gulp of my piping hot bowl of ramen until I proudly registered myself as an upstanding member of the Clean Plate Club.

Service was sufficient, as tables were promptly cleaned & readied for waiting guests.  Seating for 5 at the counter, with tables packed with ramen lovers throughout the rest of the restaurant.  Parking is in a private lot & can be hard to come by, depending upon when you go.

Gomen, domo arigato!  Your spicy tonkotsu miso ramen hit the spot just right!  My first stop with my LALALA Ramen Pass was a winner!  When I come back, and oh yes, I will be back, I'll have to order your highly regarded kakuni ramen.  Until then, sayonara!

Highly recommend!

(Translated by Google) It was a nostalgic ramen against the appearance and menu lineup.

In the 1990s, when I lived in the Kanto region, I often feel the atmosphere of Chinese soba noodles.

Yes, it was written on the signboard, but it is an image of Chinese noodles.

There are various types of noodles so I would like to try it next time.

(Original)
見た目やメニューのラインナップに反して懐かしい感じのラーメンでした。

1990年代、関東に住んでた頃によく食べた中華そばのような雰囲気を、根底に感じます。

そう、看板にも書いてありましたが中華そばのイメージです。

麺は色々種類があるようなので次回はトライしてみたいです。< /text>

(Translated by Google) It’s a very good Japanese ramen, so the soup will be salty. People who are afraid of salty can order wild ramen, which will be slightly lighter, but still delicious.
The ramen of the ramen is very soft and tender.
Good!

(Original)
很道地的日式拉麵,所以湯頭會偏鹹. 怕鹹的人可以點野菜拉麵, 稍微會淡些, 但還是很好吃
綜合拉麵的叉燒都很軟嫩
good!</text>
