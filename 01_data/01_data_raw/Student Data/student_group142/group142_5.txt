Wonderful experience! Very organized, loved the ease of doing all of my paperwork online from my iPhone, you move through the office and are treated so well all the way through. Dr. Jared and his team are incredibly knowledgeable and take very good care of you. Also, there are so many other options to enhance your smile. I was there longer than your typical appointment bc I was a new patient and the team really took the time to get to know me and find out my concerns etc. and honestly it truly didn’t even feel like I was there that long. Good vibes in the office.  Will be back in 6 mos :) Also, I’m sending my mom & family in.< /text>

<review>For year's I've needing an implant, I've been to scared to get it done. I've been going to Packard Dental for almost 2 years now and finally got my much needed implant done. Dr. Matt and his assist (don't recall her name) were amazing. They made me feel very comfortable. The process was very fast and they made it seem so easy. Prior to this appointment all my cleanings have also been amazing. All staff I've come across at all my visits have been great. I highly recommend Packard Dental to anyone!<//review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Tiffany has been my hygienist for years and I honestly love getting my teeth cleaned! The office is very professional, extremely clean and very organized.  Most likely will never change dentist unless I need to move out of state 😁< /review>

The RDA who did my cleaning today was absolutely so awesome!! She was very gentle, made me feel comfortable, offered way cool flavors of fluoride or paste (which I had NO IDEA they had such awesome flavors!!) and overall is a beautiful facility with genuinely nice people. I would highly recommend to family and friends! Very happy that I found this dentist!</Review>

Packard Dental is amazing... such thorough service from everyone in your office — from the first call to the appointment reminders to the excellent technician care, personal visits by the dentists to the top-of-the-line equipment and beautiful office space to the sugar-free lollipops, Packard Dental treats everyone with utmost care and respect and professionalism.  I, and my whole family, are so happy to have found them! We trust them completely; so can you and your family and friends...</Text>

I have been afraid of the dentist my whole life. My teeth were in bad shape and I was always in pain. Dr. Jared has changed my life. I can smile again, I'm not in pain anymore, and most importantly I can walk into my dentist appointment without anxiety.

Would recommend anyone to go here.< /text>

I had a really great experience with Dr. Matt Packard. The office was able to get me in on short notice for what I thought was an urgent issue. The front office staff were super helpful and friendly, the office was clean and calm, well organized and everything felt streamlined and state-of-the-art. I'm super happy that I found them, and I don't doubt that anybody would love it here.< /Review>

I do not ever leave reviews but this place is just too good not to sing their praises. My parents, siblings and I have gone to Packard Dental for many, many years. After moving a bit too far away a few years back, I returned today for my first appointment in quite some time. Walking in I was instantly reminded why I love this place. EVERY interaction is so positive and professional. From the receptionists, to the dental hygienist and of course the doctors (shout out to Dr. Matt!)- every person is so kind, helpful, compassionate and knowledgeable. They truly get to know you and make every effort to make you feel comfortable. They are not trying to nickel and dime you or upsell you. They are genuinely there to help you make the best decisions about your dental care and leave their offices feeling good. Can't recommend them enough!<//review>

I was fit in quickly for a broken tooth. As usual, Dr Jerod was very pleasant, professional and worked quickly to repair my tooth. I needed a partial crown which was made in house. A very fast and rewarding emergency visit.  This is the best dental practice I have ever been to.< /Review>

It is extremely important to me that my clients have the absolute best care and experience when recieving health care services. Packard Dental delivered and exceeded both my client and my expectations.  From the moment I called to schedule the first appointment I was greeted with respect and kindness.  As was my client and her son when we stepped into their office. The assessment and examination was thorough. The team made my client feel comfortable and explained every detail along the way. And I really love that they follow up to make sure that the service provided was more than satisfactory. And it did it always is.

<Text>I was referred to Packard Dental from a good friend and coworker. My friend spoke highly of Packard's Dental Group. I must say, I was blown away from the first phone for my initial check up appointment, to the attention of every detail of my experience.  The receptionist greeted me with smiles even through their masks. Victoria brought me in, gave me the grand tour (very impressive) Doctor Matt gave me a complete check up, maintenance plan, and got me started right away with repairing my dental issues. I have been afraid to go to the dentist for years due to bad painful experience. Doctor Matt and his assistant Nancy performed a Root canal, implant, and a couple of crowns with little to no pain. If you're looking for a fantastic experience,  a Dental group that treats you like family, look no further than Packard Dental. I will be referring all my family and friends. Thank you Matt, Nancy, Nicole, Victoria, Melissa and all of the amazing staff.<//Text><GmapID>0x80dc721a8be2768b:0xe6b20fe2eef1a599< /GmapID><pics>None< /pics><resp>None</resp><Rate>5</Rate></record>

<review>The Packard family are renowned for dentistry, for good reason. They are well educated, skilled, "fair dealing", and personable. I grew up in Carlsbad in the 80's and went to their clinic. They kept me informed and clean, no fillings (I can't say the same for my time before, going to to Carlsbad dental firm "Peterson and Sundquist"). Now, 40 years later, Dr. Matt is continuing the service and I couldn't be happier. Honest, thoughtful, and adept medical expertise works hand in hand with organized, friendly, and informed staff. Dental health is critical for all of us. Dental pain alone is enough to prove that point, but it is only the tip of the iceberg. Bad teeth are deadly. They brought down Ramses the Second, the most powerful pharaoh of Egypt! If Doc Matt had been Ramses the Second's dentist, I think Ramses would have had another ten years. I'm not sure if Moses would still be wandering then, though, and Ramses, frankly, had issues. Those extra ten years could have been a lot more enslavement and persecution for someone, because that was his business model.  Besides, these advances in dentistry had not yet been invented. The point is that Packard Dental is a great clinic for your dental health needs. And, no, no one paid me to write this. It's just my rambling and anti-Ramses the Second protest.</review>< Pics>

I had 10 veneers done with Dr. Matt yesterday and it was such a pleasant experience. He gave me an oral sedative which made the 3 hour appointment feel like 20 minutes. It was completely pain free and I was so relaxed that I even fell asleep for most of it. His assistant, Lis, was so comforting and great at her job. My temporary veneers look amazing and I'm completely pain free today. I couldn't have asked for a better experience!</review>

I can’t say enough good things about Packard. First of all, it’s like walking into Pleasantville. I was taken aback when I had my first appointment a few years ago... this place had an ora about it like no other medical office I had been to. Everyone there is incredibly happy and always smiling. You can’t walk out without having a smile too.
My stepdaughters are 9 and 11- they genuinely look forward to going here. They are jealous of each other if one has an appointment and the other doesn’t. They are so kind and willing to do whatever they can to help you, even if it’s last minute. This is not a business; this is a family doing what they love. I’m not just speaking about Matt and Jared, but also the people who work there. It’s like they have a happy-meter that they use to determine if someone is pleasant and warm enough to work there.
On the other hand, their work may even be better than their personalities... they are so gentle, pay close attention to detail and make sure that you’re comfortable when you’re there. I’ve had A LOT of work done there and got my braces there. For the around 40 appointments or more that I’ve had there, I have not had one bad experience, not even for a second.

Thank you so much, guys! You and the crew are absolutely amazing!<//Text>

I just got my braces on a few months ago. Amanda and Dr. Jared are so good! It was painless and my smile is already getting better!  And when Nicole cleans my teeth, even with all the brackets and wires, she still gets them perfectly clean.< /Review>

I was so impressed with Sean the Hygienist today. He was so pleasant and so informative with all his input about my dental health. I did not feel rushed and he answered my questions. What an intelligent and kind person.</Review>

<Review>The office is beautiful, the staff is helpful and friendly. They are great at explaining everything from procedures to pricing. And the hygienists, especially Nicole, are great - removing stain from my teeth and making me feel great about my smile again. Thanks Packard Dental!< /Review>< time>

<text>Packard Dental is awesome for kids. I had a cavity and wasn't looking forward to going to the dentist. Nicole got me numb and I didn't even feel it. Then the Dr. Jared fixed my tooth while I watched TV the whole time!! Fast, easy and good as new. Thanks Packard Dental.<//text></record>

Providing consistent, high-quality service to my family since 1988. I appreciate the extra care taken for Covid-19 protection. And the cheerful attitude by all staff in doing so. Latest dental technology is great including panoramic x-rays & laser treatments. Today I saw Jennifer & Dr. Jared. A pleasure - and who says that going to the dentist?!?< /Review>

We have been going to Packard Dental for years and have loved our experience with them! They are great with our kids and have a clean safe environment. Dr Matt has fixed a chipped tooth for me that looks perfect now and we are starting braces with Dr Jared this month and can’t wait to see the results! They have gotten us in quick for my chipped tooth and husbands painful root canal. Their office staff is kind and friendly also!< /Text>

First time here. I was immediately given a tour of the entire office, which was great. Everyone is incredibly friendly and helpful. I had several issues, as it's been a while since I've been to a dentist. They all took their time with me to explain things or whatever needed to done, as if I was their only patient. I can honestly say I had fun at the dentist. :)< /Text>

Packard Dental is the dentist you figured you would only find after you leave Earth and go to Heaven. All of the personnel are gracious yet authentic. I feel like I have been going there all my life. I have yet to experience even a twinge of pain which is testimony to the skill and care level at this premier facility. The spaces are tastefully done and immaculate. I'll say it, I actually look forward to going to the dentist now! Really!< /Text>

Packard Dental is an amazing experience from the moment you walk in. From the staff to the upscale ambiance. When you walk in the front desk staff is friendly and engaging. My first appointment was right on time (so refreshing considering most doctors are usually slightly behind), Matt was upbeat and honestly excited to check on my teeth. The x-rays went smoothly and as pain free as possible. Then off to my cleaning which was thorough and again very professional. So thanks to the whole team at Packard Dental for making my first dental appointment in a few years an amazing experience. See you guys again in six months!</Review>

<review>I’m writing this on behalf of my 4 year old son... but my kids LOVED this dental office. They had a pain free cleaning and the hygienist was so good with them. The kids loved the treasure chest and were so excited to be there. They have a great kid waiting area too which was awesome. Both kids are excited to go back for appointments in 6 Months! This was their first time at the dentist and it couldn’t have gone better! Thanks Packard Dental! Dr. Jared was awesome!<//review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

Doctor Matt was super nice and very professional. He filled a small cavity while I watched Tiger Woods golf on a TV in the ceiling. One of the best dental experiences I’ve had. Julia, my hygienist, cleaned my teeth immediately after. She was thorough and I could tell she knew what she was doing. She gave me some valuable advice on how to use the electric toothbrush I own. Thanks Packard Dental!<//review>

My 10 year old son has high anxiety when it comes to dental work (he was born with weak enamel and has had a lot of prevention work done). Dr. Matt and his staff are extremely patient, kind, and wonderful. My son actually hugged him after the exam. We feel so lucky to have found them ♥️</review>

The procedures I had  completed were pain-free and done quickly and to high standards. My hygienist Kendra W. was very thorough in her explanations and andwered my grocery list of questions with confidences, which relieved some anxiety and gave me peace of mind. I appreciate all of the staff's efforts to make my experience a pleasant one.</Review>

<Review>Very friendly and welcoming staff. I felt very comfortable with Dr. Matt and all of the team. I am a very nervous patient, and after walking into the office I immediately felt at ease. I hope that the actual work I have committed to, will be as positive of an experience. Thank you.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Excellent experience once again! I use to make the commute all the way to Costa Mesa CA for all my dentist visits. I have now found an excellent dental office in Packard Dental!

Dr. Jared prepared my mouth for the new bridge.  Professional and very caring office.  This is my second visit with them. I am so glad we picked this office.  Every single person knows what they're doing. So very happy with my care.  Still numb but don't expect any problems.  Was reminded to call with concerns or questions.

I have been going to Packard Dental for years now and they always take great care of me and my family. Tiffany, my hygienist, remembers I like sports center, sunglasses, and a chapstick, and has everything ready to go when I’m seated in the chair. With great service like that I’ll be coming back for many more years!<//text>

<rate>5< /rate><Text>I'd give Packard Dental 11 stars if I could. I had Tiffany do my x-rays and the cleaning. She's awesome- no pain in any part of the cleaning, she let me choose what was on the ceiling-mounted TV, and she had an appropriate amount of chit-chat while we she was cleaning my teeth. I was especially impressed with Dr. Jared. There were a few "iffy" spots on my teeth and he came in and said we would watch them closely, but he did not want to do work that was not necessary. I really appreciated that he put my needs over the need to do extra work for extra billing. Long story short, everyone here is extremely professional and skilled. I've been going to Packard Dental for over five years, and I would recommend them to anyone.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

I really enjoy getting my teeth cleaned by the hygienists at Packard Dental. They are friendly and the cleanings feel really good. When I meet with Dr. Jared, I feel he is very honest with what I actually do or don’t need for treatment on my teeth. I like coming here for my dental care.</Text>

Love Packard Dental! Their office is hi-tech and immaculate. The staff is welcoming. Dr. Jared is nice, helpful, and easy chat with. His assistant is sweet, as well (Belinda, I think is her name). I always feel taken care of by them. Has been a excellent experience both times I went for an appointment!< /text>

<Review>After a terrible dental experience 8 years ago I just stopped going to the Dentist; I always felt judged about my teeth and lied to about the condition they were in. Not at Packard! Since the moment I walked in the door (cheesy as it sounds) I felt comfortable and welcomed there. Nancy, Alexa, and Dr. Matt were extremely calming and made sure I had all the information I needed to feel at ease. Turns out my teeth weren't as horrible as other Dentists have said, I didn't have to spend thousands of dollars if I wanted to "save my smile". I walked in after having not gone to a dentist in 8 years and all I needed was a good cleaning! I now have my regular cleaning set up with Packard and I highly recommend them to anyone looking for knowledgeable and honest Dental Professionals.< /Review><rating>5< /rating><Date>1582072870562<//Date>< gmapID>

<Text>Packard Dental has had a long history of dental work with our family--about 32 years. We are very pleased with the quality of their work. We love that they are a family-run business. Recently, Dr. Matt has been my dentist, and I have to say, he is the most friendly and humorous dentist I've ever had. His work is excellent, and I'm guessing he is on the cutting edge of dental technology because he uses all new equipment that makes procedures super fast and pain free. I highly recommend Packard Dental.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

The office is warm, inviting, and modern. The staff are always smiling and make you feel welcome. But the best part is how great they are with kids. My 3 year old has had his first check up and cleaning here with great success. They are gentle, patient, and actually make him excited to brush/floss. Dentist visits have become one of his favorite things- I can't recommend them enough :)<//Text>

<Text>Dr. Jared does amazing work! My husband and I Love that Packard Dental is so family oriented and everyone in the office is very kind and friendly! From the moment we walked threw the doors we felt like we were family. I was new in the area and had an emergency root canal needed and was in horrible pain! I called and they made sure to get me in the same day to get me out of that pain and stable till I could come in the next day for the actual procedure! They actually CARE here and I'm so thankful to have found them. Who would have thought I'd be excited to go to the dentist ?! Hahaa the office is beautiful and clean! Very kid friendly and they do everything they can to work with out on treatment options and plans. Chelsey at the front desk is a sweetheart as well she's usually who answers when I would call to make appointments! So if your in need of a dentist trust me when I say THIS PLACE IS IT! My son just turned 2 and I will be entrusting our little man to Dr.Jarded and the staff at Packard for is first check up!!

Now complete all I have to say is that these guys are great. My smile is wonderful and my face now looks like it did years ago. Plus I can now eat foods I thought I would never get to eat again. Thank you Packard Dental for everything you have done, I feel like a new lease on life has been given to me. I look great thanks to Doctors Matt and Jared, the two miracle workers of dentistry.

This is a great dentist office.  I have been going to Packard since moving to the area, and I've had a great experience.  I unfortunately had a lot of work to be done, but Dr. Jared has gotten me back to a good place and has put me on the path to a long, healthy mouth.   The whole staff, from the moment you walk in to the moment you leave is incredibly friendly.  The equipment and technology in the offices seems current, without the feeling that you're being overcharged to cover a lavish office. I recently completed a successful checkup, which is a huge milestone for me!  Thanks Dr. Jared and team.< /Text>

This was my first visit to Packard Dental. It was an enjoyable and smooth visit from start to finish. Dr. Jared, Kendra and Karla were all personable and authentic. They take the time to get to know their patients. Plus, they were all gentle yet thorough with my teeth! I always enjoy that feeling of extra clean teeth after the dentist.

Their overall service was excellent and I am actually looking forward to my next visit!</Text>

I was referred by a friend recently and I love my new dentist, Dr. Jared, and my new hygienist, Mindy! The entire office is super friendly and efficient. They also have a great system of reminders by text and email, not to mention the high tech TV monitors on their ceilings! It makes going to the dentist as enjoyable as it gets!</text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>As I said on Yelp, if I could give this place 10 stars, I would! I am a WIMP when it comes to going to the dentist as I had a traumatic experience in the dental chair when I was a teen. This office is by far THE MOST kind, caring, and compassionate dental office I've ever been to. Nicole is the best hygienist ever...over this past year, she's gotten to know me...listened to my story and understands my fears. The first time I had a tough procedure, they gave me flowers to celebrate my victory! This morning I went through another hard procedure and managed it without nitrous or numbing. The topical anesthesia was just strong enough, and Nicole continually checked in with me to see if I needed more or wanted to go for the numbing. They worked with me on bringing costs down, too. It's rare to go to the dentist and feel loved, but these people really work from their HEART. Can't recommend them enough!!! <3<//Review>< pictures>

I had a great experience and I am not a fan of going to the dentist. The staff was all very friendly and gentle. I went there because Kendra one of the hygienists raved about how nice the office was and how accommodating the staff is. I am thrilled to have found a new place to go that is super clean, state of the art and most of all gentle and well trained! Thank you Packard Dental!</text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>I recently moved from Atlanta, Ga to the San Diego area. I work close by so the location is perfect! Before moving I'd been seeing the same dentist office for over 20 years so choosing a new place felt a bit daunting. I couldn't have chosen better than Packard. Everyone was kind and welcoming and I had a great experience.

The dentist I saw was Dr. Jared Packard and he made the exam process painless. Very pleasant demeanor as well.

The hygienist I saw was Kendra and she also did a wonderful job on my cleaning. Super friendly and great with making sure I was totally comfortable and pain-free through the whole thing. I've had a bad experience before with feeling like my mouth was being stretched way too much so I'm glad to have found someone who won't do that!

I'll be coming back for my regular cleanings :)< /review>< Pictures>

<review>This place is the best! I came here originally for an exam to get my wisdom teeth out and stayed ever since. Mark, Jared, and Matt are really sincere dentists that are great at what they do. Nicole is the best for cleanings and check ups! She has amazing rapport and lots of knowledge - so great! Overall, super great patient relationships and they’re all committed to making sure you leave with a great experience and some super clean teeth! Amanda helped me with my ortho consult and she was just wonderful. Rosie has done all the work behind the scenes with my insurance and has even dealt with making quotes for me when my insurance was changing over. Is there anyone on this team that isn’t great?< /review>< Time>

<Review>For various reasons, I haven't had the best luck with my past dental experiences which caused me to jump from office to office. I was referred to Packard Dental by a co-worker at the beginning of the year but didn't go in until June. I was very glad that I followed her recommendation! The experience was great from the time I entered the office until the time I left it. The staff was friendly and professional which made it a welcoming environment.

<Text>I have been going to Packard Dental for the past 12 years.  They are such a great office.  I love all the hygienists there, they all do a great job.  Dr. Jared is my dentist and he is the best!  Everyone is caring, pleasant, efficient more than competent and professional.  I recently moved down to San Diego but will keep going to Packard Dental because I don't want to change dentists.  Once you find a doctor or dentist you really trust and like, you want to keep using them even if it is a bit of a drive. I recommend Packard dental to anyone who needs good dentist.< /Text></record>

Very happy with Dr. Matt and his friendly staff. We were looking for a dentist we could trust and found that with this office. They took the time to explain the reasons behind the recommendations and really listened to our concerns. We feel confident in the office and have found our long term dentist.

Everyone is very professional and friendly. Left the office happy!!

Kendra did an excellent job cleaning my teeth and was very helpful with brushing tips. Also the water jet treatment after polishing made my teeth feel really clean with no desire to rinse more. Thank you!!< /review>

Dr. Jared has a great sense of humor, and is great with both adults and kids. We loved our Hygienist, Kendra! My daughter is a bit anxious with dental work, but Kendra was always very patient and kind, and explained what was happening.

The only negative aspect for us was an insurance change (Tricare switched fron Metlife to United Concordia), and Packard was no longer an in-network provider. Although we payed more out of pocket, we chose to stay because we had such positive experiences with Packard.

Our family has just moved out of state, and we will miss Packard Dental!</text>

I have a very busy schedule and they took the time to make sure the appointment time would work for me. I hadn't had an exam or cleaning in several years, but the technicians and dentist made me feel comfortable talking about my dental health. I really liked how they asked me what my concerns were and what my dental goals were. The office is very patient centered. My hygienist, Kendra, was very gentle when I explained my sensitivity and she explained every move she made. I felt comfortable and well taken care of!

I went to this place because of the overwhelming positive reviews. I am here to clarify that they are very true.  Maybe I have been exposed to any good dental/dentists before that led to my excitement. After the appointment yeah, I can't believe that I actually look forward to cleaning my teeth in the next 6 months with Janae, the hygienist is very sweet.

Packard Dental are by far my favorite dentists. They are familiar, friendly faces you never mind seeing. After going to Packard you will never dread going to the dentist again. Packard's staff makes you feel like family and always makes you feel welcome.< /review>

Beat Dentists in Southern CA!!! These dentists are all wonderful, I've seen them all! They're are extremely thorough, caring, and gentle. I have never had a Dentist or Doctor take as much time with me listening to my questions and concerns. I moved two hours away about 15 years ago and I still drive down twice a year for my visits! Try them you won't be disappointed. Also, the whole support/office staff are  phenomenal. They take care of everything and make you feel right at home!< /text>

More importantly, the work they do is great with both the assistants and dentists themselves doing a great job at both their work and informing you as to what's going on. They also do a great job to help you financially, something that saved me in a pinch after some massive dental work. They're a bit far from both my work and home but well worth the trip for me.</Review>< Response>

What an amazing dentist. I have always hated the dentist but the people here were so personal, friendly, and efficient at their job. There was a receptionist named Shannon who blew me away with her professionalism. Honestly, she was the key factor in my awesome experience. Thank you packard Dental for giving me my smile back!<//review>

The best! I have been with Packard Dental for years now and couldn't been more pleased with their professional and attentive attitude. I've recommended them to family and friends without hesitation. Whether it's a scheduled check up and cleaning, or an off hour emergency, we've never had to worry, they've always accommodated our needs.< /Text>

I've been going to Packard Dental for 7 years.
Today I had a deep cleaning for the first time.
Kendra did an amazing job! I, of course, was a little nervous but knew that I needed it done. Kendra educated me throughout the procedure and kept me at ease.
I would highly recommend Kendra and Packard Dental.<//review>

They will upsell the heck out of you. Really what they do is to be nice to you to get you in the seat as many times as possible for billing purposes. If you want to go there 5 times just for getting your teeth cleaned or a cavity fill at 10K go there,  if not go somewhere else where they will just get the job done for a lower cost.<//review>

I went to see Dr. Matt because I needed a new crown. He told me that he could take care of it in one visit. All their equipment is state of the art and he replaced my old filling with a new permanent crown in less than 2 hours. They value your time and don't make you sit around and wait. Dr. Matt and Melanie made sure I was comfortable the whole time. It was painless and looks better than my old tooth. Thanks guys!<//review>

We have been going to Packard dental for 3 years now and always enjoy good service. Our favorite hygenist is Nicole! She’s so good with our kids and makes going to the dentist fun. They always ask for her! They love getting toys from the treasure chest after their visit and of course look forward to the sugar free Xylitol lollipops too. We recommend Packard Dental... ask for Nicole!</text>

I've been with Packard Dental since 1986 and their care has always been of the highest quality.  They also keep up with the latest state-of-the-art methods and technologies.  I don't see how a dentist could be more skillful and congenial than Dr. Mark.  And I would point out that he is always looking out for the patient's preventive care and ways to save money.  All the dental hygienists are good; I'm just partial to Tiffany who is worth her weight in diamonds (get it?).  If you keep up on her good advice your visits with her are so easy because of her skill, you hardly feel like you've been to the dentist's.  All of these qualities are consistent with the entire Packard Dental group and their standards are the highest.</Review>

Since day one Packard Dental has been nothing but wonderful, professional, & welcoming. We have been coming for years and have never had a bad experience. They have recently moved into a beautiful new office that has ocean views and have the latest dental technology so they can give the best possible care to their patients. They even have blankets to give you while you get a cleaning or have other dental work done. That is a huge plus for someone like me who is cold all the time. ;)  If you don't have dental insurance they provide in house insurance through their program called the Packard Loyalty Program.  It is affordable and provides access to dental insurance to those who would otherwise go without dental care. I would say my favorite part is that they are all genuinely good people and they treat you like family.  I really can't say enough good about the amazing dental care they provide, the wonderful dentists, dental hygienists, and office personnel.  My kids even love coming to the dentist!!<//Review>

They earn the extra star on this review for the quickness in which you see the dentist. Dr. Jared was in my exam room within 10 minutes of me getting to the appointment. I have never been kept waiting and I am always greeted with familiar faces and welcoming smiles.
This is hands down the best service and care you can find. The new office is in a great location and I like all of the upgrades. I have nothing but positive things to say about Packard Dental.< /review>< Rate>

While I don't particularly love getting fillings or other dental work done, I can honestly say that every experience at Packard Dental has been more-than-pleasant. I've been impressed from my very first visit starting with their state-of-the-art technology as I filled out my new patient information on an iPad, continued with the text reminders (that are very appreciated in the middle of my busy life), and by the scheduling that is very accommodating. Everyone on their staff is very friendly and seem to genuinely enjoy working there. They even gave me a bouquet of flowers the first time I visited after getting engaged! I've referred several of my family members, friends, and coworkers to this office and every one of them has been extremely happy there. I'm so happy to have found a dental stuff that I can trust!< /review>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>The Office is beautiful and the technology amazing but the most compelling reason to keep coming back to Packard Dental are the people. Everyone you meet is warm and friendly and takes the time to answer questions and explain the process of what is being done. I moved here over a year ago and resisted replacing my Phoenix dentist of over 25 years but when a tooth emergency forced the situation, I was lucky enough to get into see Dr. Matt.  I am the proud owner of a new crown, all done in one day.  I honestly can't wait to come back for my preventive exams. Thank you, Packard Dental, for making Carlsbad a little more home.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Always "happy days" after seeing Tiffany and Dr Mark. Tiffany is such a personable young woman and a true professional. And Dr Mark, I have known just about forever and have always felt confident in his opinions, advice and dental expertise.< /Review>

<Text>I moved to Carlsbad last year and one of my main concerns was finding a dental practice I could trust and where I could also feel comfortable.  I have found both at Packard Dental.  Fortunately, I have only needed exams and cleanings so far, and my hygienist has been Kendra. I have one word for her, marvelous!  Kendra is friendly and warm, and gentle but very thorough.  She has given me some interesting advice, including suggesting that I use a child size toothbrush, and my good checkups seem to show that her advice is working.  The rest of the staff at Packard are great, so if you have any concerns about finding a new dentist, if you are new to the area or if you're not happy with your current dentist, give Packard a call.  Thank you Packard Dental!< /Text><user>114169886362096100148< /user>< gmapID>

<Review>After trying out many dentists my family and I were never happy with the services we received until one day a friend of mine told me about her dentist and how happy she was with them. So I looked up Packard Dental on line and I was impressed by all the positive reviews, to keep the story short I just had a crown replaced and two fillings by Dr. Jared Packard and he did an awesome job. These guys are great, I mean from the dentist to the receptionist they are all very courteous and professional. They take very good care of my family and me, and even my kids are not afraid to go to the dentist anymore. All I can say is try them out, you won't be disappointed.</Review><Rating>5<//Rating>< Pics>

This was my initial visit to Packard and I was blown away. The all staff was genuinely kind and used my name, Dr. Matt was engaging and attentive, the office is immaculate and decorated for the patient's pleasure, I even swapped eatery advice with my hygienist! The front desk gave me honest and helpful advice on affordable dental care and I want to send everyone I know there. In summary: I can't wait to go back in 6 months :)</review>

Going to the dentist is not one of my favorite things to do; however, everyone at Packard Dental is so nice and makes it such a pleasant experience that I actually look forward to it now. Kendra is so gentle when she cleans my teeth that I am no longer white knuckling it when I am sitting in the dentist chair. I love Dr. Mark, Dr. Matt and Dr. Jared - they truly are top notch and go above and beyond every single time to provide excellent dental care to their patients. I would highly recommend all of them - you won't be disappointed!</review>

Amazing customer service. The staff is always friendly and cheerful. Karla, who is a one of the registered dental assistant is very sweet and she made me feel comfortable and have less anxiety. Dr. Jared is awesome! He was very open to discussing my concerns or any questions I had. I have been to other dentists before and had not so great experiences, but not here!! They really care about their patients and work with them to get the results they want! I highly recommend.< /Text>

The staff here are really nice and professional. They seem super committed to your health and wellness, and that's important. The only reason I give 4/5 is because the facility itself/equipment is pretty outdated, but I see that they're moving into a new facility or renovating soon. Hopefully I'll be able to update my review then.< /Text>

<Text>I love Packard Dental! I see the dental hygienist  Kendra twice a year for cleaning and Dr Jared once a year for an exam. They are all very very sweet and gental. I honestly leave there in a better mood than when I go in.  I've also never had a problem with them billing my insurance or anything like that.  Today was definitely the icing and the already huge cake,  I told them I had recently gotten engaged and they gave me a beautiful bouquet of flowers to take home. Who does that?!

I have had dentist tell me for years that I am doing everything to take care of my teeth but I was still getting cavities. Dr. Jared took the time to make some practical suggestions and suggested I have an acidic system that could be contributing to my cavities. I have never had a dentist take the time to sit down with me and figure out what might be going on since on paper I am doing a great job caring for my teeth and some practical ways to help prevent cavities. This was so refreshing! Everyone that I came in contact with in the office was friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. This experience has really helped me to get over my previous unpleasant dental experience. Thank you!</text>< pics>

<Text>I recently went in for my 6 month cleaning with Kendra (my hygienist) and as always she does a great job, takes her time and doesn't make you feel rushed like other offices tend to do. The staff Is always friendly and attentive from the minute you walk in until you leave. I'm also 90% done with my invisiline which I must admit looks really great and far surpasses my expectations thanks to Dr Jared and his assistant Karla.

<text>We have at long last, found a dental office where we don’t feel we have walked into a lion's den to be intimidated by hidden charges and high pressure tactics for unnecessary procedures and medications. The office is bright, modern, clean and uncluttered.

<Date>1494282506589<//Date><Review>I really appreciate the time you took to meet with me and help me to better understand how I can care for my teeth. I have had dentist tell me for years that I am doing everything to take care of my teeth but I was still getting cavities. Dr. Jared took the time to make some practical suggestions and suggested I have an acidic system that could be contributing to my cavities. I have never had a dentist take the time to sit down with me and figure out what might be going on since on paper I am doing a great job caring for my teeth and some practical ways to help prevent cavities. This was so refreshing! Everyone that I came in contact with in the office was friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. This experience has really helped me to get over my previous unpleasant dental experience. Thank you!<//Review>< rating>

<Review>My first visit was very welcoming! I loved how well the staff received me and being judgmental free after not visiting a dentist in a very long time. The staff explained everything they were doing and what they were going to do to me. I loved how the staff engages to their patients and remembers them as well as their conversations and that's something I really loved. Not some ordinary dental place where you get your teeth worked and bye! Nope, not here. My boyfriend recommended it to me and I highly recommend it to everyone! By far the best dental place I've ever experience!</Review>< pictures>

My family has been going to Packard for 13 years.  They have been very good and have taken care of all our dental needs including crowns.  The prices are reasonable and the staff is very friendly.  If I need to look at a face while doing a dental cleaning I choose the friendly faces at Packer Dental.< /text>

<review>Wow, am I ever glad that I found Packard Dental!! I feel more like a part of a great family, than the fact that I am actually going in for a dental appointment! Chelsie meets me (at the front desk as I came in) with a huge smile and is very friendly and accommodating. Melanie and Erica, always so happy, have been Dr, Matt's assistants during my visits. I look forward to coming in every 4 months so Nicole can clean and assess my teeth.......... ..................and then there is Dr. MATT!!!! When I left Monterey, I thought I would never find a Dentist like I had there. Every one of my criteria and wishes are met by Dr. Matt's wonderful mannerism and honesty! He prioritizes, and does work taking my financial situation into consideration. I feel very blessed to be under the care of Packard Dental!

<review>I recently went in for my 6 month cleaning with Kendra (my hygienist) and as always she does a great job, takes her time and doesn't make you feel rushed like other offices tend to do. The staff Is always friendly and attentive from the minute you walk in until you leave. I'm also 90% done with my invisiline which I must admit looks really great and far surpasses my expectations thanks to Dr Jared and his assistant Karla. Best dental office in town hands down.<//review><Resp>None<//Resp></record></dataset><record>

The team at Packard Dental is wonderful.  Wendy works in front and she goes out of her way to work with you on billing or scheduling.  She is amazing and always has a smile.  I had a crown break in the afternoon and Wendy had me in the office  one hour later.  If you are looking for a great group of people that always puts you first, look no further.  From the minute you walk in the door you are treated with kindness. Packard Dental cares and they let you know it.<//review>

<text>Not enough great things to say about this dentist! I drive down from Los Angeles to visit them. They helped me get a tooth filled same-day to avoid driving back down and getting another day off work.

I've had a lot of bad dentist experience in the past, and I'm relieved to have found Packard.< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

<review>Very friendly staff and the most up to date equipment of any Dental office I have ever seen.  Belinda (dental assistant)gave me a tour of the Dental office which was staffed by many employees who were all customer friendly.  I was personally introduced to Mark Packard who also very friendly. When I left the office I was convinced that if I need any dental work this is the place I want to do it.<//review><resp>None<//resp>< user>

What can I say - I'm like most people and dread going to the dentist. But seeing as how my wife works in the dental field, I'm pretty much committed to going. I have to say going to Packard Dental makes it easy. Dr Jared and his staff are fun and painless. I am in the process of having my bite corrected with Invisalign which is going well. Tiffany is a great hygienist and reminds me to floss the teeth I want to keep... which I do - ha.

Yes, my wife works here but believe me the whole team goes out of their way to make each appointment a good experience for all patients.<//text>

She and Dr. Jared (who is consistently  friendly, confident, and comforting) filled in my cavities in no time! I absolutely trust Dr. Jared, he always informs me of what is happening with my teeth. I also love Alicia at payment:) Now I know what you millennials are thinking.. is Dr. Jared "Chip Skylark" worthy?? The answer is YES! I have never had a dentist like Dr. Jared be that concerned with my comfort level! Let's just say I won't be grabbing a dixie cup of Listerine with anyone else.  All jokes aside; I absolutely appreciate the care and commitment to excellence Packard Dental exhibit. I ALWAYS leave smiling.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

I cannot say enough good things about Packard Dental!  From the moment I called to make my first appointment, to walking back to my car after a deep cleaning (worth it), I was so impressed by everybody at Packard Dental.  The front office staff is so pleasant and friendly, my hygienist Kendra, was awesome (highly recommend a cleaning with her), the office itself is so nice and clean, and Dr. Jared was absolutely wonderful.  I have had dental issues my entire life, and have spent countless hours in the treatment chair.  I've not previously felt so confident and sure that I was in the right hands after leaving that dental chair as I did with Dr. Jared.  If you are considering a switch in dentists or looking for one in your area, please do not hesitate to call and make an appointment.  You will not be sorry!</Review>

Love this dental office!  First off, I have the best hygienist I've ever had, I love you Kendra!!  I was never the type to enjoy going to the Dentist, even just for cleanings.   I hate the picking and the scraping, but Kendra makes me as comfortable as possible and is awesome to talk to throughout the process.  I have one tooth in particular, with a receding gum (caused by clenching at night) that is super sensitive and she always makes sure to numb it (topically) and is extra gentle while cleaning it.  It really makes all the difference, because I no longer dread my cleanings.

Then there is Dr. Jared.  He is seriously the friendliest Dentist I've ever met.  I can't say I'll ever understand it, but I am sure glad he loves teeth and smiles as much as he does!  He has a true passion not only for improving your smile and dental health, but also a genuine concern and passion for his patients.  Last year, he did some major work on one of my teeth...a really awkward shaped partial crown, which he had to make twice before he got it perfect (I think he's a bit of a perfectionist!) I was still having pain a few days afterwards and was concerned about it possibly being infected or something. He not only squeezed me in that day to check on everything, he also gave me his personal cell phone number in case it didn't improve over the weekend .  By the way, the work was perfect and there was no infection, just needed a few extra days for the nerves to heal. It feels good to know he and the ladies are always willing to take/make extra time for you when necessary, and I've never felt rushed during any of my appointments.  No matter how many questions you have or how many times he has to come back in and out of the room, he will make the time for you.   And somehow, they always manage to run on time for appointments...can't beat that!

In addition, the office staff has offered for me to bring my toddler in with me during my cleanings so that she can watch and get comfortable with the what goes on at the Dentist's office since she will soon be a patient of his as well.  I'm also going to be having our second baby come fall, which happens to be right at the time my next cleaning is due.  Since I will be a nursing Mom, I was concerned about whether or not I could bring the baby with me during my appointment.  Luckily the office is super family friendly and accommodating.  I know all the ladies will be willing to hold the baby if need be, and I'm happy to say I would be perfectly comfortable with that, because everyone there is great! HIGHLY RECOMMEND! Especially if you have a fear of Dentist's like I do....scratch that, DID.< /review>

Packard dental is awesome! Everyone is so friendly and professional. I definitely recommend Packard Dental!

Update 9/2020: Packard dental is still our favorite place for dental work. I’m very picky about who works on my teeth! We currently live overseas and still go to Packard Dental for our dental care. Nicole is one of my favorite hygienists too, very gentle, professional and fun to talk to!< /Review>

Straight facts, ready?
Always literally so nice. You kind of forget you’re not at a friend’s house talking to their mom while your friend is out of the room or something, except your lying on your back while someone pokes around in your mouth.
They have TVs on the ceiling. Not in front of you— because you couldn’t see those TVs as you were laying down having work done, so what was he point of them— above you, so while they scrape off the plaque from your bad dental habits you are just watching the cooking channel and wondering hOW DOEA RUDY THINK THAT ICE CREAM IS FOING TO GO HE JUST TOLD US HES NEVER MADE ICE CREAM BEFORE WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU RUDY.
Not very expensive, especially for the service you’re getting. I know our insurance always covers most, if not all of it.
Painless. You feel nothing. I got cavities filled there and I kept waiting for them to start and then they told me they were done.
So also fast. You are in and out for a cleaning in like 45 minutes— and that’s if you’ve been slacking on your brushing like I do and drinking sugary sodas a lot because you have no kitchen so you gotta eat out a lot.< /Text>

I've been going to Packard Dental for years now and I have to say, they are the best!  I see Dr. Jared Packard and he's not only an excellent dentist, very knowledgeable and skilled, but he's also very warm, honest, caring, witty and, as a bonus, can sing beautifully!  I see Janae for cleanings and such and she is by far the best I've ever encountered.  She is very thorough yet somehow magically makes the experience painless.  She is an expert and one of a kind in her field.  Not to mention, a very lovely person.  It's so hard to find a good dentist that isn't going to tell you that you have issues that urgently need to be addressed when in fact that is not the case.  I've had several instances where that happened previously but the Packard Dental group does not do that.  That alone makes them exemplary and the office I would choose, I trust them completely.  But Dr. Jared Packard and Dental Hygienist Janae make the whole experience worthwhile for so many other reasons!  I would highly recommend Packard Dental to anyone!</review>

I had my appointment today, had x-rays and Melody was very gentle, as sometimes this is very painful for me. Then I met with Dr. Matt. He was really nice, and made me feel at ease. I have very high anxiety, and everyone made me feel comfortable. He was very thorough and explained all the options and laid out a dental plan that gives me hope. The technology is awesome. I had my teeth cleaned by Tiffany. She was wonderful, and we had a nice chat getting to know each other while she cleaned my teeth. She was also very gentle. I really wasn't stressed or anxious by the end. I feel optimistic that the Packard Team will be able to help me with a multitude of issues. The doctors all specialize in different things. One is general and I think cosmetic dentistry, the other is ortho and another is sleep apnea. If you have to find a dentist, I would recommend Packard Dental to anyone. I am looking forward to a brighter smile.<//text>

<Text>Kendra Witowich is an awesome person and worker with a great attitude! I would only want her scrapping and digging deep into my mouth because I don't like strangers in my mouth unless they buy me dinner first or at least have met my mother which she hasn't done yet but she is that good and I let her get away with:) Packard Dental is terrific and all of its staff along with it and will always be a place deep in my heart along with my gum lines cause I don't floss as much as I should.I hope this gives you some insight into the mind of one of your customers and lets you know that Kendra Witowich is irreplaceable and needs a huge raise along with months of paid vacation plus a puppy or kitten which ever she decides.

Thanks and cheers!</Text><Name>Trent Hensley<//Name></record>

I had my teeth cleaned by Janae yesterday. She did a wonderful job, I love how clean my teeth feel!! Dr. Matt did my exam and as always he never fails at making me feel like I'm being very thoroughly taken care of. Thanks Dr. Matt and Janae!

Update Review 8/20/17: I had my teeth cleaned by Allison. Allison is very thorough, and gentle, and made sure I was comfortable the whole time. She is now using a laser on my gums before my cleaning, and also for my teeth sensitivity. My teeth are much less sensitive from 1 laser treatment, can't wait to get more!</review>

I've been going to Packard Dental for about 15 years, and have always had a good experience.  Very friendly and professional, extending to all members of the staff.  For a brief period I went to other dentists due to a change in insurance.  I realized how different and better their service was, and had to have the caps received repaired by the Packards.  Can't recommend them enough.
As a bonus Dr. Mark is significantly involved with the community.<//review>

<text>I always have a wonderful experience when I get my teeth cleaned by Janae. I cannot say that about most. A lot of hygenists can be preachy, rude and condescending about how one cares for their teeth if it isn't exactly what they think it should be. She is ALWAYS so nice, fun, kind and sensitive LOVE her!!</text>< UserId.>

While Packard Dental always strives to put patient comfort first, they never omit important information about my personal hygenic habits.  This group lets me know well ahead of time any issues that may or may not come up to stop problem areas before they evolve into a serious condition.  Their personal detication to my well being has saved me stress that I would otherwise find with other groups.  One year later and they continue to provide great service.<//Review>

<Text>Complete with a friendly, knowledgeable staff, as well as many neat in-office features (flat-screen TV's in every dental area to keep one entertained), Packard Dental truly has it all. I've been coming here for a little over a year now, and the expertise and kindness showcased during all of my visits is unparalleled. The atmosphere is very laid back, and it's overtly apparent that everyone genuinely enjoys their job. It's been a breath of fresh air to have a dentist that is straight-forward and caring of his patients, as well as the quality of his work.<//Text>< Pics>

At first I thought the building seemed a little older and wasn't sure what I would find inside, but I have been very pleased. The staff is great and always go out out of their way to make sure you are comfortable. Dr. Matt Packard is my dentist. He is young, smart,skilled on the latest technology,and has amazing technique with needles.( I never feel them.) They can even make you a crown in the same day! I loved that I didn't have to return for a permanent crown and it fit perfectly.The hygenists are excellent as well.Support this local business,and you will be glad you did.< /Text><rating>5< /rating>< Pics>

After several bad experiences at dentist offices around Camp Pendleton, I was gratefully referred by a friend to Packard Dental! I remember at my very first visit they went over all my fears & phobias of dental visits; taking everything I said seriously! My dentist's humor, combined with the great attitude of the staff and dental assistants, made going to the dentist more pleasant than it had been for me in years! I refer to them to anyone/everyone I can, because I know what a difference they have made in my dental care! I no longer dread going to the dentist, and I now schedule my next appointments with them right away! Recently the dental hygienist cleaning my teeth, Kendra, was super gentle because I am pregnant and my gums are very sensitive! Just another example of the care and consideration that you will find at Packard Dental! Thank you Packard & staff for the way you have treated me!< /Review>

From the moment I walked into their office, I felt welcome. I was greeted and Jill, who I spoke with initially, remembered speaking to me and even though she was on the phone when we first walked in, she said hi when she was finished with her phone call. Great first impression!

We were promptly walked back to our room where Melanie took Jaces X-Rays. This was his first time at the dentist and she did a great job helping him feel at ease.

Dr. Jared was also very friendly and came and said hello while we were waiting for Dr. Matt.

When Dr. Matt arrived to our room, he explained everything step by step and tried to make Jace feel as comfortable as possible through his exam.

Once he was near the end of his exam, he started feeling anxious but got through it, and when he completed his exam, Melanie walked him back to give him a toy, sticker, and sugar free lili-pop, he just loved it!

Very great experience I will always highly recommend Packard family dental.< /review>

<rating>5</rating><Review>I was refered to Packard Dental by a friend about 4yrs ago as a new transplant to Carlsbad, and I could not be any happier! Dr Packard  is the most compasionate and thourough dentist I have ever met. My most recent visit was for a general cleaning by Tiffany who by the way is excellent at her skills. I was concerned about continuous inflamation around my gums, and after problem solving with Tiffany and the Dr, they uncovered that I am allergic to some metals that are part of the crowns I have. This has been a concern of mine for many years, through the care of  many different dentists, but because the Packard Team took the time and listened to me they were able to finally figure it out!  Thank You for keeping my Smile Brite!</Review>< Pictures>

{'time': 1488910414543, 'text': 'Hi Jason, I am sorry that your initial good experience with Packard Dental wasn’t matched in your most recent experience. We appreciate your feedback. We do our best to estimate your insurance coverage, but dental insurance companies sometimes determine coverage in ways we cannot predict. I am truly sorry that this happened in your case.  No patient wants to be surprised by a bill that is higher than they anticipated or a gap in insurance coverage that they were counting on using as a benefit. It is a frustrating situation for us as well to have insurance companies withhold benefit care to our patients. I look forward to speaking with you personally soon about this and hopefully finding a solution that is acceptable to us both. Thank you for your time in our office and I hope we can earn your patronage again.  Sincerely, Dr. Matt'}</Response>

<review>I love this place, reasonable prices, good pizza and pastas. When I order delivery they tell me 45-60 minutes, in about 25 minutes my pizza is here, now that's great service.

I had to update my review. This Pizza is very good quality. I've tried all the other places and it just don't cut it. Everything about their Pizza is delicious. I highly recommend Lamppost Pizza to anyone.</review>< time>

< review>
They have non existing products in their menu such as jalapeno poppers and ect.. This business is disorganized that they still have a broken toy machine in their restaurant. They also deliver if is only over 20 dollars. This whole restaurant is nonsense and a joke.
Except thanking users for commenting their bad experiments, how about fix it?
They also treat their employees bad.
Rather go to jack in the box for a cheaper and suitable price then this joint.<//review>

<rate>1< /rate><Review>We used to order pizza from Lamppost Pizza.  One occasion the delivery personal was caught on our ring camera coming back in the middle of the night and took my Jordans I forgot to put inside.  Today, decided to I give them a second chance and placed an order.  Order was taken but never given a timeframe or option of payment, personal who took my order just hung up.  An hour later called back to see when I should be expecting the delivery (kids were getting hungry).  Same person informed me the delivery was on it’s way, we live 2 miles away.  30 mins go by, I call again and the same person inform me pizza should almost be here.  Told him I like to cancel the order, instead of and apology or offer another resolution, he hung up.  Soon as he hung up delivery person shows up a minute after.  I would have taken the pizza if he had just apologized.</Review>< pics>

<Pics>None< /Pics><Text>I came in for the lunch special which is 799 and that included a mini pizza 2 toppings and a drink and a garden salad instead of charging me 799 the the older  Indian gentleman behind the counter said that the total it $ 9.40. I said that isn't correct it supposed to be 799 plus tax he says we haven't got the new menus yet, but that's $9.40 so he's overcharging people  if you don't notice it. I told him that he has  other Corrections on your menus but you choose not to correct the lunch special so now you're overcharging people.  I will never be back.<//Text>< Name>

If you call ahead for a take out order, they tell you it will be ready in 20 minutes- but they don't start making the pizza until you come in and actually pay. I assume they do this as a precaution to get paid, however my time is valuable and their pizza isn't good enough to wait. ✌🏽️< /review>

< Review>
Just spent over $50 on a to go order and the food was horrible. “Pizza Sandwiches” have no sauce got a couple of burnt pieces of bread with cheese and a couple pieces of meat and “mustard” on a pizza sandwich!!! Spent way too much money for what was delivered won’t be trying this again!<//Review>

<review>I will not be coming back here.
I ordered here once and a man helped me, gave me free ranch. And I was out of there.
2 days later I ordered the same thing, only
this time the woman made it the most difficult thing in the world just to order a large pizza for pick up? So I order, and she says, “I won’t bake the pizza until you are here since you new customer.” Me- “Excuse me? Why and what is the point of ordering for pick up then??” And would they just never bake my pizza at all if I ordered it for delivery? Haha very strange. Just seemed like she did not want to deal with it at all. She was very rude on top of everything else. And once I had to order again, and finally got there to pick it up, she refused to give me ranch without making me pay for it. Lmao if you are going to charge for something don’t just charge if you don’t like the person. Come on. Horrible customer service here.<//review>< pics>

Ok, so this local brewery is hopping (pun intended). Lively group. This brewery’s beer is off the hook good! The brew master has the Nor Cal beer style nailed. Family and dog friendly too! Cheers.</Review>

Nice Brewery!! Good beers, nice environment and you can easily order food from few places that are just close by. For 10$ you can taste 4 different beers, and drinking them in the sun outside... is just marvelous!</text>

At the time I write this review, Super Owl is still pretty young and going through their growing phase. The beers are good, but as always, there is room for improvement when a brewery is still less than a year old. Definitely worth stopping by. They have both outdoor and indoor seating, and are kid/dog friendly too. Looking forward to seeing this brewery continue to grow!</text>

The bartenders are super nice! They have an outdoor area with heating lamps. They are close to multiple restaurants so you can bring in food. They have good priced and sized flights. They have games and are kid friendly. Everytime we go it's good beer and a good environment.<//Review>

Worst acoustics I have ever experienced in a business. Cannot carry on a conversation, bartenders cannot hear your order properly, understanding the trivia questions is straight out. All the surfaces are plain cement with no real dampening except for people and windows. Just echos. Super stressful and unpleasant. I cannot stress enough how much they need to spend a few bucks on some acoustic tiles or even some carpet.< /review>

< Review>
Fun local brewery with nice selection of brews on tap.   They will give you a sample if you can't decide.  Big seating area with a couple of outside tables.  Staff is friendly and knowledgeable about their beers and can answer questions or make suggestions if you have a style you are looking for.

No food, but lampost pizza next door will deliver to your table at superowl.  Pretty cool.</Review>

This place is just amazing. Exactly what West Davis needed. There is excellent variety, often with 2-3 IPAs on tap. Beers are of high quality. The brewery is family friendly, and the owners have made sure it remains like that. There are board games, free snacks and great ambience.< /review>

Selection is limited but that's easily compensated with good service and well made beers.  Always great with Lamppost Pizza<//Text>

Super family friendly and they are cool if you bring pizza from nextdoor.  Beer is good - just maybe not at Sudwerk's level.<//Review>

Cute, family friendly brewery with a nice selection of beers and board games. Big on hops, be prepared for IBU bombs. No food available there but they have menus for different closeby delivery places.</text>

Kudos to Bees! The fixtures were delivered to my door within 3 days, well packed and no problems!

The lights are quite a bit brighter than my old 65 watt incandescent lights and only a bit brighter than the 10 year old LED bulbs they replaced. These are 800 lumen 2700K lamps. The hue is just right for our cream colored and light green colored walls.

Most of our lamps were on 20 year old switched- analog Lutron dimmers and seemed to work well. The dimmers range between 20% and 100% brightness.

I'm grateful for the cleaner and  more modern looking fixtures. My wife very much likes them because the old baffles and trim rings looked dated (by her way of thinking). The old maxim 'Happy Wife Happy Life' applies</Text>

< Review>
I was mislead and lied to i think. I called the company and asked if they have the light in stock. I was told over 300 back east. Asked for an estimate of time to delivery.  Told ships in 2 days and get it 5 to 7 days later. Never got the light after a week and called in again. I was told non in stock and coming from the supplier.  Would take 11 days for the supplier to ship it out. I got it a week later. I ordered it from bees lighting because of the faster delivery even though it cost more.  Lost my trust.<//Review>

<text>Horrific Customer service.

Bought exterior lights for a home based on their website info which showed the light as a 24". Turns out web info was wrong (still is today) and there are no 24" version of this light. What they sent to my installer were 9.5 in lights.

The wrong lights were sent & installed, now have to be removed & as there are no 24' lights in that model I have to remove & replace all the lights and go with another model.

While they will accept the return of the lights, I proposed I would buy the largest lights they make in this model which is 17.25in to see if that can work. But I asked them to match the price of what they charged for the supposed larger 24" . Instead, they want me to pay $218 for the smaller light which is $690 more for the 5 lights than I already paid ( for a smaller light)

Trying to speak w anyone in authority is impossible. I  emailed & received inadequate responses with no real solution and when I called - 4 times I was placed on hold ( 1 time for 24 mins) then transferred to someone in Sales who offered no real solutions. I was then told that the head of Customer Service Mike A doesnt have a phone in his office, though the receptionist put me on hold 4 times to transfer me into him.

Completely unprofessional & despite acknowledging their error really take no responsibility for it.

When you ask who owns the company, who is the President, who is the General Manager , etc, every person dodges the question & doesnt even know who their boss is.

Think twice before doing biz w these people !< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

Great experience.  We ordered several items which were shipped quickly.  One light had a manufacturers defect and Bees assisted with contacting the manufacturer to have a replacement sent to us.  They did all the work for us.  Will not hesitate to do business again!< /Review>

I was hesitant about ordering lighting equipment from an online seller, especially from one that I haven’t heard of. Well, I went for it anyway and placed a large order. All items arrived together and on time!

The website is straight forward and prices are much lower than other places. I’ll definitely be making another order soon for my home projects.< /text>

The worst online seller ever! Nobody knows what they are doing, or where your order is. I ended up cancelling after they could not give me a correct ship date. Customer service told me it was shipping the day I called.....like 4 different times. LOL. Don't waste your time or money. There are plenty of better sites.</text>

I ordered hundreds of dollars worth of under cabinet lights (lithonia rayzer line) since I couldn't really find this product anywhere else. Shipping time was reasonable (few business days) and processing returned items was very quick (1 day).< /Text>

<UserId.>113285481727166533415</UserId.><Review>Terrible management in customer service!
Bees did not deliver my order as promised then showed it as a slit order instead of as I ordered it. Which can be a problem but no big deal right?  Then when the order never came I tracked it and Bees tracking with FeD-ex showed delivery to my location 2 days before. (on 1/2 the order mind you, and already a 12 day turnaround on stock items) without a signature on a $1,800 dollar order. I called customer service to inform them and ask for help.  At first Bees customer service rep "Gabby" was professional. She listened and took action and was going to resend my entire order expedited on a 2 day delivery. Sounds great right, things happen. I was satisfied.  This is when it got crazy, 45 mins later I get a call from her and she apologised but said "she could not send out my order."  I explained I had to have it, it was holding up my CO. She said there was nothing she could do.(orders from above, no doubt) I told her I had to have it again and politely asked for her supervisor. She escalated and I got the same answer from her direct superviser, except I would have to wait for a Fed-ex investigation before they would re-ship my order, a potential delay of weeks. I then asked for a full refund which her supervisor, said she could not that. I then asked for her boss I was then sent to the main Guy the real customer service supervisor.  His name I did not get,  but who I asked, "Are you aware what is going with my account and have you been briefed on the problem". To which he said, yes.  I then ask him for a solution. My solution was either 1.) refund my order in full and I would buy them else where or 2.) send out the entire order together either overnight or 2 day ground as I agreed to with Gabby.  He told me NO and to calm down or he was going to hang-up on me.  REALLY? And then he took it farther and threatened me if he hung up I would have to go to mastercard and put in a fraud claim and try to recover my money from them, but he was not going to help me. Angered and Shocked from his responce to my problem. ,after all "Who tells a customer to go fight it out on A  FRAUD claim!" I then said are you F***ing kidding me? I said I need a solution at which point he said good luck or something like that and then HUNG-UP the phone on me. Now this is Management in Customer service!..?  Stay away from this company.  I will pay more to be treated as if my money matters and who has every heard of a company`s response is to fight it out with your credit card company? Let alone put in a fraud claim on a dispute UNBELIEVABLE!

This was my first time going into this nail salon and I loved it! She was so detail oriented and checked in with me to see if I liked it throughout the process. I also had a pedicure done that matched the dip powder.< /text>

Horrible, they were worst then that, I had to go somewhere else to try to fix how bad they were but they couldn't do a whole lot without starting from scratch, I spent 100.00 for my nails and a pedicure, big rip off</Review>

I love the way those employees treating me. They always willing to fix my nails when it mess up or I don't satisfy with the color, they agree to change for me with a full of respectful attitude. Probably a nail shop I will go for many years later.<//review>

It’s sunday and I haven’t had my eyebrows done in probably 7 months. It was so bad haha. They were open and Kali took me back and did such an amazing job I almost cried I was so happy. I will be returning here for as long as I live in California.<//Text>

I went to this place for the first time. My nails are all lumpy and with air bubbles. I could have done a better job myself. I addition to the bad job, I was cut during my manicure and the lady did not even notice that she made me bleed.</review>

Horrible experience. Asked for gel with the chrome finish. Although re-directed multilple times of my nail preference, she did not listen! One day later, I was left with chipped nails,  without coverage near the cuticle.</text>

They look like they may do acrylic nails okay but I just went for gel polish on my hands and a pedicure. They did not really seem to care whether the paint was on the entire nail or how good of a job they did. I would not recommed this place for gel polish. Will not be back.< /review>

Absolutely delicious, i was on the run so i only got the wrapped grape leaves and the Gyro sandwich. Both very delicious. But for sure next time I'll order a bigger meal for more to enjoy. The restaurant was clean and decorated so quaint, the people were so kind and respectful, and the smell from the cooking was causing me to drool.💜🍽 Can't wait to come back!</text>

<Review>Soda was dirty. I asked the waitress to change it and she was not happy. The next drink was dirty too. I decided to eat my food without a drink! The saffron rice tasted like burned bread. And the supposedly lamb kabob was definitely not lamb. It was beef kabob. This is from almost a year ago. They may have other chefs. I have never been there since then and I'm not planning to, anytime soon.</Review>< Pics>

<Review>Food was amazing Only problem was I was stabbed by kabob stick in my neck. Hard to enjoy my food with a stitch lodged in me but overall great food will definitely go back to eat with a helmet. And or possibly a shield< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< rate>

We had this Togo. The chicken, flank steak , were tasty grilled goodness. Seasoned just right with quality meat. The ground beef consistent in flavor. Out of the three, the chicken and steak were the best. The basmati rice fluffy and nice. Served with grilled whole tomato and jalapeno. Bottom line, the food is simplistic in form and good. $$. As always  explore wherever  your travels take you...< /review>

Absolutely the worst food I've had in my life and I'm not even picky. How can you mess up a basic Persian rice let alone kababs. Nice job on the raw tomatoes too.<//review>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>Exceptionally great food, friendly service, and lovely food presentation! Impressed with new ownership and subtle changes that make it unique to Betty's. We're previous loyal patrons of George's but are certainly happy to have Betty in town. Fresh tasty hummus pairs well with an aromatic Perisan salad over thin bread. I enjoyed a hearty plate of lentil soup which I devoured as my main dish. Spouse ordered the combo plate with chicken and beef kabobs that he thoroughly enjoyed. Servings sizes are generous, bring your appetite, or even share with a friend. Our server was charming, efficient (water glasses ALWAYS filled), and had a nice sense of humor. We are big Fans of Betty's and would highly recommend to anyone looking for a great meal in town!< /Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMzqTfYo9Tl47EDgJS8zH6tc6clTUKw4YCTudJf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMzT_2KvFwmcuEB0dHFPhVfoSL0oHB2XoV51Ag2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPddQmKgsavkDZLEQjwnlgHe-MXBM5OiZEliHuw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOUp6gs_trH8lo2VRvxLTpUdVwUoX9_aZxpaecw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNVxQCPUN6chCRKmkSZ7KehjkaRbTQyE04CAcE7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPpfwdcH9ZQi_fZrYAt5OUNtB3bdDqREP8FXVfA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOhko2Om9cm0qxojvrAazxZ8HPK6_fRDGf5OBst=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x809056c7cb8d6983:0x432875af1b9a0224< /Gmap_id></record>

Just had my first visit here today. The owner was so welcoming and hospitable. Plenty of serving with the koobideh plate that I ordered; fit for two meals for me. The basmati rice was so sublime! I'm planning on giving them a phone call directly to place my take away order again very soon!<//Text>

Welll, let me start off by saying I absolutely love quality, let me repeat, quality Persian food. I have traveled hours to go to the Bay or Sac to get something decent. We stumbled on this place looking for something that wasn't packed due to it being Valentine's day and all. Ok let me also mention I’m Middle Eastern myself and KNOW good quality ethnic food.
We called to see if they are open for dine in and the woman who answered the phone was so so pleasant. Very welcoming. So we get there, nice family owned restaurant. Very quaint. The beautiful Persian music was playing. We ordered our food and sat down to eat. I have no words to describe how happy I am to FINALLY have a GREAT Persian restaurant close enough to frequent regularly. The food was superb. The kubede kabab was amazing. My husband ordered the steak and chicken kabob combo. Holy smokes. I was blown away. We ordered two more dishes to go for dinner.  I want to try everything on the menu. Oh and how can I forget to mention the Baklava!!!! YUMMMM. I had to write this review quickly so people can spread the word. Lets support this amazing spot.</Text>

<Review>The food here is homemade and just delicious! Particularly if you are a little adventurous with your palate or if you are partial to Mediterranean food. We had a yogurt, herb and rice soup that was just great. Of course we had the lamb and chicken kebabs and the cabbage dolmas. The owner Betty is a doll. We will be back soon!!!</Review>< Time>

<review>I'm now on keto, I live in Tracy and it looks like I'll be making frequent trips to Betty's in the near future. Earlier today I told my wife that I was craving Kabobs and I really wanted to feast but didn't want to spend a bunch of money at a sit down nor did I want to fire up the grill and go through that hassle of making kabobs. A couple weeks back we passed Betty's after church but I was in a rush to get home but the smell of the Kabobs were stuck in my head since then. I called them up today and a lovely lady picked up the phone and I ordered 2 koobideh dinner plates, a skewer of tomatos, 5 skewers of koobideh and 1 skewer of chicken breasts. Let me tell you they like to add roasted jalapenos on the side for free which was an awesome bonus. All of this for less than $60!!!!! I gave them $60 and an extra $10 as tip. This much food would be well over $100 anywhere else. The owners were extremely hospitable and accommodating. I told them I would be cutting it close to their closing time and they said no worries and they waited for me. I don't think I'll ever make Kabobs at home anymore. I'll be using Betty's from now on for all my events. This is a must go to for Keto meats.</review>< Rate>

I'd add photos if the food had survived more than a few minutes haha. Overall the food we had was fantastic. Pita is great, gyro wraps are delicious and large for $7.99 (if you're getting your food to-go I'd get an extra taziki sauce), and the hummus appetizer is an amazing value. Delicious garlicy hummus with tons of pita bread to eat it with. Definitely worth a visit if you're a fan of Mediterranean food!</Text>

We had a great experience at Bettys Kabob today! The young waiter was very friendly and obviously wanted us to have a good experience there. The food was exceptional. They make everything from scratch I believe,  so it does take longer to fix than fast food,  but it was worth the wait. Go when you have time to relax and enjoy the experience. We definitely plan to return.<//review>

<Text>In my opinion Betty’s Kabob is the best Mediterranean restaurant in Modesto. The service is fantastic, the food is beyond great, and you never go away hungry. One word of warning: don’t order too many dishes; you will not finish everything
We started with Cabbage Dolma and Hummus and were full when our lunches arrived. Cynthia took home her Greek Salad, but I tried to eat the Chicken Kabob Sandwich. Everything was so delicious, but I ate way too much.
Oh, try the doogh. Fantastic!</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<Review>The lady at the counter was very nice and friendly. She made a suggestion on what was good and I like it very much. Later she came to the table and checked up on me and how the meal was. The food was great for the price and I would take my friends there to try it as well. The place was clean and a nice atmosphere. Well worth giving the five stars.</Review>< pics>

The staff is great and super-friendly. The burgers were very good, but the fries just I'm. If you can, have some of the lentil soup. It is the absolute best I ever tasted. We finished off with some baklava. Fresh and delicious all the way through!! We'll be back.<//review>

Portions are generous. Quite inexpensive for the amount and quality. Food is delicious! Came for gyros and kabob and they made it possible having both without having me order extra food on top of throwing in extra Gyros! Delicious! Will def be coming back!</text>

They stopped making the big burger but the food was delicious. Busy kitchen and we waited longer than we should but the manager was very nice. Highly recommended.< /text>

I got some food to go. food was not good. Ordered a chicken kabob with rice. Chicken had little to no flavor. The rice tasted really earthy and was not good. I had to throw it all away. Other places in town with similar food but way better.< /Review>

<text>The food is amazing, however the service is so bad that it kinda sucked the flavor out of the food. Me and my cousin went there to celebrate me getting a new job and it took over an hour for our food to get ready. We tried to ask for a refund and the cook lost her temper with us and dared to give us attitude! She was like well geeze thanksssss! What am I gonna do with all this food, and we said is been way over an hour. She said I am alone in the kitchen today. And we said that's why we were considerate but to a limit. How is that out fault? Then I told my cousin well if the food is ready we will just eat it because I don't want to waste food but she had it in to go boxes when were dinning in. We just took it to end the fight, but it really left us feeling bitter, unwanted, and a burden which is no way for a customer to feel. However the food was actually good I just wish we had a better experience.</text>< pics>

The servers are very nice. We had the gyros, falafel and sliced beef kabobs. The rice had saffron which was very nice. The food was grilled very nicely. I would have liked some Mediterranean music in the background and perhaps shwarma on the menu. The falafel was wonderful and I will definitely be back for more yummy eats!<//Review>

This is Betty’s Kabob now, not George’s Burger yet this page has combined the two.  Betty’s Kabob is delicious!!!  We have enjoyed the gyro sandwich, chicken barg, flap meat kabob, koobideh, and lentil soup.  Got to sample the new falafel recipe, too!  Mmm.  Great family, great service, and delicious food!!!!< /text>

<Review>Giant burger.  Needs more sauce and a thinner cheese. Also helps to put fixing on top of the meat so the bottom of bun isn't mush in the 5 minutes it took me to get home also decent portion of fries but under cooked I'd rather waiting 3 more minutes and receive fries that are fully cooked. was a disappointment.<//Review><rating>1<//rating><date>1451360495934</date><Response>None< /Response></record></dataset><record>

<text>The burgers rival.any of those from big chain stores. The other food available make you want to try them instead. So my son had the gyro's and I had the burger with some if the tastiest fry's (unsalted), for those if us with high blood pressure.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<Text>Not your average burger joint.  Walk in and... Opa!  It is actually a Mediterranean restaurant!  Authentic Mediterranean dishes along side great burger options.  Order at the counter, family-owned segment.  Great service.  Great prices.  The Pepperjack & Jalopeno burger had a perfectly grilled, quality patty.  Sitting in a freshly toasted bun with grilled, fresh jalopenos, cheese and tomatoes/lettuce/bbq sauce... plus a side of fries to boot.  A QUALITY burger.  Portions more than par for the segment.  Prices a little less than par.  A well earned 5-stars in this competitive segment.<//Text><Response>None<//Response></record></dataset><record>

My daughter and myself signed in and were seen immediately, we were in and out within a matter of twenty minutes! The front staff and the medical assistant that day were so polite and efficient! Once we were done with our visit my car would not start. The front desk staff girl was so nice and notified me that the doctor was coming around the corner with his truck to give my car a jump! They both helped me not only during our visit inside the urgent care but outside with my car! Genuine people!! Are so hard to find now a days. Thank you☺️<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

<Text>This is the most horrible place I ever went, staff are very rude especially Rebeca Ramekin, she was at the front desk. So much attitude and they not even do anything just making fun and laughing with each other, commenting about clients. No ethics manners!  Ladies go to school and stop waisting your time if you hate what you do!!! The Nurse practitioner was very nice and polite, she approached the matter in very professional manner if I could rate the front desk 0 and the nurse practitioner 5 !< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<Text>Horrible experience. There was no one in the waiting room yet I waited an hour to be seen. When seen the doctor/provider really seemed like she didn’t care and was not helpful at all. She wasn’t taking my injury serious and wrote me a prescription for 800mg ibuprofen after I told her I had been taking ibuprofen the last few days and my injury has only gotten worse. It was horrible I just wanted to leave bc I felt my time was wasted. So after I left I wanted to go pick up my prescription but it hadn’t been called in yet. So I called this place and they took a while to finally call in my prescription. Literally why wait to call it in? Am I not injured do you want me to just wait another hour+ to get the prescription.
Really just an awful overall experience. I never write reviews but created an account just to write this one. A+ urgent care if you are reading this then please act like you guys care for your paying customer. (I wrote customer bc they treated us like a customer and not a patient)< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>{'time': 1612395904388, 'text': 'Hi, Josh Salomon.

He did the necessary work very efficiently and then I waited for a short time for the lab results.  Then I was seen by the PA on duty.  She gave me the results and wrote out the prescription.

The Pacific-Islander looking one up front in her 30s she has been there for a long time she is lazy, very impatient, and always rude to many customers at the technology location in Murrieta. First star is for the customer service the PA’s are Exceptional I don’t advise going near closing they will rush you and make you feel like you aren’t a paying patient haha.<//review>

Their website and google say they open at 8:00am. They do not. They weren’t even open at 9:00. Their door says “Summer hours 10:0-6:00” It’s only may 3rd. Is this summer?? You call the office and there is no answer or recording saying their hours. I went to Los Alamos location...same thing. They need to change their website and google listing to reflect correct hours!!!< /Review>

DO NOT GO HERE IF YOU HAVE A MIGRAINE! I went here having one of the worst migraines of my life and was misdiagnosed two times and was told to get out upon the third time. On the first misdiagnosis they gave me shots which did not work. The second time the doctor was shouting at me and got upset when I asked him to talk quieter and told me that I need antibiotics. YOU DONT TAKE ANTIBIOTICS FOR A MIGRAINE. Then on the third time of going in there within the same week I was told to get out because they didn’t believe me that I was having these migraine symptoms. Ended up going to the hospital and he doctor and hospital staff gave me and IV with medication fluids that the hospital staff said “all urgent cares carry”. Ridiculous staff and I feel like the doctors just guess and are there for money not the patient.

Follow up:
Got in a mild car crash went to this urgent care for a checkup to see how bad I was injured. The wait was 5hours and the doctor mocked me and acted as if the accident was my fault even though I was rear ended and was entirely not my fault. The doctor needs to do their job and help the patients not give them lectures on how to drive. They didn’t help me and tried to tell me I had an bacterial infection again like the headaches but I was in there for a car crash and I was not sick or anything. Please do not go here until they get new staff and real doctors</Text>

Best urgent Care experience ever!  Walked in on a Sunday morning and was out WITH a prescription within a half hour. Saved me so much time by not going to the pharmacy. Everyone who helped me was kind and pleasant. Five stars all the way!< /text>

<rating>1< /rating><Review>Please please please do not go here. This place allowed a nurse to try and force my 11 year old daughter to take a shot in a different area then the doctor told her. When my husband advised the nurse to do the shot in the butt like the doctor said, the nurse started yelling at my daughter to turn around and was going to give my daughter the shot in the butt forced my daughter pants down as my child scream stop please don't. My husband had to to tell her stop and get up to my child as she then yelled at my child no sit down I'm going to give you this shot. Mind you she was there for a horrible migraine and now my daughter is traumatized. When tried to tell the doctor about what happen he didn't want to believe a patients word over his staff and now my daughter is traumatized. Please go to any other urgent care this chain is horrible.

This place is the worst, I take my 4 year ols daughter very sick with  high temperature, while we were waiting my daughter started vomiting so i ask the lady at the front desk if she have a little container that my daughter can use, the lady roll her eyes and make a yuck face because my daughter was vomiting so she get up of her desk and instead of give me a container or a tissue to clean my daughter she send another guy to give me wipes to clean the floor, so I ask him are you giving me this to clean my daughter? I know that those wipes are not mean for skin contact and he said not, to clean the floor, ......Really?? They were more concerned about their floor than give me something for my daughter and the lady on the desk was behind the desk making those yuck faces, they are very unprofessional if they don't like their job they should go and find another job that they actually can really handle.< /Text>

<review>This is the worst place you can ever come to. Today I came here because I wanted to check my throat ( I usually get infections) and a strange cut in my tongue that appeared. So I let the nurse know my symptoms, when the Physical assistant came, his name was john Olson, he checked my throat and he didn't mentioned anything about my tongue, so I kindly asked about the cut in my tongue, he got so angry and shouted at me, telling me that I can be seen for one thing only. Then he told me to get out, because he had many more people to see, although I was the first patient in the clinic. It angers me that these so called "urgent care" are in business just to charge the insurance and not to help patients.  This is not my first time here, and every time I have an unpleasant experience. I will NEVER come here again. If I could give this zero stars I would but the computer would not allow it.< /review>< Name>

<review>Terrible experience here. A complete waste of time and money. When I saw the "physician", I was surprised at the lack of compassion exhibited. I did inform her that I am also a health care professional, a registered nurse, mistakenly thinking that she would stop her condescending remarks and patronizing attitude. I thought that perhaps along with my credentials, she would consider my advanced age reason to give my complaint credence. She was rude and dismissive. Arriving home, I telephoned the facility to get her name and was told she is a PA. Is it even legal to refer to her as a physician? Although I'm really annoyed that I wasted my time tonight and have to find the time tomorrow to see a Dr., I am relieved that she doesn't have an MD after her name. Very poor assessment skills. Very poor communication skills. No compassion at all. Don't expect professional care here, especially seeing Anna Rios.</review>< Rating>

Did not culture my mothers wound and gave wrong antibiotic. Also prescribed my mom and antibiotic she was allergic to even after they were told she had the allergy. Not surprisingly after 2 days on the wrong antibiotic that she was allergic to she developed low blood pressure and back pain along with cellulitis. When she went back to get reevaluated she was ridiculed and made to feel stupid. Did not acknowledge the worsening infection  or her low bloop pressure. Told to go home and let the antibiotic do there job. After another 2 days mom stopped getting out of bed. Took her back again this time was told she needed IV antibiotics and was sent to the ER. She went through renal failure because of the drug allergy and ended up in the ICU. They had to give her a lot of fluid to bring her kidneys back from failure and then she went into respiratory distress and is now on a ventilator and breathing off a machine. She has developed pneumonia and bronchitis. This was our first and last experience with this urgent care facility. I would never go back and I will never recommend anyone to go there.</Text>

This place is junk.  If I could give it zero stars I would.  The receptionist is rude and incompetent.  Apparently the way medical care works is, if they(the urgent care staff) don't know how to verify your insurance then you have to pay up front...wonderful just like TJ.  While there I overhead one of the workers speaking rudely over the phone to somebody looking for medical care.  Until this "urgent" care replaces the front staff go elsewhere.</text>

I went here a year and a half ago for a radial fracture. While they were nice enough to mold a splint for it, the nurse either didn't have an ounce of good sense, or may have just been plain malicious. She kept insisting that I straighten my arm for the X-ray. My BROKEN arm. And the doctor wasn't 100% certain that it was an actual fracture, so he said they would send the X-rays into orthopedic and they would get back to me. Which never happened. No calls, no mail. But they sure as hell billed me for it. They swore up and down that the 20 dollar copay was all we would have to pay. To my surprise, we got a bill for 400 dollars four months later. After settling that a long while ago, I got another bill from a collections agency just the other day for 180. Which apparently accrued 20 dollars interest before I ever heard about it. I feel scammed.<//Text>

I came here due to an infection, I literary told  the physical assistance to do a strep test, you know the one with the swab in throat to check if it is infection or not. I was having a nasty pain, could not even drink water, he came and said strep was positive and prescribed some antibiotics. A week later I was feeling worst even though  I finished the medicine as prescribed, I went back and explained my situation (nurse was doubting my story ,thinking I missed days on meds or did not follow directions) but after explaining my self again he gave me another dose of a different antibiotics, I took the meds and it did nothing, I was feeling so sick! I finally managed to make a doctor appointment with a real doctor somewhere else, I explained my case I even took the empty bottles of antibiotics I took. He couldn't believe they prescribed those meds! he finally gave me a new antibiotics and after second day I was feeling much better. This urgent clinic doesn't have knowledgeable doctors. Just assistants that don"t know what they are doing, very rude. They are playing with people's health! Do not take he risk of coming here if you think you have something serious. Will NEVER come here again!</Text>

< review>
My wife hurt her knee badly this morning at the gym. Progressively thru the day her pain got excruciating. I told her I would leave early from work and meet her at this urgent care. I called the office on the way and tried to find out what they could do as far as examination and pain killers if needed . I was asked by the girl who answered the phone, how my wife's injury had happened. I explained that she had twisted it at her boot camp w trainer. I hung up and got to the urgent care 40 min later. When I arrived I was told by "Marie", the desk girl , "that my story didn't match up to my wifes" . I said "what do you mean?" She said that my wife had called in before she got there and said told Marie over the phone ,that she hurt it at work . I told Marie ,with my wife right there , that my wife never called in ,and that I was the only one who called. Marie insisted that she had a conversation with my wife before she came in . She basically called us liars in the waiting room. She then proceed to tell us that they wouldn't see/treat us . These people are morons. I told them her personal trainer could vouch for the injury from the gym, but they insisted they would not help us. Don't ever go here unless you want to experience the worst in the medical field.<//review>

<review>Prior, I had wonderful experiences here. That is why I give 2 stars still. SItha is a very efficient PA, but the front desk staff is so rude, and not to say the NP we saw today! The filipino woman at the front and the NP Valerie have very bad customer service to the point where it is offensive. Why are they even working there if they are so unhappy and bitter with their job and the patients! This time, The NP Valerie was on staff, not Sitha. We waited 3-4 hours to get seen and had to have my mom bring ibuprofen for my son as he waited in the lobby to get his fever down. When NP Valerie came in the room after being there 4 hours TOTAL, she was very rude and did not even apologize for her EXTREMELY slow service. Also totally did not aknowledge me as a mom and told my young sick son, "I am not asking her I am asking you." I am his mother and I am the caring for him! How rude of her! All she did was intimidate him. Then took forever to diagnose him. Now I know why we waited so long!  On top of that, It took about 6 days to get a strep throat result. They never called, until I called mutiple times and then they called me back with a positive test result. I am so dissapointed at this A plus urgent care. Who ever owns this place needs to hire friendlier, efficient staff and also have immediate strep test results like many other urgent cares. My son could have been cured long ago, not fever for a week, if he was properly diagnosed the first time around. A proper diagnosis needs efficient lab tests and staff on site. Whoever owns this establishment needs to address these concerns ASAP AND hire people who actually enjoy their high paying jobs. They are not doing it for free! I am so dissapointed, and foremost, feel bad for my sick son. After 9 years of  loyalty of using this as my number one choice of urgent care, I can say I will not be coming here ever again!<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<text>Worst place to go if your sick! My wife went there for problems coughing and breathing with a sore throat and the physicians assistant (never see a real doctor there) told her that her lungs sound amazing and nothing in her chest xray. We took her to the hospital immediately after because he sounded like a idiot and sure enough she had very bad bronchitis with pneumonia starting (exact same stuff done, listened to her lungs and chest xray).. Please save yourself two hours of waiting for wrong/terrible diagnoses. Will NEVER return here again!</text>< pics>

<Review>I took my daughter for c/o fever x48 hrs. Spiked her temp up to 103.5 F. I knew what's going on but I do not want to ignore her symptoms. The PA (last name, Pios) was lack of professionalism and the worst bedside manner I have ever encounter. I let her act like a high and mighty, but I know, she knows nothing on how to take care of human beings. Shame on her, she should not be in this profession. On the other hand, i just want to commend the XRAY tech/Health tech, he was very helpful.</Review>< pictures>

1st Visit was O.K.  (defiantly slow service but close to home)  Could be 3 stars ***

Follow up was another story. Rude and inconsiderate to my needs!!!  They will not take any accountability for there actions (or lack there of). Prescriptions sent to the wrong place and that place never received them. Oh thats my fault, Ill do better to follow up on their job...

I give it NO stars overall !!!</Text>

Dr. Shubhangi Deshmukh was very rude to me and my son. She was being extremely rude and callous because we checked in at 7:30pm and they close at 8pm. She said that I was very inconsiderate because I did not come in sooner. She assumed I came in late on purpose!  Well I'm sorry to say Dr. but I also work late and barely had time to make it in with my son. I am so sorry I made you stay later than you needed! I'll make sure to go somewhere else from now on.</Text>

< Review>
I've been here several times over the past few years.  Always had good experience with the doctors.  Yes the wait can be long at times but that is to be expected from most urgent care places.  I just tried their new online check in system (need to use a computer to access.  I couldn't get it to work via phone) Checked in online and waited 90 mins at home (nice!) System sent updates every 30 mins or so. After they texted me, only waited about 15 mins in office.  Totally worth it!<//Review>

It's listed as closing at 9 p.m. and they even have signs saying the same thing. But they close at 8 or whatever time they want. This used to be a really nice store with fresh meat and vegetetables. Not anymore, since it was sold,  the new owners are bring it to the ground. Wish I could give less than half a star<//text>

<text>Gosh, this place is legit. Watermelon agua fresca is on POINT. Mint lemonade although is tasty, is too tart, so it really made my stomach hurt a LOT due to the acid. My friend helped me out by drinking half of the lemonade and then we filled the rest with watermelon agua fresca and it was DELICIOUS.<//text><user_name>Victor Bennett</user_name>< pics>

Good selection,  great prices, but if you're purchasing anything they have stocked in the warehouse be prepared to spend a while there while they pull it. Also parking here is impossible</review>

(Translated by Google) It bothers me a lot that they require a mask to enter, and the girl who attends, is the only one who does not wear a mask, what does she think? Because the pattern that is there allows it? How stupid all of them.

Me molesta mucho que exijan cubreboca para entrar, y la muchacha que atiende, es la única que no usa mascarilla, que se cree ella? Porque el patrón q esta ahí lo permite? Q estúpidos todos ellos.<//Text>

<rate>4</rate><Text>Great location easy access friendly service. I am not a big fan of the nde menu screens having to order by touching a screen takes much longer and it is much harder to ask for special orders like no pickles or onions but extra ketchup and no mustard.  At Burger King you have it your way. The restrooms were cleaning and the tables to eat were clean. The drive thru had a long line that wrapped around the building and made parking a pain getting in a spot and out of a spot. The food was made correctly and was hot and fresh.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

<review>McDonald's sometimes is a funny place to go to. I want to win last week they had a nice size building but a really small parking lot. Way too small and narrow. This one here had a nice size parking lot but a teeny weeny little itty bitty building. Funny.<//review></record>

This is a totally normal McDonalds.  It is small and a bit old but the bathroom is fine.  I really only gave it three stars because it is in Arvin.  You wont find anything in Arvin of note except the excellent Police officers.< /text>

They're very rude & always get my orders wrong .  I always have to repeat my self 3 or 4 times on the drive-thru speaker and they still manage to mess up my order. & They still have the audacity to give me attitude when I tell them to correct my order .Workers seem very annoyed all the time and there shakes are always watery . I understand it can be very annoying working there but no one has them there by force so they should start acting decent.<//review>

This time we got two large combos they forgot to give us the bbq sauce on one order and then gave us one large and one medium fry.
The workers were having a conversation with someone parked in the waiting space I was supposed to be in and when I honked and asked where I should park I got ignored while she kept talking to them. Ridiculous

One of the grossest McDonald's or fast food restaurants I've been in.  The staff is rude and insisted on mopping the floor under our table while we were eating.  Will never stop here again.<//review>

I wish I could give no stars I went up to pick up my mobile order and the guy had to “verify” I was the person who ordered by having me repeat my entire order??? Is it because I’m brown you’re mexican too my dude I would literally reach for the bag of MY food that I PAYED FOR and he would not hand it over. Literally profiling me for some McDonald’s. I have the app on my phone I’m literally there every 2 weeks probably, it was embarrassing and humiliating honestly.< /Review>

<review>Stopped by on the way to visit some friends. This is probably the 2nd or 3rd time we have been here. Doesn't compare to most other McDonald's. It's very very small, consequently typically packed.< /review>< Time>

(Translated by Google) I like his service but I have points against his lack of common sense. Well, employees comply with the orders of distancing in these delicate moments, however, both management and the rest of the employees do not take measures regarding the use of masks and gloves, as I believe that any risk would be reduced much more with the use of these than with keeping a few inches away. I hope and take these types of measures since I find myself day by day seeing how other establishments meet these expectations and I am very surprised to see that MCDONALDS does not take into account these delicate issues.

Me agrada su servicio pero tengo puntos en contra respecto a su falta de sentido comun. Pues los empleados acatan bien las ordenes de distanciamiento en estos momentos delicados sin embargo tanto a la gerencia como al resto de los empleados no toman medidas respecto al uso de mascarillas y guantes pues creo que cualquier riesgo se reduciria mucho mas con el uso de estos mismos que con el guardar unas pulgadas de distancia. Espero y tomen este tipo de medidas puesto que me encuentro dia a dia viendo como otros establecimientos si cumples estas espectativas y me sorprendo mucho al ver que MCDONALDS no tome en cuenta estos delicados asuntos.</Text>
