Everything that I tried was flavorful. On top of having some of the best poke in San Diego they have some bomb bao buns that perfectly complemented my meal. I will definitely be back and I can’t wait to try more of the signature bowls and build my own!< /Review>< UserId.>

I’ve been on the hunt recently for a good San Diego Poke bowl. After a recent disappointment where I tossed half my bowl, I wanted to redeem the search!

This place is simple. They have a set menu of poke bowl options, so I chose traditional. The poke was fresh (tho diced a bit large for my taste). The avocado was good (but had some brown spots).  It also came with seaweed salad (yummy). But...no sauce at all! Is this usual? My friend and I got one small container of soy sauce for both of us and three siracha packets to share.

It was a good, fresh poke bowl— but a little too simple. I prefer to have a few more toppings and the fish a bit more bite sized.< /Text>

<name>Casey West<//name><text>This place is phenomenal. Fresh fish, crispy greens and the staff is very helpful and welcoming. The lady with the English accent is very attentive and asked how everything was every time we're there. I've been to about 10 different poke places around San Diego and this is my favorite spot.<//text>< pictures>

They only have set orders so you can't customize your bowl.  Still tasty, just wish it was a little more modular< /text>

Friendly staff that thinks ahead about the clients taste and what they are looking for in a poke bowl. I had a dish that I should have paid 25 plus for but walked away spending 10.

Nestled in a quite shopping center in Pacific beach, it's a great escape from the hustle and bustle of the main drag and offers delicious brews and Boochcraft.<//Text>< Pics>

$15 for a small poke bowl is a bit much. They charge extra for almost all toppings and put way too much sauce on. Small inside with 4 tables outside facing the parking lot (beware of flies). Wouldn't recommend. Wasn't that tasty</Review>

At first I was not sure what to expect because I usually go to the same poke spots, but once I took a bite of the seafood I was sold. The spicy tune was incredibly fresh and with the added sriracha, I my was the perfect level of spice. I went for dinner but would love to go back and make my own bowl! Oh and the Bao Buns are necessary!!!</Review>

One of the best spots in SD for poke. Everything was so fresh and the portion size was incredible. Not too heavy and a great quick bite! Kombucha on tap is a must!!! Such a great addition to a restaurant, especially a quick dine in like good time. Definitely check this spot out!!! Cali bowl was amazing.</text>

Went in for a late dinner. Ordered the salmon belly bowl. Outstanding!  Outside dining only. Music was a bit loud for my taste. Small place in a strip mall with tight parking.<//Text>

I got the Crispy Shrimp Poke. For $14 not a good deal, nor good food. A lot of plain white rice and cocktail sauce... The place generally has a good attire and seems to be on the healthy side, but the dish told a different story</Review>

More food selections and a delicious menu. The tiki drinks are EXCELLENT, and it's not a cheap night, but it's worth a visit.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< time>

This is for a visit this past summer, but when something sticks with you then you know it is good. My day getting into Pacific Beach was less than stellar and involved a lack of coffee and breakfast. So I started off behind schedule and grumpy. Decided on an early lunch as I had graduated to hangry and had my life flash before my eyes when another driver drove the wrong way in my lane to get to where they wanted to be a little faster.  So I pull into this little place hangry and shook up and I'm beyond hope for ordering. I explain what happened and just ask them to make something they'd like, not too spicy. WOW! I may have to try that more often. It was perfect. So good in fact that when I was back in that area the following week it was my place to go for lunch that day too. I didn't know what I'd eaten the time before, but I picked some things I wanted to eat and described some of what I had the week before and had another winning dish. Will definitely be visiting the next time I'm headed to PB.</review>

Aloha 🌺 We started out by having poke bowls at @goodtimepoke (the vegetarian poke bowl I had was incredibly flavorful🤤) As we ate we watched people in Hawaiian shirts wandering around trying to figure out where the entrance was to @thegrassskirtsd (which we got a bit of a kick out of😆) The truth is, the entrance to the Grass Skirt is the big metal freezer door in Good Time Poke! So once we finished our food we joined the party in The Grass Skirt for some fun cocktails🍹 10/10 would recommend< /text>

<text>We came here on our last day in San Diego. We were walking along Pacific Beach boardwalk around noon time and was craving for some poke bowl. When we got there, we decided to create our own bowl to go. Sadly, octopus was already sold out within one hour of opening. It wasn't even busy there either. We found it really weird. Anyways, food was okay and wish they had put more sauce. There was barely any but we didn't know until we left the area. I definitely had better poke bowls. I give them a three because it wasn't bad... but it wasn't great either... Unfortunately, this wouldn't be on my recommendation list.</text>< Pics>

I live Poke. This place didn’t impress me much. I prefer my poke without a lot of dressing - this place has the dressing already mixed in w the poke. It was just ok. Small take out place w a few tables. Nothing fancy< /Text>

Didn't have the build your own bowl. And had a large up-charge for a simple replacement on one of their proteins.</Text>

Very fresh ingredients and prepared with care. Clean interior and you can see what goes on in the kitchen, which is always a plus.
Portion size is smaller than other poke places (and there are tons of them nowadays). The Signature bowls are smaller servings than the Build your own and are more expensive, therefore not a good deal. I ordered the "Rub my Belly" (with torched salmon belly) for $15 and it had 3 ingredients - salmon, rice and avocado. Friends built their own and had much more food for less money.
Anyway, place is good, fresh and clean so I can recommend it with clear conscience.< /text>

Ordered a veggie patty sandwich with avocado on postmates. When I got the sandwich it had no veggie patty and no avocado. Ordered another sandwich 2 days later with avocado... again no avocado... what do I have to do to get avocado on a sandwich ? Call and make sure you put it on??</Review>

<Text>if this had half of a star i would rate it so.
I order 2 foot long and they had the promotion of buy 2 foot long and get one free and the manager never mentioned anything about the promotion, until i saw the sign on my way out I asked him and he said, sorry i already charged you, i cant do anything about it. That was his fault that he Didnt mentioned anything to me before changing me.
So, i will NEVER go back again!!!!</Text>< Rating>

ORDERD 3 sandwiches online I was there when she was making them u told her that it was my order and no sauce on all of them she must of woke up on the wrong side if the bed  with attatute she told I will fallow the order paper and she added the Vinigrette on one of the sandwich I had raise my voice by telling fo not add the sause.
On top of it I asked the extra bread to be taken out and it has not been that.
I'm not asking much the whole idea is for the to make sandwiches the way you like them.< /text>

The worker is scared to put tuna on my sandwich. He says everything is extra and It didn’t taste anything like a sandwich. It didn’t taste like tuna but it tasted like dead pickles. I forgot to take a picture of the joke sandwich and I am sure it earned to be the worst sandwich in the world and it should be written in the Guinness World Record book . I’m not even going to talk about the onions. Skinniest sandwich I have ever eaten.</review>

<text>There are a bunch of kids fooling around and too busy to pay attention to make your sandwich. After getting home, I realized they gave me the wrong sandwich and had switched it with another person. I wasn't happy.<//text>< pictures>

<rate>5<//rate><review>When I was introduced to SLD I was not working. This is group of people of such high values and integrity, they are all about helping people and their family's.
I'm most impressed with the leadership of this company, the education you receive that enables you to help yourself and others in my opinion is unmatched. When I agreed to meet with SLD I was educated on finances, how money grows and get taxed.
When SLD did and FNA (Financial Needs Analysis) on me and my family, I was able to receive the benefits that fit our budget.
Thank you SLD!</review>< pictures>

I have the opportunity to work with SLD Financial. Knowing this company only works with Grade A reportable companies, while having personal exposure to work hand-in-hand with those companies; I can only say good things about it. Having the ability to be an independent agent, after going through protocols of finger printing and background checks, I am confident and proud to be part of this business and industry.</text>

<user_name>Mike Vincent<//user_name><review>During my time with SLD I have found them to be a very professional organization. This has been the case both as a client and as an associate. They give people who may not know how to prepare for their financial future  the knowledge to do so. It is done in a professional and caring manner. I have never felt as though I was talked down to and have always felt that the people I worked with cared for me as a person. We are encouraged to pursue our goals no matter how big or small. The amount of training has been incredible. The training has covered a wide variety of topics including leadership principals, organization concepts, and product knowledge. The back office team here at SLD is second to none! Any support we need is provided by the back office team. Each time I have had to request any kind of assistance has been handled quickly. The leadership here is top notch. Probably the best group I have ever worked with.</review><Rating>5</Rating>< Time>

SLD Financial has been an absolute blessing. The quality, character, and the integrity of the individuals in this organization has impressed me more than anything I've experienced in my lifetime. The crusade and mission is real, and I'm proud to be a part of an organization that puts people as a priority before any commission. Ensuring that we educate families & businesses to better enable them to make solid decisions about their finances and futures is something that makes me proud. They educate, train, and mentor individuals that are committed to the crusade and help develop individuals to not only become better leaders but better human beings.<//Review>

The training, support, retraining, motivation, support amongst the trainers & other agents, the variety of topics covered during the training & lastly the participation of Jennifer & Jose is paramount to what I have seen in the past. That is coming from someone that thought that had decent training! 👍
The definition of a Spartan is truly carried out with everything that SLD does & the Crusade is why anyone coming into SLD & already part of SLD should feel blessed to be a part of the Spartan family!
Hats off to the creators of the SLD system, they are cultivating professional, knowledgeable winners who will carry on their legacy & follow the system to create others for many generations to follow!< /Text><resp>None< /resp><Pics>None</Pics>< rate>

<date>1605749377208</date><Rate>5<//Rate><text>SLD Financial is a great organization to work with. It is a financial firm who works on behalf of the people - the working class of America. I like the company because we reveal to people the choices they never learned about regarding their finances impacting their future.

While being at SLD, you learn to rely on yourself for your success. It is literally whatever you make of it. Even though there are trainings everyday with the company’s chairmen and directors - the real training, the crucial training takes place in your own time. Training can take anywhere between a couple weeks to several months - you move as fast you want to. It is your responsibility to take care of whatever is required of you on your own time. Your mentor/trainer is not your boss but your guidance counselor. They are there to lead you to the next stage of the goal(s) YOU set for yourself - ONLY IF you allow them. No quotas for the company, no grueling hours set by the company - you work as much or as little as you like. Once you have done all that is required in training, then you can proceed with helping families who request your expertise on improving their lives through financial literacy.

I really have no complaints with the firm except I wish I would have acted faster and took it seriously immediately once I joined the company.< /text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x80dce7d559f578ef:0x8e5d582bf508c4e2</GmapID></record>

<text>The amount of support providing by this company is amazing!  Looking for a different career path at a mature age isn't easy.  Don't get me wrong, there's plenty of other opportunities out there but you tend to be a bit more selective of who you want to work for, what type of environment you want to be in, get paid your worth, and most importantly, you want to make a difference in what you do.  SLD Financial provided all of the above.  I wish I knew then what I know now, my financial situation would be in much better order and I would be well prepared for retirement.

If you are open to a new career path, enjoy helping others, and want to make a NICE income along the way, contact SLD Financial and set up an interview appointment.  You will not be disappointed :0)<//text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x80dce7d559f578ef:0x8e5d582bf508c4e2</Gmap_id></record>

One day, I received a text from a lady named Rosa about wanting to interview me as she received my resume of of a career builder. I scheduled the interview I was in interviewed by Angie Zafra, who become my mentor.

I had been looking for a job opportunity that allowed me and the flexibility to work when wanted to so that I could be around my family more often. I am a personal injury attorney who was working 80-90 hrs. a week and did not spend a lot of time with my wife and my two little girls.

I took this opportunity on not knowing much about finances, however I was trained in the business by the best, and ever since I joined I have absolutely loved it. I love people I work with, the clients I help, and the financial education that I have received.

Although I have found this later in life, and this is my second career, this the best thing that has ever happened to me in my adult working life.  I say this
from the bottom of my heart, thank you Angie, Jennifer, and Jose for giving me this wonderful opportunity to be part of this wonderful organization.< /Text>

This company has been an amazing opportunity, the financial education that is offered by it’s directors and Associates is unlike any other financial firm out there. Always offers simple solutions to clients financial needs. They  are very friendly, professional, and always have a servitude attitude. If you are in need of some financial education, or just simply have questions they are always there to help.< /Review>

SLD is a unique Financial firm; that is, they do not sell you anything you do not need; rather listen to you and find out what is best for you. I was listened to and solutions to my unique issues were provided and they did not even charge for it. The brokerage house I was at before charged me $1,500 for a sit down to do a financial needs analysis, SLD did it for free and it was better and more detailed. Also, they have retirement accounts that do not lose money; really! If I had that in 08, I would not have lost most of my portfolio. I cannot recommend a brokerage house higher than SLD. Caring, knowledgeable, professional, thorough, and they have the products others do not have. They will not overcharge you or lose your money.  And save yourself $1,000 and attend their webinars; what the financial gurus change, SLD is free, better, and more updated information.</review>

Since coming to SLD, I have found the freedom I never had in the many years of working for corporate America. SLD is providing me the training, one-on-one mentoring and opportunities I can not find anywhere else. As an independent agent of this independent brokerage, I am in business for myself, but not by myself, because my mentors, trainers and teammates are always there to help and support me. The commitment and passion for helping people is unprecedented. I could not have found a better professional family to align with.</text>

<review>SLD is no ordinary financial firm. This is the one place where the client truly comes first. They are so professional, genuine, knowledgeable, and patient.  They take their time and actually cared about what I was going thru, what I wanted, and needed.   I had no life insurance and I had no job so I needed something affordable to protect my family.  Now I am covered and I have a peace of mind.  Where can one go to get financial advice for FREE?  SLD is who I suggest!< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80dce7d559f578ef:0x8e5d582bf508c4e2<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>
<text>I love their energy! Makes everyone feel welcome! I applied to become part of the spartan family and everything went great, but I didn't have my license. They have classes to prepare you to get your license but you have to be available on their time and with my full time job I wasnt able to take the classes. I wish they were more open to people that are trying to become part of the family but other than that, they have an awesome team!< /text>< Resp>

The past few months have been extremely pleasing for me with the ongoing level of training  / preparation provided.

General session training was awesome today. It's great that SLD management recognized the need and delivered a beginning to end set of certifications for newcomers to more readily grasp understanding of acronyms and their meanings, appropriate verbiage for the industry, how to gain promotions and appointments, etc.

The officers, administrative staff, directors, trainers are all exceptional. Kudos to all of you!

I like the overall company culture. The entire leadership team uphold high standards on ethics and doing only what's right for the client. Everyone is glad to help each other and will uplift each other to succeed. It invest in a significant amount of time on training individuals to be leaders, business owners, and financial professionals. I never have to worry about compromising my values here because abiding by high core values is key  here.</text>

Great company and great people. I learn a lot every day with SLD training on Zoom and the personal touch with my trainer Diane Laizure.
Can’t believe what opportunities are available for helping people with their finances and retirement, also the possibilities for moving up in the company and creating my own business and earning money to reach all my goals and dreams.<//Text>

It’s a great business...the process takes time, commitment, and willingness to persevere. SLD has been very helpful in teaching financial literacy and getting the right accounts in place so my family is covered if something happens to me. Thanks SLD<//text>

Im loving, the opportunity to train for a new career in business, with the most kind, caring, and inspirational team members I've ever met. I think their educational expertise is on point, and they're constantly striving for consistent improvement for their team members, and their business. So blessed and thankful to have been given such a great opportunity. Thank you SLD CEO's, directors, associates,  and Team leaders for a great start to a better future, in helping others.< /Review>

<Review>SLD Spartan is the type of organization that you do not need to have a decade of experience as a financial advisor. No matter what type of background you have or even fresh out of high school, SLD provides the training to be successful. All you need to bring to the table is your commitment..</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Financial consulting and educating clients is top notch.  Helping families find financial solutions while giving them information to make the best choices for their families and future.  I have personally learned more than I've ever known before and the advisors are extremely supportive.< /Text>

<text>I interviewed with other companies both before and after interviewing with SLD. My interviewer was Diane Laizure and I knew in my heart and gut that THIS was the company I wanted to lock arms with.  Every zoom call I’ve been on has been professional, informative and in my humble opinion is very different (in a very good way) by leaps and bounds and in sooo excited to finally be able to work with this company!

The whole process from buying to the delivery and setup was good, and he even sold us on an adjustable bed frame. Only thing keeping this from being a 5 star is that when they were setting up the bed frame, they didn’t put on the headboard bracket. Not the end of the world, I’ll just have to do it later.</Review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x80832885a08c2077:0x64c15cae7f39fa04< /gmap_id></record>

After sleeping on a waterbed for over 40 years we decided it was time to look for a new mattress after our good old waterbed mattress began to leak! After reading the reviews of several stores we decided to try Mattress Firm on Forest Avenue. We're so glad we did! Ryan was so helpful and really seemed to have the knowledge of the products we were looking for. We  didn't feel pressured at all and would highly recommend  Mattress Firm to anyone looking for a good quality mattress! Thanks again, Ryan!</text>

Mattress Firm on Forrest Ave. , Chico was great at letting us try out the mattresses while still being very safe and hygienic! The process was easy, painless, and everyone was very hospitable; we were even offered water while we waited to check out! We are in the middle of moving and they happily accommodated our needs. Grateful for the experience and stoked to get our new mattress!!< /review>

Excellent customer service! Very transparent very honest very helpful! I believe the gentleman helping me was named Ryan and not only did he have a great banter but he was extremely helpful for my first time buying a bed and a mattress. I had the best experience and I would recommend to anybody!<//Text>

I had the great pleasure of Speaking with Ryan today.  I had an unusual problem, but that did not slow Ryan down.  He listened to my problems with concern.  After a short pause, Ryan offered me several opptions according to my budget.  This was a huge help to me. After shopping around on the phone and internet, I was very relieved to receive Ryan's help.  Ryan was able to get me a great mattress at a huge savings, including set up and next day delivery.  This is not the first time that Mattress firm has helped me.  I would sujest if you want quality and a great deal, call Ryan @ Mattress firm Chico on Forest Ave.  Thank you Ryan.!<//text>

<Text>Gabe was our salesman.  Great guy. No pressure and knows what he is talking about. He was patient while we tries many beds. We went with a king then got home and decided we wanted to stay with a queen for various reasons.  I called and he helped us switch our decision with no problems at all.  I would recommend anyone looking for a new bed to go see Gabe. Thank you Gabe at the Chico Mattress Firm Forrest Ave location.</Text><gmapID>0x80832885a08c2077:0x64c15cae7f39fa04</gmapID></record>

<Text>I’m quite happy with the bed I purchased recently. The only reason I gave one less star was because when I was trying to decide the bed I wanted, the sale lady at night who was there said I was really picky. I understand she might have been tired because I was having trouble deciding, but then again, buying a bed is kind of a big deal. After all, it is something you’ll be using everyday. You better make sure you’re happy and comfortable.< /Text>< name>

Great job by Ryan for setting us up.  He did all the right things, was attentive, knew his products well, answered our questions--but then did what every good sales person should do, gave us the space and time to make a decision.  Solid job and great service.  The new bed technology has improved and is worth a look.< /Text>

WOW!  Scott is one of the best sales people I've ever met.  He truly cares about his clients & wants the best for them, NOT the best sale in his pocket.  I was blown away by how kind, GENUINE, knowledgable, generous, & happy he was!  I have been in customer service for 10 years & I've never had such great service!!  Sit N Sleep is so lucky to have him as an employee.  I will go back everytime to see him & recommend him to anyone looking for new bedding.  THANK YOU SCOTT!!</Review>

Although my family and I only had a short experience there as we knew exactly what we wanted we had an excellent experience with there customer service. Particularly Ryan was a great help and his charisma and personality made the process a truly wonderful, and simplistic process. If I ever am needing/looking for a mattress I would definitely return here, and recommend this place to anyone who is searching or in need of a mattress!< /Text>

Place so nice I'll review it twice, first yelp, now Google! Anyways, I can't believe they're still open! Shelter-in-place has me spending a lot of time on my bed and I didn't realize just how uncomfortable I was. I was really anxious about spending too much money on a quality mattress but they have a massive selection. I did end up choosing a bed a little higher priced than I was planning on, but their financing options were really inclusive. Even with my college loans and old medical bills, I got approved for the bed I fell in love with. The guys who work here are super informative, so I feel like I really know what I'm buying - PLUS all of the sanitization efforts in the store made me comfortable in the location itself. Thanks Ryan and Gabe, I can't wait to get my bed later this week - so much sooner than I was expecting!< /review>

<Review>I'm moving away from home for the first time and while spending money gives me major anxiety I wanted to treat myself to a new, comfy, decent sized bed. You know, so I can sleep away the pandemic depression and not get any class work done.
I had been looking online for mattresses, feeling anxious and hopeless, when my mum insisted we go to a store in person (wait, that's a thing?). We ended up at Mattress Firm on Forest Ave, which is basically a nap haven with a large selection of beds to try and choose from. The sales associate, Joshua Dybdahl, was very helpful in finding me a mattress that wouldn't break my back or my bank account (actually it's the most comfortable thing ever and can't wait for it to be delivered).
Josh was also very patient with my mum who indulges in conversation whenever she can (few and far between these days), so as far as I'm concerned he deserves a raise. Or at least... a new mattress?
I left the store feeling confident that I had gotten a great deal, excited to have a queen size memory foam mattress (plus box spring and mattress cover), and grateful that my mum and all her eccentricities had been treated with kindness and charm.

<Review>I would like to start with what an amazing experience we had. Steve was nice, attentive, patient, and understanding. He was able to help us out perfectly and wasn’t trying to sell us the most expensive or fancy anything. He wanted us to choose the bed we found the most comfortable, affordable and reliable. We didn’t have a whole lot of room to work with at home and he was able solve every problem we had. Thank you again! And we will send anyone who needs a bed to Mattress Firm.</Review>< user_name>

<text>Stopped in here to try out different mattresses in preparation of getting a new one and Steve was awesome at explaining the different types of mattresses and varying levels of support. Ended up walking out with a great mattress and I couldn't be happier. Go see Steve, you won't regret it.< /text><Time>1569638866399<//Time><UserId.>116813777961323663454< /UserId.>< Rate>

I bought 2 beds from mattress Firm today, I was really pleased with the selection but better yet the service was outstanding! Our salesperson Steve was very knowledgeable about all there products and was genuinely concerned about us getting the best beds for what our needs are and staying inside of our budget.  I'd recommend this store to anyone looking for a new bed! Thanks Steve!</Review>

<Review>From sales, to phone support, to delivery, mattress firm was professional, courteous,  and they kept their promise of delivery exceeding my expectations each step. I was told originally the mattress would be delivered within 3 days and they kept to their promise. The mattress they delivered was even more comfortable than what I had tried out in the store. Delivery was the most professional I had ever experienced. I will definitely be doing business with them again and will be telling all my friends and family of the exceptional experience I had. Thank you Matress Firm!<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

After going through a terrible time like many others just like us, the rebuilding and refurnishing process sometimes is a bit scary. Walking into Mattress Firm today and being greeted by Steve set our tone off right from the start. Steve was knowledgeable and helpful no matter how many questions or concerns myself or my grandmother had. He made the process easy and pain free. He truly made a customer for life! I highly recommend going to this location for any of your mattress needs! Thank you again, Steve!</text>

I came in not knowing what to expect. However it was a great experience. All staff members were very helpful and there was no pressure on selling a mattress. They were able to find a good deal on a mattress from a different store and were able to ship it over. Definitely a place to check out if you want a new bed!< /text>

Steve is the man! He helped replace my bed and my boys' beds. I walked in, he helped me and we walked out in less than 30 min. The beds we have are affordable, comfortable and they were even delivered and set up by the company. I would never buy a bed any other way.< /review>

Best bed buying experience ever. So glad we were taken care of by Ryan, he was awesome. He mentioned he was a newer employee but I never would have guessed that. He was amazingly knowledgeable and so personable. He rocks! Thanks for spending so much time with us Ryan! Mattress firm is the place to go in Chico for bed shopping. Tons of options! Plus they have the Purple bed!<//review>

My fiance and I had the best experience at this location! Right when we walked in, we were greeted and felt very welcomed! Marilyn helped us right away and was able to help us find the perfect bed! She was able to relate to to us and we really enjoyed talking to her and having her help us with everything. She was extremely friendly and while I typically don't go for products up sold to me, because I work in retail myself, I couldn't resist with how great of a job she explained things and was so thorough, and also gave us a really great deal on everything. I would reccomend this store to anyone who is looking for a new bed set up, because while it may seem expensive at first, she went over options and set us up to finance a bed. It was WELL worth it and we got a great deal!</Text>

I just purchased a king size bed with adjustable frame from Mattress Firm. Not only do I love the bed I purchased but Steve was probably the most efficient and helpful mattress expert I’ve dealt with. I will always bring my business back to Steve on Forest Ave.< /Text>

We went in to buy new beds due to our loss in the Camp Fire. Customer Service was excellent.They delivered the beds, but only had 1 side of the Cal King box springs. Delivered that the next day. Today, I take the sheets off to each and from in between the mattress and box springs comes a tag that say" secondhand used article has been sanitized". WHAT???? I call, speak with Ryan and am informed that since I got a discount on the bed there was nothing he could do for me???? REALLY????? NO where on my receipt invoice or any of my paperwork does it say USED!!!!! Area manager is suppose to be calling me but that was almost 2 hours ago. SERIOUSLY......have we not been through enough without being scammed by a Mattress Company.</Review>

I came into the store and told them my budget and it was red carpet service from there. showed my a couple of beds, i feel in love with one, and they gave me a deal i couldnt say no too. and i didnt feel like i was being presured. Wish buying big ticketed items were always like this. this team should be recognized expecially Gabe for their amazing service and professional attitude.</Review>

A little more pricey but not by much. However well worth it. Amazing and thorough job on pedicures and manicures. Amy did an amazing job on my hands and feet. I am now going to be using this salon for now on. Best nail salon on the mountain. Very detailed and clean work and super friendly staff. Amy really took good care of me there i definitely recommend using her if she's available. Such a good experience i want to go back already<//Review>

The service here varies between 3.5 and 4.5 maybe even five star depending on when you go and who does your nails. The lady who usually does my nails did a great job the first three visits but the last two visits were less than stellar. The most recent visit she was in such a hurry to see the next client that she didn’t finish filing my nails and they were jagged and the gel didn’t even reach the end of the nail. Rather than see a different technician in front of her I opted to go to a different nail salon down the hill. That was a mistake. Based on my experience this is a good salon but making an appointment to see one of the ladies who’s already very busy is probably the best plan.< /review>

Went in for a Christmas inspired gel manicure. I was in and out in 30 minutes. Overall: Quick, friendly with attention to detail. The nail salon is bright, clean warm and inviting.

Make an appointment in advance for fastest service.</Review>

<Text>I chose one star because when it comes to giving treatments and making one feel special, they truly do a horrible job. Whenever I call to make appointments, they never take my name, so when I get there and say that I have an appointment at this time, I still have to wait another hour to get helped. They rush too much and there’s always a couple of my gel nails that doesn’t look nice. Quantity over quality with them. And I’ve been all over the world and received many mani and pedicures and I’ve even worked on cruise ships doing nails and massage before so I know a thing or two about customer service. Just because they’re busy doesn’t mean they’re great ladies and gents.<//Text><name>Laetitia Nowers<//name>< pictures>

I had a great experience. My wait was 15 minutes with an appointment but they take walk ins and closed at 4. I came in at 3pm. Michael did my nails and in the shape I wanted. He was very nice and cared about me being happy. I love them. Nice job!</Text>

I usually have this male named Tom do my acrylics! He is amazing:)) you should make a appointment before that way your service goes faster. It’s very clean and they are very welcoming! I go about every 2 weeks and I keep going back because I love that place!!</Text>

I have very ticklish feet. I used to dread getting a pedicure, and for years I just stopped going.

But Lee has the magic touch. I'm never going to be able to get over being ticklish, but she was able to scrub and massage without making me kick back - and I didn't need to drink wine this time! Finally, I have found my place.

The manicure afterwards was very well done. I have 0 complaints.

Facility is clean and comfortable - not cramped at all like other salons. I am not one to spoil myself, but I find myself adding mani-pedi's to my monthly routine.< /review>

<rate>1</rate><Review>This place is actually a joke. Worst nail salon I've EVER been to. The nail techs are so disrespectful they laugh and smirk at you. Shaped my nails terribly. Said it would be 22 dollars for a full set. I went in and they told me the nails had to be not much longer than my actual nails to be 22. Then tried to say it was 27 for coffin which is less material and work if you're doing a full set. I respectfully said I wasn't going to do a full set for 27 and would like to leave. They kept gluing the nails on after I told them to stop. I had to get loud before they would let go and stop.< /Review>< pics>

Then I got my nails done she did a horrible job at shaping my nail I kept on looking at them because one or two of my nails where not looking the same I told her and she took a very long time re-shaping and she got mad.But what I really liked is that the nails that I got lasted me a MONTH AND 2 WEEKS!!!! Which I was happy about because I
have never had any acrylic nails last me so long!< /review><Resp>None<//Resp><pics>None< /pics></record></dataset><record>

Clean and bright location with a delightful brochure. Two words: Spa pedicure. The murals on the wall were superb. Artist name? Busy location and design is offered. Bathroom was clean.

Thanks for opportunity to evaluate. Starts are easy, yet over time all things are revealed. Magazines were new and clean.  Spa chairs were functional and service is given with a capital S!

Do tip--as it helps---staff was considerate and classical music played and warm massage ensued.  Located close to the Blue Jay Post Office offering select views of the majestic Cedar trees. Thanks XVL for awesome design! Kindness is never forgotten.</Text>

<Review>My wife has been a regular here for a long time, but on more than one occasion, they take walk-ins over appointments, and then try to tell her that her appointment was on a different day. Don’t expect to get any special treatment for being a return customer. They don’t care about you. They lost my wife AND all of her friends’ business the last time they did this to her.< /Review><response>None</response><Pictures>None< /Pictures><time>1554493391399<//time><Name>Stewart Reeves<//Name></record>

This place is a joke.  Rude, never on time and poor communication, not because of language. The owner never smiles and makes you feel like your a bother. I know its the only place in local area. Regardless, I will drive off mt to get some respect and enjoy my manicure.< /review>

Always wonderful! I have a nail biting habit and they do such a good job, you can't even tell my natural nails are tiny. They're always nice and respectful with smiles on their faces. Good people, good work, good prices. I highly recommend this salon.<//text>

<Review>Tom was awesome, and did a great job on my nails.  However as I sat there for an hr while getting a set and a pedi, 3 customers came in to have their nails redone after only 4 days because they fell off.  But they were not customers of Tom's.  Tom again was great, friendly, and gentle with you fingers<//Review>< Pictures>

Didn't use clean tools and Tom is unlicensed I tried to write his license number on my hand to report him and he grabbed me by the arm and poured acetone on my hand then took all the license off the stations and put them in a drawer. As a cosmetologist I know the rules and this shop broke them all! Very dangerous unsanitary could give you infection and say it an ingrown toenail or hangnail ect. He files nails wrong so they lift and break and if you don't pay for gel when he offers he files nails hard to hurt you and acts like it was an accident. DO NOT RISK YOUR HEALTH FOR PAYING LESS !!!

<Review>I've been to this nail salon twice now. The first time, I was happy with the manicure, but not with the pedicure.  One of my feet bled slightly where the technician had scrubbed overly hard.  I then used another salon down the mountain for the next few mani-pedis.  However, because we try to buy local, I decided to try them again, since maybe the first time had just been an off day.  This time the pedicure was good, however the gel nail manicure I got was not.  The nails started to peel off after only three days.  The woman who did my gels, was looking everywhere around the salon except at my nails.  She was not precise and the nails were uneven.  I don't think I'll be going back.  However, to their credit, there were MANY happy satisfied customers there, so I know they're doing something right - just not my nails.<//Review>< Pics>

They said they could price match a battery with Walmart. Walmart had a 3 year warranty and Oreileys had a 6 month warranty. They then came back with a counter offer of 25 dollars over the price. Because they offer less of a warranty... makes no sense!<//review>

I think I have an issue with my alternator I called O’Reilly’s in gridley and they said to come in and they could test it. When I got here the employee said he couldn’t find the tester I’m not sure who’s fault that is exactly but regardless it’s unacceptable. There was another employee there as well she didn’t bother to even try to help look for it. Lazy and unprofessional in my opinion. Lazy and unprofessional in my opinion I will never come here again.</Review>

I was having trouble with my car and didn't know if it was the battery or the alternator. I took the battery in to be tested but was told they would need to charge it first and then test it to make sure it can hold a charge. I left it with them over night and went back the next day to discover that they lost my battery. They told me that the best they could do is give me a discount on a new battery. I was very upset but at the time I felt like my only options were to either go somewhere else and get a new battery at full price or get a new battery at a discounted price even though THEY were the ones that lost my battery. Turns out, my original battery was good and it was the alternator that needed replacing. I went somewhere else for the alternator and will never go back to O'Reilly's again. Watch out, they might lose your stuff and make you buy it new.</Text>

This is my troll account so please Ignore the photo and name lol. Earlier today (7/12/19) I was stuck in Gridley with a dead battery but luckily for me I was in the same parking lot as this O’Rileys. I was helped by a lady and a young man, they were both really nice about it and the guy even told me my car sounded nice! I don’t really review places much but it’s the least I could do for keeping my car on the road. I never got your name but thank you for jumping my 2017 BRZ. This is probably the best place to shop for your automotive needs around this area!</text>

Since this O'Reilly store is located in the heart of a farming community, they are used to getting odd requests for parts. I have always found that, even when ordering unusual parts, parts that need to be ordered from other stores or warehouses typically arrive the next day. I have had some entertaining experiences trying to order a replacement part and being told that the part sitting on the counter doesn't exist, but management gives employees the necessary training to ensure the correct part is provided. I have never had a part purchased at O'Reilly not fit my vehicle.< /Review>

< Review>
This is a small little bakery with Portuguese goods. It's been around since the mid 80s and I've barely discovered it just recently. Their Pastéis de Natas which are Portuguese custard tarts are so delicious!! It's almost as good as the ones from Pastéis de Belém in Lisbon, Portugal. The crust is nice and soft, a little flaky on the outside with creamy custard inside. If you like, you can also warm it up at home and add powdered sugar and cinnamon on top just like they do in Portugal. But it is really good just the way it is. I'm so glad I found this bakery, it's probably the best Pastéis de Natas I've had so far in the Bay Area. I'm also going to try other places to compare. I'll most definitely come back here for their Pastéis de Natas again. They tend to run out so I suggest calling in ahead of time to let them know you're coming in for Pastéis de Nata and they will keep some for you.

I've tried their almond and cream puff pastry and it was okay.< /Review>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><review>This place is a hidden gem. You walk in and it smells amazing! The tarts are melt in your mouth, delicate flavors that tantalize your taste buds. They have savory tarts too. The amount of imports to choose from makes for happy shopping. Also the basic goodness of Lingucia and breads. My favorite has to be the coconut tart, followed by the traditional Pastel de Natas. They package them beautifully and make excellent gifts. Do yourself a favor and stop in and treat yourself to something from this remarkable store, you will not be disappointed.
It's behind Jack in the box.</review>< Date>

Small market and bakery located behind Jack and the Box. Has all the essentials from Portuguese sausage, bacalau, cheese, bread, oil, cookies, natas, etc. Come early for natas though.  Friendly owner and helpful staff.</review>

My favorite place for especie, pasteis de nata and massa sovada. I'm closer to the Portuguese bakeries in the south bay, but these are SO WORTH the trip!

They sell out of papo secos QUICK on weekends, so be sure to call ahead if you have a big order or just get there early.

Helpful and friendly staff. They always have customers coming in and out, despite the somewhat unfavorable location.< /text>

<Review>Absolutely bad horrific scam. I have the row52 app. Saw a vehicle came in and went the next day. It only been 1 day 4hrs and the vehicle no where insight. Also came for other vehicle that came in 4 days ago no where insight. Ask the staff little to no help said it was there but it ain't. Check the hole section not he row just in case misplace but the whole section and looked and each vehicle in the section, Also the yard is a complete mess came on (Sunday) I have been to ipull-upull Stockton , Pick-n-pull San Jose, Newark, Stockton, Oakland, Richmond. All have cleaner yard and more helpful staff.<//Review>< GmapID>

Great place to find a lot of the items for repairs.
A large variety of cars and trucks to choose from. Parts are fairly priced and the personal are very friendly and helpful.  I definitely recommend this place to any mechanic, handyman or simply car user or driver.< /text>

My life partner, Jerry has been a customer of picknpull since they opened ( usually Richmond yard and occasionally Oakland).  We know their policies and haven't ever had a problem.
Jerry is a retired veteran, and has been a self- employed mechanic for a very long time.
Recently we moved to Vallejo so have been going to the Fairfield yard more. We thought we would check out the new American canyon yard.

So he ended up pulling a motor from an Impala for a client of his from this yard for $310 on 10/27. Took it home and installed it. Took the core in on 10/31 (the cashier neglected to return the original receipt of the purchase - although he didn't realize this until days later).
The motor ended up having a cracked head, so he took it back to that yard and was expecting to get the credit due him so he could find another motor to replace it but instead got told that he would get a call, which we never recieved ( this was when he realized the receipt was not in his possession anymore).
RICHMOND ALWAYS STAPLED THE ORIGINAL PURCHASE RECEIPT TO THE CORE RECEIPT -KUDOS TO RICHMOND!.
So, on the next Monday, we took the motor back (again) and asked for Sonny, the manager. And because we didn't have the original receipt ( but we had the core receipt which has a reference to the original receipt's number on it) - he said he couldn't (wouldn't, actually)do anything for Jerry!!
We put a complaint in;  another one to Schnitzer; contacted the Ethics point company; contacted 7 on your side; no response from anyone!!
THIS HELLA IRKS US!! ALL HE WANTS IS THE $280 CREDIT THAT IS RIGHTFULLY HIS!! THE CASHIER IS THE ONE AT FAULT HERE! THERE IS NO WAY TO PROVE THAT, THOUGH. SO THE CUSTOMER LOSES! SO MUCH FOR THE STATEMENTS MADE UNDER THE 'INTEGRITY' PART OF THE COMPANY POLICIES! THIS IS ONLY
REGARDING THE PICKNPULL YARD AT AMERCAN CANYON! THEY SUCK!< /text>

I purchased the 800 count puff bar and within a day it stopped working. So today I contact the location and I spoke to someone by the name of Tony a younger male as he translated my complaint to who I presume is his father. Tony told me I could come into the location to get a replace . Upon my arrival I spoke to the old guy and he stated he couldn’t issue me a refund instead insisted he could give me a new device for a fee of $10.00 . Which absolutely made no sense being that he sold a defect device to me the first time and didn’t mind charging me for his mishap. He claimed the only other thing he could do for me would be to give me free device smaller device (lessor in value) . So I said yes and tried it I inside the store and and yet another DEFECTED device!  So I refused it and asked for a full refund and was deny . Please guys be careful spending you money at this small family business the rip CUSTOMER off at the expense of their customers.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<text>I love this place! Better than any other Smoke Shop in Northridge. They sell anything you need. I smoke disposables and they have every brand and flavor ( Puff, Puff Plus, Puff Flow, Hype, Ultra Hype, Hype Max, Hype Max Flow, Ezzy, Ezzy Super, Ezzy Flow, Bang, Bang XXL, etc). Hours are from 8am-12am which is amazing so I could go before and after work!< /text><response>None< /response>< Pics>

<Text>Love this place...(happens to be next to Cosmoprof) so I tend to go to this store daily. They have exceptional customer service. I don’t smoke cigarettes anymore, but I need my little salt nicotine vape at all times. The first time I came in the owner gave me a free vape just to see how it would hit which I greatly appreciated. I also want to state that I think it’s important to support local family businesses. This family is amazing. From the son to the owner and everyone in between. Times are tough and I like to know where my money goes. I feel good that the whole family is so kind and respectful and I just want to let all of you know. It rare to have such a great experience but when it happens I make sure to write a review for others to view.
I feel the need to support our local businesses more then ever right now. I like to know what my money goes to and this store has everything and I am happy to support a local family. They have a huge selection of everything you would ever need. If they are out of stock they will order for it for you. Thank you for all your help and I can’t wait to come get my Smok Nord 2 installation set. This family made me feel important and most importantly I felt safe. ❤️< /Text>< Time>

<text>I walked in and was amazed with how much inventory there was. This smoke shop is the best in the valley and one hundred percent recommended. The store is filled up with bongs/water pipes, glass, grinders, hookahs, disposable e-cigs, cigarettes, cigars, nector collectors, wraps, kratom, you name it. The staff members were really helpful and knowledgable. The most important thing is that this store is covid safe. Staff always wear gloves and masks and there is hand sanitizer spread out around the store!<//text><resp>None</resp></record></dataset><record>

< review>
Best Smoke Shop in LA County! They have everything you need in stock for a very good price. The owner is a very good guy and he will give you an amazing deal/discount. They have every disposable you need. They have all the puff bar flavors. They also have bang, hype, ezzy, ezzy super, puff plus, etc. The store has every vape juice you need, an amazing glass section, and a very cold fridge. Best Smoke Shop and I will definitely be back!<//review>

<text>I've brought two cars here in the last few weeks and they are fast and friendly. They pointed out that my transmission fluid was low and dirty, but there was no hard sell for anything beyond the oil change I came in for. Both oil changes were $19.99, just as advertised. The owner, Rommel, is friendly and honest. I highly recommend this place.<//text>< Rating>

<text>I’ve been coming here for over 10 years now. 7 different cars. They offer a Mobil Full Synthetic Oil Change for $90 when the Lexus Dealer wants $300 and Jiffy Lube Wants $190 for the same thing, nevertheless, you’re in and out of there in about 10 mins or less! I got a busy schedule with two jobs and a 4yr old boy, so I appreciate getting in and out quickly. I’ve seen them crack open brand new bottles of Mobil Synthetic oil, so I know they’re legit.

I’ve gotten the following services here:

- Motor Flush
- Transmission Flush
- Radiator Flush
- Regular and Synthetic oil changes
- Tire plugs

And I love coming here because they:

- Fill up your tires to the appropriate tire pressure
- Clean your windshields
- And before COVID hit, they would even vacuum!

Awesome family owned business that truly cares. You get that good old American Customer Service feel that is truly hard to find nowadays.

I’m surprised to see some of those reviews because these people are really kind and honest.

Some people do not know the difference between a transmission oil change and a transmission oil flush. If your mechanic does not have a shop (like this one) with the proper equipment to flush it out, then that’s the reason why it’s so much cheaper. They’re replacing the oil instead of properly flushing out all those years of grime and then replace the oil. Your transmission oil filter needs to be flushed so that it can do it’s job.<//text>< Gmap_id>

Every Oilmen location provides great and fast service. If you see a line there's a good reason why there's always a waiting line.</Review>

Went in for a regular oil change and after a few minutes of checking out the car he immediately informed me that it's going to cost a little more due to the fact that my car requires a special oil filter. It's a Kia. He went and showed me the chart and showed me what type of filter it gets. I really appreciated him explaining it to me and I went ahead and got the oil change. Excellent customer service 👍.< /Text>

Been coming here for yrs with great experiences but last time came in for oil change, I used to have a radiator leak which has been fixed they told me I had one. I told them I didn’t need it fixed. Got the oil changed and later that day my check engine light came on, came to find out they damaged my air filter definitely ain’t coming back, all I needed was an oil change no reason for them to even touch anything else.< /review>

Friendly management as it was about 96 degrees outside today and they were offering everyone cold water bottles.

<Review>Decent lunch special from a price perspective if you're in the area. Not worthy of traveling over here.  Not the most authentic Thai food and ambiance just average. Friendly service. Would be better if lunch options offered more seafood, it's mostly meat based.< /Review>< pictures>

The food was pretty good.  The chicken curry had way more chicken than I expected but I think the coconut milk was cut with something else, broth maybe.  Whatever, it was good.  The fried rice was okay.  The restaurant itself had a funky smell, and didn’t seem overly clean.  The wait staff was friendly and fast.  I’d probably go back, but will probably look for another option.</review>

<name>Evelyn Zls<//name><Review>The food was good and a lot though I've had better Thai food. We're not used to give a percentage tip in Holland so when we didn't give enough (15% on top of the total) the response was a bit unfriendly. It was just a mistake from our side not being used to tips. The pad thai was really good.< /Review><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

Decent lunch special from a price perspective if you're in the area. Not worthy of traveling over here.  Not the most authentic Thai food and ambiance just average. Friendly service. Would be better if lunch options offered more seafood, it's mostly meat based.< /Text>

<review>Authentic Thai food experience! Price is affordable and you get a authentic Thai dinner worth every buck!

Cost you $10.95 for a Basil Pork Dish, add a $3 for a bowl of plain ice enough for one (; You also pay additional 20cents for to go carrier .</review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM8C0mXuv9QXXITc8277ZyufXQZ_81Txr-Qhf1O=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMgWcJ-Ysbk3r-QfM4pHSvRewoH9R3lJ29qJRO3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNtDtW8Cm1HDD9Fh3A4a-pdpXxAdJx-Csa-g6HW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO-cWPusdKQsgmimQGIFCKgq4e8imR1jCtN30Jc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< Resp>

I have been waiting over 3 years to come back to this restaurant.  It was well worth the wait. I was worried that the food might be different under new management  but it was still great. Service was great. Decor well not so nice.< /review>

Place - It is easy to find. There are lots of tables inside. Good for large group. Clean interior.

Taste - I ordered a wanton soup and lunch menu.

* Wanton soup - I thought it is wantin noddle soup but it was just wanton soup. There were avfew wantons, a few vegies and few meat. The amount was too small. My boyfriend ordered it and ate all for few minutes. If u want a meal, it will be better to order wanton noddle soup.

Taste was soso. Nothing special. The quality of wanton and soup was not really good.

* Lunch combo -Lunch combo was btw 11am to 5pm. I could choose one appiti and meat. It came with egg fried rice and noddle. I picked chicken satay and pad kraw(beef). The dish was good! Especially, chicken satay was greally good. Others were also good but overall little salty.

Service and Price - Service was good but little slow. Price was reasonable.<//review>

We chose Old Siam due to it's amazing proximity to our hotel and the amount of vegetarian options available compared to other Thai restaurants nearby. However, we feel it was a bad choice. I knew going in not to expect very high class service, but we weren't even offered water. We had to ask for it outright once the food came. The food itself was not very good. The fried rice was lacking salt, or some similar seasoning, badly. It was extremely bland. The pad Thai was slightly better but nothing to write home about. Also our table of 2 had an automatic 18% gratituity added, which wasn't advertised at all, and we found extremely strange. The only good thing I can say it that it was quick.< /review>

Foodie paradise. Outstanding assistance with cheese selection. See photo below.

Great neighborhood for a few blocks in both directions on Polk. Sit in the afternoon sun on the bench in front of Leopold's. Buy full selections of groceries at friendly Real Food, including impressive fish and meat department way in the back.< /review>

Taste of the food was fair.Not very expensive . The restaurant is open till late.They have vegetarian options and the rest of the menu was customizable.The seating is kind of congested. Closely spaced tables. The server didn't ask us about our preferred spice level.We found the food bland.Rest no complaints!<//review>

This place is busy and a bit old looking but the food is delicious. I had the shrimp curry with a side of rice. A bit pricey for dinner for one. $14+$2 = $16. Still, the food is was prepared well, the shrimp had a good ‘spice’ to them and the rice was perfect. Recommend this place for a quick bite after a night out on the town.< /Text>

<pics>None</pics><text>Nice location and staff is also very pleasant. I wanted to go because they had a beef stew, which is not your normal Thai food on the menu. And it was pretty good and so was the price, $7.00 I think, not bad. They also have large bottles of Chang beer which is also hard to come by. Another awesome thing they had at each table is your own condiment caddy, which had vinegar, chili, sugar. This how it is normally served in Thailand, you make the taste you like.< /text><rate>4</rate>< date>

The saving grace for this place is the food. Although we ordered the same thing. My husband and I, the portion sizes were very much different.  The service is usually good. This time they were extremely slow with less than 50% capacity.  Not usually like them. I would go back, but geesh speed it up! You only get so much time for lunch.</Review>

This restaurant is a ripped off. Beware of your bill and the final bill. They charge you tax and 18% gratuity upfront. The 18% gratuity is part of the 1st bill. 2nd time she will bring you another bill and show blank on the gratuity section and need your signature. Dont fall for it.< /Review>

We went here because the Thai place next door had a huge line. Pad Thai was a bit off taste-wise. The atmosphere wasn't really for me. Service was good, though!< /text>

Order was not ready on time. 20 minutes passed with me being ignored...

Medium spicy was just right. Taste was excellent and food was well prepared. Service was speedy and friendly. Less expensive than Million Thai and equally tasty. Less crowded and noisy than Bangkok Thai and this place takes credit cards. I'd say it was the best of the 3.</review>< response>

<Text>Prompt, efficient, and courteous service in a casual and non-intimidating environment.  HUGE portions, and amazingly flavorful no matter the dish.  I went back a second time to try other dishes and was completely satisfied both times.  Casual atmosphere, surprisingly inexpensive.  Highly, highly recommended.</Text>< Rate>

<review>We went here late on a Friday night to eat some food after a long day of travel.  We were seated pretty quickly.  It's definitely a "hole in the wall" type place---nothing to get dressed up to the nines for.   The dishes are decent sizes and the food is pretty good.   The service can be a little slow, but shouldn't stop you from eating here.   For an affordable dinner that will leave you full, you can't go wrong with this Thai food.</review>< UserId.>

Great place with tasty food. Arrived alone at peak time on a Sunday eve. No problem they said and soon called my name. They accommodated me without fuss. At request beer came first (usually Asian or Indian restaurants tend to bring meals all at once). Greatly recommend for the cleanness of the place, fast service, friendly approach and of course food was authentic thai. Loved it.</Review>

<Text>A bit sceptical when arriving to the restaurant (a bit like an old diner from the outside). But when we get inside the smell of good food was incredible and then when food arrived the good impression was confirmed.
Great food, friendly team and very good price!! Don't hesitate to try the sticky mango rice as desert (too yummy)!<//Text>< name>

The old Siam saved my vacation in San Francisco,

From the first time I entered that door I returned for more, have been there every day throughout my entire stay( 8 times)
The service is awesome, attentive and fast, they are really flexible on tweaking the dishes and special requests are not turned down.
The portions are of decent size and it is a lot of value for the money.
Flavours are authentic and i did linger on the taste.

Thanks guys and girls

<Text>A bit sceptical when arriving to the restaurant (a bit like an old diner from the outside). But when we get inside the smell of good food was incredible and then when food arrived the good impression was confirmed.
Great food, friendly team and very good price!! Don't hesitate to try the sticky mango rice as desert (too yummy)!</Text>< gmapID>

The food was pretty average. Service was slow to seat us, but then rushed, and I needed to remind the staff about parts of my order. Overall, not great.<//text>

Very good chicken satay, egg rolls, and bbq chicken. The lunch special we had was abundant, and even the fried rice, while simple, was very good. My new fav Thai restaurant in SF, and we just walked in out of the rain by accident.< /text>

This place was OK. I tried a pork belly meal. The pork was low quality, and in general I did not really like the dish. The staff was great and very attentive though. Probably would try it again if I'm in town. Very convenient I'd you're staying in Union Square.< /Text>

<text>Waitress was rude.  Good food.   They added tofu and I had asked for none politely, They forgot my lime, so I asked for one, reluctantly she got it, then I noticed I had no utensils so i asked for chop sticks- she barks back-"ANYTHING ELSE?!" As if I had forgotten the items.   They are busy because the food is good but service needs IMPROVEMENT.< /text><Time>1498842504479</Time>< Gmap_id>

<Text>Shocking attitude and approach to customer service!!
I ordered 2 dishes for take out, both $10 on the menu. They charged me $12 for each and when I pointed out the price on the menu they just said it’s an old menu, even though there was a whole stand full of them.
I spoke to “Yam” who was not willing to resolve the situation in any shape or form. When I asked to speak to the manager, she just said “there’s no one here”. (As if!)
Such a shame that the staff were not willing to honour the price on the menu. Terrible attitude and poor approach to service. I will spend my money elsewhere!<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

I was ordering to go. Phad Thai with tofu $12- only had 3 pieces of tofu! Tamarind flavour wasn't right. It wasn't terrible but it was barely Phad Thai.
$8 for x4 tiny egg rolls.

<Text>We wanted to try something away from our regular places down at Union Square so we started just walking around.  Not really sure what we wanted to eat, decided that we couldn't go wrong with Thai food.  They have a lunch menu on the weekend, which I rarely see anywhere.  I got the Spicy Moo Krob which is a crispy pork belly with green beans and bell peppers.  My daughter got their beef noodle soup.  We shared an order of the Siam wings, I was expecting the fired wings that you dipped in the sweet sauce, this was fried then stir fried with the sauce.  The pork belly was dry, hence the 3 stars.  Service is good here and there's a stream of customers coming in and out.  I'll come back, my daughter said her noodle soup was very good, and I want to try that.<//Text>< Pics>

I had the green curry.  Just the right amount of heat. This is one of those  "hole-in-the-wall" places you love to find when you just want great flavor for not much money.<//review>

I ordered fried egg rolls and pad Thai. Really easy food.
The rolls seemed they have been fried in an very old oil and the noodles seemed cooked in an unwashed pan cooking different dish with different tastes.
The service was so-so.
The waitress offered 10% discount: I had barely ate 3 spoons...
First time I'm going to a super well rated restaurant and it end up being a disappointment.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

My go-to place for roasted duck noodle soup! Not too pricey and the best I've had out of ~5 places I've tried in the city. I like to add the pickled jalapenos and vinegar it comes with to make it spicy!<//Text>

Pair all that with a prime location just minutes from Union Square and all the action in the Tenderloin district, and this place has the makings of a prime pre-game spot for a Saturday night on the town.</text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Satisfied my panang craving with gusto. Great flavor and good heat in the dish. Plenty of big chunks of chicken in the dish. Staff is a little chaotic but friendly and efficient.< /text>

The green curry is the perfect blemd of spice and amooth flavor, just the way I like it. Such yum. On top of that, the service was impeccable. Pair all that with a prime location just minutes from Union Square and all the action in the Tenderloin district, and this place has the makings of a prime pre-game spot for a Saturday night on the town.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

I got a lunch set with panang curry and chicken satay. They somehow got it wrong and brought me some grilled meat instead of curry. I called the waitress to let her know I got the wrong dish and they took it back to change it. The curry bowl was so small and with just around 6 or 8 bites of chicken breast. The taste of the food was good though.< /Review>

<text>When they mess up my order, they are always rude.  Sometimes they don’t make it extra spicy, if I bring it back they add extra spice, but burn it in the process.  If you ask to speak to the manager,  “ there isn’t one.”  I order shrimp pad Thai Extra spicy, with extra shrimp.  Tails off... sometimes they get it right sometimes it’s WRONG<//text>< pictures>

Food was ok. However, the service left a lot to be desired. After we sat down,  it took 20 minutes for someone to take our order. Once we ordered, it took another 20 minutes to get our food. I tried the raspberry lemonade and it was un-drinkable.  I'd maybe use them again for takeout only.<//Review>

The ignorance of this staff was so perverse that i questioned whether I have actually become invisible!!!!  At that time there was a group of 3 young men seated on the bench waiting.  After approximately 10 minutes another set of diners entered. They were immediately greeted and asked about seating preference. When I calmly pointed out this unfair, discriminatoty and blatantly racist behavior to the hostes, she remained indifferent and unapologetic. I pray for her soul.</Text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x8085808f79eabf8d:0x8823d9ca2b0a427< /GmapID></record>

<rating>3</rating><text>Never been here before but was in the area and needed some dinner on the cheap side.  Twas about 6:30PM on a Monday and there were not many diners when I sat down (it filled up a bit while I was there).  Service was good and everyone was quite friendly.  The atmosphere was low key and relaxed.

I went for the pad thai and a Tsingtao.  Came to $13 and change. The only option for the entree was shrimp and tofu, which was fine with me, but I only got four shrimp or so (i think) and most still had the tail on.  I really should learn to ask for the tails to be removed.  There were very few peanut crumbs, served on the side with a small garnish of cabbage.  The noodles themselves were a little on the rubbery side and clumped together a bit, especially towards the bottom of the plate.  Considering the service, the touristy area, and the prices, I considered the meal adequate.  I was not expecting fine dining.< /text>< pictures>

It was OK I liked the food because there was no cilantro on it... but they were very late serving the food and also asking and it was almost empthy...
The price it is very good i thought it was going to be much more expensive but it wasn't!< /Text>

I went in being a bit apprehensive but was pleasantly surprised. The place is decidedly not upscale but had a well run, well established feeling. Food was excellent and good value for money.<//review>

its a very very bad experience having dinner in this restaurant. the staffs are so rude. we have been waiting too long for our food to come, and after we have done our meal. the soup was not even ready and when we were finished eating and ask for the bill we asked them to cancel the tom yum soup and sorry was not even the first word that come out. they just checked served us the soup which we didnt want to have it anymore. when we asked for the bill. we thought that the service is not up to our standard so we left few coins of our change in the table. after we came out the staff chased us asking us to pay the TIP which its up to us wheter we want to give it or not. we know that we have to pay at least service charge we left our money on the table but the staff asked us to pay more. why must we give you TIP if you didnt deliver such a good sevice? if you want people to pay the service charge then you should put a service charge and NOT chasing your customer for not paying TIP as much as you want!< /text>

< Review>
Really kind, attentive, service-focussed employees at this tasty old-school Thai restaurant.Went here on a recent Friday night for dinner with a friend, sister and infant and were promptly seated and attended to. Two of us got the large bowls of pho-like "fresh beef" (we guessed, seemingly correctly, that "fresh" was code word for "raw") soup, in which they kindly replaced noodles with various vegetables, which also had a surprising, and happy, quantity of tender beef tendon in it. The broth was flavoursome, complex, with notable flavours of star anise and Szechuan pepper. It was a bit on the salty side, but delicious.
We also got the pad see ew with chicken, and liked its layered tastes and the chewiness of the wide rice noodles. The total for the 3 of us came to about $35, including a beer.
Really appreciated the welcoming atmosphere and the fact that the the music was kept at a low volume!<//Review>

(Translated by Google) While I was searching for hot noodles, I visited Old Siam, a Thai restaurant near to the hotel.
41.BBQ pork with egg noodle with Wanton
I ordered it, but the first impression that seems poor compared to the size of the bowl. Poetic noodle was eaten in Korea.
The bottom line was that the broth was deep and the bok choy looked like vegetables, meat, and dumplings were so delicious and the noodles didn't seem to be loose, but it was thin so it seemed to cut the broth well.
It didn't look very clean because of the interior, but it was a good place to come by and it's a good place to visit.

41. BBQ pork with egg noodle with Wanton
주문했는데 그릇 크기에 비해 부실해보이는 첫 인상으로 시적한 누들은 한국에서 먹던 ... 무슨맛이지 ㅋㅋ 약간 라멘 맛과 비슷한데 요리명 기억이 안나네요
결론은 국물도 깊고 청경채같이 보이는 야채도, 고기도, 만두도 너무 맛있었고 면이 잘 안풀어진 것 같았지만 얇아서 육수도 잘 베어있던 것 같고 나름 탄력도 있어서 식감도 좋았습니다
인테리어 때문인지 아주 청결해보이는 느낌은 아니었지만 우연히 들린, 추천할만한 맛집이었고 다음 샌프란 방문때도 꼭 들르도록 해야겠습니다 ㅎㅎ<//text>

Hesitated, but please eat.
It's not salty, you can eat the fried rice noodles that you eat in hot Korea.
It is soaked in hot broth.
The price is also affordable.

Ideal for a quick dinner of Thai food. The spicy "medium" level is very light. If you go for something more spicy, you must notify them to do so in the preparation.

(Translated by Google) Calamari and raw spring rolls appetizer was delicious, but lemon grass chicken is flaky, ginseng is strictly not good enough.

<Review>(Translated by Google) Delicious the Old Siam Duck and the prices of the relatively cheap dishes, are around 15 usd. Very close to the Powel station in San Francisco. Ideal for a quick dinner of Thai food. The spicy "medium" level is very light. If you go for something more spicy, you must notify them to do so in the preparation.

(Translated by Google) If you're tired of the high price and salty foods you want to spit out, and you're tired of the bitter San Francisco wind, you can soothe your soul with hot broth and the perfect Thai food for your mouth. You can fill your stomach satisfactorily and melt your frozen body. $ 25 with two main foods is enough. I recommend it.

<Review>(Translated by Google) Really, believe me, I have to try this in San Francisco. It’s not too far from Union Square. It tastes so good that I have to relish this Thai food every time I travel more than a week. The Tom Yum Kung soup is really better than that. Anyone I have eaten should be delicious, pineapple and shrimp fried rice is also delicious, not to mention the thai iced tea!

(Original)
真的，相信我，去旧金山一定要尝尝这家，离着联合广场不太远，味道太赞了，以至于我后面一周多的旅行每次都回味这顿泰国菜，冬阴功汤真心比我吃过的任何一家都要好喝，菠萝虾仁炒饭也好吃，thai iced tea就更不用说啦！< /Review>< Pics>

(Translated by Google) The place doesn't say much. But the dishes are authentic and delicious, and the attention of the staff is more than effective and very pleasant. The place is very clean, including the toilet. I have visited it on many occasions and I have tasted almost the entire menu and knowing Thai food very well, I can say that the flavors are exceptional and the dishes are large. Always satisfied. It is also steps from the cable car terminal, the Nordstrom / Bloomingdale shopping center, Macy's and Union Square. What more could you want ? Oh, don't forget the dessert, MANGO WITH STICKY RICE. !!!

Muy buen restaurante. La primera vez que iba a uno de estos sitios, y el servicio ayuda mucho a elegir entre la grandisima variedad de platos que ofrecen, tanto veganos como normales que digamos. El servicio ayudaba mucho, y la comida estaba riquisima.</review>
