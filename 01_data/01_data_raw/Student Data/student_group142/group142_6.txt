<pics>None<//pics><review>I saw an ad in a magazine and it intrigued me because my dad has chronic back pain.  We went to the store in Huntington Beach.  Frank was our salesman and he was great.  Very informative, took care to truly measure my dad's feet, and had him try various options/sizes/widths to make sure it was the best fit.  No pressure at all.  Frank reminded us of the 30 day guarantee and he helped find a discount coupon for us to use since I forgot to bring it in.  Excellent service.  Now we'll see if the shoes truly help my dad's back!<//review></record></dataset><record>

What amazing customer service. I really felt valued and respected. The shoes are so comfortable. My heal pain is so much less than before.<//text>

<time>1553265380768<//time><rate>5< /rate><Text>So, my wife and I were at the LA Travel Expo recently looking into options for France when we happened upon a booth where people were trying out shoes! Well, we passed by once and came back around because our curiosity got the better of us. At first we questioned why there would be a booth for shoes at a travel show but, much like Meat Loaf, it’s all coming back to me now and making sense. My wife just went to South Africa and guess what shoes she took??? No, it wasn’t these but...haha! She took her Gravity Defyer shoes, of course! Anyway, I bought both the Mightywalk shoes and the Ron sandals for myself. At first, I was ready to return them. Apparently my feet didn’t like all the coddling at first. However, I gave them a chance as the instructions say and now I have to say that they’ve ruined my feet for “regular” shoes! These shoes and sandals are great! By the way, Vito and Rene (a guy named Rene? Odd, right?) were awesome. They treated us well and were very professional. Vito even mailed me some laces after the show because they had run out. Anyway, both my wife and I are very pleased!</Text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

It's recommended to break in the shoes over 3-5 days because they promote a new way of standing and walking as well as improved body alignment. However, we also know that they won't be ideal for everyone and we would not recommend continued use if you feel like they are hurting your back. This feedback is very important to us and we appreciate you sharing - we are constantly working on developing and improving our design and technology."}</Response>< Review>
I think these are the worst shoes I've ever worn. I'm on my feet all day and I always used to wear runners but I read the good reviews so decided to give it a shot. They hurt my back to bad seriously something must be wrong with the design or "science" behind it.</Review>

I’m very pleased to say that this store is amazing! I had a fellow named Dan help me out. He was able to put me in the right direction on which shoe to decide on and thanks to him and this company I have finally found a shoe I can live with. I have plantar fascitis and just by wearing the shoe with the orthotics has made the pain go away. If you have a minute to stop by this store you should! Thank you Gravity Defyer and Dan!< /review>

It's not so much the store, but their business hrs.
They posted open 'till 9 pm.  Drove all the from Redondo Beach,
took an hour and half to get there around 8 and they're closed.

My husband finally got to the store, and bought a pair.
He loves his Gravity Defyer.  Appreciated Alex's input!</Text>

I had plantar fascitis. I had tried several insoles and braces but to no avail. Finally saw these shoes and decided it may be worth the cost. Guess what? It was!!! After 4 weeks or so( not sure exactly how long cause it's been awhile ago) I realized there was no more pain. I am so thankful I bought these shoes. Was worth the price!!!!!</text>

I first saw this shoe advertised on Facebook and was interested to know more since I have issues with neuropathy and my husband has plantar fasciitis. Our curiosity led us to the Gravity Defyer store in Huntington Beach where we were greatly helped by both Jessica and Dan. They were super patient with our trying different shoe options and offered helpful suggestions. The shoes are awesome so far and I expect them to have a positive impact both general and gym use.</review>

Yea they are comfortable, but for the price they are not worth it....paid over 100 dollars for a show that came apart in under a year, and I didn't even wear them everyday!  No wonder they only have a 120 day guarantee.<//Text>

OUR SALESMAN GEORGE WAS THE MOST PROFESSIONAL SHOE SALESMAN WE HAVE EVER MET. HE WELCOMED US INTO THE STORE, TOLD US ALL ABOUT GRAVITY DEFYER, AND PROCEEDED TO BRING OUT AT LEAST TEN DIFFERENT PAIRS OF SHOES FOR BOTH MY WIFE AND I. MY WIFE HAS A SMALL SIZE 5 FOOT, AND SHE APOLOGIZED TO GEORGE FOR HAVING TO TRY ON SO MANY SHOES. HE SAID NO PROBLEM HE LOVED MAKING CUSTOMERS HAPPY. IN THE END, NOTHING WORKED FROM STOCK, SO HE ORDERED HER TWO PAIR. WHEN WE CAME BACK TO TRY THEM ON THE SHOES THAT WE ORDERED, WE GOT THE SAME POLITE AND REFRESHING SALESMAN AND ONCE AGAIN HE VERY CHEERFULLY HAD MY WIFE TRY THEM ON AND HE LACED THEM UP. SHE BOUGHT BOTH PAIRS OF SHOES AND IS VERY HAPPY WITH THEM AND ALSO VERY HAPPY THAT GEORGE MADE BUYING THE SHOES SUCH A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE. YOU ARE LUCKY TO HAVE A SALESMAN AS COMPETENT AS GEORGE, JUST AS WE WERE LUCKY TO HAVE HIM AS OUR SALESMAN.

<Review>Worst shoe store ever!

We got sucked into buying 3 pairs for orthopedic issues. Shoes were ok, they did have some nice features but they were poorly made and not worth the money.

The service is unreliable. The staff is nice but comes across very salesy. Almost like a car salesman. The worst part is that for a store that sells shoes, they are terrible at actually selling shoes. Multiple times they promised to get a certain model or size from their Burbank store... never arrived and worst part was that they sold us the wrong size rather than admitting their mistake! Yes our fault for not checking but by this time it was our 3rd visit and was just picking them up to purchase!!!!

Finally, just returned them because it was too much hassle to wait for their 3rd attempt to get the right size only to find that the store clerk didn't know how to do a return. She said the return will happen the next day and  3 days later... Still nothing. No call no money back. Their store phone doesn't pick up and customer service doesn't return messages. Filing a dispute with my credit card company to get my money back.

Save yourself time money and grief... Don't go in!!</Review>< user>

Watch your cards ..... This company will charge you way after you have already paid...... A shoe company that won't let you return after 6mo even if they haven't been worn     Buyer beware!<//Review>

<review>Tim was awesome in helping us with our car. One morning our car didn’t start normal, and the engine light came on. I quickly called him, and he instantly said I could drop the car off even though they weren’t able to work on it that day. Once they were able to, Tim was quick to communicate with us, and we appreciated his honest opinion about everything. It’s hard to find someone that you can trust with your car! We will definitely be taking our cars to Tim from now on!<//review><UserId.>100209798374722303202</UserId.>< name>

Always a good experience.  I know my vehicle will be well taken care of, repairs will be done right the first time and are usually done pretty quickly.  Love the new system showing pictures of the issues (and non-issues) after their inspection but before any work is done!  Just had oil change, control arm replaced and full brake/rotor replacement completed on my 2003 Accord.  I know this car will last me many more years with these guys taking care of me and my car!</text>

Import Auto clinic took care of me just like they always do. Did some looking around the first time I needed work done and I’m glad I went here. Tim is always really helpful and seems like they have a good team, best part is they let you know what’s good on your car, what might need future attention and of course fix your current issues, would definitely recommend them to anyone give them a shot! They won’t let you down!< /review>

<Review>Tim kept me informed about the broken trunk latch and broken bulb ( it was a critter that was eating the wire to the turn indicator). The water pump had to be replaced due to a leak.
They checked the brakes, tires and battery as requested as well.
I was sent photos and percentages for each item before work began.
Very pleased again with the service<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

This is my first time visiting this shop and you always get those doubts as a first time visitor to a new shop. The inspection was awesome. They show you pictures, tell you what’s good, what should be on your radar, and what needs your attention.

This is the place where I’ll come back for my repairs and maintenance. Awesome job by this shop. Hopefully I don’t get to visit often but if I need to, I’ll be back. Thank you for creating that trust and loyalty.<//review><user_id>116510641626953641601</user_id>< Time>

<review>The needs servicing report is super helpful that I received, and it was very well done, and easy to understand. I was treated wonderfully by the staff, and the shop is incredibly clean. The whole facility is well kept and it reminded me of the same standards the dealership holds. Definitely coming back again. I’ve had several services here now and fixes with no issues or hassles.< /review>< Pictures>

<text>Tim was so helpful and so accommodating! My car was well taken care of and they didn't try to tell me a million things were wrong with it which since I'm a woman, unfortunately happens frequently. I highly recommend Import Auto! Your car will be in good hands and you won't have to go being ripped off.</text><Response>None<//Response>< user>

My first experience with this shop has been a pleasant one. I brought in my Mustang to diagnose a ticking noise though the car seems to drive just fine. Tim provided me with a clear and concise break down with their diagnostic procedure. He didnt push for any unneccessary repair work and provided daily updates through the diagnostic process. Turned out to be nothing serious. I will be coming back for any future repairs and service.</Text>

Had to get a new head and gasket on my Volvo.  after being turned down by  the Volvo Dealership in Santa Ana, plus after getting my car misdiagnosed  and belittled by them...I went to Import Car auto clinic. They were absolutely amazing, honest and professional, they fixed my car for cheaper than what I was quoted. Tim Was super nice and I highly recommend him and all the mechanics! My Volvo means a lot to me and I am grateful that they got it running again for a reasonable price! Thank you!</Text>

Let me begin by saying that I have never come across a set of people as amazing as those here at Import Auto Clinic. Living in CA, having a car is a necessity. When my car broke down, I went to Meineke to get a diagnostic test and let's just say that it was a joke. They were dishonest, rude and tried taking advantage and overcharging for a job that I didn't need. It wasn't my first time, or my second time, going there but each time my experience was worse. I'm grateful to have found people like Tim here at Import Auto Clinic. Tim, and his team of extremely knowledged professionals, have been transparent and honest about everything regarding my car situation. Even after getting a another car, I found myself returning to him and they all helped me out! These people are amazing, kind and definitely try their best to help anyone out!! If I could rate more than 5 stars I would! Seriously wouldn't take my car anywhere else! Tim if you're reading this, YOU ROCK!🤘🤘🤘🙌<//Text>

<pictures>None</pictures><Text>My alternator had stopped working and I was stranded in Anaheim so without much option I went to the nearest auto shop I could be taken by AAA. This place seemed professional at first but they tried to get me to replace a battery that didn't need to be replaced and when I came to get my car I had to get it on a Friday over Thanksgiving break so they left my keys underneath the floormat. The issue I had was when I went to go get my car someone left my car door open so when I arrived my battery had died. I had to wait an hour and a half for AAA to come by and start up my battery. Incredibly unprofessional and wasting my time is not how I want to spend my Friday.<//Text>< Name>

{'time': 1606943706544, 'text': 'Hi Brendan, sorry about the issues you experienced, our goal is for everyone is to leave our shop with a positive experience and a good running, reliable vehicle. You opted out of replacing the battery we recommended because of a family mechanic you wanted to do the repair (we can certainly understand that). We believe your battery was likely damaged from the alternator failure, causing it to overcharge. The battery tested below acceptable levels, which is why we recommended replacing it. We are disappointed it didn’t last the two days it sat waiting to get picked up, but not surprised. The door being left open was a surprise to us, especially since we left Wednesday night while it was dark outside. I do know that is not how you wanted to spend your Friday, which is why we called you back to see if we could help any (even though we were closed for the Thanksgiving weekend). Take care and Merry Christmas!'}</Resp>

I would recommend import auto clinic to anyone looking for a honest business.  Unfortunately...my car wasn't with fixing...but instead of doing it anyway just to make money...Tim was totally honest.  So freshing in these times.  I will definitely be taking my new car there for any work.< /review>

I came to this place as it is highly recommended by a friend. I'm glad i found this place. They are very professional.  I came for my Audi with a check engine light on and running rough. We thought it was the end of the road for the car. But they were able to fix it and now it’s running like new again. I really appreciate Andy for his honesty and the rest of the team. I’ll be taking all my car here from now on for service. Recommend this place.< /text>

I was referred to Imports Auto Clinic when my normal mechanical felt he wasn’t able to handle the more in-depth work on my Mercedes, I met with Tim at the shop and he communicated with me everyday of the work that was needed and the costs associated so there was no surprises come bill time. My cars been running great and all of the work and diagnostic tests that were done were emailed to me for reference each day. I will definitely use Import Auto Clinic in the future! Thank you!</review>

serviced, including repairs. Excellent quality work, never had any problems. No sales pressure to have something done I didn't want. They are a lot cheaper than having your car serviced at the actual car dealer! They have free loan cars, and depending on the distance, they will drop you off at your home and will pick you up when requested.

<Review>Those of you who know me, know I am a car guy.  For those of you who don’t, I have been working on “wrenching” on cars since I was 12.  I have worked in the car business for nearly 20 years.  I can tell you that IAC is trust worthy,  dependable and super nice.  If you need some work check them out.  If you need some maintenance done, do it sooner rather than later as it usually costs less.  You now know where to go,  IAC.</Review>< pictures>

<Review>They made my car go again. When car go to import auto clinic, it no go. It was broken car, wheel no turn.
Tim and Wesley see car, say "how you do this to car?! Car broken, but we fix car."
I say, "you fix car fast?"
They say "we try, but car big bad broken."
They fix car fast, only one dark time. Me am like Import Auto Clinic. Me give 5 shiny sky balls.

After being constantly misled at dealerships and other auto shops, Dave and team were a breath of fresh air. I was quoted honestly and fairly, and only for work that actually needed to be done. Dave provided a detailed and easy-to-understand inspection report (with photos!) with a clear hierarchy of needs for my vehicle, and helped me prioritize which to address first and which to plan for in the future. My vehicle is running impeccably, and service was completed in an extremely timely manner. I was extremely pleased with my experience and would highly recommend Import Auto Clinic to anyone, but especially to women, since our lack of knowledge on the subject is traditionally taken advantage of in this realm. The guys in the shop are professional and kind, and I felt very comfortable in there, as well. Would give them ten stars if I could!<//text>

<text>I drive from Huntington Beach to visit this shop.  Much different than your typical car mechanics I’d say. They do what they say they’re gonna do and bottom line....they are honest.  The place runs a great business. They own a fleet of cool loaner cars that’s so convenient for me. I’m happy I’ve finally found a good car shop!

Building a good rapport with the staff. I trust that IAC will always do a good job. Having been there numerous times recently, I am claiming the Subaru Outback loaner as my backup car.<//text></record></dataset><record>

Andy and David did great! I purchased a used car and brought it by to make sure to make sure it was all in ship shape. They looked over the car especially the concerns I had after the test drive. They looked the car over and after declaring it good to go I felt much better! Me and my family have been going to Import Auto Clinic for over 30+ years and I never trust another mechanic to look at my cars!< /text>

They  told me I needed new tires. They even check  with Costco price and got me a better deal. I trusted them with my both of my cars. Being a widow they always help me keep my car for 25 years now.

Amazing service. Up front and honest. They also supply photos of your car so you know what it is they are seeing. Pricing is great too. I went to a different shop a month ago and they said I needed to replace my shocks and struts because they were “completely worn down” and they were full of it! My shocks and struts are fine and I now have pictures to prove it. Such a great place. Thanks again! They also don’t pressure you into fixing more than what needs to be done like other mechanics do. They give you recommendations. That was a definite plus.< /Review>

<Review>I'm a long time customer of IAC.  My driver's side headlight went out, which I noticed right away.  It's been raining for the past week, so for safety reasons, I didn't want to be driving without both headlights operating.

I called IAC the next day and was told to stop on by.  I was in and out very quickly and thankful that it was only the bulb that needed to be replaced (vs. the entire headlamp unit).  I appreciate the service that IAC provides.  That's why I am a long time customer.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80dcd6c6ed9e4d21:0x1b858b5c129867f6< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Extremely friendly, great communication, repaired exactly the right things... they really focus on finding exactly what the issue is and addressing that correctly as opposed to just random trial and error that ends up costing you a lot of money and may or may not fix the issue. Great shop, highly recommend.<//text>

Prompt service with reasonable prices. Booked an appt at the time when they open up for oil change which is around 7:30 AM on Friday morning. By 8:30 AM I was out of the door with everything said and done!

<Review>Called to ask if he can do an oil change with my own bought oil and filter and he said he generally don't and said he got a full house today so he can't attend me. Didn't even bother suggesting a time for me to come buy or when available or even schedule me. Very disappointing first hand experience. I'm sure others got luck but not me.

Edit to your reply: I found another mechanic who accepted my service with my oil and filter.. Which I never had a problem and I don't like mixing brands.. For major repairs, then liability is understandable.. My oil got changed in 15 min in another shop and tire pressure done. They got a good review from me. I'm changing this to 3 stars because at least you acknowledged and cared about my comment. So at least that shows you care about customer experience. Thank you have a good day. Others reading this. This was just my personal experience based on customer service and information provided from them over the phone. This has nothing to do with mechanic work as they did not work on my vehicle. I'm sure their great mechanics. I just didn't get a good first impression from them.< /Review>< user_name>

David and Andy are always honest and helpful. I had pretty extensive repairs that needed  to be done. David worked to keep the cost as low as possible. David informed me of a recall issue that needed to be completed by Volkswagen and he arranged transportation of my car from IAC to the dealership to have the recall performed at no cost to me. I recommend Import Auto Clinic. They have complementary coffee and cold water.< /text>

I always am so embarrassed about the state of my car when I go to a mechanic and David was honestly so helpful and really personable. Knocked down the price in the end and it made my whole month hahah. As a starving artist every penny counts.

Will definitely be going here for everything in the future!!!! Thank you so much guys!<//Review>

< Review>
I brought my 2014 Toyota corolla here to test the charging system. I was charged 175.00 to check my charging system. I was mislead into spending $175.00. I had my battery replaced last year at Toyota so I brought it back to Toyota after coming here. I left my overhead light ON TOYOTA INFORMED ME. I was told by owner of import auto that my alternator and battery needs to be replaced. This place is very untrustworthy. Thanks Toyota service for the battery test results.</Review>

I stumbled upon this little gem Friday afternoon in need of a quick smog check. I was in and out in a flash. The owner is super friendly and treats you like an old friend. Customer Service A++ which is a rare find these days.. I will be back for any and all car needs.** Please note my Google name was changed by my 9 year old so I guess that is who I am now since I don't know how to change it back. 😎<//Text>

This place is about quality. I got my brakes done, and my starter replaced here too. There's free coffee and high-end furniture in the waiting room. The owner even took me to Taco Bell for lunch, and we had some great chats about politics and stuff.

Fast, reliable service, with all your questions answered politely. Would recommend if you love your car.<//text>

<text>I only write a review after viewing that negative review by Leslie.  I've taken every car I've ever owned to import auto clinic.  They are simply the best in quality and best in price, period!   There are no shenanigans, everything is transparent.  I've had blown gaskets fixed, oil changes and everything in between.   Stand-up operation.  Have and will continue to recommend these people to my friends and family.</text><response>None</response>< user>

< review>
I had recently purchased and older VW and had been told there was an oil leak by another servicer. I scheduled an appointment, took the car in and a full inspection and diagnostics report with pictures was provided . They also provided recommendations for immediate and future need so I didn’t feel obligated to do more than what was needed .
Everyone was very professional and the pricing was very comparable to what I had been quoted. It’s been about a week since the repairs and everything sounds good , I’m happy I found this servicer/mechanic close to my house !
Highly recommended !!!< /review>

I called 8 other mechanics before contacting Import Auto clinic. The other mechanics were not capable of replacing the fuel injector on my VW Tiguan. I called Import Auto Clinic and spoke with David, he was familiar with the Tiguan and the common repairs needed for the vehicle. David contacted me every step of the repair, providing an accurate timeline as well as a thorough diagnosis of the work needed. Thankful for finding an auto shop we can trust.<//Text>

<text>First off Think that "1" Star Leslie is unbelievable, Really feel sorry for her, Through past years I have gone to Andy and David Lee with all my vehicles and also had my Son and Daughter do the same.
No they are not cheap but they are good, up front and honest,  if you want cheap go to Pep Boy's, never have I been ripped off, some repairs have cost me money but they have also saved me money, they also do a check, preventative maintenance to, so to speak fix it before it breaks, (which I like).
I have and I will always refer my friends and family (even enemies) to call David Lee and/or Andy when they have a problem, I have that much confidence in them, they have given me loaner cars when needed (No Charge) and even given me a ride home on occasion.
So I need not say anymore.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Always there for you, even in an emergency!
I’ve been with them for years....
It’s the little things that mean a lot, over and above the service they are always willing to go that extra mile for their customers. Thank you Andy, Tim and Wess!<//text>

"Import Auto Clinic" is a well known auto repairing service in Anaheim. From my opinion their auto repair service is really awesome and they did it very efficiently. If you are looking for repair your vehicle in Anaheim then "Import Auto Clinic" should be the first choice for you. So, when you face any kind of problem regarding this then do not hesitate just go to "Import Auto Clinic" and get the best repairing service.</review>

Short review: Great service! Very highly recommend!

Long review: I needed service to my late-90s 4Runner without warning - suddenly throwing codes and driving terribly. Looked up nearby shops and after seeing several positive reviews dropped off my car with the IAC team.
By the next morning (due to my no-notice drop off when they were busy) I had a full email and breakdown of the solution/fix to the problem I came in with, along with a list of all age/mileage related issues with my car. As well as a phone call to discuss that email and those issues. Some of them I was aware of, others I was not. But, after 20+ years even a low-mileage-for-the-age car needs work.
After some short research through my own records of past services to double check a few unknown variables, I went by IAC and talked with David in person a bit more about my options.
I decided to move forward with some major services that I already knew were needed, and others I was unaware of but were just as important to do immediately.
The team there had my car finished several days ahead of time to get it back before the weekend.
David was incredibly friendly, and transparent with all needs of my vehicle, and prompt in all interactions regarding service and updates.
Pricing was very fair and at no point did I feel I was being taken advantage of in the least - and I say this as someone who has worked in/around the auto industry and has personal friends who are auto shop owners.

No one likes dealing with car issues and researching shops, and while I'm very familiar with vehicles, lifespan of parts, approx service timeframes, etc.. And while a direct discussion with David giving me straight "Look, here's what we found.." isn't going to scare me, I know it would terrify others.
So for that reason, the transparency of the services/work I had done, promptness of all updates/questions/needs, and both the compassion and personableness of the staff, I couldn't recommend these guys more.
So for those reading all these reviews wondering "Can I trust this shop?". Yes. You definitely can.</Text>

I have been going to Import Auto Clinic for years.  I just took my Infiniti to the dealer due to some recalls that needed to be fixed and I asked them to take a look at my rear lift gate because it was not working.  They came back and said that my hydrolic lift shocks were leaking/not working and it ended up frying all of the wiring.  The claimed it would cost $1400! I immediately contacted IAC and they said to bring it in.  They got it working with a simple computer reset and it only cost me $13 for a new batt for my key fob and a few minutes of their time. I HIGHLY recommend IAC for any auto repairs.  They provided me a loaner and the staff is always exceptional in their service!  Thank you!</Text>

Friendly, welcoming and helpful staff.
A thorough and complete eye exam with extra attention and explanation provided to an issues that needed clarification in simple terminology. Highly recommend</text>

<review>Thorough and friendly. Whether seeing Ms. Anderson or Ms. Tran (my last two visits), both have been great. I have deep wells and they put me on a glaucoma watch for 2 years, visiting every 6 months. Once they were comfortable that I actually just have deep wells, we're back to only annual check-ins. Great to have a team looking out for these things and being cautious when we'd first met. Now I've been visiting for more than 2 years and couldn't be happier with the experience.< /review>< resp>

<Review>Very modern,  very fast. I got my new glasses ordered very quickly along with a referral to a specialist. If the receptionist (I don't know what else to call her) Becky, hadn't come out to find the old guy that I am, I'd  probably still be wandering around. Thank you Becky. I very positive experience all around.< /Review><Time>1616092178893< /Time><response>None< /response></record>

Very safe inside. Everyone masked and everything thoroughly sanitized including each pair of frames.  Dr. Andersen very knowledgeable my eye conditions.  Allison was super great helping me choose frames.  The lens recommended should be fantastic for my office work.  Overall a completely great experience.<//Review>

Dr, Anderson clearly knows what she is doing. She was very knowledgeable and explained all the different pieces of equipment she had. She will be my go-to optometrist from now on.<//review>

We’ve been extremely happy with Dr. Andersen and her team. My 8 year old daughter recently got contacts and they’ve been so patient and kind in helping her adjust. We’ve had issues along the way with broken glasses and lenses too, and they’ve always rushed to fit us in and get my daughter the help she needs.<//text>

< review>
The most thorough eye exam I've received.  Kathleen is an excellent optometrist.  I worked with her other colleague who was fantastic.  Both are highly professional, thorough using current, leading tech examination tools as well.  The sales staff also professional, courteous & thoughtful in product selection.  They clearly differentiate their practice from a commoditized Costco product, retail service operation.

Excellent practice!  Highly recommend!< /review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>I could not be happier with my experience. The whole staff is awesome! The glasses selection are just top notch. Everything was disinfected in front of me. Felt very comfortable and safe. My eye exam was the best and most accurate I have ever had and I been wearing glasses for 20 years! The equipment was  top of the line for sure Dr Chang was the sweetest and knowledgeable. I 100% recommend everyone to come here. You will leave satisfied and happy with your eye prescription and cool glasses. Thank you everyone! Stay awesome.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

This place was wonderful! The staff was so friendly and the process was relatively quick from exam start to finish. I very much appreciated the doctor's explaining things in detail. The office itself was clean and organized. I'm also very grateful to the staff for their patience in helping me pick out my new frames, I can be very indecisive.</text>

I arrived at 9:40am for my appointment and was immediately processed for my exam to begin.

The first thing I noticed was a new and very large piece of test equipment which as the exam progressed demonstrated its “value” !

I am 75 and I mentioned a slight reduction of comfort and clear vision with my current prescription. This new test determined through “adjustments” to the current lens what the new lens should be.

The rest of the test was comfortable and I ordered new lens for my glasses and chose a second “backup” frame/lens.

I should add that my 23 year old son also has a “challenging” prescription and he also is comfortable with the level of service he receives.<//review>

First time in this office. Great experience. Super friendly and very professional. Was welcomed in and given some hand sanitizer. All equipment was thoroughly wiped down right in front of me prior to use. It felt very safe and very clean. I give it five stars. I will definitely be back.</review>

What a great staff and extremely professional set of Optometrists this place has! Never felt anything but sincere care and a priority for finding out what was best for my long term eye care.
Absolutely the best selection of frames and their customer service is top notch. They contacted me when they said they would and every pair of prescription glasses and prescription sunglasses have been perfect.
I highly recommend Kathleen Andersen!< /Review>

<review>The office staff was very friendly and efficient and I did not wait at all before being taken back for my tests and examination. In addition to the standard vision test, the office is equipped with additional testing equipment that the staff uses to provide information to the Doctor about other health issues with respect to my vision and or eyes.< /review>< date>

Super convenient to RSM and they leverage all the new technology in optometry to give you a thorough high quality exam. Scheduling and appointment were all a breeze, using COVID-19 protocols they got me in and out in no time and I found their frame collection with many good options and had my prescription glasses out to me in one week.<//review>

I actually stumbled into Dr. Andersen's office as I had an appointment next door. After asking a few questions of the staff I set an appointment an cancelled an appointment at a less deserving office. My first visit was equally impressive and I will definitely return for future visits. Dr. Anderson was very professional, detailed and kind. I highly recommend this service.<//Text>

I love having their practice here in Rancho Santa Margarita (I live in Las Flores). This morning, I noticed a screw fell out of my prescription sunglasses and needed them repaired ASAP (I work outside and needed my sunglasses). I was so glad they opened at 8 am! They fixed my sunglasses in just a few minutes so I could proceed with my day! Great customer service!</review>

Trusting my eye health to Dr. Anderson since moving to CA 4 years ago. I wear contacts and Dr. Anderson will fir me with a trial set to try for a week to make certain they work for me prior to ordering. This is extremely helpful. Thorough examination, professional, helpful staff. Great selection on frames, although $$$.<//Review>

<text>Dr. Anderson is so caring and has the very latest technology to help her patients.
I've had severe dry eyes for years and have been using eye drops constantly. After having an eye exam it was recommended that I try the Lipiflow treatment. After the treatment I immediately felt lubrication in my eyes. Because of having severe dry eyes the doctor recommended that I use the Nulids treatment as well. Nulids is so easy to use and it is making a drastic improvement.
I would highly recommend Dr Anderson for all your eye care needs.</text>< Date>

I live out of town and needed new glasses and eye exam. The machines that are used here as well as the Awesome staff put me at ease and even let me know a lot about my health. They were even able to use a machine to scan the lenses I had to tell me what my previous prescription was. They also were able to tell that I did not have diabetes somehow through the exam which was a worry of mine. Really good selection of glasses and reasonable wait time.

Dr Andersen is a good example of old days Medicine were the doctor on first name base and deal with the patient as friend or neighbor. I’m very impressed with her through and efficient clinical examination and the detail explainetion of every steps in every procedures. Her staff are very professional with excellent C/S courtesy.< /Review>

<Review>At best Negligent - or worse Fraudulent - billing practices.

My wife and I went here as cash patients (we don't have vision coverage in our health plan) - and we paid our bill in full for our exams at the time of service.  They required our health insurance information for "their records" but said they would not use it because we were just getting routine annual exams.

we then get a bill from their office for $15 (apparently a co-pay?) where they submitted the same bills we paid for in CASH - in FULL - to our insurance company.  So either they erroneously submitted to the insurance company - or purposefully attempted to double-bill both US (cash patients) and the insurance company.

So we call them multiple times and leave messages; never get a call back.  Months go by - we still get notices for the $15 now past due - and we keep trying to call them to have them reverse the erroneous charges.  NO RESPONSE.

We then get the "red notice" saying they are sending this to collections.  We pay the $15 to simply avoid this stupid charge hitting our credit report.  Important to note - this $15 bill was FROM THIS CLINIC - and was NOT from our insurance company.  So if we were cash patients on the day - paid in full - why would they send us ANOTHER bill later on for $15 (and the bill shows they attempted to bill off against insurance etc).  This document is 100% entirely within their control (and as I confirmed with our insurance company) and this billing was not generated by our insurance company)

Needless to say - regardless of how "nice" their technology and how "high end" their practice is - when a business is non-responsive to fix such a simple issue like this - over many months - then the unethical nature of their billing (with us as their clients bearing the burden of chasing down the issues) - means I will NEVER go to this place again.   I'll also NEVER recommend anyone else go here - because if you do - their obvious efforts to double bill both cash patients and insurance companies will mean you will keep paying (with your time, or $$) for many months beyond the day you see a doctor.< /Review>< pictures>

I went to Kathleen M. Andersen's office because i was having problems with my left. I was seen by Dr. Reyes.   During my first visit she found that I had a macular hole.  After surgery I needed get my eyes examined again because I had distsnce sight issues. I went to my Opthamologists office who miss directed me and was not able to help. I went directly back to see Dr. Reyes whi was able to see that very moment.  I love this office and all those who work there. I highly reccomend them.<//Text>

I agree with the last reviewer, they try to upsell you.  Imagine that I was charged $60 for TRYING ON contacts.  How else would one know what to wear without trying them on?  I checked around and was told this was outrageous.  I have great insurance and this place had the nerve to send me another bill for $10.00 after overcharging me for everything else.  After sending a message to the "Dr" of how displeased I was and that we wouldn't be coming back, she sent me a CERTIFIED letter telling me and I quote "Good luck finding someone that will try on contacts for free,  I will no longer service your family."  Imagine the unprofessionalism of that.  Don't go here, there's a great real eye doctor in Ladera Ranch and others in Rancho that fully surpass this one without the headache and over paying for nothing.  I wouldn't go back if it was free.</review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

This place tries to up sell you all the expensive "technology".

I've been waiting for over 2 weeks for my frames, and they didn't take all the measurements when I was there. So now i'm stuck waiting even longer for a job that my partner did a costco and got it done in less than a week.

I got attitude when asked about the alternative's to the "top of the line" technology, and when I told them i'd be back to pay because they don't take American Express I was looked at like a crazy person and got more attitude.<//review></record></dataset><record>

We always get the best service here doesn't matter what sometimes you sure play the still serve you and give you the price if like they're not fully Busy.. but besides that they always have whatever you need they always have the most simple thing which is  Orange chicken broccoli beef.. the egg rolls are like the size of burritos which are amazing.  The egg rolls some have meat some have shrimp or just straight out veggie their amazing.</Text>

I prefer these family owned joints rather than Panda Express because the food is better depending on where you go. Unlike other ones, the lady that was there was so nice, unlike some other chinese restaurants I've been too. The food is good and the fried wings are really addicting. Highly recommended family owned alternative to panda express.<//review>

<text>Food is really great and inexpensive!🖤🖤🖤 and the people/owner is very nice with all her customers.  All food items are delicious but our favorite is their fried rice, noodles, orange chicken, bbq pork, their wings! And their wonton/mix soups!!! The best!!!🖤🖤🖤<//text>< pics>

<Review>Been going here for years..  fast food..  hot good tasting.  Gets busy with locals like ourselves..and lunch hour workers that are around the area..  Known place also for Kaiser employees....   very friendly but dont take them for grated..  very smart owner ..   Been here longer than i can remember....
Try the wor wonton soup the best on cold days....
Bad reviewers must be very picky or naturally complainers anywhere you they go....</Review>< pictures>

<text>No words can describe the ultimate satisfaction I've gotten while visiting Hong Kong Fast Food In Baldwin Park. This Is hands down the best Chinese fast food I've tasted In this side of town, or if not the whole valley. Well cultured and long established business throughout decades, across the In-N-Out In Baldwin Park on Francisquito Ave.<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

This is my favorite spot! You're always welcomed like family and they'll take the time to talk to you. The food is delicious as well. I always get their orange chicken, BBQ pork, and egg rolls.</Text>

<Text>I've always had great customer service at this family owned business. You always get greeted with a smile & if the owner is there she will always ask you how you're doing. They are consistently bringing out fresh food from the kitchen so you always have fresh food. I highly recommend this place.</Text><user>112222800234161510392< /user>< response>

I feel like i did not get my money's worth, I paid over $7 for a plate and it honestly was not worth it. I won't ever come back here again only because of the quality of the food, it's probably the cheapest they could find.</Review>< username>

They only accept cash or debit cards with a $0.79 change for using a debit card. No restroom; as I like to sit and read the news on my tablet while I eat, sometimes the call of nature, well calls, and without having a restroom, it's a deal breaker. Also, while the food appears to be fresh, it had absolutely no flavor.< /Text>

Great taste, great price,  and the best part, they don't use those premeasured serving size spoons, they just pile your food on really high, until your container can't hold anymore.</text>

<rating>5</rating><Text>Forget auto zone, if you need auto parts in Lancaster go to carquest. You will be more than satisfied. They have people who are very knowledgeable about the business of auto parts, they try to make sure that you get the correct part the first time. I am a mechanic and spend a lot of money on parts, I use to go to auto zone because they were convenient but when you ended up making 3-4 trips to return the wrong part, it is easy to drive the extra few miles to get it right the first time. I will be using carquest exclusively from now on.< /Text>< pictures>

<text>Excellent help, have people that can look up some old car and truck parts that most other big stores computers can't access. They have the parts Now because they stock $1.5 million in parts vs. AutoZone at about $400k in stock. OReileys is even worse.
I live by AutoZone and OReileys but often they don't have what I need and are just too damn busy. I pay a few bucks more at Carquest and get great help fast and quality parts. They are like the parts store I worked at in the old days. Even the auto repair shops I go to use them.< /text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

I got a puppy last year(Riley) and I started going here because it was the closest vet to my new house. Very friendly staff and clean office. The puppy package was well worth it, which included visits, shots, heartworm tests, etc. for the full first year of my puppy's life. Truly outstanding care and affordable!!

Speaking of OUTSTANDING care, Dr. Kwon is so thorough!! Before my dog got fixed, Dr. Kwon made sure that my husband and I had a clear understanding of the procedure.

For example, he personally called us before the surgery to let us know exactly when he would be starting, and gave us an update on Riley's well-being up to that point. He also called us immediately after the surgery to let us know that they were all finished and gave us another update on Riley's well-being post surgery. He made sure we had follow-up appointments set, so that he could monitor the healing process. When I picked Riley up, the doctor used a visual aid to further explain what exactly was done during surgery. He even waited after business hours, so that I could still pick up Riley after I got off work. Thank you Dr. Kwon and staff!!

If you are looking for a vet, this is certainly the place to go!! Dr. Kwon knows Riley's name when we come into the office, and he refers to Riley as "your baby" when we talk. This office gets it!! Great job!!<//Text>

My visit at Irvine Great Park Animal Hospital was outstanding. My 14 year old dog, Sabrina, had a ruptured growth on her left rear leg. I was concerned about it being cancerous, being that it was large and bleeding nonstop. I spoke with Dr. Kwon about the issues she was having and he had gone over all the possibilities that it could be and what he thinks is the best option for her, considering her age. After speaking with Dr. Kwon he helped me decide what was best for Sabrina. Dr. Kwon never pressured me to do immediate surgery as would other animal hospitals and he was very compassionate about Sabrina even though it was his first time meeting her. Dr. Kwon is an exceptional veterinarian who will care for your dogs or cats as if they were his own. Dr. Kwon and the staff are very helpful and kind. The prices are very reasonable and I highly recommend taking your dog or cat to this hospital if you want the best for them! I will definitely bring Sabrina again to see Dr. Kwon for further treatments!<//Text>

<Review>I have 6 years old Australian Shepherd, Leon. I have been taking Leon to Dr. Kwon since Leon was a pup. Under Dr. Kwon's continued cares and supervisions, Leon has had all his vaccines up to date, without any health or medical issues. All his staff are professional, kind, and informative about services that were provided. Dr. Kwon is very reliable, and provides honest treatment options. Dr. Kwon and his staff will take care of your baby like their own. Best vet cares you will receive, guaranteed :)<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Name>Jieun Kim< /Name>< gmap_id>

This is a great place to take your pets. Everyone in the office is very friendly and the main vet is super nice and you can tell he cares a great deal about animals. He was very compassionate and helpful when are oldest cat passed away. He helped us through the process and was very empathetic. I would recommend them to anyone. We even board our pets there when we go on vacation and they take great care of them while we are away.< /Text>

Today we visited this amazing hospital for my cat. Dr. Kwon is incredibly helpful and is very nice. The place has taken care of our family's cats since 2012. Even when our first cat got cancer, they treated her like family and helped her out to the very end. Our second cat, which is currently a little over a year old and this hospital gave her treatment for good prices. The vet remembers all of the animals that they treat and take care of, and really cares for each one.
10 out of 10 experience, am consistently coming here again.<//text>

We were recommended to this vet by a family friend and we live super close, so we decided to check it out. The staff was incredibly friendly and the facility is super clean. I greatly appreciated their explanation of what our puppy needed and offered a very affordable package in which to do so. I would highly recommend to anyone looking for an affordable and honest vet who cares about "your baby" as he likes to call them. :)</Text>

<text>Dr. Kwon is the best! He really cares for every patient. The detailed visit with great customer service and one on one with a doctor that listens. Other vets just want to leave as fast as possible and you never see them come back. If you love your pet, this is the place its a bit $$ but worth it.

Dr. Kwon is truly the best doctor there is! I am so thankful for all that he has done for my tomcat, Benji and my puppy, Teddy!  On top of being incredibly skilled and knowledgeable, I am always touched by how much Dr. Kwon and the staff truly care about my pets, and always treat us like family!  I don’t usually write reviews, but I HAD to share how happy I am with this amazing vet!</review>

Dr. Kwon and his team are amazing. Petey (adult rescue schnauzer mix) and I have been regular visitors for the past two years. As this is a newly built facility, it has a very jazzed up modern feel. However, beyond the optics, special praise goes to the care and attitude demonstrated by Dr. Kwon and his staff. He sits down with you and explains carefully any issues, the effects of the illness/treatment and following steps. I have never left feeling confused or unsure about anything and they have been very responsive in answering follow up questions or in case of emergencies.

Dr. Kwon and the team have gone the extra mile to to work with my schedule and were often very generous with the services they provided. Through my employer, I had pet insurance. However, when I had difficulties with them (often!), Dr. Kwon stepped up with providing copies of invoices multiple times, getting on the phone with the insurance company and making recommendations on other insurance providers.

Alas, I have moved away from Irvine but I left reassured that Petey would be ok during the travel based on Dr. Kwon's recommendations and prep for the flight. Petey did great and now we are a world away.

Thanks for the wonderful care you provided and best wishes!</Text>

Dr. Kwon and his staff are absolutely wonderful. I have been bring in my two pups for over a year now and I have any nothing put positive experiences. My dogs are a little shy, but they love seeing Dr. Kwon.

They provide a lot of services from vaccines to surgeries (cats and dogs only). I have also brought in my dogs for ear infections and dental extractions. Each time Dr. Kwon and his staff have been stellar in how they handle my dogs. My dogs are a little nervous around larger dogs and they always try their best to make sure my dogs are comfortable in the back and not stressed in the back when they are away from me.

The office is super nice and always clean! Every time I walk in his friendly staff is always there to greet me and check in on how I am doing as well as how my dogs are doing. Everyone treats us wonderfully and is always trying to be as accommodating as possible. Not only the staff are great, but the doctor is too.

Dr. Kwon is a very compassionate and understanding vet. He makes sure he has the time to thoroughly explain what is going one with my dogs and any procedures that. He draws great diagrams on MS paint so that I see all the different things going on with my dogs. He doesn't make me feel dumb when I ask him for clarification or to explain something again. He also never pressures me into any treatments or procedures I feel uncomfortable with.

I don't know what David was talking about when he said the prices where 3x higher than other pet hospitals in the area. I did some price showing before my first visit and his prices were about the same if not less than the neighboring hospitals.

Overall I would give this hospital a higher score if I could. I have nothing but positive things to say. If you are looking for an affordable and caring vet, give Dr. Kwon and his staff a look. You and your pets won't be disappointed.<//review>

First time being here for my kitty Kassy. It was very clean inside like a dust free lab you could imagine from movies. Stuff wa super friendly like previous review said. Dr. Kwon is professional, friendly, and acknowledgeable about what question you could have. The price regarding service was reasonable and competitive compared to others. If you just get a pet or you already have pets this is the definitely the place you should go without doubt<//review>

We came to this spot for dinner. This place was recommended to us by a friend.  Well, it was very nice. The crew welcomed us with a smile and we had an excellent feeling. The meal was tasty. We loved this restaurant a lot and we will visit this place again. Recommended.</Review>

Their window says "beat pizza in Sierra Madre" and they really live up to that claim (there's only 2 pizza places in SM but they're still the best). Their pizza, sandwiches, chicken wings and garlic knots are all to die for. Definitely a comfort food place for me. Take out is easy. You can also eat there, although space is limited (a few tables) it's usually not full.

This used to be a staple when I lived in SM. I since moved away and now it's the only reason I return!<//review>

Best pizza around short of Shakey's Pizza.  they don't continually open the boxes which results in cold pizza like the other pizza places nearby</Review>

<Gmap_id>0x80dcdeea521b9301:0x368851cb1eb0c88d</Gmap_id><review>Ahmed is a magician with the scissors!

I'm originally from New York and after moving to Irvine in 2018, finding a barber wasn't easy.

The cheap barber for $25 will cut your hair in 5-10 mins. A $40 haircut from supercuts or Danckut's is inconsistent because the barber keeps changing and overall not worth the price.

Ahmed's consistent haircut is high quality for only $35! I usually leave with a good tip because he does such a good job!

What attracted me to his shop was the 100+ positive yelp reviews. What kept me coming back was the confidence boost I get from a haircut from Tesoro.

He knows exactly how to style my hair without needing lots of details. After a while, I just ask for the usual and it comes out perfect every time.

Ahmed is a one man show and for good reason. No one can do a better job than this craftsman!

If you're in the Orange county area you MUST visit this man and see the transformation happen before your eyes!<//review>< Pictures>

I am NOT the type to pay over $20 for a haircut. With so many salons closed, I really wanted one and bit the bullet with this $35 haircut and it was worth every single penny. Ahmed is amazing at what he does. During my first visit, I got my eyebrows threaded (he's AMAZING at this) but wasn't ready to cut my hair yet; Ahmed offered to give me a free trim in the back because my hair grows faster there. I returned a second time to get a full haircut with him and was so impressed. His attention to detail and passion for his craft was truly evident when I saw the finished product. I plan on returning to Ahmed for a long time and hope that others check him out too!</Text>

I have been in need of a personal barber for a while and just could not find consistency any where! I am pleased to say I am no longer in search. This shop is simply AMAZING! They over deliver and have a loyal client in myself!! Thanks Tesoro Barber & Salon👑🙏🏾</text>

Ahmed was excellent! I have been looking around for a barber who understands hair and not just how to physically cut hair.  I came in with some messed up previous hair cuts and Ahmed worked his magic bringing me to one of my favorite haircuts in a long time.  It has been 3 days since my haircut and I still catch myself admiring it.  He gets straight to the point and doesn't waste your time. He was also great with scheduling too as I called same day and he made it work for me.< /review>

My husband just started getting haircuts with Ahmed and it’s the best haircut I have ever seen.  Ahmed is incredibly knowledgeable, talented and professional.  We have gone to expensive salons and it is rare to find this quality of haircut anywhere from such an experienced and hands-on professional.< /Text>

Ahmed is amazing. The salon itself is a clean, modern facility and he’s a very easy going guy. He’s very fast, efficient, and gave me a a high-quality cut every time I’ve visited him. Will be going back again; he’s won a loyal customer! He’s a genuinely good guy that works hard and puts his customers first. He takes pride in his work and to top it all off, the price is extremely reasonable for the area!<//review>

Tesoro Salon is one of the best hair salons that I have ever been to. Ahmed is very personable, friendly and nice to talk to. More importantly, the way he cuts hair is very professional and amazing. The prices are fair and the results are always top-notch.<//Review>

I live in Washington DC and did not find the time before a vacation to get a hair cut, so I relied on reviews for barbers near me to find a spot.  I am extremely happy I chose Ahmed's Tesoro Salon.  One of the best haircut's I have received.  He definitely enjoys his work and cares about the final product.  Would definitely recommend to friends.< /Text>

<text>My husband Shawn and I came in on a SUNDAY and we were highly impressed. For one, most salons and barbers aren’t open on Sundays and overall Ahmad knows exactly what he’s doing. His cuts and threading is superb. No better place for a good deal and a kickass look!! This will definitely be our regular place now.</text><user_id>115509680387995971696< /user_id><pictures>None< /pictures></record></dataset><record>

I think the owner, who is the barber, is a very personable person. It was a bit too "personable" for me, although it is better than your average retaining tactics, it is a better form.

I appreciate form. Regardless, good nature and friendliness should never substitute expertise, and boundaries, which on those two, there was a subtle lack.

I called for an appointment, I asked for a time and price, I was quote $30.

I had two pictures with me, but the length of the cut was shorter than on the picture, and the style wasn't what it shows.

I then asked him for a specific cut that is at the length it was, it was a familiar cut for me, and I have been to several locations for it. I know how long, and how many tries it should take for it to be done on skill levels. It took several communications to get close to this basic cut. I'm still going to have to go elsewhere to have it cleaned up a bit.

The entire appointment has already taken some time to complete the cut (despite his talking), and that, was brought up to me when I visited the next night to pay him in cash.

This shop doesn't accept credit cards. I hesitate using checks. It was late and so the decision was to pay him in cash the next day.

He gave me back $5 without me mentioning the price difference when I went back, I gave him back the $5 questioning him why.  I didn't see the price list until now.

I was invited to a demonstration of using wax, which I thought was nice of him. It was a brief rinse, semi-dry and the demonstration of wax over gel. There was also offerings of a string scraping thing for a facial hair found on me. Very nice of him, however expertise and professionalism will win over any gesture, that is, for me, every single time, in a business transaction.</review>

Tesoro, run by the amazing hairstylist, Ahmed, is the best Men’s hair salon I’ve been to. Every time I walk in I am greeted with the warmest of welcomes. He not only does a great job with my hair but he makes me feel comfortable in his studio. Thanks for everything, Ahmed!<//Review>

Update and now 3 years later and still the most rewarding experience and top of the line service.
Excellent top notch service. I have been going to Ahmed now for close to 4 years and what a great experience it has been. Would recommend him to all with no doubt.< /text>

I've been to many barbers in the past 4 years, and by far Ahmed the barber is the best barber in Orange county. I drive all the way from west hollywood to get a haircut. The place is very clean with a nice waiting area, well equipped and uses one of the best shaving tools.< /text>

Usually pretty good, and I understand a scale back because of Covid . I guess maybe I just expect thicker cuts when I'm ordering mishmash, the yellow tail was sliced paper thin and not a lot of fish.< /Text>

<text>Amazing food, amazing service, except the guy taking reservations is a complete (fill in the blank with your favorite insult). After dropping loads of money and right as we were finishing up with a last round of drinks, he comes up and says that we need to leave immediately because we were allowed to stay there only 1hr 15 min. It's a limited space. I get it, but don't keep taking our order and then tell us to leave before we finish them. There are better ways of handling the situation and it's a huge shame that our experience was ruined by one person. But for him, I'd give my experience 5 stars.< /text>< Pictures>

<review>I will definitely be coming back to this restaurant over and over again!
The staff are friendly, knowledgeable and happy to make recommendations if you are unsure of what to choose (the menu is extensive).
My food was impeccably presented and very quick to come to the table, tasted delicious and left me feeling light yet full.
The cocktails are also divine! The Kiwi cocktail is definitely my favourite.
Recommendations- the ahi tuna and the Kobe beef... oh and the grilled squid!!!< /review>< pictures>

<Text>Classic Japanese restaurant / sushi bar that veers more towards fine dining. Good lunch specials.

If you're going to go though you should probably book a table. Weirdly the restaurant is only ever partially full yet they routinely say that there are no spaces available.

If you want to do a "business sushi lunch" then it is probably one of the better options in the neighborhood.< /Text>< user_name>

<text>I hear the lunch specials are good but I came for dinner.  It's more California Sushi.  It was all tasty just nothing memorable.  Portions felt small and more expensive than what you should have to pay considering how competitive sushi is in LA.<//text>< Pics>

<Review>This was my first time at Kiwami.  The food was outstanding and  reasonably priced for sushi.  The atmosphere was comfortable. They were busy but I didn't feel crowded. Service was excellent: they use a team approach and were very attentive. I will definitely go back.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<review>I have no doubt the sushi is probably good here at night. At lunch? Not so much. Ordered a sushi tray and got sushi which I think was kind of old, and didn’t appear that fresh. 5 hours after eating it, and I got food poisoning which confirms it wasn’t fresh. I prefer Teru Sushi next door for quality based on the sushi I tried here :(</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Incredible service and delicious sushi. It’s a bit pricey but worth every penny. There are even options for those people who don’t care for sushi. If you can, I recommend sitting outside.</Text>

First time at this place. The food is good and very clean! there is a lot of light which is nice you can see what you are eating. Most sushi restaurants have no light. The problem was they ran out halibut!!! how do you run out of the best thing on the menu! thats good and bad :) but otherwise everything was delish. The green beans and corn tempura are a must try!< /text>

<Review>I called and asked how long the wait was for a table of four at 8:42pm on 1/21/2017. I was told there was a table open on the patio. I arrived 8 minutes later and the lady told me two tables on the patio had paid but had not gotten up yet. Different story than i was told, but i took her word. 20 minutes later, still no seats.

Several people had left and i saw a table of four open inside the restaurant. I asked her what about that table. She said there was someone in front of me waiting on the table.

So basically, there was no table open at all and i was literally lied to by a place where i was going to spend my hard earned money. I don't leave many negative reviews, but this was ridiculous.

Two of my guests are from St Louis and we have an event to catch tonight. We don't have time to be lied to and deceived. Luckily, i called Teru Sushi next door. They said they had four seats open at the bar. I arrived a few minutes later and what do you know, the seats were actually they're. Thank goodness honesty still exists at some places.

Totally unacceptable. I will never patronize Kiwami solo or with any of my guests. There are too many good options for me to deal with lying and trickery. Integrity is not a switch your can turn on and off. You can't train employees to have integrity with food but not with customers. If they have no honesty and integrity with their customers & will tell a bold face lie over the phone & in person, I couldn't imagine what kind of honor and integrity they have with their food, especially when no one is watching.</Review>< pics>

<Review>They have a delicious sashimi lunch for $20 that hits the spot. The baked hand crab roll is to die for and their Uni is some the best I have had in Los Angeles.The service is excellent unless you sit on the patio you will be waiting for your food for a while.</Review>< pics>

The fish is really fresh, no question about that. It is a bit overpriced and my biggest complaint about the place is that it is too loud! Also, you can't order any alcohol if  you sit in the patio, which is a bit annoying.</review>

<text>This is probably the best out of all the restaurant Katsuya owns. It certainly is the most upscale, especially with its offer of the omakase meal that is pretty extravagant. In terms of the food, it's very similar to the quality of the other Katsuya restaurants. It's solid sushi, but not mindblowingly good sushi like Urasawa or Sasabune. I've been here a few times and tried the sushi, the various handrolls like yellowtail and blue crab, as well as some of the appetizer dishes. In all, it is a place I would recommend. It's not the best sushi restaurant in Studio City, but you can't go wrong here if you want an enjoyable meal with exquisite ambience.< /text>< Pics>

They'll lie and scheme to get your business! I never got to try the food because the hostess was playing games for 40 minutes while we were trying to find a table. The hostess told us she'd hold a table that was already open, and when we arrived said there were people ahead of us. Then she gave us the run around and kept telling us "people paid but i'm not sure when they're leaving." We waited 30 MINUTES!!! Everywhere else was telling us they had a 90 minute wait. However, this place was dishonest. Luckily Teru next door had open seatin at the bar. It was delicious and we had a great time! Even the sake was bomb. We love Katsuya, Sugarfish, Sushi House, and now Teru. Poor Kiwami won't be getting our business. There are way too many good sushi bars on Ventura to deal with petty greed for hungry customers! Oh AND we had plans that we had to push back because of this mishap smh...</review>

I have been to almost all Katsu-ya locations -- Hollywood, Glendale, Brentwood, Sherman Oaks, Encino, and Studio City.

The best and most memorable service at a Katsu-ya has been at their Sherman Oaks location on Sepulveda Blvd. I highly recommend visiting this location as their sushi chefs are friendly, prompt, attentive, and their staff including their manager interacts with the guests. He also offers water to those waiting for a seat.

This Katsu-ya location has the worst service out of all the locations I've been visiting over the past 13 years. They are inefficient and disorganized here.

I left Kiwami tonight without finishing our meal because of their horrible level of service. I should have left $0 for tip.

We left  and visited the neighboring original Katsu-ya Studio City location (and paid for valet again at their neighboring sister restaurant) to finish off our meal including dessert.

I vowed to never return to Katsu-ya if we received the same level of service at the original location.

Reasons for our dissatisfaction at Kiwami (upscale Katsu-ya):

-Gave my sister a pot of hot water instead of tea. I've never seen that before.

-The server called me "sir" when I am a female

-Sushi chef forgot our sushi orders

-The wait for sushi sitting at sushi bar was the longest ever I have ever experienced.  I found our sushi chef was too busy to take care or remember our orders.

-They forgot our edamame

I'd stick to the original Katsu-ya locations in Studio City and Encino. Why pay $1 - $4 or so more for a better atmosphere and lack of service?< /text>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>Already being a satisfied customer of PennyMac Mortgage Services, I applied for refinancing of my mortgage.  The entire process was smooth sailing.  As soon as I submitted my online request for refinancing, their loan specialists got right back to me.  From the beginning the communication was exceptional - I received phone calls and emails from the team on a consistent basis informing me of my application status.  The entire team was professional, courteous, and genuinely interested in coaching me through the process and letting me know what to expect and when the refinancing would finalize.  I especially appreciated that the Closing Team Specialist I was assigned to always called me at a time convenient for me to speak although we are in different time zones. The specialist walked me through the entire process to make sure I understood and reviewed all documents with me before I signed off on the closing documents.  Finally, the entire process moved quickly and efficiently.  I would certainly recommend using PennyMac Loans and I would call upon their services again if the need arises.</Review>< pics>

< Review>
We are very happy about the great home refinance experience we had with PennyMac. The customer service  was excellent, quick and efficient. The electronic system is very well integrated and highly intuitive. We were able to close in a short period of time.

PennyMac made refinancing our mortgage so simple. The process was streamlined, quick and efficient. The customer service we received was fantastic . . . Edna was a gem! She provided us with weekly updates on where we were in the process and answered all of our questions. The notary we met with to go over the final documents was professional, thorough, and also wonderful to work with. Couldn't have asked for a better experience! Thank you!< /Text>

<Time>1601924331444<//Time><name>Marie Rogers<//name><text>The process was so much quicker than expected-about 3 weeks. All of the loan officers and reps I spoke with were very professional. My questions about the fees, points, and closing were clearly communicated and answered promptly. I started working with another company in June and as of September 1, still had not closed. I decided to give PennyMac a call. It was definitely a pleasure working with them. Thank  you Tate and Rene!</text><Rate>5< /Rate><Response>None<//Response></record>

Great experience. Online portal to load requested documents was easy to navigate. Streamlined process. Great communication. Closed within estimated timeline. I would highly recommend that you consider PennyMac for your future mortgage needs.< /Text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Review>So far the worst experience as for a refinance goes. Started the refi back in October 2020 and still have not signed closing documents. Loan officer says 2.5% is the lowest I can get. When I put my information on the PennyMac website price of home, how much I currently owe on the loan and my credit score which I put in the good category which is lower then what my actual credit is and that I’m looking for a VA loan. The site offers a 2.289% offer. Secondly I have been notified by different notaries to schedule a time for signing closing documents each time that appointment was canceled because they never received documents on several occasions...the one time I didn’t sign was because the numbers did not match on the loan so I did not sign and it ends up it was a failure on my mymac team to notify me of the changes. If I could give 0 or even a .5 a star review I would. I bought my first home as a short sale and closed faster then this refi. Also the one excuse I get is Covid which is not a valid reason anymore. I hope people read this and notice all these offers are click bate and never trust these big name mortgage companies. I’m jumping ship first chance I get from them as my mortgage company. (Might even be in a week or so).< /Review>< Pics>

Fantastic communication, I was told that I would be contacted every week throughout the loan process,  and that promise was kept.  Phone calls near the same time of day every day i was suppose to expect a call.  Updates during each phone call were given with easy to understand terms,  and if any paperwork was requested over the phone,  it was clear to which paperwork was needed< /text>

Excellent communication and follow up. I felt as though my needs were as important as their business needs were, which is unusual when working with a financial institution. I felt as though they were working to ensure I received the best deal possible without padding any unexpected expenses.<//text>

The only thing I had an issue with was the closing amount, which was not clearly communicated to me at any time (though I was given estimated closing costs a couple times, that were thousands higher than the actual cost), with the final numbers not communicated to me at all. I had to seek out the Title company myself to get that information. Other than that, while it was a lot of documentation to provide, it went fairly smoothly.< /text>

<review>Process for a VA streamline ReFi was very smooth. Delivered everything as promised. Didn't try to do a bait n switch on rates. Closed a week earlier than expected, which was great. I had my original loan for 5 years before the Refi and never had to call them with an issue. Straightforward business.< /review>< Pics>

I was lost and did not get good communication until Maxwell Mitchell came along. I did not get good information from my loan officer. Emails were not returned, Phone calls were not returned. Finally, i spoke to a supervisor- their rate sheet was down (still waiting on that call to be returned). Max talked me off the cliff and saved the contract. Good work, Max. I wish you nothing but the best!</Text>

That was helpful to be able to understand where we were in the process and next steps. The only part of the process I found frustrating was that when I needed to return his call, which was often due to my work requirements, I was forced to call a 1-844 number and go through teleprompt options and wait on hold. It would be better customer service to have a direct extension to your loan processing team.</text>< Pics>

Few months back I asked if I could refinance our mortgage. I was waiting since then and almost lost hope for approval. But recently it was approved and I am so thankful to Andrew Mortenson PennyMac Loan Services and his team, as well as Merill for helping us through out the months even though there's this pandemic going on. Thank you guys for your patients you guys made it happen. God bless!< /Review>

<text>Their automated system is the worst I have ever experienced. If you try to use their over the phone method of payment make sure your phone is quiet and do not press any of the prompts incorrectly. It asks the same questions repeatedly and repeats the same information over which gets redundant. I have not had a successful month where I have only had to call one time and get it done correctly the first time. I have never felt so defeated trying to give somebody money to make a payment.</text><pics>None<//pics><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

We recently closed our second loan through PennyMac. The first time was just luck but this second time we chose them. PennyMac keeps their loans in house and does not sell them to others which makes for consistent, predictable  loan service. While I am sure all of their associates are gifted and talented we worked with Randall Alford and I couldn't ask for better<//text>

<text>I would have rated it 1 had it not been for the Mgr of Customer Service, Alison Hines-Boney, who was very helpful and understood the importance of the customer's needs.  Ms. Alison's made sure that the problem was resolved by going to the department that has the solution.  Her outstanding customer service stopped me from giving a 1 rating. the
In Oct. 2019, I made a large pymt towards my principal loan but unable to get the new maturity date and the adjusted schedule of pymt even after numerous follow ups with staff and supervisor, until Ms Alison intervened.  With her assistance I finally got the new maturity date and the adjusted pymt sch  on Dec 10th by elevating the matter to another department.  She kept me updated during the process.  Unfortunately, I'm still questioning the accuracy the info generated by their system due to inconsistent maturity date I was given.  I have to chk another app for accuracy.</text>< Pics>

Outstanding company!  From start to finish, the loan process was handled in a very professional manner, and we were able to close on our home right on time.  Pennymac’s representatives (Daniel, Letisia, Jason, and others) are true professionals and made the loan process easier than I expected. Thanks!</text>

I always paid extra money on the same date, sometimes 2 times a month everything went ok for 3 years then suddenly my monthly statement are coming with late fees and one of those showing like i didn't pay, i call and the representative say it will all be fix the following month same situation i call again same answer it will be fix, am calling right now for the 4 time because nothing has been fix, what a waste of my time, whoever gets his mortgage trasfer to this people sooner or later will be facing problems.</review>

That they close at 6PM.
I think it is VERY important to update that- especially for customers calling to make they're payment!!!<//Text>< pictures>

<Text>Tay called my office looking for my manager and she had the worst attitude ever!! I was unable to hear her and when I would gently ask to repeat herself, she was almost screaming at me from her frustration. I asked her for a call back number because MY MANAGER was not available and she HUNG UP ON ME.!! I'm a customer service rep myself and love what i do. If you have no patience, find  yourself a new job Girl. Business will not run good with her horrible customer service!</Text><response>None<//response><Pics>None<//Pics>< UserId.>

The area seems a bit sketchy but man is it worth it. The bakery itself has some of the best pastries I have ever tasted, not over sweet or over produced.

At night there is a taco truck out front which toes just T.J. style tacos. I had the chorizo, adobado, and asada,  each were juicy flavorful and filling. You get your money's worth at this place.<//Text><Response>None< /Response>< username>

Amazing place for quality Mexican breads and Mexican dishes. They even have cake and so many options in the Bakery 😍👍  I’ve been coming here for years and recently moved, now driving the extra miles all the way back to Su Pan bakery to get my fix.<//review>

This place sells more than just fresh bread. Here you can get tortas and smoothies, even chilaquiles. The pastries are great, the bolillos stuffed with cheese or with ham are great, you can even get chocolate covered strawberries. There’s something in the store for everyone. On weekends, I recommend calling in ahead for any food as that is their most popular hours.<//Text>

This place gets all 5 stars for the great food, coffee, and you cant leave without getting some pan. They also have cheesecake and smoothies. Everything is good. We came to try thier tortas and they surpassed expectations. We had the torta chilanga and torta cubana. Full of flavor from your ordinary torta. Highly recommend it. It comes with a side of fries. Plus they serve Cafe de Olla!!! If you dont know, now you know. Come and try it. The bread is always great and fresh. Plus you always want to have pan at home to satisfy that sweet tooth. We always come here for pan but will .wake sure to get a torta as well. The service is great as well and  nice ppl.< /Review>

<Text>The pan dulse and cakes are great and actually taste like Mexican desserts not like the commercial stuff from foodland and kaelins. The tortas are also pretty good.< /Text>< gmapID>

Amazing family staff. Super friendly and always serving samples preventing them from wasting a lot of food. Really clean and love all the pastries and lot of foot traffic in the morning but there are many people also working in the morning so it’s a quick and easy place to get a coffee and pastry under 3 minutes!! They also have great cakes, even though I haven’t tried a whole slice I have tried the sample and it is delicious!!< /Review>

<Text>I needed to order a cake for my friends baby shower. I went a few days before, and the baker and staff were so nice and helpful. She helped me decide on how big of a cake was needed for about 25 people. I sent her pictures of some cake ideas, ended up choosing buttercream frosting with piped vines, and inside vanilla cake with strawberries. It was ready for me to pick up by 10am, it turned out perfect, plus it tasted so good!</Text><response>None</response>< user_name>

When it was time to pick up the cake they gave me a plain simple cake that they keep in the fridge in the front they just wrote happy birthday on it! I was very disappointed. They offered me the money back from the decorations but wanted to charge me full price for the plain cake 25 dollars with the words happy birthday! There buttercream frosting is not good at all. This place is a Joke. If they couldn't have it done on time or at all they should of called and let us know so we were able to find somewhere else.</text>< pics>

<Text>Get ready for your favorite new snack spot! This was one of my first stops when I first moved to San Diego. The cheesecake (or flan?) "sandwich" is worth purchasing every visit, just to let you know.  Delicious tortas, good coffee,  but the obvious stars are the baked treats!  Thick and crunchy pastries, not to mention the cream puffs!< /Text><rate>5<//rate>< pics>

The lovely people who work here are always kind, warm, welcoming, and, full of laughter. They are through and helpful in making sure that the product your looking for is what you receive. If they are sold out of your usual choice they make whole hearted recommendations to new products. I've never had a disappointing interaction or purchase at Su Pan. Every meal exceeds my expectations.  Every time I come here I wish I bought more before I left!!! My favorite breakfast spot and panaderia hands down. Thank you Su Pan :)<//review>

<rate>2< /rate><Text>Service is so-so.
Waited in line while cashiers counted their cash. Never before been to a store where both registers counted cash while customers were waiting. We also had to clean our own table.

Good selection of sweet delights and everything looks good.
We had the Tres Leches (vanilla). Ours was a little too moist and the bottom consisted of a thin chocolate crust which I think detracted from the overall flavour. It was okay but there are better to be found in San Diego. Barra Barra Saloon in Old Towne (San Diego) is better.

Better yet,  make the 7 hour drive to Seaside, CA., and have the absolute best Tres Leches in California at La Tortuga Restaurant. Yeah, I know, it's a long drive. Do you want the best or don't you?<//Text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
We came here because it said online that this was the best Tres Leches in San Diego! I can honestly say that this is absolutely untrue. Hell, this was one of the worst Tres Leches we've ever had. Dry, boring, had very little moisture from milk. Safeway has better Tres Leches! Do not come to this seemingly sketchy part of El Cajon for this abomination in the name of Tres Leches!</Review>

The pan dulce in this place is amazing and is much better than something you would get from foodland or kaelins. I also had a tres leches cake here and it was very tasty and wasn't drowned in milk like in other places.</text>

The best panaderia in this part of town. The cakes...just drool over the awesome selection while you're there. My favorite right now are the chilaquiles with green sauce. The best I've had in San Diego in 20 years. They have a nice modern cash register I'm pretty sure takes Apple Pay and that kind of payments. Usually pretty clean inside, and there's always people sitting down eating. Parking can be tight but it's worth it. Good good good and pan dulce.</Text>

As soon as we walked in I felt welcome with their smiles and friendly service. Their breakfast bolillos are sooo good. It was our first time here and we will definitely be coming back. Only bakery I'll be going to from now on!< /Review>

I made an order by phone about 15 minutes before after I got there I wait like 5 minutes making a line to pay and it turns out that they did not place my order just the cashier was still writing it on a paper and they tell me that if I wanted to order what I still had to wait  about 15 more minutes until the orders of others passed that bad service< /Review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) I always go for a cake and everything has been very good but today I went through some chilaquiles and I think they gave me some nachos with green sauce, the very hard tortilla and only had sauce on top, down the very dry tortilla and for 10 dollars 😠
