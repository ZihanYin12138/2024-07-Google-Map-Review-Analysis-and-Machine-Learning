<Text>My wife and I had the best experience at Mancini’s the other day. Ryan was super helpful and extremely knowledgeable! I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a new mattress. They also have special financing upon approval with 0% interest. Go check them out</Text>< Pics>

I have shopped many times before here and always get good service. Even though I had bought a mattress about 4 years ago I knew what I had bought was starting to bother my back. I talked to Ryan Romero and he was so patient with me. He didn’t push me to get any kind of bed but I knew what I wanted when I laid on it. He was knowledgeable, brought up things I might not have thought about when buying a mattress. He knew his stuff. He really wanted to find exactly what I needed. He was the best and I’d recommend him to anyone who needs to shop for a bed. I do like that Mancinis isn’t a big box store or franchise. It makes all the difference. Thank you Ryan Romero for a great experience.</text>

He was so professional and so knowledgeable with their products and features and he was very pleasant and funny to do business with. It’s been about 15 years since me and my wife bought a new mattress and the first thing Ryan had us do was answer his brief questions about our sleep habits and pains we might have.Then he had us lay on this bed that retrieve the logistics to find a mattress that is  blended for both me and my wife. It was pretty cool and high-tech. Once he had all the options of different mattresses that were compatible for us we went to check them all out. Found the best one, worked out a deal, got an interest free deal on the billing and walked out happy customers. Thanks Ryan, your expertise and experience in this field made it enjoyable experience for us. We know exactly where we will go in the future when shopping for a new mattress.<//text>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
My family has purchased a few mattresses over the years from Mancini’s.  Their service and personnel is always top notch!  Recently, my husband and I were in need of a new mattress.  So, I visited their Dublin location and spoke with Ryan Romero.  He listened to my special Goldilocks needs and understood exactly what mattress options I should try in the store.  Through the process, he was very patient and understanding and answered all my questions.  I was impressed with Ryan, as he was very kind and personable, too.  With his help, I did choose a mattress.  On a side note, I visited a couple other retailers before seeing Mancini's, who were not as knowledgeable.  So, I knew to return to Mancini’s, which is THE best place to purchase your mattress!< /Review>

We arrived at Mancini's 30 minutes before closing on a Wednesday. Ryan took the time to show us a variety of mattresses. We always shop around but find the big selection and great service sets this company apart. Today my mattress was delivered on schedule.
With all the different mattress technologies on the market today it was very valuable to try them out in person and speak with a real pro like Ryan. Keep up the good work!</Text>

There are a ton of mattress stores, but the customer service here is unparalleled. Suni was a joy to work with - patient, knowledgeable, and not pushy. So often in sales, the bells and whistles become the heart of the matter - not in this case, because I articulated my needs and they were heard.
They carry a great selection and will move mountains to do right by the customer.
Start here. It will likely be your last stop.<//Review>

<text>Ryan at  Mancini’s in Dublin was fantastic. We we’re looking at other mattress competitors to make a purchase, but, after talking with Ryan, we made our mind up. We bought our new bed from Mancini’s! He was very kind and helpful with plenty of knowledge in his field. I would definitely make another purchase from Ryan at Mancini’s in Dublin.</text>< rate>

Then she has you try the other two kinds of firmnesses to see how they are, and then back to the first one to calibrate yourself. Then once you know what firmness works best for you, you proceed to try other brands and find out which brand is best for yourself. Definitely would recommend going here if you need a mattress!<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

Ryan romero helped me and my boyfriend buy our first bed together. Ryan was very patient as I have never bought a bed and had no idea what I was looking for. I was like little red riding hood, "this ones too firm, this ones too soft" until ryan found my perfect match that's "just right!" We even decided to get a adjustable foundation to go with our new mattress. Very happy with our purchase!!!! Thanks for the great help and your patience ryan!!</review>

My dad is moving into a care facility on a tight budget.  We had already been to three places and the salespeople were
always trying to explain to us why we needed to spend more money,So we left and
met Craig , we told him our needs he quickly understood what we wanted and
we purchased the Mancini brand at our exact budget,,and gave us some sheets and pillows at no cost,, Thank you Mr Mancini for hiring the type of
person who listens to your customers and has some integrity we will return when my wife and I are ready for our own needs,,

<review>We were in need of a new bed and rather than buy online, (a place I usually go for many items) we actually wanted to touch and feel and try what was available in the sleep arena.  We could not be more pleased with our experience at Mancini's Sleep World in Dublin and cannot recommend this store highly enough.  Our salesman, John, greeted us politely when we entered and then asked us a few questions in order to save us time and point us toward the beds that would best suite our needs.  The selection was immense and as we were putting down a large amount of money on a bed, we were so happy to have been able to touch, feel, and lie on the beds and experience their features, giving us a bit more security in our decisions.  (An added bonus is the four month "sample" period the store affords, really helping you feel secure in your purchase.) After a great deal of sampling, not for lack of comfort, just simply because we wanted to be sure, we finally chose a bed.  Throughout the process, John was always available to answer our questions, yet he also gave us the alone time to we needed to enjoy the beds so we never felt pressured.  The entire process was so easy and actually enjoyable.  Our new bed will be delivered and set up tomorrow, truly an easy, seamless process with a great guarantee!!  I cannot imagine that I had contemplated purchasing a bed online, after the ease of shopping at Mancini's, I now realize what a mistake that would have been.  Thank you John and Mancini's for a better nights rest!!< /review>< pictures>

<review>We went in on a Sunday afternoon and was approached by Suni. She was terrific! Unlike other stores where people breathe down your neck trying to make a sale, she would let us know the info and then step away to give us time to think and consult. We got our hybrid sealy mattress that day, it was delivered and set up later that afternoon and had a great nights rest that evening.

Writing this for my parents. They needed a new bed so they drove to
Mancinis in Dublin met Craig Colli and my mom feel in love ,,she said it was like dealing with an old friend. He was so sweet ,took their time ,found
exactly what my mom wanted ( dad didn't care) and got a great price and
she said it was so easy. plus my mom and dad are Italian and so is  Craig.
either way Thank you Craig for taking good care of my Mom and Dad.
You will see myself and my husband in the near future.</text>

Suni was so knowledgeable, helpful, kind and patient in helping us chose the right bed.  There was no pressure and she worked with us to stay within our budget.<//Review>

it is very bad experience. I have ordered bed frame, mattress and dressing table. The sales guys ordered bedframe set of one size and mattress of another size. on the other hand they delivered the mattress with the hole on the bottom. because of all  this mess, I need to wait at home multiple times  to receive delivery .<//Text>

John and James were awesome! They were attentive to all of my families needs and provided the best customer service. They made our shopping experience easy and made us feel at home. It was the most pleasant holiday shopping we've done so far this year. Thanks guys.< /Review>

Went to Mancini ‘s about 1 month ago in search of a new bed, as ours was giving up the ghost. James came over to us and had us sitting and laying on 6 or so different beds and within 10 minutes helped us identify what we wanted (always a pain for me). James also gave us a good sale price and more. Happily sleeping well on our new bed now. Thanks, James!< /Review>

<text>After shopping at 3 Matt firms we landed at Mancinis Dublin and the
told salesperson we needed space, he granted our wishes after a brief
introduction and he went on his way. We asked questions as needed , he answered quickly and politely and was very easy to deal with. We expressed our concern of the prices he went online showed us Macys and Matt firms deals and do to his patience with us we purchased our first new mattress in
25 years,, Thank you Craig Colli for all you did ,explaining  to us many reasons why to buy from Mancinis a local family owned business, and we did. Craig did a great job,, Thank you again..<//text>< Resp>

We went to the Dublin store today and considered ordering an Aireloom set but couldn’t initially fathom paying that much for a bed. However, the lady in store named Rhonda did an excellent job explaining the long term benefits which made the cost worthwhile.

We appreciated her knowledge and her courteous demeanor even after we decided to shop other stores only to return to buy from her.< /Review>

Was greeted by the store manager, Suni Nutakki.  She is a wonderful person and really knows mattresses.  All the pluses and minuses.  My situation was very special since it was for my wife.  I am the care giver.  I wanted an adjustable bed and a soft mattress.  After laying down on many of them I ended up liking the Tempur-Pedic the best with their adjustable base.  That afternoon I brought in my wife to test them out with me.  I could tell as soon as I got her onto the Tempur-Pedic it was the one.  I said this is it, Suni wrote us up, and then the next morning there were the delivery guys.  3 nights later now and my wife is sleeping like a baby, the whole night through.  Thank you Suni!< /review>

After exhausting  shopping we landed at Mancinis in Dublin,,
needed a new bed for our mom ,, she is picky,and not very patient .
We were greeted by Craig Colli very friendly, not pushy, showed us exactly
what we wanted without any waste of our time by trying to sell us more then we needed or wanted. Told him our budget . we went right to some selections and in 10 minutes we were paying at the counter.
Thank you Craig and Mancinis for hiring people that listen to the customers needs and wants.<//review>

I see several old reviews and I can say the crew there now is not like that. John has been fantastic, not pushy, exceedingly patient and as a family this is the third bed purchase this year. Not only has he been great with pricing, his attitude and customer service ROCKS! Sorry to say I think we are set for another 10 years.< /text>

Best experience ever!! Suni & James were simply amazing.  They were able to help me find the perfect bed for my son & still keep within my budget. There was never any of that hard sales pressure you run into so often.  Not only that, but this was only my 2nd time to the store and they remembered who I was. You can't get any more friendly and personable than that if you ask me.  From now on this is my go to store for all our bedding needs.  I would definitely recommend Mancini's to my friends!  Thanks guys for everything!!< /Text>

Went into Mancinis in Dublin to get a bunk bed and some mattresses. Sales lady named Randa helped me and she was amazing. She was very patient and helped work with my budget. I highly recommend Mancinis they have the best customer service and great products. Will definitely go to Randa in Dublin again!< /Review>

We would like to thank John at the Dublin store for his impeccable customer service he gave us on Tuesday Sept 14th, 2016!

My friend Stephen M purchased an RV that day and needed a mattress that night. We called Mancini's to make sure they were going to be open by the time we could get there, and they were.  We arrived around 8:30 pm and John was ready for us. He showed us our options and proceeded to work with Stephen to make sure he not only got what he needed, but also that he left as a satisfied customer.  John went above and beyond to make sure that happen, and it did!!!
Thank you again John!  Mancini's is fortunate to have you!!

I was a returning customer about to purchase a third bed set, bed, mattress, dresser, until the rep Robert made the experience the worst I have ever had, more so than a car salesperson.

He was pushy to begin with as I recall from 2011, but today was worse. He kept pushing and pushing to close the deal. "Pull the trigger" "Be a man" "it is only $299" "I have a family to feed" language...it was pretty bad. He was going to throw in bean bags, which I didn't need.

Finally he said he would cover my tax, but I had to do it NOW. I asked if I could call him later on or return and he said sure, but it will be 1297 + TAX. I went to the counter and he said is this the right number and address to put the order through. I told him this bed wasn't what my kids wanted, so maybe I could come back in 30 mins or an hour. He said sure, but it would be $1400+. ($1297 + TAX) To end it off, I asked "what difference does it make if I get it now or in 30 or 1 hour?" He said something like "I don't need to do this and have a great day." I turned and left the store and report this behavior to their corporate office.

Keep in mind there was no one else in the store and it was around 12:20pm, not sure why he didn't want to help a returning customer and possibly make a deal.< /Review>

Typical high pressure sales tactics, but friendly. And if you play the negotiation game right, there are nice discounts to be had. Prices tend to be more competitive than Sleep Train, but not quite as good as online.</Review>

My fiancé and I went shopping for a mattress Memorial Day weekend. Chris Berry helped us find our perfect mattress. He was knowledgeable and very patient. We came in multiple days (since this was a big purchase for us) and he address all of our questions and concerns. We had many options when buying a mattress, but we chose here because we got a great value and Chris is an excellent sales man. It was such a pleaureable experience that my parents decided to buy a mattress that same day from Chris as well. We look forward to doing business with Mancini's and Chris in the future.< /text>

I highly recommend Mancini’s Dublin. Had a great experience purchasing a long overdue new mattress. My saleswoman Suneeta was incredibly helpful, efficient & attentive from start to finish. Love my new Tempur-pedic mattress & plan on buying another one for a rental remodel. Ask for Suneeta when you go...great service!<//text>

I purchased a mattress and bedframe, both were not a good quality. Then I tried to return it, and they said no returns for these. I would suggest DO NOT BUY ANY ITEMS IN THIS STORE, They have hidden no-return policy, THIS COMPANY SUCCCCCCCCCCCCKKKKKKKKS. And Poor management.<//text>

< Review>
I was very unhappy with the service I received from this store. The manager I talked to was Rob. I was recommended to speak to the lady manager there, but she was not there when I went in. I tested out several mattresses, and found one that I liked. I was told about their 120 day exchange policy on the mattress, free delivery, 15 yr mattress guarantee, etc. I was then informed that the particular floor model I was looking at was going to be sold and that I could buy it at a considerable cost reduction from the new one. So I went for it. As we were ringing it up, I was then told there was no financing on the floor models. Ok, no problem, pay cash. After the sale was completed, he shook my hand, looked me in the eye, and said "Just so you know, there is no exchange and no warranty on the floor models." The sale was final. I wouldnt have purchased the mattress if I had known I wasnt going to get the perks that come with buying a new mattress. Manufacturers sell their products to many sales locations, people make customers come to their store. I hope no one ever goes to this store for their own good.< /Review>

<Text>Came in for a memory foam bed. Suni  helped me pick one that fit my needs. Turned out memory foam was not for me. I decided to try the adjustable frame and a nice comfy mattress. Suni showed me three different mattress knowing I was on a budget. I found the perfect fit. Suni gave me a good deal. Why  do I keep coming  back to this dublin store, because Suni is real and honest.

She did not take me to the expensive beds first, she took me to what I could afford. Never tried to pressure me to buy an expensive bed like most places do. She worked with me to find the best mattress on my budget.  I want to also thank John for going out of his way to make sure I got my adjustable frame sooner. My bed arrives tonight and I can't wait. Thank you Suni for helping me find my dream bed without breaking my budget.  It was not about making a sale but helping someone sleep good.  Thank you..<//Text>< rating>

Awesome service! Thank you Joseph and your team for everything! My refinance wasn’t an easy one but you and your team work hard and endlessly to get it done for me. I work 2 jobs and have to handle a newborn baby and you made my refinance painless and less stressful. Thank you again for all your help.

He gave us all the information we needed to make a decision and was not at all pushy. We got a great rate for our refinance and the whole process was seamless. As well as being a great loan officer, Patrick also supports the veteran community and donates a portion of his commission to veteran housing organizations, which is awesome.

<time>1621631600765<//time><rating>5</rating><Review>With mortgage rates dropping so low in the past couple of years, I have used SELFi twice now to refinance.  Both experiences were painless, transparent, and surprisingly quick.  Joseph and Kevin are passionate and will go to bat for you in the process.  They also provide really impressive rates, and when comparing with others, i found SELFi often had better lender credits at no additional cost compared to the same interest rates at other companies.  Of course, these other companies will tell you that they'll match better offers, but I'd prefer to skip that nonsense and work with someone who gives me a great price without making me negotiate.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<Text>Joseph responds very quickly even I never talked to him over the phone or met him personally. He was very professional. He helps me to finished the refinance mortgage loans at the best rate. (3.5% to 2.5% 30-year fixed). It takes only one month from start to finish. he was one step ahead in the process and answers all my questions. I really recommend him and working with him again. Thank you, Joseph, I appreciated your help.< /Text>< pictures>

Joseph was a pleasure to work with on my refinance and got me the best rate after I checked several other lenders such as better.com.  He made the process clear and straightforward and was always quick to respond to a couple of questions I had by email.  Almost entire process was done remotely except for 10 minutes to sign required documents with notary safely with masks on my front porch.  Almost all documents were able to be e-signed.  Joseph also covered the cost of extending the rate lock for an additional week after there were some unavoidable delays due to my work HR department and homeowners association being out over the holidays.  Joseph helped save me a lot of money and I highly recommend!<//Review>

Your one stop shop for all your refinance needs. Joseph was professional, organized, and patient in explaining everything to me. This is definitely one of my most pleasant refinance experience (I've done a few others before). The online portal for document submission was very convenient and everything went by very fast. I got the absolutely best rate on the market. SELFi is the best.< /text>

<text>I worked with Stacy Mitchel for my home loan refinance. She was very professional and did her best to answer your questions ASAP help you to communicate with loan underwriting.  I would like to work with her if I have any loan applications in the future, it will save a lot of headache to deal with loan underwriting.

PS I like SELFI website for documents viewing and down/uploading.< /text>< Pictures>

Worked with a lot of mortgage lenders and brokers in the past, but Joseph is one of the best. Very hardworking, timely and professional.

More than everything he is very organized and his system to keep things organized is great. He is also super patient in explaining how things work.

He saved us a lot of money by finding one of the best deals in the market, right when we gave up hopes that we can't refinance and its not for us< /Text>

Of all of the refinances I've done, working with SELFi and Joseph was by far the easiest and the one in which I felt most confident that I was getting the right outcome for myself. I left the experience feeling more educated about the refinance process and appreciate the helpful answers to my questions along the way. Highly recommend and will come back to SELFi for future needs.< /Text>

<review>The wife and I were dealing with another refinance officer when we noticed several red flags of issues concerning her integrity. We decided to contact a good friend who turned us over to Pat and let me tell you, that was the smartest decision we ever made! Pat Dolan is honest and holds his clients best interests as his number 1 priority!  We saved over 3k with Pat and our percentage was lower then what we had been offered! Pat is personable yet always professional and I can’t tell you how fricken lucky we were to have him secure our refinance! If you want honesty, integrity, trust and relentless dedication then Pat Dolan is where your gonna find it!! —Your amazing Pat! Thankyou for rescuing us!< /review>< Pics>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>I was a little skeptical of the concept of Selfi. Refinancing can be a consuming task, and I was concerned about not meeting a broker in person; however, based on the reviews and my perception that my refi situation was pretty straightforward, I decided to give Selfi a chance. Now that the process is complete, I'm thrilled. The result was an embarrassingly low-interest rate, very reasonable closing fees, and a new lender that looks to be easy to work with. It took a little longer than I'd expected, but I assume that has to do with how many folks are refinancing now. I worked with Erica, and despite the longer than anticipated runway, she kept me informed and maintained my rate lock weeks past the expected closing date. Again, my loan situation was pretty straightforward. I don't know what this process would be like for a more complicated loan, but I would 100% recommend this service to anyone who thinks they have an uncomplicated loan and good financial documentation. The entire process was very manageable, and for me, the result is an outstanding loan with a great rate and savings that will make a huge difference every month for years to come! Thank you, Erica and Selfi!<//Text>< Date>

<Review>I was so happy to find SELFi after spending several weeks researching rates and comparing quotes from multiple lenders and brokers. From the very first interaction I felt confident that SELFi was the right choice. The online application was completely transparent and super simple, Joseph promptly followed up to discuss my refi needs and provided expert guidance on loan options, and the rate and fees easily beat all of the other quotes I received from competitors. We closed quickly despite a delay on my end, and the entire experience was incredibly convenient! Highly recommend SELFi!<//Review>< pics>

<review>We came across SELFi while researching rates and lenders after having already started the re-fi process with another lender, which we were having a horrible experience with.  Can't say enough how glad we were to find Joseph and give SELFi and chance and ultimately choose them as our lender.

Joseph was so responsive to all of our questions and correspondence.  He always replied quickly to us and we never felt like he was rushing us or pressuring us to make any decisions.  We appreciated that so much of the process could be handled online, digitally - no faxing or in-person steps, and no one in our house until closing.  The entire process was very easy and we closed quicker than we thought we would.  SELFi also offered us the best rate and a loan option that we felt worked best for us.

We will definitely be referring Joseph and SELFi to everyone we know that might be in the market for their services, and look forward to working with Joseph in the future.  Thank you, Joseph!</review><rate>5<//rate><Name>Carrie Villanueva< /Name>< resp>

SELFi are really responsive and got me a much better rate than any others. I was currently doing a refi via a bank which had started in July, hadn’t closed by November and was now an uncompetitive rate. Within a week with SELFi I was closing on a better rate. These guys are so proactive, better than any of the other mortgage brokers I’ve used by far and you’d think going direct to a lender would get you a better rate. Not true. SELFi got the best rates for me by far, a huge difference. I don’t normally write up reviews but I think this is worth it given just how good their service is. Simply awesome, if you can, it’s definitely worth you checking them out. SELFi are now clearly my first choice.</Text>

<text>Was really happy with my experience with Joseph @ SELFI..First off he was sending correspondence with me up until 11pm so I could lock the rate that I wanted within the 12am deadline. My loan was a little more complicated since I had a 2nd home but Joseph explained exactly what was needed, worked with the underwriters and kept the communication going to I was able to close on my loan (with a great rate:). I am a happy client and would recommend SELFI to anyone for their financing needs.</text>< pictures>

<rate>5</rate><Review>Selfi offers a winning combination of low rates and easy execution. Joseph, our mortgage broker, was super responsive and communicated clearly. In addition, Selfi's application portal was easy to use and allowed for our documentation to be uploaded securely - no emailing sensitive information back and forth. Selfi paired us with Quicken Loans, and the lender - as well as the lender's settlement service Amrock - were also easy to work with: many of the loan docs were signed electronically!

If you're looking to refi at a great rate, I'd highly recommend Selfi.<//Review>< pictures>

Working with Joseph and his team was great. They not only found us the best rates anywhere, but they were also super responsive, took time to walk me through all the scenarios, gave great advice, and were always 100% ‘on top of it’. The process was simply, seamless, and they even moved up our close date when we requested to. Thank you Joseph, Dalton, and the Selfi team!! Hugely appreciated your help and working with you!<//text>

Just close my refinance few days back. Was looking to refinance my home loan. I was shopping around. Got estimate from other companies and initially went with better.com as they were giving me better rate and credit. I gave deposit to better.com; but even after 2 weeks they did not do appraisal. In the mean time, Joseph contacted me and offered me lower rate and higher credit. I accepted that offer and moved to Selfi. The offer was compensating my deposit with better.com and giving me lower rate. The very next day, appraisal for my property was done. It took 3 weeks to close, after I accepted the offer (better.com did not do my appraisal even after 2 weeks). Throughout the process, Joseph was so responsive and made it smooth. He is honest and will not hide anything from you.
The best part during this refinance process was, everything was done right from our house. The closing agent came to our house and took our signatures :). I would highly recommend Selfi to anyone looking to refinance their loan. For those, who are thinking twice about online refinancing, I would suggest them to do refinance online. It will not only save your time, but also you will get better rate.<//Text>

Overall a really easy and quick experience.  It was difficult getting quick responses from Dalton or Joseph so you will need to be patient when trying to get immediate answers to questions.  There were also a few hiccups with the rate lock but Joseph and Dalton made it right by ensuring I received the credit and rate I requested to lock.  I especially appreciated the hybrid closing which allowed for as little wet signatures with the Notary as possible.<//Text>

I worked with Erica Zepko. She was knowledgeable and attentive to my overall financial goals. She offered the lowest rates from the start and kept me locked me in at a great rate despite the settlement company, Amrock, dragging on the signing, not following instructions, and missing deadlines.  Erica was transparent with all my options and allowed me to choose the way I needed to structure the loan to meet my goals. She was responsive and made the process as easy as possible. I would highly recommend Erica at SELFi.</text>

<review>One of the best refinancing places I happened to deal with. Happened to get my refinance via SELFi and Joseph was very responsive for the questions I had. Finally he got locked at a much lower rate and ZERO closing costs. All went very smoothly until we had to sign in front of notary. Unfortunately the same day California placed a Shelter at home and despite notary had the appointment scheduled it was cancelled. But Joseph worked his magic and the same week notary came home and got papers signed and the loan was closed.
Mind you despite the Fed lowering interest rate, mortgage rates were climbing. Thanks Joseph.</review><gmapID>0x8085813089d5a033:0x551a708b9b8cce50<//gmapID><response>{'time': 1589909643066, 'text': 'Thank you Tahseen and congrats on your SELFi refi!'}<//response><user_id>110792710195561873511< /user_id>< user_name>

I had all ready contacted other loan sites for refinancing quotes, when I came across the Selfi site. This site clearly explains the the ins and outs of obtain a loan and refinancing, especially what all those add-on loan fees mean.  I really dislike those low loan rate advertisement which have greedy absorbent fees tacked on.  This is not the case with Selfi and Joseph and his team.  To keep this short, read the other reviews.  What is being said is true.  Everyone has different requirements and Joseph can find the loan that is best for your requirements.  My requirement was to refinance my current principle and 4% 30-year loan rate to to the lowest rate and keep the closing cost as little as possible.  I was hoping for a loan rate in the low 3's.  Guess what?  I got a loan rate at 2.77% 29-year (a monthly special by Quicken) and my closing cost were $803 after a $707 credit.  The savings in my monthly payment will cover my loan cost in less than 3 months.  Am I happy?  You bet!  Joseph and his team made this possible.
Check out Selfi and I hope you end up as happy as I am.< /text>

<text>Lending standards for self-employed persons changed in the middle of the review of my application, due to COVID-19. Additional documentation was requested, and review was much longer... the refinance took about two months to complete. During this time I was kept apprised of the situation by Dalton and Joseph every week. They advised me to wait for a 15 day lock on my interest rate and that worked out great for me, as interest rates went down 1/4 percent while we waited. Closing costs were a lot less than my last refinance, and I am a happy camper. I would definitely recommend SELFi to others.< /text></record></dataset><record>

<time>1595270672139<//time><Rating>5< /Rating><Review>Joe is very clearly a long-tenured, highly prompt and professional operator in the loan brokerage business. SELFi's approach to refinancing is no-nonsense, provides immense added value in its simplicity, and achieves the best result possible with minimal effort.

SELFi doesn't hide current rates behind lengthy information gathering forms or force you to pick up the phone (which is already ringing constantly with tons of unwanted spam calls from other lenders) to get a quote. The rate I was initially quoted was the same rate at closing. Oh and did I mention? That rate was a full twenty basis points lower (!) than the next best rate I could find out there after an extensive search. We are tremendously grateful for the smooth experience, and so happy that we discovered SELFi before locking in with another lender. Highly recommended and will definitely be sending friends to you.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>{'time': 1595281635922, 'text': 'Thank you Dan and congrats on your SELFi refi!'}< /response><GmapID>0x8085813089d5a033:0x551a708b9b8cce50< /GmapID></record>

If you are trying to find the lowest rate and fees for a mortgage refinance, you must use SELFi.com! I had the most amazing lending experience with them. My loan closed in less than 8 working days from when I submitted my online application. I got the lowest rate I could find. It was probably 0.5% to 1.0% less than other companies, which makes a huge difference in interest paid over the loan. Both Dalton and Joseph were extremely responsive, I got replies within an hour or two each time. Very low closing costs. The best thing about this experience is how transparent the rate/fees/etc are before you even apply, which is super important so you're not getting lots of hard credit pulls from multiple lenders. Also, other companies I've worked with in the past have not been very transparent, then you get to the end, and discover higher fees/rates/etc. I cannot recommend these guys enough. I'm hard to impress and cynical, so I wouldn't be writing this review if I didn't fully endorse their product and service. I rely on reviews! The refi DIY information on their website was great also. Thanks guys! I'm now saving $1k per month and have the lowest rate of anyone I know!</Text>

Dalton Dillender helped me throughout the process, he helped me find the best fit for me to reach my goal. The website is so easy to use and every time I have a question, Dalton is just an e-mail or a text away. How convenient is that?! I highly recommend this company.

My wife and I were looking to reduce our interest rate and lower our monthly payments on our Mortgage. Once we decided to go ahead and refinance, Joe kept us up to date on the daily fluctuations of the rates and made understanding the process simple. He answered all of our questions in a timely manner and spoke with us on the phone many times throughout the process when we requested it. We ended up lowering our monthly payment by $400 a month.

Thanks Joe & SELFi!< /Review>

While shopping for rates for a refinance, I came across SELFi. In addition to a great rate and pricing, Joseph was available throughout the process to answer any questions we had and guide us from filing our application through closing.

Due to COVID-19, we were able to get our appraisal waived, and the closing was completed in a way that made us feel safe.

His commitment to service was a big part of why I chose SELFi for our refi, and I wholeheartedly recommend this service to others.

Thanks, Joseph!</text>

I spent months searching for a company that could offer refinancing with zero or little upfront costs. I considered going with companies like lending tree, better.com and of course the usual big banks and credit unions but quickly realized that I'd be in a world of a mess with spam and credit inquiries after reading through hundreds of reviews. I finally stumbled upon Selfi and loved how transparent the website was. There wasn't much reviews so of course I was a little hesitant but it didn't take long for me to have some faith. I decided to plug the trigger and just inquire through the website to see what it was all about (no credit pull, or application submission yet). I immediately received a response from Joseph in less than 15 minutes. Aside from the response time, I was more intrigued with the fact that Joseph wasn't your typical online sales rep with a noisy background and script-like responses. I loved the fact that Joseph never pushed me to pull my credit or submit any details during our initial conversations, he actually took the time to understand my situation - what I think my credit score is, what I want or plan to do and of course what I'm more comfortable doing. After a few conversations with Joseph I decided to pull an official quote to get a better idea of the numbers. Joseph got back to me in less than 2 hours after I submitted my information and gave me his recommendations. I informed him that I'd need to shop around for due diligence and he of course was more than okay with that. It took me about 4 days to finally come back to Joseph and proceed after comparing with over 8 FIs, CUs and other refi companies. Fast forward and in a nutshell, I got GREAT rates and terms, primarily dealth with Joseph through email (which I love), was given clear and concise details on all the steps involved, enjoyed the fully digital experience of this refinance, never had to leave my house and best of all - I WAS PAID to refinance! I'd highly recommend Selfi to anyone that wants to refinance their mortgage without all the BS. Joseph, thank you so much for your patience and understanding with my refinance. I appreciate all the knowledge and effort you shared, especially since this all happened right when COVID started.< /review>

This Google listing enabled me to buy an investment property in a CRAZY market, at under market rate--Joseph is a miracle worker!

I work for myself so don't have W-2's to *legitimize* my finances. I looked around for almost 3 years before I was able to find someone who was NOT a hard money or *portfolio* lender wiling to give me a loan.
I was used to being quoted 5.8-7% interest, so when Joseph came in with a rate in the 4's, I frankly didn't believe it.
Though he was VERY responsive and patient, my realtor and I still couldn't believe that he could get rates FROM Quicken, UNDER what Quicken quoted me directly, so we were wary of the whole process until it came through.

Seriously. I don't know if anyone knows what it's like to HAVE money, but to not be able to SUBSTANTIATE the money, and though doing so required a lot of paperwork, it all went as smoothly as anyone could've hoped.

Because my house purchase was *unique*, the close had to happen quickly, and we contacted him FIFTEEN business days before we needed to close, AND over the holidays (Nov19-Dec-12) and he made it happen with a day to spare and we closed EARLIER than our agreed upon date.

Now I wouldn't recommend going to him last minute like I did, because I'm sure I was a NIGHTMARE client (SO much paperwork, SO MUCH back and forth to legitimize my finances), so if you're just a *regular* person in search of a loan, you've found your Unicorn in SELFi!

Thanks Joseph!!</text>

It was a pleasure working with Joseph and SELFi. I had started the refinance process with Better.com a few weeks prior to finding SELFi. Right off the bet, SELFi’s rates were lower. My plan was to go to the finish line with both vendors (Better.com and SELFi) to see which would have the best offer. At the end of the day, I was able to use the SELFi offer to negotiate down the rates on Better.com. Even though there was already sunk cost with Better.com for an inspection, I decided to go with SELFi. The reason was that the experience with Joseph was a lot more personal. There was no waiting around wondering when the next step in the process would happen as Joseph kept me informed every step of the way.  I have already recommended SELFi to a few friends looking to refinance. Great experience!</Text>

<Text>I had been putting off refinancing my mortgage because I didn't want to deal with the hassle. Joseph at SELFi could not have made it easier. He was very responsive to all my emailed questions and explained everything with a satisfying amount of detail. About 45-ish days after I first contacted SELFi, I closed on a refi that lowered my interest rate, monthly payment, principle, and length of the loan.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

<pictures>None< /pictures><user_name>A</user_name><Review>I just finished my refinance with SELFi and was very, very happy with the experience. As a point of reference, this refinance was my 5th full, new or refinanced mortgage experience in the last 20 years.

Joseph and Dalton of SELFi were very responsive and available via email, text, and phone as needed. Their site has a lot of great information and something I wish I had available with my previous four mortgage experiences.

Most importantly to myself and probably anyone else trying to figure out who to work with on a new or refinance mortgage, SELFi clearly has the best possible rate/pricing on rates. In fact, I started my refinance process this time around with Better Mortgage, but then a couple of weeks into the process, I discovered SELFi through a Google search.

SELFi's pricing on rates were significantly lower/better than Better Mortgage and any other site I looked at like Amerisave which I had used in the past. It was clear to me that SELFi, as a smaller organization, has a lot more flexibility and ability to be responsive to individual needs and goals than a large organization like Better Mortgage which has standard rules they are required to follow regardless of one's specific situation and refinancing goals. On top of all that, SELFi's application and approval process was much more streamlined, simpler, and faster than Better Mortgage and Amerisave.  As a specific example, although I'm sure it is dependent on property address, credit score, and assets, SELFi didn't require an appraisal for our refinance, saving us over $500 on fees.

Thanks Joseph and Dalton! I highly recommend SELFi for anyone interested in a new or refinance mortgage. They are clearly, by far, the best option out there!</Review><UserId.>102374808135075357689</UserId.>< rate>

I had tried to Refi directly with Quicken and they denied me. When Joseph contacted me he was confident he could help me. At first I was doubtful, but Joseph was very committed to delivering what he promised and even exceeded expectations. The process was all done online and via email and was so seamless I still can’t believe it’s completed. I will definitely use Joseph and SELFi again and would highly recommend him and SELFi to anyone.< /text><userid>111856436794801015329<//userid><Pics>None< /Pics></record>

<text>I came across Joseph and SELFi while researching another discount mortgage broker.
I have always gone the traditional route when buying or refinancing and was a little exhausted by the process. I was intrigued by SELFi's  claim that they could beat most any rate as I thought the company I was looking at was making a really good offer and had great reviews themselves. Not only did Joseph beat the rate, but he did it with negative points, giving me a free refi and getting a little cash back.
The process was quick and painless. I had many questions, this being my first internet mortgage experience. Joseph answered them quickly and professionally. In just a few short weeks I was sitting with a closing agent in the comfort of my own home. I lowered my rate by .5125 points on a loan I had just closed on a few months prior.
I would have no problem referring Jonathan and SELFi  to my closest friends and family!< /text>< pictures>

I learned of Joseph because of my son-in-law, who had recently refinanced their home through Selfi. Both my son-in-law and I are in the mortgage industry, and  Joe’s rates beat even our own ‘Employee Loans’ rates. But the rate is only a part of the transaction. The communication, follow through, ease of the process, and on-time closing all made working with Joe enjoyable and stress free. I would definitely endorse him and Selfi. Jim R.<//text>

<review>Just closed on a refinance with SELFi. Great experience, super easy, and saved a bunch of money.

I had open applications with 4 lenders just because that's what you're "supposed to do" and what we had done last time. I found selfi last, and completed everything first thanks to Joseph. Of the other applications, 2 were (far) more expensive in both rate + closing costs, and 1 just moved so slowly it was like pulling teeth (they ended up wanting 60 days to close after all that so I'm glad).

It's too bad we only have one condo because I'm very much looking forward to working with selfi again in the future.<//review>< Date>

This is my second refinance with SELFi and Joseph. The service and the rate is the best. I was offered a great rate without any negotiations or discussions. I did shop around for better rates/deals, but no one can match what SELFi offered. Joseph provided a list of required documents at the beginning, which was very reasonable and no additional documents was required. Lender paid almost all the loan costs, which was great! Initial rates and costs were not changed at closing. From application to closing only took just over 2 weeks. The total experience was very satisfying and I would recommend SELFi for anyone looking for mortgage/refinance.< /Text>

If you are ready to refinance,  stop looking and go with SELFI, you will not find a lower rate or better service anywhere else. Believe me, I shopped around with well over 10 lenders that swore that they would get me the best rates and JG Wentworth even guarantees it, but they couldn't even come close. The best advantage of using SELFI, is that you can search the rates your self and see what they look like daily, and when you're ready all you have to do is tell Joseph you want to lock in that rate. No other lender publishes their rates daily and I just closed a loan at 3.5% and only had to pay $100 to close. No other lender could come close to that! Thanks SELFI!</Text>

<Text>As others have attested to, working with SELFi was awesome! I was looking to refinance, and SELFi provided me with many options. The broker I worked with directly, Joseph Flannery, explained all of the factors to consider when choosing to either 1) pay points for lower interest rates, or 2) cover closing costs, with a lender credit, for higher interest rates. We played scenarios to the end many times, and Joseph was very patient when I had many questions, including some I asked two, three, or four times to make sure I understood his response and the different financial implications of potential decisions. Most importantly, working with SELFi resulted in getting the best interest rate for the best price -- by far! I ended up closing with Quicken. While working with SELFi, Quicken reached out offering to refinance directly (without SELFi serving as a broker). Here's the kicker - the rate I was offered through SELFi was much lower than that the rate Quicken offered directly (I believe it was .5% lower). And I payed less up front! In other words, I was able to receive a lender credit to cover some of my closing costs, and still received a lower interest rate that Quicken was offering me directly, and their direct offer did not include a lender credit. Working with SELFi was truly the best home buying/refi experience I have had, and I highly recommend working with SELFi if you are looking to purchase or refinance!<//Text>< Pictures>

<Text>I always say that buying a house is one of the most stressful things you can do in your life, not only because it is a huge life choice and change, but also because nobody in the process cares about the deal as much as you do. For the agents, brokers, banks, and title companies, they do this every single day and it's easy for a buyer to feel like another sheet of paper in the stack.

I had this exact experience with SoFI and Better Mortgage who both “pre-approved” me, assured me I should go and place offers on properties, and then when my offer was accepted were both completely unreachable. After days of phone calls, I was later assured separately and by both lenders that I would never qualify for a mortgage due to my self-employment.

After almost giving up on the whole process, I found SELFi on Yelp and reached out to Joseph. He had an underwritten pre-approval for me within a couple days and got the deal done when nobody else could. In addition, he was super responsive, easy to get in touch with, and easy to work with. I cannot more clearly state my confidence in SELFi and enthusiasm to recommend them to anyone.<//Text>< Resp>

<text>We’ve worked with a few different mortgage companies and brokers over the years, and Joe at SELFi was hands down the best. Not only was he thoughtful, kind, responsive in keeping our refi process on track and answering our many questions, but he delivered on SELFi’s stated promise of saving us money with lower rates … saving $4,000 at closing and in the range of $50,000 over the life of our loan with our reduced monthly mortgage bill. He’s a breath of fresh air – a financial professional with his heart (not greed) in the right place to help the average person pay less. I’ve already started recommending SELFi and Joe to friends, family, and co-workers looking to refi or buy a home.</text></record></dataset><record>

My mom and I came here just to get two simple full sets, nothing crazy. Right away they start asking if we want gels, we both say no. I had to keep telling her that I want them shorter and she told me well if you go shorter it's still the same price which is 45 dollars and I was just shocked cus I've never spent that much on nails. Usually when you go to nail salons they have their prices on board or something so you could see what their prices are, this place has nothing so your going in blind. My mom and I walked out spending 85 dollars, which to us is to much for our nails. I know some people might think that's not a lot of money but to us it is. We will not be coming back here, we will take our business somewhere else<//Text>

I've been coming here for 15 years. They're all great. You can check them out on IG @nananails_and_spa

They get busy so I would suggest you call first or make an appointment.</text>

<review>This place is awesome. Tom always does my nails perfectly & they last for so long. Definitely getting the most bang for your buck. It is always packed however so try to make an appointment to avoid waiting for a really long time. Only nail salon I go to.<//review>< Pics>

<text>No stars! But can't post. Rushed the entire time. She cut me really bad while trying to remove prior set,  kept cutting me while "trying" to file and smooth nails. Mostlt all nails are crooked, bubbly and bumpy. Tiffany was was rude the entire time, she was rushing to leave as I was her last client.. which I had made the appointment early morning.. They agreed nails were bad and asked me to go back. Never going back.</text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dcd65af7b3b22f:0x39812cb7801f84df<//Gmap_id></record>

<Rating>3<//Rating><text>I do enjoy going to Nana Nails because they have great nail artists. Cindy and Tee and my favorite girls to go to for acrylics because their shaping and designs are on point! Something unprofessional about this place is how they up charge and constantly change prices without telling you. My first time going here I was charged almost $100 for a new set, which I loved but I feel it would’ve been more professional to have a receipt or proper breakdown of why I was charged for that. Changing prices constantly without a heads up  to charge people more is morally wrong...<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x80dcd65af7b3b22f:0x39812cb7801f84df< /GmapID></record>

I love going to this nail salon. It's always busy but it's so worth the wait. Everyone does such great nails. I got mine done by Tom, whose the owner, & I just happened to pull a picture of the nails I wanted on Google & he looked at it for a second & instantly he got to work. He was so fast & thorough & the nails were seriously strong & the perfect length cause I type all day at work & these don't slow me down at all. Only downside is they're more expensive than other local places but you are getting exactly what you pay for. Went a couple weeks later to get my fill & again I had a great time. I'llll definitely be going back again.<//text>

I will not be coming back to nana nails because they literally rip you off I told Christy the nail tech I only wanted one design and this B put designs on all my nails and she had the audacity to charge me $95 and honestly no one told her to do all those designs when I specifically said I only wanted one and the design came out horrible on 4 of my fingers they lost a customer that loved the place until they all started messing up.< /text>

Pretty pricey for a simple set. I brought in a picture and the front desk lady said it would be $45. The nail tech I got was a man and was very rough with me and seemed annoyed. When he asked if the length was okay I said to go shorter and he kept insisting to keep it that length. When he brought the color of samples he shoved them in my face and when I chose a color he said another one would look better and went with his choice. He twisted my fingers a lot and pulled on my hands and arm and hurt me really bad when he was filing down the powder. I told him it was hurting and he laughed. When he was finished he told me it would be $55 because of the length even though I said I wanted them shorter so I told him the lady said $45 so he knocked it down to $50. Once I left and looked at my nails there’s bumps in the gel and there’s some parts that aren’t filed down properly and some that are way too filed. Will NEVER come back again.<//review>

Went in for a pedicure, came out with bloody toes. Ann performed my service. She was very rough with the cuticle nippers. Really dug in there resulting in bloody toes. She would look up to see my reaction every time she tugged on the skin. I would look at her in shock because WTH! She just went about the service. When I got to my event I looked down and noticed the crusty blood. It was not only painful but so embarrassing.  I also came in with a scrape on my shin which she rubbed VERY VIGOROUSLY with body scrub. Im cringing. NEVER AGAIN. HORRIBLE. Minus stars if I could.<//Text>

First of all I had black nails done with three diamonds going down on my ring fingerwhen I went to go get new nails done to take the old ones off instead of using that one chemical and wrapping my finger with foil they decided to get one of extensions do it in between and underneath the fake nail they peel them off was in extreme pain nails didn't even come out the ones I wanted I wanted the mat and dark came out well you can see the example doesn't even look nothing like the what what I wanted pay $65 even though the black once costed me 60 in the previous ones before that cost me 55 so I don't know what's going on every time I go back they're charging me more and more and more if anybody wants good nails done you should go to the one on la Palma and State college doesn't look as professional but they do them very well been going there for years with my other cousins but I decided to give this one a try first two sets came out awesome last it's just a nightmare do not consider people going their very expensiveI also remember when I first called in with told me it was going to be 35 the first time comes out to be 55 and also about the black meals I got 1 broke as soon as I got home< /text>

Came in to see a tech who had done a wonderful job on my nails the last time I went in...I knew coming in on a Saturday was going to be a problem she rushed through my nails and did not communicate properly on what she was doing to my nails hence nails came out looking terrible and on top of that put a bunch of rhinestones on my nails I didn’t ask for and then tried to charge me 20.00 for them last time I came I’m she charged me 55.00 dollars and 5.00 for rhinestones surprise 75.00 dollars this time that’s not how you do business taking advantage of people  and too top it off woman at front desk told me to not come back again...no problem way way better nail shops where I live!</Text>

And be careful because they like to add things without telling you and when ur done it's over a 100$ just make sure you are straight up and specific when u start</review><date>1532987494823< /date>< Rating>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Review>Ultimately the final judgment & opinion which becomes everlasting in one's mind comes from the final product and your experience during any visit to a service business.
I came to get a pedicure, no big deal. While getting my toe nails clipped a young Asian lady was doing mine and she was clipping my cuticles, she dug into the sides of my big toe to get the sides clean and it hurt really bad.  I said softly, "that really HURTS", she continued, then my toe proceeded to bleed. She put some liquid on it and wiped it, but it continued. I think she put that oily stuff that makes your cuticles not look dry.  Then she did the other foot and dug into the side of that toe and I jerked my foot away. She completed my pedicure and I asked for a holly leaf to be painted. I showed her a pic and she did it.  They looked good but the next day (Thanksgiving Day) my toe was to soar and still is on Dec. 3rd.  My big toe looks like Rudolph's nose and may be able to accommodate Santa on his snowy ride around the world for Christmas. Maybe there are girls who do a good job there, but this lady needs some direction before someone looses their toe due to her lack of knowledge. I hope the Dept. of Nail Salons stops by to make sure their tools are sanitary and they have the proper licenses.<//Review>< pictures>

<text>Seriously if I could give them negative stars I would. They have the absolute worst customer service EVER! Kristal attempted to do my nails yesterday. First off she wanted me to go they her IG and pick something from there. So I looked but it’s overwhelming having to look at other peoples ideas. So I told her I’d just pick a color and I would add stuff to it. So I quickly picked this beautiful pale pink with light glitter I was going to add glitter on one nail and rhinestones in another. So she started my nails NEVER asked what shape just went off and did her thing. Never said anything of course since it was the shape I wanted. So she used a pink powder and let me add I don’t know how to do acrylic nails which is why I go to a professional to do so. When she pulled out the rhinestones I asked her if that was the color of the nail she said yes. I quickly said that’s not the color I asked for. After a frustrating couple of minutes of her trying to blame me for it she gets up and goes to I guess the manager he comes to me and asked what happened that I had showed her a picture and that was the color. NO. I told him I had chosen a color that looked nothing like this. He then tells me she could fix it. But honestly that’s the last thing I wanted to sit for another two hours while she talked on the phone and laughed and talked to the lady next to her. At the end of my frustration all they could do is tell me I SHOULD HAVE SAID SOMETHING WHEN SHE WAS DOING THE FIRST NAIL. Once again I don’t do nails, I’m not going to stop her and tell her she is doing her job wrong when I DIDNT KNOW THAT. I am never coming here again and I advise you don’t ether. At the end of the day I left with a complete different color didn’t get glitter or rhinestones but still had to pay.<//text>< UserId.>

I don't know how they get away without posting a price list for service's available. I have been going for the last 5 months and I have never paid the same price twice.  Ask for a flyer of service and prices and get told they don't have any because they are changing their prices. Apparently they make them up as they please. Time to find a new salon.</Review>

This place gets pretty busy of you don't get there early enough. The service is decent. I got gel acrylics, loved the color, and length. The shape came out better than other shops I've been to. I do dislike that you could see my nail right away after she was done. I am not sure why, but this always happens, they shape the nail too far out. The lady that was doing my pedicure did cut a little too deep on my big toe. She didn't apologize even after I made it clear that she had cut me, didn't bother cleaning with alchohol or sanitize it. I thought it was ok, but when I got home the pain was very strong, I could walk without a limp. Had to clean the cut myself and push the blood out and clean with alcohol. If they just payed a little more attention to detail, this place would be my go to.</review>

I've been coming to Nana's nails for almost 5 years.  I came in today to fix 2 nails (I broke my real nails) typically this is a $3 charge per nail. A new employee charged me $12 for 2 Nail fixes! This is insane. The manager even told her out should be $6... she insisted it was $12. So I  paid $10. No tip. And umm never coming back.  I used to love coming here because they cared.  Now it's only about money.  Seriously,  $12 for 2 nails... ridiculous.< /Text>

<text>Honestly I really tried to give this place a chance multiple times (this happens to be the nearest salon to me) but I’m pretty annoyed at this point. This was a the type of place that absolutely WONT give you a mani if you choose to get acrylics. They used the electric file thing to basically saw off your cuticles while they’re dry and only after the acrylics are on. There’s only a couple of nail techs here that actually do a great job and the rest are mediocre. Kristy did my acrylics and I had chosen her because of her pics on their IG page but I think they’re misleading. She was rushing the entire time I kept telling her to make my nails more natural looking because they were just way too thick and she got irritated at me and tried to convince me they were fine. Like lady I’m paying you $55 dollars for these acrylics (not including tip), I should be getting EXACTLY what I want. She also tried to put on nail designs even though I had already said no. I ended up going home and filing them down myself because I was so unsatisfied. Mindy did my toes though and she did a really fantastic job, the other couple of times I got my toes done here they were not as good.<//text>< Pics>

I went in to get a mani/pedi today and I am very disappointed with my experience. I’ve been going there for a few months and honestly today was not pleasant. My tech that did my toes, Ann seemed like she was rushing and kept messing up my toe nail gel and had to keep fixing because she was placing the gel heat lamp down NOT paying attention. She didn’t cut and clean cuticles on my toes. My mani tech was very pleasant but if my service is going to be rushed I may consider going else where.<//Text>

So, I decided to visit this place for a second time after hearing great things about it again. I went into the shop with a design in mind and it started with a good visit. Wrong. The guy who did my nails was so rough, bending my fingers weird ways, grunting the whole time and looked so annoyed. He later told me he was having a bad day, sorry that has nothing to do with me. He did not do the shape I wanted and he kept trying to talk me out of the design I wanted until I was annoyed and said never mind. The gel peeled of the next day, and that't not what I paid for. Gave 2 stars because the pedi was good and the color was nice but that's it, definitely not coming back.</Review>

<resp>None</resp><Review>This is a busy busy busy shop.  They take in as many people they can between 4-630pm because they close at 7pm.  You will always wait about 15-20min, some of their techs are good, some are not.  The service is kurt and RUDE.  I went in once and was sat down at Johnny's station, I showed him a picture of a design and asked if he could do something like it. The answer to my question was "CAN YOU SHOW ME HOW TO DO IT???" RUDE RUDE RUDE. They're over prices; And, on top of it all every single time I've come here for either a full set of fill I break at least 1 nail. I had a set once where I broke 3 different nails so had to come in for 3 different repairs.  I have been getting my nails done for a very long time and never have I had so many broken nails from the same shop.  I've come and gone because this place is down the street from where I live, but now I won't even go back due to convenience.  If you've been bamboozled by this place I recommend going to First Nail Shop on State College and La Palma.  Small shop, but they've been there for years, the service is incredible, the people are SO sweet and their prices are to die for.  I got a fill, cut down, repair ( from a nana's set), cuticle cut, and gel color for $34!  GOODBYE NANA'S.<//Review>< name>

When he was cutting my cuticles he was DIGGING into them, it hurt way more than it was supposed to. I'm a daughter of a nail salon owner so I've gotten my nails done plenty of times to know that it's not supposed to hurt. I got a regular mani, which was $11. Very pricey, compared to other salon places. If anything you should get your nails done on the salon that's right next to Yuva's threading. They're cheaper, nicer, and do a better job. The outcome of the nails were pretty bad, he missed a few spots in the corner of my nails, cut and shaped them irregularly, and the polish came off the very same day. They don't have a nice collection of nail polish either.. So bring in your own!</text><Resp>None<//Resp>< rate>

<Text>(Translated by Google) The truth was very expensive the first time I went, the 65dls I paid were very good because I had a good job, but the second time I went I called and asked how much just for the filling and they told me 35 when I got there wait half an hour and when I went with the one who had to do my nails, I told him about the refill and he said that no I had to do them again and he took them all out, I asked how much and he said 55 I told him it was very expensive that the first time I asked for them with design and I was charged 65 and she 55 and without design just simple, I said ok but with design and said no without design and only one color charged me 45 in the end I leave them all ugly yonlas slime well the wrong color put me hurt and I bleed my fingers the truth is a lousy service they want to charge what they want and with their bad faces still. I definitely do not recommend that place

Muy caro la verdad la primera vez que fui estuvo muy bien los 65dls que pague los di con gusto porque fue un buen trabajo, pero la segunda vez que fui llame y pregunte cuanto solo por el relleno y me dijeron 35 cuando llegue ahí espere media hora y cuando fui con la que me hiba hacer las uñas le dije del refill y me dijo que no que tenía que hacerlas nuevamente y las arrancó todas, pregunté cuánto y dijo 55 le dije que era muy caro que la primera vez las pedí con diseño y me cobraron 65 y ella 55 y sin diseño solo sencillas, le dije ok pero con diseño y dijo no sin diseño y solo de un color me cobró 45 al final las dejo todas feas yonlas limo bien el color mal puesto me lastimo y sangro mis dedos la verdad un pésimo servicios quieren cobrar lo que ellas quieran y con sus malas caras todavía. No recomiendo ese lugar definitivamente</Text>< Pics>

< Review>
It seems to be a scam, I opened an account with them and a week later I have 4 different companies asking me to activate my account so I can process payments, so far 2 of them have charged me different fees for a single transaction.  I asked the main guy I spoke with Erik Crouch (probably fake)  and he hasn't responded to my emails.  I'm assuming all these positive reviews are fake , don't go through these guys, they are expensive and possible shaddy.[Edited: the fact you're a real company makes the whole experience worse, now I have to call 4 different companies to close all services and they are still holding my funds hostage, also email you provided is ether fake or not correct]<//Review>
<pictures>None< /pictures><resp>{'time': 1628531766039, 'text': "Hi Edson, I'm so sorry to hear you had a bad experience with PaymentCloud. I promise you Erik is a real person and all the reviews you see online are from real customers. What Erik should have mentioned during your onboarding process is that PaymentCloud is not a direct credit card processor, but more of a middleman between banks, payment gateways, processors, and you. Each of these have their own fee structures, which is explicated and broken down in your merchant agreement. That's also why you received so many emails after your PaymentCloud account was set up. I'm so sorry to hear Erik hasn't gotten back to you yet to clarify this further. We are taking this up internally and would love to hear more from you. Please don't hesitate to reach out to us at support@paymentcloudinc.com so we can continue discussing your situation. I really appreciate you taking the time to leave PaymentCloud a review. Your feedback is truly appreciated and has a real effect on our internal processes so we look forward to hearing from you.

I almost never post reviews but Samantha Schwartz did such an amazing job helping our new business get payment processing when we needed it most.  She suggested solutions, communicated daily until we had the right solution nailed down and approved!  She saved our business from closing its doors over critical holiday weekend when another processor screwed us.  Bottom line Samantha is good people and will work hard to help you.  Proven results right here.  Very happy customer.< /text>

<Review>Dear Melissa Daleske,
I can’t thank you enough! This is more than a business to me it’s dear to my heart as you know because it was my boys dream before he past.
My eyes are literally tearing up because I worked so hard these past days to get this running again and truly without your tenacity, loyalty, knowledge and exceptional client services we could not have done this without you! You are truly a gem and have been since day 1.
I just wanna give you a big hug!
Thank you Mellissa for all your hard work and efforts for my sons business, I am so glad to have you as a business professional and adviser on my team.

<review>When you call, ask for Hansel Soto.  He will go to work for you and try his best to get you approved for the best rates possible.  He's very responsive and even replies back to emails after business hours.  PaymentCloud is lucky to have an employee such as Hansel.

<review>Hansel Soto was an amazing representative for me. I did not get approved for my merchant unfortunately but i will say, Hansel always responded to my emails, calls, and always kept me up to date the whole way, did not ask for a penny or any payments or anything which was incredible. I was very lucky to land on him for a rep because he went above and beyond to help me get approved. I will be using him again if i need services again! Thanks Hansel!</review><Response>{'time': 1606941376683, 'text': "Thank you so much for your kind words! We're so glad Hansel made the process easy for you.

<Text>I worked with Thomas Ryan and it was one of the best experiences I've ever had with any company hands down. Honestly, I had low expectations coming into working with payment cloud because of what I heard from other colleagues, but when I first started working with Thomas, my expectations were far exceeded. He was very professional, provided me with everything that I needed, and was very consistent with following up. Because of Thomas I will be recommending Payment Cloud to my other merchant friends. My guy definitely needs a raise.< /Text><Resp>None<//Resp><UserId.>103416807837605653420</UserId.>< Rate>

Because I do data analysis and don't sell a physical product, most merchant service providers flag me as a "High Risk" vendor and won't touch me. Neal at Payment Cloud had no trouble connecting me with an amazing service provider who took the time to understand my product. Moreover, they set it up to work through an Authorize.Net gateway, so I can accept payment through any shopping cart service provider. Neal, my account specialist, was always there for me and had excellent advice on getting my business off the ground. He never failed to return a call, never failed to return an email, and he always had an expert answer to my many questions. He's absolutely the best. I could not be more pleased that I have Payment Cloud in my corner.</Review>

This company is amazing.  They are professional and timely.  Melissa Daleske assisted me from the beginning to the end.  She answered all of my questions (even the redundant questions) and helped me setup a merchant account the proper way.  I'll definitely refer more business in the near future!  Thanks again!</Text>

Activating our merchant account was seamless. The website is easy to navigate and effortless to get to what you want and need. PaymentCloud was responsive to all my inquiries, and assisted me all the way through the entire process from application to activation to ensuring my account was ready for processing payments. Great job...and keep up the great work!</review>

She resolved a issue that PayKings has been "trying" to help me with for weeks, in a matter of a couple hours. I can say without a doubt that Alissa is my favorite new person I have in contact with in a while. Thanks Guys< /review>< time>

<text>I can't say enough good things about Payment Cloud. My rep Ashleigh Girton was amazing & provided us with such a professional & quality experience. I recently launched a new company & had an urgent need for a payment system & Ashleigh jumped right in with insightful & diverse solutions to our problem. She went ABOVE & BEYOND to make sure my experience was a great one. I would highly recommend  Payment Cloud to anyone looking for great customer service & innovative solutions.< /text>< Pictures>

Although my rep was responsive, David made a huge mistake.  I was assured that the 6 months reserve the processor was taking would roll back into my business account after 6 months.The processor  explained that this was a trick to get me to sign up. Instead of 6 MONTHS OF RESERVE rolling into my account as promised in February of this year when I signed up, I can only expect 10% of the sales from 1 month of the 6 months to roll into my account and this can only be requested twice a year. On August 14, 2020 I texted David to ask him when I could expect the 6 months reserve withheld to hit my account. He told me to call the processor. During this conversation I explained how helpful the reserve was, like an involuntary savings account for my business. We discussed this in length then but today he pretended that we never had that conversation. 6 months ago, pre pandemic this mistake would not have been so grave. Typically, my industry has a slow season. The reserve was supposed to get us through. I'm devastated. I would never choose Payment cloud again. They are so heavy on sales that they say anything to get you on board. Pray for my team.</Review>

After dealing with so much hassle with othr merchant services, when I came  across Payment Cloud I was very nervous. I heard they were rated high on which merchant services to go through. I had been denied already with no explanation. I just took over a well established business and was losing money. I went ahead and contacted them, and within minutes was contacted by Faith Travis. Faith went above and beyond customer servise. She not only explained all issues and helped me apply without wasting my time. She was there every step of the way and answered every question onestly and explained the do, the donts. The fees are incerdible. They are the lowest I have ever heard of with a creit card merchant. Then on top of the low fees, we received  free POS equipment. I highly recommend contacting Payment Cloud now.. Thanks Again!!!</Text>

Jack at payment cloud is the essence of what a good company should strive for. Dedicated, Determined, and Placing the needs of the customer before his own. Payment Cloud should hire 1000 Jack Berries. But since there is only one, I will state I am more than satisfied with the outcome of how payment cloud has helped my business grow with merchant processing. I definitely strongly recommend this company.< /text>

Recommend this company 100% especially Faviola if you can request to work with her! She knew what she was doing and had my account set up within 2 days! Huge relief after I had dealt with a different company and no account for 3 weeks! Amazing customer support, communication, and the paperwork was a breeze. Very happy client here.</Text>

Melissa D. at PaymentCloud is AMAZING to work with. Sharp, on top of her game, incredibly knowledgeable, and answered all my questions quickly and professionally. We're considered a 'high risk' category of processing, but she made the entire process seamlessly smooth and with in a rapid turnaround. Highly Recommend!< /text>

<text>I was a bit apprehensive re undertaking the switchover to a new CC processor. The person who helped me, Melissa, was great, always helpful and good-natured. I'm actually quite pleased with Ecwid, the store I chose  to replace SquareSpace's Stripe (who doesn't allow CBD-related sales). Authorize.net was responsible in setting up my account. PaymentCloud took a problematic conversion - and made it rather simple.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><Review>I’m not sure about their service, but I personally wouldn’t recommend them as a place to work. If their hiring process was awful I’d expect their employees to be just as unprofessional as their CEO. Their CEO was constantly on their phone during the interview texting others about me, my background, as well as the institution I attended for college. Clearly, their phone and talking to his friends was more important than conducting the interview for the sales position they were hiring. You would think that the CEO would do research before on that type of information before doing an interview with the potential employee. The CEO even stated he’d send me an offer and be prepared for it since I had done well in the interview, despite that happening. Go figure, I wasn’t extended an offer not ever followed back up with concerning the offer I was supposed to receive despite the CEO verbalizing to both me and the hiring manager to send me one and that I should expect one within a few days. I mean, I wouldn’t have accepted it anyway, it was just incredibly unprofessional on all accounts.< /Review>< Rate>

<Text>I can’t say enough about this company! I sell “high risk” items and went crazy trying to locate a company that understood my needs and wasn’t out to take advantage of me. I worked with David M. And he walked me through all the steps needed to get my merchant and gateway account going. Finally a company that works with the real world and not with politics. Thank you payment could and David! I’d give you 10 stars if I could!</Text>< pictures>

If you are looking for a high risk merchant account there's really no need to look anywhere else. They are the most knowledgeable and honest credit card processors I have ever worked with. I worked with Neal on a couple of accounts and was extremely pleased to say the least.<//Review>

{'time': 1563301671647, 'text': "Jeremiah, I'm sorry you had a bad experience with PaymentCloud. We spoke with our sales rep who has documented the correspondence with you. The site inspection was hired by the bank as an added measure to mitigate risk. In our industry we see a great deal of fraud as you can imagine, often times people will obtain stolen SSN information and try to open up a merchant account in someone else's name. For your protection and the bank's they conduct site inspections contracted by a third party. I assure you all your information is safe and being treated according to proper security practices. It appears that there were some outstanding underwriting stipulations that were not met on your end which caused a delay in the approval. This should have been conveyed to you with more clarity and for that we will take full responsibility. If you wish, I can assign a different rep to see the case through as I believe your account can still be approved as long as the outstanding items are received. Your experience is important to us and we truly value your business. Please reach out to us with any concerns."}<//resp>

These people are a scam. I talk to a sales representative by the name of Brandon who seems nice at first but really is a money hungry sales agent who will discard your file for the slightest reason without telling you. Brandon sent someone to our house to inspect our home business for a merchant account and take our private information only to never be heard of again. Where is our information?? What did they do with it? I am afraid now because they have my fiancé’s and I social security number and business information. I plan on closely monitoring my credit report at this point. I suggest you avoid working with them. Even though there local I would still avoid it it. Contact me for more information.</review>

<Text>I have to give a tremendous review to Payment Cloud, and esp the Senior Acct Mgr helping me now, Melissa Daleske.  Melissa has worked tirelessly on my behalf, going beyond what I ever expected, to get  me the  best results I could have hoped for.

I had previous great service from Payment Cloud so I reccomend their services.

Paymentcloud has gone above and beyond for me and my business. Taking time to really explain everything in easy to unserstand language and having wonderous patience with me as im new to alot of this stuff. Not only all of that but from the time i applied to the time i was approved and set up ready to go was only around 3 days. Quick responses awesome customer service. They got back to me within hours when other companies take days or even weeks. Cant recommend enough!<//Review>

<text>Great merchant processing company! My business is in the high risk category, I had to provide a few extra details about my business as well as make some adjustments to my website, however I had a great account representative that walked me through the entire process and got me approved for a merchant account. The vaolume limit on my account is slightly lower than I asked for however that's to be expected for any start up business in the high risk category. I am very happy with the, comparably, excellent processing rates, and the really nice virtual terminal they set me up with.
Highly recommend company!
Thank you

<Review>Great company. Tried to get a processor, after my last one was unfairly taken away, and the experience has been a nightmare for my business. For the last 6 months you really get a sense of who really cares about businesses, and who is just trying to get their commission. I can honestly say Neil and Jaime at Payment Cloud are actually HUMAN! Lol, sounds like a joke, but ALL of the other companies gave up on me after a first try. Neil and Jaime kept on trying and kept updating me, even when I was too busy to update them. They kept at it and got me a great processor. They even helped me to set it up so that I was better protected. Definitely felt like they were on my team and I would highly recommend them if anyone has lost their CC processor and are in need of a new one!< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

Faviola, Faviola, Faviola! We have a vaping business and were facing issues in getting an online processor. First we were introduced to another company (which I won't name) and they had the worst customer service and would take days to respond to us. In addition, we were trying to change our domain name which made this process even more complicated. That was until we met Faviola who walked us through the whole process, always returned our emails quickly, and stayed patient with us from start to finish. Make sure to get in contact with her as she is truly the best at what she does. Couldn't thank you enough Faviola!!< /Text>

<review>Great Experience all around! I had been shut down by multiple merchant providers and was considering giving up. I was referred over to PaymentCloud and worked with Russell. He gave me some great insight into how merchant accounts worked, and took a very direct approach to get the account set up for me and kept me informed along the whole process. Plus, not only did he get me one account, but he set me up for eCheck processing and chargeback mitigation services as well. I would recommend this company to anyone that has had any difficulty in this space. Thanks!<//review>< date>

<Text>I'm so glad to have worked with Payment Cloud! I worked with Faviola Paz specifically and she was amazing. We ran into some road blocks, but she continued to work hard to get my business approved for a merchant account. The attention and support I received was even more impressive considering our company is a small early stage startup.  We are now accepting credit cards all thanks to Payment Cloud! I could not be happier with their level of service and would highly recommend them to anyone.<//Text>< Pics>

<Text>Horrible experience. Payment Cloud gave my information to a third party vendor who tried to sell me additional services and used false bait and switch emails that made it seem like the email came from Paymentcloud.

Emails were returned promptly before we signed up but after we signed up  it took days to get a response.

We got up and running after I was forced to call into the  Payment Cloud customer service line. I was unable to get set up due to multiple wrong email links being sent and multiple  wrong ID numbers being sent.
This made the process annoying and frustrating.

Once we got up and running we processed a few transactions from our long time clients (1+ years) where their cards had been operating on a monthly recurring charge. It just so happened that a couple of these clients got new CC and had not notified us.

This triggered our account to get put on hold.
I was not notified of this and had to call into customer service multiple times to figure out what was going on.

I reached out to Chelsie and got no responses, I called into customer service and was provided  0 answers.
Because I had no idea what was going on, I called the customer service number for the bank listed in my email.

That customer service rep let me know my account was put on hold because of a couple of failed transactions. I was never notified by the bank or by PaymentTech.
Upon conversation with the bank customer service, I asked them when our funds would be withdrawn. The rep told me 120 days.
I was unable to get an explanation and asked what would be the fastest way to get it? I asked if it would be faster to have our clients chargeback the payments and transact on another platform.
This angered the rep and without getting an answer the call was ended.
After hearing about an escalated insistent on my account when I sent an URGENT! email, Paymentcloud finally called me to say, you shouldn't talk directly to the bank.  Payment cloud said they would take over and provide updates.
(this would have been helpful if they had returned my calls and emails)

The only updates I received were along the lines of I will check on it.
It has been weeks and I still have no update in regards to our funds.

Throughout this whole process, communicating with PaymentTech has been a NIGHTMARE.
You should expect to send 2-3 follow up emails to get an answer that says I will look into it and never hear back.
After posting this review, I received an email stating they had called several times as well as emailed. (not true)
I finally got 1 call after this review was written yet still no update to my account.

I would NEVER recommend them</Text>< pics>

{'time': 1533944188215, 'text': 'On July 12th 2018 This high risk merchant was approved with us in 24 hours with a high volume account and without a need for a reserve upfront. They started processing with us and on their first few batches the merchant received over 53% declined cards and fraud pick up cards. The bank asked for additional information from the merchant and when the merchant spoke to the bank he stated that he would ask all his clients to charge back their transactions. We attempted to help keep the account in active status with the bank by requesting a "good faith" exception but because the merchant stated they would request cardholders to file chargebacks coupled with the declined cards and fraudulent cards, the bank decided to exit the relationship. The batch of transactions in the amount of $4,685.00 was held by the bank this is usually reviewed and released in 120 days even after all this, we asked for an exception to have the review and release happen in 30 days. We have gone above and beyond to help this merchant and have continued to update him with status, we have called multiple times and often times his mailbox is full so we have been emailing him every few days. We would like to help you resolve this issue asap and have been working hard for a solution for your business. We have assigned our SE Regional President, Chelsie Cooper to your account and she can be reached at the number and e-mail that was sent to you on Aug, 10 2018, we hope to hear from you soon!'}</Resp>

<text>I was paired with the sales representative Javier who was supposed to help me with a high-risk merchant account. Dealing with Javier was one of the most difficult, unclear, and unprofessional sales processes I have even been through. Javier would rarely provide me with detailed answers to my questions. I had to repeat questions via email numerous times and ask for detailed explanations before I would get a half effort response that barely answered my questions. His attitude was passive aggressive and it was incredibly difficult to get truthful responses from him in regards to pricing, contract terms, and general insight about my account. Javier made various mistakes and mislead me multiple occasion throughout the 40+ emails that were sent back and forth.

I was sent emails for various services unrelated to my account and was signed up to services without knowing. When I asked Javier about them I was told they were sent in error and to ignore them.

During the setup stage I was informed on various different companies involved in my account which I wasn't made aware of previously.

After my application was accepted the support team failed to set up my processing account correctly. Multiple days of account errors later my account was terminated for being an unqualified business with no further explanation. Support is difficult to get a hold of and I have been waiting multiple days just to find out why my account that was previously accepted was now considered unqualified.

I have been told to reach out to the companies Payment Cloud signed me up with to cancel my accounts they set up on my own.

I have dealt with most of the large payment processors and merchants on the market for various business models, PaymentCloud was by far the worst experience out of them all.< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

We always get our dog food from here. They are super friendly and helpful. I just had our baby and my husband has returned back to work so I had to bring the baby and they helped carry the dog food to the car with out me even asking. I highly recommend this place.</Review>

Hemme Hay & Feed has anything you need for any animal you have. And if they don't have it they can order it. I love going to Hemme Hay. I find what I need and something I didn't know I needed.  It's always a win win for me.< /text>

Hemme is great. They answer your questions, have a variety of products displayed, and organize supplies so you can find it. If you don’t see it - ask. They carry a large variety of local hay. The prices are fair.</text>

Used to have them delivered all the time. Now I pretty much stopped going or ordering from them, just because the delivery fees have jumped from $20 to $25, then to $35 for less than 11 months. And as for dog food, I can get the same from Wal-Mart for $15 and they want $30. I found another feed that can make delivery for only $25 fee and they don't jump prices.

After 6 years with them, we now no longer trust it and non of you shouldn't go there anymore unless the can validates reduced the prices.</Review>

<Review>Only go to shop at Hemme Hay & Feed when really need something and we're in the area to stop in and see how expencive their items are. They are the best of the best products there. At least Hemme Hay & Feed thinks that's the way it is. For me not so much on my part. They're out of the way well any feed store is for us and where we live about 20 miles away.<//Review>< Pictures>

Hemme has great products for pets and farm animals at very reasonable prices. Service is always great and personable. The owner Robert, is there most of the time to help with any questions and will not try to sell you what's most expensive, but what your pets or animals really need. Personnel are friendly and will load your car or truck when you're ready to go!<//text>

This place is awesome and the people here are of a specially high quality kind of awesome. There so nice and the owner John is so kind. This is without a doubt the best animal lover shop in Av. And there products cater too people with a low budget to high priced merch without giving losing quality for either shopper. You will never shop anywhere else for animals ever again if you come here just once.</review>

Lanny son of owner randomly verbally threatening customers horrible experience! I was a customer today I am no longer!

this employee who feels because he claims he is the owners son that he can mistreat and threaten customers. He assists in loading products and randomly began verbally threatening customers with And trying to fight them.
No customer who has already paid for their products should have to feel unsafe at a Feed store. This has been a terrible experience and highly unprofessional. I will not ever return to this feed store and you shouldn't either. He continuously attempted to verbally threaten, come close to customers and said they would hurt them. As a business owner my self I am beyond disappointed to have experienced this type of treatment. I would highly recommend the owner reaching out to discuss this matter because it could Not be solved with the manager.<//text>

I've never had an issue here and am always happy with the products and service provided. However, they are still a handwritten-receipt vendor. An upgrade to digital inventory and checkout would help them greatly.<//review>

I went to visit Hemme just to see if I could find pine cone pellets and they helped me right away. They showed me samples and figured out the right kind of pellets. Afterwards, I just had to walk over to the warehouse part and i was assissted all the way to my car. Great service and reasonable prices! 👍👍👍</text>

The people who work here are super nice and helpful.  The store and feed shop have a lot of choices.  The prices range from surprisingly good to average or a little high depending on what you want to purchase.  They have some used saddles in the back for sale and the prices are pretty good.</text>

They are a very helpful and knowledgeable place to get everything you could need for home and ranch (large or small) and even your garden. The staff is a pleasure to talk with and actually remembers you even if you haven't been there for several months. They have a lot of items you will not find anywhere and some that you may not know you need to make your task easier.<//text>

This place is nice. They staff is always there to help find what you need. Has some custom made bridals and breast collars. Inventory can be over priced, but options are limited in the Valley.</Review>

Always friendly and knowledgable. If they don't have what you need they will either order it for you or tell you where you can get it. Very affordable, fair, and reasonable pricing. Very helpful and handy when loading your products for you. Great business and great employees.</review>

I like everybody there and I like all they offer. However , i bought a rabbit hutch for $155.99. A wonderful older gentleman offered to drop it off at my house because we both live in the Antelope Acres. That was all fantastic. But when we moved it into the garage, it started falling apart. We needed it right away though, so we caulked some and nailed some things and its a little more sturdy.
Full disclosure: I havent called them yet, so they may do something to rectify the problem. 😃😁</Review>

<text>Went here before a holiday party with a very specific idea of what I wanted to get done! I also had to get some harder Japanese gel removed and they followed all instructions to remove it super well! I loved the outcome and the girls were all so nice! Great find!< /text>< name>

I was handed a menu of pedicure options and I chose a $45 option because I needed callous removal which was treated as extra here (this was the cheapest option for it) and when I got to the front to pay, I was told that the gel was $15 more on top of that. The pedicure was average, the massage in the $45 package was like 3 minutes, and I think that unless there is real gold in the polish, no average pedicure is worth $65. I felt cheated and I will not return, neither will my friends who I went there with.<//text>

My nails the day after the manicure at this salon. Not sure if I need to explain even further? I would have done a x10000 job myself.
Also, they reeeeeally want to up sell you on all possible services they can to the point it becomes very annoying.</review>

I had a wonderful experience. I got the classic mani pedi and it was fabulous. The interior is beautiful and very clean and the staff are professional and very kind and talented. I truly enjoyed my experience and will be coming back!</Review>

<name>Becky Foster<//name><Date>1561495683668< /Date><rating>1<//rating><Text>I have just had the worst nail experience of my life. They were obviously overbooked and were rushing everyone. I showed her a design and she said that they don’t have that glitter so I picked a different glitter, she just seemed like she did not want to do it. Then she proceeded to do the worst job at cutting my cuticles, I looked almost better when I came in. And then when it came for the glitter application she did it way  I have just had the worst experience of my life. She then started to apply my glitter before she had applied the French ombre tip . I had to remind her that the glitter comes after the white polish, which was so obvious… So she had to remove and redo. Then as it was coming towards the end I mentioned that I feel like my cuticles were not cut properly, I waited until now to give her enough time just in case she would do it at the end or something… She then told me that it was  because of the filing process that my nail cuticles looked like that. And then proceeded to finish with oil. As I left I was looking at my nails and realize that a portion of one of the nails was already coming off as she had painted over my skin and that portion was peeling. I cannot believe I had to pay $40 for the service. Not to mention she got up about 8 times to answer the phone, serve other clients etc .<//Text>< pics>

<text>GO SOMEWHERE  ELSE. New in town, and was hoping to have a relaxing nail session. Unfortunately, the woman that was doing my nails ( short hair, older woman) was VERY rude and unfriendly. Kept rushing me to pick a color even though there were no other customers waiting. She asked me 4 times, and called me slow.When I showed her what color I was looking for, her response, “ we have lots of colors, I DON’T KNOW”. I really don’t appreciate this service what so ever. Very uncomfortable session as well as embarrassing how you spoke to me. As for the quality of my gel nails, also not great. Sides of nail missing color.</text>< rating>

<review>I come to this salon randomly cause is far away for me but is a great place. The prices are competitive and the work is always excellent. Lucy did my last mani last time and she was ultra careful with my cuticles and applying the gel color overall. Will come more often.

<Name>Sunniva Finney< /Name><Time>1544578536009</Time><Rating>2</Rating><Text>The owner is friendly, and I have had a good experience before. Recently, I had an awkward experience. I feel the salon nickel and dimes for a fill. The fill itself costs forty, which is reasonable. My nails were already short and I asked for the tips to be filed a bit. Keep in mind the technician already has to file and shape nails while doing a fill; she charged me five dollars for a change in nail shape! The gel polish was on my cuticle, and my finger after manicure as well. I am not trying to be cheap here, but I don’t think it was necessary for her to charge me extra for a shape change. I will not return to this location. I can get a better manicure elsewhere for ten dollars less, and I won’t feel like I am being haggled for the price of my fill.</Text>< pics>

<review>This is the best nail salon! First of all it is beautiful and clean. Everything is sterilized and each file is used only once. Liners are used for the foot baths. Everyone is always nice and friendly. The owners are awesome and if you ever have a problem, with anything, you can talk to them and they do their best to fix it. I do call to make an appointment but usually on the same day of the appointment and they always accommodate me. I just love this place.</review><user_id>108507630855637072897< /user_id>< response>

Admittedly I don't get my nails done much and this time it was no different. I went here because I ran out of options on how to fix a freaking vertically split nail. I super glued it twice and it just kept catching and getting worse. On top of that another nail chipped on the other hand. That was when I sought professional help and OMG had an opening that Saturday morning.

Li is my lady in shining armor because she showed me the magic of nail tips. As the usual Silicon valley tech worker coming in with some severely short nails with no polish and a hang nail or two, I came out of there like an Instagram hand model! She is my champion and yeah I'm going to get them again but this time a bit shorter.< /Text>

This last time I came in I was disappointed since two of my nails had already chipped and broken and I had gotten them done there less than 2 weeks prior. The nail lady charged me an extra $10 for changing my nail shape and fixing the broken nails. On top of that, a lady who sat next to me (who was a regular) didn't get charged for her nail shape change, I've never gone to a place around here that selectively charges extra for that service.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< GmapID>

Bubbles appeared on a few of the nails within hours of getting it done and left streaks in the finish. Less than a week later, a few of the nails already have paint peeling back. For $40 (including tip) I'm not at all impressed. Won't be back unless they want to cover service for a new manicure.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Very friendly manicurists who have remembered me every time.  LOTS of gel polish colors/brands to choose from - to the point where deciding can be a little overwhelming! They do a great job on pedicures & (gel) manicures, and both have always lasted me awhile.< /Text>

Melody Park is a very fun place to hang out at. There’s plenty of space for you to play around. Although, it would’ve been five stars if they opened their restrooms on Sundays. My friends and I thought about walking to Shells (gas station was a 3-4 minute walk) and using their restroom.</review>

Google: So what does that tell you about your neighborhood and your current living situation?
Me: Well played Google. Well played.
But at least they have a local church who runs the rec room brings some positive vibes and tries to keep it clean. We'll give em that...</text><user_id>113121288279931126180</user_id><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<Text>Awesome experience from start to purchas. Olin was great answered all my questions which was a lot and he provided additional details same or next day.
Purchase and pickup was quick outside with masks as requested during this COVID pandemic was much appreciated.
I highly recommend Crevier and thanks again Olin!<//Text>< Pics>

<text>Awesome collection! Wish I had 50grand to spend on a car! Wonderfully allowed us to wander and drool. Some cars are stored for private owners, but a large selection of classic cars for sale.</text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOZC4cq7iMsHRSO_bjqKKpQZAyeMckd53ryk3qI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOoYFbwGe1TSs53-Fw_KAgXAfgB9q7XJimoRHR9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNbcLHEvO1qyWysuBrPif1MHWYRAFdFVzfmRtZR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOK8tvP4eG5AHbuszQCUjpSiOkeAZiLN6uDHipV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMEsD_ePAWlbZSSq6t6gOLp7WVgFMKHpGfvZfqY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP5dZ56Vvxwt89fjFXfwyhVIGH4u1fdv0OJyraM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO8uCuSgRuG_rMIc548dlGOVyhUdif-hqzudvTO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPzRnX487gt9fnHrMXG99aGNIBRw1sB7M3qa0Ws=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOJlViWcN9EGqxnVNZ77FKuL3LSvjIIS3ghasNg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80dcdf002c150cb3:0xb2e793b17c71601f</gmap_id></record>

They may call this a "used" car showroom but it is far more than that.  The exterior is plainly industrial so the facade understates the great content that lies within. I am telling you to hold your breath when you enter this building if you love fantastic automobiles because it will take your breath away over and over...

My experience, I walked into the showroom last week and was literally stunned by what I found. The front area (three lavish rooms), it is like a country club lounge and an auto museum combined... Pool table, large screen television, lounge tables, sofas, and more are all available to the public. This is a very special sleek environment that has that classy feel one would naturally associate with the top level product that Crevier is known to offer.

Walking through the lounge into the spacious showroom that is large enough to be an airline hanger I gaze long afield to see rows and rows of amazing cars. Classics that are in practically perfect condition.. all of them!

I had met a member who pointed me towards his pride, a 2013 Boss 302 (500hp) SchoolBus Yellow Mustang.. For sure one of the newer offerings but wow, it is gorgeous!

I asked a visiting group which car was the favorite. One in the party immediately pointed to a1936 Cord that is spectacular. He told me that he preferred a 1937 model but this beauty would stand in it's absence, no hesitation on his part.

Meanwhile, I hear the gutteral sounds of a carefully driven Grey Ferrari that was being looked at.. I then talked with the man they have cleaning and waxing all these gorgeous cars (I found out his favorite wax and also why he chooses that particular product). I asked a group that is from Port Hueneme, California which car they would pick if they could have any... The gal in this threesome told me, "The Pink Hollywood Jeep"... She pointed it out towards the back of the showroom (see my photos.. she said it was in a movie).

Some members have their classic car in the Crevier Showroom because they enjoy sharing it with others; people that come through the showroom are delighted by the collection.

Many of these gorgeous historical classic cars are for sale so this is a great place to find that polished and pampered classic that you have been searching for (they have a list if you are interested).

A great place to visit when you are in Costa Mesa. You will love Crevier Classic Cars!

My wife and I stopped here as it was close to our hotel. There is a nice variety of vehicles here. I can't say that I've seen an 8C, an F40, and a Dusenberg all in the same place! The staff fully understands that some people are just there to browse, which was appreciated. They were even happy to talk about the cars that were there. A good place to stop in, I recommend it. As a bonus, it's located at the end of John Wayne's runway, so you can do some plane watching if you are into it!<//review>

FANTASTIC! Last Friday we had a very good look around this huge warehouse which contains an incredible collection of very high end classic cars. Most of the beautiful cars belong to Donnie Crevier who obviously loves unique cars. And most of the vehicles are in concourse condition too. I had a chat with the head mechanic Jose and also with Mike Kuriel the general manager who both filled me on some great stories about the cars...and the owners. Best of all it is free to have a look around.We loved it!</Text>

Thank you very much, Frank, who helping me to get my first classic car in my life, so beautiful - 1941 Cadillac Red. You are my best Frank!
It's an honor when we met Mr. Donnie Crevier, he told me about his wish to visit my home country, it's wonderful.
Very Welcome Mr. Donnie and Mr. Frank and everyone whos love to come VietNam. To be best served for the trip please call me.

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>Smart and Final was just as its name. I  went for a specific item that  at least 3 other supermarkets ran out of and "Wallah there was Light"... The store was clean, organized the cashiers and manager was amazing. To top it off, not crowded. The manager even went out of his was to go check for a specific item for me. This took place in the early evening. For those of you who dont know; Smart and Final is the Business!! 👍🏼👍🏼< /Text>< pictures>

<Review>Nice clean store. Has everything you need and more.  The staff was nice and helpful when asked for them to look for things. Check out was a breeze too. Like that the food they sold was fresh and they have a large selection of vegetables too. Overall 5 stars.</Review>< pictures>

Generally I love the things in this store. But when I purchased ears of corn Each one had dry spots. I don't feel it was a good quality of corn. I wouldn't purchase that from whoever you got it from again.</review>

The employees at Smart & Final are helpful, and the store is always clean.  While they don't go deep into all brands, I generally find what I need either with a national brand or their store brand.

This trade-off results typically at lower prices compared to grocery chains that stock every size and brand variation.</review>

<Text>I really appreciate that they carry the bigger bulk bag of pistachios that other local stores do not. My only complaint is that their green lettuces are a hit or miss, sometimes they're yellowing/brownish or really crispy green fresh.<//Text><Gmap_id>0x80c33114de2c2d5f:0xc0e50cdb3a3449a2</Gmap_id>< user_id>

This store is very clean. Convenient. Affordable. Nice quality meats. Vegetables are usually always fresh. Like every other business at certain peek hour's when they're really busy but they usually open up other registers. The staff the are just as nice as ever. They make it very welcoming. They remember their regular customers & I appreciate them for that. Parking has changed a little due to the gym next door so evenings might be less parking available.<//text>

<review>I liked this store, very spacious and clean ! Great selection of coffee, fruit and pastries. Plus when I was able to relax the fruit I bought there was Absolutely delicious and better than candy. The only drawback about this store is it's in Upland and I live in San Bernardino and I only have my motorcycle so I really don't have Enough room on it to buy what and how much I want to. Other than that this place Rock's ☆</review>< Pictures>

Nice selection of fresh produce. Baking essentials such as flour and sugar are available in both individual and bulk sizes. Great selection of food containers. Their store brand is good for most things, but the scrubber sponges they offer are not the best quality.<//Text>

<text>Have shopped at Smart & Final for a long time. Clean stores, most have a good selection of product, produce is fresh, well maintained and generally of very good quality. Same with the meats and frozen goods. However their home brand goods and name brand goods I feel are on the high side. Now their sale goods sometimes are quite a good deal, for instance today I purchased California raised and butchered chicken half breasts, bone in for $0.88 a pound. Now I won't mention the farm that it came from but they are always fresh, always in CA. That's just about half price! Whenever I see a good price for something I like and use it's usually at S&F. But tonight I broke my Cardinal rule for grocery shopping, don't shop hungry, lol!</text><Rating>4<//Rating><username>Gennipher G. Geepers</username></record>

I've been shopping at S & F since shortly after they opened.  I've always been made to feel welcomed to be a customer.  It is a little out of the way for me since I'm closer to Colonies. I never shopped at the previous store at that location.  I was pleased with the service I  received when I ordered large pots of flowers for a backyard wedding we hosted.  Thanks to Lanae.<//text>

I love this store. ♥  It's clean and well stocked.  I love the "rainstorm" that happens in the produce section when the produce is about to be washed.  All of the checkers and other employees are always helpful and friendly.  The prices are great and last, but not least, the music played over the intercom is perfect.  I love being in this store.</text>

A very competitive priced organic section, nice variety of organic triple washed ready to eat salad greens I enjoy finding specials on quality items like Vitamin Water and Bai drinks early morning I can find nice looking meats and fish (not all) with sell by date for that day 50% off just freeze or cook that same day everyone should shop Smart & Final you'll be back for sure<//Text>

Julie was our cashier and she said not one word to us the whole time we was in front of her. Not even our total to pay. Doesn't help bag and crushed your item to make room  this isn't the first time I had this experience with julie. She needs some customer service training again. My daughter is a former employee of smart and final in diamond bar. Never got that treatment.  All your other employees are super awesome.  I am disappointed to say the least< /review>

I always find the store clean and we'll organized. The prices are generally lower on most popular items and the meat dept is always having exceptual prices and lower everyday prices and it's high quality meats are surprisingly inexpensive. The produce products are also high quality and lower prices than most competitors.< /Review>

Good service, easy shopping. Aisles are wide and they don't crowd them with sale products like Stater Brothers across the street. Friendly and helpful staff, they know where to direct you to product in the store. Reasonable prices. I will make this my store to shop.<//review>

Good prices, many specials, and the roasted chickens make Smart & Final the place to shop.
Bring your own bags to save even more.< /Text>

Had a terrible experience with a cashier who was unbelievably rude to me. Accused me of stealing and profiled me, all because i came in twice in one day and blatantly warned the other cashier about me as i was walking away. I had the receipts for both transactions and spoke with a manager who was kind and apologetic. However i will be taking this to corporate. This kind of treatment needs to stop. I will be taking my business elsewhere, so disappointed.< /Text>

< Review>
One of the very best and most enjoyable dining experiences in San Francisco is Leopold's.  From the moment you walk in, you will be transported to Vienna or Salzburg.  The wonderful Austrian music, the laughing, the cheers and the smells of amazing Austrian food will fill the air.   The food here is incredible.  Be sure to get the meat salumi platter, which is one of the very best things in San Francisco!   Enjoy the Stiegl and the schnapps and be sure to say hello to Hans, who is always working the restaurant.</Review>

We are from Austria and visited San Francisco and to our surprise we found Leopold's Austrian Restaurant. The wine, the beer, the appetizer and entrees were impressive, that's how delicious everything was. From the second we walked in we were treated wonderful, everyone was so friendly. We went back a second time because it was THAT GREAT.< /text>

The wait staff are friendly and helpful and genuinely interested in you having a great time. The first page of the menu lists all of their authentic dishes, and the other three pages are all the beer and wine selections. Yum!

<Text>Everything tastes amazing and also the atmosphere is very welcoming and homey. You will feel like you are in Europe all of a sudden! :) My favourite dish is the Goulash. The meat is so tender and goes perfectly well with a glass of red wine (or with their huge selection of beer!) One of the best German place in the city for sure.</Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMsxapTUteCppvwMxz2XoXtmq6vU-TGuXFTJPHT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNMlMiK8j4HHT8OH7_b340ddBkAa0gRPKc32Wi3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPn7iLJTlRHPCggkFyCt4Wg5gPoT_3UbztikLKL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x808580e868c4e2bb:0x19cb77125f42a5e9</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Great food! The schnitzel with sauce is so delicious and so heavy I recommend to approach it as a dish for two. You have to try the Lintz dessert, it's a dream!< /Review>

The atmosphere and decor encourages you to channel your inner Austrian. Service is friendly, food is good and portions are generous. The restaurant can accommodate large groups and when there is a large group in, be prepared for some noise!< /Review>

Always trying to find good Austrian or German food, this place did not disappoint!  From the great beer options to the perfectly prepared wienerschnitzel and linzer torte, this brought back memories from my youth.  It's difficult to find such good establishments as most rely on word of mouth for advertisement, but I am glad I walked by it earlier that day.  It was a great meal to end the day!< /Review>

Mussels many different ways. This franchise which serves Belgian mussels was so much fun with my friends who enjoyed it so much they went to another Leopold's later that week. The Crustaceans were delicious and fresh and well prepared at each one of us enjoyed our sauces salads m8i6</review>

Excellent food, it reminded me of my grandmothers Central European cooking. The atmosphere made me feel like I was in the middle of Oktoberfest and was just a comfortable, inviting atmosphere. The staff was friendly, the food came in time, and was delicious. I would recommend the jaegerschnitzel.</Text>

Such a great friendly and welcoming neighborhood vibe from the moment you are greeted at the entrance. Fantastic beer selection,   and excellent food every time. Make it a point to stop in at least every other month. Highly recommend! Pro tip: shortbread dessert</Text>

I thought I didn't German/Austrian food till I came here. The red cabbage is crave worthy.  The pork tenderloin was tender and flavorful, the short ribs were perfect, and the trout was very good.  ( And no, I didn't eat 3 entrees!  There were 3 of us and we kept trading our food because it was all so good.)

The atmosphere is good. Loud with human laughter and talking. The booths are a little uncomfortable, and the bar has no knee room so you have to sit sideways.  But it's so festive and delicious, those details are inconsequential.

I'll choose Leopold's any time I come to San Francisco.</text>

Great place, had a greatly great atmosphere here, just like in Austria or Germany. They had delicious Weihenstephaner and Apfelstrudel blue sausages and tasty ribs. I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because to me the beer was a little too expensive and the strudel was very small :(<//text>

<review>This is a great spot just a 15-20 min walk  away from the touristy 'Wharf' area. The menu is pretty much all Austrian with a fanatastic beer selection. We were there on a Saturday night with another couple. The place was hopping but the service was top notch. The women ordered appetizers and the men ordered mains. The portion sizes were perfect. All food was very tasty and we all had a great time. Highly recommended.<//review>< pictures>

<Review>It's a block away and i finally went after too many missed years....This place is great. Great host.  Amazing vibe. Fantastic menu. Bring a small squad and be loud. Drink and be merry. Everyone loved their meal, but for me the short ribs with mashed potatoes is one or the best things I've ever eaten. Eat here and smile.<//Review>< response>

Great staff and owner. Lots of beer options and sizes go into 5L boot. I can't comment in the food as mostly everything had one thing or other that I couldn't eat. I will say that it gets really really busy during dinner rush. We went in and got few beers and waited about 2hr or so without any luck. For that I would advise making a reservation in advance. I would also say that the owner or manager was really great, kept checking on everyone (including us) to make sure they're taken care of, and not in a creepy way but more of a caring way. I felt as if I was in a restaurant  that's in small town and pretty much everyone knows everyone else. I would definitely go there again with an advance reservation.</review>

Some things are  better than others.  Jaegershnitzel over short ribs, for example.  Beer over wine. The salad and the $8soft pretzel were the best tasting things of the night! Good apple struedel, too. Good service.<//Text>

<text>Love the atmosphere. The owner open the door and greeted us in and out of the restaurant. It's like an Oktoberfest family friendly, dog friendly, but overall cheers and people friendly feel. Come have dinner, try the stroodle, have a pretzel and a beer. They have wine too, and a full bar.<//text><name>Adriant Sanchez<//name><Time>1562341672468<//Time><Rate>5<//Rate><response>None</response>< pictures>

<Review>This is the only place I've been able to find that offers beers in such a huge range of sizes. You can literally get 0.3 L, 0.5L, 1L, 2L, 3L or 5L steins - no joke. Fun Bavarian atmosphere, and the owner, Klaus is often there giving a hearty greeting to diners. Folks here seem to come to have a good time, and there's plenty of table-to-table interaction. Authentic swabian food.< /Review><Time>1554654034379<//Time>< username>

Fun atmosphere and fabulous schnitzel. Not as wafer thin as you can get it in Germany but pounded flat and perfectly cooked. A short but solid beer list and desserts that looked great but I could not even think about after clearing my plate.<//Text>

<review>I love Leopold's! Everyone is always so friendly. The food is very meat centric so keep that in mind. They have a spaetzle that is enormous and delicious though if you lean vegetarian. The sausage and schnitzel are killer and the beer selection is just right. Have yourself a boot and some ribs and you will have one heck of a night.< /review><Resp>None< /Resp><Name>Eric Wheeler<//Name>< user_id>

This place had a warm and authentic ambience, with a great selection of Belgian and German beers, and French wines. The food and dessert were very different from what I have ever tasted. The meat was well cooked and was falling from the bones. The servers were very polite and gave us some good recommendation for the dinner.< /text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>Amazing, delicious food. And the atmosphere making you feel like you're in a real Austria, having a pint (rather a boot of beer). The good was great and perfectly served, I recommend couple of starters and to share a meat platter (which is really amazing!). Prices are considerable. Really recommend this place!</Text>< Pics>

Excellent schnitzel, the breading is particularly crisp and delicious. The spaetzal is excellent and quite rich.

And if you ask for mustard you don't even need to specify with horseradish, they just know :)< /Review>

Traditional Austrian Food and atmosphere combined with friendly staff. Some dishes have a hint of an American touch to it but that's actually a good match!

Try the food with some German or Austrian Beer!

Prost & Mahlzeit!</review>

<Review>This is a fun, German spot with great beer! The food was delicious as well. We had the veggie scramble and waffles with berries. The boots of beer are definitely an experience you won't want to miss. You can share or have one to yourself.  Make sure to give yourselves a few hours to finish the boot - it's a tall order!< /Review></record>

Very happy, warm place. Staff are dressed up in traditional clothing and beaming, seeming keen to ensure you have a good time with your friends. HUGE beer selection as well as a nice succinct menu. So far, everything I've had there has been top notch.

Prices on the entrees can be a bit high, and I often come out spending more than I expected to, simply because we stay longer than we planned. Desserts as well were mildly disappointing, although they're clearly made on-site which I always appreciate.

This will be a go-to for me when I have groups of friends looking to have a meal, a drink, and a good time.<//text>

Leopold's has really tasty food. The staff is dressed in lederhosen and are very kind.  The only place I know of in the city that someone can get a 2 L boot of beer.  You can also get a 5l to share with the table.  The short ribs are outstanding as are all the sausages.< /Text>

Great schnitzel and beer make for a tasty meal. The warm, cozy ambiance is welcoming and comfortable. Don't order a boot (3L) of beer unless you're ready for your night to be over and have a safe way to get home! A great place to celebrate Oktoberfest!</text>

<Text>Yum beer yum beer. Super fun place for a couple or a group.

They don't take reservations but you can show up early to get your name on their list and then go enjoy a drink around the corner or sit outside and relax.

All the food here in fabulous, and the portions are huge! Definitely come with an empty stomach, ready to share, or both. And get a boot! What fun!

Good natured, fun servers. Nothing beats a heavy beer night at Leopold's.< /Text>< pics>

Great traditional German food in Russian Hill.  Wiener Schnitzel and Goulash were both great and authentic.  Beer selection is on point as well with both draft and bottle options.  Keeping with the theme, full liter steins and even bigger boots of beer are available.</Text>

<Review>Delicious German / Austrian food. The house-made pretzel is especially impressive. Leopold's also serves the classics like Wienerschnitzel, Bratwurst with Sauerkraut, and much more. For those looking to get a drink, choose from a variety of beers and beer boot sizes.<//Review>< Pictures>

<Rate>4< /Rate><Text>Cant say much about the food since I just got drinks with my friends. However, it smelled and looked delicious. As for the beers, they have a pretty good selection and varying sized drinking vessels. I went with the 2 liter boot (gotta give em your credit card cause its $50 if you break it) and can say its a lot of beer. I highly recommend this place for any beer enthusiast and challenge you to go for the 5 liter vessel.< /Text>< pics>

Good food, good service. Bit of a line on a thursday night. Expect to pay 16-24 for your entree, and 8-10 for beers. Plus tax and tip.</Text>

Authentic German food. German actually will eat here. Service is friendly, even when it's busy! The portions are great and the quality of the food is outstanding.
Come here when you really want to stop and enjoy a meal. Especially with a bunch of friends.
The jagerschnitzel is outstanding<//review>

I know many regulars are strict on calling the type of food that's served here (Bavarian, Austrian or German), but regardless of which you prefer, most would agree that it's the best of that type of food they've had in San Francisco. When you walk in the door, you're greeted by a friendly host and friendlier owner. The waitresses all wear dirndls and the place has a very Oktoberfest in Munich feel to it with the bench tables. Unfortunately, they do not take reservations but no worries, you can sit yourself at the bar and have a few pints or liters while you wait. Going back to the food, it's simply outstanding. From the pork to beef to schnitzels, everything is full of flavor and very tender.<//review>

This is such a fun place! Hearty Austrian meals here that make you feel good on a cold San Francisco day. I really love the chicken dumpling soup. I usually get the bratwurst and it's great. The only downside is the long wait to get into this restaurant.<//Review>

Amazing food and service!! Just make sure to get there early...seriously...coordinate to you het there early, almost right after they open because it will get crowded and there are no reservations to be made. First come first serve and they will gently turn you away if they are booked for the night. Do yourself a favor and plan ahead to get there early.<//Text>

Always nice service and great food. We usually split a main since they are very large. I love the Jaeger sauce, but am surprised that it is $6 when you ask for extra! Going on a weekday night will get you a quiet table, but going on the weekend gets you an energetic atmosphere that is quite exciting!< /review>

Staff is very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu, both food and drink. Can't personally speak to the drink selections, but the food was incredibly good, but a little pricier than I think it should be. However, I will definitely return when the German/Austrian cravings return.< /review>

Came here on a weeknight in October. Of course Oktoberfest theme all month long. Had a sausage dish, seasonal veggies and beets salad. I totally regret not having their schnitzel and spetzel cause our neighbor table got it and it smelled so good. We thought we were going to try to be healthy. Wrong choice. Sausage was ok. Beet salad was good. Veggies were solid. Next time I'll try the schnitzel and spetzel and maybe give them more stars.<//Review>

I'm German, so I enjoy German food when I can.  This is an Austrian establishment, but it has the food I enjoy!

Leopold's has on tap great beer from Germany.  They include large sizes (more than 2 liters I believe).  My Maß glass was full.

I ordered Schnitzel and it was as I expect.  Tasted very good and cooked in traditional method.  The red cabbage was especially enjoyable and the closest to my German mother's recipe that I have ever had away from home.

We had a 50 minute wait time.  A Maß drink before hand on bench outside helps pass the time.  It was crowded but our party of 6 was comfortable in one of the few booths.  There were larger parties in the center of the restaurant with tables put together.< /Text>

<Text>Food was okay, not worth the price.  Service was fine, until it wasn’t and staff interceded, presumably out of boredom, in a private family matter and tried to convince my 70 year old mother that I was in danger after leaving restaurant.  I wouldn’t make this up, they convinced her to call police.  I don’t know what they were thinking, but the mediocre short ribs lost what little luster the hurried presentation had mustered after that.

They have a good selection of beers, many of which are on tap.  The food is also pretty delicious.  I had the chicken, which I enjoyed quite a bit.

The decor resembles a mountainous Bavarian lodge and is pretty fun.<//Text>

The food as always is fantastic unfortunately the service is hit-and-miss
The staff is incredibly friendly but I feel like I just have bad luck with them having poor attention and slow on getting refills for drinks but once they have the order in their food Runners are fantastic and the food comes out fast and excellent<//review>

Now my place to stop whenever upstate since SF has driven out my favorite German establishments.

Stiegl and franks,  or mehhh! and warm beer out of a box car.  That's easy!

4.5 stars because no mustard selection and stewed kraut.  At least have a hot!.  These are easy and cheap options versus requesting another beer on tap etc.

Oh and make real scotch eggs on the weekend

Cheers!</Text>

All kinds of good beers - available in huge boots from 1-5 liters!  This place is authentic.  Be prepared for a lot of meat.  This was my last meat meal before going on a 2-month long vegan stretch to cleanse the body.  It gets busy - be there at 5:30pm to get a table.< /text>

Leopold's is a great reminder of Eastern Europe with its decorated walls of various road signs and advertisements. The beef goulash was just "okay," but the schnitzel was very good, with not too much batter, and served with lindonberry  sauce.<//Review>

Ok, it's not Bavaria....but it's as close as you can get!

Upon walking into the establishment, I felt as if I walked back in time to when I was at Oktoberfest. It was loud, beer was plentiful and the food was meaty.

A man's dream come true beer comes in large sizes and food is pretty meat on meat. There is a large bench for seating and smaller tables in the corners. It truly was a German experience and I can't wait to go back in my lederhosen!< /text>

Don't know why but food was significantly down from my last visit.
I had a big hunk of beef with little flavor called a rib something.   Sides were average.   Beer is expensive.
Probably no reason to ever go here instead of suppenkuchen.</review>

Very similar to Suppenkuche in Hayes Valley (also has beer in a glass boot), Leopolds is a boisterous, fun place run by the nicest, friendliest people. I normally don't like German/Austrian cuisine, but the limited menu is all quality and good portion sizes. I recommend the Wiener Schnitzel - crispy and tender. Save room for dessert and get the apple strudel, which was flaky and just the right ratio of apple to crust.<//review>

Fabulous atmosphere, great "faux-Austrian lodge" decor, and delicious food. We split the wiener schnitzel and the braised beef short rib, and while both were delicious, the short rib was the better of the two (I mean, it's just hard to beat short rib). For dessert, the apfelstrudel was a great finish. Also, a very nice beer selection. Great experience all around, would definitely go back.<//review>

<Text>Casual, Austrian style restaurant with tasty food.  They have a large beer selection of over 20 beers in sizes from 0.2 litres to a 5 litre mug.  They have a limited food selection of schnitzel, fish, goulash, and salad. But you better like pork.  The schnitzels are all pork and even the fish is wrapped in pork.  The beef goulash was the only non pork hot food and it was excellent.  Salads were also very good as a main course.

Deserts are limited and good but not really Austrian. Linzer torte and apple strudel. No Salzbuger nockerl or real pastries.  It isn't Demel's.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x808580e868c4e2bb:0x19cb77125f42a5e9</gmap_id></record>

<Text>Great German Comfort Food
Great Host - "Klaus"
It is a German Beer Hall that happens to serve food .
The Noise Level is pretty loud.
Brace yourselves ...you might not hear your dinner date .
What's missing ...
The Kitschy ooompa ooompa Germanic Music and the guys should  to be wearing Liederhosen.
Aside from that ...
It's a festive environment with a festive host ...
Drink up and Dive into
Good Comfort Food .</Text></record>

All around a great place to eat. I've been  here a few times and have yet to find something on the menu I did not enjoy.  I am a bit disappointed by their beer selection, they have a few unique ones, but if you want a decent Pils all you can really go for is a Bitburger.< /Review>

<Review>I came here with a huge group of friends (about 12) the other day and Leopold's was very accommodating. I had the Ksesptzle, the Austrian mac and cheese, and it was delicious. The portion was huge and very cheesy just the way I like it. I also tried their Choucroute Garni Platter. Their house-made bratwurst was very tasty as well as their  potatoes. I'm not a huge fan of German food, but this place was pretty tasty.< /Review>< pictures>

< Review>
First off: I am German with Austrian roots and come from a family of gastronomes, so if I write a positive review about an Austrian restaurant in SF, it means something. The food at Leopold's is authentic and really good. The beer selection is excellent. My favorite is the Aktien Zwickl - a specialty from my hometown. If you want to try something out of the ordinary go for the Schlenkerla - a smoked beer that will remind you of ham. This is the real deal including the atmosphere - so unless you plan on visiting Austria or Germany soon, this is as close as it gets.<//Review>

We usually go to Suppenküche in San Fran because they have good southern German food and as we are Germans we like German food a lot:) So we tried Leopold's which is probably more Austrian food but it's almost the same. The service was very friendly! We went for dinner and had the Paprika Beef Goulash which was good. They make the späzle by hand (not by a machine) so they were very good! We also tried the roasted chicken breast "Jäger art". The chicken breast was rather a chicken leg but the herbed dumplings (Semmelknödel) were very good! The only thing was that it was just not enough food. The portions are small so don't try to chare one meal. Overall it's a loud restaurant with a friendly staff and with good food and not to mention the beer boots:) But I still prefer Suppenkueche.< /text>

Great atmosphere on Saturdays, like a gasthaus in Munich, but with younger, more energetic people.  Food is German, 'nuf said.</text>

Perfect for those cold and foggy days. Get the goulash and spaetzle (egg noodles) and try to save room for the strudel!</Review>

(Translated by Google) Amazing food, best German beers and great ambiance!
All the food is delicious and the German draft beer is great. The atmosphere of the shop is also German, which makes you forget that you are in San Francisco. We also recommend Underberg, a medicated liquor that you drink after meals. It improves digestion.

(Original)
Amazing food, best German beers and great ambiance!
すべての料理がおいしく、ドイツの生ビールも最高です。店の雰囲気もドイツっぽい雰囲気で、サンフランシスコにいることを忘れさせます。Underbergという食後に飲む薬用酒もオススメです。消化を良くしてくれます。<//Text>

<review>(Translated by Google) Except for the beer, I can't write much good here. The schnitzels are from the deep fryer "It is on the menu, but you can only see it when you sit at the table" are as thin as a slice of bread and only taste like breading. I believe that every or almost every housewife can do better. A Jägerschnitel, a Viennese-style schnitzel, two wheat beer and an orange juice. . . . $ 90.82 No thanks. And there is no decision for that either. Where do the positive reviews actually come from.

(Original)
Bis auf das Bier , kann ich hier leider nicht viel gutes schreiben. Die Schnitzel sind aus der Fritteuse "Steht zwar auf der Karte, sieht man aber erst wenn man am Tisch sitzt" sind dünn wie eine Scheibe Brot, und schmecken nur nach Panade. Ich glaube dass jede oder fast jede Hausfrau das besser hin bekommt. Ein Jägerschnitel , ein Schnitzel nach Wiener Art , zwei Hefeweizen und ein O-Saft . . . .  90,82 $ Nein Danke. Und dafür gibt es auch keinerlei Entscheidung. Woher kommen eigentlich die Positiven Bewertungen.</review><UserId.>115751137939767768314< /UserId.></record></dataset><record>

(Translated by Google) There are German and Austrian dishes here. I enjoyed it very much and it was a welcome change to burgers and steaks. In addition a freshly tapped Veltins. The restaurant seems to be very popular and accordingly crowded and noisy. It's best to be there early enough.

Hier gibt es deutsche und österreichische Gerichte. Mir hat es sehr gut geschmeckt und es war eine willkommene Abwechslung zu Burgern und Steaks. Dazu ein frisch gezapftes Veltins.

<Text>(Translated by Google) Good food, especially the French fries are highly recommended, but in my opinion it doesn't seem very serious if the waiter, who unfortunately didn't speak German (of course not a "must", had brought the whole thing across better), on his own initiative % Tips.

Gutes Essen, vor allem die Pommes sind sehr empfehlenswert, jedoch wirkt es meiner Meinung nach nicht sehr seriös, wenn sich der Kellner, der leider auch kein Deutsch sprach (natürlich kein "Muss", hatte das Gesamte besser rübergebracht), von sich aus 25% Trinkgeld gibt.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x808580e868c4e2bb:0x19cb77125f42a5e9< /gmapID></record>

(Translated by Google) "wiener" schnitzel from the pig for $ 23?
Wiener schnitzel is veal - and nothing else!
The very worst Austrian food is served here - and outrageously expensive!
I was ashamed to have been here with my US friends!
McD or KFC is better and cheaper!
Bath and overpriced
Avoid at all costs!

(Translated by Google) We went one day for lunch and another for dinner (a group of 6 people) and would go back to try some other dish. The setting is well achieved and the dishes are not scarce.

Very rich food, both main course and desserts.

Also recommended for people who like to taste beers
