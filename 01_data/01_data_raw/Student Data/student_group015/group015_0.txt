<review>Got my second vaccination here. Guy saw my form and "corrected" my race to white after asking if I'm Latino (I'm not). Then he misspelled Walgreens on my vaccination card. Otherwise fine experience.</review></record>

< review>
Your typical 24 hr Walgreens. Only major store nearby that's 24/7 so it does get busy at times. RX gets busy during the day but it's not as bad at night. Employees are mostly friendly. The overnight pharmacist doesn't always go on their lunch break on time, so you might have to wait extra if you're coming in for the pharmacy around 2AM.< /review>

<Text>Long wait time, had to wait an hour despite of having a scheduled appointment. Unprofessional staff, and no proper communication. If you want to get vaccinated better go anywhere else.<//Text><date>1621903505885<//date>< GmapID>

The store is fine, your typical Walgreens.  I just want to warn people during this COVID time that using their online ordering for pick-up at this location is terrible.  I placed an order, came to pick it up and clicked on the "I'm here" on the app so they could come out.  After waiting half an hour, they still hadn't come out.  I tried calling and they didn't pick up their phone.  I finally left, only to get a notice that I had picked up my order.  I tried to use the online customer service, but was #172 in line.  I tried to call the 800 number, but couldn't get through.  I finally went inside and it took 3 different employees nearly half an hour to figure out what to do with me.  Ugh, just go inside and shop, don't think you'll get to pick up your order there.</Review>

<text>I am a big fan of this Walgreens Pharmacy. Its proximity makes its very easy to get to and the 24/7 availability is fantastic. They provide good friendly service, and are very conscientious in ensuring your prescription is filled in a timely manner. Their pharmacists are both professional and friendly. They are easy to approach and when needed provide clear instructions on the use of new medications as well as reminders on the use of refills. They and their staff guide and encourage the use of and sign up for auto refills and text alerts. I would highly recommend this Walgreens Pharmacy to everyone.< /text><Rate>5< /Rate><name>Lupe Martinez</name><Time>1599761028378</Time>< gmap_id>

Wait is really long. Waited in line for 10 minutes and then was told to wait in another window. No clear sign for drop off. Such a waste of time. The Asian woman working here is extremely rude and barely speaks English. She belongs in a cheap Chinese restaurant than a pharmacy. Will not be coming here ever again. There seems to be a shortage of pharmacies in Mountain View since this place is packed on a weekday night. Unbelievable.</Text>

They asked us to wait 15 to 20 minutes but we heard nothing for two hours. On protesting they didn't even have the courtesy to talk to us, just ignored us. I would recommend people who need medicine for immediate relief to not even enter this building.< /Text>

Hi Walgreens Corporate: Please let it be known that after vigorously searching which store is open during this virus epidemic, not only was I truly grateful for the Mountain View store to be open twenty-four hours, but your friendly staff member, William, who actually recalled speaking to me over the phone (even with my medical voice loss condition), demonstrated how passionately he cared about people and their specific needs!! This level of old fashioned customer service does not exist in today's world. I believe William is a great role model. I was disappointed with most of the household supplies disappearing and the fact that your store does not take efficient aftercare responsibility for eyeglass defect. Upon inquiring this issue with William, he suggested his girlfriend's work place where they might be of assistance. Why do you decline to maintain eyeglass repair? This makes no sense. Thank you.</text>

I've had pretty mediocre experiences here with slow staff, but they recently had trouble filling a medication, gave me no updates until I called them again, then they told me it wouldn't be in stock for 2 weeks and told me to call another place. I firmly requested they do the call using their system, which they did, but still a hassle. That and the fact that the shopping center is pretty sketchy and has beggars that they clearly can't be bothered to deal with.< /Text>

Total lack of confidentiality! I heard a pharmacist loudly tell a man “we’re only giving you 15 pain pills because we don’t want you to overdose!”, they continued to walk over to the general pick up area and loudly discuss antidepressants, antibiotics and hormone replacement meds with customers. Heaven forbid anyone expecting to keep their diagnosis to themselves!</review>

If you consider the photo or FedEx drop off/pick up service here, forget it. I wait here 20min today while the casher keep calling the lady to come. When she finally came, she just says "I was in the pharmacy" with a cold face. What a bad day.< /Text>

Waiting time is extreme long. When I picked up my medicine, their system had some problem and couldn't process my insurance card, the officer asked me to pay full price and let me contact the insurance company myself. So I have to pay much more than I should be and call my insurance, which is really annoying. After several days, they called me at 6:00am and wake my kids and me up. I was told they can process my insurance card now, and my next prescription will be covered 90%. People in this Walgreen shows no respect to customers.<//Text>

Very bad service in pharmacy
Too slow, so many people working inside the pharmacy and too much wait. They told me that my prescription was going to be in 30 minutes and I finally wait 1hr and half and each time I asked how long does it take, they just said 15 minutes 15 minutes and it becomes 1.5hr
Please go to another pharmacy do not waste your time<//Text>

I am impressed with the pharmacist Melanie, she is very kind and intelligent. She sees the prescription very carefully
and point outs any side effect ( which sometimes doctors can forget to tell)

The whole pharmacy staff is very good in this store. I would always have my prescription pick up from this Walgreens rather than any other pharmacy store.

5 stars for pharmacy here... Thank you and keep doing great things.</text>

A 24-hour pharmacy is hard to find.  If that's what you need, you found it.

Yes, people always ask for money on the way out. But it's always just one person asking, as if they take turns, and they usually are seated.

The wait is a little above average for a pharmacy, and varies a lot.< /text>

<Text>It took them over an hour to fill a simple prescription for Amoxicillin Clavulanate in suspension, which is a bog standard antibiotic. Literally all they had to do was add water to powder in a bottle and shake it. To add insult to injury, our infant daughter vomited up all the medication an hour after taking it. Vomiting wasn't a symptom of her sickness, it was pretty clearly caused by the medication. We are never getting prescriptions filled here again. I'll happily drive an hour in the middle of the night to get to any other 24 hour pharmacy. If you can't, it's probably safer to wait it out until morning rather than trust these incompetent people with your medications.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

<text>I have been buying medicines here for more than a year and a half now.  I should say that I have always had a good experience.  The staff is very courteous, the pharmacists take time to explain the medication and dosages to you and take questions well too.  There is clear separation between the window to drop off your prescription and the window where you need to collect your medications.  After the doctor sends the prescription to the pharmacy, when the prescription is ready, the pharmacy calls you to take the medicine.  When you are due for a refill, the pharmacy calls you and asks you for your options.  I have ordered a refill using the automated system and it was ready for pickup when I went there.  If the medicines are costly and you don't have an insurance (my father did not), you can buy a smaller number of tablets than the number prescribed and come back again for more if needed.  For over the counter medications, the staff is very helpful to come and search with you and recommend you what you want.<//text>< rate>

I usually use a different Walgreen's near my house but, due to circumstances beyond my control, had to pick up a prescription after that pharmacy closed.  I just want to say KathyJo gets one massively exuberant thank you from me for making things not be terrible.  Normally, when I encounter a health-related obstacle, the humans in the situation shrug and say there's nothing they can do about it.  KathyJo didn't do that and absolutely made my night, my weekend, and the rest of my month.  When it feels like you're constantly battling health insurance companies and the medical industry at large, one less battle means SO much.< /Review>

Let's start with the fact that it is a 24hr pharmacy. Great. Then look at the obvious. The beggars here are 24hrs and are quite aggressive. They will shoot heroin anywhere near the building use the sidewalk as their restroom and don't have a problem harrassing you coming and going. This place is a transient dream since they seem to get a $20 bill every five minutes by someone who falls for their scam. Please donate to community services. (They actually help with anything one might need) the worst part of this place besides the strung out vagrants is that they removed the handicap parking. If you actually have mobility issues and need to safely transfer from your car I would not recommend this place. It is extremely dangerous for anyone who is physically vulnerable and the vagrants run the outside of this building. This corner is super infested with aggressive panhandlers. I dread picking up prescription orders from here since I have been followed by beggars from start to finish of my experience and have even had one women shoving everything she could get ahold of in the store onto her body while trailing me. It was frightening. Would never come here alone after dark or without a can of pepper spray and bringing a child here isn't exactly comforting. The bathroom here is beyond disgusting and it is another have all your immunizations, a strong immune system and heaven help you if you are physically disabled and need to pick something up from here. About as close to a skid row as you can get in mountain view. The police seem to be trying to get this storefront under control but as long as people are giving cash, the boozers will keep calling it home base.<//Text>

Same item was marked with 2 different prices in 2 places in store. Rewards programs is deceptive. Item was marked in large print "5000 points" so I bought it. Turns out there was fine print that required me to buy other obscure items to get points. Fine print was about 1/6 the font size of the points font. Deceptive and poor practice.</Text>

<Review>They are trying to save money by turning off their air conditioner. No air conditioner nor ventilation in the pharmacy? You've got to be kitting me!!!! I almost passed out in line trying to buy my medications. Also, as far as I know, sick people are the ones using pharmacies a lot. Don't they know that viruses are thriving the most in hot, badly ventilated places.Not to mention their pharmacy service is slow and they often don't have drugs in stock.</Review>< Time>

Lely and Carlos gave terrible customer service. Will never return to this location again!

I go to Walgreens all the time, and all the other staff are other locations are simply kind and helpful. Instead of assisting me at another register because their machine was down and taking a while to process transaction, they opened two other registers and assisted other customers before allowing me to be assisted at another register. In addition, the tellers Carlos and Lely were rude/and gave smart remarks when I asked to be helped at a different register, and even then, I was told to wait while watching Carlos help 2-3 more customer transactions after Lely sent me to be helped at his station.     I was in line before a line formed. In addition, the average amount I spend at Walgreens is close to $200, so I was very disappointed in service I received. Currently, this location has a total rating  of 2.5 stars. I guess next time I'll pay attention to ratings by location before attending my usual favorite conveince stores< /text>

Zero star for this.  I am mistakenly selected this for infant son medicine pickup. I had to wait for 45 minutes to pick up my son medicine with my sick son waiting in the car(in cold ). we have to stand in long queues two times for pick up. first time for them to take order. we have to stand again to pickup the medicine. they need to fix this.  never going back there. you can go there if you ready to wait for 45 minutes<//review>

I don't even think they even deserve a star at all. Worst of all, they are giving you medicines that don't have a seal. For my dad, they missed the dosages and when they told to us that his medication is ready, they said that it wasn't ready.</Text>

This is my go-to pharmacy because it's open 24-hours, but the service is pretty poor.  There is usually a line at the pharmacy counter, but it moves pretty quickly and the staff will try to accommodate you by filling your prescription while you wait.<//Text>

Pharmacy is a disgrace. Rude, slow, over officious. Made me wait for over an hour to get pain medicine and antibiotics my 6 year old daughter desperately needed post op as they wanted to "investigate" whether the prescription was correct. Ended up having to get the surgeon out of bed to call them before they reluctantly handed over the meds (not before at last minute attempt to up sell me on different antibiotic flavors). Communication skills of staff non existent. If they spent a little less time joking about the hand writing skills of the doctors and more time on customer care they might offer at least a tolerable experience. Strong recommendation never to use this branch of Walgreens (or indeed Walgreens as this branch represents this company)<//Text>

<Text>There should be an option for negative stars.
Every time I came here it's extremely slow. Pharmacists are so slow, don't respond properly during consultation and are usually rude like old aunties! Extremely incompetent staff!< /Text><pics>None</pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

On the plus side, this location has a 24 hour pharmacy.  They're also easy to get to by car from the freeways, being at the very end of 237 where it meets Grant Road.  (If you're coming from 85 southbound, take the Grant Road exit and turn left at the light; then make the first right into its parking lot.)

If you need their pharmacy after hours, be prepared to wait in a long line of people, many of whom are coughing and sneezing.  If your doctor has phoned in your prescription, make sure to call in advance to verify that they have filled the prescription, and get the name of the person who says it has been filled.  Otherwise you may stand in a long line only to find that they have no record of the prescription!  They do this _frequently_.

This is not a fancy Walgreens like you'd find in Palo Alto.  This is an old Walgreens, plain but servicable, with a working-class clientele.</text>

<Text>Called in to have my prescription filled here, was told it would be ready in 30 mins.
Waited in line for 20 minutes, then was told that it's not yet ready. 15 mins later it was ready.
Point is - it's ok to take 1 hour to fill the prescription, just tell me ahead of time. Don't make me wait in store.<//Text>< Pictures>

AMAZING service. Been coming here for a few years now and they never disappoint. They are not close to us but we always drive over here for the delicious food with endless options and how sweet the owners are. Their menu has so many options and they are always so helpful with recommendations on trying new things. This place is such a gem !!<//Review>

This is the best place I’ve been to in all of LA so far and they have a huge menu with a lot of vegan options which are also amazing. The orange chicken is my favorite, and even the vegan option tastes just like it. Beef fried rice is good too! This place is a must try.</Text>< Pictures>

Well if they wanted to try this place for a while very interesting because it has regular selections and vegetarian vegan selections. So I was enthused!  Once I opened the door I actually had to wait a few minutes then call out before somebody new I was waiting to order. I will say there are 2 nice things about the place once you break the ice with the owner service was very good Is food was fairly simple no heavy sauces in what I ordered Is the food tasted fresh and very flavourful but simple ingredients 2 dishes and an appetiser. There was a decent amount of food That could feed 2 people. But every dish is around the 18 to $20 price range even the appetiser was expensive total bill was over $63 for 2 people for take out at a Chinese joint I think is overpriced. I also cannot say the meal was worth it or spectacular. It was good. The only exception I can come to or conclusion is it's in the calabas as area so the price point is higher. I dined in at a Latin restaurant instrument oaks a few weeks ago service was impeccable Drinks and so much food everything was tasty excellent an exceptional bill was just under $40 This was appetiser salad and a full meal plate. Hence the 3 stars.< /text>

<name>memintTi< /name><Text>I had such a wonderful time here. Kim and Don are such amazing people. They care so much about their food as they brought us the incredible food here. I love their shrimp so much, they were very fresh and big shrimps, taste really good but I don’t know what it’s called. I told her I like shrimp and spicy and she chose the right menu for me! If I can give them more than 5 stars, it could be 10 stars or even more. They totally deserve it :D<//Text></record>

Tasty but pricey. Had a Szechwan dish and some soup, everything tastes very nice and the presentation is good! I agree with another comment that it’s a little “touristy” but overall the ambience is nice, the staff is courteous and the food is just above average.<//Text>

I informed her that I grew up with Asian neighbors and that I was used to homemade Asian food. She then said trust me I'll make you something good. She brought out the most delicious dish colossal shrimp with favors of turmeric and lemongrass with a side of white rice. They are also known for their vegan food.</Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN4AvZYBTXzJfhf8ucF4fYYmot5L2zTBcJTq3e-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< Resp>

< review>
High-end Chinese fusion in Agoura Hills? I'm in!

Mandarin Lotus is located right off the 101 freeway on Kanan Road. I never knew this place existed until my friend started raving about it a few weekends ago at the Chili Cook Off. Based on what she said, I knew I needed to go check it out. I was not disappointed.

To my surprise, this restaurant was established in 1988. Formerly known as Mandarin Express, this restaurant specializes in Michelin-inspired Eurasian cuisine, with unique molecular gastronomy techniques and recipes. Fusion recipes include tastes from many cuisines, including French, Spanish, and Thai, to name a few. Their ingredients are definitely high quality and fresh.

I've been here a couple times now, and both times were excellent. This is definitely elevated Chinese cuisine, and they have very interesting items on the menu. Their menu is actually huge, with countless options to choose from ranging from low price to very expensive high-end. I've only been for lunch, so I've only gone cheap with the broccoli beef lunch special, but I am curious about a number of their other items. I will say, the broccoli beef is very good here, and the rice is cooked to perfection.

If you've never been, I'd definitely say this is a worthwhile restaurant to visit if you're in the area. Service is very nice, but maybe not the quickest. They do cook all of their food fresh to order, so this isn't much of a complaint, just a heads up to those in a rush. Due to the proximity to my office, I'll likely be back soon. Go ahead and give it a try for yourself!<//review>

<Text>At the risk of sounding hyperbolic, this is the best Asian Vegetarian/Vegan food in Los Angeles and environs....and possibly in the known universe. The care that Dan takes with his amazingly original recipes is astonishing. And his wife Kim, who does everything else, is the loveliest person imaginable.  We have eaten here dozens of times, trying all the vegan things listed on the menu that I have never seen anywhere else and are always blown away.  Its a new standard of excellence for vegan food!< /Text>< UserId.>

<Review>Stopped by on a whim because the restaurant I had meant to go to was closed. The owner was extremely nice and welcoming, and helped me order off a rather large menu. The food was delicious, and exquisitely plated and presented. Well worth the cost, and I'm sure I'll go again.<//Review><gmapID>0x80e826ab6e3b9443:0xb12aabb77ef4d1b3< /gmapID></record>

A week ago my husband and I were traveling through Calabasas from Las Vegas, NV and fortunately found Mandarin Lotus. The food was fresh, healthy, delicious.... actually very very delicious! We called in and placed an order for pick up, when we arrived Dan met us near the entrance and greeted us personally. They gave us complimentary mango rolls and a few mandarins! Prices are very fair for what you get, portions are big, food is really very delicious and made to order. They have a very big menu to choose from half of which are vegetarian and vegan options!
Next time we'll be in California this will be the first place to visit!

Thank you Dan and Kim for such an incredible experience!< /text>< pics>

The menu here is extensive, and every dish is cooked to order fresh. As someone with multiple food allergies, I appreciated the fact that the dishes were fully customizable since they are made to order- I knew I had nothing to worry about from an allergy standpoint.

We came tonight (Father's Day) as a large group with multiple, let's just say, difficult personalities. Although the service was a little slow, it was only one person working front of house, one working the back, so they absolutely were doing the best they could. Patience paid off, as the food was absolutely delicious. There was not a single dish that was off in any way shape or form. In fact, a couple of the dishes were made with vegetarian meat, and 2 beef conissuers accidentally ate one of the mock beef dishes and had no idea they did- it was that good.  In the future, with a large group, I may consider ordering to go, but as I mentioned, patience pays off dining in. Looking forward to returning in the future.< /Text>

<Review>One of my favorite places for Mandarin cuisine. I love everything on the menu. A little pricey but the portions are LARGE! Kim takes care of all customers.

Dan and Kim are the best! Everything on the menu is mouthwateringly delicious! They also have lots of gluten free options that are amazing! The gluten free orange chicken is out of this world! Kim is so attentive and sweet and Dan makes the most delicious and beautifully presented food. I’ve been coming here for years and I am still working my way through their incredibly extensive menu! No matter what I try, it’s always amazing!</review>

<Text>BEST PLACE EVER!!!
The most delicious chinese food I’ve ever had! I’ve eaten at many Michelin restaurants over the years and Chef Dan is truly Michelin quality. He has raised the bar on what Chinese Fusion can be. The food is plated beautifully and that is just the beginning of your satisfying experience. Chef Dan has the gift of flavor. The combination of a wide array of ingredients and spices are inspired by different parts of the world. The explosion of diverse flavors play an ineffable symphony on your taste buds.
This is a most come place!
Chef Dan and Kim are the best!!! I am a customer for life!!!< /Text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

Excellent little find with an amazingly large menu! Lots and lots of vegetarian options. I tried the pineapple cashew fried rice and it was one of the best I've ever had. Highly recommended.</Review>

Mandarin Lotus serves the most amazing Chinese/fusion food. Everything is so delicious. Kim and Dan are not only a wonderful people and proprietors but also extremely creative. Chicken and beef options are outstanding according to our family meat eaters and I find the vegetarian options to be so unique and tasty (Wish I could be more specific, but I always order whatever they recommended and it is always spot on!).. this place is a gem!</review>

<Text>Food was ok at best. Clearly catering to the tourist. The spicy Won Ton was outstanding everything else was slightly better than mall food court or Panda Express Chinese food.  One saving grace might be the sizzling platters. Everyone else ordered them we didn't. Our mistake possibly.</Text><Rating>4< /Rating><response>None< /response>< Time>

Two bowls of soup, an appetizer of two small soft shell crabs, one dinner of pork ribs- d-boned and deep fried (very dry) with a lot of over cooked onions, too small pieces of red pepper and about 10 green beans.   We did get two egg rolls on the house and two small pieces of mango compliments of the house for $75.00.  I was also reprimanded for asking for a second refill of ice tea.  They only give one refill.  They have been there 30 years and for the life of me I  can't figure out how that happened???<//Review></record></dataset><record>

This is THE BEST Chinese cuisine I've ever had. I don't live anywhere nearby but I always come here whenever I'm in Agoura. The salt and pepper calamari is absolutely fantastic. Hands down the best. The Kelsey Grammar chicken is always a good choice as well. Very friendly, family run business. I only wish I lived closer!< /Text>

Amazing food one of the best in the area. Top it off they offer an amazing Gluten Free menu for those of us that are gluten sensitivity/Celiac. I have yet to ever have a reaction. My favorite dish is the Kelsey Grammar Orange chicken. One of the best hidden gems in Agoura.</review>

This 'hole-in-the-wall' actually has great food - high quality and well prepared. The owners are always looking to be of service. The food isn't cheap, but the product is more than worth it. Vegetarians have a full menu of "mock" meat dishes that cannot be beat. Celebrities often drop in.<//Text>

the food was not what i am used to when eating Chinese. it wasn't horrible, but it was not good. i later discover that the dishes are "healthier versions" of typical Asian entrees. If that is your thing then this place is for you. PLENTY of vegetarian options. be sure to bring sanitizer and/or use restroom beforehand for there is no restroom for guests dining in. The cook and server were very kind, happy people.</review>

The honey chicken and the sesame chicken tasted exactly the same. We ordered the BBQ ribs and while they were good... there were 4 pieces in the order. The egg flower soup was flavorless except for too much pepper. Not great.</Review><Resp>None</Resp>< pictures>

Do not understand the high ratings.  Ate there twice and it was horrible.  When I first saw the extensive menu I thought I was in heaven but what is on the menu and what you get served are very different.  I've only been there for lunch and they only had one guy (the owner) in the kitchen.</text>

So, this is my seventh year living in Oak Park, and the first time that I've been to this amazing hole in the wall restaurant!    I'd always been vaguely aware of this nondescript restaurant - it's squeezed in a tiny space in a strip mall,  near the karate center, Nick Rail's music,  behind the IHOP, and way behind the Jack in the Box at the corner of Kanan and the 101 off-ramp.  I guess it was the "Express" in the name which made me think it was something like "Panda Express" - take out pseudo-Chinese junk food.  Or maybe it was the small restaurant space and buffet-like store counter which you can see through the front windows, also reminiscent of a fast food take out restaurant.  Panda Express it most definitely is not.  Mandarin Express is of all things a fancy gourmet restaurant!   Chinese-Mediterranean-Californian fusion food.   They take some basic Chinese food ingredients and cook it with a variety of vegetables and spices from around the world. You can eat an all-vegetarian meal here!  There's an entire page of mock duck/chicken/shrimp/pork dishes.   But their shrimp and other meat dishes are terrific too.  The food just bursts with multiple flavors in your mouth.  I really think they should re-name the place, or at least take out the "Express" part from the name.  It just doesn't do the place justice.  The owner-cooks are really friendly too.  A great place to take your best friends and family!</text>

<text>Apart from the fact, Mr owner ripped us off and charged us automatically on the bill a service charge, the place was ok. We had to ask for many, waited about half hour for the food and then charged $55 for two mains (rice included) and two glasses of water. We were stupid to tell him we are from UK so i guess he tried his luck on the service charge and he succeeded. Shame we did not know the US customs. Food nice but I have had better in that price range. We will surely come never again (what the owner knew) :)<//text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

My son went here a lot when he lived in the area. So he chose it for his birthday dinner. When we got there it was obvious the owners knew him and had missed him. They asked about one of his friends that had passed away. In fact everyone that came in that night gave and received personal and warm greetings. It was like a family gathering.

What could inspire such happiness beyond cordial friendliness?

The food! It was close your eyes and luxuriate awesome!

While my son and I noticed changes to the orange chicken, it was still delicious. This is not a static restaurant. It's fusion. They learn and incorporate from a variety of food cultures. So the OC (which BTW we never found in China) they reimagined was great - no skimping on anything.

We tried the shrimp they recommended but declined to eat it shell and all (if you've been to China you know about exoskeleton delicacies - a taste we haven't acquired). But even though we took off the shells, the seasoning was too incredible not to nibble off from the usually discarded shell. And the seasoning on the included vegetables led to who gets the last one squabbles.

Mongo beef - great. Cashew chicken- great. Chicken fried rice - ok anywhere else but with how everything else was spiced to perfection it suffered by comparison but was still enjoyable.

There were many other artistic and culinary touches that enhanced the food experience. This is not a decor destination. This is about the food and people dedicated to their craft and growing with it. And genuinely loving it.

My wif and I loved it too. It's now on our list to return in a month for a date night.

I hope you'll try it and love it too.

Be seeing you!< /Review>

They try to entice customers by offering free appetizers and some other free stuff, please dont fall for this trick of theirs, they will charge extra somewhere else and compensate for it. Here all dishes are 19 - 20 $. Please dont waste your money here.. i am ready to pay this amount if the taste was good< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< userid>

Their creations are amazing such as orange cinnamon glazed veggie beef over rice.  They are going through a very difficult time right now, so please support them if you can.
Thanks.

The tofu here is out of this world!  It rivals Cafe Yumm in Oregon. This is the best Chinese food ever ! it's healthy good food. One person had sweet and sour chicken and loved it.
I had French basil tofu and someone else had the classic Szechuan Tofu. We will be back again and again!< /text>

<review>OK, I'm not picky when I'm starving, but this food was awful! I'll never go there again. We had chicken and broccoli, pork fried rIce and "random" meat potstickers. The only thing good was the broccoli, no lie. Today is Chinese New Year so we thought we'd splurge and get Chinese food from a new place for us. I'm not sure how long it's been around, but this was the first and LAST time we'll go there. Seriously, I've  never written a bad review on Yelp, but this place motivated me to type!!< /review>< Pictures>

I won't be coming back. I got the lunch special and the food was way overpriced for the food you are getting (small portions, wonton didn't have any filling, egg roll wasn't fresh). On top of this, they charge extra for soup when it is pretty standard for lunch specials at Chinese places to include soup (mind you, the others are charging half the price)! One last chance for redemption: service...service was slow, even when there was only one other person in the restaurant.<//review>

Delicious food,  great staff.  I've been coming here for one year now and have explored much of the menu,  but there is still more to try (menu has well over three hundred + items). Fresh &  healthy, what more could you ask for?

Try the traditional dishes,  or be adventurous and check out Chang's Signature Creations on the menu.  Either way you can't go wrong.

I've never been kicked out of a laundromat before--even back in the days when I was young and maybe drunk and obnoxious while washing my clothes! Amazingly, this place asked me to leave because, supposedly, I had taken "too long" and had been there "all day."
It's a nice facility, just don't plan to take your time with doing things like sorting your wash or carefully folding your clothes.< /Text>

<Review>The P Laundromat is very clean and has brand new washers and dryers. The laundromat carts can be taken outside so you can transport your detergent and laundry hamper into the laundromat.

The owners/managers are very nice and hospitable.

You will be provided free soap with every wash!

If you post on GOOGLE and the owners/managers are in the laundromat ask for a free laundry hamper bag! It is a huge laundry bag and is very nice!</Review>< Pictures>

There is a sports meet arranged in our school. So we needed a very well trained unarmed security guard who should handle school kids very well. First Security service arranged a perfect security guard who had done the job in an extraordinary way. We will surely use your services again.<//text>

Security guards are the most critical part of our business. Securing such a huge perimeter filled with massive machinery is not so easy. Especially, our yard is located far away from the city. We tried a few renowned security services, and First security services is the only place we felt the level of professionalism and expertise.</text>

Something I admire about First Security Service is how their private security officers offer around the clock communications. When I had an issue with my business security, they offered communication support of the highest caliber, and I believe it's the best I have experienced so far.< /review>

FSS has always come through for me, whether it be an event, function, or birthday party. Call me paranoid but I’m just one of those people who needs security present around a crowd of a lot of people. I don’t trust people’s self control so when I hire First Security I feel much more secure. The crews here are consummate professionals. They have good posture, great alertness, and can spot a problem coming minutes before it happens. I’ve witnessed this firsthand. My last business with them was 3 weeks ago and it was lovely and pleasant as always. I recommend these guys to anyone who needs security.<//text>

<text>The overall experience with First Security is always great.  I manage logistics at a construction company and get to work a lot with various security agencies. I have had problems with most companies plus they charge very high.  First Security has been providing many of our construction sites with a great service; we have had no complaints about them at any time.  The guards are active, well-behaved, cooperative, and very personable.  We will continue to recommend them and hire them for all our future projects.</text>< Time>

You really feel a dearth of armed and unarmed security guards for enhanced security. I am more than glad that got to ride on First Security Services’ coattails for my office’s security concerns. Thanks Joanna, for recommending me these amazing guys! This company is seriously top-notch and the most trusted one in town – I vouch for it! Thanks a ton!</Review>

If you don’t mind people taking your safety and security more seriously than you do, then you want to get First Security Guards. Somehow I have been sleeping better since they’ve been watching my house. I think that’s what good security should do.</text>

Had them spread out on the perimeter to look for drug deals, fights, things of this nature. In fact, one of them actually witnessed a drug deal go down and kicked the persons out accordingly. I was very pleased I could depend on them for extra keen eyes and affirmative action. If you need some protection, do not hesitate to call these people up. I definitely recommend them. Superb service.<//text>< pics>

<Text>It seems that many staff in office have very bad attitudes (San Jose Branch) and account managers shows favoritism, (Omar) for instance hires alot if his friends and finds reasons to terminate people so he can hire his (people/friends.) He's rude. Honestly I've  never had to deal with this much strain from my account managers ever in my 6 yrs working security. I truly hope that whomevers taking over that San Jose Branch finds out how he performs unrighteous acts and help clean up with more professionalism because alot of mistreated employees are going unheard and I don't believe that's fair at all. I believe that the employees make the company and should be treated with respect and humanity.< /Text>< pics>

<Text>For our Annual Sales Meet, we needed some security personnel because the hall we booked would not provide them. We contacted First Security Service for some Temporary Security guards. We had our event planner liaise with them directly. The whole security was taken care of seamlessly. Great job done by First Security Service guards. Highly recommended.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

We have been working with First Security Services for more than an year now. All the guards that have been stationed on our sites were both friendly and professional.  They were very knowledgeable when it came to their jobs. We have always been able to trust them and depend on them. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them to anyone.</Text>

Having worked in law enforcement myself, I take security seriously. And when I retired to start my own business, I needed people who feel the same way as I do. First Security’s private guards are not your everyday guards. They are like your private army. Very efficient, conscious, and dedicated.<//Text>

I once used a service of two guard men for my lady in her rally, just as expected; they were up to the task. She felt safe with them even before leaving me for the rally, turned out to be a success. Kudos!<//text>

My husband and I just recently held a birthday party for my 6 year old. To ensure his safety and that nothing would get out of hand, we hired First Security Service staff to patrol and supervise the party. Throughout the whole event they were professional and constantly looking and surveying. I was very satisfied with the way my son’s party went.</Review>

First Security Services did a wonderful job – helped us get a really good and trustworthy (if I should say that) guard to combat a bit of a security snafu that we were struggling with. There’s a sense of relief now and all thanks to this company for that. Thanks a lot!< /review><Rate>5</Rate>< date>

Over the years, I have had various bad experiences with security companies for their unreliability, and I was anxious when I wanted to book someone for an event.

However, your security service did more than its best to help us all feel protected and stop the break-in. Seriously, when a man risks himself to save you, you know that you’re in safe hands. That’s what we felt with your guards’ services. Thank you so, so much!</Text>< pictures>

Got to hear about them through John my co-worker; told me he used them during the company’s New Year eve’s batch. He sound convincing so I made use of them in my district campaign, the team I used were great and calm, not until you  are told, you won’t know what they do (like I wanted). They did join in the campaign with a high level of consciousness bringing everything into order all through the day. I’m using them on my tour this week.</review>

<text>I consulted quite a few reliable sources in my business as to what security company to hire and they all unanimously referred me to First Security Service. FSS was a little more expensive than the other companies that we received quotations from, but we went with what everyone suggested and hired FSS. They managed an exhibition organized by our company very well, though it was a massive project for us, but FSS handled the whole thing effortlessly due to their years of experience in managing major events across the city. The management personally visited and made sure everything was going fine which definitely meant a lot to us. We would definitely hire First Security Service again in the future.</text>< gmapID>

Do not work for this company. They refuse to pay what you work if you work over time they refuse to pay you. This company has been sued twice for not paying their employees. I have no idea why they haven't sued Omar Noory. He is a terrible manager that ignores your calls. You can't go to the office to talk to him because everytime they claim he isnt there. Do not work here it will be a waste of your time.</Text>

Painful process.... love Costco but this tire buying experience has been awful :( due to covid  I ordered my tires online and never received  a call, email or notification when they  arrived.   I checked the tracking number every single day for almost 2 weeks no updates... then it showed that someone  signed for the delivery  it didn't show the date. Immediately I came to the shop Alan was very helpful and professional but my tires were no where to be found  :( the guy that  signed up for the delivery wasn't even working there anymore 😑  had to come back on the following day, they are handling the process of  returning the old order  and purchasing  the  new ones. Next time I'm just going to  come to the office  instead of buying  online ☹</review>

If you want to wait 4 HOURS!!! for them to call you to tell you they are barely pulling your car in to see if there is a leak... then go ahead. Waste of my damn time.

<Text>I am very happy with Costco tire services, price it very reasonable, timing is good, clean place to visit. Tire rotation services are excellent and free, the best part is they inflation your tires with nitrogen air.< /Text>< rate>

<rating>1< /rating><text>Had my tires rotated on Nov 25th, 2018 and was told that I would be getting a replacement tire under the road hazard warranty. I was quoted 4-6 weeks before I would get my tire. I called the second week of January and they said they had no record of me requesting a tire or even purchasing my tires through Costco. I physically went back into the store and went through the whole entire process again. I called back after four weeks and was told, yet again, they had no record of my purchase or replacement order. The guy working in the tire center told me to go to discount tire and buy a new tire because Costco "can't get the tire" but they would install it if I went somewhere else and got it. I told him I'd rather just have them order it and cover it under the warranty seeing as I've now paid full price for the tire and $50 TWICE to have the tire ordered.

So, I eventually ended up (on total accident; without requesting) having the department manager helping me the third time I went in. Tire was ordered (after I again paid for the warranty coverage price, $150 later) and would be there in 4-6 days. The tire has come according to the voicemail I received.

I have been trying to schedule an appointment to have the tire installed for pretty much an entire day.  I've been hung up on before even speaking with an employee. As of posting it has been around three and a half months and I still have no tire. I've never experienced such horrible customer service at any other Costco in the 15+ years of membership. I'm incredibly disappointed and frustrated because it really shouldn't be this difficult, I don't even have an uncommon tire.  I hope that the management or corporate is able to come in and motivate the staff to provide a more streamline, quality service. I'm pretty sure this department is in violation of the corporate standards and definitely needs an overhaul.

I wouldn't recommend going here for service. Save yourself the headache and go somewhere else.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

This is by far the worst experience I have ever had here. If I could rate this 0 stars I would. The customer service is horrible. I cannot believe they would not serve the customers including me who were in line for awhile when they were just going to close. Since they were just going to close, a worker who is probably new there because I have never seen him work there all of the times I have been here decided it would be a great idea to cut the whole line off instead of taking our orders. There was seriously 3 customers left and they seemed extremely lazy to make our orders. I would never recommend this place to anyone. If you are new and are looking for a good boba place I do NOT recommend this spot. I definitely will not be coming here any longer.</Text>

Overall the drinks are great, but the music is ridiculously loud. They can't hear the order, so either you have to get really close or yell (both very annoying) then you can't hear them call the orders... It's a pain, makes me double think my decision to go again.<//review>

The chamango is really good kind of similar to mangoneada. My daughter got a butterfly lemonade with mango Boba, also pictured. And my favorite macaroons are the rose macaroons.<//Review>

Usually a really good place. But today I ordered through the mobile app 2 XL drinks and when I arrived they gave me 2 medium and said they ran out of the cup size I ordered. They did not offer to reimbursement for the difference. I had to ask for a refund on which the employee argued the size he gave me is the same price as my order total. I explained my price was due to the first time mobile 20% off offered through the app. I finally got my refund but lost my 20% offer. Not coming back here again. Management should look into this employee issue his name was Francisco.<//text>

First time trying oit this place. It was packed about 8 people in front of us, we were in and out in less than 15 min. It was very clean. Lots of options, however my smoothie was really watery vs other Boba places I've been to. Overall great experience.</review>

Great Boba spot, with a variety of teas, milk teas, smoothies, and specialty drinks. I've been a boba tea drinker for many years, so I brought a couple first timers with me, to experience it. I purchased for myself the Jasmine Milk Tea with boba, which was so refreshing! One of my friends ordered the Almond milk tea, and they  said it was good but they wished they would've tried a different flavor, outside of there norm.

My other friend raved about their cookies and cream but could've done with out the boba. I always tell people, you either LOVE the boba tapioca or you dont lol. Some flavors go well with boba and some dont. You also have the option of putting flavored jellies in, instead of the tapioca boba. The price is no too bad either. It's a chill spot to just hang out with your friends and chat. Emoji rating=🙂👍🏽🤤🤤🤤</Text>

The place is big, nice and the menu is extensive. But, in a non-rush hour they managed to make THREE OUT OF THREE our drinks wrong. We ordered a hot tea with boba (came without boba at all) and cold one with no sugar and no ice. First time it was with all the sugar and no ice, as they forgot to mark down "no sugar" (that was discussed for 2-3 minutes), and once the kind person was redoing the tea with no sugar, he put lots of ice...
Be careful ;) and very-very-very explicit!</Text>

This is the only place I come to; however, I only come here if I’m willing to wait. It’s looks understaff  because every worker in the back is really working hard but still take 20 - 30 minutes to get my order. As a business it looks like it’s growing, so my point of view is that this can be staffed a little better and by reading  the other reviews I think there’s other customers that could agree but great place good Boba.< /Text>

<review>This place rivals a lot of the boba spots I've been to in the bay area. So far I haven't been disappointed by any of the drinks I've ordered, and the lines and wait times aren't bad at all for what you get. High reccomend this place to any boba lover or newcomer.</review>< user>

Love this place so much!!! There service is great. Awesome customer service. When its crowded its best it sets the mood for the excitement of getting perfect boba. The 3 drinks that i tried was really good. I have a goal of trying the hole menu. Im definately coming back! I hope this help you all. Boba is by far the best and the tapioca balls are sweet non of which i can find inside the mall.<//Text>

The owner is a very rude person, she doesn't understand how to talk to people, she is disrespectful, and the boba drink they made didnt even come out right, if you want good boba go to the Boba Cafe next to Sarah's outlet<//review>

I dont appreciate the hiring a
Manager bullying my friend as he tried to apply there claiming he had false information and even taking jabs at their weight. If thats how the hiring manager views their workers than how do they judge their customers?<//text>

<Review>The wait times are excruciatingly slow, you try to call in a large order KNOWING they are slow workers and they say Sorry, we cant take orders, you cant even pay in advance,  I needed 13 cups which would literally take them forever like 45 minutes to make and they were ALL THE SAME, they refused unfortunately wait time on panel eyes closed or I would have gone there instead I know where my company will go in the future</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Love this place. This was my source for feed, tack, medicinal supply and chew-the-fat place for over 20 yrs, till I retired and moved my mares to the high desert. And they've been there for decades before me. I still visit E Valley when I'm in the SF Valley and need access to a wide array of horse stuff. Top quality goods and kind, knowledgeable service.<//Text>

< Text>
This evening the owner of this feed store showed up at my property  unannounced, and then completely unprovoked  proceeded to verbally assault and berate me, all in front of a minor.
I have been a loyal customer for over TWENTY-FIVE YEARS, and feeding a barn of 12 horses for 25 years I have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars at this store and have sent them many, many customers over the years. I have stuck with them while they dealt with  bouts of moldy and sub standard hay, their consistent lack of continuity in their ability to Stock the store, and delivery drivers with bad attitudes.
I have shown them 25 years of customer loyalty and have always been understanding that sometimes in business we can go through a rough patch.
What happened this evening was a sheer violation of loyalty, trust, and the understanding that I have shown them in the past. The issues that this man has with me, regarding my narrow driveway and the problems that it poses for his drivers, could have easily been rectified through a civil conversation where both parties could have come to a fruitful resolution, or if he no longer wanted my business, he could also have simply let me know in a civil manner, but, for some reason, unbeknownst to me, this man instead chose to violate my space without warning, attack me verbally, while throwing any professionalism, civility, and decency aside to unleash obscenities at me, in front of a minor, and to destroy a 25 year relationship with a customer who would have been happy to find a solution to his delivery issues. I have never been treated so poorly or spoken to so rudely and disrespectfully by someone whose business I have supported so earnestly over the years. The most disheartening part of this is that my order, which was already paid for, and at the property, on the truck, could have easily been left on the street level, literally, they could have just tossed the order from the truck, and I would have been fine with it, but even after telling him, that I needed that hay for tonight's feeding, he let his rage get in the way of compassion for my horses and sent my delivery back to the store.
No matter what his concerns are or were, gave him absolutely no excuse for the way he spoke to me or treated me, and his erratic behaviour was actually frightening, and very unsettling for the minor who had to witness this very upsetting confrontation.
I post this review in hopes that no one else will suffer the abuse that I suffered this evening nor the ramifications of trying to get hay for 12 horses at the last minute on a Friday evening.
If they had not just delivered to me the day before without issue or incident, then I might have been able to try to make some sense of this assault, but alas, i feel that this man lashed out at me for his own pleasure and that is the most disturbing part of all.</Text>

My brother needed some wheat for his meal worms and found this place so we drove over and got some. It was lucky we found this place because he told me the prices are actually cheaper than what he was paying at another feed store (which is actually further from our house). Very friendly and helpful staff, they even let us get some hay for free for the chicken crates. Will definitely return for feed!</review>

They also have game bird feed which was great when I had quail (much higher protein content than chicken feed). I also purchased a brooder and warming lights and chicks previously (there is a quarantine on chickens currently) and they have grown up to be the best and healthiest chickens. Oh. And I forgot to mention my waterer, feeders and chick starter feed in addition to dog food and supplies. They have 50 gallon water tubs that are great for keeping koi and gold 🐟. And tackle and riding gear. They have sales throughout the year so get on their mailing list. My fav feed store!<//review>< Pictures>

Great place, been coming here from Silverlake area to buy chicken feed and chickens for the last 8 years. It is a little slice of country/farm life in LA. Not uncommon to see horses being ridden up and down streets of the historic Stonehurst neighborhood. Staff is always very friendly and helpful.</Review>

MOLDY HAY

I received Moldy Hay from this feed store, and they refused to replace the bale or provide any kind of refund. I purchased 2 bales of three way hay (also called grain Hay) and when I opened the 2nd bale I found to be seriously moldy inside. It was dusty dry green and white mold that was throughout almost all of the bale. The hay had been in storage under 3 weeks and it had not been wet or rainy during that time. This was mold that had happened previously (probably transport or even in the field) and had spread and then dried. The kicker (because accident happen) is that they refused to provide a replacement bale of hay or refund me the purchase price. In 16 years of owning horses I have been sold bad feed exactly 2 times before this, and both stores (in different areas and not the same chain or ownership) immediately provided a replacement no questions asked and apologized profusely. Not this store!  If you want QUALITY Feed that is safe for your horses pick somewhere else!< /Review>

< Review>
I'm so happy to have found Arcata Animal Hospital! Dr. Joy and her staff are the most knowledgeable, thorough, compassionate and professional you will find in Humboldt County. You and your pets are a top priority and it shows at the time of your appointment and the followup calls they make to see how your pet is doing. I will never go anyplace else! I recommend them if you are looking for a caring and professional animal hospital! The Best!<//Review>

This place will take great care of your animal, they have taken great care of my rabbit. It does cost a bit more than some other places but the quality of their services makes it worth every penny. While they do not allow individuals inside at this time, they do a good job of keeping you informed over the phone as to what is going on while your pet is inside the office.< /review>

We came to Arcata Animal Hospital with a rather serious situation involving my Jack Russell terrier. Everyone we met during and after the initial visit was just so helpful and caring. I couldn't have planned better care for my pup during the visit. It's good to know that a quality team is standing by to help with whatever situation there is to confront. Thanks, again, for your care and support.< /text>

The wonderful folks at Arcata Animal Hospital have been caring for our animal family for more than 10 years. Everyone is always responsive and professional. They all love animals and it shows the way they care for all that come through their doors.< /Review>

Doctor Joy is awesome!
She is very gentle and compassionate toward us and our kitty, Bogey.
Our girl tends to be anxious during visits, so Doctor Joy prescribed some meds for her so she would be more relaxed during her exam, and it helped.
The staff have always been so kind and considerate.
I highly recommend this facility!
Thank you, Arcata Animal Hospital!💕🐾</text>

Friendly staff, very knowledgeable and great for emergencies! Thanks for taking care of Lulu so quickly when she had her eye scratched by a cat. We were able to get in within hours and had everything we needed to make sure she healed up right! She is a happy little pup now and her eye is all better. Thanks again!!</review>

< Review>
The Doctors and Staff at the Arcata Animal Hospital are the best at keeping our little guy "Finn" healthy and up to date with all of his vaccines.  They keep us informed with reminders and are very professional and careful with keeping everyone safe, as well as explaining any details with health care maintenance. A very loving and caring practice, just what we need for Sir Finnigan! Thank you!</Review>

< Review>
My gorgeous pug recently passed away at the clinic. He was only 5 so it was absolutely devastating for us to say goodbye knowing we wouldn’t be bringing him home. The staff were very professional didn’t rush our last moments and made everything go flawless. The vet and staff were outstanding and I can honestly fault nothing. Thank you again for all the work you do and the long hours especially staying late so that Tito go a few extra precious minutes with us.< /Review>

<Review>When our timid cat began to have a problem with one eye, we treated her at home for a bit with an ophthalmic vet approved ointment. It didn't get better. I called AAH and they managed to fit her in.( In the world of Covid it can be difficult to get an appointment without paying a huge emergency fee.)  Dr. Joy examined her and sent in a swap for culture/testing. Dr. Joy also called me at home two days later about 5:30 on a Saturday night to see how Patsy was responding. The most difficult thing we've experienced is giving Patsy eye drops 3x daily at home - but we are being successful with the help of a spot of canned cat food after every treatment! I want to thank the AAH for their compassionate and professional care provided our Patsy.<//Review>< user_name>

Very clean coffee and magazine stocked waiting area. Relaxing. Dr Bartlett took time to explain everything in detail. She did not seem rushed although the animal hospital is very busy and well regarded locally. I highly recommend them. I am new to the area and I am so happy I have made an excellent vet connection.</Text>

<username>CBM<//username><Text>I have two issues with this clinic. First, I called and asked if there was an avian specialist at this clinic and was told that there was. Although the vets at this clinic will see exotic pets, I do not believe any of them actually specialize in birds. This may have just been an error of the receptionist (who was otherwise amiable and professional). I brought my budgie in for a check up and received antibiotics for a respiratory issue, but when I asked about further tests that could be done if the antibiotics didn’t work, I was told that doing further tests would be very difficult on smaller bird species. The vet did not seem confident about being able to perform these tests. My budgie is missing half her cere and will likely have chronic health issues relating to this, so I really wanted an actual avian specialist to see her because they have more experience with birds and have dealt with special issues like this. If I had been told that there was not an avian specialist at this clinic I would have taken her to another county. The other clinics who i called in this area were honest about not having an avian specialist at the clinic even if they did see birds.

The second issue was when I got my budgie back. Her first primary feather on her right wing was twisted completely backwards, and her third, brand new primary feather which she just finished growing out on that wing was in the bottom of the cage (along with her older second primary feather). She is molting and only had one new feather on that wing - her other’s were clipped - so it was easy to identify.  I couldn’t go into the clinic while the vet was seeing her due to Covid-19 and was given the wrong dial-in number to watch the examination over the zoom conferencing app (which I downloaded just for this vet visit), so I don’t know how she was handled. I called to ask about this and they suggested that it happened after she left the clinic while she was with me in the car, rather than being accountable for a potential mistake on their part, and I received no apology for how she was returned to me. I was told I could bring her back to the vet, but her wing otherwise seemed okay and I didn’t want to stress her out further by bringing her back to a vet who may have handled her improperly.

So in conclusion, I am pretty disappointed overall by the lack of information about my budgie’s health in general, lack of options for follow-up care if the antibiotics don’t work (which an avian specialist should be able to handle), and lack of care with her handling. I’m sure this clinic is great with cats and dogs but I  would not suggest taking any birds to this clinic.

On my part, I should have done my research first, but now I am going to find a different vet to bring my budgie to for a follow up evaluation after this course of antibiotics. Currently, the closest registered avian vet is Niklos Webler at Whispering Pines Animal Clinic just east of Chico - found through the Association of Avian Veterinarians at aav.org. I hope this review will be helpful for other bird owners in the area who may be naive like I was.

Since it appears that Arcata Animal Hospital routinely responds to these reviews as well, I hope you will be more careful as a practice about telling people that you will see exotic pets (like birds), but not necessarily having a specialist in evaluating that species - unless I am somehow mistaken. The cost of taking a bird to see an avian specialist is about the same as your fee was (on average $70-$90) and I don’t think that is right either.</Text>< Pictures>

I've been taking my sweet kitty here for 8 years, even adopted her from here. We have had amazing care and such kindness in Dr. Bartlett and more recently in Dr Joy and the caring staff with a dental cleaning. Both doctors take the time to explain and listen with understanding whenever we come in. Such genuine people! I have even referred a friend and they welcomed her and her pups even as a new patient.</review>

I was so incredibly impressed with the Arcata Animal Hospital. They were able to see my dog just 40mins after I called them. They were so accommodating, professional and affordable. They went over all of the treatment options and prices and did not pressure us at all. We absolutely loved our experience with them and would highly recommend them to anyone.< /text>

< Review>
They are great with your pets. It looks like they really care when you are there. They are not so good on your bank account. They recommended sooooo many medications and supplements and when I went home and looked the same exact prescriptions up online they were double the amount. I realize they have to make money somehow but I’m a single mother and I felt guilt tripped into buying the meds even though I explained I couldn’t afford them. I recently called to see if they would send a prescription for revolution flea meds to an online company so I could get a cheaper rate. They said I would need to bring the cats in for a check up even though they are not in need of one. I pleaded with them to help me out bc my cat is suffering and I can’t afford an office visit. They said they couldn’t help me out. I will no longer be support this clinic and am on the hunt for a vet who understands economic state we are all living in these days.<//Review>

<user_name>Em Bill</user_name><text>These folks are awesome. You can really tell they love animals; they are kind and enthusiastic toward every pet that comes through the door. The quality of care is the best I've seen any of the places I've taken my dog. All of the staff, not just the vets and assistants, are very knowledgeable about the different services, procedures, and products so you can figure out what's best for you and your pet. Even though she goes in for shots and nail trims, Ginger LOVES this vet. She gets excited as soon as we come in the parking lot - and if that's not a gold star of approval I don't know what is!<//text><Rating>5</Rating><Pics>None</Pics></record>

The vet and staff were espe vertigo ally kind and helpful. I was short on money and they didn't do anything superfluous. They told me how to care for my pup's wound at home to reduce further costs. I will be back here next time I need irregular care.</Review>

< Review>
Out of all the vet places I've been in Humboldt, they are definitely the best. They are timely, nice, and very clear. They have fair prices and are honest. I would definitely reccomend them. They are located off Guintoli closer to the 299 freeway rather than the 101.</Review>

<Text>I am torn... I had to put my dog to sleep, so I called around and was quoted X amount with creamation service, I immediately made the appointment and made arrangements for my dad to pay... our appointment was prompt even tho it was a holiday and doctor joy and her staff were great and respectful HOWEVER.... when we were “ready” we waited over an hour and the WORST part was I was told the WRONG PRICE!!! It was $350.00 MORE!!! What?!?! I had no choice but to spend part of my tight budget on the services or take home my dead companion?? When I was quoted one price then told another was egregious especially cuz I was distraught and tried to make all the arrangements beforehand so I didn’t have this exact problem... really sucked... they blamed it on a new hire... lame...< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< gmap_id>

<review>They say your animal needs intensive care or an operation only to get money from you two times i took my dog there the first time all i needed to give her was calcium (tums) and wouldnt tel me untill i insisted three hundred was all i had. This last week they said she needed surgery for obstructive bowel while the whole time was going poop she was intoxified by gasoline. I paid another 300.00 but they were wanting 1.500.00 they dont know what the hell their talking about but their real good about talking about putting your dog to sleep if i would have played in to their game my dog would be dead right now because of their inprofesionalism.<//review>< name>

<Text>There is a variety is there for American, Mexican,  and seafood.  Should be a good one stop visit for travelers. Good location in the middle of town. Many television sets and tables makes this a good spot for watching sports and group events. There was a tasty funnel cake dessert here too. There are a couple of crane  games for kids.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Customer service was good, the tables were clean, and we got our food in a reasonable amount of time. It was exceptionally dark inside though, and the bathroom wasn't very clean. The wings tasted strange, and the fries were cold. The garlic fries that my girlfriend and I ordered had hardly any garlic.<//text>

<Time>1532975324586</Time><Rating>3</Rating><text>It's a good place if you want to watch sports and have beer and a quick bite to eat. The downside that I don't like about Shooters is they don't have a separate pan to make french fries and onion rings and anything that goes in the deep fryer that isn't attached to what they use for any type of fish so if you're allergic to fish don't get anything that's deep fried like french fries onion rings chicken strips Etc. It's very dangerous if you don't know and it wouldn't put them out to have a separate deep frying station that they don't use any fish products in.< /text>< Pics>

Had these been dryer, I assume they would have tasted amazing. Customer service was outstanding. Except I asked for ranch and got a huge surprise when it was blue cheese. 😐Mainly the reason I rated 3 stars. Would recommend this place to fellow people. Order a sandwich or burger, stay away from the wings.<//review><Date>1537749339323<//Date><Resp>None< /Resp>< pics>

<Review>My expectations of what this place was was busted as soon as I walked in. Patterson doesn't have a lot to offer for a happy hour grill and this place was a big let down. As soon as I walked I felt like this place wasn't even going to rise to the level of a Chili's and it wasn't even close. I went safe with a burger and tater tots, dump their burger. Meet was overcooked and boring. Tots came from a frozen bag, okay I get it, but at least make sure they are cooked through some where not. The servers were all nice and they made my order right after another attempt. Drive another 20 minutes to Tracy and look for another grill any other grill.</Review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

The food is good and it's a hangout for locals.  Everyone is friendly and seems to know each other.  My kind of place.</Review>

I'm guessing you gotta be a bit buzzed or just come for the alcohol, honestly the food is pretty bad. Not much seasoning and the fries are obviously microwaved, because they were cold and not fried at all. I guess if you like beer ok, otherwise go somewhere else</text>

I live in Patterson, I took my father-in-law to dinner to try out this restaurant for the 1st time.  We sat outside along with a couple of other customers and we made our order and also notice that the other customers around us were having issues with their order. When the food arrived it was only my father-in-law's food and as he politely waited for my food to arrive I told him to eat his food. When my tri-tip sandwich arrived, I noticed 4 thin slices of meat on the sandwich and the rest was lettuce, along with cold fries. I told the waitress and she took it to fix it. By the time it was returned to me my father in law finished his dinner and my sandwich had a few more pieces of meat on it. Plus it did not feel like it was fresh, more like placed in the microwave. As I got a box, my father in law paid the bill. I couldn't let him pay for the worst tri-tip sandwich I've ever had. So I asked for a refund for my meal that I did not eat. They did offer me another sandwich, but I declined their offer since they already had the chance to fix it.
I gave this place a 2nd & 3rd try after that experience, and still was not impressed with their overpriced food, which was not that great. I will not go back there again.
I would rather go to Apricot's BBQ in Patterson and pay a little more.</review>

Great Cheesesteaks! Good service. Lots of big TV's for sports. If you get a Cheesesteak, they do have excellent marinara sauce if you want to make it a Philly.< /Text>

Been here twice now. Came the first time cause I was craving wings and my daughter got a burger. I got boneless wings and they were excellent, but holy **** I had a couple bites of my daughter's burger, and it was outrageously good! Next time I came with both kids and I got the mushroom swiss burger, which was also outstanding. The wings are great, there's absolutely nothing wrong with them, but the burgers are sooooo juicy and delicious, it's going to be a struggle to order every time lol. The service has been nothing short of excellent as well. Very happy with Shooters!<//Review>

<text>Had the opportunity to experience Shooters Wings & Things today for lunch and was enjoyed it.  What struck me most was they had a "Veggie Melt" sandwich...but then again...this is California...so...maybe it shouldn't have surprised me.  Regardless...I had the Veggie Melt sandwich and it was loaded w/ Avocado - num num!!  The only downside was..they only offered White bread (as Johnny Cockran would say - "If it's white it's ain't right.") or Rye bread (which is a form of white bread).

So...I would recommend Shooters.</text>< user>

Crossroads did an amazing job for me tonight. At the time of an absolute emergency, they went above and beyond for my pet. Their prices for an ER visit were higher than I expected, but all records were transferred on for me without even asking. I really feel like everyone cared and was doing everything they could tonight. Thank you all very much.</review>

<time>1615148423283< /time><text>Many years ago i brought my cat here. The doctor was very nice and took his time examining her. Today was a completely different experience. Another vet saw her and pretty much sounded like her and her staff aren't good at handling older cats that are  stressed at the vet's office. She pretty much suggested other ER clinics and other vets. Said to examine her she would have to sedate her but seemed to be pushing me away to other places. Their confidence in their experience seems lacking. I've never had a vet encourage me to take my cat somewhere else. So weird. Don't come here if you have a true emergency and your pet is stressed. They don't know how to handle that. So for $100 consultation fee I was encourage to go somewhere else. Wish I had that money back to put it towards a vet that could handle examining a stressed kitty.</text>< user_id>

I’ve brought my pup here 4 times (from swallowing foreign objects to kennel cough) and every single time the staff has been diligent and kind. I agree it can be rather expensive, but it’s an emergency room so you get what you pay for. Each and every time after they have evaluated my pup they have called me to give me options on what to do next - in my experience, they have never pressured me to choose the option that is more costly. In fact they have done the opposite, and have told me that certain procedures weren’t necessary which is why I believe they truly have your pet’s best interest at heart. They work odd hours and deal with many patients so the wait can be long, but I take comfort in the fact that if my puppy’s life was on the line they would take her in immediately and do everything in their power to save her (as I’ve seen them do in the past). Ultimately do what is right for you and your budget, but based on competency and care by the staff, I wholeheartedly recommend Crossroads.< /review>

<review>Friendly and helpful. Price is reasonable for an emergency clinic. People in here are just giving bad reviews because they complain about the price. Animal hospital meds and equipment are just as expensive as in human hospitals, people. STOP expecting Animal hospitals to be cheap or free, or don't you value your pet as much as a family member? If you go to a "cheap" place you should be concerned on what they actually do. And remember that this is an emergency hospital,  if it's for a check up I suggest you go to your pet's vet.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

I'm so disappointed in this animal hospital the worst experience ever I took my dog because she was in labor and having complications and I was told to wait out in the parking lot for 8 hours or more and I was so  upset and sick to my stomach to watch my poor baby suffer and yet they still wanted to charge me a fee and they did nothing to her so I left and took her to a different vet. I don't recommend this place to no one at all this place needs to be shut down. We go to you for help and you guys give us no hope what so ever.<//Text>

<Text>To put my review in context, I must relate that in 2020 I dealt and am still dealing with doctors on an almost daily basis. Also, have been dealing with wonderful veterinarians at Washington Blvd Animal Hospital for 50 years. Thus, I have ample experiences to use as comparison with my 3/1-3/2/2021 interactions with Dr. Ortega. In 2020,  my daughter”s almost new car was stolen and then stolen from the first two thieves by another thief and was a total loss. Same.day daughter’s son, a lineman, fell from high steel electrical towers to be rescued by helicopter. Daughter then had open heart surgery and while she was in hospital, I had emergency surgery and spent ten days in hospital. Next daughter’s husband died on a Monday and on Saturday of same week daughter’s second open heart surgery left her in vegetative state. They fed fifty feral cats daily which friend and I are now doing. I am 73. Crossroads refused to let friend take very sick cat in for me and pay with my Care Credit card. My daughter is having a procedure today and I
needed to be rested. I offered to come sign for charges when visit complete. Nothing could be worked out and I had to sit in my car in the cold for four hours. Dr. Ortega never said one kind word with respect to my daughter’s condition (who has taken a cat there and spent a bundle.) Nor did she have an ounce of compassion for me. She wanted $900 to do blood and urine work and full body X-rays. I have never in 50 years had a veterinarian want to start out with both a blood panel and X-rays. A blood panel normally tells a lot about organs. I did the blood and urine tests and not the X-rays. Dr. Ortega told me the results but said without the X-rays she didn’t know the cause. I asked her to estimate the cat”s age which she said she couldn’t do. I know the rescued feral cat was at least 14 years olds and not having thousands to spend on X-rays, more tests, a blood transfusion and who knows what else, sobbing I made the decision to euthanize the sweet cat. I will never know what was really wrong with Butch because I would not trust one word out of Dr. Ortega’s mouth. I expect to pay a fair price for honest and compassionate veterinarian services. I would bet the equity in my house that Dr. Ortega’s number one motivation is MONEY! She appeared to be a cold, heartless individual who was incredibly rude and unreasonable. If money isn’t her primary motivation, she needs to learn some people skills. In all fairness, the staff was both kind and competent.<//Text>< name>

They saved my boys life, and they were friendly. The vet was also empathetic towards my situation. Yes these emergency situations can be costly but if you love your pet it is worth every penny. Thanks crossroads for taking in my boy.<//Text>

I'm so disappointed in this animal hospital the worst experience ever I took my dog because she was in labor and having complications and I was told to wait out in the parking lot for 8 hours or more and I was so  upset and sick to my stomach to watch my poor baby suffer and yet they still wanted to charge me a fee and they did nothing to her so I left and took her to a different vet. I don't recommend this place to no one at all this place needs to be shut down. We go to you for help and you guys give us no hope what so ever.< /Text>

Absolutely worst place you can take ur loved animal. All the staff are incredibly rude. While my dog was in critical condition all they cared about was the $100 up front. Gave me at least a 1 hour lecture and screamed at me and my grieving fiancé. No respect for the owners of the animal. Doctor Ortega said it’s “her job” to yell at us, but I thought her job was TO CARE FOR MY DOG! Was told they can not print out a receipt has to be through email. They never sent the email til I had to call and bug them.</Text>

Do NOT take your pet here... I know some of us do things out of desperation because their hours are SO convenient but they’re just there to take advantage of your pets situation and charge you as much as possible. I took my cat around 8pm a few days ago, was told they’re were at capacity and wait times were 3-4hrs. We got there and the parking lot had no more than 3 cars. We ended up waiting the full 4hrs, they finally called me to bring him to the side past midnight and took him. They called after an hour or so to tell me they had to do xrays, blood work, full exam and I was looking at about $,1,250 but they would deduct the $95 I paid when I checked him in just so we could stay in line. I agreed to only find out later, xrays weren’t needed since the originali reason I took him in had nothing to do with the possibility if him having any broken bones or accident of any kind. They then called me around 4am to tell me treatment would cost me around $350. This would be fluids, antibiotics, probiotics and that’s it. I didn’t know any better and agreed. Total ended costing me almost $1,600 for NOTHING. They told me they would have his lab work in 3 days, never happened. I kept calling day 3, 4, 5 (always promising me a call back and results not being available) and today I told them I would not get off of the phone until I spoke with someone since NOW it’s been a full week since I took my cat there and he hasn’t ate anything since. I told them I’m not sure how he hasn’t passed away! They told me I should bring him in and hospitalize right away, I said no way, you guys already charged me $1,600 for what? No results. No diagnosis and want me to spend another $400 a night?!?! The guy told me I was looking at more like a minimum of $1,000 a night and that without treatment smh... I told them the only reason I took him there in the first place is because it’s damn near imposible for me to take him to a vet during the day because of my work hours and reason I had no choice but to take him to a hospital after hours. My kitty was bleeding from his rectum for a whole week before I decided to take him. I initially thought it was constipation because I read that’s very common and he’s an older cat but after he left that hospital, it was literally water/blood coming out if him for 3 days until he hasn’t gone anymore but then again he’s not eating, super sad, has tears in his eyes and can’t wait for Saturday to get here soon enough since his vet is open for a few hours during the day and my day off. Please pray for my cat guys, I’m trying to feed him pedialite, vitamins and he won’t let me give it to him in the baby syringe anymore. He also stopped drinking water and refuses to let us give him antibiotics anymore. By the way, around 11:30pm that night, a white Mercedes drove in crazy speeds, pulled in all the way past the gate meaning he worked there so I called again for an update to see where we were in line since we had been there since a little before 8pm. The nurse said doctor had just gotten back from lunch and things should start moving along faster. The truth is that doctor wasn’t there and didn’t arrive till almost midnight when they’re suppose to be open at 6pm and told me and others I’m sure they were at max capacity and reason waiting hours were 3-4hrs smh. They are liars and crooks taking advantage of peoples situations and their pets since they know for many, pets are family and many cases like peoples babies/kids.<//text>

<Text>Horrible. I took my sick cat in yesterday at The Crossroads. I called them in tears because I thought he wasn't going to make it.
I paid $95.00 for them to babysit him and stick a thermometer in my cat.
They call you from the parking lot as you wait for them to do the "physical" exam. 30min go by and they call you also depending on the many dogs and cats they see that night..
In order for my cat to "feel better" (their words exactly) it would be $2,000+ dollars for their services of x rays, blood work, medicine, ect. If you can't afford it, they will offer you a payment plan to pay for the  outstanding bill. If you tell them no thanks I'll take him to a more affordable hospital; They will get passive aggressive towards you.
They will have you sign dispatch papers  stating negative false statements on possible cruelty and abusive behavior to my animal and his surroundings for declining treatment offered from them. I refused to sign because I felt as my honest human right I don't have to sign and agree with any of their nagative statements accusations towards me and my pet. I know how I am with my pet and that's final.
They re-wrote the documents and have you SIGN. In order to receive your fur baby back you will need to SIGN guys, pay attention, AND if you call the sheriff's station  they can't do anything for you.
The parking lot is another story.. as you're waiting in their parking lot you see other random cars of who knows also waiting to be called as well. The lights will turn off for a couple minutes and it can be a little freaky like something feels a little off.
I don't know but I wouldn't want anyone to go through this experience that I went through last night. When your fur baby is in someone else's hands and you cant save him. Not good so I felt I needed to write this.</Text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

I was in need of a vet at 3am. My fury baby was vomiting blood. Dr Claire Ortega took very good care of my dog. She was diagnosed with pancreatic.  Blood work was done & ultrasound I did not hesitate to do all that was recommended by the dr. Claire Ortega. Dr Ortega & the staff go beyond the call of duty with their professional great hospital. Yes. Their price are a little higher but you get what you pay for. They have new equipment  and a lab which means your get results quick. Thank you again for taking excellent care of my fury baby.<//text>

I should’ve listened to the other reviews. If your pet doesn’t 100% require immediate attention at an odd hour of the day, go elsewhere. I came here because I was worried about my dog and was charged $95 for a consultation, $300 for bloodwork, and $300 for x-rays only to be told that they can’t tell me exactly what’s wrong with my dog. I was told we should just move forward with surgery for another $3500. And if you leave to think about it, you have to pay the $95 fee again. I went somewhere else with a free consultation fee and much more reasonable prices.< /text>

Horrible! I am so disappointed in their services.  They charge you $95 before yourndog is admitted in the facility. You wait and theybtell you that you neednto do the whole works, xray, blood work and anything to help their bill increase. We said no, and then she said let me call you back. Called us back to negotiate a different solution. Half the cost. Now it wasnt about the money but the way they go about business.

Went to local vet next day, under 300 conpared to thousands. BEWARE!</text>

<Review>If I could give this place a minus 0 I would!!! During A time of this pandemic,  we,  animal parents, are face to see anyone who could help us bring health to our beloved furry family members when they are sick. First let me say that the staff itself is polite and pleasant when you call to make appointment and when you speak to the technician over anything but the less classy vet Claire Ortega leaves a lot to say about her professionalism! When you are faced with the fact that you brought your dog in for something that you “hoped”could be treated and this doctor tells you she is going to die if she doesn’t get the treatment vet is advising... it you take your pet home. When you question if there are options??? This woman is really something. All I could say is To never never never take your pet here. It is true! They ask for a credit card before they see your pet! And they charge you the $95 whooping fee! This place is not about your baby! ti’s about this placing making money! I wish I would have read reviews but I was referred by another vet that were full. Unfortunately my dog is really sick and it seemed she came out worse than what she went in.

Don’t want to make this supper long but please don’t go to this place and if you think I am lying... research Clair Ortega and you will see who this monster of a vet is. This whole COVID has made things hard but this person Clair Ortega makes things a whole lot worse! Stay away.

took my puppy there(emergency) after a 3,000.00 vet bill from crossroads (my vet was closed) then took her to our regular vet who sent her to specialist and another 6,000.00 dollar surgery because Crossroads did not fix her leg properly in the first place it led to bigger problems. I do not recommend ! 000000stars  .</text>

<review>I never write reviews but felt compelled to after the service I received here. I took my fur baby Luna here after she had an allergic reaction and her eyes/lips were very swollen. Because of covid-19, I was not allowed inside which was completely understandable. Over the phone, I gave them a brief description & paid the $95 exam fee. The vet tech met me at a side door and I handed my dog over. I was beyond nervous so I’m so grateful that I received two calls from them within 30 minutes updating me and letting me know how she was doing and what the doctor recommended (fluids, blood work, steroid injection, benadryl injection, eye flush, Benadryl tablets to take home, & an antihistamine).  I agreed to everything and was told the price would be $355. So my final total for the exam fee and treatment was $450. I was beyond relieved to hear this price as I was picturing something much higher. Once they were done the doctors assistant came out and gave me some discharge instructions, along with the medication and some complimentary Just for Dogs dog food (which my dog loved and I will most likely be switching her to)...

I was such an emotional wreck as she’s never been sick before but every single person I spoke to (the receptionist, vet tech & doctors assistant) was so kind and seemed genuinely happy to help. I couldn’t have asked for a better experience. If anyone at Crossroads is reading this, I’m beyond thankful. Sending so much love to every single one of you who helped my Luna today.</review><rate>5< /rate>< pics>

This place only wants to make money out of your pet.   They are trained like car salesman.   They seem to get a commission from the charges.  That night, there were only two dogs that they were treating, with a staff of 5 people, they would lose money that night therefore they treated my dog like it’s money making time.    They recommend this cost and that cost like a appliance salesman getting a commission.      Of course I was desperate and agreed to all.   They seemed to be pleased that they are making the sales.  They over treated my dog , shocked her and she died.  Absolutely over treated her, sent her into shock.   May be the treatment was needed but it’s their salesman ship that made me sick to the stomach.  Even upon her death, they wanted to sell me casket or cremation for more money.   This place may look clean but under the cover are commissioned sales person.   It just seems they care more about their income or their commission.</Review>

This is the second time I've had to take my kenai to this hospital, and both times they been amazing to my baby, I wish I could explain how grateful I am with everyone there, they all knew Kenai very well, called me to check up on her, I can honestly say that everyone from the receptionist, to billing, to nurses, and specially Dr. Camuso, were exceptional!!! Again Thank you from the bottom of my heart!!!<//Text>

If I could give 0 stars I would. This place is so terrible. They required a 700 fee before even checking my puppy of 5 months. They knew I was so worried because she was having seizures and told me they were doing tests and I refused to hospitalize her over night because they wanted to charge me 2,000 so they asked me how much more money I was willing to spend. I said no more than 500 apart from the 700 because obviously I wanted my puppy to be good and wanted to know what was going on. I ended up spending 1,200 for them to just tell me NOTHING. They were not helpful at all. They didn’t know what to even tell me they just wanted more money. I went to my local vet few days after and showed them the paperwork of what they did and even my puppy’s vet said that was RIDICULOUS. They refused to give her any meds that would help the seizures but luckily my puppy’s vet gave her an injection that they should’ve gave her at this place. I only took her here because my local vet was closed. This place is horrible and robs your money. Plain and simple!< /Text>

REFUSE SERVICES IF YOU SEE WENDY BUCKLE. This is by far the worst animal emergency hospital we have gone to. We had the unfortunate idea to come here since it was closer to us and our dog was vomiting clear liquid. THE VET (WENDY BUCKLE) PLAYS WITH YOUR EMOTIONS, do not fall for this. She'll tell you "you came in a right time" and makes the situation of your dog worse than it is and overcharges you. Not only did we decline the 2,000+ charge we notified them if he can at least get the injection for his infection which she refused to do so. After we stated we wanted our dog back she kept insisting that we wanted our dog to die and there's 95% chance our dog will die in the morning. She also told us she was going to call animal control and that they were going to knock on our door and fine us for animal negligence. YES SHE TOLD US THIS JUST BECAUSE WE REFUSED THE SERVICES AND WANTED TO GO SOMEWHERE ELSE FOR HIS TREATMENT. We went to another animal hospital that night and thank god we asked for the $500 copies of his results as well as his x-rays at Crossroads Animal Hospital. The other doctor reviewed his results and told us he isn't in critical condition and welcomed my pup in the morning (No, our dog was nowhere near death like she said he was). IF YOU SEE WENDY BUCKLE YOU SHOULD RUN.</text>

I had an excellent experience with this pet hospital. My dog, a four pound chi, swallowed a small bone fragment that lodged in his throat. He was unable to swallow it or to cough it up.I thought he was going to die. He was having trouble breathing.  The doctor at the facility had never performed a surgery  removing a bone, on this particular area, but he said he would try to save my dog's life. Usually the bone will travel into the stomach and cannot go through the bowel or intestine. Anyway, the doctor was able to surgically remove the bone, (at time of surgery it was just above the heart).  It was quite risky. But the doctor took such great care and the surgery was successful. I love my dog and will never allow him to have any type of bone again.  Thanks to the doctor, I am given more time to love and care for my dog.I cannot say enough, except I did put my dog's life in the doctor's hands and it was the best thing to do. So you can take my word that this is a good place to entrust your pet to.</Text>

< review>
DO NOT BRING YOUR PETS HERE IF YOU CAN HELP IT.

This was an AWFUL experience.
I brought my 2 year old dachshund in here due to a urinary blockage. Xilo was in desperate need of help.

FIRST RED FLAG: They take your pet away from you right away. My little guy was obviously in a lot of pain, and he is often nervous and fearful around new people. I don't understand why we aren't allowed to see our pet after he gets checked in.

SECOND RED FLAG: The woman who came out to take him didn't have a chart, didn't even have a piece of paper! SHE WAS WRITING THE INFO WE GAVE HER ON HER GLOVE.
I should have walked out then, but I was too worried about my Xilo.

THIRD RED FLAG: My dog was THE ONLY ANIMAL GETTING CHECKED IN. The workers REPEATEDLY asked me his name. OVER & OVER & OVER. I was obviously very emotional & upset. Maybe it's asking a lot, but they could have at least PRETENDED to care about my baby by peeking at his paperwork. But then again, maybe they threw away that info glove right???

FOURTH RED FLAG: When they finally call us to the back we're escorted to this weird empty room, with 2 chairs, but my dog is still no where to be seen. Dr. Buckle walks in and tells us in the most insincere tone how "they'll take care of our baby" then an assistant walks in to explain the coming bill.

FIFTH (It Keeps Going!): Said assistant walks in, and begins talking to us in a hushed dramatic tone, like he's pretty much whispering at us how the Dr. needs $670 worth of tests JUST to diagnose my dog. He tries to convince us we need ALL of those tests to make sure we know what's going on. We could not afford to pay that much and still get him treated. All of a sudden he goes to talk to the Dr. about how they could bring down the price. This goes on 3-4 times.

Are we in a negotiation??? WE ARE VERY UNCOMFORTABLE BECAUSE THEY ARE CLEARLY ONLY TRYING TO SEE HOW MUCH WE'RE WILLING TO SPEND.

SIXTH RED FLAG: When we tell whisper guy WE CAN NOT afford even the lowest option ($355) he sends in the vet. We tell her we'd rather check Xilo out and try to get a second opinion. We want to save him, not spend our already small budget on one X-ray. THATS WHEN THE EXTREME SHAMING, AND SCARE TACTICS BEGIN.

She tells us that if we take Xilo "without treatment" she will have to report us to animal control under California law. Because We were "informed he could be suffering".
Then she goes on and on explaining how his bladder could rupture if it was a kidney stone causing the blockage and he needs to be diagnosed.
Ummm OKAY. Who's the worse person? Me, because I can't afford your price gouging, or YOU Dr. Buckle, who have access to everything needed to diagnose/save him, but refuse because I can't pay you up front!!!

Then she tried to convince me I should put my dog down if we couldnt afford to diagnose him. Just like that. From 1 hour to the next I was supposed to give up on his life and kill him. Without even knowing what was going on.

They were 100% preying on our fear, worry, and love for our pet. It was clearly a mind game from the very start.
We told her she could do what she wanted and call whoever she needed to call. We were taking him out of that place.

We left there with a $130 bill for the exam and one pain injection. We have no way of knowing that he even actually GOT the shot, and we weren't consulted about it either. Apparently another "CA law".

Obviously we didn't mind paying for that, he definitely needed it, I just wish I had actually SEEN it happen. But the exam was a total waste of money. They told me nothing of value.

This Place couldn't even be bothered to take ACCURATE NOTES from his visit. Attached in images you'll find the paperwork we received. 9/10/18??????
& XILO DIDN'T RECIEVE ANY MEDICATION???
Again, at least PRETEND to care.

My Xilo made it through the night, and was seen by the wonderful people at Bellflower Pet Hospital who worked with us instead of focusing on money. He had emergency surgery with them the next day.

I understand an ER is an ER. But if I were you, I'd try a different one for your pet.</review>

Our precious labrador retriever threw up a lot of blood onto our kitchen floor late one weekend evening and it was a very scary.  We rushed her to Crossroads Animal Emergency and they were very nice and took her in quickly and the doctor examined her and later explained everything in detail.  We were assured she would be fine.  They let us go back and see her in their lab which was clean and large.  We were very appreciative of the care they took of her.<//Review>

Was unhappy and felt they were  dishonestt when evaluating my dog. The counselor said they needed multiple tests before even treating my dog and the cost would be 1140.oo ( before treating him).  I felt that they are taking advantage of people at there low point worried about there loving pets.< /review>

I had a wonderful experience at Crossroads.  I was scrambling at the last second to find a good emergency vet for my dog that was suffering from bloat.  I needed to find the most cost effective pet hospital and I think Crossroads was the best.  They were honest about all possible outcomes for my pet and how that translated into dollars.  They were very friendly, very knowledgeable and had great communication.  I think I made the best choice for my pet and would not hesitate to refer Crossroads to anyone.  It was worth the drive.  Thank you Crossroads!!!!!</Text>

I took in a 3 day old pup that I was putting on the mom ever two hours to eat, at 2 am the pup eat at 4am wasn’t responding well and was weak and I’m not sure if the mom milk was coming in yet and I don’t no how to tube feed, I went in after 6 am I told them I didn’t want to run any test if they could feed the pup they told me no by this time it was 7:30am the pup didn’t eat all this time and was so weak it died. On the paper work they sent me it Says to feed the pup every 2 to 3 hours and it has the timeline showing the pup didn’t eat in 5 1/2 hours I’m going to report them to the Better Business Bureau so they can review this doctor.<//text>

I've never done a review before - but I had to this time. I was so disappointed.  This was the closest ER i could take my dog who had a sudden allergic reaction - it was bad his eyes were swollen and his muzzle and he was covered in hives. They took my dog in immediately and soon after a vet came in and said what i already knew - he had an allergic reaction - he had had hives before but  nothing this severe involving a swollen face. She told me I did the right thing by bringing him in because his throat was starting to close. Typically, in the past, they would give him one shot of benadryl & another of a steroid. ( At other ER'S )I've walked out the door with about $200-250 tab including the visit fee. Not only did this vet make me panic that my dogs airways were closing but they came in with these quotations for two shots along with blood work and blah blah. Telling me I had to pay $707 dollars to help him! I didn't have this money - it put me in to a complete panic. I didn't understand if that flat fee was $75 - how could this be an additional 600+ dollars. After a few minutes of crying and panic - a nurse came in with a reduction of a little over $400 and a payment plan ( which was nice ) but, still way over my budget - and they made it sound like they were removing some of the treatments to lower the price and if anything happened to my dog it was my fault for not agreeing to the $700. Meanwhile, my dog is still struggling. I agreed to the plan to pay over $400 with a payment plan.

The next morning his eyes were still swollen shut and hives were coming back. I took him to a primary care vet. THIS is where it gets bad. They gave him the same two shots plus an additional long lasting allergy shot... i walked out with a bill of $105 including the visitation. I showed them the  bill and told him what I was quoted at the ER - no one could believe it. Ripped off completely. I don't recommend this place. Definitely not as compassionate towards the pets / owners as other places I've been to.

Please don't take advantage of people - Our pets mean so much.<//Text>

I was so pleased how my pet was taken care of. they took gentle care of her and really took time out to explain her procedure and care after surgery. we even had a follow up call to see how our girl was doing and were told if we had any other questions to feel free to call. I would definitely go back if my pets needed attention< /Review>

My little terrier was attacked in our backyard by a coyote at 2 in the morning. I rushed her to Crossroads where staff acted immediately to diagnose her injuries and calm my nerves. They were frank but gentle with their assessment and prognosis and clearly explained their plan of treatment. They were businesslike and understanding as to costs and financing. Their quick actions and expertise saved my dog’s life. When they discharged my pup to the care of our regular vet, they had already called my vet to explain the injuries and treatment and transmitted all her records. They made sure I had a copy of the records as well as a DVD with all xrays and scans. I feel very fortunate to have such talented and caring professionals so close by. Thank you Crossroads for saving my pup’s life.<//review>

<text>It was a Saturday on a holiday weekend and my Vet would not be open until that Monday. My dog went in to Crossroads Animal Emergency with flu symptoms. A cough that was causing difficulty breathing. Instead of starting off with the simplest and least expensive of conducting a blood test for her. They scared me by saying something could be wrong with her heart and lungs. They came at me with a cost of 800 for all the test. I was alone, they knew I was worried about my dog and fed off my fear to make as much money off of me. I told them I couldn’t afford that so they took out one unnecessary test at gave me a revised cost of 600. I asked if they can just do a blood test because I am positive she has flu symptoms or a common cold. I want her cough taken care of. They told me something can be wrong with her heart and I should have all these tests done because something could happen over the long weekend. Frustrated, tired and worried I ended up having to pay 580 and when the tests came back, my dog had a bacterial infection so antibiotics were prescribed. That’s it, her heart and lungs were fine. Which I had already told them, she had no history of problems. They are a rip off and out to take as much money from their patients. They know, if we take our pets to an emergency at odd hours then we will be willing to pay anything. I feel like they robbed me and took my kindness and love for my dog for granted. Horrible! Horrible! Avoid going to this business!<//text><UserId.>104965448978035137631</UserId.>< Pics>

<time>1559275152666<//time><Text>I took my cat Millie in to see our regular vet to treat a large abscess on her side. She had surgery with a huge incision closed with sutures. Unfortunately, the vet didn't leave a drain for any recurring infection to come out on it's own. Millie developed an abscess with pus coming out around the sutures. We took her to Crossroads, and Dr Thomas Camuso opened the wound and cleaned it out, and left a drain at the site.  It was a bad infection and the incision was in the worst spot. Every time Millie moved her leg forward, it put pressure on the stitches. We had to take her back in to get the wound debrided. Dr Thomas fixed it up and put staples.  We took Millie back to get the staples removed and all seemed well, but due to the location of the original incision, the wound opened back up.  Back we go to see Dr Thomas! This time he closed the wound with dissolving sutures and that did the trick. I'm so thankful for his persistance, knowledge, and skill.  It has been several months, and Millie is doing great.  Dr Thomas saved her life and for that, we  are so grateful. Thank you so much.<//Text><user_id>105692217042145120252</user_id>< Gmap_id>

Great service! My cat was recently diagnosed with diabetes and her blood sugar dropped pretty low; I gave her honey and took her in to be checked out. The staff was very helpful, and the doctor and assistant did a great job at explaining the process of what would be done. When everything was done, they both went over the results and recommended to reduce the cat's insulin dosage and to follow up with the primary vet in a few weeks. In the end, the price wasn't as high as I thought it would be; I paid around $250 for the examination, blood work, fluids (the electrolytes were a little low, so fluids were given to raise electrolytes levels) and appetite stimulant medication (the cat wasn't eating well). It is a little expensive for what was done, but it was a medical emergency and the cat's primary vet was closed, but like I mentioned earlier, great service and great staff. One last thing, they do have coffee, teas and snacks in the lobby.

Update: The vet is caring because the following evening, they called to check up on my cat to see how she was doing and answered a few of my questions. They even called my cat's primary vet to give them an update on the emergency visit because the primary vet called me (and told me that Crossroads had called him) the following day to get an update on my cat as well. Great communication!<//text>

<text>I was so grateful that Crossroads was open on Thanksgiving night. I brought my 3 year old choco lab in because his tail was bleeding like crazy from excitement. The staff was kind, understanding, and so helpful considering my pup is large and he was spewing blood left and right. The care of both my pup and me was excellent. I wish they weren't as expensive as they are but I'm forever grateful for their great care and customer service.< /text>< pics>

Sadly I had to take my old guy, Gerry, for his final visit.  The staff was sensitive and kind.  Their empathy and patience was above and beyond.  I spoke with the doctor about alternatives to putting Gerry to sleep and we discussed and explored all options and what would ultimately be best for my little buddy.  In the end, euthanizing Gerry was the only real alternative.  Even in that difficult moment, everyone at Crossroads became a friend and family member showing such kindness and goodness to my pup.  Thanks Crossroads.  You're always there when I need you and your people are the best.</Text>

I can't thank Dr. Rafail & the whole team who helped my Kobe have a chance at recovering after being hit by 2 cars. If it weren't for their miracle work to move forward & help us, I highly doubt my puppy would've still been here w/ us! The staff was very professional, so kind, & helpful. Highly recommend this place, they're good service but even better people who want nothing but the best for your pets.</review>

<review>What is an Emergency? What is your time worth? Go here only if it’s dire. I bet they could of saved my dog. But I didn’t go there after they overcharged me the first time I was there for my cat. It wasn’t even worth it though. Air and a bandaid 300$ But really if you need like an emergency surgery they can probably do it.<//review>< Pics>

On a late Sunday afternoon my Maltese, Dolly became very sick and basically could not even stand up.  I called our regular Vet and of course they were closed on Sunday.  They referred me to Crossroads Animal Hospital.  I called them, rushed Dolly there and boy was I suprised and pleased.  The facility was clean and beautiful.  The staff was exceptional and they took immediate action with Dolly.  I picked her up the next morning and she was much better.  I would recommend Crossroads to everyone.< /Text>

<Review>This place is such a ripoff. How can you charge someone money before your dog gets any treatment done?? How ridiculous can this place be. They couldn't find out what was wrong with my dog and yet kept suggesting other things to be done and nothing even worked after all. They take your money I really don't recommend this place. Bad bad experience.< /Review>< pics>

If I could leave NO STAR as a option, I would. They dont even deserve one star for their shoddy diagnosis. I never leave reviews but for this place I just had to let others know so that they will not be taken advantaged of.

My husband took our bulldog there because of breathing problems. They then looked at his mouth and proceeded to tell us that my dog has a tumor without a biopsy or a sample. They immediately wanted us to go for tumor removal at $2700. We asked to see the tumor and of course they claim that it would not be a good idea for my husband to see it because “the dog might get excited.” They did not want show it to us. We knew something was wrong there. Finally, They took a picture of a mass in my dog’s mouth and said they have to remove it before they can check the tumor. Really????? Surgery before a biopsy? They examined him and His vitals were all positive—an indication that he is not suffering from a deadly tumor that they claim “we should act on as soon as possible.”

We took our dog out of that place and immediately got a second opinion at ANIMAL CARE CLINIC in bellflower.
Guess what? No tumor, just bad teeth was the culprit. My dog has an appointment for dental surgery at a fraction of the cost of the supposed tumor surgery! Dr sal at animal care clinic showed us his mouth and could not find a tumor! We showed the new clinic the diagnosis from crossroads and they could not find this TUMOR after several examinations. My husband was in the examination room with our dog. Animal care clinic was totally transparent and made sure we are a part of the process unlike crossroads who separated us from our dog.

I would never recommend anyone to take their beloved pets at crossroads. They should be ashamed of themselves for taking advantage of pet owners at their time of need. They really work on the pet owner’s fear of losing their pet.

Go to ANIMAL CARE CLINIC in bellflower. They are great and professional! Hope this post helps others out there with their vet decision.</review>

My 9 week old Dachshund was terribly ill and frail. We took her to Crossroads for a second opinion. The fact that the lab is there was a huge plus. We were given estimates before any work was performed. She had to spend the night. The staff were all very kind and helpful walking us thru step by step. My puppy isn’t out of the woods just yet, however I’m confident that because of the care she received at Crossroads she’ll be ok. I would recommend this facility to anyone who needs emergency care for their pet. We wish the Dr had a practice of her own so we could continue care with her... but no such luck. Thank you for all you did for our puppy!< /Text>

<Review>Summation: Shysters of the first degree. Crossroads Animal Emergency feeds on the emotions of animal lovers and instills fear from a position of authority with the ultimate goal of squeezing money out of you. Crossroads is the most disgusting establishment I have ever experienced. Completely devoid of ethics, honesty, and full of nothing but greed. Truly, they should be out of business. Anyone else who has experienced this awful place PLEASE file a complaint with the California Veterinary Medical Board (google it, you can file a complaint online). Also note the positive reviews appear fake and have few other reviews to their username. Read all of the horror stories the negative reviews detail here; based on my experience they are no exaggeration. Just thinking about this place gets me worked up and reminds me how low some people can stoop for a buck.

Full review of my experience:

I regrettably visited this emergency vet when my 5 month old kitten got a cut and needed stitches late at night. My kitten seemed fine and in good spirits, no blood was coming out, but I was obviously concerned since her skin was open with a ~2 inch cut. The first warning sign with Crossroads was when I called to get an opinion on the risks of waiting until the morning (6hr wait) or if I should take her in immediately. They made me fearful, "we really can't say anything unless you take her in", without asking any questions or listening to me. Fair enough, I'll take her in. I love my cat to death and I want her to live a long life. No need to risk her life for some sleep.

I take her in. Before I even sit down or sign my name they take my cat into the back. No place I've been to has taken my cat away like that. Not only that, she's taken to the back and the room my friend and I are taken to isn't the same room as my kitten. I'm getting a very strange vibe. This is more notable considering the experience at the hospital I eventually took her to where I carried my cat into the exam room, took her out of the carrier myself, showed the cut on her stomach myself, and stayed with her the whole time until I left her with the vet.

Back to Crossroads: Within 10 minutes of being there they have 3 different people talk to me and they all talk with hushed inflection as if it's a dire situation. Their play on fear did work on me.They tell me it will be $1500-1700 for the surgery to give her stitches. I was stunned, but as my mind was racing I reasoned that if that's what it cost, then fine. They're the authority, I don't know anything about animals or injuries. I should trust them to not gouge me in this difficult situation, who would do that when we all just want to care for our pets? Well, this place gladly gouges people. Luckily my close friend was there and convinced me to tell them that I can't do it because I don't have the money, because I really don't.  My friend also picked up on the bizarre vibe of the workers there too.

We told them we can't afford it, so what are the risks of taking her home and waiting, and how can we make sure my kitten is okay for the next 5-6 hours? They offer ZERO advice or recommendations, they go straight into describing severe infection, skin peeling back and rotten to the point of being unable to be sutured, as if that is what my kitten faces if we don't pay up. Fear. Nothing but fear and lies is what they gave us. We said we wanted to take my cat and go. The creep leaves the room and comes back a few minutes later, like a timeshare salesmen and shows us a paper with a reduced price. $1200. What is this insanity? This isn't a negotiation, I don't want to do business with you, give me my cat so I can go. And why wouldn't you offer the lower price in the first place if you could do it for that much?

They hold my cat hostage in the back until I pay $75 just for the visit. More greed. I kept an eye on my kitten until morning. She got the surgery elsewhere that day, I picked her up & paid $510 and she recovered in a few days to perfect health.

Please don't submit yourself to this horrible place. Find anywhere else.</Review></record></dataset><record>

<text>Don't go here if you don't have to.  Find another hospital.  I had to wait for months before I could write a review because I'm STILL upset with what happened.  Within minutes of the staff taking my pet in the back, she collapsed and could not breath.  I don't know what they did back there.  While all of this was happening the doctor was in the room with me asking the exact same questions the tech asked me before they took my pet.  In the meanwhile she is left with whoever was in the back not knowing what to do.  The doctor should have been there with the sick pet!  They actually ran in the room urgently telling the doctor he was needed.  She died that night.  It was a horrible experience.  I had questions two days later for the doctor.  Left a couple messages but he never called me back.   TERRIBLE!< /text>< pictures>

Went in on Sunday morning at 2am .  My pregnant dog could not push out her pups.  The receptionist was very rude and criticised me for not having my dog fixed
The doctors assistant was very rushed in explaining my payment options.  The only staff member that was an over all dear and sincere in helping my situation was the female doctor that examined my dog.
I do not ever plan to visit that facility again, if I can help it.  One star from me.  Poor people management skills.< /Review>

<rating>1</rating><review>This is a money hungry business, NOT an animal care center. Find another, emergency or 24 hr veterinary. They will compliment you and your animal as a coax to lure you into believing they have your best interest at heart. THEY DON'T!! They come back and forth into the exam room with different evaluations contradicting their diagnosis when you question them. They literally tried to convince me into having every test, scan, treatment they offered while offering no insight to what could be wrong with my dog. After I rejected all their EXPENSIVE (very over priced) tests, I asked for a fever reducer and possibly an antibiotic to start my dog, they very angrily refused and said she really doesn't have a high fever, while at the beginning of the visit they pleaded with me to get her started on an IV, catheter, rush blood tests because her "fever" was so high and she was in distress that required Immediate attention???? Please don't let yourself or your animal go through this manipulation in your time of need. They prey on the emotions and vulnerability of animal lovers. (They also inserted a catheter without my consent, while the receptionist assured me nothing would be done to my dog before consulting me)

<review>This is the worst place to go for emergencies. All they care about is money. My poor puppy was having seizures and they did absolutely nothing because I could not afford to pay $500 just for tests not the treatment. They sent me and my puppy home but not without charging me for them doing nothing what so ever. They did not even offer advice on what to do if the seizures continue. I do not recommend. They didn't try to help at all. You really have to be evil if you can send away a sick 3 month old puppy. Hope this place goes out of business.< /review>< date>

At the time that I went, the staff was actually kind and friendly.
My cat developed a bump behind one of her legs. It was very painful for her to move around, so I immediately called and was told to bring her in right away. It ended up being an abscess (most likely from a cat fight). I think I was overcharged and could have found a better deal somewhere else, but my cat was in pain and I didn't want to make my poor girl suffer any longer. It was busy that night and I remember waiting a long time, but they performed a clean service and gave me instructions for medication. My cat was immediately better.
I get paranoid about the competency of vets and their techs these days, so I appreciate that I had a good visit there. I would just recommend having multiple vet clinics on your phone in case of an unforeseen event. You might get a better deal.</text>

I had a horrible experience at this hospital. My dog was bleeding from her nose the doctor told me they had to operate her from her nose because there was a little ball inside her nose. After the operation she got worst she didn't want to eat or drink water. She was weaker everyday and she also got an infection from this hospital
and now she is dead. This hospital killed my dog. I don't recommend anyone to go to this hospital. They just want your money and they don't care about the animals.<//review>

Our dog got hit by car while we were visiting family in Downey. It was the worse feeling ever and we came to crossroads to get her taken care of. They were so nice, professional and sweet in our time of need. Thank you to the staff for being so sweet and genuine in providing care for both us and our dog.</Text>

<review>Me and my wife brought our dog here after she was ran over, I turned my dog to them and she was breathing normally. Supposedly she started panicking like crazy and that they had administer oxygen for 85$, and the office visit was 75$ (which is expensive when I have gone to clinics in the past for less than half that.) They administered something for the pain thankfully, but they have not done anything apart from that, they said they need to run diagnostics first which will be about 2 grand, each x ray is 225$ and they wanted six x rays, plus they wanted to run some blood work. Well I am wondering when are they going to treat her and at what cost? I request for them to cast the legs that where damaged so I can take her to a doctor in Tijuana because I live in San Diego. We wanted them clean her wounds too but they said they cant because they have to put her to sleep first. The doctor then came and said she is in critical condition and that she can die at any moment, that might not make being transferred to another vet. I took the risk and took her anyways because our bill was going to come out to 5,000 if she stayed the night at that hospital. In the end we paid 448$ for a cast on uncleaned, untreated legs, oxygen, pain medication, and the pain reliever they gave her while she was with them about an hour and a half. I took her to my doctor, as soon as I brought her in he started treating he. He immediately started cleaning the wounds, cutting the skin that was hanging off her legs. He told me luckily only her legs where damaged by the accident, that nothing was broken and their is no internal bleeding. He said she will recover in 2-4 months. I was so relieved because the doctors here at this hospital told me she was going to die, she would not be able walk anymore, and would not treat her until "diagnostics" were done. They tried to manipulate our fear to pay them thousands of dollars. My doctor even said that they could have easily cleaned her wounds at least to avoid infection. So....... if you are fortunate enough to have extra cash, do not come her, they will play on your fear and run every test and administer anything possible to charge you the most. (By the way my doctor only charged me 88$ for the full treatment AND the medications with extra bandages. If your pet needs expensive surgery, or something alike, its worth the drive, even flight. The doctors in Mexico genuinely care for the animals and they know what they are doing.) In the end I am happy she on her way to a full recovery :)</review>< Name>

<Review>DO NOT TAKE YOUR ANIMAL HERE. ....what a joke!!!!! My dog got bit and doc saying they need to prep him for surgery and will be there for a couple days. ...I told him no way. ..he hot bit but wasn't gushing blood...was acting normal and walking around. ...then doc says well let's do a diagnostic text. ...his assistant came in room and I saw  $895 JUST for diagnostic test. ...asked for my dog back ...declined services only to pay $130
Immediately went to VCA. .... said no deep bites.... no staples needed. ..gave meds and walked out at $232.
THIS PLACE IS ONLY ABOUT MONEY! !!!!

<Review>I took my cat to this office today (this morning) when she was lethargic and not able to stand.  I had her tested for the cat AIDS virus and I was told that it was negative, but this doctor tested her and said it came back positive for the virus, but that she contracted it from another cat who possibly came into my yard.  The initial fee to do blood work was 155.00, then they came back and told me that xrays would be an additional 401.00 dollars!  I paid it, because I wanted to save my cat.  Well, I'm still not sure if I was taken to the cleaners, but the doctor showed me her
x-rays and said that her kidneys were failing and that she had a mass in her chest.  I could barely see it, but I was very emotional and my cat couldn't stand up at all and was very weak, so she was definitely sick, but I could stand seeing her in any pain.  I guess I should've taken her to another vet, but I didn't know what to do, but I decided to take her out of her pain and they charged me another 375.00 to put her to sleep and to cremate her and deliver her ashes along with a paw print and her name on a redwood pine box to me in about 3 weeks.  After reading these reviews, I wish I had waited and taken her somewhere else, but at least she is not in pain anymore, but I feel very guilty for not taking her for a 2nd opinion.  I roughly spend around 1,000 dollars and feel horrible after the fact now that I see the bad reviews.

it's a horror, they only care about money and they do not care about the poor animals, they are still dying, they do not care, they have to pay for attention, where the love and professionalism of the animals remains! of course they had to pay but annoying that they first want to see that you have to pay then they charged $ 450 and they said take him home and if he survives they take him to a clinic tomorrow< /review>

<Text>These people are in no way animal lovers. They prey on the emotions of loving pet owners to squeeze you for as much money as they can. Took my aunt's dog in last night. He's a small breed who was bitten by a Rottweiler. The laceration to his abdomen was large but not life threatening. Doctor comes and paints a horrific picture that dog is in shock, and they need to stabilize him before surgery. This was after already having us pay $750, which only covered x-rays, vitals and diagnosis. Itemized bill said $80 for blood pressure!!
They wanted a total of $2,550 to close his wound. I told the doctor we didn't have this kind of money. She went as far as to tell me to ask friends and family for PayPal donations.  We brought our dog home, wound open and in pain but not in "shock". Will take him to a vet clinic as soon as it's open.
You people are crooks, and unscrupulous. I wish I would have read reviews before taking our pup in.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><date>1484582645738<//date>< Rating>

My sister's dog got hit my a motorcycle a few days ago and we came to this hospital with some hope to save her. We knew she was in pretty bad shape but, we had blind hope.  As soon as we arrived, they were very gentle and made sure to keep informing us on what they were doing with Luna (German Shepard), one of the most comforting thing they did was inform us on how she was licking some of the employees. She was in severe pain and her injuries were worse than we could have ever imagined. There really wasn't much they can do to save her, so we unfortunately had to euthanize her (Rest In Peace, Luna). But I just want to say they were so sympathetic and patience with my sister and I. I really appreciate all they did for us even if there wasn't much to do. Luna was supposed to turn three today (Happy Birthday, RIP).<//text>

I took my cat to this office today (this morning) when she was lethargic and not able to stand.  I had her tested for the cat AIDS virus and I was told that it was negative, but this doctor tested her and said it came back positive for the virus, but that she contracted it from another cat who possibly came into my yard.  The initial fee to do blood work was 155.00, then they came back and told me that xrays would be an additional 401.00 dollars!  I paid it, because I wanted to save my cat.  Well, I'm still not sure if I was taken to the cleaners, but the doctor showed me her
x-rays and said that her kidneys were failing and that she had a mass in her chest.  I could barely see it, but I was very emotional and my cat couldn't stand up at all and was very weak, so she was definitely sick, but I could stand seeing her in any pain.  I guess I should've taken her to another vet, but I didn't know what to do, but I decided to take her out of her pain and they charged me another 375.00 to put her to sleep and to cremate her and deliver her ashes along with a paw print and her name on a redwood pine box to me in about 3 weeks.  After reading these reviews, I wish I had waited and taken her somewhere else, but at least she is not in pain anymore, but I feel very guilty for not taking her for a 2nd opinion.  I roughly spend around 1,000 dollars and feel horrible after the fact now that I see the bad reviews.

DO NOT TAKE YOUR ANIMAL HERE. ....what a joke!!!!! My dog got bit and doc saying they need to prep him for surgery and will be there for a couple days. ...I told him no way. ..he hot bit but wasn't gushing blood...was acting normal and walking around. ...then doc says well let's do a diagnostic text. ...his assistant came in room and I saw  $895 JUST for diagnostic test. ...asked for my dog back ...declined services only to pay $130
Immediately went to VCA. .... said no deep bites.... no staples needed. ..gave meds and walked out at $232.
THIS PLACE IS ONLY ABOUT MONEY! !!!!

My German Shepard Inca was an unfortunate victim of a dog fight. I had taken my other dogs to Crossroads in an emergency and recalled the quick and efficent care they provided. When we arrived they took her in immediately. Luckily because of their quick action and extensive loving care Inca is doing well and is recovering amazingly. I love the staff because they really care about the animals that walkin. They are super friendly and give you are your pet the best of care. If you ever have an emergency with your pet you know that you are in good hands with Crossroads.< /Text>

These people will prey on the emotional distress of anybody who loves their sick or injured animal. My little sister's puppy either ate a bee or got scratched by a cat which caused the left side of his jowl to swell over the course of 5 hours. The doctor on duty tried to tell my worried sister and mother that it was a venomous snake bite and that the puppy needs antivenom and over night observation as well as a laundry list of unnecessary treatment and who knows what the total would have been.  I study and collect snakes as a hobby and I know for a fact it was not a snake bite of any kind, yet the doctor insists it was a venomous snake bite...on my 23lb puppy. Were that the case, the puppy would have been dead hours ago. Absolutely predatory and pathetic.< /Text>

<user_name>Jennifer Garcia<//user_name><rating>5<//rating><text>Back in August of 2015, frustrated and financially raped by another vet clinic who didn't do anything but test some blood, i brought my 4mo German Shepherd pup Heidi in. I had just gotten her two days prior, and she was already showing signs of Parvo. Crossroads staff was SO attentive as soon as we walked in, both to Heidi and me as well, and offered a couple of methods of payment that were flexible for my budget. The staff took her in and the Dr. on duty was quick and accurate, and i'm convinced that's why my Heidi is alive and doing typical puppy things, was because of THIS clinic. THANK YOU, i will come here again and recommend to anyone.< /text>< pictures>

Very clean hospital.  The staff and doctors are very compassionate.  They explained the procedures that would need to take place until I felt comfortable that I understood.  This is my 2nd time I've had to bring my pets here.  I would definatley recommend Crossroads to anyone I know.<//review>

This place was horrible. To begin with, these people did absolutely nothing to help my dog. According to them they didn't have the medicine to cure ringworm on my dog. They charged me $110 for absolutely nothing. Keep in mind that ringworm is highly contagious to other pets as well as humans. I am 6 months pregnant and these people sent me home with a contagious pet after charging me $110 for nothing. I wouldn't even recommend this place to my worst enemy. WASTE OF TIME, WASTE OF MONEY, DON'T BOTHER EVER GOING TO THIS PLACE!!!!!</Review>

They tried to calm me down because they care about the owner as much as I do the pet.My dog had to stay for emergency surgery from the top of the neck I was going to have surgery the next day. My dog some small celebrity on Facebook so they ended up getting 12 or 13 calls asking how late she was doing the next night .It's nice to know you have friends like that then you don't have to family. I needless to say she came back and did fantastic. And I asked him why I couldn't bring lady and then bring the stitches take them out.Tell me calmly said a lot of people want to go to their vet to do that. I had no vet and use people were fantastic and they said of course the real be no charge that soon but the entire bill all the follow-ups are included. I would take my dog back in a heartbeat they just had a funny ours her sometimes are not open in the daytime and that's usually when pets have a shoes .What maybe crossroads does not know that, besides the lady being so nice to meet the manager or supervisor, should I had a cat that had broke his  in the daytime.Norcross words was an open at that time but what's amazing I'm in Long Beach and what they don't tell you is they have a little note on the top of the door in Long Beach at this other place and they said if we're not there or you need more professional emergency help to take your dog or cat to crossroads. That was phenomenal because they have no affiliation with this animal hospital whatsoever<//text><pics>None</pics><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

Staff and doctors were great to my wife, me, and my frenchie.  3 trips in 4 days for ivdd issues.  I get the prices are higher than your normal vet, but do you people leaving one star reviews realize this is an emergency clinic!?!?  Er costs more than my doctor.   Every time.  Especially after hours. Seems like common sense.  I am thankful to have an emergency clinic so close and to have a healthy pup.  Mahalo to all the staff that helped Hamsteak.< /Review>

I wish i had read all this comments before i took my dog to this clinic.  They don't care about aninals. I went there last night with my dog who got run over by a car he had a broken leg and 2 ribs. They charge me 800 just to take the x rays and pain medication and wanted to do a surgery that was going to cost over 5,000 thats ridiculous. Plus they didn't know if he was going to loose his leg. They saw my 4 kids crying and didn't give me an option to take him somewhere else cheaper so I end up paying 885 dollars to put my dog to sleep.< /Text>

I had an emergency with my dog. He was having seizures. We arrive there and gave us an estimate of 75 dollar per the visit plus the medicine.  At the end of the night they charged us $1200 for the night. And even though we spend that much money they didn't give our dog medecine. They just give him a relaxing pill. And they said it will only work for that moment. He could have another one in the next minutes so it was just a waste money. Will not recommend this place to any dog owner.<//Review>

<Text>I just wanted everyone to know that Crossroads is absolutely the best. I will always be grateful for all the love and care they showed to my little Kanga when she swallowed a piece of thread. I was already feeling pretty down when I had to put my dog to sleep,then I lost my job all in the same week just a couple of weeks before Kanga's incident with the thread... Now , I feared I would lose Kanga too. But thanks to the love and care of Crossroads she is still the lively and special cat I love!  I'm still   always looking for lose threads and any strings on the floor or carpet  because I know she's always carrying things in her mouth (like cat toys etc.)Thank you Doctors and Staff at Crossroads.< /Text>< pictures>

< Review>
This complaint is reguarding Claire Ortega DMV, who was supposed to extract hardened fecal matter from my cat's colon at Crossroads Animal Emergency at 11507 E. Rosecrans Ave. in the city of Norwalk, CA. on Nov. 15th, 2017.

Never during the consultation did Dr. Ortega or any of the staff mention to me that they would NOT be able to extract all the fecal matter in 3.5 hours. If that had been the case, I would have taken the cat to a facility that would spend more time on my pet and get the job done.

Why would I pay Dr. Ortega $1,175 dollars for incomplete work?

This facility also destroyed the x-rays of what fecal matter remained in my cat so that I could not see them. When I asked if they could retrieve them so I could see what they left they wanted to charge me another $100.00 for new x-rays!

Dr. Ortega was more concerned with taking my money and clocking out rather than completing a job she was paid to complete. She was willing to finish what she had begun as soon as the facility opened as long as I PAYED AGAIN?!

Now my cat is still suffering and I have to pay another doctor to finish what Dr. Claire Ortega DVM could not accomplish. This is robbery!

I have also filed a complaint to Veterinary Medical Board about Dr. Ortega's deceit and thieving approach.</Review>

<Review>They killed out cat, the story is the same as the other pets they killed. Biggest mistake you can make is taking your pet to these heartless jerks! They never treat, they just put pets on oxygen and talk to you about how many test you can pay them to do.< /Review>< pics>

It broke at the knee when she was running, started screaming so loud the neighbors came out.  Mocha is Chihuhua, Poodle, Terrior.  Buff color with an attitude.  The doctor that put her back together is Amazing!  I forgot her name, she has blonde short hair and sounds like she is from Australia.  Robert in the lobby was also very helpful!  Kudos to your team.  Oh I must say, my Mocha after surgery was of course in pain, but we had the medicine for that and she took no problem.  That very next night I was going to put her in her kennel, when all of a sudden she started screaming!  I was oh god what is happening.  So I left her alone, I tried again and the same thing.  So I called my son Julian, I said she does not want me to move her.  I was thinking because she sleeps in my bed with me and hubby and my Sasha (Chihuahua).  So my son plays with her and she is still medicated from surgery, he puts her in her little house which I have on a chair next to my bed.  She's fine. That night was first night after surgery, so I took her back thinking she was in pain.  They said she was in Euphoria with meds, that it could be.  They gave me more meds just in case.  Well it was me she was screaming at, after the next few nights trying to put her in her cage to sleep, so my son Julian took over that task.  But Again Thank You For All You Have Done For My Mocha.<//Text>< Pics>

<Text>This facility saved my dog's life. My dog ate a brownie made with marijuana and almost immediately lost control of her legs. My partner and I flipped out, we didn't know what to do or where to go. Additionally, we were new to the area and didn't know who to trust. Crossroads was the first facility we went to, and I couldn't have been happier with their care. Thanks, y'all!</Text>< Pics>

<Rating>1<//Rating><user>102178170979782072970</user><Review>My dog got ran over by a car, took him here as I was recommended by pico animal hospital. They took him in, made us wait awhile before we got called in. The called us in and waited a while longer, I'm guessing to built emotional suspense. blow fish looking guy came in telling me " you are going to pay 991 sign here" I felt as if I were in a car dealership dealing with a salesman lol I told him as well. Regardless I signed because I honestly believed my dog was going to die. Waited 2 more hours until they called me again and said no surgery was needed that they would HIGHLY recommend me keeping my dog for another night for the small price of 1,700 dollars more. I said no way give me my dog back.
ANYWAY NOT RECOMMENDED. If you can wait until the next day, then do so.
They take advantage of people emotions.< /Review>< name>

I had a emergency with April a maltipoo that another vet caused and crossroads saved her life and now is doing very well Thanks.

If I ever have another emergency I will be sure to go back there. Thank you very mulch crossroads from me and april.

I took my puppy yorkie in because she was vomiting foam, had diarrhea, and shaking. As soon as we got there they refused to help my dog until they approved my credit card. By the time they finished all that my yorkie's heart had stopped beating so they did cpr and werent able to revive her. Even after they took their time, they still charged me almost $400 for the cpr that was done too late. If they had helped my dog when I got there maybe she'd be alive. Vets are supposed to love animals and care for them. These people only care about the money.<//text>

< Review>
Emergency has always cost more that's a no Brainer what bugged me is they already have a amount before you walk in the door we were told it would be between 600 to 900 dollars for diagnostics like xrays blood work of course oxygen which I know my pet needed when I told them I had those and only needed him stabilized so I could transfer him to regular veterinarian my bill still remained in the 800.00 dollar range because now they charged for oxygen and every little thing they did at five times what it would cost at my regular vet and even though things are necessary and it's the middle of the night I don't think gouging people makes a good impression so had I known they were that corrupt I would have made the decision that I ultimately had to make at emergency and put my boy to sleep at his regular vet and avoided the thousand dollar bill for 45 minutes of my boys last time on earth< /Review>

Bad experience. Told me what my dog ate could have already done damage in first 30 mins. They took my dog in the back and I waited four hrs until I finally got an update. I asked what was being done this whole time if it was so important to get the treatment started? No good answer given. Said taking vitals? And, I needed to sign off on treatment. Really? I was in the waiting room the entire time. I don't care how busy you are, if you know what treatment needs to be done, bring me the paperwork, let me sign so you can take care of my dog. Never coming back here again. Vets and techs are not the greatest. Front desk staff is condescending. I would not recommend this place to anyone. If this place is the closest to you, find the next closest.< /Text>

<review>when my chiweenie's belly was hard and expanded, had blood in the stool and had a yelping fit, we looked for an emergency vet on google and found crossroads. the staff was very friendly and caring (at first), the facility is clean and seating area is comfy. the staff was patient as we explained the symptoms: hard expanded belly, bright red blood in stool, and we explicitly told them he has a history of back issues. that's all the positive. now the negs... (the wait was very long, which they said was due to a critical case they had, but after reading other reviews, it seems making you wait a long time is part of their psychological tactics) my dog was taken to the back and examined there, which i would have rather had done with me in the room just to be sure it was thorough. the dr then suggested we do xrays, blood work and urinalysis.. which i understand is standard... but we have limited funds, and since he was drinking and eating and not lethargic, we decided to just do the xray first and go from there. the vet then went to the back and came back to tell us about the xray (without showing us the xrays), said there was no obvious blockage, but there wasnt much else they could conclude from just an xray and strongly suggested blood work.. suggested so strongly she came off as a condescending pushy jerk, like she was trying to make us feel bad about not being able to afford the extra tests.. she might have just been on the trailing end of a long shift, but that kind of attitude made me feel like they just cared about getting more money out of us. we have 4 dogs and have had a lot of experience with greedy vets and know enough about vet medicine to know that since it wasnt an obvious blockage, it could wait til the next day when we could see our regular vet.
so the next morning we went to our regular vet... and after looking at the xray for just about a min, he told us the whole problem. yes, he has a back injury, and could clearly see the vertebra that were damaged, 3 points near the tail have significant compression, one is almost completely compressed... that causes my doggie pain when he poops, so he doesnt evacuate completely, which caused constipation and gas... (he showed us on the xray the compressed areas and all the gas pockets which were very clearly visible, if the crossroads vet missed this, they need to go back to school)... the straining from the constipation caused a blood vessel to burst and that was the blood id seen in the stool. he gave us rimadyl for his back pain, and told us to give him gas x for the bloating.
we wouldnt have been able to find the problem without the xray, so thanx to crossroads for doing that.... but they definitely didnt need to do blood work or urinalysis to find the problem. they either were withholding the information about the compressed vertebra and gas to force us to do the other testing, or their vets just arent educated enough to figure out this very simple problem.
this experience just adds to the reasons why i would travel a thousand miles to get to tags a1 in santa clarita to see their honest vets.
in case of an extreme life threatening emergency, sure, get your pet to any facility that can help, even if they're greedy bastards.
crossroads' estimate for xrays, blood work, and urinalysis was almost $600 (just the visit and xray was almost $300) , and then there would be a cost for whatever treatment they would have recommended and boarding costs to keep him there for 'observation'. the cost at my regular vet for the consultation and medication was less than $100, and problem solved.
**and now that i have looked through their reviews, the positive ones are mostly vague and seem fake...  i hate how places like this take advantage of distressed people who love their pets. this is the reason why at hermon dog park's yappy hour we often have pet education seminars with honest vets to go over basics. we need to be educated so we dont get screwed over.

Friendly staff and very clean, but unecessary long waiting, after being check by the vet over 20mins wait for an estimate, dont like the fact that they take your pet away where you cant see to check virals an all, long wait to see the vet and long wait to leave, also a bit over priced.< /text>

If your low Income dont come here.

My cat was attacked by a dog and the wound got infected, I took her as soon as I saw the wound.
If my animal has another emergency I wont be coming here.
I'll start with the good, they were nice, they helped me immediately, they explained thoroughly the problem and the procedure.
The bad, dont expect to pay less than $200, you have two options pay with care credit or cash. They pretty much wanted me to pay $1367 upfront though they said "we dont want to rush or push you into choosing the $1800 option" I chose the cheaper one since I wanted to help my cat but I only work part time $9/hr for 16 hrs, my brothers girlfriend had to loan me $867 to pay. First of all it was suppose to be less than that they called me at 1am to tell me they had to fully anesthetize my cat because the infectiom was too deep and it would be another $180, I didnt have anymore money I used all my savings to pay not more than 30 minutes before. so my friend had to loan me more but they needed her confirmation they called me several times because they wanted her to send it immediately or they wouldnt start! I told them she had to work at 6am but they still wanted me to call her, after I told them she wasnt answering probably because she was asleep they wanted me to keep calling her.
I went to sleep around 3 am and was suppose to pick her up at 9am. They didnt give me any medication, they gave her antibiotics and they stapled her up.
Well guess what 4 days later her wound had become reinfected what I took for discharge as they had warned me of was not. Her wound became undehescent and I was going to put her down because they wanted to charge me another $1300 for their mistakes. They did not clean the infection out thoroughly and she had to be stitched closed not stapled because of the type of wound plus they just folded the skin over and placed the staples which wouldn't promote healing. Then there was only one option left to put her to sleep which would be $200! Well I decided I would take her to the LA animal care & control and put her to sleep but a miracle happened the ASPCA gave me a coupon and she had her surgery again for $225. Shes way better now no thanks to Crossroads.  They're nice but their policy is one where money is what decides whether theyre gonna do all they can for your pet.  Go somewhere else, this place should be a last resort.</Text>

Staff was great, though the vet Dr Mc Donald is a horrible horrible vet, will never go to this place again while he is a vet there. My dog had a seizure one night and we had just adopted him from the pound only a couple months before so we did not know he had them. When we took him there at midnight right when the seizure happened the staff were great making us know things will be ok and they would be able to work with our budget and do what they can, though as soon as Dr Mc Donald shows up he starts accusing us of giving our dog DRUGS! the heck is wrong with him... My mother who was not even there with us was brought into the conversation by the doctor he was trying to say she gave our dog marijuana just because my dog had a seizure! He wanted us to pay $200 just so he could give him coal to dilute his stomach.

We decided just to pay the visit and wait until the next day to visit our usual vet at the  Downey landing, there they told us that our dog naturally had seizures and that there were no 'drugs' found in his system ...

WILL NEVER NEVER GO TO THIS PLACE! The Dr. only tried milking money out of us just because we were young he thought we were stupid!! and TREATED US LIKE WE WERE!! He should not be allowed to work as a FAMILY veterinarian if he is going to be treating people like they are stupid or that they are poisoning their pets with drugs!

<Review>FYI: I am medical Professional and am familiar with the nuances of Orthopedic Surgery and have done countless HOURS of research to find Dr Blackwood, one of THE few proficient in CCL TIGHTROPE Surgery. We traveled from Las Vegas, it WAS WORTH IT!!

STATS: Mr Mighy is 75lb Pitbull Terrier
DEFECT:
Ruptured and Completly torn Cranial Cruciate Ligament [CCL]
PROCEDURE:
TIGHTROPE Repair using KEVLAR CARBON COMPOSITE
BENEFITS:
Decrease Surgical Recovery, Less Invasive than other more freq performed procedures
DIFFICULTY:
a. Finding a Orthopediuc Surgeon Proficient and comfortable enough to Increase the odds for Positive Outcome
b. The mass MISINFORMATION CAMPAIGN by other Vets that will sell you what it is THEY are confined knowledge of.
OUTCOME: Found, Dr Blackwood, HIGHLY PROFICIENT ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON in CCL Repair. IMO: Dr Blackwood is a Sleeping Giant in this Field. Her mild manner and demeanor, dont let this fool you. She awakens the GIANT inside her when it comes to the OR ! UNBELIEVEABLE!

Our Letter TO Dr Blackwood and CROSSROADS ANIMIAL HOSPITAL:

Dear Dr Blackwood: I cannot begin to tell you one of lifes BIGGEST pleasures is seeing such a POSITIVE outcome w. the CCL Surgery you had done on MIGHTY.

Now 4 months out and watching mighty run in the field we take him for a walk at, and to glide so effortlessly.
That is SO FULFILLING and heartwarming.

We do owe his success story to your skilled and most excellent efforts! Thank You for being one of the few who are so proficient in this Tightrope procedure in the WEST.

Thank you again so so much! Words could never describe the Joy I have on a regular basis seeing this dog Do so well now. For sure we never know how lucky we are till we lose such a function, then regain it. PRICELESS!<//Review>< Time>

<review>Really bad experience with all the Doctors and Staff. I spent four thousand dollars on my cat for crystals in the urine.  They didn't give my poor cat pain killer's. I went back for a follow up because my cat was still in pain. They tried to get me to spend another three thousand to help him. Thankfully I went to another 24/7 hour Vet Hospital in Cerritos. They told me my cat was in healing process and they didn't give him pain killers or all the medicine that was required. In my opinion, eventually he will get sick again, that way I go back to them.< /review>< pictures>

They wanted to remove my cat's eyeball!!!!

2am...I hear a cat crying at the door. It was my black kitten. His beautiful yellow eyes were seeping red liquid. He had a large gash from his lid to below his eye. Immediately I took him into my arms and brought him in the house. All I could do was hold him and love him. I didn't know what to do. My poor kitten's eye was bleeding. A cat must have scratched him.

My boyfriend is a DJ, so I waited for him to come home to see what we should do and what our finances would allow. 3:30am...immediately we searched for a 24 hours clinic and we found Crossroads.

The representative was nice and welcoming on the phone and in person. Of course there was no wait. The took him to the room to be examined. The nurse said his eye has a scratch and must be removed for $2000 or it would be infected and he will die in 2-3 days. Another option is to put the kitten to sleep...Definitely not our option. My boyfriend hugged me tighter. We didn't know what our other options were. We did not have the funds to complete this surgery today. We did, however, get him antibiotics and a few other medicine. It's expected that cost will be higher than a regular vet. We paid $500 for examination and medicine to take home.

I held my kitten as much as I could knowing that he might die in a few days....

It has been 1 year now and his eyes look perfect. I can't believe he could have walked around with no eye and eyelid sewn shut. I cannot believe a hospital would do such a thing just to get money. My cat lady neighbor (she has had over 100 cats in her lifetime) said that was absurd. This happens a lot to cats who are not neutered and it heals itself. So, would I recommend this place? Not necessarily unless you absolutely have to take your pet in. There are other places that was recommend to me that I will go to next time if my pet has an emergency...that will not offer to remove my kitten's eye.< /text>

I wish I would’ve read the reviews before I took my puppy here. Now I’m just broke and they did nothing to help my girl. $600 on an X-ray that they probably won’t even give me a copy of.< /text>

(Translated by Google) Bottom line: don't go here. They only care about money. The first thing they do is charge you $ 95 before asking about your pet. Absurd. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME, MONEY and ENERGY!

(Original)
En resumen: no vayas aquí. Solo les importa el dinero. Lo primero que hacen es cobrarle $ 95 antes de preguntar por su mascota. Absurdo. ¡NO PIERDA SU TIEMPO, DINERO y ENERGÍA!</text>

You get what you pay for. Sometimes the prices are good compared to something like Amazon. They have a few employees in like the plumbing and hardware area that seem to know what they’re talking about and are pretty helpful, but don’t ever expect expert advice from HD. As long as you know what items you need for sure, then this is your place for probably the cheapest of that item. They’re pretty good about being able to tell you where most things are if you can’t find them in the store.<//Text>

He was very professional,  knowledgeable and very helpful in helping me picking the right paint for my bedroom,  he even helped me picking the right shade, I even learned from him that the color we see on the paper sheet at the store will look much darker in the wall. He helped me a lot, if was not for him I would had pick a much darker color thinking that it was the color that  I  wanted, for sure I wouldn't be happy!< /review>< Pictures>

I would give the store 5 stars BUT parking lot is small with reduced parking spaces. My truck is a Ram club Cab and long bed and its impossible to make a flash visit to the store without spending 20 minutes driving around the parking lot hunting for a spot. Apart from that its everything you hope to find at a home depot store. I still prefer the one on harbor Blvd and Wilson st just across the street from Costa mesa golf club. Huge parking lot.< /review>

Terrible customer service in paint section, acting like employee is the king. Never going to this particular store.
Other stores are fairly good with services, but this store need alot of training or rehire a good and positive minded people.</review>

<review>I've been to a lot of Home Depots this one I Harbor and MacArthur in Santa Ana is the best very knowledgeable employees and they keep it real if they think something is wrong with the way you're explaining your problem or part they will let you know one thing I've learned the better you explained or describe the better they can help you the more you go the more you'll find the go to people in each department the younger ones are still learning so we don't count them out they are our future please when you talk to one and they can't help you don't get mad at them because we we're in that same spot when we were younger everybody stay safe out there wear your mask do the six feet if possible</review>< Pictures>

While the staff of this home depot are helpful and friendly. Their parking lot is a huge issue for me. It's always crowded. People approach you when you're are coming or going to your vehicle. Overall if they could figure out a way to discourage the panhandlers from camping in their parking lot and harassing their customers then I would be willing to give them a 5 star review</text>

<text>It’s a Home Depot. If you need a review to tell you about the ambiance or selection, you need to get out more. Employees are like any other big box store: sometimes they’re really helpful, other times they’re too busy to help much.

I will say this, I highly recommend downloading the Home Depot app. You can plug in the store you’re currently at, and the app will tell you exactly where anything in the store is. Makes shopping here a WHOLE lot easier.<//text>< Pics>

Fabulous Garden Center! I give that 5 stars! Beautiful, healthy plants and flowers and lots of variety too! Helpful young fellows in the Garden Center by the way, very cheerful! I would DEFINITELY recommend this Home Depot. Clean, open and lots of helpful employees as opposed to other Home Depots I have been to.< /review>

One of the largest depots in the area. Use to be a drive-thru indoor but they stopped that years ago.
They must have a large theft problem being so large and under staffed.<//Review>

<Review>The employees are quite friendly and helpful. it always helps to use the app to scan prices or to see if an item is in stock. Was able to find a promo item by scanning SKU # and it was an item that had just been delivered. thanks to the help of the employees I got what I wanted.</Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNz9KhWYlhwkpmJrdvngS2zBFLoLcDmnm4BzwAI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNWpWW2NRmjMgM_pV-vuKNCcglmmWxd-ZrQDcPN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPoMhtFFFRCxubGZlqi19ZJ4Anli6Qr6wArnPcg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNuj7yXvsFXtr4xvi5uiGyfQ1KiYW5Zpd59gh2Z=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMInbHIP0UgjBMX15A4B9oSAGD8gwM6daThGbD_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMX1visbPw-uyh81-mnXgD5TsNnpIVqbx09DwaL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< resp>

<Text>Today I found something that is rare at most Home Depots as of late:  Two employees who actually care about Customer Service:

Jake and Jessica at The Plumbing Department helped me get all the information I needed to get a Water Heater Installation quote; now... if only everyone else in the store was as customer focused, there would be no reason to shop anywhere else!<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

What can I say about the home Depot. they have what I need to get most the time for all sorts of different types of projects for work or home. This time I picked up some spray paint and clear gorilla glue. The line wasn't very bad this time I went during the day around 11:00 a.m. . I know sometimes these lines will be pretty long. Also even though there is a national coin shortage, I received change from the self checkout machine which was a plus<//Review>

<text>I love Home Depot, but nobody hits 1000...I am 72 and walk with a cane..1) Missed directed 2 times, Asked a third the location of an item, said her hand equipment was down and didn't know where it was. 2) They litterly closed off 4 isles I needed to go down 3) I bought a patio heater, asked if they could take it to check out w/required propane tank, it arrived but no propane. 3)Had question about plants I bought, the person in the garden area said they didn't have any knowledge about plants...Same visit.</text>< time>

Terrible Pro Service! I have been at the window for half an hour (and maybe longer....) and the man working here is still working with one customer (the one ahead of me). I do not know the name os the staff. Today is Saturday, 10/24/2020. Please hire a new staff. This man definitely does not what he is doing. Not productive for the store at all. There was another customer behind me walked away because he couldn’t stand the wait.
I can’t wait anymore. I’m going to another store myself. Please don’t waste your time using the “unprofessional service “ here. Right now is 1531. Got here at 1456.</review>

<review>TO CLARIFY BATTERY DROP OFF BIN-
As of 06/16/2020, Home Depot does not accept SMALL batteries; AAA batteries, AA batteries, C and D batteries. The only batteries they accept are Batteries that can be disconnected from battery charged tools. Still a great store with exceptional customer service.<//review>< username>

Rented a rototiller. Was too small for the job and they easily swapped it out for a bigger one without charging me.  They also helped to load it in my car. Thanks, Frank, and all the guys at Home Depot!</text>

This guy said he was the end of the line for a rental dispute I had. Charged my card, "unauthorized" for rental equipment that was returned "looking damaged". I will be taking this up with corporate of my unprofessional experience, the people in tool rental aren't even wearing a Home Depot apron, wearing hoodies, speaking in spanish among themselves and even taking personal calls. You need new management here. The tool rental employees are doing some highly fraudulent activity. I'm not sure who the regional manager is for this store, but they need to visit ASAP.</text>< name>

Not really one to write reviews, but I overheard and altercation with a customer in tool rental, in which they said his tool was returned damaged and were charging him. The reason why I'm writing this is that the customer asked for manager and the employees would speak in SPANISH, I knew a little so I could understand some. But, they were talking behind his back in another language, which is highly unprofessional. I'm not sure who was in the wrong with the tool rental, but the fact the employees of Home Depot would speak in another language about the customer is highly wrong and should be investigated.< /text>

Horrible customer service at garden section. Came to get a pool net they were all the way at the top shelf. Took someone 20 min to come see what I needed after I asked the cashier to call for assistance. Then another 20 min to bring it down. I should have just climbed the shelf to get myself. 😒<//review>

It never fails to amaze me how the staff here works SO FREAKING HARD TO AVOID HELPING YOU FIND ANYTHING! It's like they've all mastered the ability to avoid eye contact and then turn and avoid customers.
It doesn't help that half of the time you can't find what you need. Try buying 30 5/16x2" bolts AND finding matching outer washers, lock washers and nuts. (Hint, the lock washers are hidden elsewhere). It's insanity I tells ya!
Or, try sorting through 8'x6"x3/4" lumber trying to find 3 pieces worth buying after 9 other people have been sorting through the same lumber and which hasn't been reorganized.  Screwed ya are.
The only reason I gave this rat maze 3 stars is because, occasionally I get what I need, and some kid in the paint section was able to find what I was looking for today. Go figure.</review>

Well folks Bleach, hand sanitizer, and spray sanitizer were all back in stock for anyone who might need some. 4 of each limit but that's MORE than fair. We wouldn't have had a shortage had hoarders not beat everyone to the store in the first place but that being said if you need to pick some up it's there and normal pricing at that.</text>

Very big store and friendly staff. They have a big selection in the tools rental area. I rented a carpet cleaner and the assistant explained in detail how to operate it.< /Text>

<text>This place was great! I went to see the gardening area (AMAZING!!!) and my friend went to see the spring selection. We got helped by an employee who directed us to Ace hardware to get the spring we needed and the home depot didn't sell the proper size. We ended up finding the right spring! I'll definitely be back when it's time for gardening!<//text>< user_name>

THE worst service ever. I waited almost an hour for 30 sheets of drywall. Unacceptable. I have a business to run and literally wasted my time because you guys didn't work as a team to get stuff done quickly. I kept asking about the drywall. They kept saying oh they're working on it. I completely understand being busy but the staff could of all jumped in to help or maybe the manager get involved and help the team get ahead. It's frustrating seeing people just stand around and not help. Hour later they had the drywall finally on the forklift. Inexperienced person driving the forklift. The manager asked him if knew how to get all the drywall in with the forklift. He said yeah I know how. Turns out they wanted to put the drywall by hand into the truck. Train your staff to be more efficient. Time is money. And yes I am upset and frustrated. I wanted my team of drywallers to finished today. Now I have to wait Friday for them to be free. Making the process longer.< /Review>

Home Depot is one of the bigger if not the biggest big box hardware stores. They have pretty much everything that you can think of and what they don't have in store you can most likely find online.

I tend to visit this location for smaller items like plants for my home and office as well as home supplies that I need. But I see lots of contractors who depend on Home Depot for bigger jobs. The prices are reasonable and I've looked around and compared them with other stores. They pretty much carry everything from plants, to bbq's, refrigerators, appliances, custom made kitchens, wood panels, dry wall, extension cords, marble and granite, carpet, and anything in between.

This particular location is off MacArthur just south of Harbor. There is plenty of parking and the service is good when you can find them. That's probably my only negative is that it appears they may have cut back on staff so you don't find as many staff members as before. They also have those self checkout kiosks which help the line go by faster.

If your looking for a hardware store you can't go wrong with this place. There are others but as far as quality, price, and service is concerned they are my favorite.</Text>

<resp>None</resp><review>Upon entering the store I was greeted right away went to the plumbing department picked up power auger mcdill me all the different features of the different ones and get the one that was perfect for my job that I was doing went over to the paint department pick some paint for interior and they told me a little bit about making sure that I had primer in it I guess less expensive paint you have to do a primer and then do the regular paint That's double work I talked to Justin the manager to let him know what a good job his people were doing I went to the store in Santa Ana off of Harbor and MacArthur it seems to be one of the better stores with better help than the other ones that I've been to not saying that they're bad but I get more smiles more Hello's and the knowledge seems to be there kudos to the management the associates and a whole store in general of course my recommendation is the visitor store if you're in this area that's all thanks<//review>< pics>

I was helped at the paint area, the employee there is super rude. He will not say a word to you, he will just get the paint color you want and continue with his job. He won’t greet you at all. I bought paint and was so disappointed by the result. It looked nothing like the sample. But once again I think it was partly my fault as an inexperienced buyer and also the employee for not asking me if I had any doubts or questions. Idk I just hated his service. The cashier was also rude and lazy. All she did was just stand there, she didn’t even say thank you or anything.</Review>

Asked for some help, was told they were not able to help with a dead battery. I have shopped here for many years. I have been troubled not finding the things I need. Slowly I have been going to Lowe's more and more for these things. This is the final blow. Good luck hd. I've had website problems. Where no matter which credit card I use I can't buy anything.<//text>

Instead of taking the old and leaving the new so that I can get a plumber and install it my self. The installers just leave. What???? Now I'm stuck with setting a new delivery date plus get a plumber. Plus extra charges for delivery. What a scam. Then I just try to call to discuss this with someone and get a dead end rotation call system with Zero Help. Home Depot has gone down hill. No live person no matter how many numbers to call??? Not the customer service I expected. I'll try Lowes.<//text>< pictures>

Everything was fine until I went to check out.  After having my credit card rejected 5 times in a row, the cashear went to another register and had to ring everything up again.  This time my card was disabled because of all the previous attempts in such a short time.  So I said, let's try a different card.  Finally, success!
Then my phone rang and it was the Banks fraud department telling me I had been charged twice for the same amount.  What a ball of snakes!!!
It's all good now, but that defective card reader should be replaced.  Oh, and did I forget to mention - the guy in line in front of me had a similar experience.
How are the planets aligned today?</Text>

< Review>
I wanted to purchase a bathroom Fan @Home Depot in Santa Ana Ca on E Edinger st. The product is a Home Networks bathroom fan with a built in speaker priced at $149. I asked a Home Depot Employee by the name of Steven on Sept 7 at about 3:45 pm for some help. It looks. It appears that he was more interested in Walking the aisles with his colleague. I asked him if I needed additional parts or tubing for this product. What a waste of my time and I felt stupid. I won&apos;t be going to that Home Depot anymore. I am on my way to Lowe&apos;s in Tustin< /Review>

Ron in flooring was awesome tonight, he helped me fill my list for a bathroom remodeling. We were almost done with my list and it was nearing the end of his shift, his boss Irma was passing by and authorized him to stay and we finished my order. Great customer service by Ron, putting the customer first.</review>

A great place to buy raw materials for any of your building needs. Generally, Home Depot has lower prices than Lowes (based on my observations and products I was looking for). They also have military parking and military discounts.< /review>

Home Depot in Santa Ana has a number of items I wouldn't have known I needed, had I not wandered about the store completing my list.  For example, I was looking for wooden closet pole hanging cups, and I came upon a door mounted peep hole lense.  I've been waiting to install another one that my 5" 2" can peer through.<//text>

Use the website and find what you need before you go. It gives  Aisle and Bay number an makes it easier to locate item in the store.  By the way this is store specific i.e.  the item may not be in the same Aisle and Bay in every store.<//Text>

Rented a paint Sprayer from this location and didn't work , when I arrived at the job site the machine started leaking everywhere. I had to take apart and clean it in order for it to work, when I told the person in charge about the situation he immediately turned me down and was very rude about the whole thing he wouldn't even look at me in the face and was texting on his phone the entire time. Would never rent from here again</Review>

Are you an inspiring do it yourself-er? Well The Home Depot in Santa Ana is probably the place to go for real DIY for instance if you need lumber to build a shed, come here. Need a screw driver, comer here. They have hard to find hardware and even rare and out dated stuff. Jason the customer service guy working their is really awesome and helped me out. Thanks a lot i really appreciate the service!< /Text>

Your typical Home Depot and the selection of merchandise.  This one used to be the old Delorean Plant.  Some of the employees say there are unexplained sounds in the store at night.  It might be John Delorean's ghost wandering the store.  Anyway, it's a bit larger than your typical Home Depot so it has some extra items the regular store does not.<//Text>

Usually has everything I need in stock. Customer service is hit or miss. The younger team members are friendly but may lack knowledge and the older team members can have an attitude and avoid you at all costs at times.<//Review>

Usually has everything I need in stock. Customer service is hit or miss. The younger team members are friendly but may lack knowledge and the older team members can have an attitude and avoid you at all costs at times.<//Review>

Had what I needed, but finding it took an hour and 4 employees who seemed not to have a clue where anything in the store was. To bad Ace didn't have the aluminum L bar I needed.  Was actually going to get everything I needed from here but cut my losses and got the rest at Ace.</Review>

I've gotten screws or nails in my tires 3 times here! Also I generally wander around lost for 15 minutes until I can find what I'm looking for on my own since there aren't people on the floor that I can ever find.<//Text>

<review>(Translated by Google) Very expensive and it's all made in china
Better buy online by frame
It is also made in China but it is very big, the difference is 3 × 10

Example with warranty

Hose 3 / 4in.dia × 100 ft
home dipot $ 54.98

Hose 3 / 4in.dia × 100ft
Frame 29.99
With spray gun

(Original)
Muy caro y es todo hecho en china
Mejor compro en linea por armazón
es tambien hecho en china pero es bien grande la diferencia es del 3 ×10

Ejemplo con garantia

Mangera 3/4in.dia × 100 ft
home dipot $54.98

Mangera 3/4in.dia × 100ft

(Translated by Google) Huge hardware store.
Large selection of construction products.
As well as agricultural products.
Here you can buy seedlings of vegetable and flower crops. And also seedlings of fruit trees. Lemon seedlings were bought here - everything grows and bears fruit!
Pleases a huge number of diverse flower seedlings. I want to buy literally everything! This time they chose geranium.
Very competent consultants.
Recommend!

(Original)
Огромный хозяйственный магазин.
Большой выбор строительных товаров.
А так же товары для ведения сельского хозяйства.
Здесь можно купить рассаду  овощных и цветочных культур.  А так же саженцы плодово-ягодных деревьев. Покупали здесь саженцы лимона - все растёт и даёт плоды!
Радует огромное количество разнообразной цветочной  рассады. Хочется купить буквально все! В этот раз выбрали герань.
Очень грамотные консультанты.
Рекомендую!< /review>
