Well laid out Planet Fitness location. Everything you expect from this chain of gyms. Equipment in very good shape and plenty of it. Plenty of free weights, Smith machines and benches. Friendly, upbeat staff. Beverages available for purchase.

Plenty of free parking. It is a large lot. Grocery store, restaurants and a variety of other stores in this shopping complex.

Nice area.< /text>

<review>Pretty good for basic workouts and cardio. Machines are in good condition and there are standard plates and dumbbells available. Not the best place if you're into lifting heavy but great for lighter days. 24 hour access and great price, around $10 a month.</review>< gmap_id>

Love it here. It's clean, there's a ton of machines and weights to work with. People are good about wiping things down when they're done working out. And for $10 a month with no contract, there is no better deal.< /text>

Not pleased at all. They make it a real pain to cancel your membership, when every other membership business makes cancellation a breeze. I no longer live in oceanside and the only way to cancel is in person at a state I don't live in, or to send a freaking certified letter by mail. Just plain bad business. Allow people to cancel their memberships remotely!<//Text>

It's decent. Lots of room, plenty of cardio machines. A good amount of resistance/strength training equipment too. My only gripe is that there is no dedicated bench or squat rack. Sure you can use the smith machines, but do you really want to?
I also noticed that not very many people are wearing masks, so there's that too<//Text>

WATCH OUT WITH THESE PEOPLE!!! They won't accept payment by credit card or check. They insist on direct bank account deductions, AND THEN THEY INCREASE THE AMOUNT WITHOUT YOUR PERMISSION!! And it is hard to cancel with them. They don't play with a full deck. Do not give in to them.<//review>

Truly a judgement free zone where anyone can progress their health and fitness journey.  Sometimes the machines have malfunctions and I'm not a fan of how much paper waste is used, should just offer hand towels.

This place is no gimmicks and only has the necessities. There's tons of cardio equipment, though. It's very reasonably priced and always very clean. I've only been a member for a couple of weeks, but I already like it better than 24 hour fitness and LA Fitness.<//review>

Husband and I have been going for 2 months. Large clean facility. Greeters are happy. Need more air circulation, little stuffy air quality at times. Love free bagels. New equipment, great lockers showers. The trainer was good but didn't show up for 2nd appt.<//Review>

My wife and I are new members.  We recently encountered a serious issue and the manager Chris went above and beyond my expectations to make it right! Chris had an EPIC level of customer service and seemed to genuinely care about the situation. He offered a very fair resolution and because of how well this was handled, we will always be loyal members and I will recommend this place to anyone looking for an awesome gym.
Thank you again CHRIS</text>

I have the black card membership and I have been going to all the other Planet Fitness gyms and this gym has become one of the best ones in my opinion. It has the standing tanning rooms and laying down tanning rooms, all the equipment is pretty basic but atleast all of the equipment can be used to get a basic workout. It also has a locker room and showers. The one thing negative thing about Planet Fitness is the new Company policy which means you cannot have your gym bag in the gym; it must stay in your car or at the locker room. That sucks honestly!< /text>

For the price this is a very nice gym. Staff keeps it very clean at least whenever I am there. The parking lot is another story since it looks at times like the homeless have taken it over. I have not been down there at night but I would be more alert concerning the types that are living in their cars in that lot. That is not Planet Fitness's problem, that is the city's problem for not enforcing their laws concerning urban camping by bums.</Review>

Gym is super clean for being 6 years old. Staff does a great job of keeping it clean and are very welcoming. Its busy in the afternoons Monday through Friday but other than that it has a mellow level of traffic for the size of the gym. Love the pizza night too! They get Big Bobs Best Pizza and you cant pass that up! Overall a great place! Have been going for years and will continue to go.< /Text>

Really like this place.  It's good if you are just wanting to do your own thing for your workout.  Plenty of machines, equipment/gym area cleaned regularly.  If you want personal training or lots of exercise class options, probably looking for a different type of gym</Review>

Simple, easygoing place where you can just go and get your workout in and be done with it. Clean (Except boneheads who can’t read the signs all over the place that state “please wipe down machine after every use”!)

<Rating>3</Rating><review>Staff is always nice and friendly and the club is always clean. Tha being said my issues are with the equipment. They do not have a good variety of machines to get a full workout in. Although i appreciate the new equipment, the new equipment to me was not built very well. The action on some of the new machines is terrible and doesnt feel smooth and full range. The new squat racks are the worst ive ever used. Not smooth and some seem to have unnecessary resistance. For that i am looking to join a new gym.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>{'time': 1569719828440, 'text': "Cory, we're constantly seeking to improve our equipment and would hate to see you go.

Love this gym for convenience (the Sprinter station is across the street, Albeetsons next door), and it's clean and spacious, but it's pretty bare-bones when it comes to classes and amenities. However, the fees are low and that appeals to me also.<//Text>

<Text>I signed up, but when I went sine lazy chick named Amber was there I dont know why they have an anti people person working the front desk. Amber put me aside to help other people enroll when I was already to enroll myself. She wouldn't give me a tour of the place like Crystal told me they would when I spoke to her in the phone. Overall horrible sign up experience.</Text>< Resp>

Lots of options when it comes to working out. They are not like 24 hour fitness... It is more along the lines of general fitness. They have treadmills, bikes and other stationary things.
They have free weights and free WiFi as well.

If you pay for the $20 membership, you get unlimited tanning, hydro beds and massage chairs. Plus you can use your membership at other Planet Fitness places.< /Text>

<Text>This is the dirtiest location I have yet to visit .toilet sensors do not work and u must wait a long time to wash your hands because those sensors don’t work either . The showers do not access hot water nor do they put out enough water pressure so u will take a long shower because it trickles out ! the excuse for the last six months is the plumber does not have the parts ordered yet! This is the same excuse used three months ago when I visited . Again today when other woman mentioned the problem the employee uttered the same excuse .I told her that was the same thing they said months ago . I was then told by the employee “if you don’t like it I can terminate your membership “ I have contacted the main office and put in a request for the manager /owner of this location to get back to me . It’s a health department issue when the plumbing of a business fails for several months putting people safety and health at risk and the only thing the people behind the register had to say is that the manager will not come in until after 10 am there is nothing anyone can nor will do except take people’s money and have them join a broken in unkept gym  . The overall rude inconsiderate service those people provide is embarrassing  but hey the manager does not care either he’s to busy sleeping 😴< /Text><pics>None< /pics><response>{'time': 1542407895947, 'text': "Princess, our goal is to deliver legendary customer service to our members at all times and never want to hear that anyone is feeling this way.

<Review>Lots of machines for cardio, never have a problem finding an open bike or treadmill, but not nearly enough free weights for how busy it is. You either have to wait for people to finish or work on something else. Best time to go is Friday evening, not nearly as busy at that time.<//Review>< Pics>

There's a lite selection of machines that are pretty much in full use early in the morning and late in the evening. Best time to go is from 10-2, or from midnight to 5 in the morning.</review>

<review>I would consider this a good gym, but nothing fantastic. I'm not a fan of gyms or working out in front of other people in general, but this place gets the job done, and you can't beat the $10 per month fee. They have a lot of cardio equipment, which is most of the reason why I go there. I generally only go during the low time of the day, between 1:00pm to 3:00pm to avoid the crowds. I've been at night, and you basically spend more time bumping elbows with strangers and waiting for equipment to open up than actually working out. I get very irritated by the number of people who aren't serious about working out. There's always people babysitting the machines; just sitting there on their phones and not lifting a single muscle, or people who think the gym is a social place. I really wish the staff would be more attentive to that and say something to the lazy people. I suppose that's just the sort of people these less expensive gyms attract. I'm also a little disappointed that there aren't any real classes. You can sign up for small group lessons where you focus on a certain body part, but I already know how to do that, or I could watch a YouTube video for ideas. If I could afford a gym that teaches yoga, self-defense, or a sport, I'd go there instead. Still, if you're just looking for an inexpensive place to lift weights and do some cardio, then Planet Fitness is your place.</review>< Pics>

I have been to other fitness centers where it's dusty, dirty and workout equipment is always breaking down but that didn't happen at planet fitness. The only disappointment I have with them is....
I've moved to Hawaii and they are not out here... Okay you've got to get your act together and move your facility to Hawaii, I would jump at the chance to be a member again (please please please)

<review>This location is a dump. STAY AWAY!!! WORST LOCATION EVER! The management sucks! Poor maintenance on equipment. I reported broken pieces of equipment 8 months ago and they are still not repaired. There is never any toilet paper in the toilet stalls. Most often there is urine all over the floor and toilet seats. Showers are moldy broken/missing soap holders. The locker rooms get nasty at times. There is never any staff to clean the mens locker room. They hired a female mostly staff and they don't want to go into the mens locker room to clean. This is NOT a problem at other locations where female staff announce they are cleaning and go in.</review>< Pictures>

It's alright. I see a lot of members babysitting weights though. It's pretty annoying. Plus a lot of people sit on machines and play with their phones or socialize like its some kind of place to hang out. I'm not a fan of people that aren't at the gym to do work. Nice place though. Wish they had more free weights.< /text>

<Date>1403552349051< /Date><review>I had chosen Planet Fitness over other gyms because a friend works out there. I went in thinking I could check it out, maybe work out for a day to get a feel for the gym. Wrong, they wanted $20 for me to try out their gym, the cost of a day pass. I understood that the $20 would go towards my membership fees if I had chosen to join. For $9 more, a total of $29 I could just join and call it a day. So I did, worst thing I could have done! The front desk staff was rude, took my payment information but didn't even finish my application process. I had to come back and finish it, yet they had already charged my account and by this time I had YET TO WORK OUT! I was bothered by the rude staff and their horrible customer service. But I thought, for $10 a month maybe it won't be so bad after all and decided to go ahead and give it a try. Let me also add that they just gave me a "welcome bag" and as far as I know that was their only introduction to their gym I never got a tour, absolutely nothing. Needless to say I was ready to give up on their gym right after I had just joined. 3 out of 5 of their step masters were always out of service, the facility is dirty considering they expect everyone to clean up after themselves, just over all a horrible experience. I was ready to cancel less than a month after I had joined. I tried calling in to let them know and as you can see on their website, you have to go in and cancel. Okay, so I was finally able to go during one of my lunch breaks. Since their night staff was so horrible I figured I could go during the day and speak to a manager. I told him about how horrible I thought their gym was. He informed me I couldn't get my $29.99 "sign up fee" back and that I was three days too late to cancel for the following month. He did nothing for me except leave me with an even bitter taste in my mouth. Go else where. This place is sooooooo not worth it!< /review></record>

I'm  not a fitness guy. I'm  the kind of guy that trains to perform better in the sport that he loves and also an international student. This gym has been so far perfect for me. The staff is great  and friendly they are cool for sure. All the facilities are clean and organized. Although, it is a groing up franchise, but  10$ the month. C'mon Let's  go!< /Review>

<Text>This place has very poor equipment maintenance. I've complained 2x over a 2 year period over the vinyl plastic cushions being torn on the bicep curl machines and each instance it took them longer than 6 months to fix them!! The owner is a complete idiot managing this business. I've gone to fitness 19 in Oceanside and each month they had maintenance people come in take the machines apart and refurbish them to new condition. The customer service is VERY poor at this planet fitness gym in Oceanside.< /Text><Date>1491500364262</Date><Rating>1</Rating><resp>None<//resp></record></dataset><record>

Been paying them for 2 seperate accounts for two years and never step foot into the gym. Canceled my accounts  which they said and theyre should not have been any buy outs. But low and behold another $39 for each account withdrawn from my checking. I get so tired of disputing everything with all these scam artists in the world.why should I have to go through this. Tired of the bullshit.< /text>

I have been going to planet fitness for 1 month now, i love it,  almost all of the staff is great fun outgoing happy and fun to talk to, except for 3 of them.My friend and i usually go there like at 7 to 8pm maybe 8:30pm and there 2 to 3 times a week we see 3 staff members, they do not talk to anyone, smile. or seem to want to interact with clients, my friend has a loud voice her and me were having a conversation and one of the staff (lady with longgg black curly hair),went up us and said can u pls be quiet, u r disturbing people, we were shocked , since we had been going there for 2 weeks and she was the first staff member out of MANYYY  to ever say anything to us, we looked around and only saw 6 people working out half of them on their ipods,, O.o, so we let this pass and became quiet ,now weeks after, today december 22 2012, my friend was watching football on tv and shes all into the game and being loud saying COME on yay wow good job, and the (long hair lady) sent one of the other staff to tell her to be quiet,that was the tip of the ice berg, since there were only 3 people at the gym and no one was paying attention to her since they were all making funny facces because they were sore from working out, so then me and my friend said ,well you (lady in black hair) are the only staff member who tells us to be quiet, no other staff members in other days ever tells us or any other loud person anything, they all know us and talk to us and are friendly and like us, you and your other 2 friends are the only ones who tells us to b quiet,we tell her  no one is here, she says i know no one is here, thats why i come work at this time, its empty, that basically let me and my friend know this (lady in long black hair) does not like people and does no like loud noises,and it kinda explains it when you look at how she doesnt like to be friendly with members. Basically , she ruined our workout,does not like us, and because of her and her other 2 friends, we are not and do not recommend , going to planet fitness late at night, i would hate for other people to go through this, we are not mean people we do not want trouble, this lady just doesnt like loud sounds, and is the only  one who complaints about it.
PLANET FITNESS IS A NO JUDMENT ZONE AND THIS LADY JUDGES MY FRIEND ON HER VOICE, o.O ,THERES OTHER STINKY,SWEATY PEOPLE, WHO SH DOESNT TELL ANYTHING TO o.O

THE MANAGER HAS BEEN THERE AND WE HAVE BEEN THE SAME AN  HAVE ACTED THE SAME WAY WE ACTED TODAY, SHE LIKES US, WE TALK TO HER, AND SHE NEVER TOLD US ANYTHING, WHAT SHE DID DO, WAS PUT THE STAFF WHO DOES NOT DOO ANYTHING ALL DAY, TO CLEAN THE MACHINES AND WAS TELLING OTHERS WHAT THEY (SHOULD) BE DOING.

FOR GODS SACK EVEN THE JANITOR, LIKES TALKING TO US ,AND GOES UP TO US WHENEVER WE TAKE A BREAK AND ASKS US ,HOW WE ARE DOING, WHATS GOING ON, HOW IS YOUR WORKOUT GOING.<//review>

I had a great experience living at Solamonte for 2 years. The management and maintenance both are great. The BEST thing was that they were really great and considerate when I was moving in and moving out. My apartment wasn't ready on the date of move-in but my movers had arrived with my stuff and Solamonte made arrangement for move-in on the same day. Upon move out, there were few charges that I disagreed with and discussed with them and they happily removed from the bill. Very responsive people especially Adam. He would always smile while giving you your packages (They later installed electronic package system which is cool. You'd get email or text msg and could retrieve packages on your own!). The ONLY CONCERN I had was that during renovation, the clubhouse was closed for a long time and the rent wasn't adjusted accordingly. They allowed the residents to use amenities at their other properties which was good but overall such long renovation was little inconvenient. Regardless, the people, management, maintenance, location, quality of life there, everything was wonderful. They communicate really well and you'll often have flyers on your doors to share information with you. My apartment was spacious, neighbors were awesome, and I would definitely recommend this property to anyone. Short drive from Ontario Airport as well. Don't forget to check out many beautiful parks nearby!< /text>

Don’t move here if you have more than one car.
Their accounting department isn’t great
Besides that , nice apartments

They recently are working on the parking issue and it seems to be improved!! 2 to 5 stars!!<//text>

We live here 5 years! Love this place!
Managers and Maintenance are the best!
Barbara and Adam are soooo kind and always helpful!ALWAYS! Each request is being resolved very quick!!
Carlos is very friendly , always smiles and does his work very well! He is like your uncle from afar, even if you sad or tired, he will make you smile)) 👍
I'm confused why Solamonte has such a low rating.
For sure buildings have some issues, but be realistic, it cannot be avoided at any commercial leaving property.
Sad that some reviews are about rude managers. THIS IS NOT TRUE! Not at this place!
People, just remember that what you give out, you get back)
Solamonte is our home 🏡<//Text>

<Review>I’ve lived at Solamonte for almost a year now and I LOVE the apartments. They are BEAUTIFUL, both inside the units and the community. Living in an apartment will have its issues here and there but there maintenance is so fast at responding..it’s almost always the same day and the issue is fixed, no 3 day wait even if it isn’t an emergency. Carlos is the BEST! He really makes relationships with the tenants to make you feel like he is there for any issues and he will fix them until your happy! He is professional with a great attitude and I appreciate that. Love the apartments and the staff.<//Review><user_id>117425943769192487033<//user_id><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<review>Been here for almost 4 years. The complex was good before but has seen improvements since it transferred owners about 2 years ago. They updated the club room and included new amenities for the residents, to name a couple examples.

The staff have been very helpful as well, some days they seem flustered but, overall, they keep a professional, inviting attitude. The on-site maintenance crew are the best...kind, responsive, and courteous. Carlos with the maintenance crew always has a good attitude and is always willing to help.

My only negative comment is the consistent rate increase, I have seen an increase in my rent totalling $300 since I began living here.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><user_id>113797874107138825563<//user_id><Response>{'time': 1574099733849, 'text': 'Thank you Jacob! we truly appreciate you taking the time to share your experience and are happy to have you as part of our community at Solamonte.

The maintenance guys here are the best! They  promise that anything that needs to be fixed will be taken care of within 2 days, but my experience is that it is more like 2 hours. The on-line maintenance request is easy to use. And Carlos and the whole maintenance team work hard to keep the place in the best possible shape.  The office staff are great too. The construction is finished now and the amenities are all new and fabulous.< /text>

Two days ago my car was stolen. That is after my car was broken into a couple of months ago and my apartment broken into about a year ago. Management offered no simblance of compassion and only told me I would need to pay for a new fob and remote clicker. They did not tell other tenants of the theft and ask for any witnesses and only told me I wasnt the first one and there was a lot of crime in the area. Very poor management and no real security. The gate is often broken.<//text>

I just have to say that every time I walk into the office at Solamonte, it ends up being a pleasant experience. The management never brushes me off when I have a question or concern and they all actually seem like they are genuinely interested in how they can help or accommodate me. The community manager Britni has always gone above and beyond to make sure that I am happy and satisfied. I've had several great experiences with this staff here. Oh and btw...my apartment is incredible!!< /review>

Extremely disappointed with the customer service at the front desk they are so rude I am very appalled!

It’s very upsetting paying this much rent to be treated in such a way especially when things are falling apart.

Hopefully they can train these people to treat paying tenants much better in the future so they can get positive feedback referrals for further business.

Customer service is key!

Thank you!< /review>

TLDR Version: Apartments are great, staff is friendly, quick maintenance response, dog friendly.  Love living here.

I've lived at Solamonte for almost 5 months now and have no major complaints. We were warned that they would be going under a major remodel before we moved in so we haven't been able to use any amenities yet.

Pros:
- Excellent Staff: Friendly, Answer e-mails generally within 24 hours, or I can walk in during business hours to the leasing office.
- Quiet Area: Neighbors are usually pretty quiet. Kids do run around on occasion.
-Maintenance Requests are easy to submit and responded to quickly: You can submit a request online easily and is fixed within a day or two.
-Animal friendly: I had a hard time finding a place that would allow me to have my Husky and Solamonte doesn't restrict Huskies.
-W/D Hookup IN Unit: Speaks for itself.
-Nice area: Nice backdrop of mountain when going for walks or you can get an apartment with a view ( additional cost to rent ).
-Valet trash pickup: Just put trash outside your door at designated times and someone picks it up ( added to rent costs ).
-Security Patrol: Patrol at night and it's a gated community, although the gate is easy to get through if you follow someone in.

Cons:
Construction: Was quoted for a 2 months time table period and we're on month 3. Been here almost 5 months without having been able to use amenities.
Package pickup: Any mail delivered goes to leasing office so you have to make it to the leasing office before they close to get packages delivered BUT the remodel is supposed to provide us with our own package holding boxes so we won't have to do this anymore.
Dog Poop: A lot of pet owners are lazy and don't pick up their dogs poop, the staff have sent out e-mails and letters about it to try and help promote poo pickup. At least there are sprinklers everywhere to help with clearing up dog pee.
Price: Is a little steep but better than most places I compared.<//Text>

< review>
I have lived here for a little over a month and I have been very pleased with my experience. The staff went above and beyond to help me make my decision about moving to the area from the East Coast and they were so patient with me when I called asking some of the most ridiculous questions (God Bless Ashia)! I also had some very tedious maintenance requests that were done within 24-Hours and done with a good spirit! It is always nice to interact with people who seem like they actually like their job and Solamonte's staff seems to always be in good spirits.</review>

I lived at these apartments for almost 4 years, and I never had any major issues. The neighborhood stayed mostly quiet (aside from the occasional loudly shut door), and the grounds were well-kept. The staff was always welcoming and willing to help (especially Britni!). Would definitely recommend to just about anybody. Thanks for the last four years, AMLI/Solamonte.</Text>

During my stay here I had to have them come out like 4 times to fix the AC, twice to fix the second bathroom toilet and my garage was broken into. On one of the AC and both of the Toilet fixes the tech all but told me I didn't know what I was talking about and came by for 5 minutes and said it was working fine and nothing needed to be fixed. They ignored special instructions like call before you come and rarely replied to service requests sent through Email. If your expecting to go to the office good luck chances are they are closed on some random day or closed for lunch for 3 hours. As for the apartment itself for what you get they are extremely overpriced. They are priced at a luxury apartment price but have none of the luxury apartment features. Then when you move out don't be surprised but you will probably lose your deposit and have additional charges for some outlandish reason. I read a few reviews saying this but didn't believe them but sure enough they were true. A month after I moved out I got a letter stating I owed $156. When I called to dispute they told me I had put holes in the counter tops I used twice and they had to be painted which cost $220. Then before I left I paid $250 to have the place professionally cleaned everything except the carpets which they told me they would clean and I wouldn't be charges. Low and behold a month after they are saying all the carpets had to be replaced. Single guy that works 15 hour days how much damage could I really have done. Then to top it off out of the blue they tacked on another $150 for Utilities (Garbage, Sewer, Etc) which is supposed to be included in rent. Please do not rent from these people. There is a reason there are almost as many 1 stars reviews as 5 stars. They do not do honest business.< /review>

Upon our residents vacating their apartments, we do have the carpets professionally cleaned and it is no charge to anyone.

Utilities do take 2 months to go through the first cycle before residents have to pay, so utilities are 2 months behind at move out – that will automatically be taken out of the security deposit.

Pricey but worth the peace and quiet. Grounds are clean. No vandalism. I'm very happy there. My one and only complaint; THEY NEVER ANSWER THEIR PHONES.

<Text>Do not believe the hype and the reviews that say this is a good place because it is not! Total LEMON complex and management/maintenance sucks! Can never do their job right and they have the pool under construction during the summer time when kids are out of school-how dumb can you be ? I pay rent for the amenities that includes access to the gym & pool also but havent been able to use either going on 4 months now but I they still collecting a ridiculous amount of money on time each month without being willing to pro rate the rent due to their selfishness. NO PARK 4 KIDS BUT BUILDING A DOG PARK-REALLY!

Amli at Empire Lakes used to be a great place to live. However, your recent move-ins have changed this to party central. The pool area has drinking and loud music until all hours of the evening. And just tonight (7/12) there are competing parties going on, one in an apartment patio in building 4 and one at the pool area. I know that you do not provide security, as stated by your office staff but this is ridiculous. I guess if I have to become a cop caller as suggested by your office staff I will, I am done putting up with this. I only have 6 more weeks in what I refer to as Hell.

Those of us who are working individuals do not appreciate being kept up late at night or having obnoxious music screamed into our apartments. For the amount of rent we pay we should be able to enjoy our apartments.

On another note, I thought alcohol and smoking was against the rules in the pool area.......you might want to enforce this.<//review>

We appreciate any feedback that our residents give us especially if they are unhappy with their current living situation.  We apologize that other residents have ruined this for you.  Anyone else living in close proximity probably experienced the same behavior.  Our office staff is looking into a standing guard to monitor the pool area after hours to better enforce policies.  We are also looking into a new security service to provide the same level of service that the standing guard would have.  Smoking and alcohol are not permitted in the pool area & our office staff just sent an email to all residents about the pool policy.  We do try our best to implement those policies.  Again, thank you for bringing these issues to our attention.  Please feel free to contact our staff with any other concerns that you may have.'}<//resp>

My door knob broke, my restroom towel rack broke and we never even used it. i left the apartment spotless when i left so i cant wait to see what they will charge me for i definitely will be going to small claims if any miscellaneous charges are added . DO NOT LIVE HERE! I PAID OVER $ 2,500.00 A MONTH FOR A 3 BEDROOM 2 BATH AND HAD ALL THESE HORRIBLE THINGS HAPPEN!

<Text>EDIT 10/28/15: New move ins not have the whole building smelling like weed everyday after 5pm. One car has been parked for over 5 months and another for over 3. The management only acts upon these problems when the actual owners of amli come by. Many breaks in have been happening. Overpriced and not the place for us. We are attempting to break the lease early.

OLD POST:This place is pretty expensive compared to other apartments. I think the buildings are built to good quality and good flow. Our 2 bedroom apartment feels roomy. But the rest is more then the cost of a house in the area. There's is only one trash can on the north side of the apartments. Parking is impossible. I pay for an expensive 2 bedroom apartment and only get a 1 car garage. I asked to pay for an extra outside spot and was turned down. 3 nights in a row I have to park outside of the apartments far from my apartment. 2 cars have not moved in 2 months. Contacting the office is useless. They use excuses instead of producing results. Why not enforce parking permits? If you purchase a 1 bedroom you get 1 pass. 2 bedroom 2 passes this would help save spots from the countless cars parked in one spot for months. Been here 6 months and ready to leave mostly due to the parking.<//Text>< Pics>

{'time': 1422402546509, 'text': "Hello Kyle,\nWe understand your frustration with the parking situation.  At 97% occupancy, the  parking spaces have become non-existent,  It is unfortunate that we were not able to include additional parking spaces when AMLI obtained Empire Lakes.  The limited parking spaces and one trash bin was decided by the City of Rancho Cucamonga and was out of our control.  If we were able to incorporate an additonal trash bin at the property, that would take away from additional parking spaces.  We would love to be able to accomodate our residents with more spaces.  We also agree that if you have a 2 bedroom apartment, that you should receive 2 parking spaces.  Thank you for bringing up the issue with cars that haven't moved in a couple months.  We are working with our towing company to have cars removed if they have been stored in spot for any length of time, expired tags, etc.\nWe don't want to loose you as a resident.  Have a good day.\nThe AMLI team"}< /response>

<Review>I originally was very pleased there first couple months living at AMLI. I even bought a gift basket for the leasing staff at Christmas in appreciation! Honestly, the first 6 months, I felt the staff was very responsive but the last few months, I found it very difficult to get through to the front desk over the phone. When you call the toll-free number, they refer you back to the local office. The corporate office also doesn't answer or reply to calls. It's best to go in person however even scheduling in-person appointments doesn't work with AMLI. I scheduled 2 separate appointments for walk-throughs at the end of my lease and both times I was stood up (I left work early 2 different days during 2 consecutive weeks).

The pet stations are often out of plastic bags and overflowing with trash and pet waste. During Easter weekend, there was a dead rat floating in the pool. The spa was out if order from November through May. It's frustrating because you pay for amenities that are not maintained. The traffic on Milliken and along 6th is very loud at all hours... day and night.

If you want to live somewhere that is well maintained, clean, safe, and has okay management, you should live ANYWHERE but here. If you would like responsive management, live ANYWHERE but here. It is my understanding they are going under new ownership and the staff doesn't give a squat which explains why my experience changed so drastically during the year I was there.

I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS...If you are looking for a place to live, for the price, you can live at your choice of several complexes nearby. Choose another place. The leasing staff is unresponsive, the property is not well maintained (pet stations overflowing with trash and pet waste, spa was broken more than half time I lived at the complex, dumpster area is disgusting!). You don't want to get stuck here like I did for the year I had my lease.</Review><resp>{'time': 1409078701105, 'text': "Hi Sarah,\n\nI'm sorry you have decided to move out, and I apologize that we did not meet your expectations on pricing and responses.

Don't even consider living here, I had the Worst experience here.

They will treat you like a king before you sign the lease and worse than an untouchable after you do. You will be nickel and dimed to death, trust me...they will squeeze every penny out of you.
I have lived here for 3 unhappy years and you will not beleive how many charges they piled up on me stating as move out charges and when I asked them about those charges they couldn't be any more arrogant and rude.

Cons:

Very Rude office staff and not helpful at all (Especially Haley Flower).
No Customer service after you move in (They will not pick up the phone or answer your calls).
Parking spaces are so limited, you will have a nightmare trying to find one.
Only 1 garbage can for the entire complex, this is a huge inconvenience as I had put the trash in my car and dump it at my office everyday.

My advice: Run...simply run, don't even waste your time on these apartments, they are so many other apartments nearby that are less expensive than AMLI and are well maintained with staff much better than Amli.<//text>

<Review>I have eaten here before and the food was decent, not the best Indian food I have had but by far not the worst. Decent prices and portion sizes. However this time around, my experience was much worse. The food was scheduled for pick up at 1:00pm, and the restaurant did not confirm my order until 2:15pm. I understand that they were busy, but I did not know whether or not my order was received. When I went to pick the order up, the employee said that my order was canceled by Door Dash (it was not), even though I had received a message from Door Dash that the order was ready for pick up. After leaving without my order, and after a pretty rude encounter with the worker, I contacted Door Dash to ask why the order was canceled, upon which they said it was not. Ultimately, I did not get a refund from the restaurant, and was on the phone with Door Dash for 45 minutes trying to resolve the issue. My order was finally refunded, and it was determined that Naan Stop had canceled my order without telling me. Overall a very bad customer service experience, and will not be returning.< /Review>< Pictures>

Absolutely love the guy who works here!!! I would argue that this is the best spot in IV. The first time that I went, I had a great convo with the boss (I’m guessing he is?) and he kept giving me and my friends samples and big portions of food. Came back again today to buy some boba for my roommate that graduated. We had a good conversation and have gave us two free bowls as a congratulations!! Support this business as much as possible! The thai tea boba is amazing and his food is the first authentic Indian food I’ve ever had! :) Thank you! <3<//Review>

<review>Their Naan Stop and Sorbet is amazing! My kids loved the teddy bears & I got the piggies. Next time we're getting the bunnies and chickens in a cup! So cute, we'll be going back soon. Oh, they will also do a dog (cup only) and Pikachu.<//review>< Pictures>

<text>The food tastes like home... if my parents were Indian. They toast the naan on the spot for you. The cheese naan I got had melty cheese inside. The chicken tikka masala and the coconut sauce were great.< /text>< Pics>

The Chicken Masala was fantastic, and paired great with their garlic naan. My opinion is a bit biased because I love Indian food, but overall a very charming little restaurant.

Sami is usually running the register and is a very warm guy. His suggestions are fantastic if you don't know what you want.<//text>

<Review>Great place all around. Sort of a hidden gem in IV. Their garlic naan is the best. The owners are great as well, very friendly people and great service. Just had a sample of their green tea smoothie/milkshake and will definitely be back to get one. Don't be afraid to try the food too, you can sometimes get a small sample to try first and everything I've gotten has been good (:</Review><date>1588305704489</date>< userid>

Great food, great service. Can here during quarantine. Though I didn’t ask, the guy gave me a sample of every dish they had so I know which one I liked. I usually don’t eat Indian food but this one I do.<//Review>

Best boba in IV and amazing food for the price! The owners and staff in general are definitely the friendliest in the area as well. Makes me feel welcome every time I go there for a bite!< /Text>

Definitely among the upper tier of inexpensive counter-serve Indian places I've come across. Tasty and well-prepared. I was especially impressed by the roti. A lot of Indian places I've been to have terrible, dry roti. The roti here is moist, tender and has a pleasant chew.< /Review>

I ordered the chicken tikka masala rice bowl. It wasn't creamy or sweet enough, but it was a good deal for the price. They also sell boba tea here, although I didn't try it. The naan was too oily. Unfortunately, this is the only Indian restaurant nearby.</review>

Love Naan Stop, an old favorite. I used to come here all the time when I was younger. Had an opportunity to pick some up today for the first time in a very long time, and I must say that it is just as good as I remember. And now I feel like I have been neglecting this IV gem. One of the last of the old, long running restaurants. I truly hope that the gentrification of Isla Vista won't make Naan Stop go.  I have loved every dish I've tried here.< /text>

I used to love this place. Recently they changed their prices so that, instead of getting a better deal on larger orders, large to go containers cost disproportionately more than their smaller counterparts.

8oz Chicken is 5.75
12oz Chicken is 9.75
The difference in volume is 150%
The difference in price is 170%
Then they charge an extra dollar if you want Chicken Tikka Masala!

They clearly changed their pricing to a more predatory model to take advantage of drunk college students. This is a sad cash grab from a great restaurant. I cannot recommend this place anymore. If you want to get a delicious Indian feast, go to Masala Spice.</review>

The hospitality here was great when we went. The food had naan stop flavor! So delicious and affordable. Great spot for vegitarians as it has many options to pick from so that you can enjoy your meal now and still come back later to try other new options and combinations. They provided samples and helpful information in case one has allergies or preference. I highly recommend trying this place. I look forward to coming back and trying more of their foods.<//review>

One of the best Indian restaurant in town! Great selection  of  chicken plates for all kind of customers,  those you love spicy food, or  those you prefer mild.   The naan  bread was delicious and fresh made. We tried the garlic one , and we loved it. Naan Stop will definitely be our favorite  place to eat Indian food.</Text>

We ordered 3 different entree which cost us $50. When we got it, it didn't come with rice or anything. I called the restaurant 3 times asking them why I didn't get rice and the guy rudely said that's just how it is and hung up on me. The lamb was over cooked and it tasted as if it was previously frozen and heated as if it's newly cooked. I absolutely question all the good reviews here. Giving this place 1 star is VERY generous.< /text>

This service come really fast so they can serve you with food constantly and get you in and out. I think this is predominantly a Gujarati based Thali, so you can expect A lot of the curries & dals to be sweet.<//Review>

one of my favorite places to eat in iv. the rice bowl and a la carte options are two of the most cost effective ways to fill up your tummy in this teenage wasteland. water is free, a number of sauces are provided. the garlic naan is tight, Samosas  are noteworthy,  and a number of vegetarian options are offered. my girlfriend and I enjoy this fine establishment and frequent it's premises.</Review>

Both hubby and I got a plate dinner :consisted of 1 chicken & 1 vegetable + rice  for $9.95 ,enough to feed you. We chose the popular chicken dish and the "creme spinach/tofu -both tasty with true Indian flavors.

I had an almond milk tea, sweet, very almond flavor, I like it and could have Boba too added, if you wanted. It seem too sweet for hubby and daughter.

The sweet cheese ball dessert was ok, I had better but could be, it was late in the day, seem overly soggy.< /Review>

It's not expensive and it's suuuuper good. The basic bowl with rice and chicken and any naan variation will make you feel super full even if you are not done yet.< /text>

<resp>None<//resp><Time>1551077768808<//Time><Text>Think Panda Express, but for Indian food.  They have trays of pre-made food and serve straight from them.   It's not gourmet, but I think it tastes pretty good, and it's not absurdly expensive!   I like the chicken tikka masala, but the veggie options are good, too!  If you don't mind paying an extra couple dollars, I'd recommend also getting either a samosa or warm naan.

A word of caution.  There are several menus in the store, so it's a little confusing to order.  I (and the people working there) recommend you just pick something from the blackboard next to the food trays.  I always just get a rice bowl.  Simple and cheaper than most other options!

Something I don't like about this place is the use of plastic and styrofoam bowls and utensils.  Something to keep in mind if you're bothered by using disposable things.</Text><rating>4<//rating>< Gmap_id>

<Review>A fast food version of the standard Indian lunch buffets, you can order complicated meals, or more commonly you can grab a 1 item bowl or 2 item plate. All the standards are here, Chicken Tikka Masala, Vegetable Korma, Chicken Vindaloo, Chana Masala, Saag Paneer, etc. They do variaties of naan that are good and fresh, and the owner who frequently works the register is very nice.
You can eat in, they have a sauce stand for the mint chutney, etc you may want, and some cramped seating for those stopping in for a quick lunch. There's a small shared parking lot as well, making it convenient for lunch even if you have to drive in from outside Isla Vista. Alternatively they do take out, providing separate sauce and rice containers to make it easier to transport, and have both GrubHub and DoorDash.
The prices are very good, it's slightly on the less expensive side for a lunch in the IV area.< /Review><Resp>None</Resp><user_id>109605449616617302353<//user_id><pics>None<//pics>< Rating>

<Review>People will complain this place isn’t authentic. It’s not perhaps, but we’re not in India and it tastes great regardless. If you like your food less spicy you’ll be happy here. Their daal makhani and chicken tikka masala are my faves.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

<rating>5<//rating><text>My go-to Indian place, setup as a student buffet. Be sure to check out the larger menu, can get custom curries, samosa, dahls, etc. Buffet is inexpensive, full menu a bit pricier, but worth it. Small dining space, but happy takeout. Beware driving in IV as students wander streets as if cluless to vehicles, especially watch out for random foolish bicycles expecting world to watch out for blind entrance on busy streets.< /text>< response>

They use only styrofoam containers to serve all their food in, even if you eat it there. This concerns me because it is so much plastic waste that is not recyclable and harms our local ocean and wildlife. I would consider going there if they changed their containers and eating ware. Please change your styrofoam! Something that is bioregradable,  environmentally friendly or reusable!</review>

Best Boba in Santa Barbara. You are lured in by the aromatic curries and the warm Indian food sitting in a warm display case. Surprisingly extensive menu for such a small place. The drinks have the best value and quality in the area.<//Text>

<Review>Fun pun alert! This place is awesome. If you're looking for something warm and cozy, vegetable korma and daal makhne are where it's at. Chicken tikka also great. If he's got lamb that going that day, you're welcome. The owner dude who is always up front is super rad too. He is always saying 'no regrets' ....you're darn right ;) Treat yourself and get a side of bread. It's so hot and just makes everything better.</Review>< Pics>

When you walk in, stay to the right; this is where you will find the menu on the wall and order.  I see people walking up to the register and trying to order, the setup isn't 100% intuitive but that's fine. To be honest, I did the same thing, but I figured it out while waiting for the register guy to ring someone else up. The customer service was good. I chatted briefly with the dude at the register. The two people running the front seemed nice.

I ordered food from here a few days ago. It was amazing. It reminded me of another Indian food place in Los Angeles. Imo the place is a two $$, but for this area it's a single $. After being deprived of food for so long, this really filled me up nicely.

The Earl Grey boba is not worth getting though; it's a real shame because Earl Grey done right can be a really outstanding choice for milk tea boba. The boba was cooked correctly, it wasn't raw nor was it overly soft and falling apart in the straw.

The biggest bonus I would give this place is that they have a cute girl working there ^_^ (They would get 4 stars regardless of her being there or not)< /review>

Small room and not that much of a selection but the food is the best ever since Taja Malha and Indian Club closed. I absolutely love the Chicken Tikka Masala. The milk tea is also the best by far that I've ever tasted around here. It's not overly sweet like the other places that I've been to which is nice. It's also quite affordable which is a major bonus since I love Indian.</text>

<Review>The food quality has improved exponentially, ever since India Club (same owner) in Goleta closed down and the staff (along with the Chef) moved to Naan Stop. Great Tikka Masala, Dal Makhani and Saag Paneer. A la Carte is a bit more expensive than to-go-buffet, as expected, but is worth the cost.< /Review>< GmapID>

This is my go-to for Indian food. I wouldn't call it amazing, but it's very tasty, pretty fast, and SO cheap. I always get the chicken tikka masala with plain naan and rice. Don't forget to try out their sauces! The green sauce is really tasty: mint and cilantro team up for amazingness.<//Text>

<review>This place is always crowded with people. Their food is mild for people,like Indian spicy stuff but few of their options never disappoint me. Saag paneer and Panner tikka is always good. Chole bhature if also a good option.<//review></record></dataset><record>

Decent tasting Indian food
Somewhat pricey, but that's normal for IV
Usually very fast
Lots of vegetarian and some vegan options
Mediocre customer service< /Review>

Let me just say in response to those who say naan stop has bad service, in a place where most restaurants seem to have trouble getting there food to keep from spilling on arrival naan stop excels in packaging stuff tightly enough to where you could drop it and probably be fine.<//review>

The empanadas are amazing, and the service is even better. I haven't tried the rest of their menu, but please support this business, I'm sure it worth your time. Being a part time delivery driver, they treat us dasher with respect, no thumbing their nose at you.< /review>

<text>One star for the empanadas, they are delicious but pretty expensive. I tried the mix ceviche, seafood taste old with lots of lemon but flavor far from Peruvian style, again too expensive for the portion ( appetizer size)Also, I order the lomo saltado, expensive, salty, nothing out or the ordinary. In conclusion, I will not go back even for the empanadas</text><Gmap_id>0x80857df82fd6f4fb:0x62e0f7fab6915c55<//Gmap_id>< date>

LOVE IT!
I'm Peruvian and have been living in the bay for a few years now, I've been to multiple Peruvian restaurants around the bay and none of them really took me back to Peru until I found Mistura. This restaurant is amazing! I have been ordering mamy times now and I have been in love all those times. Their food is on spot! Their plates have a good price, look great and have the best taste. And last but not least the service, they are very kind and very helpful. If you are looking for authentic Peruvian food this is your place.<//text>

Mistura has easily overtaken other restaurants to become our favorite Peruvian cuisine in the area. Not only do they serve delicious food that's authentic, but it's at a reasonable price and their service is fantastic! Definitely a great restaurant to check out more than once for all of their different options.</Review>

<rate>5</rate><text>Delicious food, friendly service, and the beverage that is made with limes, pineapple, and purple corn is simply 🤯.

I had the rotisserie chicken, which was bomb, but the star is this dish I found to be the sauce that they coated my roasted vegetable side with. It was about on that “to die for” level.

The gf had the pollo saltado and she was a fan of the chicken, lightly fried fries, and THE SAUCE.

Would certainly recommend when you need your Peruvian fix. Irene (our server) was awesome! Can’t wait to go back next time I’m in Piedmont.</text><Name>Tyler Mihalo</Name></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Great Peruvian rotisserie chicken! Just as good as Límon in SF. For $17, you can get half a chicken with two sides and an array of sauces. This is enough to feed 2 depending on how hungry you are. If you want a whole chicken, it’s $26. The sauces are so good and take the chicken to the next level. Make sure to ask for the hot sauce!</Text><Name>Joseph Le< /Name>< rating>

Well-executed and made with care. I personally have a thing for paper thin red onions - and these are dressed in lime juice. A perfect counter point to the lamb and beans. Mistura's rotisserie chicken is also a solid choice. Loved the plantains. Next, I want to try one of the empanadas,  or the chicken in walnut curry sauce, or their lomo saltado a beef dish. Irene is welcoming, warm and genuine. For reasonably priced, well-made food check Mistura out.< /Text>

Loom salgado was overcooked,  And they won't substitute the rice and French fries that come with it for one of their healthier sides. My friend got the chicken and that was quite good,  It had a nice spice rub, and was cooked well. The whole place smelled like Greece and left your clothes smelling that way as well.< /review>

Always an excellent neighborhood gem!  Mistura serves excellent food without pretentiousness... very straight forward and very very yummy!  Their signature roasted chicken is out of this world, but lately I discovered their Aji Gallina, which is like a Peruvian curry... it's awesome!  I recommend to add the vegetables to any dish you get and for starters, the fried yucca!  The owners are usually at the location... introduce yourselves!  They are very friendly and love to hear from their customers.< /Review>

< Review>
We came on a Monday afternoon right before they close at 2:30 and I walked and made sure it was fine for us to still come in and have lunch.

The hostess/waitress was very friendly and welcoming that she told us "sure come'on in".

We knew what we wanted and placed our orders. The food arrived within 15 minutes and was very delicious.

Irena kept checking on us for redills on beverages and if we needed anything else.

This will be our to go spot.</Review>

This was my first time here and I gotta say it was great! It opened at 5:30pm. The half chicken was delicious. The drinks were great too!
The set up is very cool, Nazca lines!!!
Price is mildly higher, but the food balances that out.
Staff was friendly and service was fast!!!<//Text>

We have been going to Mistura since it opened.  We always enjoy the food and talking with the very nice owners and staff.  I cannot recommend this place highly enough. Go with the rotisserie chicken and sides.  It feeds 2-3 people.  I wish every restaurant in Oakland was like this one.<//Text>

We had a variety of their food, it was good, but for the price could have eaten better somewhere else.  However, the best thing about this place is that they had tasty rotisserie chicken. If that was all I wanted to eat, I'd go back again.<//Review>

I loved this place, but I think they have potential to do better. The chicken was absolutely amazing. The two vegetable dishes are too small so I had to order both.  The spinach & feta salad was heavy on the salty / briny flavors for my taste, but that could also be because I refrain from eating any sugar and so had to forgo the vinaigrette that it comes with. The servers were total sweethearts and the place was totally charming, just hoping they add some veggies!< /review>

The chicken in the cilantro soup was so good! Perfectly cooked, in a rich, wonderfully flavorful broth. The quinoa salad didn't have a lot of quinoa in it, but did have a generous portion of chicken. Recommended.< /Text>

My new favorite for Peruvian. The roasted chicken was moist, flavorful, and the skin, crisp. The Lomo Saltado was the best I've ever had. Prior to coming here, Peruvian was not high on my list of favorites, but this restaurant has changed that. The service is attentive and friendly. The prices are average for the area. Don't hesitate to go!</review>

<Text>It was good, but not great and somewhat overpriced for what we got. We had the quinoa and goat cheese salad - nothing special. Plantains - good, $5 for 4 slices. I had the chicken and my friend had the vegetables. Overall nice quiet place good for a conversation over a meal but I probably wouldn’t go back for the food.< /Text>< user_name>

Wow. That rotisserie chicken tastes just exactly how you would ever want it to taste. Their sauces are also unconventional as compared to other restaurants, but they're delicious.<//Review>

Your entree comes before your appetizer, and their embarrassing excuse for Huancaina sauce is slathered on everything, even the causa - which is a cardinal Peruvian cuisine sin. Don't waste your $ on this restaurant.</Review>< Pictures>

•The "Lomo Saltado" was delicious!! One of the best Lomo Saltados I have tried in Peruvian restaurants within the Bay Area. If you would like to pair it with a red wine, I extremely suggest you to order a glass of "Sunce Zinfandel" or "Sunce Syrah" red wine from the Menu.

•The "Rotisserie Chicken" was okay, that's my opinion as a Peruvian who has lived its entire life in Peru, but I can't say that it was bad. You are going to like it whether you are Peruvian or not. If you are Peruvian, don't expect the "Rotisserie Chicken" to taste or be like a true "Pollo a la Brasa" from Peru.</Review>

Servings looked small but were VERY filling. Lomo saltado was to die for and the quality of the meal was amazing. My boyfriend and I have been trying out the lomo at each Peruvian place we go searching for the best one and this is definitely a contender! Also they just got a beer on tap and it was delish. Service is also amazing!< /Review>

Exquisite delicious Peruvian food. Nice ambience and friendly staff. Good quality food (organic and no gmos) for the price. Make sure to try the ceviche and seco de cordero for authentic Peruvian dishes. Of course the rotisserie chicken and sides are finger licking good. Don't forget the crema volteada for dessert with authentic Peruvian coffee. I have been here lots of times and am never disapointed.</Text>

Excellent Peruvian food.  The Pollo a la Brasa (marinated roasted chicken) is excellent. The Lomo Saltado (beef and onion saute) is outstanding. The cerviche is among the very, very best in the entire Bay Area. Piedmont Avenue is filled with lots of good restaurants. This is an excellent restaurant and a delightful experience. Enjoy!< /Text>

Food was not even close to authentic Peruvian, I know because I am Pwruvian.  Overpriced and not worth the money or time.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) Very Americanized for my taste and very expensive dishes for what they serve. As a Peruvian I am, I do not recommend it, you will be hungry and without money haha

<Time>1618179295341<//Time><Review>I’m new to California and I was looking at so many places reviews. I came across this one and honestly I’m really glad I did. They do really good work. My boyfriend and called ahead and made an appointment to get pedicures and they really payed attention to the details of our nails and the gel polish they did for mine turned out perfect. Not super talkative which I’m not mad about at all, but when they do talk they are very kind and they pay attention to if you’re doing okay and ask you if anything is wrong periodically. Very clean and professional. Make sure to make an appointment because they don’t have a lot of walk in availability. Would recommend and will go back again.</Review>< rating>

I Have been going to them since they opened a salon in Walmart on 47th and S and I will continue to go to them for as long as I need to have my nails done. I am very happy with the quality of my nails, with the quality of my pedicures, with the quality of my manicures, with the quality and the friendliness, And the pricing of everything I have done. I always, always send recommendations over to them when ever people asked me where I get my nails done!☺️👍🏼❤️💕< /text>

<Review>My first time going here. I was desparate looking for a nail salon in the AV and I was debating whether to travel to the Valley to get my nails done. I am so glad I came here. Kim did my manicure and Daniel did my pedicure and they both did an amazing job! I literally felt no pain. My feet feel soft and look amazing. I had a gel manicure done and they look amazing. I am very happy with their service. I will definitely come back. Don't think twice about this place.< /Review>< Date>

<text>Very clean. They use sanitized tools which is a must for me. They are courteous and know what they are doing. My feet haven't felt this great in a long time. I'm new to the area and sometimes finding services are hard. Look no more, if you want your nails and feet DONE, this is where you want to go ladies and gents. Very pleased with my nails and feet🤗<//text>< pics>

Absolutely love this place!  It is what you expect in a spa, quiet, calming, relaxing.  All the technicians are great, but Helen is my favorite.  If you want a real treat, try the Natural Spa Pedicure, it comes with a hot stone massage, hot towel wrap for your legs it is heavenly.  They do great gel nails too! I drive all the way from the east side where nail salons are on every block just to come here, and it is always worth it!< /text>

<rating>4< /rating><text>It was 35.50 total for a full set. Although these are basic acrylic nails, she charged an extra 5.00 for the gel sparkle at the tips plus extra for the length. Not bad and the work she did wasn't lumpy or uneven, very precise and smooth. I would have given them 5 stars if they would have worked with me on what I originally wanted, which wasn't anything crazy. I had pictures and described what I wanted, which could have all been done with gel. I even said more than once that it didn't have to be exactly like the pictures and that I didn't want crystals and what not on them since I'm rough with my nails. For whatever reason the lady didn't want to do gel, kept trying to talk me out if it and add extra for everything, which really surprised me because most salons do everything they can to get you to upgrade to gel. The lady was nice but I could tell she had her mind elsewhere, she seemed distant and uninterested. So, 4 out of 5 stars.</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

The staff here is not enough for many customers at once. Long wait times. I made appointment, I was at the location before they opened, once the salon opened it took time for the open sign to turn on. I ate my breakfast outside directly in front the nail salon. Two ladies walked in then I walked in, they were serviced before me, so my opinion says African woman money no good here ! Hey hey no problem 🥳. First and last time I visit here. Plenty more nail salons around me.
Thanks 🙏🏾< /text>

< Review>
I love getting my nails done here! Ni and her ladies are caring, polite, and amazing . Ni is my favorite because she is a perfectionist! I just resents tried the eyelash extensions and they were very affordable and look very natural! I also love their pedicured because they use a plastic liner in their tubs which I had never seen in any of the local spa and nail salons in my area. I would recommend you to come and try them out . I assure you will be happy about their service! 💕💜💕💅🏽💕💅🏽🤗💅🏽💜</Review>

Got a full set done, it was alright. Both pinky nails are very different shapes. One is thinner than the other. The guy seemed liked he didnt know the nails shapes asked for.</text>

<review>I really enjoyed my very first experiences here today. Great staff, great customer service and high quality works for reasonable price! I had to wait about 10 minutes until my turns but it's definitely worth it. They warmly greeted me with smiling faces and made me feel like home. I had regular Mani/Pedi and it turned out great. The place was really huge, clean and well organized with plenty of modern chairs. I would definitely come back one more time before heading back to my hometown! Highly recommended.< /review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Horrible job. The service was great but they did an awful job at a full set. Some nails are crooked, too thick at the cuticle, wider than my natural nail. They seemed to be in a super rush even though no one else was there. Will not go back. Don't go here if you want them to look good.<//Review>

<review>My wife had her eyelashes done and not only do they fall off but the female(manager) who did them was very disrespectful n rude to my wife. She came home crying n upset. She was humiliated in front of ppl. The manager was so unprofessional she raised her voice n didn't allow my wife to explain to her what she was doing wrong. She went back to get them re done and that just made manager more mad. She had the nerve to tell my wife to shut up as if she was child. I do not recommend this place to anyone. It is sad that a beautiful place has very bad customer service.</review>< pics>

<date>1488512719169<//date><rate>1<//rate><Review>First off, the design I showed her, she immediately told me she couldn't do it because the product they used was powder. Okay, fair enough. The second design, which I thought was a simple ombre with glitter, she told me she might be able to do, but can't guarantee anything. I should've taken that as a sign but decided to go along with it anyway. She didn't cut my cuticles and when she was shaving them down, she kept cutting my cuticles, so my thumb and middle finger were bleeding. The picture I showed her, the nails were square, but I like them round and when I told her to shape them round, she looked at the picture and said those nails were square. Uhm, okay, but shaping them round isn't going to change the design. Finally, as she was putting on the polish, she used a combination of gel and regular polish and she didn't even use a UV machine! She just used a regular fan! I thought, "Does this place not use UV machines?". Nope, just the lady doing my nails because the lady sitting next to me was drying her nails under a UV machine. So as she was attempting to do the ombre, polish kept getting wiped off or smeared, to which she would say, "You need to let them dry longer". Oh, and before she even started putting polish on my nails, she made me pay right then and there and THEN started putting on polish. Good thing I didn't leave her tip. Will NOT be coming back here.< /Review>< pics>

Horrible lady running this place!- I went here because they are the only known salon for SNS nails in this area. I have had SNS nails done in Glendora CA many times and love them, so I came in today for a set but the lady has no clue what she is doing! She had to put 5 coats on my nails and tried to say the powder color I picked is bad but it's just her. When you do SNS nails you are supposed to turn down the speed of the dremel to file it so it doesn't heat the powder back up causing discoloration but she left her dremel on high like you would for a Acrylic nails and just kept trying to blame the color! I had SNS powder and gel top coat all over my finger tips and spent my afternoon picking it off my fingers and cuticles --OMG and they don't have nail clips nor did she even know what nail clips are! Their price list is not straight forward- a "regular set" is $35 but apparently that is just for clear powder and paint over the top- for an actual color it's $40 but she said she would take $5 off for the hassle and then still tried to charge me the full price at the end- I gave her her $35 to pay for product because I am not looking for a free nail job but I will NEVER COME BACK- I would rather take the trip out to Glendora to not deal with this lady again. No one should leave a nail salon having to still clean up their nails - you should walk out feeling like you are ready for any event not having to go home and clean up from their mess. If you are not going to take the time and effort to really learn a new style of nails then DONT OFFER IT! Stick to what you know- I'm sure she does great acrylics as I saw a few ladies with them that looked good but don't come here expecting a good SNS set- she refused to believe me that it was the filing process causing the discoloration and just kept putting more coats of powder on top to then file and ruin. I didnt come for an argument- I came for a nice nail date with my daughter but they put my 7year old at the opposite end of the salon getting her nails painted and then tried to tell her no and giggled at her when she asked for a little heart on each of her nails- I told them to do it as I was paying for her nails and had no problem paying for each heart which they charged $10 for. They should not be telling her "NO" or laughing at a little girls request, they should say "ok let me ask your mom if that is ok" instead of making her feel as though she has done something wrong with a simple request- I have never experienced such terrible attitudes and I understand they were busy but I made an appointment a week in advance so that is not an issue I should have to deal with- if you are busy you have to tell customers to make an appointment- don't rush through and do a bad job just to rush to the next customer- that's how you get a bad reputation and no one wants to come back! Take appointments seriously and create more repeat customers! - sorry end of rant<//review>

<Review>Im never going back first she didn't do what I wanted and she painted the nails with regular nail polish. Second I just got them yesterday and I noticed they are all a different length and some are thinner then the others also I taped a desk and one broke. Also she left me sitting while she went and worked on another customer. Then when my nails were finally done she told me to dry them then turned off the light and left me sitting there.</Review></record>

I've been here many times and have never been disappointed by the food. However, the staff could definitely have better attitudes and customer service. The meatballs are a must on anything that you get. And when they say something is spicy (red curry), they mean it is SPICY.< /Text>< Resp>

The service was quick, and the staff friendly, but the food was disgusting. Over salted, over-spiced, and all poured over what looked like cheap spaghetti.

Some of the elements (green beans, etc) were ok, if they hadn't been sloshed with sauce. The meat looked like cheap ground beef, and burnt on top of everything.

Cheap by Santa Monica standards, but overall unimpressive.<//text>

Asian chipotle. Its good, not the best but the portions are a decent side and best of all they have siracha galore! Seating sucks...so just grab your food to go and eat at the promenade next to a performer.</text>

Started by the same owners as Chipotle--genius! Perfect for customized, quick, and tasty asian fusion dishes. I wouldn't recommend the desserts though.<//Review>

The food is flavorful yet too salty. I will give 5 star if it was not that salty.< /text>

Its Asian chipotle - literally. Same concept but different style of food. Delicious and reasonably priced.</Text>

4 stars because they added gluten containing egg rolls to the menu. Used to be a dedicated GF, dairy free business which was great for someone with Celiac disease like me. I can no longer safely eat at Chipotle because of cross-contamination...hope that doesn't become true for their other restaurant, Shop House.< /Review>

Asian chipotle - fresh, interesting fusion dishes at a reasonable price. Hope they expand nationwide they'd be a hit!<//Review>

(Translated by Google) Asian restaurant that allows, in addition to choosing dishes from the menu, to be able to create your own according to your preferences: adding ingredients, spices or various seasonings, always maintaining that delicious Asian flavor. Average prices and perfect location on the Promenade.

I am so grateful to have found Honey - tho it was literally a few weeks before the pandemic shutdown. Extra grateful that they continued to be there -virtually- the past year and are now easing back to in person classes. It is truly a special place filled with special people.< /Text>

I love Honey. It's been an awesome place to reclaim my past and semi forgotten love for yoga. Every class I've taken has been super intentional with enough time for meditation/breath work, strength building and flexibility/stretching. The studio, while on a busy street, has a great, modern, clean, cleansing ambiance. Highly recommend! Good for beginners and experienced.<//Text>

I love Honey Yoga! This beautiful studio is such a Talmadge gem! The owners, Olivia & Bridget, are genuine, personable and amazingly talented women. They have created a space that is warm and welcoming and always judgment-free. I always feel challenged and inspired at every single class. Honey Yoga is the BEST!< /Text>

I have finally found my yoga studio home!! After trying a few different studios around San Diego I could tell Honey Yoga was the one after my first class. Everyone has been so welcoming and genuine and all the teachers are great!  I love that each class is accommodating to all levels and it is definitely a judgement free zone. Cannot recommend this studio enough!<//text>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>HONEY YOGA IS THE MOVE! As the other reviewers have shared, this space is really like no other. What a gem it had been to find this studio in my second year in SD; I only wish I had found it sooner! Everyone in these reviews means it when they say this place is completely judgement free- not only from the lovely owners & instructors- but the other members and community as a whole. This is a come as you are place and all levels are challenged and catered to. Honestly one of the main reasons I’m hoping I can stay in SD after finishing grad school this year is so I don’t have to leave Honey!!<//Review><Gmap_id>0x80d954239968d8e3:0x14e887c30ab69da3</Gmap_id>< pictures>

I was so lucky to find this place. It is relaxed, has a great vibe, and the women who run it are very nice and laid-back. I have only been twice, but trust me, I will be getting a full membership and will be coming regularly. Their classes are good for all experience levels, and are challenging and relaxing at the same time. And don't let the name throw you; this place is great for men too 😊</review>

<review>Honey is the absolute jam and a true jem in the Talmadge area! I've been coming since they opened. I've always found them to be extremely welcoming of all levels of experience. The instructors are fantastic and all have their own vibe so you can find who fits your practice. Yoga can sometimes be an intimidating world to step into and that is NOT the case here. From the owners, to the instructors, to the fellow members, everyone is so nice. I've loved adding honey yoga to my regular fitness and life routine!

There is a nice bathroom. One missing star only for no shower and a bit of noise from street traffic. That said,  they do well to keep the vibe serene with sheer drapes and a nice level of music. Overall a lovely experience and a warm community.< /review>< Rate>

The $30 for 30 days is probably the best yoga deal of all time and this is a lovely space. I was even lucky enough to have a one on one class with Bridget who is a magnificent instructor and plays good music. Every single yoga facility I have experienced in the last 4 or 5 years has been a letdown and Honey exceeded my expectations and makes practicing yoga something I look forward to!<//Review>

Honey Yoga is a warm and inviting studio!  I love the classes and especially classes with Bridget.  I can tell she has thoughtfully planned for each of her classes as they are varied and flow very smoothly.   Also, Bridget displays a wealth of knowledge in proper technique and safety for each asana/pose.  Love this studio and all of the instructors! Can’t wait for the next class!</review>

I've recently started my yoga practice with Honey Yoga and I'm truly enjoying the experience. The studio is clean, bright and airy and everyone is so kind. Yoga isn't an easy practice for me - actually harder for me than circuit training (I'm not very bendy;) but at Honey Yoga, I feel I am making strides with every class. There's no pretense or pressure in the studio and it's clear everyone is made to feel comfortable and welcome, no matter what level. I'm kind of obsessed with the 'Sunday Honey' class and 'Honey Restore' on Wednesday. I really am so happy I found this studio!</review>

Honey Yoga is by far the most genuine yoga studio I've attended in San Diego (and southern California). The instructors, owners, and family found here are present and engaged with sincere practices that engage the body while letting the mind find clarity.</text>

Do yoga here!!!!  This is a sweet cozy place that nourishes my soul and body. I've been waiting for this kind of yoga pace to open near me and I'm so glad it's finally here.  If you like good vibes, knowledgeable instructors,  a low pressure, and a supportive environment this is the yoga studio for you! Yoga adds years to your life and LIFE to your years!< /review>

I am completely new to yoga, so new that my yoga journey started with Honey yoga opening their doors a few months back. This studio and its owners Bridgette and Olivia are absolutely wonderful and delightful. They are so warm and Inviting and I truly feel as if I’m part of a family. Also they always remember my name and greet my when I walk through the door! (Talk about accountability!)
The practices are well rounded, definitely a perfect fit for newbies like myself or those who can stand on one hand and can bend themselves into cute little pretzels.  I am always supported and encouraged by the instructors and have never felt like I am out of my league with the great mix of skill levels in the practices. I actually enjoy having such different skill levels, makes me set goals farther then just being able to touch my toes!
They also offer classes to help focus on different elements of yoga practice which have been great as well. I always leave feeling inspired and loved. I’m so appreciative of these Honeys and truly love this gem in our neighborhood!</text>

<Text>I signed up for the 6am class with Amanda via the MindBody Android app...5 mins before the class started haha...and bought the new client $30 for 30 package so I can be unlimited this month and try all the classes. Amanda's Honey 60 class was just what the Dr. ordered! I was on the island of Hawaii last week and hiked Waipio Valley's massively steep grade...my hamstrings have hated me ever since...until this morning!

The studio is so cute! They have all the "extras" you'd expect of a boutique yoga studio: Blocks, Blankets, Cushions, Aromatherapy, straps, dim lighting, even lavender scented eye masks and an Aloe Vera plant.

The studio is easy to find, and highly inviting. The website has great personality. And, I love their logo and brand...It's adorable, professional, and relatable.

Amanda's class was so great! She's an incredibly talented instructor. She gently corrected my form (with my permission), where needed, added the right pressure to intensify the stretches, where appropriate, and even closed with a light, relaxing head massage during Shavasana.

I'm looking forward to continuing my practice at Honey Yoga!</Text>< pics>

<Time>1625858837603< /Time><text>My experience with this company was so negative that I felt compelled to write this review so that others can be wary when dealing with this company - especially if they are considering buying a condo in a CMS managed community. I have read reviews from those who own in a CMS managed community - expressing concerns over their investment literally rotting away due to CMS's management. However, renters should also be wary.

I have suffered the unfortunate experience of residing in a CMS managed community. My experience with their representative, Karen Ecoff, has been absolutely detestable and downright repugnant.

The level of customer service and professionalism I have received, as a result of the above mentioned CMS representative, was little to none during my lease. She consistently ignored issues I tried to bring up or always manages to conveniently blame her secretary. In addition to her lack of accountability, she is regularly responds to my concerns with new, frivolous and unrelated complaints against me. With this kind of management, gaslighting, attitude and (lack of) leadership, nothing was ever resolved, or it took a ridiculous amount of time to do so.

For example, we once went without hot water for nearly a month (in December) partly because the CMS representative, Ecoff, did not believe the water was cold. She had the audacity to vehemently insist that the lukewarm water coming out of both my kitchen sink and shower was hot, while the plumbing contractor was right next to us with a temperature gun confirming it was not the 118 degrees required for it to be considered hot. Unfortunately this wasn't an isolated incident - this happened twice with two different contractors. This blatant example of not caring about your residents was extremely frustrating to say the least, as well as an embarrassment (on CMS/Ecoff's part).

In addition, the community itself was always in a constant state of disarray and disorganization. The mailroom was always messy and mail is frequently stacked in a corner. Delivery drivers are unable to enter the complex (because Karen Ecoff was never in the office during normal business hours to open the gate) so they would resort to honking at the gate. The stream was always dirty or broken.

These are just some, out of a very long list of complaints I have against CMS/Ecoff/Management. For the duration of my lease, it seemed as if there was always a new (and often unresolved) issue/conflict. It got so bad that I had to request that Ecoff desist from contact me (the tenant) directly regarding any complaints/issues regarding the unit. I requested that she contact my landlord/unit owner directly regarding any issues.

In addition to not caring about the residents, the CMS representative never seemed to know which people were residents, forgetting that certain residents were residents. Or perhaps she only cared about certain residents and not others. In my time here, I've noticed certain residents are expected to abide by rules while other residents are not.

Overall, instead of creating a community both efficient and welcoming, the CMS Rep seeks to (unsuccessfully) police the community she has been hired to manage. Needless to say, I did not renew my lease and chose a different community - one that values efficiency, communication and excellent customer service; as well as a community where (ALL) residents are valued.

If you would like to read more feedback on CMS, look up their Yelp page. Their ratings are just as low there.<//text>< user>

Worst property management company I've ever had to deal with. I've lived in a complex managed by this horrible company for 1 1/2 years. In that time our hot water has gone out on at least 5 occasions. When you report the issue, the management company tries to blame the issue on the tenants and say we need to replace parts in our faucets, when the boiler system the water runs on has needed to be replaced or upgraded for years. The laundry rooms are always a mess and the washers and dryers are consistently broken and steal the tenants money and they have taken months of complaints to get them fixed. The dumpsters are always overflowing with garbage and the grounds aren't maintained very well. This company needs to be shut down and people need to have their HOA fees returned.</text>

I have written the HOA manager Nicole about 6 times regarding the re-opening of our pools since it has been closed for over a year. We are the only Condos in the area that don’t have our pool open and she gives me the same answer every time and refuses to return the fees we’ve been paying Into the maintaining of the pool. I have even spoken with San Bernardino County and they say the pools may be opened it’s the association keeping it closed. They claim to have liability insurance on each tenant so I do not see what the issue is. The landscaping around here is a mess, our laundry rooms always need maintenance..I truly believe the association is pocketing our homeowners association fees for their personal use. There are light fixtures out around the complex which make it unsafe to go out at night as our area is pitch black. There are so many issues around the condominiums and the association’s  priority was to re-paint the staircases!! They only have the trash picked up twice a week so the dumpsters are almost always overflowing which is an extreme safety hazard. I agree with every single 1 star review that this association needs to be shut down and the homeowners returned their fees because obviously the fees are not being put to good use.< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Very bad property management company for HOAs. the HOA rate has been stable for 10 years in my community, once they took over, they start to bully on homeowners, charging fees here and there, and threaten to place liens to Homeowners. We try to work with them to resolve the issue with them within 24 hours after being notified and paid them, and they insist on charging hundreds of dollars of fees and penalties to the homeowners. I have worked with dozens of HOA in the past, CMS has the worst service attitude for its clients.</Review>

I own two condos that are managed by this company. They set up rules to squeeze as much money out of you as possible, and do not do much to keep property properly maintained. Dealing with their staff is annoying and tiresome for that reason, as they evade proper dealing of any situation.</Text>

Whittier  Villas, Caron Hope is the rep
All these negative comments sound like my issues! They must train them to be insensitive, rude, demanding, sarcastic, liars, pushy and unprofessional.  Even though these characteristics can be seen in the property managers, it’s the Board of the Associations that instruct them on their property managers actions and responses to the homeowners. I have had all these same issues where I live too! Right now I have a pile of dirt and broken up concrete in front of my garage going on two weeks, it’s very hard to get in and out of the garage. For two years I’ve complained about a water leakage in the concrete in front of my garage. I’ve had many water issues in my unit, none that they can correct or even find. I received a notice that they would be laying new asphalt, I emailed Caron asking why they would do this when the leak coming up on the asphalt hadn’t be fixed, and that it’s a waste on money to do this work without fixing the leakage problem. It’s a very big area that has gotten bigger over a  2year period! Twice I’ve been told by the plumber they sent out that they need to fix it or it will keep getting bigger and turn into a more costly repair. The board has to make the decision to do the repairs or not, obviously they refused to have Caron call a plumber to fix the leak, and it brings much delight to Caron to ignore my complaints. I’ve emailed her 3 times these past two weeks, she’s never responded back to me. She didn’t even let me know a plumber would be coming out. He showed up one morning , and thank God he was courteous enough to ask me to move my car out of the garage because he was going to start breaking up the concrete. The work went on for 1week, he didn’t return the next week and that pile of rubble is still in front of the garage with wood covering the hole he dug up. No one, not the board not Caron has called to tell me to tell me what’s going on. I called Caron, it went to straight to voicemail WITHOUT Caron’s introduction. Ummm, I wonder what that means????  The board of our HOA doesn’t know or care about due diligence, they make their own rules, tweek the amendments, rules and regulations to benefit themselves and the business managers, who supposedly know the laws and choose to gladly disregard the rules and regulations even though they know what they are doing is wrong.<//text>

<Text>We used to live on Lookout Circle, Chino Hills and our community manager's name is Dawn from CMS. Poor management, horrible communication and most importantly, EXPENSIVE HOA fee for little or no amenities.  Like some of these Google review suggested, their success in only money not helping people. We had to move out of that place simply because of the HOA. If you are looking for a new home, do your homework, if it is managed by these folks, god bless you..<//Text><time>1570698779415<//time>< response>

They hired security because cars were being broken into but instead of protecting cars they were writing "tickets" and having them towed, sometimes without leaving a "ticket". Now there's a class action lawsuit against the towing company but CMS should be held responsible for unlawfully having cars towed since they were complained to by the residents. Also, they don't fix problems that occur. They send out a roofer to put a bandaid on the problem but won't actually fix it.</Text>

HOA fee is really high, but they claim not to have money, even though no repairs have been made since I own the place.</Review>< Name>

I wish there was an option for giving ZERO star. Our community has been using this CMS for years. The staff for our community are rude, impatient, barely picks up the phone calls. When issues occur, they want us to resolve them, even though it's their responsibility. Really want to know how can we change to a different management service.<//Text>

This company is unfit to be a property management company they cannot even manage their staff, let alone the communities. My HOA switched over to this outfit starting this year and the property manager keeps picking on us quoting the CC&R left and right and when I reviewed the text nothing makes sense and I inquired she asked her management Jim to return phone call and he knows nothing about the case and just called to block for her. They treat customer like "you know what" and does not understand the customer service side of the management business and my HOA fired them 10 year ago and the new board go back to them without checking their depressed rating. Sorry decision!< /text>

< Review>
They are rude, arrogant and unkind.  They act like they know for sure they will keep that job and stay in business.  Horrible!!  They are just there because they feel they are entitled to be there.  No customer service oriented at all.  Very nasty.  They do not return phone calls, do not care about their customers.  They act like they are doing us a favor and for free!!  I felt terrible dealing with Brenda and McCready or whatever is his name, a very arrogant rude unkind man.  No wonder the employees are not kind , if the owner and managers are not kind. What can we expect.  El que es perico donde quiera es verde!!   Not experience in dealing with people and they make money and are in business because of us the customers. What they do not understand is by being so mean they are the ones who are poor and lack professionalism..  They need training but they do not care at all.  They need anger management and learn how to deal and resolve in a timely manner residents (who are their customers),  needs. . , They would be good working in Venezuela for Nicolas Maduro, he will be very pleased with these harsh and rude workers who have not idea how to talk to people.   Their success is only money not helping people. They are in the wrong business. in the wrong job.   Today I decided to write a review and I am not surprised to read other reviews as well, I was thinking maybe they were unkind only with me but I realized that is true that saying that people can offer and give only what they have.  this so called management company and their employees, these workers in this so called management company can offer and give what they have, and this is the best they can do.  Shame on this called management company and shame on his owner and managers and employees.</Review>

They don't answer their phones, you can't speak with them if they are out on "business" for another association  they manage  because they won't give you their cell phone number! Really the cell phone we help pay for? They provide no email address for correspondence on any of their literature or bills, in this day and age are you kidding me!  They are rude, and seem to forget who helps pay for their paychecks. Very sorry that our HOA chooses to use them.<//text><Gmap_id>0x80c331ce20633353:0x2cd8b74f213c4be1<//Gmap_id>< user>

This management company has lied to the residents of my community for years saying the HOA does not cover roofs on attached condominiums.  I went to an attorney for a consult and the HOA is responsible for the roofs.  So I had an IDR meeting with CMS rep Jack and the HOA president and presented them with the law AB968 and the attorney's opinion.  The CMS rep continues to lie to property owners to this day a year later.  I just sold my property and they have jeopardized my escrow closing because Jack lied to my buyer's agent regarding roof responsibility.  DO NOT WORK with CMS!  They are negligent of their duties to advise boards of legalities and are making CMS liable for collusion.</text>

<review>I'm currently the president of a small HOA and CMS has been our property manager and business agent for about 12 years. We've had two agents and they've both been competent and responsive.  They manage the common area only; all the residences are individually owned so CMS isn't involved with repairs to the residences.  I haven't experienced the type of problems mentioned in many of the other reviews.  I'm inclined to believe most reviews are written by people who have an ax to grind.

I agree with the comment that the owner can be abrupt at times but fortunately I don't have to deal with him but on rare occasions.<//review><Time>1492450748379< /Time><Resp>None< /Resp><pictures>None<//pictures>< rate>

I like O'Reillys but lately the price tags are placed wrong. When I go pay another price pops out when I let the cashier know they go check and just say "that is not in the right spot." But there is more of the same product in that spot. I hate when I deal with that.</Review>

< Review>
Been coming here for years and it has been going down hill steadily.  The people who work here are the Dumbest idiots anywhere.  One person tells you of course you can return the item if it doesn't work for you, I come back the next day and I am told NO, this is a no return item.  I have to call their Regional Manager in order to get my money and the store manager makes excuses.   Will NEVER go to Oreily again.   Save your sanity, your time and money and buy online or at any other store.  These people don't deserve our business.  If I could give them Minus 10 stars I would.  WORST customer service.   I hope you idiots go out of business.< /Review>

<Review>It's pretty typical for an O'Reillys.  The shelves were a bit bare for motor oil.  I think I got the last case of 5W-30.  That might make me think twice about coming here again.</Review>< pictures>

<date>1548362254166</date><rate>1</rate><text>So as a loyal member of o'reilly's I was utterly dumbfounded to come from Stockton to san Jose just to be told first what's the price, do I have a print out, then I even called Home Depot and had the guy tell me EXACTLY what the price was for the 5qt.  Castrol Gtx 5w-30 motor oil, and after finally 20 minutes of proving that the one literally less than 1 mile away has the same exact product for 4.97 of the one quart and $17 something of the 5quart she says sorry can't go that low.  If you can get it that low you should just go there...???????  Are you kidding me??  Bet that's the last time I step into O'reilly's for the ENTIRE year at least. That just wasted my time,  your time, and why would you say you price match if you "can only go so low".  False advertisement at its finest. I'm disgusted with this employee PERIOD.< /text>< Pics>

<review>A lot of fun for really a very reasonable price!

Urban Putt is for sure a SF staple among the 21-29 crowd so I was glad to finally make it over there a couple weekends ago for a little birthday fun.

It’s only 12 bucks a person to play which was surprising considering the popularity of this place, and we were able to get canned beer for only 3 bucks a pop which blew me away. A very wide selection of craft cocktails and different beers so definitely makes for a fun game of golf (even if your game suffers a little bit).

When we came it was around 5pm on a Saturday and it was crazy crowded - took about 30 minutes to make it to the course and people are either waiting on you or you on them basically most of the time which is tough. I know it’s 21+ after 8 though so I personally would opt for that in the future.

Courses are very unique and fun - I was surprised by their originality. It’s not a full 18 holes, just 14 but that actually feels like a good number by the time you get there.

Tons of fun would definitely go back!<//review>< Pics>

This spot is so much fun!!!!! I mean mini golf & a bar 👍🏼 The girl at the front was friendly and funny & the bartenders were super cool and made some great drinks! Good selection of craft beers on tap too! The course is super small but it is created & designed in such a clever way!
The only request is the get some A/C in the course room 😆 but still 5 stars!</Review>

Been going here for years, always a nice time out whether it’s with a group of people or a nice 1:1. Great for kids and big kids alike. Can get pretty crowded at peak times, but if you’re not in a rush, enjoy a cocktail at the bar or some of their shareable snacks and you’ll be fine. Lots of putting holes packed into a small space, each uniquely its own theme and well thought out. There also is a side room you can rent or relax in away form the bar, which can be rented. Great time for all!< /Review>

What an amazing place! We started our evening at the restaurant on the second floor. The food was delicious, service was great, and the drinks were good. The food wasn't too pricey but I do think the drink prices are a bit steep considering how small they are. After dinner, we went downstairs to pay for mini golf. The woman at the register had great customer service and gave my boyfriend a free game since it was his birthday. There was a bit of a line to begin playing, but we got drinks from the bar and observed the other players while we waited. Each course was very unique and exciting. Some were more challenging than others but it was all fun. The place isn't too big so we ended up in a couple traffic jams with other players. You're allowed to bring your drinks on the course and tables are provided at each hole. We went on Wednesday night and it was surprisingly packed. Everyone we met was really nice and we plan to come back!< /Text>

<review>Loved it! Whoever designed the place and all the different holes must be a super engineer. I've played a lot of mini golf courses and this is hands down the most complex one I've seen to date. Every hole was unique. Great for corporate team building or just a night out with friends.

<Review>Very creative indoor mini golf. Wonderfully designed holes utilising the limited space they have.

Multiple bars and eating facilities on two floors. Some carnival sports games in a side room, photo booth hidden in a hallway.

This place exudes creativity. Family friendly during the day as well. Absolutely worth a visit! located in the crowded mission district in San Francisco so be prepared to figure out your parking.< /Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMHj_ffuh2qypcTvQuitNpHWyRtz0N7II7dYTYY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMH5mFtp8NJSIZqDYodZmrWQTotzwXZcZVNRPYl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOx-rPSaxTiuPww3eL3AqDUEUVoK3r03yR0rILc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMEG4Mq3957O4HuSG_ji5vK0PARlbi-NP1vQf4E=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><Resp>{'time': 1566913731195, 'text': "Creativity is what we're all about!

<rate>4< /rate><Review>Mini-golf in the city, you can't really go wrong!  $12/game per person,  you can order drinks to have on the course while you putt!  Just food can't be brought onto the course with you.  The one down side is that going on a Saturday it was packed!  A little more disruptive of a gaming experience given the loud noise and the sheer number of people in such a small area.  Wish they had more holes, but there was a good variety of set ups, some cool mechanical ways to watch your ball travel on a few of the holes!  Worth going to!<//Review>< pictures>

< Review>
We came here for our company outing from 4pm-7pm on Thursday (20 people) and we taken really good care of. We had private room reserved for playing hoops and skee-ball and eat and drink, and we also played a round of minigolf (of course). It is a really cute, fun, well-though out course that wasn't too hard for us non-pro minigolfers.

The drinks were top-notch (had Stairway to Heaven & Gin Lime Ricky), food pretty good (only 2 vegan options though, the mini vegan tacos and a green salad), but the boys had plenty of sliders and pizza to keep them satisfied . Service was excellent starting from the bartender and ending to the manager who kept making sure we were allright with drinks and food and the space and he even offered us to keep the room as late as we wanted since it was a slow night which was magnificent bonus for the youngsters who can still stay up later than 7pm. I'd def recommend this place for company outings as well as a date night.</Review>

An absolute blast!  Each hole of golf had it's own theme and was so fun to putt around. The pretzel from the bar was good and drinks were very tasty. The food upstairs at the restaurant was great and very fair in pricing. Service all around was exceptional.   Groupon was buy one entry get one entry thus on $6 to putt a game per person. I'd suggest putting a reservation in for the restaurant when you arrive (if it's a busy night) and putt while you wait. I see many night outs here in the future!</Review>

We spent 30mins waiting in line to play on a Friday night. The actual holes were cool with fun mechanics. It was a chance to chat with people and hangout, but it was definitely a struggle due to the everyone crowding into such a small space.<//Review><Gmap_id>0x808f7e38e7b22169:0x4cdb309320bb79d<//Gmap_id><name>Yousef Alowayed</name></record></dataset><record>

<review>It's certainly fun as a first timer. Very creative mini golf course. I kinda wish the place was bigger so that you're not crammed waiting for other players but I get it. It's a small place, smallish bar area. I probably wouldn't come again but I'd tell my friends about it. I think everything should experience it at least once.</review>< gmapID>

A fun idea, very badly designed and managed. Expect long waiting times, followed by bottleneck after bottleneck. The 4th hole, a sort of video game, had a line backed up through the entire play area. Other holes featured mechanical gimmicks that took far too long to play out and, multiple times during our visit, jammed up.

This might be worth trying on a slow night after 8pm when it's 21-and-up. If people are waiting outside, just keep walking.< /Review>

We had to queue up for 40 minutes but it went by fairly quickly with bar and drinks nearby. The putt SF themes were creative and fun and fairly challenging. It was a good time, but probably a one time thing worth trying for me. There's also a restaurant above and I recommend the grilled cheese sandwich and the wings.< /Review>< rating>

<Name>Kyle Lowman< /Name><review>Great little course, an amazing mix of various obstacles that are very interactive, and they serve alcohol! Wait times can be horrible but that's to be expected at such a fun place,  12$ a head though and you can get through the course pretty fast so don't expect to be there long.

Fun and very entertaining atmosphere, would definitely come back if there isn't a huge line.<//review><user>118173668664573637767< /user>< Pictures>

A very fun family friendly putting experience. While not truly a "mini-golf" location, it's still worth a visit for all ages. They have a time only for adults and an extension bar which does make the experience more fun.</review>

Found out about this place based on random Google search..."what to do in SF when it rains"

So cool! Gota be the best crazy golf ever! Especially holes 3, 9 and 10. Super cool!

Good selection of beers, cocktails and bar snacks.

Highly recommended and would go back anytime!<//text>

This is hands down one of my favorite putt putt spots.

Urban Putt is a putt putt golf place located in the Mission district of San Francisco. It's a relatively cramped place that makes the most use out of its space. It's a San Francisco themed course were creative and original. I've never seen any other putt putt places use as many ideas as this place.

You'll spend about 1-2 hours here assuming that the line moves rather quickly. ~$10 per person to play. Good for family, friends, and corporate events. There is also a bar in the back serving beer for those 21+ looking to wet their whistle while they wait or play. Drink holders are available at each hole for those who are still drinking their beer.

I couldn't drink while I was in SF so I can't comment on the beer selection, but from what everyone else was drinking -- it looked good.

Urban Putt is definitely a place you can bring to impress your friends or coworkers. Great way to find something new to do in the city.

5/5. Favorited in the city.< /Text>

Although always packed, Urban Putt offers a great selection of drinks for adults and a bright and fun atmosphere. Best to go with a family before 8pm or with friends and other adults after 8pm.</text>

Loved my experience at Urban Putt! This place is a great place in the city to play indoor mini golf and also enjoy a beer or two while you're there. I love the attention to detail they have for the golf course. They have a lot of fun contraptions that the golf balls go through and I've never seen this done before. It does get pretty busy at night though, so be warned as it's a pretty small area and you'll have to wait before each hole. But overall it's still a great time if you're looking for a fun night out in the mission.</Text>

Very fun holes. Lots of cool Rube Goldberg type contraptions. Apparently over 40 artists, industrial designers, carpenters, programmers, etc worked on the course. Definitely recommended. Only issue is you can't bring drinks on the course.</Review>

12$ for the ticket. We were there on a Friday night and there was a queue for 45 min. They ask us to buy drinks while we wait in the line.

The golf courses ⛳ were easy to play and fun. I liked the under water concept and the skeleton course. Some of them were too congested and had to wait till the groups ahead finished.</review>

Only reason why this is not 5 stars, is when I came here 1 hole was out of order and some other parts of course didn't work properly. However we still did have fun and enjoyed out time here. It is nice to have a full bar while you play, and the course is very fun and can be a bit challenging; which is great!< /Text>

Really great space and always updated to keep you entertained. To he bar serves craft beers and drinks, but most importantly you can play putt putt golf. The steam pink metal feels perfect for the setting. Some genius designs of getting the ball around the course. All around one of my favorite local spots.< /review>

Had a really nice first experience here tonight! The course featured a lot of really cool holes specific to Denver/Colorado. Also had a lot of cool technology I’d never seen for minigolf before! Went as a date, but will definitely bring a group of friends along next time! Had the Caddy Shack pizza, which was pretty great and then we were offered a free dessert - which we obviously took them up on! Ordered the Devil’s Food Cupcake which was to die forrrrr, and we learned all desserts are made fresh, in-house! Delicious! Overall I definitely recommend this place for minigolf fans who have a good sweet tooth! We’ll be back!< /text>

<text>Urban Putt is a great mini golf spot in the city. It's creativity laid out, which virtual holes and mechanical parts that moves. The creators did a good job considering that there's not that much space inside. I've seen lots of people of every age here.<//text>< Pictures>

A good place to bring friends and  co-workers out. I really love the amount of creativity they put in, like the space ship course! I'm surprised they were even able to fit 14 holes in such a small space, but they did a great job! Good beer! Will definitely come back again to try the cocktails and good :)<//text>

<Text>Let me preface by saying I have not experienced a round of mini golf here. We came on a rainy day and it seems everyone had the same agenda. We decided not to stay and wait the 30 min wait because it was 30 minutes before you got to the first hole and then you would have to wait behind many parties of children before you were able to go to the next hole. Each hole looks so fun as they have a separate theme (such as under the sea).

I recommend going during the week when there are hopefully less people.< /Text>< Pictures>

This is a really cool little mini golf spot with a nice variety of holes. The quirky themes should be familiar to almost any city savvy Californian, ranging from quakes to the SF skyline. There's even a video golf round and a skee-ball hole. The staff are helpful and friendly. Highly recommended for a fun night out.< /Review>

A unique and entertaining way to spend a couple of hours in San Francisco's Mission neighborhood!  Mini golf your way through a San Francisco's neighborhood (earthquake and all!), under the sea in a submarine and through a number of fun little mazes.  This course is not intended to be difficult, more about having some good clean fun.  Food and drinks are available at the bar and upstairs.  Great cocktails and good wine list.  Great place to come with the kids for some family fun or with a group of adults for some adult fun.<//review>

14 Holes! But, there is a huge bar towards the entrance of the building. The course is pretty small, but half of them are creatively built. Lots of engineering went into this place so if you like things like that, you'll love this unique place. Lastly, there is a restaurant on the 2nd floor and the food is definitely worth it!! Everything is reasonably priced, especially for being in San Francisco. Give this play a try for sure, you won't regret it.<//text>

Urban Putt is a fun place to play indoor miniature golf. The course is pretty much put into 2 rooms and a little cramped, but creative. There's a lot of parking around. It's very family friendly. There is also video games that you can pay for. It's great for birthday parties.  I enjoyed the pizza and wings.</review>

Great place for a date night! Our night started at the bar. The drinks were good. We didn't visit the restaurant (although the food smelled delicious).  Each hole is unique and a table is provided for your drinks. It did get a little crowed so there was a wait at some holes. Overall I had a great night.</review>

Incredibly creative and fun mini golf. They also have a small arcade, a party room (which I've never actually been in) and some neat little steampunk oddities, like "sleepwalker" which is an interactive art installation. Not actually targeted at kids, but my kids love it nevertheless.< /review>

The perfect date spot!

It's often hard to find a place where you can get food, drinks, and entertainment all in one place for a great price, but Urban Putt certainly knows how to pull off this trifecta. It's a mini-golf course goldmine offering quick food service and plenty of drinks to lubricate a night of fun and enjoyment. With a 14-hole course that's steampunk themed and certainly more than just an aim-for-the-hole min-putt, you'll be delighted with a unique experience you won't find in another other city. Urban Putt delivers a high energy, unique experience that proves to be the best alternative entertainment destination for beers, birdies, brunch, and bogeys.</Review>

This is definitely a great place to spend time with friends. I haven't tried the food here but the drinks at the bar they have are really good. The mini golf course itself is themed really well, providing a very interactive experience for mini golfers of all skill levels.

This place was so much fun.

We had a very enjoyable round of mini golf. Ok, my one point of contention... is it really a round of golf if there are only 14 holes? I get it, limited space makes it difficult to cram in 4 more holes.

But the 14 in place were a ton of fun.

Also, we were able to eat in the restaurant. Everything we ordered hit the mark. Stand out was the mac n cheese... get it.</Review>

So we decided to throw convention to the winds and go with 14.\n\nThank you for taking a moment to show some local love.

<rating>5<//rating><Text>When I first heard of it, indoor miniature golf in San Francisco I didn't think it was gonna be great, even more so after I saw the building. It just seemed to small to be possible. Getting inside and actually giving it a go really changed my mind. It's a pretty awesome and unique experience for San Francisco. You can tell the staff who made the place put a lot of effort into every single detail. The holes each resemble some part of SF culture. As well, there's an open bar so you can drink and golf. The theme is almost steam punk in some parts and you get your golf ball out of a gumball dispenser. There's even a mini arcade and photo booth. The course is as much an art piece as it is a recreational phenomena. Also the bathrooms are ample. Kids are able to golf til 8pm so that the adults can have their peace and golf afterwards. It's a very fun course and well priced. Absolutely a must try if you're in San Francisco!< /Text>< Pictures>

Fun time! Some crazy and unique holes. The course is a bit small and claustrophobic at times if near groups. Overall the facility needs to expand and would get the fifth star.< /Text>

Better than any South Bay golfland. Holes are interactive and mechanically wratchet the ball through a trail of tracks and drops that remind me of the old game, mousetrap. Such a sensory experience! Food and drinks are great as well.< /Text>

<text>Fun mini golf decorated with over the top ridiculous San Francisco landmarks. Most of the course is wheelchair accessible with a few holes that you'd have to go up a step or two to play through. I had no trouble in my powerchair as I can walk those few steps!

Looking for a fun activity and great food? You've found the perfect spot at Urban Putt! This 13?-hole mini putt course in SF is a gem -- lots of fun to play and the most creative course I've ever seen. After the game, their bar and restaurant serve plenty of yummy drinks and food. My favorite appetizers are the chicken and waffle skewers and fried olives. The pretzel knots and deviled eggs are also delicious and easy to share. I've organized two alumni events here and the staff and wonderful to work with. Great place!< /Review>

<rate>5<//rate><Text>Seriously one of the best designed mini golf places I've ever been to. They have mini models of the iconic SF buildings and landmarks, creative & challenging holes, and fun variety of obstacles. They serve alcohol which is another plus when you need some liquid encouragement. The course can get crowded and bottlenecked behind the more challenging holes, but it gives you a good break to go grab another drink at the bar. Recommended for dates, team off-sites, birthday parties, and pretty much any occasion.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Haven't tried the food, but the drinks are good and the holes are ingeniously built and a pleasure to play. Good place to go for any occasion - especially dates. this is the best indoor minigolf course I've ever seen.<//review>

Fun San Francisco date night with each hole carefully themed and artist-currated. Just make sure to allot ample time if it's night or a weekend. The holes get backed up easily. Expensive drinks, but I've happily visited many times.<//text>

This place is awesome! I was expecting the usual mini-golf - impressive looking courses with half-maintained mechanics. But this place is something different - complex and fully functioning steampunk holes with really cool/interesting mechanics.

Not to mention the skeeball!

The selection at the bar is also decent.< /review>

Really creative course design. In general I really liked the vibe they create. It can be pretty busy though, so maybe try to avoid peak hours if you mind crowds. Definitely worth the price for the mini golf though... It's just so cute ^.^</text>

I have played in many mini golf places before, and I have to say, I definitely hit the hole in one coming here! This place is really good for those who play golf or not, and they make your experience really good here! Every hole is very unique, and they do an amazing job combining golf and entertainment! It was by far the most fun mini golfing experience I have had, and whether you love golf or not, you gotta chill here at some point! BEST mini golfing place around!< /Text>

You might think an indoor green in the city may leave much to be desired. I'll say think again! You and your friends will love the holes, restaurant, and bar.

This is a hidden gem, in a NOT great area of San Francisco. Not the best parking, nearest garage about 4 blocks away, street parking is rough, so you've been warned. We went on a Sunday afternoon and the place was Packed, if you are closterphopic, do not go here. But if you want a great (little) place for a date or a family outing it is worth checking out. The upstairs restaurant at opening (5:00) was very open and offered some pretty darn good food</text>

A real hidden gem of a hot-spot. A true definition of "fun for all ages." This isn't your typical, hokey putt-putt place. The designers really made incredible use of the remarkably small space they have and make sure to pack in charm and engineering finesse into every inch of the establishment. Each hole tells a story and is both well thought out and artistically appealing. Urban Putt is just about as cool as a place can be. Great attentive bartenders too. I could keep singing this place's praises, but I recommend you try this place out for yourself.< /text>

<Review>Really pretty good fun. I like that the mini golf courses are very localized around San Francisco themes and places. Also some pretty impressive mechanics involved. The place is popular so expect a good amount of queuing at times. We were lucky to come here over the festive season on a quiet night and were putting within 10 minutes.</Review><user_id>113731609127846485889< /user_id>< Rating>

<review>Pretty cool space. Can get crowded and the line moves and there are a few things to keep you entertained as you wait. They have an ok selection of beers. The food looked good but the kitchen was closed when I was there so I can't comment on taste. The golf course is fun. The holes are not too difficult and have fun elements. It is one of the best experiences I've had at beer and mini golf places.< /review><Time>1549740930768</Time>< GmapID>

A fun place. Pretty well hidden in what appears to be a residential neighborhood. Decent bar fare. The mini golf course is well designed and offers s brief history of San Francisco.<//Review>

Really cool place right in the Mission, the indoor mini golf course features lots of cool rube-goldberg like contraptions, which I loved. The whole course was decorated thoroughly, and there were some holes that were like nothing I've ever seen before! (I'd go into more detail but I don't want to spoil it) while it's not the most challenging mini golf course ever, it's a ton of fun. And late on weekends you can bring drinks served at their bar onto the course! Would totally recommend. Good for groups or on a date.</review>

<review>Super fun spot for mini golf and drinks. The course is surprisingly very challenging and really fun. And they allow you to bring your drinks around the course! It's always a great time here.

For company events, we tend to book the small side room, which includes basketball and skeeball. You can purchase unlimited play.

Would go here again - great date spot, friend hangout, or corporate setting. Friendly staff, solid drinks, and fun.</review>< Pics>

< Review>
Urban Putt was easily one of the coolest experiences that was located in the tiniest place ever in one of the best districts of SF.

I came to SF with my fiancé a few weeks ago and a bunch of our friends who live in the area took us to Urban Putt in search of a fun group activity. Although every place in SF is super tiny and cramped, this felt even more cramped especially it being a mini golf place. We came with a group of 9, and it was extremely tough especially since the holes are so close together. I guess it didn't help that we also came out on a Saturday evening. Anyways, they have a bar with beers on tap as well as light bites. There's also a room of skee ball & basketball that you have to pay $1 for. The golf experience itself was $12 per person.

The first couple of rounds were awesome as we had just started and were all super hyped up and keeping score, etc. Towards the end, our patience for each hole got less, we stopped keeping score, and skipped a few holes. It was just too crowded. Some holes were extremely difficult compared to others. For example, hole 1 was super easy, hole 2 was pretty difficult, hole 3 was hard, but hole 4 was impossible. I mean, is it not supposed to go from easy to difficult rather than jump all around? Other than a few flaws here and there, I will say that this was an amazing time. We had many laughs, some had one too many drinks, I was frustrated by the 5th hole, but all in all, I definitely recommend!</Review>

What a fun place for a date! There is a restaurant upstairs with tasty meals along with two full bars. After 8pm it’s 21+, so it adds a little spin to your mini golf experience. In addition to that, the mini golf games where built within a Victorian style Home, how San Francisco is that?!<//Review>

<Review>What a blast!  Started with dinner at the restaurant.  The homemade tamarind soda had just the right tartness and was not too sweet.  The dishes were flavourful and well thought out.  Friendly service and they accomodated our allergy restrictions.

The mini golf was so much fun.  It's all indoors so you don't need to worry about the weather.  The courses are all unique and the craftsmanship and planning that went into them will provide a lot of amusement.  There's just so much to take in... San Francisco icons, Rube Goldberg contraptions, and Steampunk automatons just to name a few.  My favourite was the submarine with all of the switches and sound effects.

Great place for a date night or a friends or family outing.  Highly recommended 😁< /Review></record>

<text>Went with a group.of co-workers. Started with drinks, then went to dinner upstairs. Food was amazing, we had the chicken and waffles for an appetizer and then I enjoyed the seared scallops. We head back down stairs for golf. Not too crowded when we started, but their was a line by 830pm on a Wed. night. Only reason I gi e it 4 stars is i believe $12 per person is a bit steep for 1 round of putt putt, no matter the experience.</text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>{'time': 1536088869617, 'text': "What a fun night with the coworkers, Jessica -- a sure way to bond!

<Review>The bouncer at the door took my friends ID and tried to snap it in half. She said she couldn’t accept her ID because it was “suspicious.” My friend offered to show a PDF of her passport, multiple credit cards, and a school ID in her name as proof she is above the age of 21. Bouncer refused and was super rude and unprofessional. When asked if we could call the police to prove her age she got even angrier. She said “I’m not saying you’re not above 21, I’m just saying your ID is suspicious.” Why??? If my friend can use her ID to get through TSA check then I think she can get through a mini golf place. I hope Urban Putt will pay for the fee for her to get a new ID because the bouncer bender it.< /Review>< Rating>

Love the concept of this place: drinks, bar food, and really unique putt putt. We went on a rainy Friday night though and it was PACKED! Stood in line for about 45min waiting to start, but we had good drinks so it wasn't much different than if we'd spent the night at a bar. It was fun but people really crowd the course and you end up in logjams waiting for the people in front of you to finish while having people behind you run up on you. The course is super original though - would love to try it again when it's less crowded.<//text>

<Review>I loooooovvvveee this place. Honestly, it makes me wish it was my idea to fit an entire mini golf course into a bar sized building. The golf course itself is such good quality. It's very creative and quirky. There is often a line however, you can relax with friends while you wait and drink. It's really a great system and I have always enjoyed my time here. Big props to the people behind this place!<//Review><Date>1521660642723< /Date></record>

A good time with the right people, come during off hours so it's not too crowded. Still fun even if you can't drink on the course. The food isn't too great, but then again it isn't a restaurant so be prepared to eat either before or after. There are plenty of great restaurants around the Mission to explore within walking distance.< /Text>

This place was SO much fun. Absolutely by far the most creative miniature golf course I've ever seen (and I've been to more than a few). Plus booze and food if you want it. Don't forget to play with the levers in Captain Nemo's Nautilus and really try to go when it's not too busy so you can really take in all the holes.< /Review>

My daughter and son-in-law had their wedding rehearsal lunch at Urban Putt.  There was about 40 of us playing golf on this amazing, creative course.  It ran so smoothly and everyone was having so much fun.  We had appetizers before that were yummy. The lunch Urban Putt put out was so delicious and displayed so nice.  They were so accommodating and friendly.  It is not often you can play and eat and everything was excellent.  We are anxious to return soon.  Thank you Urban Putt for helping to make the rehearsal lunch so fun!</text>

Went here with a private party, so probably not a typical experience. The food was pretty good and the drink/beer selection was great. Had a lot of fun at the course and did it twice. There are a few holes that I would guess result in people needing to wait when it gets busy, but the effect is really cool. Had fun with the basketball and skee ball they had, which is free. Would definitely go again, though I'd aim for a time when it's not busy.<//review>

<text>Whoa! This was the most elaborate putt putt course I've ever been on. We had loads of fun. It was a busy night and the course only took us 30 minutes to finish. They put a lot of thought into the place. It's hard not to be impressed at what they were able to do with such a small indoor course.

We also ate upstairs at the restaurant. It's not mind-blowing, but it was better than expected. The chicken and waffles on a stick were great. The rest of our food was fine. Service was friendly and we had a good time overall.<//text><Date>1465588786795< /Date>< user>

Being an SF Native, new businesses are often viewed with a 'side-eye' as they are too often a personification of the gentrification taking place and I tend to avoid them. However, this place was a real treat! The sculptures on the putting course were wonderful, cocktails tasty and the food was great. A fun time was had by all! It can get a bit crowded and the bulk of the clientele are not San Franciscans leading to some side-eye from them, which can get really annoying but I would definitely go back with friends. One of the only new cool spots I would recommend.<//Review>

An unique mini golf experience, just a shame it's not a full 18!<//Review>

We worked hard to maximize the space available to us and in the end realized that we simply could not shoehorn 18 holes in the space we had. We do have several other attractions--the Sleepwalkers interactive art project, SkeeBall, Basketball, and our home-made steampunk Photobooth--that take us, figuratively at least, to the magic number 18.

<Text>This place is one of the most intricate mini putt courses I've ever been to! Depending on the day and time you come you can drink on the course because kids can also golf on it at times. Overall great place to recommend as a first date or a place to take the kids.<//Text>< Time>

<user_id>103657266807263831449</user_id><text>This is crazy cool. Very steam punk style gold holes. There are times you have no idea where your ball went and there it is winding around some maze contraption. It was really busy and really a cool idea. I didn't try the food or drinks but there are plenty. If I had a negative it would be that there were tight quarters around the 14 holes so don't expect a vast amount of space.

This is just a great all around spot. Who doesn't love beer and mini golf.

Whether you're with friends, a tourist, going on a date, or looking for a company outting this place is a ton of fun!

You'll likely end up waiting in line for 20 minutes before you can play because it's very popular.<//review>

Amazing experience. I am a big fan of mini golf and this place was great. Had some of the most unique courses I have ever seen. Had a wonderful time with my wife playing and drinking a few beers. I did not try out the food, but I will definitely be back again to try.</Review>

Amazingly creative mini golf holes packed into a relatively small space.  We got there later than planned after driving around looking for parking for 40 mins. Staff were nice enough to let my 12.5 year old son in. Super appreciated.

Not much space to stand while waiting for people to finish the previous hole. Great artistic and engineering elements around each hole.

They also have a bar and restaurant on site. Would definitely recommend.  It's worth hunting down a parking spot.<//text>

Super fun place! And even though it looks so small, the course takes a good amount of time! You think you'd be done in like 15 minutes but it took us about an hour, I believe. Plus each hole is so different and you get lots of variety, so it's super fun. Just a great atmosphere overall and I highly recommend.< /review>

<text>Seems to be quite hopping, with steady business everyday.
Kinda makes one wonder if there is more to the place than meets the eye.
Curiously girls go in but they don't come out, mysterious - most likely they ditch their men and stay inside having too much fun.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><time>1496632614236</time>< Rating>

<Text>Fitting a 14 hole putt-putt course in a building in the city is pretty remarkable.  The restaurant is upstairs.  Surprisingly great food.  The bar and putt-putt are downstairs.  You can drink on the course, which is a bonus.  There are a lot of places to set down your drink while golfing.  The variety and ingenuity of the holes was exciting.< /Text>< Pics>

Came here on a recent visit to SF and loved it!  Its a 14 course mini golf spot that's indoors with bar and restaurant as well.  Its 21+ after hours so if you have kids come earlier in the day.  Its reasonably priced at $12 for adults and the course takes about an hour without much of a wait.  The course is fun and has a unique setup.  There is a bar to get drinks before/after playing so that's a bonus.</text>

Hosted a kids birthday party at Urban Putt.  The staff was responsive and helpful throughout.  Kids enjoyed the putting and the food, and the catering was timely and good. The manager even comped us a little extra free time in the game room.

I  highly recommend Urban Putt as a birthday location.< /review>

<review>Fun and creative indoor miniature golf with a full bar and restaurant located in the SF Mission district. The golf course is 14 holes and very intimate as it's a small place. Get there early during prime times as the line for golf can get long. Takes about an hour to play with a crowded course so if you plan to have dinner in the restaurant afterwards, I highly recommend running upstairs before playing and making a reservation. The course itself has an SF feel with some cool parts that represent history like the golden fire hydrant. The restaurant serves good food at reasonable prices and the service is awesome.<//review>< Resp>

< Review>
This was my first time going to an indoor miniature golf establishment and while there were some interesting holes, the experience was not as fun for me as an outdoor miniature golf course.

Furthermore, I thought one of the perks of this place was the ability to drink alcohol while playing. Unfortunately, whether or not they allowed it in the past, we were only allowed to drink off he course, so essentially before or after playing.

Returning to the core experience, several of the holes were based more on the aesthetics or some sort of quirkiness related to the hole as opposed to the skill required to sink the ball.

Overall, there was a novelty to the experience, but it could have been better.

Note: I would consider coming back and I would consider giving the place four stars. But I don't think I'd come back any time soon; I'd sooner try and go to all the "nearby" Golflands.< /Review>

I would like to say that there are merits to being indoor -- this allows us to be open during all weather. In addition, our policy about drinks has always been this way, with no drinks on the course. With one MAJOR EXCEPTION: Monday. For the first day of the week, you are allowed to bring your drinks with you while you play. That said, I'm glad you noticed our focus on fun and creativity, and although it sounds like you prefer a challenge, we do hope you'll consider giving us another try.

Great place to play a game of mini-golf in a big, crazy city. Games are inventive and fun because the courses are so engaging/different. You can grab a drink before you play a round, though you cannot drink on the course.

Appetizers here are delicious and heart-attacking inducing. I'd suggest coming on a Monday or Tuesday because the rest of the week gets so busy/crowded that it takes away some of the fun.<//Text>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>This is such a great concept to have a putt putt golf area surrounded by bar stools and long tables cap ended by the bar. Parents can choose to play putt putt with the kiddos or just sit at the tables and have some drinks and watch their kids play.
You can order some food from the restaurant upstairs.
The putt putt has some very creative, unique holes with the shaking, earthquake simulating San Fran skyline on the first hole to the cool fluorescent ball in a dark setup on holes 9/10.
Good place for a fun evening< /Review><pics>None</pics>< response>

Pleasant surprise. Unassuming building, inside is a mix of historic building interior and imaginative  themes, think steampunk.  This is no ordinary indoor putting.  Can get crowded easily.  Food is good
Bar is stocked.  Awesome company group activity place during the day.< /text>

Me and my fiancé went to San Francisco for our week vacation and this is one of the spot we came across to do list. Best advice come early because it gets crowded in a hurry. The good thing about this place is that while it’s busy you can have your drinks while waiting in line (also you can bring your drinks while you are playing of the mini golf is a plus) if you decided to order they give you a tag and deliver your food while you are playing. So all and all it was great experience for us very neat for a couple or friends to go to cons would be it’s just tight space for that much crowd but hey I guess stay back and drink some more😉<//review>

Urban Putt delivers 14 holes of fun, which took my group about an hour to complete.  Not all of the holes are traditional; all holes are decorated in their own theme.  Such a great way to have fun with friends in the City!</Text>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>We ate at the restaurant thats located upstairs from the putt putt. I ordered the fried goat cheese salad and the fried olives appetizer. Everything tasted great. The olives had a little kick from the jalapenos. The salad had a delicious vinaigrette and the fried goat cheese was amazing. There was a full bar but I don't drink so I can't really comment on the cocktails.
After dinner we went down to play a round of putt putt. It was super fun, you can order drinks and take them with you as you play. The holes are all designed by local artists and are either San Francisco themed or just really original. And the price to play was relatively cheap too.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1497649393901, 'text': "Thanks so much for leaving such a great review for us  across platforms, Z!

Really great idea and fun time but you feel very rushed like someone is on your back. I was the last putter in my group so I rarely got to line up my shot without feeling the glares from behind.

I love this place! It's fun and the bar food is pretty delicious! I feel like the mini golf course is reasonable in price and the "obstacles" are quirky just like The City itself.  There is a wide selection of bar food available and they have a full restaurant upstairs though I didn't end up having dinner there.  The bar is kind of small but that's not the focus of this place.<//text>

This is a very fun little indoor mini-golf course and bar. The each hole of the course is uniquely designed and crafted and really a lot of fun. The bar had a decent selection. When I went you weren't allowed to bring alcohol on to the course part which was disappointing, hopefully they changed/change that!</Review>

Urban Putt is like a playground for adults! Great for a small group of friends after work or just an outing or for a date. There are 14 golf courses and each of the courses have something unique, different and beautifully designed. Alcohol on the courses are currently not allowed. They are in the process of getting a license for it. Only groups of 4 are allowed at each course. So, you + 3 of your friends would be perfect! There wouldn't be much of a long wait in line as well the wait on the course.

I suggest going there exactly at 4 pm or close to closing time which would avoid the super long lines. Word on the street is to go on the weekdays because there wouldn't be much of wait. However, when my friends and I showed up on a Thursday, there was a line wrapped around the block before the doors were open. Order drinks and wait in line. In no time, it'll be your turn. Down your drink because you won't be able to bring it on the course.< /Text>
<resp>{'time': 1414612039721, 'text': 'Hey there, Kath. I\'m glad to hear you loved the course! The word on the street is accurate -- yet, you still have to make it right around 8 to avoid the lines. There is a much shorter wait around those times, but it\'s a different crowd Monday - Wednesday. Also, we did get that special permission from the city, but when we tried out drinks on the course, it was a mess with longer waits and lots of spills. It\'s a highly debated topic among our staff, but for now, we\'re still holding up our "no drinks on the course" policy. We\'re working on ways to make this work, though! I know how fun it will be to sip and putt! Hope to see you back soon, Steve, Chief Greenskeeper'}</resp><GmapID>0x808f7e38e7b22169:0x4cdb309320bb79d< /GmapID><rate>5<//rate>< time>

We played Minigolf for about an hour, it's allowed to take drinks on the course.
After finishing the course, we got another round of drinks at the bar.

The mini golf course had some creative mechanical courses. Not sure if they already do this, but I hope they will change up the course over time to keep the experience new.

<review>I wasn't all that impressed to be honest. If you go during a primetime, expect to spend as much time waiting as you do golfing. Here's the kicker. No drinks on the course. You read that correctly. You drink while waiting then you're hung out to dry when it comes to getting on. Only on slow days do they allow drinking on the course. What's golf without having a cocktail or two?!
The one plus was that the food was pretty good, and relatively quick. Once the course allows a drink, or even develops a "drink attendant", can't justify more than 3 stars.<//review></record></dataset><record>

Awesome San Francisco themed indoor mini-golf. There are only 14 holes but they are fun and sometime unorthodox like a video game one or a hand controlled labyrinth. The bar has great cocktails and snack. There are also some games like skeeball and hoop fever.<//review>

A different and fun thing to do in the city on a weekend. If you're tired of simply going to bars every weekend this is a great spot. They have a bar and a very unique mini golf course to play. The pricing is reasonable and they course has awesome effects and obstacles. Unfortunately, there is no alcohol allowed on the course yet but they are working to change that!< /review>

So much fun! It's a 13 hole SF Themed miniature golf complex that you can get through within an hour.  The best time to go is during the week in the evenings.  Don't bother trying to go during the weekend as the lines are long.  They also have full bar and delicious appetizers.  Get the Chicken and Waffle skewers and deviled eggs.

There is a separate Restaurant section if you just want to sit down for lunch/dinner as well.< /review>

Coming from a southerner this place has some of the best chicken and waffles I have had since coming to the bay area.
For 8 bucks you get 3 skewers of waffle and chicken. Well worth the cash.<//Review>

<user_name>Andrea Espejel</user_name><Review>Nice place in the middle of the city. This is an old house made into a mini golf & restaurant.

It is a good place to spend some time with friends or family, but there are no more options than just the mini golf.

The only thing that sucks is that at the bar you need to buy 2 drinks if you want to pay with card and a minimun of $15 USD. Wich sucks because I don't drink, my husband only got 1 beer, and they made us ask for another beer we ended up giving away so they could charge the $15 USD . ($15 + tip)

It's a bit expensive, they charge $12 USD each person and 1 hole was closed when I visited (june 2019).</Review><Rate>4</Rate>< GmapID>

<Text>I came here once on date night with my wife, and another time with my company for a work event.

This place has decent food, a good taplist, and boozy drinks. Oh..right...and an indoor mini golf course.

The golf course is fun and laid back. Some of the holes are pretty unique. Everything is a lot more fun when you get to walk around with a beer in your hand.</Text>< date>

<text>literally obsessed with this place! Perfect for anyone of all ages- especially over 21 because you can drink! It's a mini golf bar, reasonable prices, and SO much fun. Whenever anyone new comes to SF I take them here! You can drink on the course on Mondays. Also- cheeky trick, get extra rounds in by not doing the last hole which swallows up your ball. Just go straight back to the first one again!<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<Review>Food was really good and the course was fun. My only complaint is that the space is pretty small and the holes can be really really long in terms of the time it takes to complete them. There are at least 4 holes with tube goldberg-like contraptions that last at least a minute and if the place is packed it can really add up, not to mention my ball disappeared inside two of them(the broken windmill and the gold rush holes).

My wife and I spent over 10 minutes on two occassions waiting between holes cause the parties(4 and 3 people) ahead of us played the hole like it was supposed to be played. This is mini golf not real golf, people shouldn't feel pressured to let others play ahead or play faster just because the course literally requires you to watch your ball traverse a half mile of track just for you to tap it in when it's done.

With drinks and a packed house be prepared to get hot. There isn't a lot of room between holes and the back area can get very crowded.

Overall I enjoyed it and if I went again it would be when it's significantly less busy.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

Very innovative mini golf course that artistically showcases lots of local sites. Their cocktail selection is quite decent, but they don't really have any vegan food options other than fries.< /Text>

<Text>Really fun place. You can tell a lot of first dates are happening here. And why not?? It's ideal! Especially if you're a non drinker, though it DOES have a full bar if you are. Some light sharing bar snacks too, but nothing like a full sit down dinner.

<review>A great activity whether for 2 or a group! There's 14 holes with some of coolest and most intricate feats of mini-putting engineering. A full bar and restaurant is available if you want to make a full night of the event. There is going to be a line after 6:30pm, especially on weekends, and it's 21+ only after 8pm. Grab a beer and wait in line, it's worth it.</review>< user_name>

Great space and innovative concept. Food and drinks were both good. Try the chicken & waffles! The mini golf on the first floor is fun, but can get kinda crowded. I loved the creativity behind all of the mini golf holes. Some holes took a lot longer, so there's a bit of a wait for them. The second floor is spacious, with its own bar and several TVs.

The only drawbacks were we couldn't carry our drinks onto the course and no place to hang our jackets.

Would def come back for food and drinks, or on a less busy night for mini golf.<//review>

I would've given 5 stars if it weren't for 2 reasons: the place was crowded with no time slots so you end waiting for a bit until someone finishes the hole and second reason being I haven't tried their bar yet. An excellent place to spend time with friends or a date. Looks more like a Maker style venue. The contraptions and holes are well thought out and a lot of fun. The most interesting of all is probably the labyrinth. There are some tricky ones too but all fun though. Go ahead and grab a few friends or your date and head on over there for a fun evening trying to sink the golf ball hitting par while navigating the SF scenery in miniature mode.< /Text>

Freakin' incredible. The city is in dire need of fun hangouts like Urban Putt. I was blown away by the 14 holes carefully assembled into this corner building. The designers went above and beyond, replicating landmarks around SF in miniature form for the course. Best of all, they serve booze. God, what else could you ask for?< /text>

< Review>
12 dollars will get you a very unique SF experience. We arrived on a Saturday night around 9 and we were told there was "a line for the line" and it would take about an hour. The 40 minutes that it took to get on the course flew by as we sipped on some dogfish head from the bar and played a really cool game in line (you'll see). Go with a group of friends or a date; it's only 4 per hole at a time, but if you go when it's busy it'll be a line of people moving through anyway. Worth the wait if you've never done it, I'll be bringing some other first timers here in the future.<//Review>

<text>Fun indoor putt putt for $12/person that will probably take 30-45m for the whole (very creatively done) course. Didn't check out the upstairs, but the front bar has moscow mules and a unique old fashioned on tap!

Visited on Tuesday around 6pm, was able to do a leisurely full round of golf with no/minimal wait.

You can only drink ON the course on Mondays, otherwise get your drinks in before you putt.< /text><user>112161855405573529823< /user><Rate>5</Rate>< username>

Every hole was like a Rube Goldberg contraption, and made the most out of the tiny footprint.  My reason for the three stars was the crowd within the course.  We were constantly tripping over each other,  and there were times where we had zero personal space.  Add in alcohol and you get the picture.  We are going to try this place again, but at an earlier hour to avoid the drunks.<//Review>< user_name>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>Great concept, Great Price and a ton of fun,  This place is pretty new and the crowds show what a great place this is to relax on a Friday afternoon with a delicious drink in hand.  The putt putt course is very fun and they have a game room with SkeeBall and Basketball Pop-a-shot.  They also have a full service restaurant and the menu looks and sounds delicious.  Service was top notch and you can't tell this place has only been around a few months.  I hope they are able to succeed and be a staple happy hour spot in SF for years to come.< /text>< pics>

Really fun place to spend a night with a group of friends. There's a bar with a lot of good beers on tap and they make good cocktails as well. Unfortunately you can't bring drinks onto the course, but I suppose they're just trying to avoid spills. The course is varied and fun, and I was impressed by how much they were able to do with the space.</review>

Came here on my birthday but it was Closed for a private function. We only found out when we arrived, and there was a sign on the door. The place was empty. It'd be great if there was a more reliable notification system. It definitely affected my night.< /review>

Top 10 places I take people when they visit SF. THey also have surprisingly good cocktails and and upstairs eatery that isn’t half bad.<//Review>< UserId.>

<review>This place is so cool. Make sure you go on a night that you can drink on the course. It is mini golf, but it's not cheezy cheap stuff. The courses are thoughtfully made and some are very though provoking. It's a short course but I think it's worth it!<//review>< Pictures>

Urban Putt is a restaurant, bar, and miniature golf place built into a renovated building.  The food at the restaurant was surprisingly good.  The miniature golf involves creative holes, but it is rather small and can get crowded.< /review>

<Review>Decided to go there with my brother since we were in the mission area. It was certainly entertaining but based on what I saw online I thought we'd spend a few hours here, but we were bored within the hour. What was most disappointing were the cocktails. They were expensive (~$12) but pre-mixed and poorly made.< /Review><name>Dilip Ramachandran<//name>< rating>

I grew up playing lots of miniature golf.  In college we use to buy best player dinner.  Now this is a great twist to the game.  Indoor gold with food and drinks.  Note you can't bring food or drinks onto the course.

There's a total of 14 holes, each one with their own theme, but many related to the bay area.  Some courses have a tricky shot, but you can always take the long way around the obstacle, but if you get pass, you can cut your strokes down.

They also have rooms for private events and a restaurant upstairs.  It gets crazy busy at 7:30ish.  A line forms for just by the bar to get on the course.  If you can, try to start your game by 7:00.</Text>

<Text>I probably would have had more fun if the drunkies in front of my group were less drunk and didn't keep trying to involve us in their family drama. Otherwise, food was just ok and pretty expensive. Drinks were meh. The course is probably a lot of fun when it's less crowded and there is less pressure to keep moving .</Text>< pictures>

So many extra unnecessary devices in place, when all you really need it to do is perform a simple task, like thanking someone for playing minigolf.

<Text>An interesting take on mini golf. They're definitely not afraid to take risks on unusual concepts and that can be good and bad. Some features are wildly entertaining and beg to be played again and again. Others are boring or simply don't work. The experience as a whole though is very unique. Can't help but recommend.< /Text>< pics>

It’s a great place if you’re looking to waste a little time while getting wasted.  When putting (no pun intended) a usually outdoor activity indoors in a city filled with alternative options, please step it up a notch.  Urban Putt should step it up 3.</Review>

Fun and creative miniature golf spot. Great for date night or just hanging out with friends.
The food is good, prices are reasonable and there are nice bonuses in the back such as wack-a-mole table game.< /review>

< Review>
I chose this place to meet with my friends for my birthday because I've heard good things and it was only $12 per person.  Every employee I ran into was friendly and helpful, from the women checking IDs at the door to the woman handling the transactions.

The putting area was so much fun!  Each hole has a unique San Francisco theme.  I'm not going to spoil the surprise by describing each one.  And Googling pictures won't help you.  You just have to see them for yourself!

The only criticism I have is crowd control.  The bar is across the entrance to the putting area, so it gets confusing.  I didn't know which line to stand in as they started to converge.  Also, there is seating area to the side of the putting area if you want to drink and observe.  But if you're sitting there and the line gets longer, you end up with people trying to maneuver behind you and it can get frustrating.  Also, there's no more than 4 people per hole, so if a golfer's game isn't up to par, or if there's a large group of people ahead, it can get backed up.  I'm not sure what the solution would be, because I also don't think people should feel rushed.

So if you're planning on going on a Friday or Saturday night, just be prepared with a lot of patience.

And before you leave, check out the art installation by the golf clubs.  It's interactive and must be done a couple of times just because!< /Review>

Extremely crowded, but still fun. There's a separate bar area where you can get drinks and food, which aren't allowed in the putt putt area itself. Worthwhile to stand in line with a drink until you're up to putt.<//review>

This is a good way to play and enjoy with friends while drinking your fave booz. The restaurant upstairs also offer good food at reasonable price. No need to reserve if you're playing on a weekday. But it can get pretty full on weekends. Situated on 24th mission, you can easily find the place if you take the bart and walk 5 minutes from station.< /Text>

The steampunk style and kickstarter vibe pulled me in, but the creative putt putt holes and the delicious bar bites brought it home. There aren't a ton of holes here like an outdoor mini-golf place, but these have more character and variations than any mini-golf course you've ever tried.< /Review>

Fun fact: each hole was designed by a different local artist to reflect a unique part of San Francisco's vast and interesting history. As for the food and drink, I'll just say that we have some of the best folks around working in our kitchen and behind the bar.

<review>Mortuary converted into a unique mini golf course. Not your standard, suburban course, it's very compact, features incredibly detailed construction, Rube Goldberg machines for transporting balls, and a ball race. Fancy and delicious but pricy cocktails. Good appetizers including chicken & waffles, & grilled cheese, but the bechamel sauce pizza was too gooey.</review>< username>

Coming into Urban Putt, you can tell that they put a lot of thought and details into the design of the place. I haven't been upstairs, but I think that area is for dining. But downstairs is where all the action is at. They have a room with some mini games, a photo booth, but the money is on the mini golf course/bar.

We had to wait in line, to get into a line! Haha, that sounds ridiculous right? On a Saturday, we waited around 1 hour for a party of 3. I wish that the place was slightly bigger, I was often bumping into people, but that's not really a big deal. Urban Putt is a really fun place to be, you can bring a date, people from out of town or whatever - you won't be disappointed :-)

P.S. They use banana chips for their guacamole dip so don't miss out on that!<//Text>

It only has 14 holes.  But for 2 people only $24 (12 a pop) it was a good time.  Small holes, granted it's inside so i think that is to be expected.<//Text>

<review>Great vibe wish we could have golfed but we had the baby. We really liked the chicken and waffle sliders. I had the flank steak. the idea of the meal was on point with the parsnip puree and stuffed artichoke, doesnt that just sound delicious! Unfortunately it just didn't hit the spot there was no life to the meal. It needed something... Hubby had the sausage pizza which i really enjoyed the crust but the ingredients were limp. I dont know what it was about this food bit it felt like a swing and a miss. I mean it was edible and i really couldn't complain but I was missing something.</review>< pictures>

Odd mix of mini golf, cocktails, and unexpectedly good food and service in a converted Victorian that's also family friendly (for those with older kids).</text>

Food and fun all in one place! Dinner is on the expensive side, but what isn't in the city? Indoor mini golf is fun but the holes aren't exactly laid out well. Many holes there tends to be congestion waiting for the next.<//Text>

Great beer and they even go to some length to idiot-proof the golf course, which didn't stop my drunk ass from trying to drive a ball through the wall but I appreciate them not kicking me out.</Text>

If this indoor putt-putt​ golf course were a math equation it would be Rube Goldberg x Willy Wonka + Exploratorium  Disney ÷ Steampunk  Guillermo Del Toro = Urban Putt.

Yes, it gets very crowded & you may have to wait to tee off BUT fear not adults as they feature an expertly crafted full bar with a cocktail menu (plus beer & wine) to match the equally creative course. Oh and they do have some damn tasty vittles to keep your backswing fully powered Tiger (bar bites to full entrees).

Also great for kids...but super duper crowded in a very tight space so parents beware.

Open @ 4pm weekdays & 11am weekend.

Admission:
Kids under 5 = free
6-12 = $8
13 & Up = $12

They host tons of private events & parties so best to check before you get your knickers & argyle on.

Great date night spot even with the wait for the mini golf course (which is unlike any other course you'll play).  The food is average and you unfortunately cannot have a beer while you putt but if indoor mini golf is what you're after this is your place.</Review>

5 Stars because of me being a cynic. This is downstairs bar and golf, no upstairs info from my end....

Gastropub comfort food that will eventually kill you, but for the night it was delightful. Corn Dogs, Soft Pretzels, Deep Dish Pizza (this was meh, fine, okay, but don't come looking for solid DD). Mostly expect deep fried things.

As a boozer, I get irate with wine and beer only places, so 5 stars in lieu of that is a happy recommendation.  They always have lovely sparkling bubbles.

No booze allowed on the course yet due to awesomely complex and obscure permitting issues, but it did seem a beer or two snuck their way on the course from time to time.  The food felt like I was at a fair - delicious gut bombs that you pay for, later.

But the course is really special. I thought it would be a stupid hipster event that was awful. And yes... the line and wait is awful. But the course itself is sheer brilliance... 14 creative and artistic holes in a tiny space, that were designed with an obviously non-ironic and profound sense of love, experimentation, and fun.  This was not dialed in, phoned in, or any of that. It is a cute, engaging, enjoyable, imaginative and fun time in SF.

Enjoy.<//Text>

The putt putt was packed on a Saturday night so we didn't try to play.  But our group enjoyed ourselves in the side room with basketball and skeeball.<//Text>

<Rating>4< /Rating><text>Ah, Urban Putt. A sanctuary for playing your favorite childhood activity and an adult, where you an scarf down some grub and embellish yourself with one of many classy cocktails or humble beers on the drink menu. Don't be off-put by the long lines seen from the door, as the slight intimidation of the Door Guard will dissipate as you hear him chuckle about the shenanigans he sees on a friday night.

I ventured in here for a work event and brought my beautiful fiance. Our doggy Charlie stayed home as all the hussle and bussle of this lively happenin' place would frighten the little pup.

The lines move quick. We played some Ski-Ball before our tournament and choose one of the wild neon colored balls. A bit of foreshadowing, because to our pleasant surprise, they actually glowed in the dark! Just a little hint for you curious guides!

There is a chart to choose the correct club length! Make sure you do this or else all your friends will laugh as you crouch over a stick that is way too short! Just a heads up as my fiance chose a stick that was too long and we traded.

The mini golf holes inside this wonderful nostalgic victorian home are just as creative as the place itself. Mini scenes from San Fran adorn all of the course and leave you mesmerized with Rube Goldberg type devices. We won't spoil it for you as this place is a MUST visit.

The lines move quick. Everyone is pretty respectful, and our only complaint comes from the crowd of slightly-too-buzzed tech workers that kept hitting their ball into other courses and ruining our game. It would have been forgivable if they didn't further this behavior in other places like loud drunken chats in the bathroom and halls. My fiance didn't really approve of her experience with a few patrons, but don't be alarmed - Urban Putt lives up to all the hype!

Next time we go when my fiance's sister is in town we will definitely go when Google says it isnt too busy and show her a little Frisco fun!

Urban Putt is a creative, adult playground with all you could want. Make sure you go when it is slow. Thanks, good peoples!<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Time it well, and you could have free reign over this place. Its a great spot, can get majorly packed during rush hours. Also gets very tight in a few spots. Other than that, its a must do!<//Review>

Great place to spend a couple of hours - can get a little crowded at the weekend and there may be a wait to start the 'course' but nice that you can grab a drink from the bar to keep you occupied!</Review>

In my case it was a fun group outing. My friends and I were around the area and couldn't help but stop by to check this place out. It's a mini golf, restaurant, and bar all in one! You can eat, grab some drinks, and mini golf all under one roof! How awesome is that?!

It gets pretty packed but the place is pretty big. The second level is the restaurant, and the first level is the mini golf area. Both levels have a bar but the one on the first level is bigger and has more drink selections (beers on tap). The mini golf area contains 14 holes all jammed up on the first floor. They get pretty creative with the hole designs since space is limited and it was fun to go through all of them. They get major props for decorations and everything! It costs about $12 dollars to play which isn't bad. There isn't any drinking allowed during golfing so drink up before or afterwards. The line can get pretty backed up for the holes since a lot of people play but it's still fun. The crowd is pretty lively and cheerful.

It was a fun experience and I wouldn't mind going back. The convenience is really what gets me, you don't have to leave to get a drink or food :D Definitely something you should check out if you're ever in the area and looking to have a swingin' night ;) ( I just can't help being punny )<//text>< user_name>

One of the best, compact miniature golf courses you'll ever play. Top-notch design elements and theming. Lots of rube golderg type contraptions on the back-half of course to extend gameplay - feels gimmicky sometimes but is genuinely entertaining overall.

As an added bonus, you can take your drink on the course now.

Bar has ready-to-serve margheritas and good beer/cocktail selection. The food is way above average - highly recommend the chicken-and-waffles and grilled cheese w/ tomato soup. To top it all off, they have Straus soft-serve for dessert.<//text>

The bar and mini golf downstairs was great, but the service and food at the restaurant upstairs was super disappointing. Mini golf gets really crowded sometimes, so it's better to go early in the week (Mon-Wed)< /text>

Pretty neat place! Too bad you can't bring your beverages inside the minigolf course, so, I suggest you drink enough to get a good buzz and play minigolf! Each hole is unique and my friend and I were snapping pictures left and right. My favorite was hole 9, Dia de los muertos. When you come, you'll find out why. I definitely think you should check it out. It's super cool and fun! Urban Putt also has a mini arcade with mini hoops, skeeball and a few others. In my opinion, those games are the best!

Lastly, the beer menu ranges from light to dark with various beers on tap. The bar menu wasn't extensive and we ordered fried green olives with goat cheese and jalapenos. The burger looked good and we saw many others order it too.

I'd come back again and a neat place for everyone of all ages!<//review>

<Text>I went here for a first date and it is perfect for that - provides a fun experience that you can enjoy so you don't spend the whole time trying to think what to say.

Plusses:
- The course is really creative and uses scenes from around San Francisco (including little buildings that shake as though there is an earthquake, and a pretty cool Dia de Los Muertos display)
- It's not too crowded even though it's a putt putt course in a bar
- It's clean and well kept up
- It's a fun, young crowd for the most part (some families but not after 8pm)
- They've been creative about drinks despite lacking their liquor license - lots of fun beer/wine based choices that are pretty good
- There is Skeeball in the back room
- The holes are challenging but not so much that you can't move through pretty quickly

Minuses:
- The line will be long. Just have to deal with it
- They lack their liquor license (at the moment)
- The food, which I did not try, looked iffy. Like pizza was largely a slab of cheese melted on top of a hunk of bread. Truly gross looking - again, I didn't taste it, but didn't seem like what you wanted, and it's unfortunate as they're in a neighborhood where you expect good food.

A couple of pro tips for you -- If you want to miss the crowd, let me suggest coming in Saturday early in the day (we open at 11), or anytime on Sunday (open at 11), or Monday (open at 4 pm). Unfortunately, we've found that allowing drinks on the course can slow the golfing down to an absolute crawl. The good news: We do allow liquor on the course on Mondays, when we have fewer folks on the course. That said, I hope you'll come check us out during one of these times, and I appreciate the feedback! -Yours in Minigolf, Steve, Chief Greenskeeper"}</Resp><gmap_id>0x808f7e38e7b22169:0x4cdb309320bb79d< /gmap_id></record>

Frankly, I was surprised to learn you thought our course was poorly designed, because we almost always get high grades there. But one person's gem is another's unadulterated garbage, and I have always believed that diversity of opinion is a good thing. If you do have a hankering for mini-golf in San Francisco, you might want to check out Stagecoach Greens, an outdoor mini-golf course  in Mission Bay. -Steve, Chief Greenskeeper"}< /resp>< user_name>
