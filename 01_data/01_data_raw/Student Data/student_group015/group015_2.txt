<review>Vince was really helpful in helping me find high quality coins for a great price.  He took his time with me and looked at each coin I chose and I am very happy with my experience.  Will definitely buy from again.  Thank you.<//review><Time>1614903034180< /Time><user_name>Anita Rich< /user_name>< pictures>

Incredibly rude. I was berated for not making an appointment beforehand, even though nowhere on the website said by appointment only. I did try calling the week prior to confirm store hours but no one picked up the phone.

I went in to see if I could sell a few coins and get an opinion of whether another coin was worth sending in for grading. I was told unless I had bought the coins from him he had no interest in buying since the coins had little resale value. Fair enough, but he asked how I came to own them and expressed great skepticism when I told him, as if I had stolen them.

I asked for his opinion on the coin I was thinking of getting graded, he looked at it for 5 seconds without even inspecting it and told me it was fake. After I explained I had bought it from a reputable Bay Area dealer then his tune changed.

Overall, the experience was so unpleasant that a lady who was dining outside with her friends and overheard the entire conversation actually stopped me as I was leaving and referred me to another coin shop nearby.</Text>

I had a great experience with Vince and Sal!  My father, a long-time coin and antique collector, recently passed away, leaving behind his beloved collection.  I wanted to start offloading some of it, so I called Falcone Coins and spoke with Vince.  He told me things to look out for on the coins to determine if they were valuable and said that I could send him a list of what I was looking to sell as well as some pictures.  I made an appointment to come in later that week and met with Vince and his father.

I came in somewhat prepared, with a list of what I had and what I thought they may be worth, based on similar eBay listings.  Vince and his dad went through each item and told me what they'd be willing to pay, with absolutely no pressure.  Don't expect their prices to match the highest prices you may see online, but keep in mind, auction sites take a large commission and entail a lot of work.  For as quick and efficient as the process was, I thought their offers were incredibly fair/generous.  I had a few pieces of gold jewelry, which Sal took the time to test and weigh to give me a fair price.  He even suggested that I keep a nice, personalized gold charm bracelet, unless I really needed the money.  I probably brought in a few too many items though, because I started to lose track of what I agreed to sell versus keep.

To my pleasant surprise though, a few weeks later, I received an e-mail from Vince to let me know that his dad spent more time looking at the coins that he bought from me and noticed that one was more valuable than he had originally noticed.  He had me come back to the shop to give me $300.  What an awesome, honest gesture!

I would recommend this place to anyone looking to sell coins, silver, jewelry, etc!  My advice is to do a little research about the stuff you have before you come in - that way you can easily accept or turn down their offers.  If you have something they don't want to buy, don't take it personally.  If you call and feel like Vince is being short on the phone, it's just because they are very busy and trying to help lots of people.  Both of the times I came in, their phone was constantly ringing, but they made sure to answer every call.  Looking forward to going back soon to sell some more things!< /Text>

I'm recently getting into collecting silver coins and I was directed to go to Falcone jewelry and coins Inc. There I met the owner Vince who showed me what to look for and how much silver bars and coins cost. I had already gone to a few pawn shops, but if I had to do it over again I would have gone straight to Vince because he was more knowledgeable and trustworthy than the others. I highly recommend Falcone's jewelry and coins, not only to my friends and family but to others. Keep up the great service!!<//text>

<pictures>None<//pictures><text>We stopped by to find out the sell value of some gold coins we have. I'm not a coin collector, but did some research online ahead of time. Vince met with us at no charge, and went through each coin. Because they were not in uncirculated condition, most weren't of any collector value. But, he was very honest and used an exact algorithm to tell us what he would pay for it. No shenanigans! He even recommended that we hold onto it, if we didn't need the money right now, because he suspected the price of gold would continue to go up.

Plus, there was a dog. Sweet, big, brown dog. That makes every place better. :-)<//text><gmap_id>0x808e33584993560d:0x3fb09ccdb6db9c1c</gmap_id>< Rate>

<Review>This is a great place to go if you have collectible coins or other collectibles. The negative reviews are probably just from people who thought their junk was worth something.
had a very diverse collection of coins that my grandfather had collected and left to my mom. Everything from gold coins to silver dollars, mint and proof sets and some commemorative coins. A little bit of everything. Vince spent 2 hours helping me amid interruptions from crazy street people and scammers.
Vince gave a very fair price and we sold him everything except a few things he said we should just spend or keep.
Especially nice when an old lady and her daughter came in with her 'collection' Vince patiently explained what they had and bought a few coins and sent them happily on their way.
If we find more of grandpa's coins I will be back.
Thanks Vince!< /Review>< Gmap_id>

Great little shop to visit, I was looking for a couple walking halves. He let me and a buddy look through his whole stock!

We got to choose our favorites and walked out with a great deal.

If you know what you are looking for, give him a days heads up and he can arrange it for you.< /review>

This shop is outstanding. They took the time to explain all of the different options with the coins and bullion. The customer service is fantastic. These people are a pleasure to do business with. They care about their customers. I never felt any pressure to buy anything. They are extremely knowledgeable and very helpful. I wish there were more family run places like this. This the only place I shop for my coins. I can not say enough great things about his family.</review>

Excellent coins and great customer service. Coins are priced fairly and the owner is very helpful. Much better than any other coin shop near by.< /Review>

Sal was a gem. I had a ton of coins to sell, and he spent hours with me, pricing everything out. His prices were 20% higher then San Jose Coin Shop, and he was friendly to everyone that walked in. His wife Barbara was very helpful and friendly as well.

And "Duke" was the friendliest soul in the shop:)<//review>

The only reason, I didnt score this place any higher than 1 is due to the service. I like Sal a whole lot, but Vince can turn a pleasant experience into a sour one. Sal spends his time to build relationships with his customers; while Vince just wants to make a quick buck.I hope Sal will be around for a long time, because I sure hope I never have to deal with Vince.< /text>

You had nothing but smiles in the video footage AND we even gave your two kids FREE TOYS!!  Your kids had a great time petting my black lab Duke as well.......from watching the video footage it is hard for me to see how we were rude to you.....are you mixing us up with another coin shop you went to that day?  Anyway sorry you had a bad experience.....let us know if we can assist you in any other way and we will do our best once again to make it a positive experience.....good luck to you  ~Falcone Coins"}< /Resp>

The food was really good. I don't speak a lot of Spanish (almost the entire menu is written entirely in Spanish, and the staff predominantly speak Spanish), so that was a little bit of a hurdle - but the payout was fine. All the meat was tender and well seasoned, everything was made fresh and delivered piping hot, and everyone was really friendly. It's a nice little place worth checking out.<//Review>

The food is great!!. BUT the only reason why I don't give it 5 stars is because the service is not that great. Even though they serve you fast, the ladies working there always seem to be mad when they're taking your order. Also, a nice welcome greeting and and a smile would make a lot of difference.< /Review>

< review>
It's divey, casual, and I had to swat away a large mosquito since I was sitting next to a large open window but the FOOD shined.

I got the Caldo de Camaron (Shrimp soup) and a Rebueltas Pupusa. I didn't realize the soup also came with 2 thick tortillas and a plate of mixed rice so it obviously became too much food for me.

But the important part was the soup with the huge shrimp and the cheesy pupusa, which came with a jar of pickled veggies that cut down the richness and went well with everything. It was SO satisfying. The soup was creamy, had large chunks of veggies, and juicy shrimp. Definitely a winner.

Would love to come back to try more different soups, pupusas and maybe the breakfast!</review>

What a gem! Pupusas in many delicious flavors with El Salvadorian salsas to add even more flavor. I stumbled across this place 10 years ago as I was working a contract not too far away. Worth a drive.< /text>

The pupusas are good. The horchata was disappointing. I find the other dishes I've tried to be too salty.</Text>

Second favorite place to eat pupusas. They have a variety of options. I love their cheese flan. Only thing, service isnt the greatest and since they have an open air kitchen the whole place gets really friggn hot.< /Review>

Their pupusas were big! I underestimated how big they would be. I'm a little disappointed in how watered down their salsa was. I enjoyed their bean and cheese pupusas more than I did their revueltos and that's kind of disappointing. My boyfriend had a burrito de asada and he says it wasn't anything special, but not in a disappointing way. Burritos are good.< /text>

Don't shop here too often, but they had what I was looking for so that was a good thing. It was a bit overpriced but I didn't want to keep driving around to other stores so it is what it is.<//Text>

< Review>
Everything in this store is expired or old as hell. The shelves are dusty and sticky. And absolutely every single thing in here is way overpriced. It's like they're trying to insult people.  Every single time we go we get different treatment because there are like 7 different people behind the counter so sometimes they will discount things that have no business being so expensive, but most of the time they charge shamelessly.

Me and my husband have vowed never to come back. They clearly are only interested in taking advantage of the convenient location.</Review>

Claimed that they would cash my check. Just had to wait for a certain employee. They would tell me when he's supposed to be in and never was.  2 weeks go by and finally I catch him. Forgets that he said he would and reverts to the policy that everyone else told me about.< /Review>

<Rating>1< /Rating><text>Truly the worst garbage service I have ever experienced. Athens wont pick up extra trash bags because they were not in a trash can ....and they wont pick up my broken down boxes because they were not tied up......seriously you are trash company ....since when did I have to package my trash or tie them up in a bow....There answer was because their contract says they don't have too........when did common sense get thrown out the window?

The guy that delievered my trash cans was very friendly. He even told me about what bins to get when I clean out my garage. He put the trash bags in the trash cans for me. His name was Tony I have lived in Norwalk for over 2 years and never met a driver like him. You have a good employee in him Athens.</text>

<Review>Every time Athens comes to dump the trash from the apartments behind my house you guys litter my alley with trash. It goes in my backyard, my driveway, and all down the alley. When I asked your workers to clean it up they said "ok next time we will".
After I exchanged some "friendly" words with them, they cleaned up the trash that went everywhere from the dumpster.
You guys do this EVERY WEEK, but finally I was home to catch it on video.< /Review><GmapID>0x80c2d6ef811970cd:0xdc9dbea06d8437be< /GmapID>< rate>

If I had the opportunity to change Wast Management I would do it in snap.  It doesn't make sense that they would rent you a 3 yard Trash bin but you cant throw away broken furniture, I would have to rent a big bin to throw away a twin bed.   LOL    This company is full of garbage - literally!</Text>

We tore a number of medium-sized bushed out of our yard, placed them in a neat pile at the curb and called for a bulky item pickup. They were not picked up on the day scheduled, so we called to ask why. We were told it was because they weren't tied into 2x4 ft bundles. The bushes themselves are roughly 2x4 feet, and we were able to move the whole pile in about five minutes. But their precious pickup crew couldn't be bothered to throw them in a truck. Thanks, Athens. Worthless.</text>

We have lived in our home for 13 years and tree pickup has never been more difficult. Despite the fact that we’ve made 2 attempts to put the tree out during the pickup window, there were rules to cut the tree in half, must be placed out before 6am on the front lawn, or else it wouldn’t be picked up.</Review>

West Covina, Ordered a Ben (apartment size) rip off $179 wont take if over 300 lbs , won’t take furniture, wood, drywall etc, they say only house items, so we put house items and they say too heavy. And to remove half the contents. What is the point of ordering a Ben?< /Review>

We have never had a problem with them... actually, the drivers have been so amazing. My kids love when the trash gets picked up... probably because of the giant truck, but every time they rush out there, the driver greets them with a big smile and wave, and even sometimes a nice salutation... like recently, "Happy Thanksgiving." I can't say enough about these guys. I think most parents would agree that if someone can put a smile on your kids faces... they're worth something in my book. Great service and great people.

Athens also happens to be the provider to the City my two businesses are in also. Same level of service and great drivers as far as we are concerned. I would highly recommend these guys!</review><name>Charley Bell< /name>< Time>

This company owed us a 5 digit refund. After 6 months of follow up phone calls, they finally released our refund and still failed to send it to the appropriate address. I've been getting the typical generic apologies and company run around, and finally was able to speak with a supervisor who was still unable to help solve anything. Completely incompetent call center and accounting department.<//text>

<Review>Got a letter on April 13 (dated on April 11) saying that there is a delinquent balance. Had always been on Auto pay and paperless statement. Had no idea why/how this happened because never received a notification before this letter. Made a payment immediately, but they still suspended the service on April 15. Tried to call in to explain. They refused to admit there was a flaw in their payment/communication system, and refused to provide the service. Too bad it is a local monopoly and consumers don't have another option.</Review>< gmapID>

<Name>Cary Crosby< /Name><Rate>1<//Rate><text>As usual Athens has ridiculous customer service as they don't even have their rates available without putting you on hold fro 10 minutes.  I have been dealing with this company for too long, and unfortunately they really have no incentive to change as they bribe city officials into signing contracts that are essentially forever.  My house is in Monrovia, and Monrovia's City Hall cares more about business owners then it does the residents of the city.  That is why they give you no choice but to use Athens because Athens takes care of the city trash cans for free in exchange for being able to exploit the residents.  Kind of like a mafia family for trash companies, and they get to raise the rates 10% a year if they want.  If the city wants to cancel the contract that is okay, but they have to give a 15 year notice.  So if they cancel it now, then Athens is still around for another 15 years.< /text>< time>

Athens billing is off the chart the worst I have ever dealt with.  Consistently on-line bill pay payments are rejected with no reason, this is after 15 years of paying the bill this way. For the last year I have had 3 of the 4 payments get rejected, no notification that the payment was rejected, when you call then don't  have record of even receiving it to reject it. The CS staff has limited access to see the account and cannot resolve an issue if their life depended on it. Mailed statements are random arrivals. They say they are mailed on the 1st, but regularly get it 30- 45 days later.  To call and discuss anything, you are on hold for minimum of 30 mins or more, and don't even bother requesting a call back, it never happens.  I tried to set up an account on the website to pay the bill on-line since they stopped taking my bank bill pay, it was suppose to send a confirmation e-mail to activate the account, never received the email. I tried 3 more times to set it up, never received the confirmation to activate.  So,I have to "old school" mail my bill, until the day they claim they don't receive the mail too. I am already anticipating future issues, with payments. Its not a mater of if, but when.
The service it's self is mediocre at best. The trucks race from house to house, screeching brakes, and ogling drivers. I can't tell you how many times I have seen a driver idle to watch woman walk by. I had a guy this week, stay in front of my house trying  to look in my window to watch me workout.   They are messy with trash pick ups,  usually leaving debris all over the street, and enviably the cans don't get placed back upright, they are knocked over into yards and flower beds as the race off to the next house. I wish Covina offered other services providers because Athens is truly garbage.  PUN INTENDED!< /text>

Customer follow through is horrific.  Spent each of the last 4 business days trying to get my dumpster dumped.  Every day I'm told they will be out to dump my missed day and they never show.  Office staff is great at saying what you want to hear.  But nothing ever happens.  But if I need an extra pick-up which would cost extra they'll be right away.  I wish there was a way to hire a different company.  Unfortunately Covina has a contract so I'm stuck.</Review>

Delivered on time.  Delivery man did a wonderful job of getting it in my driveway, which is not totally level.  Picked up on time as promised - all-in-all an easy and convenient experience. Will not hesitate to utilize again.<//review>

They consistently miss pick ups. Their phone customer service is great, but it doesn't mean anything since they remotely send messages to the dispatchers that seem to have no control over the drivers. When they do miss pick ups they don't pick up any trash left behind by the overflowing of the trash that was caused by them not picking up in the first place. They used to be really good, but now it's difficult to get them to show up for their three schedules days, but you better believe that they still charge you for it.<//Text>

I manage an apartment building in Norwalk, which just signed an exclusive contract with Athens, and my bill went up 27% for the same service on the first bill. I called to ask why the sharp increase and was told that it's non-negotiable. They also said the previous trash service (Republic) hadn't done rate increases for years, which was apparently a justification for them to jack my rate up so high. And of course the contract is "exclusive" so I can't shop around for a better deal.

I guess my frustration should be pointed at the City Council for signing an exclusive contract with such an unscrupulous company.<//Text>

< Review>
I was out running errands this morning in a neighborhood where the speed limit is 15mph and twice encountered a red Athens truck (the kind that carries single dumpsters) speeding around blind corners. I was shocked the first time and angry the second time. I called to complain and encountered a phone labyrinth. Looking at the other reviews here I'm starting to realize that exclusive service contracts are a serious issue. We need to figure something out.< /Review>

<review>To this company service absolutely does not mean anything but collecting your money. They charge you in advance for three months of service which you don't get. Their service fees have increased by more than 50% in the last couple of years and  they don't even bother to pick up your trash. They don't even deserve  one star. Somebody  (or somebodies) at City of Monrovia must have been getting pretty rich to keep giving this company trash collection contract for the city.</review></record></dataset><record>

<review>I'm a onsite property manager in charge of 45 condominiums.Previously,our building was with NASA trash services and they were fantastic.The city forced us into using Athens two weeks ago and they are by far the worst company I've ever had to deal with.They are incompetent and unable to pick up our trash.Our bins are overflowing and the buildings hallways are filled with horrible odor.Now,there have been mice spotted near the dumpsters and there's no relief in sight.
When I needed to call NASA,it was great,a human being would answer right away.With Athens,I have to wait on hold for a MINIMUM of 20 minutes each time.It seems unfair that we're not able to choose our service provider.If you have a choice,Athens is definitely not it!!

I just filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau regarding Athens and I suggest anyone who's having the same issues do the same.</review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2d6ef811970cd:0xdc9dbea06d8437be< /Gmap_id></record>

So far, I've made at least 6 phone calls to Athens for various things like:
- My Trash cans were taken because they set up my service at the wrong address.
- My Trash was left on the curb because they erroneously thought I had not paid my bill.

As for billing, after multiple calls:
- I still don't have my first bill.
- I have not received an invoice that I've asked for multiple times, even confirming my email over the phone.
- I HAVE received multiple calls regarding my bill, but have never been able to pay it.

Frankly, if you can avoid Athens, I highly recommend that. If you can't, then you feel my pain.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Worst customer service ever. We have been customers for 18 years.  We’ve had AutoPay and apparently our credit card expired in July.  No notification from Athens. Every other company with AutoPay notifies you so that you can update your info when your credit card expires. Not Athens, by policy...! So our credit card expired in July and Athens did not send any notices until October 15th when they sent us a final notice that they were going to collection! What kind of company chooses no communication for three months and then sends a collection notice?  18 year customer with perfect payment record. Shame on Athens.< /review>

Terrible service in whittier. I have called to schedule a bulky item pick up and they never came. Called and they said it was never scheduled.  Scheduled it again and they still never showed up. Items were left where they told me until 8pm then i had to drag the items back inside. Never had this problem with waste management or Ontario city trash service.</review>

All the bad reviews about this company are true! Customer Service is useless when it comes to missing pick up.  They missed the very 1st pick up of my new Condo project. Trash piled up for almost 1 week.  Kept calling customer service which promised "make up" pick up.  Never happen!  That's the problem of "having no competition".<//Text>

We are required to use them in the City of Pasadena for our construction work. They charge over 2x as any other company with by far the worst service. It takes 45 minutes to order a bin. You sit on hold for 15 minutes just to tell them why you called, then wait on hold for another 15 minutes to wait for the correct department to answer. They cant tell you when they can deliver it, making it impossible to efficiently plan a job. Franchised dump cities are the worst idea ever. Eliminates any competition so customer service and competitive pricing are non existent.  Only logical explanation is some city politician is getting kickbacks.<//Text>

We are also experiencing the mandatory trash service provider switch over that other reviewers are referring to. The city of LA never informed us of this change and we cannot get Athens to come and pick up our trash. It's been over two weeks now and it's disgusting. I'm reporting to the BBB and writing a letter to the city council.<//Text>

<Review>The worst experience in my life.  they  consistently miss pick ups then they don't credit the account.  I know that the city is changing the system and Republic is picking up our trash but they Athens never return my call after almost two weeks of calling them.
Update
So I was told by Republic which does the pick up but we get billed by Athens that they picked up.  That was a lie.
They did not pick up and we got billed.  So now I have to call Athens the day of or day after of missed pick up as well as Athens and yes I called the city.  If they procceed to say they picked up we have documented it.  We also have cameras with proof.  But Athens still has to communicate with us.
Update.
This is 12/10/17
They missed pick up on Friday it is now Monday the bins are over flowing documented with Republic, Athens and the city.  Let's see if they charge us for service that was never given.  They have till 6pm to pick up today.  Are service days are Tuesday and Fridays.  But Athens says Saturdays which never happens maybe once, In the last 5 months.
I probably call every week about missed service. The only reason is this week I was busy and didn't notice the bins till yesterday,  checked the surveillance cameras to see and sure enough no pick up. From my experience no accountablity from Athens Services.< /Review>< Pics>

If I could give zero stars I would! this company is simply the worst.  They have not picked up our trash in three weeks now! we have contacted them countless times over the past three weeks (sometimes three or four times in one day) and they promise to send someone over right away, but they NEVER follow through!  The piling up of garbage and the overflowing bin has created a health hazard in our building and we are now experiencing a terrible fly infestation as a result!  The people working at this company are extremely irresponsible.  I strongly advise against using this company.  We will be filing a complaint with the city shortly.< /text>

Athens Disposal has been our trash service for over 4 years now. I don't understand why. The drivers are incompetent. If there is a vehicle in front of the bin, do you think that they could knock on the door to see if we could move it. Or better yet, maybe wait until the vehicle is moved thirty seconds later! No, they would rather call their office and say that they can't do a pick up because a vehicle is blocking the bin. Some customer service! Even better are the supervisors who never call you back.
Goning to have to research service with other companies. I'm tired of Athens poor service.<//Text>

The truck drivers have been taking my fruits on the driveway as they emptying my trashes, I thought.... due to the rapid disappearing avocados on my tree.

I could not find an email to complain & submitted the photos of the peeled & half-eaten avocado on my driveway.

When I call & complain, I have to wait 35 minutes. When I ask about Athens' police & worker training concerning taking fruits on people's drive ways, Monique the operator gave me an attitude.<//Review>

Athens Services? They should cut the word "Services" from their name. It is actually Athens disservice...
Garbage is piling up in one of my buildings. My tenants are furious. They want to call the department of health services to declare the area a health hazard!!!
I don't blame them. Kids are running around near piles of garbage, Hundreds of flies are flying around and they surely carry diseases that can affect young children as well as adults.
Just a reminder...These services are not free and not cheap. Worst of all, there is NO option. The city of Los Angeles gave Athens a monopoly and they take an advantage of it...
Something MUST be done here. It's getting worse every day. We had to pay a private person to collect our garbage and pay additional fee!!!
This is a disgrace !!< /review>

I don't understand why we're not allowed to give negative stars. Ordered 3 yard dumpster which was limited at 600lbs for $120, first bin has no problem being picked up. Then problems started to occur with the 2nd bin, they kept on saying it's too heavy, they couldn't push it and get it on to the truck. Really? What's up with your 600lb weight limit if your guys can't push it? It was plasters and wood panels just like the first bin. They do not call you whatsoever when the bin is not picked up, no messages, no phone calls. We then started removing debris from the bin to make it "lighter". My husband is medium built Asian who's on the lean side, and he was able to push the bin no problem, nope, they came and didn't pick it up, said it was too heavy. Then we removed 1/3 of the bin, they came and said it was too heavy. They finally picked it up when there was only little bit more than 1/3 LEFT in the bin. Each time they come it's $50 to take a look at it, so to remove 1/3 of the bin, it costed us over $200. Their 600lb limit is completely BS, by their scale, if their guys can't push it, then it's over. Athens is the worst trash pick up service I've encountered, can't wait until their contract is up with the city of Monrovia.

My parents lives in Arcadia, use Waste Management for waste removal, and over the past nine months, they've been doing renovations with the house as well, and have removed 8 3-yard bins with them, never had any problems. WM guys are always nice, and willing to help, and they know exactly what they're doing.</text>

<Text>I"d give them a negative 10 if i could.  Every year, they miss pick up of trash for my 8 unit apartment house in Toluca Woods.  This year they missed 2 weeks in a row.  I called the office and was told the driver documented that the trash had been picked up.  The supervisor was a nice guy but, he is not the problem.

They have no "customer service" as we've come to know the term:  the people on the phone I use the term "ladies" loosely are not interested in any form of customer service.

Especially when I said I wanted to cancel my service effective end of March 2014. I explained to the customer service/sales: They have as I said above, missed service every year for many years.  The workers  don't put the dumpster back correctly, making it difficult to get around the dumpster.  They also scratch the gate that closes the dumpster from view.  I said I wanted to terminate service.

I was coldly told I had a contract that would not be available for renewal until 2017.  I'm 76 years old.  I could be dead and still be under contract with Athens!  Yikes.  No one would talk to me about cancelling my service.  I have to send a registered letter to  (I'm guessing)their corporate office at 14048 East Valley Blvd. La Puente, CA 91746 before someone will talk to me.  I typically don't swear.  but this is definitely worthy of a few choice words #@%!.  If you are having trouble with Athens Services/trash company it might be worth the effort to contact your county Supervisor and City council people.  These long term agreements are ridiculous They should be illegal.   There is no basis for them to be so long.  it's a loophole in the legal contract system.  And, it's being abused from what I can tell.</Text><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80c2d6ef811970cd:0xdc9dbea06d8437be< /gmap_id>< pics>

<review>We been having issues with Athens trash company picking up our trash!
They keep telling us there is cars parked in front of our trash bin and they don't bother to honk or knock on the business door. they just drive away.
Last Friday 03-02-18 they were suppose to empty the trash bin and they said there was a car parked in front of the bin so i called them and this is what they told me and they assured me it would be picked up later that day or Saturday morning.  NO ONE SHOWED UP! Then Monday came around and they said again there was a car parked in front of the bin and they left without any notice or warning. i dont believe that they even came. I spoke to 1st Angelica, 2nd Kenya and 3rd Mario a supervisor for the drivers for there routes. I called again today for the 4th time and spoke to Adrian and she assured me someone would be there by 6pm.
It is now 5:50pm and I called the office to find out they close at 5pm.
I never have had such a hard time as this with any trash services. I am disappointed in Athens that service the Covina area and tomorrow I will report them to the BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU!!! i HOPE YOU TAKE THE TIME TO READ MY POST!!!</review>< gmapID>

<text>Worst company around I made an appointment for them to pick up my Bulky Trash items in front of my house. I paid movers to move the stuff infront of my home. They gave me a reference number and a date and time to have all the stuff outside then they never showed. When I called him they had no clue what I was talking about and said i was going to have to wait another two weeks for a pickup what a joke.</text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Review>0 Stars, if i could rate it as such. Representatives Jeanine AND Amy both hung up on me when I asked to arrange for service at a residence.  It was close to the end of the work day and I have a suspicion that they hung up to pack up early and get out of work but I called DURING "hours of operation".  I am highly dissatisfied with customer service not to mention highly frustrated due to the postponement of pickup. You are losing customers, Athens Services.<//Review>< Pics>

I called because my trash can wasn't completely emptied. I thought it was my fault, but there was nothing stuck. Called Athens, they said they would come out the next day and pick it up. Never showed up. Waited until the next week; again it wasn't emptied. I thought how odd. Again, I waited until the next week. There was nothing causing the trash to get stuck. Watched as they emptied it again. Found out the claw was crushing the trash can, and the trash couldn't flow to be dumped....crazy. Third time was a charm. Just glad it wasn't summertime. It would have stunk after awhile.< /text>

Terrible customer service! Took over service 6/17 for Recologocy. Billed us with a 10% INCREASE on June 30th, decided they would send out a phantom letter on July 1 telling us of the increase. What TERRIBLE business practices.They also wanted a  30-day cancellation notice! I told them I did not have a service contract with them and would give them as much notice as they gave me for a 10% INCREASE. None. I would rather pay more for services with a company that has good business practices and recognize that their customers are key to their income.
Just found out that Republic will take over our account at the end of the year. Is this why they did the price increase? So they could inflate their selling price when they sell to Republic? I'm just saying.....<//Review>

<text>Worst experience with this company ever. My husband is a roofer so he frequents our local dump (which is owned by Athens) often. The last time he went to dump his roofing material one of the workers backed up and crushed the front end of our truck with a bulldozer. He was the manager and was very nice about the situation explaining to us the communication between him and the employee who sends people to certain areas was not clear. He apologized and gave us the info to contact Athens insurance department. First off the man who handled are claim (Jose Aguilar) was extremely rude and made our experience long, exhausting and uncomfortable. He was not only rude and unhelpful with us but with the auto body shop as well. Long story short, we are still dealing with the situation months later, it was their fault we were in the situation in the first place and a good company would have made our experience easy and stress free. Worst experience ever, I will never recommend this company.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<Review>This is the worst customer service. They failed to pick up our residential building's trash as they are "transitioning" from Waste Management to Athens. They lie and don't follow up. This is the fourth time we have requested they pick up the trash. It smells. It's toxic. We miss Waste Management. This company should be reported to the city of LA.< /Review>< user_id>

This company is absolutely terrible.  I found the keys to basically every building in a 2 mile radius in our garage door key switch one day and had to chase down the truck to give them back to the operator.  They routinely miss pick ups or leave the dumpsters on the street without putting them back.  Today I called to tell them they had missed the recycle pick up and was treated to an extremely sarcastic and unhelpful customer service agent who told me that they did not have the key.  Apparently the recycle guys are different than the trash guys, but Athens can't be bothered to tell us that or let us know that their people can't get in, they just skip the pickup while still charging and then supply a big load of grief when you call them to rectify the situation.  Avoid this awful company.

Update after 10 months; 10/09/18:  significantly less problems with this company after they basically monopolized the LA trash scene which seems counterintuitive.  No problems with the service any time in recent memory and relatively friendly customer service reps these days.</Text>

They say they'll pick up trash but ALWAYS miss pick up days AND demand to get paid. City of L.A needs to stop this Monopoly immediately. I have a 31 unit apartment and our bins are ALWAYS overflowing with trash -recycle included, despite we requested services 3x's a week!!! Athen workers will close out work orders stating they pick up trash but evidence suggests otherwise.</review>

Avoid these guys at all cost! My vehicle was damaged due to them hauling an uncovered load and they flat out refused to do anything about it. They said that the Athens service truck and two trailers labeled Athens services were not associated with them therefore they will not take responsibility</Text>

The garbage men are not to be trusted. My garage has had stuff stolen from it on multiple occasions at least 3 times in about 2 years and every time it's the day after the garbage was collected and we've found the back gate was left unlocked. Coincidence? I doubt it. And when I called company to complain they've done nothing. What a disgrace of a business. They are losing us as a client this month.. I doubt they will even care.</text>

Quality freshness and taste you can always count on at Panera! I love their French onion soup with homemade croutons with half albacore tuna sandwich meal deal. We share a Margherita flat bread pizza that we can never finish but is absolutely amazing and worth taking home for snacking. They also have a great rewards program, we got a free bagel last time, and excellent pastries as well as teas and coffee. Panera is great wholesome food on the go that we can always count on!< /Text>

Such amazing flavor, I had a hard time putting my sandwich down! I had the tuna salad sandwich with arugula and spicy mustard added. Wow! It was delicious, soft bread but didnt fall apart, excellent proportions, and tasted very fresh. The soul also had a fresh flavor with well cooked vegetables.  The service was speedy, professional, and friendly. Will definitely be coming back! Highly recommend  😍</Text>

We like a lot to go out. Yesterday we  visited this delicious place which friends recommended to us. We spent a delightful evening there with fine food and a courteous team and a great chief cook. We  added this restaurant in our list  and we shall no doubt return soon. We highly recommend.</review>

<Review>I'll keep this simple and to the point. If you want your money's worth this is the location to go to!!!! Dale Road and McHenry Boulevard locations... forget them!!! Remember that you're paying 12 dollars for a sandwich or salad at times. You deserve to get a 12 dollar sandwich or salad. You won't get it at Dale rd. or McHenry. Just one visit to this Riverbank location and you'll know what I'm talking about. Good health and good fortune to all who read this!!!< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<review>This place is so inconsistent, we order food to go and the condiments and silverware are always a hit and MISS. How hard is it to consistently put the same stuff in a bag every time? Very disappointed with this place.</review>< userid>

<username>Angie Gorkoff</username><review>Always good quality food served quickly by friendly staff. Healthy menu options are the norm. Be prepared to drop some $$$ - my small half sandwich, small salad and drink came to $14. The staff mentioned it was a "deal". Folks come here for the healthy options, not the savings. Can't afford to come here regularly but once in awhile is a treat. Highly recommend.< /review><rating>5< /rating><Gmap_id>0x8090570e583cfc87:0x4bda924089883ea6</Gmap_id>< pictures>

It was my 3rd time at Riverbank location and my last.  Even though this location is close, I prefer the McHenry Panera best.< /text>< Pics>

Smoothie was good but not worth the 20 min wait in the drive thru... Only one customer in front of me in the drive thru that had placed a big order, not a big deal, but if you know its gonna be awhile wouldn't common sense tell you to have them pull around front instead of holding up the line for 20 min...< /Text>

<Date>1571354173789<//Date><review>This panera never has the rapid order pickups ready to go at the time designated, and if they do, they do not utilize the pickup station. There is no seating near the pick up shelves, so you have to stand there awkwardly as customers pick up their own orders and carry them to the tables themselves. Never been to a panera like this, I'd recommend going to a Panera in Modesto instead if you can.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures></record>

I was even confuse that when your food is ready your timer vibrates and they expect you to pick up your food at the window... this is something we are not used to since every Panera we gone to they normally bring the food to us and they are normally super friendly. And last the food portion was ridiculous. Everyone knows Panera is expensive and when you go to places like Panera and pay what you pay you expect a good portion but not at this place.. is sad to see such a bad experience for such of new place.< /text>< pictures>

Worst Panera I've ever been to.  Who is running this place?  I've been there over 50 times now, and I would say I have waited on average over 45 mins in the drive thru and they have got my order wrong 95% of the time!!

The manager needs to be FIRED!  So poorly run, I can't believe the owner wouldn't be monitoring his/her facility better.  I travel around the country visiting different stores and honestly, I have never seen one like this.

You want to wait 45 mins in the drive thru and get your order wrong almost every time..then go here.  You notice that when you drive by now, no one is in the drive thru?  Because a lot of homeowners in Riverbank have learned their lesson!!</text>

< review>
My grandson and I walked into the Panera Bread in Riverbank CA and cash register clerk Jose just finished helping the person in front of me at around 5:45pm and then on to say, excuse me, but I’ll be right with you, when he proceeded to get Bagels from bagel area, take them to the back and was gone for 5 minutes, no one out front except girl filling up ice machine, as we sit and wait to place our order. They keep doing this to customers and they’re not going to have them come back. Horrible customer service at the Riverbank Panera, and it looked like a manager was in back, way to run your store. The manager on duty is not doing her job< /review>

<Time>1617064077828<//Time><Rate>5<//Rate><Review>I found this place while preparing for the birth of my baby. I wanted to start getting adjustments to make sure labor goes easier. I have already had two adjustments and one prenatal massage. Dr. Olson, who does the alignments is very nice and reassuring. I can totally trust her. She is a pro, and she's been in this for over 26 years I heard! And the massage... I get massages a lot, but this was the best massage I have ever had! I highly recommend this place. And they are very affordable.< /Review>< pictures>

I’ve been going to Olson Chiropractic since she opened her business. I first met Heidi in 1996 at a fair in Antioch and was impressed with her then. For 25 years Heidi has put me back together. She has seen me through painful and some scary times when I did not think I would get better. However, her smile and positivity always kept me going and showing up for my appointments. I am finally a “good” patient showing up for my regular appointments so she can keep me aligned and subluxation free!

There is a reason that she has a near 5.0 rating. Having known her for as long as I have, I can tell she has great integrity and I openly question anyone who complains about that. This is a woman who cares about your health. I could not recommend her higher!</Text>

<text>Doctor Olson has helped me heal from painful injuries that have seriously affected my daily life.. a slipped rib in 2015, my lower back injury in 2017, and now in May 2021, a huge knot in my chest rib area that was hurting not only when I moved around in certain positions but while I was taking deep breaths as well.

Can’t thank Dr Olson and her team enough 🙏🏽.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><rating>5< /rating>< GmapID>

In 2009 I moved away and continued to seek chiropractic care with a handful of other Dr’s. Many were average, with only 1 being good. But no one has ever compared to Dr. Olson. Fast forward to 2020 with me moving back to the east bay. Last weekend I completely pulled my back out and immediately went in to see Dr. Olson that following Monday morning. It’s only been 1 week and I’m starting to feel so much better again! Dr. Olson is hands down the best there is and I’m so glad to be in her care again!</Review>< Pictures>

The most warm and friendly service and care, the chiropractors all really take care of you and work with your needs to help you on your path to recovery.

Since I have been going, for about 6 months now, I have noticed less pain and more energy in my day to day life.

Pain can be a very draining experience, do yourself a service and come down to be taken care of< /Review>

I have known Dr. Olson since childhood. We attended the same elementary, Jr. High school and High school in Northern California. Dr. Olson was determined to become a chiropractor from the age of 12. Her genuine desire to help people live happier healthy lives is the foundation of her career and dedication to her patients. I have witnessed the hard work and sacrifices Dr. Olson has made through the years to become a master of her profession. Her knowledge and expertise about how the nervous system and body work is a profound illustration of her dedication to provide the latest most advanced techniques in her field. She also employs and educates her staff to the highest level of treatment, care and dedication to each patient that has made her a leader in chiropractic and wellness! I highly recommend her to anyone who is looking to increase their quality of life!< /Text>

Dr. Olson’s office is organized chaos. When you arrive do not expect to be seen on time for most of your visits. Heidi would frequently skip me, which caused me to to be seen 30 - 40 minutes after my visit. Her adjustments were fine, but after a while she started passing me off to her intern every single visit. This intern was fresh out of school. It would have been good to see some balance between the two. I think Heidi was just trying to get rid of me.

Do you ever wonder how she has a perfect 5.0 on Google? It is not because this office is perfect. Far from it. Instead they offer you a free Starbucks gift card if you make a review. And on that card they show a five star ranking, implying that this is what you should give. I’m standing up to this because reviews should be based on truth and real experiences. Not just writing some generic text so you can get a free coffee.

The final reason I will never go back here is shady billing practices. On my last credit card bill I noticed that they were double billing me for my Friday appointments. After noticing this I called in and asked why they would bill me twice for one appointment and they informed me that they had missed billing me for appointments and were making up for missed billings they had made. You can imagine how angry this made me that they were billing me later for appointments they had supposedly missed. I asked for those specific appointments they had missed and were making up for but they never were able to answer. I think this was just another one of Heidi’s shady business practices to get money from me on my way out.

Do you want to get Chiropractic services at a place like this? I say why would you when there are so many other options in the area. Think twice when you see a perfect 5.0 star review like these on Google. There has to be a deeper story. Thank you for reading about my experience and I hope it helps you!</Review>

<Review>I was referred to Olson Chiropractic, and when I called for my initial consultation I was able to get an appointment immediately that day. The office is a well oiled machine of staff who took good care of me. Clearly, Dr Olson and the other chiropractors are very experienced, especially with pregnant women like me! She found all the reasons I’m having pain in my hips and headaches, so I’m feeling confident they were able to help me. And the icing on the cake was their massage therapists in house that I was able to book.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x808561251c8a34ef:0xe3b089e0cf27f644<//Gmap_id></record>

I started going to Dr Olson in March 2020 and I'm very impressed with the results and the way the office is run. I never wait more then 5 minutes to go into an exam room and Dr Olson always seems to find the spot that's bothering me most. Her office staff is amazing as they work together seamlessly. I highly recommend this practice.</text>

I was recommended to Dr. Olson by my best friend after I was involved in a car accident. From the very first visit, the staff has been so friendly and welcoming. They explain what my treatment process would be like. Dr. Olson And Dr. Gena have been great throughout my visits.</Text>

Olson chiropractic always offers kind quick service. They are very organized, personable and know everyone by name. Dr. Olson thrives on making everyone feel like they are the only patient in the office at that time. 💜

Dr. Olson is one of a kind and truly amazing. She genuinely cares about your health and well being. She always knows exactly what I need to make me feel better. She takes such good care of me and my two sons. Whenever anyone says they're having any type of issue, I refer them to her because without a doubt I know she can and will help them feel better too. I love Dr. Olson so much. She is a gift in my life for sure.</text>

I started going to Olson Chiropractic after getting into a car accident and it has been amazing! The staff is really friendly and knowledgeable. Dr. Olson takes the time to get to know each of her patients individually and is completely holistic which is what sets her apart from other chiropractors. I always look forward to my time spent at Olson Chiropractic!<//Text>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>I just started with Olson Chiropractic and couldn’t be happier with my decision. Very consultative from the start and truly care about their patients, creating a personalized plan instead of a general approach (which I’ve experienced with other chiropractors). After 1 week, I’ve already regained range of motion in my neck and shoulders, and am sleeping better. Can’t recommend Olson Chiropractic enough!</review>< gmap_id>

This is by far the most professional, friendly and clean chiropractic office I have ever been to. Making an appointment after hurting my neck was easy, all of the staff is extremely knowledgeable, friendly and empathetic. I look forward to continuing my care with Dr. Olson to both correct my current pain as well as long term spinal care.<//review>

I've been getting treatment here for almost 6 months I think, and honestly, I'm so glad my kids forced me to go. I couldn't move my neck for months, and my back was so messed up to where I couldn't do the simplest task (just touching my back was very painful). The staff was very friendly and always had a smile on their faces from the very beginning and till now they haven't changed. I Still get greeted with a smile and very friendly attitude. Now Doctor Olson, she IS AMAZING!!! My second visit I was able to move my neck again. I am so grateful.<//Review>

Being there is like going to school, if it is important to you to strengthen a very important part of your overall health .
Dr. Olson is the captain of a very tight ship, although my nickname for her is WWF. I can’t say enough about how pleasant and professional the staff is. When you come in they speak with a smile, all of them. Of course I am quite biased because of the change in my  health due to their work. My health is much better than when I first came in and it is gradually getting better.
Each one of the crew has their own special talent. The young man who does the massages, I can’t say enough about him, you have to experience him for yourself. I call him Allstate,  because when he is at work you are definitely in good hands.
Then there is Patti who I call peanut, because she is so cerebral. WWF’s new assistant is very precise, pays attention to detail, and is knowledgeable, and her main attribute is she is sweeter than Christmas candy.
That’s just a few, like I said WWF runs a tight ship always working together and having your health as first priority. I don’t remember everyone’s name, this is probably the most consistent care both physically because of their knowledge and professionalism and mentally because of their pleasantness.

Thank you!

It is my husband experienced. He said all the staff are very appreciative. Doctor Olson has a very very good knowledge by pointing and doing her magical relieving pressure techniques. Most of the time he also went there early or late on his appointment and it’s not a big deal for them if the doctor is available he goes right away.  To Olson Chiropractic. Thank you so much he is truly in a very good condition now after the car accident. More power and God  bless.<//review>

Clean & professional. Dr. Olson is knowledgeable, engaging & an effective strong Chiropractor. She helped my body recover from the injury I had when I sought her care about a year ago and continues to bring me relief as I continue to return for preventative pain & immunity care. A real gem on Monument Blvd! #grateful</text>

I’ve been a patient here for 6 years or more! I love it!! Dr Heidi Olson helped me from daily migraines and arm pain. She can read my body before I tell her what’s wrong. She is also very holistic. I appreciate that adding nutrition herbs and supplements to chiro and self care. Her staff is always accommodating and gracious. Thank you all for the experience weekly!<//Text>

Dr Olson is great!!! She has repair my back & neck after a car accident,  and mended my knee after a ski accident (KP orthopedic doctor wanted to do surgery.) Her positive attitude and gentle care is very much appreciated and professional. Her staff is friendly and helpful. I always feel better after an adjustment and visit to Dr Olson's office.</Review>

<Text>I came to Olson Chiropractic when my mother and I got into a car accident. We were desperately looking for a chiropractor that we can depend on. The first time we step foot in Olson Chiropractic we felt right at home. The staffing are amazing and beautiful ladies that are full of joy and very professional. The ladies are also bilingual. Olson Chiropractic has a very diverse clientele and they treat all of us the same. The staffing practices cultural humility and compassion.
Dr. Olson has been great to me and my mother. She is very welcoming and just has positive energy. Dr. Olson has helped me through my healing process. I use to suffer from migraines, shoulder pain, foot pain and she has helped me reduce the pain. I have been seeing Dr. Olson since October and I’m very satisfied with the service.< /Text>< Response>

If youre looking for the best, look no further! Dr. Olson and her staff cant be topped. Ive been a patient for awhile (general maintenance now) and I continue to be amazed by their friendliness and customer service at the desk and Dr. Olson is pure magic. Her bedside manner and ability to listen and treat accordingly is very comforting. Her office is very busy, but runs like a well oiled machine. I am truly grateful I found her.<//Text>

I love Olson chiropractic, I’ve been coming here for a while now for my back pain. I suffered from neck pain and headaches as well and now that I have a plan and schedule with my adjustments, I’ve noticed a huge improvement with my pain. The girls at the front are all so helpful and nice. The Doctors are great and really care about their patients. I’m so happy I found Olson chiropractic!!</review>

Dr. Olson is the most wonderful, awesome person. And she is also a GREAT CHIROPRACTOR.
She really truly cares about each and everyone.
I was always afraid to go to a chiropractor  until I met her.
I have learned so much about how important it is to keep my body aligned.<//review>

What an awesome place. Dr Heidi O is so knowledgeable and strong. I came to Dr Heidi in such horrible, excruciating, incessant pain. I tried three masseuses and one other chiro and no one could fix my back/neck injury. Dr Heidi had me take x rays before she did any adjusting. I am soooo glad we did; I fully trust Dr Heidi O. She is the real deal; she’s very gifted and is a natural healer.

Also, Dr Irene is amazing with wrist and elbow stuff. Dr Irene helped me heal my horrible tennis elbow which was a result of my back injury.</text>

This is the first adjustment and the first time for me, it felt fantabulous afterwards for 3 days, no symptom!

Thanks to Dr. Olson!

HAVE been seeing Dr. Heidi Olson for 12 years. Her staff and she has been great.
She was able to loosen up tightness that I didn't even feel before she worked on me! I'm always amazed by the Grace of God how healing her treatments have been for me. #thankful<//Review>

Dr. Olson thinks, speaks, and treats physiology. She listens and abserves to give the patient an unusual combination of competency and care. I don’t know how she can keep the level of empathy she has all day with all of her patients, but she does. And her staff is kind and thorough. They remember us all by name and are patient when last minute rescheduling is required. I recommend hDr. Olson and her staff  to everyone.<//Review>

<Review>Before coming to Dr. Olson (about four years ago) by the end of every day my back was burning with pain, I couldn't stand in line, I was half an inch shorter by the end of the day, my neck was stiff, and I didn't get much sleep.  At night, both my arms would be numb/pins and needles.  I thought everyone had slanted hips and shoulders, and a rib hanging low.  I took advantage of a free x-ray.  At first when I saw it, I thought it was a trick.  When I realized that it was, indeed, my spine, I almost cried.  I'm an active, but older woman.  Dr. Olson explained that it was scoliosis and probably developed when I was about eleven.  I had lived with pain for years and didn't know that anything could be done about it.   Dr. Olson "fixed" me.  She has an intuitive and holistic approach.  Following Dr. Olson's instructions for stretching, exercising, and regular adjustments, the pain went away.  In addition, twice, I tore ankle tendons.  Dr. Olson told me how to recover and I have full motion and no stiffness.  I feel great and I want to keep it that way.  Dr. Olson is amazing.  I am very grateful.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None</response><gmapID>0x808561251c8a34ef:0xe3b089e0cf27f644< /gmapID></record>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>Heidi Olson is the best chiropractor! I came in on a whim long ago with my mom. Heidi noticed I had no curvature in my neck. She took a quick x-ray and gave me an adjustment. I think it was about $40 but it was also about 10 years ago. Heidi said she could fix it and gave me a schedule to come in for regular visits. A few months in, she took another X-ray which showed proof that the adjustments were working. I now could see - and feel - the curvature in my neck. I also felt more confident with how I looked since my head wasn’t sticking out forward. During the months of treatment, it was a little painful for a while but then started feeling great, and this was what Heidi said would happen.

Most recently, I went to Heidi because I had a pain in my ribs that went from subtle to excruciating in a matter of days. It hurt to move, it hurt to breath. As Heidi said hello and touched my spine, she said, “Oh, this rib popped out of place. Let me fix that.” It was sooo satisfying!!

This has been my experience with Heidi over the last ten-ish years. I’ve come in with pain in a certain spot and without me having to tell her, she points it out and corrects it. I often have come in a couple times for the each pain/injury but have always felt great afterward. Some things I remember coming in for are hip out of place, and a bunch of kinks and tightness in my back and neck. I also came in late in my pregnancy with hip and back pain - wish I would’ve gone in sooner. Heidi tells me where my spine is mis-aligned before I say anything about where I’m having pain. It’s truly amazing. Her adjustments give me more mobility and reduce pain.< /Text>< pics>

<text>I love Olson chiropractic!!! This office is so awesome the staff is so friendly and welcoming. I first came to see Dr. Olson because of my Neck and low back pain. The pain was so uncomfortable that I had to take meds, after seeing her for several adjustments I finally saw relief. I stopped taking medication and the pain went from an 8 to almost a complete 0.  I still get the occasional ache but nothing compared to before. Thank you Dr. Olson and staff you guys are great! I recommended my family here and they too have seen great results.< /text><UserId.>100091406590813079897< /UserId.>< resp>

Staff:
Kind, knowledgeable, AMAZING!
They're always so cheery and welcoming.

Dr Olson:
Incredibly helpful, compassionate, FANTASTIC
She takes the time to discuss things that work or don't specific to my needs. In my experience; her goal was never to get me in and out, it was always to come up with a long term solution.

I can not recommend this place more!< /Review>

I had been to Olson Chiropractic because she had helped me  before. This time, I had terrible back pain and spasms, I was even having trouble moving at work. Dr. Olson worked hard to get my back in shape and out of the cycle of pain, since then, she has kept my back in line. I seldom have back pain now, and since I see her regularly, she always puts it in shape. Without her I would be in pain constantly.<//review>

Dr. Olson and team take customer service to another level.  They always find a way for me to be seen and take time to focus on education and wellness, and not just adjusting. You can really tell she is committed to her patients' health and wellness.< /text>

<user>103927889444502169441< /user><review>When I first went in, it was a couple years ago on July 3rd. They were the only ones open and I was hurting really bad. They had me fill out a packet detailing everything about my pain and any accidents/things that happened in the past that could have lead to chronic pain now. They had me take an x-ray, which they do in the building too, then they had me lay down for a half hour while they iced my back to help with the swelling. I was having trouble sleeping, breathing, and just functioning. Doctor Olson set up a plan with me and got me feeling like a person again. When my wife needed a new chiropractor when she moved in with me, I had her go here. She lives Doctor Olson as much as I did and it's helped her a ton too.< /review>< date>

I originally went to see Dr. Olson after a bad car accident.  She was referred to me by one of my work colleagues.  I had never been to a chiropractor before but I was in so much pain from the accident and I was just given medications for the pain from the hospital which made it hard for me to focus.  I decided to give her a try.  She made me feel comfortable with the treatment and surprisingly, I was feeling better soon after my first visit.  Since that first accident, I have seen her on an intermittent basis for ailments or injuries.  She has always gotten me back on my feet.  It’s always nice to know that I can get myself back into shape with her help.  It’s been over 15 years since that car accident that I have seen Dr. Olson for but know I can count on her and chiropractic to help put me back together.  I am thankful for my colleagues recommendation and I would recommend her to anyone suffering from neck or back pain.< /text>

I was referred to Olson Chiropractic because I was training for 2 endurance events - Ironman Cozumel 70.3 and also the New York City Marathon.  I had injured my back in the middle of my training cycle.  I went to Dr. Olson who immediately diagnosed the problem and began therapy. Within days of her working with me, my pain subsided and I was able to continue my training.  I recently returned from my race in Mexico and had a phenomenal race.  Without Dr. Olson's help I probably would not have been able to compete.  Additionally, I have to say that her staff is excellent, professional, welcoming and it is a pleasure to visit the office and be looked after with such caring individuals.   Thank you Dr. Olson and staff!!!!!<//text>

<Review>Dr. Heidi is amazing. I've been going to DCs for some 30 years (i'm about 50) and know who has the 'magic touch' and who is just faking the movement. Dr. Heidi has the ability to almost instantly feel your misalignments and joint problems. Sure, she still uses X-rays and your input for additional backup, but I would say her 'gift' is the main reason I will continue to visit her and refer all my friends and family.
She has been a lifesaver for my entire family. For example: my wife had constant pain in her hands and arms, which was diagnosed (by Kaiser) as carpel tunnel syndrome. She followed the recommended treatments and changes to her work environment (mostly on a keyboard), but was having little success. She was about to give up and go 'under the knife' for surgical relief, which I am totally against. I talked her into giving Dr. Heidi a try at least before she did anything drastic. It was like a miracle. After the first treatment she felt relief, which continued to improve after repeated visits. The numbness and weakness in her hands and arms has gone, and she no longer wakes up with numb hands.
But YOU, the patient, must also take control of their health and outcome. Dr. Heidi can help you start healing, but without proper care, our bodies will deteriorate faster than we desire. An active lifestyle with solid nutrition are the key to a long, healthy life. The patient must engage and be active in their desire to improve, otherwise I'm sure Kaiser will prescribe some opiates for you.< /Review>< userid>

(Translated by Google) Every objective requires its process, this is how it works and I am starting my therapies for a period of several months, until now I am satisfied with the service and I trust GOD and of course the chiropractic and staff that everything will be fine. I give it 5 stars.

<Review>(Translated by Google) Hello, I want to highlight the incredible care that Dr. Olson had with me some years ago. I fully recovered from knee, ankle, shoulder, neck, back and waist pain. I thank you infinitely for all your help that you gave me at that time. She earned my full trust, and now that my son had some health problems, do not hesitate to go to her, and now she treats him, with very satisfactory results, I thank her again. And to all those people who have health problems, I recommend visiting Dr. Olson chiropractic, who I am sure she can help you. With his knowledge and experience, he makes one as a patient regain the hope of not living with pain.
THANK YOU DR HEIDI OLSON

(Original)
Hola, quiero destacar la increible atencion que la Dra. Olson tuvo conmigo hace ya algunos años. Me recupere totalmente del dolor de rodilla, de tobillo, de hombro, de cuello, de espalda y de cintura. Le agradezco infinitamente por toda su ayuda que me brindo en ese momento. Se gano mi plena confianza, y ahora que mi hijo tuvo algunos problemas de salud, no dude en acudir a ella, y ahora lo atiende , con resultados muy satisfactorios, nuevamente le doy las gracias. Y a todas aquellas personas que les aquejen problemas de salud, les recomiendo visitar a la Dra.Olson chiropractic,  que estoy seguro ella los podra ayudar. Con su conocimiento y su experiencia hace que uno como paciente recupere la esperanza de no vivir con dolor.
GRACIAS DRA.HEIDI OLSON< /Review>< username>

Beware for those on VSP coverage.

However excellent place to get your examination, this facility does not house optometrist for your eye glasses.

What this means is that whomever on VSP coverage won't be able to get their glasses made here (although you will be met with wonderful staffs)  Further complicate the issue, most optometrist won't see you unless you get your examination done at the same time.  Meaning by mistake, if you get your examination here, you will suffer the grave consequences.

Your only option at this point is to travel to their nearest frenchise to location which "occasionally" has in house optometrist which is in Rowland heights.

And by god. All these was not explained at the front nor when I was making the appointment.
On VSP website list this facility as "premier" meaning it's all in one stop shopping. Which is not.

By not disclosing such a small detail made me waste time and money. Plus headaches.</review>

<Review>I travel with my job and came into California to visit my son and family.  I was having flashes of light occur in my eye two weeks prior and called when I arrived to schedule an appointment and I was scheduled within a few days.  The staff were friendly and helpful and Dr Davis was exceptional and informational.  Loved this office and when I return to California this will be my Drs office of choice for the care of my eyes.<//Review><user_id>107722783308979605640</user_id><Resp>None</Resp><Pics>None</Pics>< date>

My first visit today 2/6/2020 I had a very positive experience, when I first walked in I wrote my name down and sit down to wait: the atmosphere felt good people having conversations cos even though lt is a eye specialist and you go there not knowing what the outcome or eye problem will be; people look content and or positive being there: that alone gave me a good feeling: when I was called to front window the staff was very nice very courteous and friendly so were the back staff nurses: Dr was very nice and communicative Not to mention very handsome too: I left the office feeling glad I had chosen this clinic to take care of my eye: and no wonder patients there all seemed to be in a familiar atmosphere: well is because all the staff and Dr. are very patient friendly! I give it an A for excellence and A+ for service!!</Text>

I have been going to the Retina Institute of California in Pomona for the last three years. I am impressed with the efficiency and friendliness of the office staff, which to me is important as I am seeing them on a monthly basis. But most importantly is the treatment I am receiving. I see Dr Davis, who is highly skilled at what he does, and does a wonderful job of making a patient feel comfortable and at ease. I have been able to maintain my vision under his care. I realize I can get treatment closer to my home, however, I have put my trust in Dr Davis and feel it is worth the hour plus drive.<//review>

<rating>5< /rating><text>The Retina Institute is a very clean and professional business with very competent and skilled employees. I always feel that I am being well taken care of and that the health of my eyes is of major importance to the staff. Every employee takes the time to make you feel at ease and never rushes when questions are asked or something needs to be explained.  I always feel as if I am very important to each and every staff member that I am involved with.   From Dr. Davis all the way down to the housekeeping staff I feel each is well qualified in their position and that I am in good hands. I feel it is a privilege to be able to have my eyes cared for by such a great team of medical professionals.<//text>< Pics>

<Review>Caring and dedicated people. Well-equipped. They arranged my mom a same day visit, a follow-up in 2 days, promptly scheduled my mom for the soonest surgery and did their best to help her to have pre-operation tests done soon. Instruction is very detailed. We can't expect any better.</Review>< Pics>

The only thing that Didn’t like is the waiting time to sign in at arrival because there is not a sign in sheet and the gentleman behind the counter takes his sweet time to ask you your name and check the status of your paperwork meantime answering the phone calls. Put back the sign in sheet or the lady that knows all the patients by name at the register. Thank you all.< /Text>

<date>1444847757060<//date><rate>5</rate><Review>I'm a patient of Dr. Michael Davis, a superior retina specialist with Retina Institute of California. I had been foolish  not paying attention to the warning signs of a detaching retina, when I finally saw Dr. Davis my retina had completely detached, I was blind in one eye and very frightened.  I have a family history of retina detachment with failed surgical outcome, I was shocked and hopeless when I heard my diagnosis however that was the beginning of an extraordinary journey. Dr. Davis quickly scheduled surgery, he was calm, reassuring and explained in detail current status and his surgical plan to reattach, using cutting-edge technology coupled with his excellent skill set.    I am three years post-op and have 20/20 corrected vision.  I am grateful everyday that I was referred  to The Retina Institute and especially Dr. Michael Davis. Finally, I believe the  Institute has many excellent retina specialists, and their staff is unusually efficient, courteous and knowledgeable they are wonderful with patients and their doctors. As a retina patient I would encourage everyone to make an appointment if you are experiencing any vision irregularities. The Retina Institute of California is the best.<//Review>< Pics>

I have been going to Dr. Tom Chang at the Retina Institute for a year.  Before my opthalmologist would do cataract surgery, he had me check at the Institute.  They are doing regular followup.  The office staff is very kind and professional and the docs are top notch and specialists in the retina.  They have special equipment that allows them to see the health of your retina.  My wait at any given time has been minimal.  I would hardily refer the Retina Institute of California.</review>

Do not trust their administrative practices. After I went through the process of getting ready for surgery and after driving for oves 1 1/2 hour to the surgery center, I found out that Crystal, their scheduler had failed to schedule my appointment. My wife and I are both self-employed and had closed our offices so I could have a ride for the surgery. I tried to talk to both Dr. Davis and Crystal and both of them refused to take my call. This is the most unprofessional staff I have ever dealt with.</Review>

Local spot with some interesting prints and comfortable cloths. Would be 5 stars if they would stay better stocked. Often times I leave empty handed because they only have small and double XL of the things im interested in.</Review>

His role at the company was inventory and he should not have been the one to address the situation. We are sorry that you had a bad experience and would have an open ear to any future advise. A company will at times hire employees that do good work and at times bad, we will always face a problem and correct for the customers best future experiences. When or if you come back to the store be sure to ask for the owner Jason and he would be happy to give you a discount on your next order. Hope all is well with you.'}</Resp><gmap_id>0x54d1556482bd8b1f:0xac47243ed66c1de3<//gmap_id>< Review>
This day November 18th I was greeted as equal. Upon leaving the store, after my 70$ purchase I realize I was over charged! When I called to talk to the man on the receipt (BILLy)  I was not only greeted with hostility, and diversion but also with a chore to Remidy the situation.... I work hard for my dollars....and regardless of how PETTY the difference seems to you it is my money.... And I ought to be charges accurately and not made to feel miniscule.... I will never shop at HumboldtRepublic I will return all my items....and go the Humboldt the original....lost equal.<//Review>

Smells like fumes, static noise for music, on top of that dude was rude to someone for walking into the wrong door.</Text>
< response>
{'time': 1602180889645, 'text': 'Just noticed this review. Sorry to hear about your bad experience.  Our store is a print shop. We design and print everything on site in that location. We used to have a fume smell every now and then when we cleaned screens, typically it is only a hour process but we have received a few complaints so we moved the process to the side building to help with the smell. The employee that was rude was probably concerned that somebody was going into the printing shop section during this cleaning process, granted he had no right to be rude at all and this was not the appropriate response. He is actually the only employee that we have received complaints on ever in this google review section, his employment has been terminated and we have corrected these concerns for our customers. Hope all is well.'}</response>

Great customer service and a good selection of TVs, bedroom sets and large appliances. I would have given 5 stars, but not so much variety of upholstered living room furniture, everything is brown or black. Lots of coffee and end tables though. Dearden's is permanently closing all of their stores in a couple of weeks, so lots of bargains to be had right now. I got a great deal on an HP notebook and Dell computer, small appliances (blender, etc.), and a really pretty jewelry armoire.< /Text>

Bad service I bought a living set and it was not delivered the day it was suppose arrive. Called the store and was told the sales person did not confirmed the delivery. I spoke with a manager and she said that she couldn't do anything except set up another delivery for two days later. They are inconsiderate and not helpful...<//Text>

(Translated by Google) To be clear, now that you are going bankrupt, better not even buy, from experience I say,
I took out a horn, it was ruined, it cost me 480, and also a 5-year guarantee, now I have it, and they have me with buts, they can't fix it, and what come, another day. Now they told me to come on Monday, because the manager will be here ☹️😣☹️

(Original)
Para ser claro, ahora que se va a la banca rota, mejor ni compren, por experiencia lo digo,
Saque una bocina, se arruino, me costó 480, y también garantía por 5 años, ahora ya la lleve, y me tienen con peros, que no la pueden arreglar, y qué venga, otro día. Ahora me dijeron que venga el lunes, por que acá va a estar el manager ☹️😣☹️</Review>

Excellent customer service, honest and reliable!
As a female, it can be difficult to find a trustworthy mechanic. I had many negative experiences but now, I feel confident taking my car for service at Meineke Car Care in Northridge.  The waiting room is super clean and they have  delicious coffee!<//review>

< Review>
I’ve always had excellent service at this location by Harry and his staff. From oil changes to brake jobs the work has been top notch and done at a very reasonable cost.  The staff are always friendly, pleasant and professional, and I’ve had no issues at all with the explanation of work to be done and the speed in which it’s completed.  I have recommend this Meineke branch to friends and family members as well.  Keep up the good work!!< /Review>

They took the time to show and explain to me the issues my car was having as well as how they planned to fix it. They provided phone call updates and did their best to provide me with deals/discounts to reduce my overall cost of repairs. I will continue to have my vehicle serviced at this location and I recommend you do too!< /review>< user>

<review>I needed my brakes done.. I'm not the most savvy with cars.. but I walked in and was immediately greeted by Harry, he's super nice, very informative, and helping everyone in a thorough and prompt manner. He checked out my car, figured out the problem, and was able to replace everything the same day! He even made sure that I knew about the current coupons, and included in the price. He was good with explaining the products, and warranties to me. It was my first time at Meineke but it certainly won't be my last!<//review><UserId.>103302835629050718905</UserId.>< time>

< Review>
LOVE HARRY AND EVERYONE WORKING AT MEINEKE. Harry was the first face to greet me at the front desk. From the very beginning I could see he was knowledgeable and knew what he was talking about. I came in for a broken drivers side mirror, which they fixed in like 20 minutes! They’re all hardworking and very understanding. I absolutely recommend going to Meineke for any of your car troubles. I had a great experience there & will continue to go there for all my cars needs!<//Review>

I just moved to California a few months ago and a friend recommended this Meineke for my auto service needs. I'm so glad they did! This is the only place I go they're always in such great moods and have great attitudes about everything. I never feel like I wouldn't be able to trust them and I know they're giving me the best deal. - Highly recommend.< /review>

<rate>2<//rate><Text>Not really a good place to get your car services to be honest. There are better and bigger American name auto shops to go to. Parts and labor costs were higher than expected. Cheap $20 oil change rope a dope tactics. The car gets inspected they push their recommended car service onto you. Wait time was ok and the mechanics seemed prompt and honest. The manager however wasn’t a people person. Probably never had a managerial position before. The place seemed dead which was why I was reluctant to come by in the first place. Now I know why its like that</Text>< Pictures>

I’ve been coming here for years. They always take great care of me. When I went to the dealer for a problem, they lied and tried to rip me off. I went to Meineke and they sorted it out in about five minutes and charged me less than half of what Northridge Toyota wanted to. Customer for life.</text>

If I could give less than 1 star,  I would. I took my car here in October for a full synthetic oil change, came back in March for the next appointment and was overcharged. I didn't bring the breakdown of payment but showed them my credit card purchase amount and that it was much less than what they charged me now. Rather than Sales looking up my last vehicle check in history, by my license plate, they just rudely said you used a discount which I didn't nor did they verify. Rather than confirm they were smug and dismissive. Not a big deal but will take my business elsewhere. No thanks.<//review>

Maggie our service rep on Devonshire in Northridge, CA was outstanding! Her customer service was unbelievable which is “RARE” these days. She obviously had a passion for cars as well as being so knowledgeable about the wear and tear and preventative maintenance. In our household she is our customer service champion of the month and we will continue to bring our 3 cars to her. OUTSTANDING!!!< /Text>

The customer service and auto repair that I received at this shop was fantastic.  Magi went out of her way to keep me updated on the progress of the repairs. The mechanic took time to explain to me the work that had be done. He also showed me the broken parts that were taken off of my vehicle. I was very pleased with the outcome.  Meineke Northridge will be my auto repair shop going forward.  I highly recommend them.< /review>

Harry was very good in explaining what the problem was with my car and what needed to be done.He was able to special order the part that was needed and finished the job the same day.
Also, he could have easily told me the first option of fixing the problem didn't work, so he had to go to the 2nd option (which was much more expensive) but he didn't do that. I really appreciated that! And I highly recommend Harry and Meineke in Devonshire St..
in Northridge, CA.< /text>

<Date>1565316085405</Date><Text>I went in for a brake ($30) and AC ($70) inspection. They fixed the problem: my boots and drums needed replacing. The mechanic was pleasant and very informative. Meineke was able to identify the problem, when Pep boys was not. The total for the brakes was $445 before tax. I arrived at 9:30am, and left at 3pm. The only offense I took to was how pushy the sales rep was. I get trying to make additional sales, that's what sales reps do, but this rep was rude in the process of selling. Her sales pitch was that maybe the pads were making the screeching noise, and that ceramic would be better...but it was later determined that the screeching came from the rear brakes. I said no multiple times to changing my pads, as it wasn't necessary, and it would have cost too much. She even suggested I apply for a credit loan through some third party company. I felt harassed, and aggravated. She took my no to the pads as a no to everything. We were clearly talking about skipping on the pads replacement, but she still only wrote me up for the inspections, and had my car brought out of the garage. I noticed and asked why, and she rudely said that it was because I said no to the brake job. I told her I said no to the pads replacement. I never said no to the rear brakes replacement. She was so caught up in making a sale, that she was ready to push me out. She was rude to other customers that came in. She has a very cold demeanor. Very unfriendly. Experiences like this is why I hate going to small mechanic shops, but I didn’t expect this from a chain shop. I’m already paying top dollar, and yet I am still being pressured to spend more than I need/want to spend, all while guilt tripping me. The manager actually harassed one of the customers while I was there, saying “what’s the point of having a $40,000 car, and not get the best oil change” (synthetic). I thought that was uncalled for. The customer had said no, and that should have been the end of the conversation...the end of the sales pitch. Anyway, the mechanic was great, but I obviously can’t say the same for the people in the office.< /Text>< response>

<review>MUST READ!!!!!!! Reason I went in  my car  made a horrible squeak sound when I would brake it’s the most annoying sound you could hear if you love your car, I went to 3 shops no one could pinpoint what it was before coming to Meineke ,I went to Firestone don’t go there they don’t know what they are doing they did the front pads and rotors sound never went away coming to Meineke they showed me how Firestone did not clean or lube anything it was a mess under there I got brand new pads and rotors shims the entire kit that Firestone did not provide Meineke took care of me and my car brought back peace of mind now it runs smoothly not one noise quality job done to excellence they are professional men in their area of work this is my new place and only place to go to you won’t be disappointed trust me quality and excellence, price is fair & good<//review>< name>

<Text>Two stars , only because the gal who works the front desk was super chill/helpful. I’m glad they fixed what needed to be done (back break pads, rotors, and two belts under the hood) but $700 for all parts and labor is ridiculous. They do have great quality parts and mechanics, but the price of parts and labor is BULL. I’m really bothered by that. Won’t be going back again.< /Text><GmapID>0x80c29b5ba463aa7f:0x9b5241825143c37f<//GmapID>< response>

Don't go to this place.
I went there to do the transmission oil change last week. Later I found out I already did transmission oil change in Feb 2018 at here. If Walter was honest person, he should have told me I already did the transmission oil change. I also waited 6 hours even though I had made an appointment at that day. He said that oil was was coming to the shop. After waiting 6 hours for the transmission oil change, he told me he will give me big discounts because of the incident. He still charged me $199 for the transmission oil change even though I didn't need it.. My car is 2015 prius. I spent so much money here before. I changed brakes and tires and changed the shocks and struts before. Anyway,  I went to this place to get a refund, Walter and another staff had an attitude and said he still gave me an big discount and cannot give me refund. I told him I couldn't work for 6 hours because of that. Walter said that was not his problem and don't care about that. It is company policy. I will never go to this place.< /text>

It was my first time there. Very friendly manager and a quick oil change. They work hard to make you happy so you can be a loyal customer. Great price on the oil change  (45%off meineke anniversary special.) No hard-sell tactics.  I will definitely return.</review>

Great service. I went here because I received a free oil change coupon from T-Mobile Tuesday. However, I bought my own Mobil 1 Extended Performance Synthetic Oil & related Filter and had them use that and perform an inspection of my car. I'll go again. The only thing missing was the free carwash that many oil change places offer.</Text>

I went to this Meineke location to take advantage of an oil change special.  They got the job done for me and told me there was a problem with the emissions system, but it was too late in the day for them to investigate it.  I searched the site more on Google and saw some of the negative reviews.  Honestly, it is hard to know what to think from reviews with the mix of good and bad.  In the end I went to a Firestone location because one of the things Walter told me could be wrong is a gasket and I had some work done there, so I wanted Firestone to rule that it out.  It turned out that the muffler was broken.

I think like many people there is a concern that someone at an autoshop will try to get to you to do unnecessary work.   I am grateful to Walter for alerting me to the problem.

Ultimately, I got a recommendation to another shop with a slightly better price, and that is a bit more convenient for me.  I am one of the people that has to make dollars stretch.  However, I am definitely going to keep this Meineke in mind for future automotive needs.  I think one thing people might need to keep in mind in reading negative reviews is that people working at auto-shops can have bad days too . . .  there are times things go things can wrong.

My own experience was courteous service, and being given valuable, accurate information.  Thank you Walter and crew at Northridge, Meineke.<//review>

Took my car in for an oil change and a brake inspection. The guys there got me in and out in a reasonable amount of time and at an even more reasonable price. They managed to save me money by  machining my rotors instead of replacing them and now my brakes are back to working the way they should.

I will definitely be bringing all my cars here from now on.< /review>

<Review>After my dealer quoted me an ungodly amount for a "repair", I decided to take my car to the guys at Meineke for inspection. The manager, Amado, was super accommodating and the mechanic who worked with me, John, was very informative. They went over my dealer's diagnosis point by point and found that it was hugely exaggerated. There was nothing out of the realm of ordinary wear and tear. Meineke saved me from getting cheated out of a huge amount of money. These guys earned my trust, and they definitely made a new customer in me. Now I know why my landlady recommended them!<//Review></record>

When I called to ask if they could handle my problem the guy offered a free checkup and inspection, but when I was about to leave he charged me for 115 dollars. It's awful to lure customers with fake promises. Even though the service was good, I left extremely mad because they deceived me.<//review>

Not happy, after 8 years being a loyal customer. Present problem that brought me in was shimmying of car when brakes were applied. Initial diagnosis--replace wheel cylinders and adjust rear brakes.Paid $254. PROBLEM NOT SOLVED. Came back, paid another $128 for new rear drums.PROBLEM NOT SOLVED. Came back, paid another $206 for new front pads and rotors. PROBLEM NOT SOLVED. Came back and manager wanted to inspect my suspension system, possible problems and more charges. I declined. Took the vehicle to another mechanic who just did a simple rear brake job for $220, replacing all new partS originally installed by Meineke, PROBLEM SOLVED. Long story short, Meineke  did their best to fix the problem, they did rework all of their faulty work, and they did honor their warranties, BUT THEY DID FAIL TO FIX THE ORIGINAL PROBLEM of what turns out to be an additional $550, for which they refused to refund even a portion of it. Corporate office was no help in trying to mediate the problem. Good bye Meineke from a long loyal customer.<//review>

<Text>I want to start out by saying "Thank you Meineke."
After months of headaches and stress of dealing with my 1990 Cadillac Coupe DeVille, the techs here were able to resolve my issues and get my vehicle running to factory specs if not better in a couple of days. My Caddy drives and sounds better than I can recall. I tried the following:
Replaced Electronic Control Module, battery, fuel injectors, fuel filter, fuel line o-rings, spark plugs and wires, cap and rotor, oil change, serviced transmission, and other parts forums would recommend. After all this work and money, I still had power loss and a sluggish sputtering Cadillac.  Techs kept me informed of the progress and findings. Ran all the necessary tests and found the issues. Their service is great and the cost to repair was well within my budget and fair. I highly recommend this repair center.

Thank you Amado (Manager), Jay (Tech), and Javier (Tech).< /Text><rate>5</rate><time>1482986857866<//time></record></dataset><record>

I made an appointment with Oscar for Saturday, July 12 to have my car inspected. I arrived and told him that my exhaust was leaking. Thirty minutes went by and I was told that my car needed further inspection and that it would cost me a fee of $110 dollars. The fee would go towards the repairs once they found out what it was. Previously, I had told them what problem I had and needed to know what it would cost me. Unfortunately, the employees of Meineke are told to lie to get the fee of $110 no matter if the customer does not get the job done there. I would NOT recommend going there. By the way, I went to a muffler shop and there was a leak. The cost to fix it was $80. Before going there if they can't find out what's wrong go somewhere else. There's a lot of shops and few honest people. Go with your gut and Good Luck.</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Wonderful customer service, i needed new brakes and rotors and when i called i was told to come in and get a free inspection, when i got there the owner inspected my car and Walter gave me a REALLLLLY good deal. I was there for a total of 1hr and 20mins, 20min wait time; i came and a hour of closing time, and a 1hr of service. And that’s including ordering my parts and installing them, for there to be only two people at that time they were moving fast, i would be coming back. Thanks guys 😁<//Text>

The manger was fantastic! I needed all new brakes coming from out of town I knew no one auto zone directed me to them amd now I will most definitely be using them again as well as sending more ppl their way. Trustworthy honest people in a hard business to find such people. Very very thankful for their hard work they saved my birthday 😄<//Review>

I went in for an oil change. They told me I needed new brakes. I previously had NO issues with my car or heard any noises other than the brake light occasionally coming on while driving. But stupidly I believed them and without a second opinion allowed them to replace my brakes. After about a day of driving I began to hear a faint noise that I assumed was another problem that they (probably falsely) told me my car had. But by the end of the day my wheels had completely locked up resulting in me almost hitting another car in a crowded parking lot.
When I called AAA to tow my car, the tow truck driver looked at my wheel and said "I hope you know how to sue people. Whoever did this to your car is stupid".  He told me they didn't tighten the caliber and the bolt became loose and FELL OFF. AAA told me that it was up to the mechanic to tow the car in situations where they are liable. He canceled the order and left me at the parking lot. I had to get a lyft home at 2AM!
I called Meineke first thing the next morning (7:30AM) and told them what happened and that they needed to send a tow truck. They didn't call me back until after 12noon! By then I had to go to work. They said they would call me by 10AM the next day.  By 10:30 the next day they still hadn't called.
When I finally called and spoke to Amado, he argued with me a lot and made it seem like the whole situation was MY fault and not theirs for incorrectly installing my brakes. He even said "You have to understand we're human we make mistakes" and blamed me for not bringing my car in sooner when the window between my first hearing the noise and the wheels locking up was like 4 hours (between 2:30-6:30pm), I was at work for most of that time, they closed at 6:30, and I thought the noise was from a different problem that his shop claimed I had.  He then tried to get me to pay for the tow truck and acted like he wasn't going to tow the car if I didn't pay for some of it.  After I told him exactly what AAA said then he finally ordered the tow truck.
When I met the tow truck driver at the lot, even he was visibly astonished at the condition of my vehicle and kept saying "why did they leave it like that".
When I got to the Meineke Amado apologized for his attitude on the phone with me that morning because he had "a lot going on".  He kept mentioning how much he had to pay for the tow truck. Like I was supposed to be thankful or something when none of this was my fault.  He should have been offering additional compensation like a refund for the completely third-rate brake job that I probably never even needed in the first place. He said he would test drive it himself. After about 2-3 hours they "fixed it" and then some very young guy is driving my car and I said "I thought Amado was going to test drive it".  Then after that Amado test drives it and claims that everything is okay.
After about 10 days I begin to hear the noise AGAIN. I take the car to a different mechanic and explain what has already transpired. The new mechanic told me that 1. The caliber was STILL loose and 2. MEINEKE PUT THE WRONG SIZED BOLT ON THE CAR AND IT WAS DAMAGING THE THREADS ON THE CALIBER!!
He said that I was lucky that he was able to salvage the threads or else he would have had to replace the whole caliber.
I feel so stupid that I let them talk me into a brake job without a second opinion. I trusted them because I had been there before and they were nice and helpful. I will NEVER GO BACK THERE AGAIN and I really think they should be shut down until they can hire a competent staff. They are PUTTING PEOPLE'S LIVES AT RISK and damaging people's vehicles.  On top of the fact they are probably misdiagnosing car problems for the sake of pocketing more cash.
I have filed a complaint with the corporate office and I really hope they can remedy this situation. This has been a terrible nightmare of an experience for me.< /text>

<Review>Great Experience! I took my Toyota Land Cruiser  there with a complicated electrical problem. I had previously taken the vehicle to other mechanics for this same issue but they could not find the source of the breakdown. At Meineke, the manager, Amado assured me that they would resolve the issue. they very methodically went through the whole electrical system, step-by-step until they found the source of the problem. Both Amado, the manager and his technician kept me informed throughout the process by communicating with me either in person or by phone and gave me progress reports and finally fixed the problem.
Amado is very professional and friendly and with his techs provide great customer care; I will be back if need arises</Review></record>

My exhaust was pushed in and melting my bumper.  The mechanic was crafty and figured out a way to bring both custom tail pipes out so the heat would melt the bumper.  I like how they worked out a solution.  price wasn't bad either.< /review>

Took my car in to get an inspection. Looks like everything passed except the brakes and the tires. I checked the tires myself when I got home and got another opinion as well. My tires are fine after measuring the tread myself. It looks like the person who originally inspected it gave it a pass.
But Alex Valle at the front counter is a scammer and crossed out the pass mark, then marked failed. He is the son of the owner. The same thing happened for the brakes. It was marked passed but greedy Alex crossed it out and marked failed. This is why a lot of repair shops are not trusted because people like Alex will make you spend money on something that you shouldn't have to. BEWARE OF THIS SHOP!!!<//Review>

Be careful.  I asked them to check my fluids and if low I would like them replaced.  I had to leave town on business and while my lady was driving the car, It overheated.  They didn't refill anything they said they did.  But they did hand me a huge invoice.  Will never go back to these guys.< /review>

<user_name>Steph Rubio<//user_name><Response>None</Response><Time>1488219210887< /Time><Pictures>None</Pictures><review>I went here to get my brakes done and I had a horrible experience. My brakes were making noise so I brought my car in and they told me all of them need to be replaced but the rotors could be resurfaced. I said ok and i left while they did their work. When i came back to pick up my car everything seemed fine. The next few days my brakes started to squeel only in reverse throughout the day. I called to ask what was going on and they asked me a serious of questions and they told me to bring it in. I called a mechanic for a second opinion and he told me to feel the rotors and if they feel like you are feeling a smooth glass top then they didnt resurface them. 3 of my rotors felt like a smooth glass top except for one. When i went in i explained what i was told and how i felt like i was lied to, the manager got upset and told me i voided the warrenty. Really? Just by touching the rotors with my finger? He then stated that since i was his customer, he would take care of me. He took my car in so I waited in the lobby this time. After 30 minutes they resurfaced again so it should be fine. I leave and literally a block away, not only is the squeeling still there but now there is a hissing noise coming from front. I call and tell them ill be back im a hour to have it looked at again. This time i bring my boyfriend with me and thats when their attitude changed. When they asked any questions or needed information, they would go straight to my boyfriend. This time my car was fixed in 20 minutes and they gave me a free oil change for the inconvenience. On the sheet that they give you about your car and what needs attention they stated that all 4 tires need attention. I asked why this changed within a week from only being the back the tires to now all 4? His response was that everyone measures differently! I told him i just replaced the front driver tire a month ago due to an accident so there is no way that it needs to be replaced. He just said oh and measured again then stated the front two were fine. I would also like to note that on the first inspection report they said only the brakes and back tires and within a week they added a few extra things! Did they even check my car at all? Now my brakes are squealing again in reverse throughout the day. I refuse to go back to this place, I don't care if I void the warranty.  I rather go to the dealer and pay more money for quality work. After doing some research, I found out that they have an account with Pep Boys. What they do is they purchase the cheapest brakes possible so they make a really good profit off of the labor. After speaking to one of the managers at Pep Boys they told me that they pretty much made about a $200 profit off of me because of the brakes they purchased. I have called and emailed corporate and have yet to receive a response. Avoid this place at all costs because you will have to spend more money to correct the issues they caused your car. Also they practically beg for you to write a Yelp review like a used car salesman because they are trying to improve their business. Instead of begging, try doing quality work and the reviews will come.< /review><user>101847910908619025637<//user><Gmap_id>0x80c29b5ba463aa7f:0x9b5241825143c37f<//Gmap_id><rating>1< /rating></record></dataset><record>

<text>I got the Denver omelet and it was so good. I would recommend to try this place if you're out of state and want something good, you won't find it at home. Small place but the servings are a good size.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

< review>
Loved the 101 Cafe!  Came for lunch on a weekend, not knowing what to expect.  The staff was very friendly and attentive.  They have limited inside seating with outside seating to make up for it.  The food was served quickly and was absolutely delicious!  The onions rings are amazing!  The patty melt was cooked perfectly!  Will be back to try breakfast here as well!<//review>

<Text>Great portions and food quality for the price. Reminds me of the northeast, where you can hit a family style diner and not spend a lot. Came here when it was busy on a Saturday morning and service was pretty good despite the serving staff having to attend both indoor and outdoor guests.</Text></record></dataset><record>

The staff was very friendly, and the food was delicious! It was great sitting outside in the wonderful weather enjoying brunch and the sea breeze. Highly recommended if you want a nice setting but without all the tourists.< /review>

Was nice to eat out. First time in 10 months. They have a nice set up in the parking lot. Traffic is a little noisy. Staff so nice. Buger was better than some. My eggs Benedict were cooked perfect.....but served on a burnt English muffin. Was still nice to get out.</Text>

<text>Got breakfast here and it was the worst I have ever had. We got the chicken fried steak and a cinnamon roll. It was cold, had almost zero gravy. The steak was a nasty mush like dog food. The potatoes were plain, out of the bag frozen squares with zero gravy to disguise it. The cinnamon bun was something cold out of a plastic bag, probably from 7-11. 0 stars. I could barely eat it and I will eat just about anything. Avoid breakfast here!! Don's or Mary's has excellent chicken fried steak if that is what you crave. It's real cooked food and delicious.< /text>< userid>

I had the corn beef hash and eggs with hash browns.  They served the hash crispy like I asked for it.  Yum.  My wife likes her bacon served in the crispy almost to the original carbon form.  Bingo.  They did it just right.</text>< Pics>

2nd time visiting 101 Cafe back in 2016 was when we discovered it. I have been craving this place for months now. I very scared this place might of not make due to 😷🦠☣️

LUCK FOR US its open for business cute temporary outside patio next to the 101 route

I got Driving South a$12.00 dish
Chicken fried stake covered is county gravy 2 eggs your choice of style house potatoes

Highly recommend it

<Time>1549142504209<//Time><Rate>3<//Rate><Review>Iconic Diner in downtown Oceanside. Very cool retro vibe with stainless steel tables and lots of history but the food was quite sub-par. My pork chops were like shoe leather and so was my husband’s ham steak. The bread was old. Such a disappointment in terms of food... and the bathrooms are outside across the parking lot. They do give you the quarter to put in for the bathroom.

I wouldn’t have minded the bathrooms so much if the food had been higher quality.

Despite all this, they were very busy.</Review>< Pictures>

<text>Best local joint by far! Been a customer for years, and i’ll Always make this a MUST STOP place when in town. We no longer reside in Oceanside, so EVERY time we’re in town, this is out go-to for breakfast or lunch. Love the food, love the staff...just LOVE this cafe! I always recommend this to anyone when they tell me they’re going to Oceanside. You won’t find a more welcoming place!<//text>< pics>

The quality of food and pricing was on point! Ya never want to go where you over paid and your still hungry. This place for the amount of money and portion size as well as quality of food makes it worth it. Friendly staff. Serves quick! What makes this food unique. After you eat you feel a good full. And no food coma as if it a heavy food!

Update: I always give credit when it's due. This place is one of my favorite local places of Oceanside CA. Fresh,  attentive, friendly. Parking lot is small. But when you come on the downtime. It's a nice lovely cosey place to have lunch and breakfast. You can ask the waiter or waitress what they recommend and they will give you there opinion because they tried it! Keep it up! Oh fyi just make sure you get the French fries underneath the table clean!</Text>

<Text>It's a classic local dinner. Get a Coke and some classic fries. The chili is great. I mean, this place has been the same since I was a kid! The portions are not massive, so don't expect to share to many fries. But it's great!< /Text>< pics>

For a quick look back in time at life in Oceanside stop in and grab a bite while the friendly staff in the photo share a few peeks of Oceanside's history. Don't forget to try the malts with your home cooked meal, done like mom made back then.<//Text>

I’ve been to this small restaurant more than a few times and have even ordered food to-go. It has always been a great experience with the staff, good food, and environment. I have had food ranging from the Classic French toast to the South of the Border machaca and have never been disappointed, delicious range of dishes. I would defiantly recommend this place to be a fast choice on a dinner date or to bringing the whole family. I look forward to eating here next, see you soon!</Text>

Save your money and go to either Don's or Mary's!I got the chicken fried steak and my partner got the biscuits and gravy. The food was just frozen food. There are so many great diners in oceanside. Skip this one. I expect fresh food, not frozen!<//Review>

A tasty diner that feels like it did when it opened decades ago. You'll definitely feel like you have stepped back in time when you step through the doors here. Staff was friendly and attentive and quick. The food was good, but pretty standard for a diner. They won't surprise you with weird gourmet options, but you will find all the traditional favorites here.</Text>

Updated Review: Extremely impressed with the owner's prompt response and willingness to fix an issue my husband and I had after making a trip to Oceanside from Orange County. For this reason, I am changing my previous review and giving them 5 stars! We would love to return again soon!

Great open air cafe. Fantastic food,  portions and service. Highly recommend for breakfast.

** Fair warning though,  no indoor restroom so if it's raining,  be prepared to walk across the parking lot. They will however give you a quarter for the paid restroom.</review>

Good breakfast food. We had a big group (7.5) and they were able to accommodate us by putting us in booths across from each other.  Cute surf decor, very nostalgic to old beach town</text>

We were on our way to beach break cafe and the line was out the door. I had remembered seeing 101 Cafe in our way to it and suggested we go there. SO HAPPY we did! Everybody in our group decides the food was better and the vibe of the place was awesome.< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

<Review>Food was horrible, waitress brought wrong items, the coffee cake could be fired out of a cannon it was so dense. The decor is awesome, but when your view goes from the pictures to the ceiling fans, watch out!! It looks like YEARS of dust, grease and filth are caked on the blades. The potatoes had absolutely no seasoning, my wife's "salad" looked as if it were poured out of a half-priced iceberg lettuce mix bag with three sad cherry tomatoes on the side. You can get better tasting tuna out of a can or at Subway. The coffee cake was so vile, I took a few chews and had to spit it out.< /Review>< username>

Small, quaint breakfast and lunch shop right on coast Highway 101 in Oceanside California. This little place does not have any ocean views, being about 1/8 mile from the coast. However, food was reasonably priced and very good. Waitress was friendly, attractive, and efficient. The parking is free.< /Text>

Really good service, delish thick fries and coffee.  Egg salad sandwich was good but thin on the egg salad part. Bathroom is outside across from the parking lot and requires a quarter... they’ll give you the quarter and the bathroom is very clean.  American dining for breakfast, lunch and dinner.<//Review>

<review>Love this place for its location, its history, and the food....but last few times I've gone the service was, well it wasn't too friendly. Staff always leave you hanging unless your a regular or family, and its hard to ask for something because they never look around enough or ask. Especially when its full house, I get it, busy, but gotta make time for your guests. Still its a good place to grub and the location is great, hopefully it changes a bit.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x80dc6e3cd4eb9efd:0x6a97bf2e25d3cb2e</gmapID></record>

So, I have not been here since 1995. Since I'm out here working I decide to stop by.  Love that it is still pretty much the same!! Got breakfast, green Chile omelette. Very good. I recommend it. The service was excellent. Back to the omelette, did I mention it was freaking tasty,lol. Stop by and check it out. I'll be back.< /review>

Wendell was so friendly and made my family feel at home 800 miles away from where we live in Colorado. The place had a great atmosphere, even better staff, and to top it all off, the food was delicious as Well! Highly recommend!!< /text>

<Text>We are on a vacation and decided to come here and grab a bite. We saw this cafe when we were driving around and wanted to come for breakfast. The service was not too great and we had to grab our own menus before the waitress had come outside to take our drink order. We waited over 25 minutes to get our drink order and sat there almost a hour before we got our food. The tea didn't taste fresh and the coffee was average. Our food was alright, but didn't settle well prior to eating. We sat outside so we didn't experience the retro vibe. Maybe they were having a bad day because all the reviews seem good.<//Text></record>

Mediocre food and awful iced tea. They should seek our the tropocal brand tea that many cafes offer. The server was great so that lifted the experience to a 3.< /Review>

My boyfriend is stationed at Camp Pendleton, and everytime I come to visit we eat here just about every single morning for breakfast! And, we absolutely love it!!!!! The pile up is amazing and the coffee is probably the best I have ever had! They have the most friendly service, we love Maddie, and the food is amazing! We love 101 Cafe!!!!</Text>

A definite slice of Americana.  Cute roadside diner with stainless steel tables--cool to lean on the tables indoors when it's hot outside!  The place is small and there may be a wait on weekends.  Nevertheless worth a stop when you're in that 50s diner kind of mood.  I liked the ham and egg scramble for breakfast.<//text>

< Review>
good vegetarian options, although the corned beef hash here reputedly is the best in town; shakes and floats come in one size: ridiculous<//Review>

<text>Killer breakfast, we've been there twice. Quant little place, we shared an omelette, and instead of them cutting one in half, they gave us each our own little ones. It was a really thoughtful way to split an otherwise huge breakfast!<//text><date>1519867401564</date><username>Stacy Dow< /username><Rate>5< /Rate>< Gmap_id>

These old historic diners are slowly disappearing but this one endures. Big meals so think of sharing if you don't have a big appetite. Gets busy here in the morning. Egg dishes are good but their biscuits and gravy is a winner.< /text>

Busy Sunday morning the staff worked hard to get all 7 of us a place to sit in this small place. Very good food. Try Jan's raspberry coffee cake- not what you expect but really good!</Review>

Worst burger I've ever eaten, asked for medium, came shriveled and burnt by the lousiest server, cant really call her that. There was an old woman cleaning tables, while the child served was trying to make shakes from ice milk with syrup added to make flavored. Can't afford ice cream? Or a real burger party, this anorexic burger couldn't be cooked medium because it's so small, if you flip it once, it's well done! Run elsewhere! Beachbreak on Cassidy right up the street!<//review><Date>1532035580357< /Date><gmapID>0x80dc6e3cd4eb9efd:0x6a97bf2e25d3cb2e< /gmapID><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>
{'time': 1532565021048, 'text': 'Ronna, I’m sorry your experience wasn’t the best.  But I can reassure you that we use real ice cream and nothing else (thriftys to be extract). As far as syrups we like to add certain flavors to it nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nWe are sorry that your burger didn’t come out  as you would have like it. We could have easily remade it for you if you would have let your server know.\n\nFor our burger we use 100% angus beef which we hand patty to 5oz, it cost us a little more then the regular we try to provide quality products to our guest.\n\nAs the old women you mentioned, well that one of the owners. She a hands owner that works side by side her employee to try and make the 101 cafe as best as possible for all our guest.\n\nOnce again we are sorry that your personal experience at the 101 fell short of your expectations. We will use this review to help our crew understand that one miss step service and in our food preparation can turn a promising experience into and not so one.\n\nThank you for your comments Ronna and have a wonderful day!'}<//Resp>

We love this place. Right on highway 1 and blocks from the ocean it is always cool and sometimes crowded, but the service is consistently friendly. There are some different food choices on their menu and you can peruse the historic photos on the walls while you eat.< /Text>

I went to this diner today with my kids! Thought it looked very cute and retro definitely fits the Oceanside area. I was neglected by my waitress. It took me about 10 min to get a menu and when I went and grabbed one myself she seemed irritated. It took a little by time to get any kind of attention from her she walked with her head down and doesnt notice customers trying to get her attention. At one point someone who was also frustrated with her was trying to help me get her attention. My order was wrong also. The food was great. My only comment on my California omlet would be to break up the avacado. The whole one side was like a whole avacado. Didn’t mind too much because I love them.</Text>

<text>I moved to North County 9 years ago and happily found this place, it was good, 9 years ago. The place has gone down hill ever since in food quality, quantity and service only going up a steep hill in price. Today was, sad to say, definitely  my last visit. I have never received a smile here. Today was the first time I got my toast WITH breakfast instead of for desert but dang, it was burnt and really, really small. My daughters french toast was smaller than a slice of wonder bread. My complete breakfast was NOT GOOD. It took over 40 min. for us to get our food and our order was the only one for the kitchen at the time. "Regulars" seem to be treated better than the average joe as evidenced by today's regulars Buddy the bulldog and his owner whom were served immediately upon entering the restaurant. Yes, Buddy the dog was served dog food from behind the counter in the restaurant (Buddy probably ate the best of anyone there today). The current stone faced waitress whom has been there for a long time as far as I can remember, is bouncing all over the place looking busy enough yet nothing is really happening, except the dog is getting stellar service on the floor from her (we were stuck there for over an hour mainly waiting for food and the check) and with all the activity by the waitress feeding, petting the dog etc. I never once saw the waitress wash her hands!
So, a couple of flavorless eggs, cold undercooked sausage, burnt, mini, dry sourdough toast (they don't butter it for you) and mushy, starchy hashbrowns along with mini french toast, a cup of coffee, an orange juice from a carton and "dirty" service for $25.00 without so much as a thank you of even a smile?
THANKS BUT NO THANKS.</text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

A really fun breakfast spot, especially if you sit on the sidewalk tables or the patio out back. The food does not disappoint either, and the service is friendly and talkative</Text>

Chawndra is the best. She's a large part of the reason I eat there. The food is very good. I've been eating there for a long time. I'm 66 years old and washed dishes there when I was a sophomore at Oceanside High. In an unfriendly world it's a delight to see smiles and be dealt with in a friendly manner. Plus I think Chawndra is awesome. Oh yeah I already said that. LOL<//review>

<Rate>1<//Rate><review>I have been going to 101 for breakfast on sundays for the last year.  At first it was good but has steadily gone downhill in the last 6mos.  They don't cook with much seasoning so you have to really salt and pepper everything heavily.  The gravy is like tasteless paste.  Now they have started cutting back the portions and charging anywhere from 50c to 70c just to put a little extra gravy on the potatoes, which are dry so they need it.  On the last two visits, I noticed that the portions have been cut in at least half if not more.  I have eaten my last meal there.  It is just not worth the price anymore.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

<username>Paola Ojeda</username><time>1559847603048</time><rate>5< /rate><Review>(Translated by Google) This cafeteria seems to be frozen in the 50's and that is what gives it personality. The waiters attend you kindly. The food is simple, unpretentious and with good taste. I ordered 2 fried eggs with potatoes and toast (Solo Cruise in the menu) and it is just what I got. The mural that is outside is very beautiful and inside it is possible to see very old photos of Oceanside. The "diner" takes its name from the California U.S. Route 101 that goes from San Diego to Oregon.

Yo pedi 2 huevos estrellados con papas y pan tostado (Solo Cruise en el menu) y es justo lo que obtuve.  El mural que esta afuera es muy bonito y dentro es posible ver fotos muy viejas de Oceanside.
