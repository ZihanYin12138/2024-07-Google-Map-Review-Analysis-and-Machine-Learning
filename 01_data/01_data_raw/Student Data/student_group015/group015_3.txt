Was there a short 7 days. It was a pleasant experience they made everything very easy. It took time to get a bed. After that they took me in and helped me from the start. Great staff good energy. No bad vibes. Everyone helped me out when I was at a all time low. This was 8 months ago<//Review>

What IS here is a 1 hour lecture that does NOT involve ANY aspect of recovery by a 20÷ (not much older) kid that isn't an addict OR ALCOHOLIC followed by a hour and a half consisting of 1 hour of rehashing and 30 minutes of music.

<Review>what a great experience !! With all these money hungry businesses & rehabilitation centers, it is SO refreshing to know that there are still places out there where helping people and making a difference remains their #1 goal!!! Cedar House being one of them! As easy going as I am, I have NEVER been able to officially say that every single person apart of an organization like this had all been great friendly & warm people.... until I came to Cedar House . Every single nurse, staff member, counselor, management, ladies at the front desk  you name it... They ALL truly exceeded my expectations !! As a client, when you are abruptly put into a facility to change your entire lifestyle, JUST THAT in itself can be the most draining challenge of all! Being tested physically, emotionally, mentally & spiritually... When you accomplish something this difficult, you never forget the kind beautiful & hardworking people that made it all possible.. For me, it was the beautiful staff here at Cedar House.  Every nurse that helped me through detox, was soooooo AMAZING, truly going out of their way to be sure I was as comfortable as possible. ANGIE & THE OTHER STAFF MEMBERS SHE WORKED WITH WILL ALWAYS HOLD A SPECIAL PLACE IN MY HEART. I RECOMMEND CEDAR HOUSE TO EVERYONE I KNOW THAT NEEDS TREATMENT !< /Review>< Pics>

CEDAR HOUSE WE TREAT YOU LIKE LOW LIFE TRASH  if I could have given a 0 star it would have gotten a 0 star this was my first experience at a rehab and it was the worst experience I've ever had after only 3 days I was thrown out on the Street because I had tested positive for opiates and when I got there I was positive for opiates because that's why I was going in in the first place I did try to plead with them to let me stay because I really wanted help and they told me the decision was final and that I needed to leave I think if I wanted to still use drugs I would never have come to a rehab in the first place. most of the staff there were rude as hell they treated me like I was lower than them and that they were better than me because they were not on drugs I only say most because there were the few that were really good but they were few and far between if anyone is thinking about going make sure you have privite insurance because I didn't even see them being tested<//review>

WARNING: Cedarhouse is a great program went threw withdraw management for a week before sadly being referred and transferred to Maple House down the street. I wish they never sent or recommend that treatment facility!!!!!! Don't understand why they are connected to such a  unethical, horrible ran program and facility!!!!!! Maple house make up their own rules and protocols violate your trust and HIPAA! Also bully and threats. WARNING! Stay at Cedar House!!!< /Text>

Paul O'Hearn for President!!!
Love you guys!!
Kitchen staff Rudy, David, Bonnie and even George's grumpy demeanor are the best in the west!
Vera, sincere and always goes above and beyond for the clients.
Men's Care specialists Are all professional.
Nursing staff needs a lil fine tuning but you cant win them all.
Thank you CHLCC.
You are my family and I'm in debt to you all.

Ceder house was a very helpful tool on my road to recovery.. Parole payed $100 a day for me to be there, and for that I will always be grateful. They spoon fed me a few nugget that I continue to apply today, one day at a time. Thank God, and thank the staff for giving me a life.<//review>

This place saved my life...I was completely hopeless when I came here. I had lost everything,  including myself. It was not easy, but with the help from Cedar House, I learned to love myself again. I stopped using and drinking and I found a whole new me. Thank you Cedar House!</text>

My son asked me for help on Christmas i called cedar house they have been unwilling to help me they hung up on my son when he called and they have been giving me the run around for the past 3 days they told me a ministration would be open today so he can get help i waited 3 days and they keep giving me the run around they are unwilling to help my son and keep hanging up on him i do not under stand why this place is open if they cant help someone who is asking for help the people that work there are rude, inconsiderate, and uncaring it really frustrates me that someone is asking for help and the poeple at the cedar house is unwilling to help someone that is struggling with a drug addiction< /text>

<Text>This place is my go to for deployment storage. The manager Wendy is absolutely incredible to work with. She was so helpful and kind from me first getting my unit all the way through checking out almost a year later. The facility is safe and very clean. Would highly recommend using this facility.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

I have been a long time customer of Cube Smart, approx 5 years.  During that time, I have had to upgrade my unit twice, which means move!
They are kind and accommodating, and assisted me to make the changes as smoothly as possible.  Efficient staff.  Christian is A-plus in my book.
I feel it is safe and kept up.  Thank you Cube Smart!</Text>

< Review>
I rented a space for the last few months for the holidays season and dealt Jim at  1625 W Vista Way. Jim very polite and helpful in showing me what was available.  Jim was very detailed and he answered all my question  so i was able to select a unit that was best suited for my needs. everything ran smoothy for the first month and then i forgot to set up auto pay.   After i was Promptly notified by Jade that i was Late on paying my bill. I called to set up auto Pay. Lucky for me Jade answered the phone and she was extremely helpful  with her Pollyanna ism attitude in resolving the issue and setting up auto pay.  I got to say the over all experience was extremely delightful.  these two individuals are incredibly polite and professional.  I would refer them and your storage facility to anyone I know.  they deserve a raise!</Review>

<Review>I think the staff here are courteous and professional, the units are clean inside and out, it feels quiet and safe, but that's about the only things going for this storage facility. I think the prices are about average. The main problem I have here is the hours. They close at 10pm EVERY night, weekends included. They don't open until 8am. Personally I think the hours should be 10-11 during the week and midnight on the weekends. I also feel like opening up at 5-6 am during the week and no later than 7am on weekeds would be more convenient for customers. We once went on a Saturday and wrongly assumed hours were extended on weekends like every other storage facility, and found ourselves "locked" in at 10:30pm. Of course, we were able to get out through the side gate, but the management ended up charging us $50 for being on grounds 30 mins after closing! Unbelievable!!<//Review>< user_id>

I have been a customer of CubeSmart for quite awhile and this location on Vista Way had superb employees that were eager to help, but when my valued items got wet & ruined, they changed.  The first unit they were going to transfer me to was rented to someone else, took several more weeks to get another one, but not the same size...bigger which meant more money, it took their claims dept months to finalize a claim completely under valuing my antique items that were ruined!</text>

I'll give them 5 Stars for a beautiful clean facility & nice Staff right off the 78.  They called to tell me my lock wasn't on right.  I went right over & secured my lock and also went over the next day day to THANK  them.  Guess they routinely check locks on storage bins.  I'm happy with them!< /text>

Tim is the best! I unexpectedly needed a storage unit and CubeSmart offered the best rate for the storage space I am renting. I was short on time and every thing was done so quickly I could hardly believe I was in and out of the office in just minutes. I strongly recommend CubeSmart if you are looking for a secured storage unit.</text>

I've had luck with finding first floor units for easy access and the location is right off the free way.

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>Excellent staff. I had to move my company storage here from Cleveland. The guys were amazing and received all my packages. This service is unprecedented and well worth the price. In comparison to other storages they definitely provide a lot of services for even a lower price than any other place around. Very convenient and safe, to my pleasure next to a car wash with free vacuums. :)  I am glad I stopped here and that our business was valued by the staff here.<//Text>< username>

Both Tim and Jim have been extremely helpful over the past five and a half years. Cube Smart has competitive rates, but most importantly, they offer longer and later hours which is very convenient. Also, the whole facility is clean and is well lit. As far as storage units go, this is the place to have one.<//Review>

Only disappointment was to find out that there is no lighting in the 10x10 on the second floor.  (elevator is very hight inside - maybe 12-13 feet?)  Well kept, managed and accessible.

<review>We signed up online initially and Jim confirmed with us.  He was fantastic at following up, and was very flexible as we had to change our move in time/date, and upgrade to a larger unit. The check in process was quick and painless and would definitely refer this storage facility to anyone needing one in the future.

Exceptional customer service across the board!!< /review>< UserId.>

You have to check in and out the carts and there are only 3, so it's a hit and miss thing. Inside units are hot as hell-no air. But very strict security so at least my junk feels safe. Hours of access suck. Will be leaving after month is up.</Review>

If you're military and deploying, this place gives you an incredible 50% discount. Also theres a free truck to help you move your stuff in. The only reason I left off a star is because the guy waited until I needed the truck the day of to tell me I had to be 25 to take it. Besides that, it's been wonderful. I'll update this review when I take my stuff out of storage!<//Text>

I have been a customer for several years and am currently in the process of relocating to another storage facility. They raise prices too frequently and charge unreasonable and ridiculous fees. I will never recommend them and highly discourage anyone from using this company for storage.
Worst storage facility I have ever had, save yourself some hassle and go elsewhere!<//text>

< review>
Came here for an oil chance. George tried to con me with slick verbiage into getting synthetic oil when my vehicle only needs conventional. "I assume you want synthetic oil". Nice try. I wonder how many people this place has over charged with this tactic. When I picked up my car George tried to give me the wrong key and when I told him that wasn't my key he got frustrated and used profanity. Not towards me but just about the situation. I know this is an auto shop and not a high end merchant but employees should still refrain from language like that. Guess I'm still looking for a decent place for an oil change in San diego.<//review>

I have been going to this shop for over 10 years. Oil changes, routine maintenance,  I haven't had issues with any of the staff as they are knowledgeable and honest.  If something is beyond their scope, they always have good recommendations. Very helpful.< /Review>

Came in for a muffler on a Saturday.  Jose and the guys were amazing.  Was driving back to Jersey.  Jose said it would be an hour.  Gave me a very fair price and even put on windshield wipers and checked fluids.  Highly recommend these guys.  Thank you and excellent work.< /Text>

<text>Put the wrong oil in my car. Brought the right oil. Car holds 4 quarts they put over five in it. Ask them to check on the problem I was having with my car. I said it is not wheel balance there is a worn part somewhere. Picked up the car they said there was a tire off balance. Started to drive it and it was even worse.  Took the car to True line in Santee. They found that there was a bad set of brand new tires on the car.<//text>< pictures>

Had my car here for oil change. Also asked them to look at the brakes. They were very honest, I knew the front brakes needed changing, but the rear was fairly new. They also agreed. I'll return here because they treated me great and didn't try to rip me off.<//Review>

Jose is the best! Very honest .. refreshing in a very shady industry, nice to have someone you can trust and refer!!! I watched him interact with customers for. Good hour, treated all with respect,made personal recommendations, recommend only what they needed no overselling!! Everyone left with a smile.. I would hire that guy in an instant.. I've seen people come and go but he's stood the test of time.< /Review>

<text>Made online appointment for a 19.99 oil change.  I got there and it was $42.76 "because they are not a participating midas in San Diego".
They didn't have a single customer all technicians were sitting down.   They rather make an extra 22.00 dollars and get a 1 star review  than do the oil  change and get a 5 star.< /text>< rate>

While on vacation to San Diego, our breaks began squeaking. We looked up midas and found this to be the only location still open. They were so kind to take us in 10 minutes before close and had 2 rotors and break pads replaced for us in less than an hour. The guys there were super nice and accommodating.< /text>

I can't thank the staff at Midas enough for their quick and friendly service! (Jose & Butch)
My family and I were visiting my son who lives here in San Diego from Burbank when we noticed we had a nail in our tire. I wanted to get it patched vs using my spare tire. When I called to see if they could help me Jose was very friendly and told me that his shop closes at 3pm but they would be more than happy to wait for me since I was on my way. He had Butch help me out and I was in and out in 10 minutes. I recommended that my son who lives in San Diego use him in the future for any automotive needs. Thank you Jose and Butch for your speedy and kind service so myself and my family could make it home to Burbank safely. 😉👍</review>

Just moved to the area and this is the closest location to us. Went to get an oil change and diagnostic done because the “service engine soon” light was on. They did the oil change but not the diagnostic. They said that was extra $$$ as the mechanic “doesn’t work for free”. Said the light could be the emissions “needing to be fixed” I took my keys and drove to my old location where they hooked up my car free of charge and told me the problem was that the gas cap was not on tight enough. Will not be going back to the Friars Rd location.< /Text>

I walked in this morning seeking a wheel alignment while I waited. I was told by what seemed like the manager that would they could do it within 45 minutes. So I agreed and sat for about 10 mins.

When it became apparent that the car would not be taken in all that quickly, I said something to the gentleman. He then said he needed 45-60 minutes.

I sat down, then went to the rest room. When I came out, I was handed my keys with a very strange comment 'you are too new.'   (whatever that means)

It was evident they didn't want to work on my car and didn't like me trying to hold them accountable for the original time frame they offered me.

I will never go back because of how I was treated. From here, I went down the street to Evans Tire and got an alignment easily and effortlessly.< /text>

Completely untrustworthy. I handed them my functioning key fob; 1 hour later it was broken. First they said "these things break all the time", then they told me I had broken it, basically lying and dodging responsibility.  After some discussion they stated the manager would call me the next day to credit my service. This call never happened. Apparently a $25 key fob is worth acting this shady. Save your money and go to a shop that isn't dishonest.<//Review>

Had been putting off an oil change and coolant flush, so when I received their coupon in the mail I decided I'd give it a try. I had gotten quotes for just the oil change at my dealership, my regular mechanic, and Soapy Joe's (Soapy Joes baited and switched a $19.99 oil change, so I left); all these places ended up being much more expensive than I'm willing to pay.

Went in and got the oil change written up for $24.99 just as the coupon advertised. Asked if I could use a second coupon for $20 off a fluid flush as well and they added it without any hassle. My car was in and out in less than two hours (they forgot to call me upon completion as requested) with both services completed for $99 bucks. They also provide a good vehicle inspection. Completely satisfied.< /Text>

The service was excellent.  I came in for an oil change and didn't feel pressured to buy any additional services.  They recommended a few other maintenance requirements and gave me addresses for where I could get them taken care of if I didn't want to use their services.  There is a strip mall across the street where you can amble around while you wait for your work to be done.  I will absolutely by returning here.

Edit July 2017: came in last weekend and was 'helped' by a guy named George - very un-personable and just shy of rude. Didn't tell me the wait wait would be more than 3 hours (my bad for not asking, but the waiting room only had 1 other person in it) - after 1 hour I asked sand left. Returned this weekend to be helped by the same guy and service was just as brusque - I very much felt like I was inconveniencing him by daring to come in to his store. Since everything about this place except George was great both last time and this time, I only lower my score to a 4, but I understand the people rating this place a 2.</text>

Waste of my time.. manager tried to pull a classic bait-and-switch on me. I called before driving there. He asked what kind of car then offered synthetic oil chg at $75 (other Midases are $10 cheaper) I went there. he said it'll be $13 more because my car takes 6 qts of oil!!? (Hello? What's the point of asking me what kind of car on the phone??) the Total?: $95
Called VW dealership while their unprofessional service tech was laughing and joking with customers in service bay while keeping me waiting..dealership charges $75. Took my keys and left because I didn't want to give them a penny of my money for pulling this BS during rush hour!
They not only lost a customer but referrals; I live across the street!!<//Review>

Dishonest, wasted my time and now my car still needs brakes. They knew the make and model of my car, what time that I was bringing it in, and that I had my 4 year old daughter with me and would need to wait nearby. Two hours after I took a taxi to Fashion Valley Mall I CALLED (they told me they would) to check on the car.  It was 5:14 (I dropped the car off at 3:15pm) and they said they didn't have the rotors in stock and that it would have to wait until the following day. Not only that, but by the time I wasted cab fare, and the fare I'll have to waste tomorrow to take it somewhere else (would your 4 year old wait 3 hours in a Midas? I didn't think so) I'll have spent the $100 in savings on pads that I would have accrued two years from now or whatever.  I am not price sensitive though, if you tell me you can fix my car, then you had better freaking fix it.  I would have paid $800 tonight for them to just have freaking fixed it.  It's the slow roll, shady, dishonest thing that I HATE.< /review>

Stopped in to get NEW rims and tires for my F150, they didn't have them in stock but had them in the shop within an hour, couldn't be happier, service was excellent.
Thanks.< /review>

I loved Sprint but hated the fact the with the I phone you can not be on a phone call and use your internet at the same time unless on WiFi ... it became very inconvenient.. although I loved the Sprint employees on Mitchelle rd in Ceres .....  So because you ARE able to use both features at the same time with T mobile is why I transferred... The T mobile store on Hatch rd in Modesto which is where I transferred over was great ... All employees very nice and Evelio the manager who helped me was great ... Thank you !!!!!</text>< Pictures>

Terrible customer service...I had to request to talk with manager 4 times. Until I asked for regional manager the manager came to assist me. I was only purchasing a new phone for an already established account and was told I needed to buy another sim. Sales clerk over charged me & said to cancel the transaction is would have to pay $50 restocking fee...neither of us had even opened the box up. After manager came out he fixed it with no apologies...just fixed the clerk mistake & didn't address me at all</Review>

1st off Jesse and his other Barber's do amazing work. The professionalism, cleanliness and the care in which they treat there customers are hands down 2nd too none. I'm not from L.A., I live in Bakersfield and I tried numerous barbers while I work in L.A.. I will not waste my time with any other shop.< /review>

<text>Everyone there is so kind! They all have great talent when it comes down to men and women haircuts! My husband has been going there since he was in middle school and now our son has been getting his hair cuts since he was 2 ( he’s now 6). All the barbers there treat you as if you were family! I highly recommend this place!</text>< pics>

Today I got my haircut. I had a long hair, so now I’m bald. Because of misunderstanding and non-proffecionalism. The barber doesn’t know how to communicate with the customer, she doesn’t know English. And I was telling her how cut hair properly. So I spend 1.5 hour,25$ and I’m not happy. I don’t suggest you this Barbershop!</text>

Had my 1st cut with jesse and was great. Went back for second cut but jesse was busy and this other gentleman took over. Asked for medium/ high fade and just messed my hair up. He went way up and when he cut the top with scissors hair was all misaligned . Didnt notice until i got home  and showered. It came to my attention that something was wrong when he took about 45 mins and kept cutting and cutting but though he liked to take his time. I was wrong he knew he messed up and tried to correct it.< /text>

<review>Absolutely the worst haircut I EVER received!! I asked the barber plain as day did he know how to cut my hair (ethnic male) he responded yes and when he began I could tell it was going to be a disaster. I literally had patches missing. Then the idiot had the nerve to ask me how I wanted it lined after I told him. I just got up and left with a messed up haircut and all..< /review><rate>1<//rate><user_id>102732256750463863746<//user_id></record></dataset><record>

I have been using H&R block online tax preparation service for years and it's always been free. Great interface, friendly support staff, and easy to do your taxes year after year especially the free file option. This past year, however, I hear rumors that they are starting to charge again.

I was skeptical because I've always had such a great experience, but I called and spoke to a representative to be sure. The rep said they hadn't changed anything and for my income bracket it would be free.

After spending the 2 some odd hours to do the taxes, at the very END of this form, I find out they are trying to charge me $80 something bucks! I was pretty upset, to say the least. I don't make a lot of money, and it's been a difficult 2020 (for everyone, I'm sure). I tried  reaching out to ask why, but got nothing other than an email saying "finish your taxes today, or the price will INCREASE!!!!"

Terrified of losing out on more money I needed for rent and food, I rushed through the final process. Only to find the state taxes would cost an extra $35! FINE whatever, no organic broccoli this week we'll have the store brand stuff.

Finally finishing up with this beautiful scam website - or so I thought - when at the VERY end it turns out there's an additional $45 for "online payment transfer." That's right, something the IRS does themselves with no issue for free - H&R block CHARGES YOU FOR.

AVOID these scummy people. AVOID this scammy website. Don't give these people any more money, they're the ones lobbying Congress to keep the tax code complex!!! Save your money, I think TurboTax is still free.</Review>

I am very confient in the ability of my tax person at H&R Block. Several years ago a different H&R Block preparer  made an error on my taxes. H&R Block coverd the additional expense to correct  the issue. I appreciated that.</Review>

Cathy is amazing. I love seeing her every year. She always gives me a courtesy call to book my appointment.  She always breaks things down for me and informs me of what I can do to help the following year. As long as she remains there I will continue to return to see her. Cathy always remembers my husband kids and myself. She's very professional and personable.  I always have a great experience with Cathy.<//Review>

<Text>This was my 2nd year with Josette Pyper.  She has been, and still is, efficient, well-versed in current tax laws, very competent, and accurate.  In addition, she is very friendly and makes one feel comfortable as she goes through the tax process.  I expect that she will continue to be my tax preparer for some time to come.< /Text>< Pictures>

Mike Teasley is THE best tax preparer that we have ever had in the 53 years of filing taxes. We would not want another to do our taxes but him.</text>

<review>This week we had an appointment with this office. These are suppose to be experts hence the reason we brought our taxes to them. This was by far the most obscene experience we have ever had. The women who attempted to help us was so a d d she could not stick to one question at a time. At the time we mentioned our LLC personal business she then went and got another associate who was rude, condescending, and impatient. He didn't even know who Legal Zoom was, a very reputable know company who one may file their LLC/ small business with. We requested he slow down a bit so we could understand him at which point he patronized us until we concluded they were so unorganized, not professional, and knew nothing about how to help us with our taxes. We had everything very well documented and organized so we were shocked to say the least! We took our business to H & R in La Costa and had an experience that exceeded our expectations. We do not recommend the Marron rd H&R to anyone!!!! The guy in the next booth was yelling at his receptionist the whole time until he came over to supposedly help us as our representative had no clue what she was doing. Not to mention she was like 70 years old and I could see down her entire blouse. She kept slipping around and was not focused at all. Tax time is very stressful and based on the way H&R advertises and usually delivers professional service beyond expectations. This one on Marron RD in Carlsbad does not live up to these standards. Hope this helps. Happy tax time everyone!<//review>< resp>

<review>Gerber Kawasaki took 350k-1m PPP loan that was designed for small businesses. So wealth management company that struggles to pay salaries to its employees? How can anyone trust them manage their assets after their publicly borrow money from the government? Also, stock market has been on up trend recent two months. If Gerber Kawasaki couldn't make profits to cover their own salaries during that time, than they shouldn't do any business in wealth management to begin with.<//review></record></dataset><record>

<Name>Lena Alvarez<//Name><Review>I have worked with GK for more than 10 years.  One thing that I really appreciate is that I’ve had the same financial advisor throughout, which shows their commitment to their clients.  Bryan Miranda is always available to answer my questions and responds same day.  Recently, I realized I had lost track of an old 401k.  He quickly helped me to call the retirement company and advised me on best next steps.  He will often make a recommendation but after thoroughly exploring and explaining all options.  I truly feel he has my best interest in mind.  I would highly recommend Gerber Kawasaki and specifically, Bryan Miranda if you’re looking for a professional financial advisor.</Review><UserId.>102600180543129449830< /UserId.><Gmap_id>0x80c2bb1c365a302f:0x1dce59e482f277b< /Gmap_id>< Pics>

Ben is endlessly available to answer all of my questions, big and small.  The quick replies and clarity instantly put my mind at ease.

Ben has encouraged me throughout this journey as I learn about the world of personal investment for the first time, and he’s always helped to guide the decisions we make together that make the most sense for where I am in my life, always with an eye towards the future and my goals.

<review>Had a great experience at Gerber Kawasaki. Met with Michael Baker and I couldn’t be happier starting my personal finance investments with him and this company! Michael was very easy to talk to as he helped me learn about my personal finances and help plan my future financial goals. He’s always been available to promptly answer any questions or concerns I have had! Investing can be a big decision but I’m happy to have made the decision to invest with a company who invests just as much to their clients as they do to their financial portfolio.</review><username>Kaitlin Kellum</username><Pics>None<//Pics>< GmapID>

I've been working with Gerber Kawasaki for over 4 years and they have been AMAZING! My Financial Adviser is Francine Lai and I'd recommend her to everyone. In fact, most of my friends now use her and are very happy with the service. She is very attentive, personable, and an expert in her field. She has been able to turn my investment to a high return! I feel very safe and comfortable with her expertise as she is one of the best in her field. I love the small shop feel but know how to play with the big boys. Definitely recommend them if you're looking for a Financial Adviser!<//Review>

<Review>I met with Brett a few months ago and we went over a comprehensive financial plan. From going over my net worth, to doing a budget, to crunching how much I need for retirement.. he made it all easy to understand and had great recommendations on how to improve my specific situation. I ended opening up a liquid and retirement account with Brett and I am proud to be a Gerber Kawasaki client. Keep up the good work!<//Review><name>RJ Guglielmo</name></record></dataset><record>

<text>Working with Ben Dunbar at Gerber Kawasaki has been one of the best financial choices I have ever made. He goes above and beyond to answer all my questions and has taught me so much about investing. Ben has set up different accounts for my different financial goals and I am confident I will be able to reach these goals with his help. I couldn't recommend working with him anymore.</text></record>

I have always been interested in investing but never knew where to start. My friend recommended meeting with Brett Sifling at Gerber Kawasaki. Brett helped me establish the right accounts including a ROTH IRA where I can now earn tax free money at retirement. The entire process has been much easier than I thought possible. Brett and the Gerber Kawasaki’s client services team is as good as it gets.<//Review>

I had a great experience at Gerber and Kawasaki. I would definitely recommend them. My financial advisor, Brett Sifling, took the time to sit with me and create a financial plan. I was surprised to see how affordable saving can be. The best part was I didn't need a lot of money to start an account. I feel confident now that I am on track with my money. Looking forward to the future! Thanks Brett!!!< /Review>

I’ve just invested into GK with a very helpful person names Brett Siftling. He explained all that’s good with stocks and long time stock investment opportunities. He than personally started a retirement fund that will soon be pulling out $250 a month from my current account and investing it so I can retire easy after I’m done working. This came in extremely handy do to the fact the my career does not offer 401K. Honestly, I think investment is a much smarter choice than 401K. He will jumble numbers all around until it’s easy for you to make your payments. Thank you Brett👍🏽<//text>

I was introduced to Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management by my Financial Advisor Robert Castillo. I have been a client of Robert for over three years and I am incredibly satisfied with Robert's services. He has helped me open retirement savings and make investments. Robert has been very supportive and helpful with my financial planning, helping make my future plans come to fruition. Before Robert, I had very little education on this matter, but Robert was very knowledgable and helped me realize that it was possible to save now and ensure that I had money invested into my future. I can not say enough great things about Robert. I highly recommend you contact Robert and get started now!<//review>

I was referred to Ben Dunbar by a friend I went to college with. I had no experience with investing, or even saving money responsibly, but Ben made the transition seamless. His devotion to client satisfaction is unwavering, and he is always available to answer any question I have -- even when I call him from a bar on the other side of the world. In truth, I was terrified at first to sign over a portion of my income to an investment firm, but Ben has made the experience not only comfortable, but fun. Now I enjoy signing into my account regularly just to watch my money grow!<//Review>

I had a great experience over the phone with G&K! I felt like I didn’t have any knowledge on investments or what my money could do for me before I spoke with Brett Sifiling. He is the best! Not only did he give me the tools I need to be even more successful but he also broke down every aspect of investing so that I could understand it at an elementary level. With Brett’s help I now feel more confident to do more with my money and also to expand my horizons for my future.<//Review>

They set up our financial plan and helped us invest. We felt really comfortable working with them as CEO Ross Gerber is great. Love watching him on CNBC and CNN. So great to have the most knowledgeable and experienced advisers helping our family. thanks.< /Text>< pictures>

I’ve been a client of GK for 8 years now. My financial advisor, Francine Lai, has been fantastic. When I began with her, I was fresh out of graduate school and in need of sound financial advice. Now she works with my husband and I to plan for our future and our children’s future. She will sit down with you and have a one on one consultation to figure out the best solution for you and your family's needs and the best approach.

We are so grateful to have Francine as our financial advisor and highly recommend her services.</text>

<review>I have nothing but great things about Gerber Kawasaki. My advisor Brett Sifling truly changed my life for the better. I've been following Brett on twitter for years and years (@BsiflingTrades).. The kid is smart as heck. He sat down with me and took a comprehensive overview of my entire financial situation before making my perfect recommendation. He has been a great resource for my financial life and there is no reason you shouldn't work with him. Keep up the good work Brett!!< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

If you are thinking about working with Gerber Kawasaki, please ask for Michael Baker.  I was new to the whole investing thing and I have been working with my advisor, Michael Baker, for a couple months now and I know that he has my best interest in mind.  He was very helpful in explaining an investing plan that would best work with my budget and I feel confident in my investments.  If you want an investor who is easy to reach and has your best interests, I highly recommend Gerber Kawasaki and Michael Baker for your financial needs.< /Review>

I've been self employed for 32 years. I met with Zach Bainter to ask what would I have to save/invest to be able to keep my standard of living in Santa Barbara, and retire in 10 years. Zach put together a plan for me. And I'm on track, actually ahead of the track, for my goal. Zach is knowledgeable. I appreciate his being able to explain my investments in simple terms. Always accessible, and quick to answer any questions or concerns I have. I appreciate that he checks in with me when he hasn't heard from me in a while.  I've recommended Zach to my friends. I am completely confident, and rest assured, knowing Zach is my investment/savings representative.< /Review>

I just started working with a financial advisor at this firm. His name is Ziad Hijazi and I fully recommend working with him. I am a college student who has been working/saving money since I was 18, but I had no idea about wealth management. I'm 21 now and decided that it was time to take saving and investing more seriously. I previously had 0 knowledge about any investing/wealth building, but Ziad has helped me learn so much and has made the transition to wealth building seamless. He is always a phone call or an email away and is ready to answer any of my questions. I was scared at first to invest a good amount of my life savings, but Ziad has gained my full trust and he does a great job of helping my money grow. Definitely recommend working with him!</Review>

As a young adult I came to realize that it is extremely important to invest in stocks/bonds and my retirement to better my future. I made an appointment with Brett at Gerber Kawasaki to broaden my knowledge in savings and how everything works. Brett was patient and answered all my questions with his advanced knowledge and taught me so much about savings. I had no problem starting an account through Brett and I would recommend anybody I know to start an account with Gerber Kawasaki.< /review>

Having worked in accounting and finance my whole career, I've sought out minimal financial guidance over the years.  Now, with 2 kids in college, a recent change in my employment and retirement approaching in the relatively near future, I decided it was time to really take a hard look at my savings and retirement plans.  I feel Brett Sifling and Gerber Kawasaki have tremendous vision and strategy for both my long term and short term financial goals.  Brett has proven to be honest, patient and thorough.  He is a pleasure to work with and makes me feel confident that my investments are in good hands!<//Text>

I have been working with Francine for the past year. She has been so helpful in helping my wife and me save and invest money and most recently start a college education fund for my son. It feel so wonderful to have financial security and to have someone encourage and support us along the way. We would be lost without her and I can't recommend Francine enough if you're looking to set yourself up in the future.<//Text>

Francine Lai has been my financial advisor for about 8 years now and I have referred many of my personal family and friends to her. She helped me put together a financial plan that I have seen grow tremendously over the years. She is very responsive and tentative, always following up with her clients to make sure that they feel secure about their financial decisions and their growing portfolio. I highly recommend her for anyone looking for a trustworthy and knowledgeable financial advisor!</text>

I'm so happy that I started working with Ben Dunbar.  He helped me with my investments, 401k, IRA, life insurance, and just general financial planning and budgeting .  He also linked in my husbands account after we got married which was a seamless process.  Ben is very enthusiastic about his work and we feel so well taken care of.</Text>

< Review>
I have been working with Gerber Kawasaki wealth management since 2013. Zach Bainter is my advisor and he has constantly exceeded my expectations. Zach is a great communicator, a fast responder and always willing to explain anything I have questions on or about. I’ve been very happy with my ROI and subsequently referred many family members and friends to him. Zach always goes above and beyond and I’m grateful for his services.< /Review>

Being fairly new to financial investments and savings, I was naturally nervous when it came to buckling down and finding a financial adviser.  My financial adviser is Francine Lai and I could not have imagined a better experience.  She is not only warm and personable, but truly listens to my concerns and tailors solutions to fit my needs and lifestyle.  She is truly knowledgeable about the field and makes me feel like I am her only client.  Highly recommend!< /text>

<text>Francine Lai is very knowledgeable and very patient. She considers all of my financial aspects and gives me the best recommendation. She’s not pushy and allows me to sit on my decision. She is supported by a superb team and I’m totally satisfied. Thank you Francine!</text>< response>

I have been with Gerber Kawasaki for a couple of months now and have nothing but great things to say about them. Before coming to GK I have been doing all of my investments myself, but it is by far more than a full time job. With the help of my advisor Michael Baker, I do not have to worry about my finances and I know that my money/future is safe with them. He has also been my good friend for about 15 years now and knows how I am about my finances, so it shows how much trust I have in Gerber Kawasaki and Michael! I look forward to a long relationship with this company!</review>

He helped us set up  retirement plans and has made us a sizable amount of money through the years. He always has his clients best interest in mind and does what it takes to individualize their needs.

This is a fantastic wealth management firm. Matt Iantosca takes the time and effort to explain all aspects of investing. He helped me with my Corporate 401k, retirement funds, short-term investing accounts, and my life Insurance policy. Also, the pricing for management is exceptional. I have sent my sister, my brother, and all my friends to Gerber Kawasaki for all their Financial needs.

Thank you!!!!< /Review>

<Review>I've worked with Gerber Kawasaki for over 10 years. I can not say enough good things about these guys. Starting out as a young professional I was clueless about what to do with my money.

I have recommended them to all of my friends and they all have nothing but the same great experience as i have.<//Review>< pictures>

<text>After college I found myself under a mountain of debt and my finances were out of control. I realized I was only getting deeper in to debt. Michael Baker sat down with me and set me up with an extensive financial plan. Although I am not completely debt free, yet*, I am much better off than I was this time last year. Michael provided me with great service and insight and I would definitely recommend him, as well as Gerber Kawasaki to anyone trying to get on a good path.<//text>< username>

<Review>Well, this investment went south, FAST.  I was looking for help building my financial plan and decided to Gerber Kawasak.

<Review>My experience with Gerber Kawasaki has been a great one. I have worked with Zach Bainter on business planning for a startup I began a couple of years ago. He is always available to answer questions; guide me and make suggestions I never would have otherwise considered. It is nice the level of personal attention they give to their clients big or small. I highly recommend them.<//Review>< pics>

I could not be happier with my experience at Gerber Kawasaki. Madison is a very knowledgeable advisor who offered me unbiased advice, and really taught me a lot about my personal finances. If you are looking to start investing, or you are unhappy with your current advisor, I would definitely give Madison and the people at GK a call.< /Text>

<Text>As a new business owner in Los Angeles I got into savings and retirement funds for myself and my future. I made an appointment with Brett Sifling at Gerber Kawasaki to broaden my knowledge and perspective on stocks/bonds and savings and I walked away from this meeting with more knowledge and experience than I ever thought I would. I made an account with Brett, and would highly recommend anybody to make an account through Brett with this company!</Text><user>115453515489829091968< /user><pictures>None< /pictures><user_name>Allie Menes</user_name>< GmapID>

Ben is a pleasure to work with. He is down to earth and doesn't mind explaining things in depth to a novice investor like myself. Although I don't have a lot of money to contribute, I sense that I am treated the same way as a wealthy investor.Looking forward to sicking with GK for the long haul.</Review>

My wife and I had never had any experience with financial planning, and we were pleasantly surprised of how knowledgeable our Adviser Brett Sifling was.  He made us feel at ease and really helped us understand exactly what each account is for and what to expect.  If you're new to investing or just want a company that gives you a personal feel, check out Gerber Kawasaki and ask for Brett Sifling, he's the best!</text>

< review>
Let's be real. When the market went to hell after the subprime nuclear bomb in 07/08 and the following recession, I think many people naturally became a bit cynical about the financial services industry. I for one certainly did, and in the past when I've received inquiries from firms looking to manage my money, I felt they were just looking to maximize their fees without actually taking care of my future. Then Brett Sifling (Investment Advisor at Gerber Kawasaki and one of Business Insider's "Top 20 Under 20" in Finance) came knocking at my door. Brett and the firm were very personable and honest in doing my consultation to let me know where I stand now and how they could help me maximize my earning potential into the future. Brett really impressed me because of how much he has accomplished and his wealth of knowledge about the markets at such a young age; so much so that I decided to open up an investment account with him, and I have no doubt he will guide me through this dark tunnel of uncertain times to reach above average returns. Thank you Brett and Gerber Kawasaki for putting my financial well-being first!<//review>

I have been working with Ben Dunbar at GK for over a year now. As a first time investor, Ben has taken the time to walk me through the process- every step of the way. GK's customer service has been great and Ben is always there for a call, an email, a visit, etc. Would highly recommend GK.</Text>

<review>If you are considering investing at all, I highly recommend that you give Brett Sifling at Gerber Kawaski a call. With so many investment opportunities, I wasn't sure where to invest my savings. Brett sat down with me and took a comprehensive look at my finances, and was able to build an investment plan specifically for me. Through Brett's advice, I was able to set up a retirement plan, actively invest in mutual funds, and put my money to work for me. Brett has been excellent from day 1, and through his advice and planning I am on the right track to achieve my future financial goals. I highly recommend Brett to anyone looking to invest, because Brett provides expert knowledge of investing, as well as the personal touch to creatively build investment plans specifically for you. If you want to the best advice and investment management, contact Brett Sifling at Gerber Kawasaki.</review>< pictures>

Madison and Gerber Kawasaki have provided nothing but the most professional investment advice. Don't believe the fake reviews, this place is as legit as it gets for handling your money. They are super transparent with their fees and what you are buying with that money. For me it was a no brainer, I have gotten such great value from working with GK.< /review>

It’s really hard to have someone else manage your money, so when my husband and I interviewed different financial advisors it was a difficult choice. We met with Francine Lai several times before we committed and ten years later, we are so happy and thankful that we chose her.  Francine is very meticulous with everything she does and truly cares about taking care of us through life’s transitions as we look ahead toward retirement (hopefully soon with her help).  There are many advisors out there, and I suggest you do your homework and work with someone that will look out for you. Francine has been that person for us and I have recommended her to family and friends and have only heard excellent reviews!</Review>

Me and my wife just recently decided it was time to set up a retirement account along with a savings for a home. Brett stifling was a great help he answered all the questions we had and even explained them in terms we could understand. We couldn’t be happier with our investments and are definitely going to get our friends and family on board with this firm.<//text>

<review>i've been working with Francine Lai for 4 years now and she really changed my outlook on my financial future. She really gave me hope by helping me come up with a game plan to secure my future retirement. She really clearly explained to me what needed to be done to reach my financial goals. I always felt like behind the game when it came to saving especially for retirement as none of my companies offered 401k's. Now not only do I have money tucked away, it's constantly growing which is the best part! She's always available to discuss any future plans that may affect my financial contribution to my retirement and savings. It's a really good feeling to have someone on your side who's an expert!< /review>< pictures>

<review>I have worked with Gerber Kawasaki for over a year now.  Ayal Shmilovich, my advisor, is great.  He helped me build my financial plan and helped me invest my money and got it to grow for me. I had no investment experience before and no knowledge of financial planning and I am super excited that Ayal and GK helped me do it.  I highly recommend them to anyone who needs help with their money.<//review>< name>

Building your weath and retirement has to be a number 1 priority and in the hands of the best out there.  GK investment firm is top quality. My financial advisor Brett Sifling is incredible and taking my weath to a whole new level.

<review>My adviser is Brett Sifling, I was surprised by how much he taught me, took the time to teach, and answered any of my questions. Very helpful and most important to me was NOT PUSHY on trying to get me to sign up for anything, in fact recommended how to better control and take care of some of my debt before even setting up an account. I went ahead and set up an account and did a low monthly contribution unitll i pay off a credit card then will put in half my CC payment into my account. Aprecciate the honesty and helpfullness. Hard to find these days. highly recommend!<//review>< UserId.>

<text>I've dropped off my car twice with Pat here at Morales Automotive and it's always been a great experience! I've found my new go to shop for all my automotive needs.

I initially took my car to the dealer and they were charging almost $5,000 to fix my oil housing unit along with some other minor repairs. I took the estimate to Pat and he ended up doing all the work the dealer had suggested for less than $1600!! I couldn't believe the huge difference!

I ended up driving my car to Texas and back-no problems whatsoever.

<Review>Best, most dependable, most honest folks who have ever done automotive work on any of my vehicles.
I currently live in northern California, 87 miles north west of Redding, California.
I am more than willing to drive 647 miles just to bring my truck into the Morales shop for work to be done.
Not only excellent craftsmanship, but OUTSTANDING PEOPLE.< /Review>< pictures>

<Review>If you want an honest mechanic and not sure where to go this is the place . Service was great , I didn't feel pressured into doing something I didn't want to as most mechanics do. Didn't seem like they where trying to milk us for more than what we needed. I am definitely coming back here for future service .
Thank you guys !

Matt who was such an honest intelligent mechanic had it fix the same day.  It's hard to find decent and honest shops and mechanics know in days. 01/15/19 Just came back to get my other Infiniti  fx worked on, had the check engine light on they fixed it.

I have an older car and go to a local state college.  I don't have a lot of money or time so I was very pleased to know my friend Mark highly recommended this place to take my Scion.  The service came in under my estimate and my car was returned at the promised date.  Thank you Alma for all your help I really do appreciate your family business and service techs.< /text>

VERY HONEST BUSINESS HERE.  I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF MONEY AND JUST NEEDED TO REPAIR MY CAR JUST ENOUGH TO KEEP IT RUNNING SAFELY.

Took my car in got it checked right away, told me what it was.  Since it was a bit late already took it in the next morning and assist me right away and had my car ready before i went to work. Very pleased with their customer service. Will definitely recommend this auto repair to anyone. Oh and my sister asked me about them and she said she will tell my dad too since he also has a bmw and haven't found a trust worthy place to take it.< /Review>< pics>

I will say semi semi, tried to get info while trying to get my car there but seem like attendant wasn't really feeling it, first no one picked up the phone from constant calls and then rushed you off the phone, when asked did you hang up on me his remark was yea probably . But besides that the place seem to actually work after being delayed and pushed back another 2-3hrs until completion....they still hardly ever pick up phone<//Review>

I'd give five stars but this place was not  how it was in the past, the store doesn't offer fashion styles, at least, when I was here.
I wished because I'm a mature fresh woman with a young look but I wasn't able to find something that for my look at this time.
I got underwears but regarding bras the store doesn't carry lace bras since I don't wear sponge or push-ups bras, I believe I'm left out because not all women like sponge or push-ups bras styles.</review>

Went for dinner after roughing it out in Safari West.
Was fortunate enough to land an 830pm reservation through Open Table in one shot. Score! Kobe! Apparently, they had a cancellation which worked to our benefit.
Parking was easy.
Terra is a one star Michelin fine dining establishment.  And we walked in wearing our safari outfit and converse shoes. We fit right in. Lol.
The staff in Terra are very accommodating, welcoming, and attentive. Our server always had a smile on his face whenever he addressed us.
The menu is divided into two sections -- savories and sweets. You have an option to create a four, five, or six course meal from the given selection. If you want to skip dessert, you could choose to have all savory dishes.  I didn't ask if I could have all desserts though.  Just a thought. The portions aren't minuscule either.  Gf and I opted for the 5-course tasting menu. So between us we were able to try 8 savory dishes and 2 desserts. This is a pro tip:  If you have this option, choose different items on the menu so you could try almost everything.  That is, if who you're with is willing to share.  They also had a special supplemental winter truffle menu that night.
Their food was scrumptious!  The entire meal was unbelievable!
There were obviously dishes that stood out -- chawanmushi with lobster and shrimp; sautéed foie gras, sweet corn soup, and truffle; lobster tortelloni, sauce américaine, shimeji mushrooms, and spinach; and, of course, their signature dish, the sake marinated black cod and shrimp dumpling, with shiso broth.
Their wine list, although California heavy (but of course we're in Napa), offers a lot of good choices at reasonable prices. Per our sommelier's recommendation, we selected the 2011 Gallica Grenache. It was a great choice.  So much so that I ended up buying 2 bottles to take home with us.
It was definitely a Terra-fic (sorry can't help it) dining experience!< /Review>

The atmosphere is subdued with a quiet, intimate setting; there are only a few tables, and reservations required. It is a delicious place for a date or romantic celebration.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

My wife and I each had 3 savory courses. Sadly, we enjoyed 2 of the 6. Each dish was expertly prepared. However, the flavor profile of each dish was overly assertive and ultimately unappetizing. We were so excited to try Terra, but will likely not return.</Review><UserId.>104351882027374578316</UserId.><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

A fresh and memorable California take on Japanese cuisine. The sake marinated black cod lives up to its reputation -- super tasty. Then again, we didn't have any dish we didn't like. If you like seafood, then this is a must try place on your Napa trip.< /review>

< Review>
Xolo is nearly always a delight. Super fast, delicious, quality Mexican food, either delivery or on-site. One downside of success--they're making their crispy tacos ahead of time, and they don't always completely thaw during frying.</Review>

Lied about menue price . Took  15 minutes to drive there and had a order from 7 people just to find out they charge extra for everything u order and don't honor their price online. Even have a delivery service that has same prices but wouldn't honor it . Asked for owner and manager and lady said to bad cause they aren't there and won't be until tomorrow.  Rude service and fake prices.  Highly don't recommend</Review>

<review>I always come to Xolo for lunch. I love the side salad and cheese quesadillas. The food is fresh, delicious, and full of flavor. I’ve never tried the tacos but I’ve heard they are magical. Don’t look at the negative reviews without looking at the positive reviews. Xolo is a great restaurant with a lot of heart and soul.<//review>< GmapID>

Some of you may not be aware of all the time and effort I've been putting into my research. I've scoured the internet, driven all over the East Bay, and talk to many people. I think I found it. The best breakfast burrito in the East Bay. I will be continuing my research to confirm my findings.<//Text>

Both had so much meat on them they were a bit tricky to pick up, but nice thick double corn tortillas held them together nicely.   Great place for a quick cheap bite before a show at the Fox< /text>< Pictures>

<review>I have been to Xolo a few times, they have a really good menu and plenty of options if you are coming with a friend who may have different eating preferences.  My only thing is the burritos are not as big as I would like them to be, and they do not have a salsa bar and charge extra for salsa on the side with your food. Other than that I would give this place a five star review, because I love the decorations of the place and they have really high ceilings and have seating upstairs and outdoor seating.<//review>< userid>

This was for a take-out of guacamole and chips and two crispy beef tacos and they were delish and fast! I was hungry and it came out so quickly and it was tasty! I needed a quick fix as I was going to a show a few doors down and I knew this place opened until 10 pm on a Tuesday night so I entered, ordered and was out of there within 5-10 minutes!<//Review>

The tacos were delicious, and ready and brought to the table so unbelievably quickly! I tried the beef and the chicken tacos. They just melted in the mouth. They were loaded up with meat and onions and cilantro. Other people were happy Witt their tacos, including shrimp. The menu isn’t huge, but it offered a good selection of burritos and tacos, with a good selection of beverages. There’s plenty of seating. The bathroom was clean, which is always a good sign for the place overall. The staff were friendly. The place was busy pretty late on  a weekday, but not too loud to have a conversation. I’d want to try more before giving it five stars, but I’m definitely open to the possibility. They also have a big bike rack out front, so bonus points for that! It’s close to BART.< /review>

Very cool taqueria tucked away in a shop front. Its a la carte menu is pretty extensive but everything we had was delicious! The only thing that sucks is finding seating, which there is plenty of but someone has to then find your table to being the food. As well if you need another drink you have to get back in line. The atmosphere is totally worth it though, especially where we sat in the back outside.<//review>

<review>I went back a two days after my first visit...great tacos!! The prices are fantastic and the tacos are stuffed.

My order was quick coming out and the staff were friendly and helpful. Good vegan & gf options (hongos tacos!).

Sitting upstairs offers a great view of Telegraph, but if it's a hot day be prepared to be a little hotter up there. The back patio seating is chill and a great place to sit and talk.

Definitely recommend!<//review></record></dataset><record>

I recently moved back to California and one of the biggest things I was excited about is finding my new taco spot. Well, Xolo is the place. I probably come here once a week and I don’t even live in Oakland anymore. The crispy beef tacos are the best and make sure you get the spicy red salsa!</Review>

Tacos are great! I love the little patio in the back. They offer beyond meat- the vegetarian alternative to ground beef. And their vegetarian burrito is one of the best I've ever had.  Perfectly saucy, copious veggies great beans, and lots of avocado.</Text>

<Review>I stopped by on a recommendation for some post-climbing-session food and was not disappointed. I had the surf-n-turf burrito and it was pretty killer. Also, the service was insanely fast. I'm not sure I was seated more than 2 minutes before my food was on the table. Going back here for sure.< /Review>< Pics>

<Review>Or at least it feels like it does. It's chicken soup with grilled chicken, tortilla strips, a little bit of heat and a lot of lime, and even with a cold you can taste it, and feel it working. My friend got the Danger Dog, a bacon-wrapped hot dog in a flour tortilla with all the fixings and she was loving it. The brownie was moist and big enough to split (full disclosure -- I couldn't taste it because of my cold, but my friend said it was delish). Ordering at the counter is quick and the food comes out fast and delicious, so don't mind the line, you'll get to where you're going in time. It's one of the cheaper alternatives before a concert at the Fox or the Paramount. There's table seating on the main floor, upstairs, and a small patio outside in the back. A large-screen tv downstairs shows mostly local sports or soccer.< /Review>< Pics>

<Review>Xolo is one of those larger holes in the wall that you could walk past and not think twice about it. You'd regret doing that though once your friend tells you how solid it is. There's nothing like finishing up a concert at the Fox, or seeing a show at the Paramount and finishing up the evening with a burrito, Corona , and guac from Xolo. If you're taking a date here there is this adorable little space in the back that is outside and overflowing with plants. You could miss it if you didn't know about it - but it's the type of experience that would leave your date thinking, wow, this person has good taste and is practical.< /Review>< UserId.>

The tacos are a tasty spin on authentic Mexican food. It's a, take a number and find your own seat, kind of place, and it is usually very busy so keep that in mind. I usually take my food to go. Love this place!<//Text>

Decent tacos. Friendly, clean and open room. Clean bathrooms and friendly staff.

My main complaint is that a lot of time the meat in the tacos is dry and tastes like it has sat in the warmer way too long.

Still, I come here a fair bit and don't mind it at all.< /Text>

It was a hot day and either the air conditioning is non existent or wasn't keeping up.  It was hot in the restaurant.  The ambiance was great.  It's eclectic and funky.  The layout of the restaurant makes me wonder if they just kept expanding in to adjacent businesses as they grew.

The food was good.  The only knock I would give is that it took a while for us to get our food.<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

OVERPRICED tacos in a beautiful, upbeat space. Horchata was good. Had shrimp tacos, not really worth it. Chicken tacos was far better! A good one time spot. I rather support the taco truck down the street. GOOD first date place, if youre bougie.</text>

Delicious vampiros - little $$$ for what it is. Also trouble with consistency, my vampiros don't always get to me as the same as my previous visit. For example, less meat, dry tortillas, little to no cheese</Text>

One of my favorite taco places! Fun spins on traditional classics. They also have pozole on special days, and delightful agua fresca 😋</Review>

<text>Ordered the steak burrito. *sighs* well..... I ordered what was supposed to be a steak burrito got home only to be completely Disappointed!

1. My 3 year old son foot is  bigger (length & width )than my burrito

2..my  Burrito look like it was dipped in grease after being wrapped. I can fry chicken in my stomach with all the grease that I’d bitten out of my burrito.

3. Can anyone help me find the meat that was supposed to be in my burrito ? My ✌🏽Steak✌🏽
(<— air quotes) was 98% beans!! Every bite
( the 4 that I had taken) made me gag because there was sooooo much beans. After the third scoop they should’ve put the spoon down.

4. I had enough white( not red 😒) onions in my ✌🏽Steak✌🏽 Burrito I could sell them to the while foods down the street.

5. THEY CHARGED FOR SALSA... FOR SALSA!!! ( yes I am screaming)

They do use quality ingredients....I can’t say that. However, if you’re lucky enough to actually get a decent size burrito without the mountain and 5 gallons of beans  and maybe some meat then your food will be good.

This is totally a hipster spot! I am born and raised in Oakland I know good Mexican food when I get it .

I will continue to support the Taqueria’s that are in the hood and surrounding area, there’s one on first Street a Taco Truck that’s really good I would definitely stay going on there!

Oh yeah! Before I forget their burritos are way overpriced to get what I got $10 for a burrito< /text>< pictures>

Great space and pretty good food. I come here every once in a while to get my fix for tasty, heavy Mexican food and mega crispy chips. The space is themed in a modern take on Mexico, with bright colors, metal surfaces and nice illustrative elements. The burritos are very filling but don’t quite knock it out of the park for me.</review>

<Review>The surf and turf burrito was a fail, unless 1 piece of shrimp constitutes as “surf”. Minus the lack of surf, it was meh. Mostly beans. The ambiance is very, very casual... like inner city high school cafeteria that hasn’t been cleaned for a minute, type of casual. The staff is nice enough. The best thing in the joint is the huge TV always on soccer. Honestly, we should’ve gone to Chipotle.<//Review>< pics>

Incredible food choices. This place bucks the trend for Mexican restaurants. Innovative options such as the Impossible tacos and chile rolleno burritos make this place a must go. It also helps that it's open later in the evening when such fares become exponentially more desirable.</Review>

<Text>Great Al Pastor tacos.  The shrimp tacos were just okay and very tiny, so probably skip those if you're hungry.  Nice place to stop for a quick bite before going to a show at The Fox.  I'll have to return to try their burritos.</Text>< pics>

<review>After I moved away, this was the restaurant I missed most in Oakland, and when I came back to visit, I couldn't skip it.  Still holds up, these burritos are muy muy delicioso! Festive and colorful inside, but if you want to be real cool, check out the hidden patio in back.<//review>< rate>

Food is good, if you ever get it. Restaurant sent me the wrong food on delivery then apparently decided to stop taking delivery orders meaning they were some how off the hook for correcting their errors. So I got stuck with some one else's order and no help. Lousy way to treat a customer.< /review>

Vegetarians amd meat eaters must must come here. I hate telling people about this place because it would get to popular, but seems the word is getting out.  We order the impossible tacos which are vegetarian but taste damn good and as authentic as you will get.  They also have awesome rice and refried beans are amazing. A must eat.< /Text>

< Review>
One of my favorite places to meet people for food and drinks in Uptown Oakland. Great space, plenty of room, and the back courtyard is great to hang when the weather is nice. It is pricey, especially the tacos, but they're delicious and unique. I love the Vampiro tacos.<//Review>

Went with my wife. Enjoyed some very nice Horchata while devouring 3 tacos each. They were a tad greasy because this place loves melted cheese. They are also small, as others have mentioned. However, they are much wider than most, and I still found myself full.

Their cabbage + lime + cilantro topping is superb, and a dash of their table-top hot sauce topped it off.

Overall, it was very nice. The atmosphere was nice and quiet on a Saturday night. The staff was very friendly and helpful. It felt very clean as well.< /review>

< Review>
Xolo is really stepping up their vegan options. First they had Impossible Burger meat, now they use Beyond Meat for tacos, burritos and more.  Also I think their pozole is vegan. Another excellent vegan option is the Hongos or mushroom filling which they will put in a taco or burrito and maybe some other things. All of their vegan options are tasty. So, although most of the menu consists of cruelly extracted meat items (individuals that want to live as badly as we do), Xolo does a great job of moving in the right direction!< /Review>

Upside: the sweet potato burrito is top-notch. Downside: no leftovers. Burritos here are actually the right size for a meal (rather than 1.5x which is the norm these days).< /Review>

My almost $12 Burrito was full of mostly rice with hardly no meet and no shrimp. Im NOT exaggerating. I ordered the surf and terf. Where was the meet?? And very small.

Way overpriced!

Also had tacos. Smallest tacos Ive ever seen. Lol. And again, not much on it for the expensive price.<//Text>

<text>Xolo is an okay place for a quick bite near the Fox before or after a concert. Their food is a bit pricey but decent. I like the Vampiro tacos and steak/shrimp burrito. These aren't Mission Burritos, so don't expect a lot. The Alfred Hitchcock poster is cool though.< /text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

Do get the mussels, which are called Le mules (I was so confused at first as I do not eat at French restaurants often). I got the provencale Le mules, which is apparently the French version. I also wanted to try to Thai marinated version. The mussels came in a pot, they were very well marinated, make sure to soak some in the soup before eating it. The mussels are naturally small so you can't really get full on them, that's why the menu suggests you get a side of fries.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

<text>It's a nice place. Very nice host. Clean too! But hard to find parking at night. Biggest turn off is I paid $10 for what I was told was a super burrito, it turned out to be the size of the grilled stuffed burrito at taco bell down the street that I was too impatient to wait in the long line for. Now the food was ok-good not worth $10 for that small of a burrito. Waste of my money<//text>< Resp>

The Big Ranch burrito is fantastic. If you are feeling tacos, the camarones taco has a killer sauce on it, and fried shrimp is pretty great too of course. A little pricy but not outrageous for the area.</text>

<review>Bland & Bourgsie. Overpriced and watered down for the untrained palete. First and last visit, fortunately my boss paid. Should have known by the menu only generically listing beef, pork and chicken. If you walk into a "Taqueria" and they list the meats on the menu that way, turn around and walk out.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x808f80b274a0f49b:0x1e1821f195ca9615< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I got the NOPALES burrito and it was AMAZING! it had a spicy pumpkin seed based sauce and eggs and potatoes and delicious black refried beans and so much deliciousness. I thought it had chorizo but I was wrong and frankly, I didn't miss it at all. Would definitely order it again and recommend everyone try it at least once because it clearly has some very Mexican flavors that you don't usually get at burrito places.

Edit: I went back! It was in the afternoon so they didn't have the burrito anymore as it's only for breakfast. I'm hooked on the nopales so I got a tostada with them and also their "Lima soup" which is a super deliciously tangy limey chicken tortilla strip soup. The chicken in the soup was a little overcooked but the broth was so good I didn't mind, that broth is the broth of my dreams. The other thing could be fixed is that the chips were cold but OMG their guacamole was perfection! Highly recommend for their vegetarian/vegan options and for people who want to try some authentic Mexican cactus YUM<//text>

Xolo is my go-to place when I head to a show at the Fox. It's across the street, has delish food, is relatively inexpensive, and they are fast! My fave order consists of the Vampiro and Machaca tacos. The Vapiro taco is a cheesy corn tortilla filled with perfectly seasoned al pastor crisped to perfection. The Machaca taco is also a corn tortilla but it is stuffed with tender, juicy, slow cooked beef that is shredded and accompanied by soft, sweet bell peppers and onions. Definitely try this place out of you're into Mexican food.< /Text>

<text>Always delish!! Mushroom taco, beef taco and veggie taco are some of my faves. The salad is amazing, although they are inconsistent with amount of toppings. I give a 4 for that and also they've given my vegetarian husband meet accidentally a few times.<//text></record></dataset><record>

Very popular place</review>
</record></dataset><record>
<Review>I didn't take pictures of my burrito because I really didn't want it and wanted to leave but my vegan friend who wanted a burrito so bad was paying& was very hungry. Due to the fact that she is vegan she ordered what was rudely told to her as a "special" burrito ( She deconstructed their ingredients in a veggie burrito by just adding the certain ingrrdients she wanted) by requesting no cheese& certain veggies. That's when a second employee interjected and sternly said "we don't do that!!" He looked annoyed by her request. My friend said but I don't eat meat or cheese and that's why I want specific items on my burrito. On the nenu it does state " ask for vegan options". Howvever, he got a little louder and said But I'm trying to help you so whatever& he walked away. The young man taking her order in the meantime was rolling his eyes in his head. We were not allowed to take a paper menu, seat ourselves to decide what we wanted when we walked in. We were allowed to sit on benches at the entrance to decide, place order and pay before we were allowed to seat ourselves to eat. The burritos are pricey to me compared to the size you receive but they are tasty. The chips are too thick but the red salsa and guacamole is fresh and delicious. Metered parking is near by and hard to find a spot. They have no parking available for customers. Sorry to say, I won't be returning there when I'm in Oakland and wanting a burrito.cyst</Review>< gmapID>

For what I paid the burrito should have been 2x the size it was. Also the beer didn't taste fresh, I wonder if they know that bottled beer has a 24 day self life.

<Review>Coming in to Xolo I was expecting something very special. I must have caught them on a off night. Service wise Xolo was excellent and very welcoming. The video e of the restaurant was very chill around the mid range noise level wise. It's a good date night spot for sure. Xolo however fell short on the grub. The burrito was lacking some true pastor flavor. I ordered the big ranch burrito with chips and salsa. The chips were not fresh and a little on the hard to bite into side. Pick de gallo was straight up tomato onion and cilantro no flare. It could've used some salt, lime juice, and serrano or jalapeño. The salsa verde made me want to go into the kitchen and add more to it. It also lacked seasoning and heat. I'll come back but I won't be ordering or recommending the Big Ranch.<//Review>< Pics>

<Review>Paid $15.75 for a Steak Burrito and Horchata just for the burrito to be as than a Pepto Bismol bottle. Plus the Horchata was $4 for a 12 oz cup. Was very disappointed in what I paid for.< /Review>< pictures>

There aren't a ton of great Mexican food spots around here so Xolo is a good find however everything is way overpriced. They don't serve chips to your table and they want you to pay extra for any salsa for the burritos as well.<//review>< pics>

<Text>I don't understand how this place has such a high rating. I got the chili rellano burrito. It literally came to the table as I sat down. It looked like it had been microwaved. I cut into it and a pile of grease just came out onto my plate. I was very disappointed because I didn't eat it what I paid for.< /Text>< gmap_id>

This place sucks. Burritos are $10 and up! Theyre filled with mostly beans and barely any meat! Not to mention they charge for salsa! Its not even authentic. Its some white guy's idea of what mexican food taste like.. taco bell is more authentic and better than this failure of a mexican restaurant</Text>

Food is good but VERY overpriced: $7 for chips and maybe 2 oz. of guacamole, $4 for street tacos (need at least 3 to make a decent meal). Also, the chips are way too crunchy.< /review>

Tacos are delicious. I'm a fan of the beef and chile verde ones.The burritos are not the best. The surf-n-turf one sounds good, but it doesn't have much meat or shrimp. It is mostly beans. It advertises pinto beans, but they are actually refried. Really good guacamole and chips. It is counter service and they bring the food out to your table.<//text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>This is our go-to taqueria.  Great burritos, tacos, and a hearty giant salad which we'll get and add chicken or camarones to.

Aguas frescas are always available, and the recently-added fried plantains dessert item is delicious.<//Text>< pictures>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) The taste is good, but the attention is very bad
especially on the part of the lady who is taking the orders, is always bad and apparently they give them the onion because it is more onion than food .....

(Original)
El sabor esta bueno, pero la atencion es pesima
sobre todo por parte de la senorita que esta tomando las ordenes, siempre esta de malas y al parecer les regalan la cebolla por que es mas cebolla que comida.....<//Review>
