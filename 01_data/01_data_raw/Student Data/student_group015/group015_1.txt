To begin with just like Eddie Serrato, this company has no ethics when working on your home. We had a pipe leak in March in the Masterbath.  They started work in April and still are not complete.  We have been out of our home for 4 months. The bathroom has not been done and all other work flooring was put together by subpar workers.  They project managers were a joke. They Darryl lied to my insurance adjuster and said they were completing my floor and had not started.  He sent unknown non employee to work on my floors.  The worker did not know Daryl or CA Construction. Yet he was in my home unattended.  Aaron the "Owner" refuse to call me over a 4 week period of request.  He responded when a check came in and needed our signatures. They did not complete my floor or the bathroom. They charged $300 of wood flooring to our card and have no account where it is.  Do not trust these people.  They send the White Man Appraiser out to sell the job to you for Aaron Avila the owner.  We never saw him till it was time to sign some checks. They did not order our bathroom until 3 months into the job and then it was backordered for 2 months.  So we are moving back end with no bathroom or AC.  They never covered non work areas and stained our living room carpet.  3 times they were given to do this job correct..each time they tried to patch it up.  DO NOT TRUST THEM....They knew were out of house and my wife was battling cancer and they took full advantage of it.  Now we go back without her bathtub or toilet.</review>

< Review>
CA Construction is fantastic. We have had so many poor experiences in the past that we were expecting glitches in work quality and the finished product. Little to our surprise this company uses their own workers who are of the highest quality craftsmanship!!!! Our home is stunning!  Thank you Joe, Arnoldo, Elvis, Ruben, Jose and Al.  All fantastic craftsmen! Their work is a reflection of their values. Honest beyond measure. Thank you gentlemen for everything!  We love the finished work you did!

It all began by speaking to a wonderful young lady named Danysa. Can’t get any better than that. Her polite professionalism and quick response to scheduling for Patrick to come out to survey what needed to be done is beyond words.

Patrick arrived at our home a few minutes early, yes I said early!  He quickly surveyed our needs and said he would get back to us with a bid. We received his bid the next day, approved the contract, a fair and reasonable amount surprise surprise!

Darreld was assigned as the project manager!  This young man is truly exceptional!  He is polite, respectful and of the highest professionalism!  Words can’t say enough about him. Thank you Darreld from the bottom of our hearts.

We contacted Aaron, Owner of CA Consutruction, to express our gratitude for the work done in our home. The finished product is of the highest quality!  Well we can see how this company has such high quality employees, Aaron sets the bar!  He was polite, professional and expressed him thanks for our calling him to let him know how pleased we
were with his craftsmen. Kudos Aaron!  You provide a honest, fair and high quality service!  You’ll be the one company we will not hesitate to call for our future needs!

I apologize to anyone reading this review as I know it is lengthy.  I feel you need to know the quality you’ll get from this company. Best quality and workmanship for the money you pay!

After a car crashed into my home and drove through my garage I hired CA Construction to do the repairs.  Darreld my project manager came out and took care of everything from there.  His crew came out 2 days later and started the repairs.  4 days later they where completed and fix all the framing and replace my garage door and motor.  I highly recommend them to everyone.</review>

CA construction did a excellent job with the repairs at my home and I would recommend them to anyone needing their services. The team of Davis Dylan and Darrell were outstanding.  They were very professional, always on time, and courteous.  It was nice to see that a company still we’re doing quality work and very professional. I appreciated seeing that because I thought it was no longer available. 5 stars.< /review>

<text>Great company. Unfortunately, I bought a condo just over a year ago and have had 2 instances of water damage from the upstairs restroom down into the first floor. I originally worked with a company that the plumber recommended and even though they were nice and professional, they refused to finish the work until the insurance company paid out more money. My insurance company said the money they already paid that company was supposed to cover all the work so instead of battling with that company, they referred me to a list of contractors they work with and CA Construction was one they highly recommended. They did such great, quick work the first time that this second time around I knew immediately I wanted to work with them again. And they did not disappoint! The work done looks beautiful, all the workers were friendly, and Daryl (project manager) was extremely helpful and patient with us. He was easy to reach and always answered back in a timely manner. I would definitely work with them again.< /text>< pics>

Our home was badly damaged in a storm. Due to the configuration and materials use in the original structure, a great deal of research had to be done before construction could begin.  The end result using hard to get materials and superior workmanship resulted in a very happy customer.< /review>

Very satisfied with the work that CA Construction performed at my home. They redid my entire floor from my living room and kitchen. Darreld was very professional and I could tell he is experienced  in this field. He had a great response and answer to my many questions. Great customer service skills.I will definitely continue to use this company for any future home projects.< /text>

<text>We had water damage due to a hot water pipe burst under slab in bathroom and into master bedroom. CA did the restoration and we are very pleased with the results. Workmenship was good quality and all issues we had during the construction were quickly remedied to our satisfaction by Jeff Bingham the project manager. My only issues was scheduling which took longer than the estimated projection on the contract but other than that I do recommend CA for restoration repairs.< /text>< pictures>

I don’t normally do this, but when you have an experience like the one I had with CA Construction it really makes you want to shout  about it from the mountaintops.  Maybe this will be as effective.  I recently had my roof catch fire. The damage was very bad.  From the basement to the roof I was dealing with flooded areas, electrical damage, and the fire had scorched everything from the ceiling to the roof.  I never thought It was going to be possible to repair the damage or that I could afford it.  After having several companies assess the damages I remembered overhearing a friend being told about the good work they had done by CA Construction.  Once I made that phone call it’s was like everything fell into place.  It was such a painless experience once I had started the process.  They helped me get with my insurance agent and worked out the numbers and devised a game plan.   To make a long story short the shop looks twice as good as it did before the fire and they did it in less than 3 months.  Every time that I made a surprise pop in visit there was about 3-5 workers doing something productive and giving me progress reports.  If you ever have a fire call CA Construction first, don’t bother waisting your time with those other companies</Review>

<text>I had the pleasure of working with Davis when my house flooded. He was very helpful, friendly, and professional with the whole process. He let me know how long the process would take right from the beginning and kept in touch with me. It's reassuring to know there are qualified employees in this type of industry.<//text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

My poor roof leaked all winter. CA Construction and Statefarm helped me navigate through not one, not two, but three separate leaks. Coming out everytime I called often the very next day. They were so helpful and understanding and made such a beautiful repair. It's like nothing happened!<//review>

My house flooded and I contacted CA Construction. Not knowing what to expect since this was the first time I've had this happen, I was contacted by Davis. He was very professional and informative of what the process would entail. He was able to answer all my questions and put me at ease that I was in good hands.  He assured me that his guys would do a great job. He was right! I was very happy with the end results. Davis was very knowledgeable and would even check in with me to make sure everything was going ok and kept me up to date as to what would be happening. Davis is an outstanding asset to your company. Thank you for having such an experienced employee who does his job amazingly!<//Text>

<Text>I had the opportunity to use CA Construction recently to do repairs to my house due to water damage. The repairs included wall repairs; complete kitchen remodel; new laminate flooring; tile; baseboards and painting with cost approximately $30,000. They did a fantastic job. As a professional engineer and project manager for over thirty years, I can say without hesitation that their Project Manager Mr Darreld Van Westrienen was a consummate professional who completed the work within scope; cost and schedule. He kept me in constant communication of the work progress and managed all change orders in such an efficient manner so as to eliminate scope creep. He ensured that the work was clean of all debris at the end of the job and was always pleasant throughout the job. He is a great ambassador for CA Construction and I wish him and CA Construction well on other jobs. I also want to mention their great office support in Lisa Quintana a seasoned professional who managed major construction projects exceeding $150M for public agencies I will highly recommend CA Construction to others.

I wish to express my profound thanks to your Project Manager Darreld for his professional courtesy and thorough work at my property.
He is thorough and very competent And a joy to work with.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

CA construction rebuilt our kitchen after a serious water leak in the Attic damaged our ceiling,  cabinets and electrical appliances.  Our construction Foreman Darreld kept us well informed and kept our project moving forward until it was completed.  Our custom cabinets electrical appliances and granite countertops were rebuilt or replaced, all of the paint ,finish carpentry and electrical was done above our expectations thanks to Darreld's oversight. We highly recommend CA construction</text>

I have been working as a supplier for CA Construction for 3 year and have done hundreds if not thousand of layouts and kitchen designs for there customers.  They are highly educated in the repairs and remodels that they perform.  They have trully pushed our design to be the best and I have seen them do beautiful custom modification to make there project complete master pieces.  I have had the opportunity to talk to there customers and I consistantly get the same feedback and that is how great the CA Constructon team is and how easy they have made the process.  On a personal note I have been able to meet with Darreld there lead project manager and Aaon there General manager and have seen they put there customers first and stand behind there words.<//Text>

<Review>Well this is gonna be a long one. I’m 80 days into the repairs. I was originally told it was 2-3 week job. No I didn’t believe that when I heard it, but I sure as hell didn’t expect 3 months, and it’s still not done. I had a flood and all they had to do is replace drywall and paint. They want me to pay extra to replace the outlet and light switch covers. The project manager was a joke and lied constantly.
I’ve been going back and fourth for like 20+ days just deciding how they want to compensate me....... more to follow

June 12, 2018 update...
7 days since my original post and they still haven't resolved anything for me. Actually they haven't even responded.
and to be clear its easily been since around April 20th'ish since any workers have been to my home.

Wow still no resolution 150 days........
It took them like a 3-4 days short of a month to respond or review a offer. I think I’ll take just as long if not longer to reply back since that seems to be an acceptable amount of time.<//Review>< user>

Seeing as this was the first time I had dealt with a major renovation, I was understandably a little nervous about the entire process. But I have to definitely give credit to CA Construction for walking me through the entire process and easing my fears when necessary. The office staff was always warm and professional and did their best to answer my questions in a timely manner. My project manager, Darreld V. , gave me helpful insight into making my property more desirable for buyers once it would be ready to put on the market. What I was even more appreciative of was how he worked within my budget to provide the touches and finishes that were beyond my original scope of repair. Given the fact that my property was a complete "gut job", his crew worked tirelessly to meet all my requests and went above and beyond to ensure that the finished product was one that I would be proud of owning. Despite the fact that I was unable to visit the site as often as I would like, they followed through with any changes or requests, which  is a testament to their professionalism and dedication to their craft. I cannot thank Darreld and his entire crew enough for the job that they done for me and my family.<//review>

So grateful to CA Construction! Recently our local bar suffered major fire damage, and was forced into temporary closure. Luckily, the owners chose a very professional and friendly company to repair the damage. They've allowed myself as well as other locals missing our favorite spot, to drop by and support the owners during this trial when appropriate. According to the owners, they've been extremely helpful in dealing with insurance, and informative about the remodeling process. Looking forward to seeing our favorite bar not just fixed, but better than ever! If my house caught on fire, I'd call CA construction first. Thank you all so much for your hard work and dedication!!!</Text>

What a great company for when the unexpected happens!  We had a water pipe in our upstairs bathroom blow, and flooded the whole house.  Davis was the best during this emergency, getting the pipe repaired and water removal, letting us know CA Construction would help us through the whole process of insurance claims, and all of the repairs.  Dylon worked with our insurance company after estimating all the repairs for the flooding and got everything approved and handled without any stress on my family. Brian and his crew were the best!!!  Extremely professional and quick.  We had one delay when the tile we were replacing in the bathroom was on backorder, but Brian showed us some other options and we found one that we've been wanting to do for awhile for the same price!  We're looking at remodeling out kitchen next year, and will definitely be calling CA Construction!<//review>

CA Construction did an amazing job on our kitchen remodel. We were referred to them by All State and their estimator Chris came out the next day(Friday). The other companies I called said they earliest they could come was Monday. Chris was extremely friendly and very knowledgeable. While going over the contract he explained the how from the start date how a project manager would be assigned to call then visit.

To my surprise Darreld called me the very next day. It's almost jaw dropping to see how this company actually keeps their word. Darreld showed me various selections for flooring and made sure to provide me with plenty of options.

From signing the contract to completing the job it took them about 8 business days to compelete! Two days ahead of schedule if I may add.

Thanks CA Construction and crew for your AMAZING service!< /Review>

<review>I called CA Construction Company when another company left me hanging. They responded immediately. Chris came to my home and prepared the estimate. Darreld was my project manager. He addressed all of my concerns in a timely manner and had the job completed in 1 1/2 weeks. Darreld always answered my calls and took care of everything. He went over and above. From Denisa in the office, to Martin, Leo and Guermo the work was excellent. They employ the best.</review>< pictures>

I was on a work trip and when I found out the unit above mine had caught on fire! The fire department came and had hosed down the upper unit but there was a ton of water damage to my home. I was in complete shock and could not believe this was happening to me. When my property manager had brought on CA Construction. Dylon met with me and went over how long the process would take, and ensured me I was in safe hands. He left me his card and said if I ever had questions or concerns, to call him ASAP.
After signing the contract the project manager Brian called me the very next day! They did the demolition and dry out in a week and a half, then completed reconstruction in two weeks! I have to say the condition of my home was way never and better then before and they ended up turning this nightmare into an dream. I would recommend CA Construction in a heart beat, they gave me quality service, speedy work, and were a pleasure to work with.<//Review>

One of the worst haircuts I ever got. Left side is longer than my right side and not straight in the back. Came here before and had a great haircut, it’s a but hit and miss depending who cuts the hair.<//Text>

<text>I have been going to Peter for my haircut for 4 years.  My entire family also get their hair cut here.  All the stylists have good skills and take their time to give high quality cut.  I just got mine done today after 5 months since shelter in place.  Same high quality service and my hair looks much healthier and better!  Peter is very skilled and knowledgeable on hair care.   Let us support local business and get pampered with a great hair cut!</text><gmapID>0x808fba57d1753905:0xb3bdd0874fc3aa19< /gmapID><user_name>Ye Ding< /user_name><response>None</response>< date>

Two stars because they're usually nice, and definitely cheap, but you also get what you pay for. They did this to my boyfriend's hair, and the sideburns were uneven too (not pictured). Don't go if you have expectations for your hair!< /review>

<Rating>3<//Rating><review>They are open during CoVID and are doing hair cuts outside. However I feel like they are a one trick pony. I have curly hair and asked for layers. They cut my hair in a bob with minimal layers so that "it won't get frizzy." It's the absolute worst haircut for my face and hair. I look like a 🌲.  I now have to wet my hair daily and put product in to tame it. It's probably a great place if you want a trim or have straight hair. Curly people avoid. But three stars for being open and doing an ok cut<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

It's been my place of choice since I moved to the Bay Area. They're courteous, warm and extremely capable. I don't know how their stylists are trained, but honestly each of them do such a fantastic job that I don't mind if my usual stylist is unavailable at times. The pricing is pretty normal for a salon of this size in Palo Alto<//review>

<Name>Private Reviews<//Name><time>1553796358842</time><rate>1</rate><text>I just had a men’s hair cut here. Jenny, the well dressed mid-aged women seems very skilled, so I asked her to cut my hair.

I don’t know, maybe it’s the way I dressed today or something, but things did not go well. She washed my hair, and scraped my neck with her nail—it was painful. Then she dried my hair but didn’t dry my ears. In fact she did not wrap tower around my neck so my collars got wet on the way back to her chair.

I asked to rinse my hair after the cut, but she rinsed it and then made many many adjustments. This left me picking very short hair out of my ear for minutes in the parking lot.

The cut itself was skillful but very underwhelming.

Also, I did not understand the other language she spoke to her coworkers. But to my ears the speech was kind of loud and harsh when she is cutting my hair right behind my ears.

For a experienced hair stylist, these seem unlikely to be mistakes.

So, hopefully you can meet the good side of Jenny like the positive reviewers experienced, but my hair cut here, as a new customer, was a very bad experience.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

I've been visiting the midtown hair studio for the last 6 or 7 years, and keep coming back!

They almost always have walk in availability, and seem to schedule staff around peak hours so the wait isn't long. I can always expect to sit with a familiar hairdresser, which is great because they remember what I like. Whenever I walk in I'm greeted like an old friend. The entire staff, particularly the owner Zim, are always very friendly and charming, and never fail to make you feel welcome.

The haircuts are great, and the prices are reasonable. I always leave satisfied and will keep coming back. Great neighborhood hair cut!</text>

Went here recently.
My barber (I didn't get her name) cut me lightly on the back of the neck with the electric razor.  When I tried to inspect the wound in the end with the back mirror she tried to cover it up with my hair, mumbling something about how my hair looks better down in the back. Very Unprofessional!
The hair cut wasn't too great either.<//review>

<review>Finding talented, kind and accommodating hair-dressers can be quite a a challenge.  I am so thankful I found Midtown Hair Studio and plan to frequent this business for as long as the doors stay open!

Peter, one of the hair-dressers at Midtown Hair Studio, has cut my hair every two weeks for the past 6 months.  Peter, as well as the rest of the staff I've interacted with, are dedicated to providing high-quality haircuts, always extremely polite, and prioritize customer schedules by finding available hair-dressers in short time frames to accommodate schedule requirements.

If Google allowed 10-star reviews I would surely give Midtown Hair Studio all 10.  If you're searching for a new hair-dresser give Midtown Hair Studio a shot - I'm confident you'll be impressed.<//review>< pictures>

<text>Jenny always does a fantastic job with my wavy hair and really listens to my preferences. I got a fine but boring haircut and she improved it so much with layers and making my hair lighter. I've referred a friends here (including one with very thick, curly hair who has trouble finding good places) and my toddler boy's hair cut here also and everyone has always had a wonderful experience. We love it!< /text><user_name>Sheena Madan<//user_name>< time>

Went there for a simple haircut, no style change, nothing complicated. In general it was really hard to communicate with the stylist. She went super fast and refused to see the photo I wanted to show her when I was communicating the style my hair used to have. She ruined my bang by cutting it way too wide. In the end she blowed all the cut hair inside my shirt and ruined my day because now I have to go home and take a shower because of this terrible haircut.<//review>

<review>This place was wonderful! I was three days away from my wedding and still had no stylist due to my lack of planning + time. My fiance (now husband) recommended this salon in the nick of time.

Made appointment for 10am. Later that day, got sick. Flu. (was already jet lagged to boot) Still wasn't better after two days. Called them around 9am on the same day I was supposed to be there and asked if I may change my appointment to 12:30pm. They obliged, and I was able to carryout my wedding ceremony without crashing. They were very understanding.

The lady who did my hair was super nice, very meticulous. She put her life and soul into my hair. She kept asking if I had any requests, any changes I'd like to make but nope. She did beautifully. And it only cost $65. (minus the tip)

Didn't catch her name, but she had a gorgeous asymmetrical short-cut, dyed blonde.</review>< Pictures>

The woman who cut my hair was very knowledgeable and treated my hair gently. I recommended my fiance also stop by here for a haircut, and they took the time to actually make sure the hairline on the back of his neck was even -- something a surprising number of other places have not done. Will definitely be back!<//Review>

When I walked in, I was brusquely told to sit down. Since I walked in near closing time, I tried to talk to someone to ask if I could still get a haircut that day, but was only more forcefully told to sit down again. I did ultimately get a haircut as soon as a stylist was available, which was solid and reasonably priced ($19), but I'm not sure I'll come back.<//text>

I tried to send this message to the owner only but could not find a way to do that from their website.  I thought I had found my new stylist when I had my consultation with Peter.  I was wrong.  I returned 2 days later and he did not remember me.  He did not listen to what I wanted and cut and styled my hair the way he wanted to.  I am now looking for someone to "fix" my hair.  Inexpensive but I will not be back.< /text>

<Review>I can't speak for women's haircuts, but this shop does a great job for men.  Neat, clean, efficient and great customer service.  They even clean your head, neck and face with a hot towel at the end.  Great prices, too.<//Review><username>Isaac H.

My hair was mid-back length and I asked to cut so it's 2-3 inches below the shoulder when DRY.  The stylist cut it to 1 inch below the shoulder when wet, which of course made my curly, fairly dry hair above the shoulder when dried.  The only good thing is that the haircut was fairly cheap and my hair grows fast, but for now, I will have to look like a mop for the next few months.  Will never go back there again!< /review>< pics>

<Text>I give this place one star because there is no way of giving it a no star.

I went there due to a referral. The hair cut came out horrible, did everything I wanted the opposite of it, after I tried to explain to them how I wanted the cut to be, and why I wanted it that way.

It was a waste of time and money, and a struggle trying to justify what I was trying to tell them. Driving away I asked myself why I was getting myself into the situation in the first place.

The fee structure was also outrageous. Stay away!!</Text>< GmapID>

I've been coming here for years.  The owners are friendly.  The smoothies and drinks are delicious.  I especially love their milk tea with boba (tapioca) and their avocado smoothie.  Their milk tea is made from actual tea and not from powder like a lot of places.  I've referred many people here and they agree that this place is delicious.  They're right next to 24 hour fitness.<//Text>

Great tasting Acai bowls for an affordable price. They are also a pretty good size.</review>

Way too expensive!!!  Over $8 for only three fruits... would’ve cost over $12 by the time I added in a few more items to make it how I wanted it. I’ll keep going to Ever Bowl - same size without the up-charge for topping choices. Not to mention, there’s too much ice blended with the açaí making it very bland and watery - definitely not worth the money. Two stars because the girl behind the counter was nice :/< /text>

Juice is awesome! Well made and clean facility. The reason I give three stars is because of the service. I tend to order a juice specifically that takes longer to make because it is fresh squeezed. Every time I walk in I feel like the workers see me as a burden because they don’t want to make this drink. I am only in here a few times a week at the most. I am giving my business and don’t feel appreciated as a customer. They always make a point as well to make my juice after other customers who ordered after me.<//Text>

< Review>
Juice Bar has been a staple in my life and family since I was little. This place makes the most delicious and affordable smoothies you'll ever taste. Flavors like mango bango and the chocolate are my favorites. I always enjoy adding on one of their pretzels too. This family ran business is a must on your list of places to try!< /Review>

I got the Amazon acai bowl and compared to other acai bowls I've tried this was very disappointing. The size of the item itself leads you to think that it'll be filling, but they add in quite a bit of ice into the acai to essentially make it an acai smoothie.

It's very watery, very little acai flavor. The best part of this was the fruit and granola but that's the best part of ANY acai bowl. On top of that it was $8.

The staff are also not very welcoming and you can tell the owners that work here don't like their jobs.

Only rating this two stars because their boba drinks are good (but I haven't been to a boba place that serves bad beverages, really).</Text>

Wonderful family staffed store. I come and get either a smoothie with double boba or a Hazelnut coffee double boba. I always have a positive experience here and have brought many friends here as well. I highly recommend this store for any drink.< /Text>

Tried the Acai bowl today and was kind of let down... $7.25 for an oversized cup (not a bowl) and was lacking some ingredients I have had elsewhere. No tangy zip to the flavor and the all but scarce granola felt old and bland. The place I normally go has a real bowl with a healthy serving of acai base, sliced banana, strawberry, blueberry and raspberry, covered in granola, shredded coconut and topped with bee pollen... for about $6 and change after tax. So.... sadly, rethinking my return here.</text>

Great service - I've been using another firm before, but enjoy working with Gold Rush Express more.

Their online portal UI is old, but get's the job done well. They kept me in the loop with any delays and their email notifications for deliveries is very helpful.</text>

Had a last minute work-related need today and I called them before 8:00 am and Patrick answered the phone immediately, described their process and quoted me a price right away. I received an email once the courier got to the pickup destination (right on time) and received my items within the hour as planned with no issues and the exact cost as quoted. Highly recommend this business for other businesses that need a trustworthy and professional courier service . Thank you Patrick and team!</Text>

At the very end of the day when it still had not arrived, I called the company and found out there was a "glitch" and the cake was still halfway across the country.  I had to really hustle, but found a local bakery who could get a cake ready for me just an hour before they closed and located Gold Rush Delivery online and they saved the day, picking up the cake and delivering to the group home where this kid lives.  He was so happy and excited to get a cake to share with his friends.  Thank you!<//Text>< user>

I needed a prescription picked up from the pharmacy and I could not leave the house due to high risk for the Virus.  Gold Rush did a great job picking it up and delivering the prescription to my home.  I did not know what I would have done if this service was not available.  everyone I worked with were wonderful.  I will recommend to anyone who needs such a service!<//Review>

Gold Rush Express was a great help to us. We had a 900 pound shipment on New Years Eve and could not get any of the big freight company's to come in and pick up at the last minute for us. We called Gold Rush ( our first time to use them ). They were able to make room for us, not only to pick up, but at a very fair price. No Expedite fees, etc.... They also delivered our local shipment the very next business day. Very courteous and polite. Would recommend them to anyone needing freight services.</text>

<review>I have used Gold Rush service countless times for shipping stuff all over the bay area.  Often they deliver before  the stated window and I never worry about it getting there.  Usually cheaper then next day service from one of the major carriers and you also don't need to double box or go crazy with the packaging.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x808fcc72dc84d251:0x4f472a74bc38368b<//gmap_id></record>

I called for service in mid-day for a rush order with included both a pickup at one location and a delivery at another distant location. The agent who I worked with understood immediately what I needed to have done, schedule the pick up and made the delivery perfectly. I received two calls on the progress of the pick up and the expected time of delivery and both were right on target. Can't thank Gold Rush enough for the incredible service.<//review>

I had a great experience with Gold Rush Delivery. We had a package that absolutely, positively, had to be delivered from San Jose to San Francisco on the same day.  The reason? A well-known chef had to sample some Japanese Shochu we'd received, so he could prepare matching dishes for a big event this weekend.

I called Gold Rush. Thee call was answered quickly, my info was taken, and the delivery was confirmed. Barely an hour later, we had a gentleman from Gold Rush Express Delivery at the door, who took my package and was off and running.  Well, he was off and driving, but you get the idea.

I don't envy anybody who has to deliver to downtown SF in the early afternoon. I know full well what a nightmare that can be. I'm very happy to say that my package was delivered safe and sound!

I am happy to say that I would definitely use this company again.< /review>

We had never used a courier service before, but thought I'd give Gold Rush a call to see if they could help us out. We needed a part delivered to our shop as soon as possible.

Great company to work with. Patrick was great and efficient. Answered the phone on the three occasions I called. (I called another place and had to leave a message - they have never called me back). They came and picked up the pallet of material the next day and delivered it as promised. Customer and I were more than pleased with the service.<//review>

Quick to respond to a late Friday request.  We had a hiccup at the pickup, but Driver was great working with us to let us resolve and still get it delivered.  Communication was great confirming delivery.

They got the job done with no hassles or unpleasant surprises.  I would use them again without question.< /Review>

From out of state, I arranged a delivery between two CA locations about one hour's drive apart.  The service was fast, which I didn't really need, but they handled my package more carefully than going through a courier with a distribution center.  You pay for the service, but if you can't risk damage, or you need it fast, then Gold Rush is worth it.<//review>

Chose Gold Rush because their quote was the most economical and also got the job done beautifully, way ahead of the delivery window. Will definitely use them again!<//review>

I did get a call at 5:30 PM advising me the delivery person was on their way from some distance away. To the credit of this service they offered a 50% discount for my delivery costs.

Even tho the cost of my parts was crazy outrageous.  That was to be expected since I drive a Lincoln. The crew was amazing. They treated me good thru the process and were honest with me the whole way. No unnecessary charges here. Thanks to all at gills.. You helped me above and beyond.<//review>

So thankful for the service I received at Gills. My air conditioning went Kaput on the first heatwave of the year!🤦‍♀️ Called Gill’s Motor Works on the holiday weekend and they got me in immediately. They gave me a honest estimate and a fair price.These guys don’t mess around. They got the job done in a few hours time, during the heatwave might I add. My a/c is back to working brand new like the day I bought it. I will be using Gill’s motor works for my future repairs and you should too!</review>

< review>
The mechanics at this shop are kind and honest, and their prices are fair. My car broke down the day before I had planned to drive back home to Florida, and, luckily, they were the closest mechanic. I left my car right outside their shop (it was a Sunday) and the next day they had it fixed within hours. One of the mechanics even offered to pick me up after realizing that I didn’t have a ride and that I was about to walk a long distance to get my car. I highly recommend.< /review>

Scott was great, I called to see if they can help me. He told me a way that would fix my issue without coming in. My car doesn’t have a gas cap so I had to go in and they were very clear on the issues and so forth. Was even kind enough to call me first and then call my boyfriend to explain to him and let him give them the okay after I told them too. Even did a tune up and my car has been running great so far.<//review>

<Review>I thought I was going to have to pay 500 for new shocks and struts, they took it out and came back at me with, "just a sway bar link" I fixed that myself for much less. These guys are honest and quick, I came in at the end of the day with no appointment, they took care of me anyway.<//Review>< time>

We always test drive every customers car before completeing a work order. Sometimes ebrake hardware can fail also not allowing the shoes to touch the rotor. If you can contact us so we can help please do. We do not want a unsatisfied customer. 🙂'}< /Resp>< Text>
I had gotten a brake and rotor job all around for my girlfriend car. Before I arrived my E/parking brake was working fine, she uses it to park daily. I am afraid after doing my research that the ebrake was not adjusted back properly and was highly disappointed when I got it checked by another company to confirm my issue. After spending what I did you would think the job would be done right.  We do not even live in Chico to get this situation resolved. IF YOU GET A JOB LIKE THIS DONE HERE, PLEASE GO GET THE JOB CHECKED.( BRAKES ARE NOTHING TO PLAY WITH)<//Text>

<review>I just got my oil changed over at Gill’s, not only are they one of the most affordable in town they are also the most friendly and personable. They got me in and out in record time and were very accommodating when I asked them if they could check on other things while my car was there, they did that with no hesitation. I will definitely be coming back to Gill’s for any future car needs I have.

<review>I highly recommend these guys! Not only are they the ONLY repair shop in Chico but they do an incredible job helping our. Other places in town charge anywhere from $50-$129 for a diagnosis and these guys did it for free! Not only that but they are priced extremely fairly, seem to be watching out for their customers and do a great job taking care of your car. Thank you guys SOOO much for getting my car taken care of so quickly and efficiently. It’s much appreciated. I highly recommend these guys and am sure with all the car issues my Hyundai has, I’ll be back.</review>< time>

Excellent mechanics! I highly recommend Gill's Motorworks. Excellent Quality Service, great parts and prices! You won't find a better affordable place to take your vehicle. Down to earth and relatable to all your needs. I took my truck there and Josh diagnosed, found, and fixed the problem. I will be taking all my vehicles to Gills from now on. Thanks guys!!</text>

I love this place. I am pretty mechanically savvy and these guys take it to another level. After I worked on my car for almost two weeks, I took it to a different mechanic place. Like I, they couldn't figure out the issue, but wanted to start throwing a bunch of money at it without a clue of what was going on. Ultimately I took it to Gills. Within minutes Gills gave a logical prediction to the issue which was way beyond my technical understanding. They gave a really good step through outline of how best to get the project done and the estimated cost.  Not only did they get right to work and actually fixed the issue, they got it done cheaper than they quoted. Can't beat that! Now i am happily back on the road :-) Thanks Gills!!!</review>

<text>I was in a minor collision and my rear bumper needed to be repaired.  I dropped my car off and got a call within a couple of hours to pick it up. They did a great job and were very friendly. The price was reasonable and I was very pleased with the quality of service. I will definitely be returning to Gills Motorworks if my car needs anything!< /text>< rate>

Patrick the owner is great all his employees are great as well. I’ve gone to him a couple different times over the last couple years. They are honest and that’s hard to get out of mechanics. They do really great work at a excellent price. He’s worked on my integra and 4 runner never had a problem. Always works hard and is negotiable. Please keep up the great work!!</Review>

Gills Motorworks is the best auto shop in the area. They do good quality work for an affordable price. Max is very knowledgeable in his field and stays in communication with you along the way about what he finds and how he plans to fix it. Having fixed multiple issue with many of my vehicles, I would trust max to fix any problem with my vehicles in the future.<//text>

HANDS DOWN BEST AUTOMOTIVE MECHANICS & SHOP YOU WILL EVER FIND!!!!
I called to inquire about work getting done on car that we currently had been driving on our trip to cali,  the Shop was closing for weekend during the holidays. Josh was so understanding without to detailed explanation as to what needed repair; they still stayed open so he could change spark plugs on our vehicle that was misfiring during our road trip up the coast. Patricks price was a quarter of other shops and instead of four hours only took 45 minutes. You cant ask for more then good honest work at a realistic price, without extra hidden fees for nonsense. Not to mention the mechanic Josh and owner Patrick are not only studmuffins to look at but very hospitable and welcoming. They made the experience of a broken car in the middle of foreign town the most amazing experience ever!!! I only wish I could keep them to be my forever mechanics. Remember this if there's two things in life that you keep forever when you find a great one it's a hair stylist/ Barber & mechanic!! Regardless if I have a broken car or not I will be stopping in Chico to get it serviced next time I'm in that area for sure.< /Text>

Gills was my fourth auto shop I had called about a diagnostic on my vehicle because my ignition coils were messing up. The gentlemen there named Chris was so helpful over the phone I explained how money was tight and I commute to work everyday from Yuba so my car is my lifeline and he heard me out and did some research on the computer to help me find the best solution in my price range and he was able to squeeze me in on such short notice. It ended up being cheaper than we both expected so that was amazing! I’ve been in NorCal for three years and haven’t really found an auto shop that works for me until I spoke with Chris thank you from the bottom of my heart and thank the rest of the Auto-works team I appreciate u!!!! I will definitely be coming back for all my mechanical issues!< /Review>

I am so grateful for the team at Gills Motorworks! I broke down outside of Chico on my way to Utah and was towed to Gills.  The customer service was superb while they explained my car's status! They spent time troubleshooting then completely dismantled my motor to replace the timing belt and rebuilt it in one day's time. I was able to get back on the road the same day to get to my next job. I highly recommend these guys and look forward to bringing my vehicle in for the next round of tune up when I make it back to CA. Chico is now on my map and Gills Motorworks an A1 stop!<//review>

I didn't have time to do an actual diagnosis, so I got my truck towed to Gill's where I found their free inspection included a visual, sound or plug and read (like an obd2 read for you chack engine light), but my problem was not covered by this free inspection. I told them, I really needed it fixed "TODAY" and, somehow, they got it done for me. They were running a brake special, so I had them change my rotors and pads on the front while I was there. They even let me know about a problem with my CV boot so I would be aware of futur problems. They were super friendly and personable. They have a compatible price and they are willing to price match if you have been calling around checking prices.</Text>< Pics>

< Review>
My husband and I broke down on the way to our campground at Lassen on a Friday afternoon.  We got towed into Chico, and started looking around on Saturday morning to see if any mechanics were open.  Patrick opened his shop especially to help us out, and worked on the car nonstop until he figured out what was wrong.  He got us back on the road by 2:30 and completely saved our weekend.  Our car (a Honda Accord) is running really well, and we made our 200-mile drive back home without any trouble.  His prices were also extremely reasonable--we're really happy we took the car to him!<//Review>

Gills told me it was gonna cost me $872.93 to replace a vtech solenoid and to replace my spark plugs. Well I'm a camp fire survivor and didnt have any money but $10 dollars to my name. So I said I would come back when I had some money. I put the word out that I needed help. A friend sent me to Jim's Auto repair and he told me my spark plugs were in good shape and replaced the vetch solenoid for a total of 152.65. Now Gills said the reason it would cost so much was because of the labor. They said it was hard to get to and it would take 4 1/2 hours to do. Jim's auto repair did it in less then 30 minutes. I feel just sick how taken advantage of I feel. I thought he was doing me a solid. Wow, just wow.

Update: I talked to Gills Motorworks. He apologized and discussed the misunderstanding. Thanks for the call.</Review>< Pictures>

The gents at Gills did an excellent job determining the noise coming from my vehicle and resolving it. Honest hardworking crew over there with no intention to hike prices to those who may not know much about vehicle troubles.

They've got my business for whatever issues may arise in the future.

Thanks guys!<//Text>

I havent had a real work done here YET, but I brought my jeep in twice within a week or so for 2 different FREE inspections. And they were quick and to the point. They didnt try to sell me something I didnt need like some other places might. These people are just great and honest worker. Now I feel I must say the only inspections that are free are just visual ones where they dont have to take anything apart.</Text>

<rating>5</rating><Review>ATTENTION ALL WOMEN (men can read too 😂)... As women we usually know very little about cars and/or the cost of car repairs. We are out of our element and easily targeted as suckers to most automotive shops. Many of us are simply willing to pay whatever it takes to get our vehicles back on the road. There are plenty of shops in our community that have no problem robbing us blind without giving a second thought to the fact we are someone's mother, grandmother, sister, daughter.... THIS IS NOT THE CASE AT GILL'S MOTORWORKS !!!! What they offer is quality auto care with a dose of integrity. I am a hands on grandmother to an 8 yr. old autistic boy who depends on me to suit up and show up everyday. Because of the timely manner in which my repairs were completed we were back on the road in less than a day. My repairs were "MORE THAN AFFORDABLE". I am beyond impressed with how I was treated and will go to great lengths to provide GILL'S MOTORWORKS with referrals every chance I get. If I'm ever asked, "Do you know of a good mechanic that's affordable?"... My guaranteed response is going to be, "JOSH HENDON AT GILL'S MOTORWORKS" 😎 !!!!!<//Review>< pictures>

<review>If I could give negative stars I would! Absolutely without a doubt the single worst repair shop I've had the misfortune of dealing with! I am a Camp Fire survivor and took my car in after the fire bcuz if suffered a lot of damage. I was told that it was gonna cost almost $4000 to fix everything but when I got it back they said it be like brand new. But before they'd even touch it the owner Patrick Gill wanted the full amount paid upfront deposited into his account! After paying they took 2 months to get my car back to me. When I showed up to get it the tires were extremely low from sitting so long. I had to go right to gas station to air them up. For $4000 you'd think they'd do that as a courtesy but what it told me was it wasn't even test driven. Right away I could tell it wasn't fixed. The check engine light is still on! I took it back and they told me I needed an alignment! They won't make it right and now I have to go thru B.A.R and small claims. Save yourself the grief and find a professional honest shop that won't rip you off bcuz this guy will!<//review><Resp>{'time': 1559259967727, 'text': 'This coming from  a liar and lady who just landed herself for stealing all ove the news.. yep shes a fraud  https://www.actionnewsnow.com/content/news/Chico-Street-Crimes-Unit-16-arrests-made-512321092.html'}<//Resp>< Time>

<text>Free inspection and friendly helpful shop. You will told the truth about what's wrong, not told to replace what does not need to be replaced. My dodge dakota was inspected in red bluff at Bob's and I was told I needed to replace my entire suspension when i only needed a few bolts tightened and sway bar end caps. Less than $100 in parts. Where I was told between $400-500 in parts in red bluff. A much more honest shop.</text>< user>

<text>Honestly the best place I chose to go to in Chico. After having intermittent starting issues with my Taurus, I was able to tell them my issue and they quickly found the problem. Which lucky me wasn't "oh its  a Ford" this time.Yes I've been told that. While in the process of repairing one issue( bad spark plugs), they made sure I knew about the rear spark plugs which are inconveniently underneath a thing( forgot the name of said thing, maybe  manifold?) and absolutely a pain in the butt to get too, being covered in oil(because of worn valve gaskets). I was able to get a qoute for both items needing replacing for a more than fair price.I will definitely be back in the future. Thanks a bunch!<//text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

Very quickly got my car up and running again. Super friendly service and it was obvious the owner Patrick really cares about his customers.<//review>

< review>
By far the worst customer service. I'm only giving this a 5-star rating so that I can try and save the next sad soul who comes across this shop. I bought a ridiculously overpriced Honda from Patrick back in March. As a single mom and a first-time car buyer I feel extremely taken advantage of. I was promised a full covered warranty on this car on everything but the transmission. This car has had problems from the beginning it started with issues on the tires and just escalated from there when it decided not to start one day. So I personally paid to get the car towed to Patrick shop he then "fix's" the car and not shortly after do more problems arise. I finally had another mechanic take a look at the car he found tools and bolts under the hood and the radiator wasn't even bolted in and told that the work done on the car was a joke and that I should try to definitely go and get my money back. Obviously at this point we are far too gone to get anything back from this, I'm out $3000 and my old 97 Honda. So I give Patrick another call no answer so I called the shop and no answer so I called his phone again he picks up and hangs up on me at this point I'm furious. We finally got the car running and I show up back at Patricks shop he is not there so I talk with his mechanics who are more than willing to help than Patrick even seems . I am them CHARGED $500 for repairs, I refuse to pay when I stated I had a full warranty on the car. We finally came to terms and I ended up paying $50 for a very small amount of work and the car still wasn't fixed. So finally today my car won't start I give Patrick a call ( from my new number keep in mind) and he answers. Tells me he will call me back and we will get it all fixed he promised. HE TURNED HIS PHONE OFF. There is no professional bone in this guy's body so beware to all who enter this shitshow.</review>

I cant believe the service I got . ON Monday I came to the garage because my headlamps.wouldnt come.on . I brought along with my the turn signal switch  he said he would replace it for 100.00  they replaced the switch but it didnt solve the problem I was told to come back on Thursday morning . On Thursday morning I arrived at 9am and I was told  I dont have time for your vehicle today  come back Monday. I told him that your mechanic told me to come Thursday.  As the representative walked away said " I dont know what to tell you " he just walked away and left me sitting.there on the couch . That was rude customer service and I'm sure you guys will find plenty of time on your hands when more people complain about your  customer service.  Get some.skills  go to school ...< /Text>

<text>The guys down at Gils will take good care of you. Patrick, the owner is a real person and will level with you on what's going on with your vehicle without confusing the non-mechanically savy. He plainly laid out what he would do to it if it was his car, and then what the other options were. Processing took a little longer than other mechanics but I prefer it this way because I was able to really talk about he problem. I feel like other places they can't wait to get you to sign the agreement and usher you out the door.

His mechanic James was efficient and knowledgeable, after installing my new brakes he test drove the vehicle and decided to soften the tension a little, I've always hated how abruptly my car would brake and now that's gone without me even remembering to ask. I could tell he was wrenching on my car as if it was his own.

10/10 I will be bringing my Subaru by soon for them to fix problems not only caused by pep boys but problems that pep boys was unable to fix after they caused it. Within seconds of describing the problem Patrick had an idea of what they were missing and thinks he can fix it.</text>< rate>

I kept getting told it was the compressor and getting quoted $800.00 and most mechanics charge up the butt just to check your car it is outrageous!!! Well now winter is approaching and having no air hot or cold I got scared about not having a defroster have to see to drive well I came across a video on Facebook saying that Gills does free inspections drove down here today from Corning got a free inspection I now have air it was not the compressor and it only cost me $90.00 these guys are amazing had my kids with me they were so polite and professional as long as I am in the in Nor-Cal Gills motorsports will have mine and my familys business. I could not be happier thank God for these mechanics so hard to find honest mechanics that are there because they truly care for the customer and not to just rip people off. I highly recommend these guys 10 star rating for sure 😊😊😊😊< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80832633d4ddd4fd:0x119a20e44bb2f21b</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<rating>1< /rating><review>My buddy went there to get a light installed. The employee left a roll of electrical tape under the hood of his car. As he drove in the freeway to work the next day, the hood flew open. Smashing his windshield, and the rear view mirror broke and cut his leg open. He called Gil's the next day asking if the mechanic had left the roll of tape in his car. He said "yes, I did. Can you bring it back?". My friend then told him the story of what happened. The man asked to call my friend back. After my friend had been hung up on many times, the mechanic told my friend "I found my tape. I don't know what to tell you." The owners are ferusing to pay. Or even admit any fault. My friend has photos of the roll of tape stuck under the hood. DONT EVER TAKE YPUR CAR HERE. They are NOT honest people.< /review>< pictures>

<Text>I come here all the time. I love this place. It is beautiful and the therapists do an incredible job. I always get the deep tissue because I need a lot of pressure for my muscles.

< Review>
I absolutely loved my experience! I didn’t have to wait months for a consultation or for an appointment!! The whole staffing is always so welcoming with smiles on their face. I went in super nervous but Everyone was so kind and made me feel super comfortable. I love to joke around and I am so happy they were not bothered by it one bit as many places are. The fact that Dr. Shah & Monica follow up on you even over the weekend is AMAZING! They are One call/text away if you have any questions or concerns  <3

It’s been about two weeks from my first procedure and I see some amazing results. Results that I never thought I would see. I’m already planning another visit in the future 😉< /Review>

Aahhhh-mazing.. I love going to this spa, the girls are amazing and know what they are doing. It's so relaxing and they definitely make you feel comfortable. Monica is amazing and great at what she does, she will answer all you questions. I get my Brazilian laser hair removal with Jessica and she makes me feel so comfortable like I've known her forever and not awkward at all. I highly recommend this place, you will not regret it and they also have the best prices in town.</review>

This business is the most difficult to deal with I've ever encountered.  It took me a few calls to setup an initial appointment.  Once I arrived, I was informed that I made an appointment with the wrong person based on what I needed (laser treatments) - as if I was to blame.  I'm not sure how they expect me to know who does what, so that was Strike 1 for me.  Strike 2 came when I finally did see the right person about a week later.  Her attitude was rather sharp and not focused at all on the customer - very self-centered.  She made me feel like I was inconveniencing her with my presence.

Still, after the quick skin test, I decided that I'd let them do the procedure sometime in January or February.  Since they were having a sale on gift cards during the month of December, I called the following week (week of Christmas) to find out when they'd be available, but no one answered or returned my voice message.  I tried again the following week and still got no answer.  On Wednesday (30 December) at around 2 p.m., I drove to their location to discover that they shut down for the rest of the year as of the afternoon of 29 December (the previous day).  There was no mention of this on their website or anywhere else.  They just decided to close shop without warning.  Strike 3.

Yet, I decided to call today to give them one more chance, but only if they would honor the gift card discount.  I called this morning around 10 and this afternoon at 4:30.  Still, no answer (they are showing to be open until 7 p.m.).  My advice is to not bother with these people.  If they are this difficult to reach, their quality of service can't be that good.  In any case, a very frustrating experience.< /text>

This is an amazing amazing little hole in the wall deli. We stopped by here to pick up some sandwiches to take to a brewery after a long hike in Mission Trails, and it was well worth the detour. Customer service is outstanding and super friendly, menu has everything you could want, prices are super reasonable, and both sandwiches were delicious.

The San Diego Native has turkey, avocado, tomato, bacon, and sprouts. Amazeballs. If you love sandwiches and you’re anywhere in the vicinity, GO HERE.< /text>

You can make nearly not all, protein style. They use iceberg lettuce for it. Only two people in the store at a time and you wait outside to order. This is the COVID-19 rule.</Text>

Once inside the person taking my order was excited to explain the sandwiches, they really knew their menu very well. I went with the suggestion of the "Chomp" sandwich. This sandwich was very good and extremely filling. It was loaded with turkey and roast beef, it was delicious. Well done!<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

Amy, Danny, and the lovely woman who helps Amy are AMAZING!! I can't tell you how much they help me out when I have a catering snafu (aka 30 min until Aerospace executives need to eat) and they're always on time. They care about you like you're their best friend. I can't tell you how supportive they were when my dog was attacked. I messed up an order and not only did they fix it, but they have asked every delivery since how she's doing. 10/10!!</Text>

The veggie here is great. Definitely a good lunch spot if you're vegetarian, but everyone else seems to love it too. Customer service is first-rate as well. My go-to spot when I am in El Cajon.< /text>

My favorite sandwich is the chicken cordon bleu. I highly recommend it, it's delicious. This place gets busy around lunchtime so expect a short wait time, it's worth it. The sandwiches are also fairly priced.< /Review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>The Cajon Pass Deli gives a ‘Mom & Pop shop’ meaning. The customer service alone keeps me coming back time and time again. It’s just hands down the best sandwich spot in San Diego. I’ve had a fair share of sanwiches at many different sandwich shops, all I have to say is if you’re looking for a variety of quality meats, breads, and salads- look no further this place has it all.

Very rude lady came and delivered food we canceled...she did not even knock just opened the door and walked in...we explained to her that we cancelled the order and she then started arguing with us, said we called when no call was ever made, told us to never order from them and called is aholes...this was the worst service i ever got for something i cancelled.< /Text>

I loved everything about my visit at SaunaBar! The owner Joseph, and Darcy, front desk, are super friendly and go above and beyond to create the most welcoming and comfortable experience. The environment is extremely clean, and overall very relaxing! I can't say enough good things about SaunaBar, but I will definitely be back soon for another sauna and lymphatic massage!<//review>

<user_id>105747716437880742399< /user_id><review>If you want a full body detox and relaxing experience this is the place to be, and yes it really works! I use the lymphatic drainage and then straight into the infrared sauna pod to sweat out all the toxins and firm and tone the body and skin. I also use the magnasphere which has been an amazing experience. My whole body tingles and vibrates with energy while totally relaxing my mind, I feel an over all healing after each session. All the  supplements they have on offer to further compliment the sessions are also of the highest quality. Darcy is always a delight! Thanks sauna bar!<//review>< Pictures>

Wow!

It was my first time at SaunaBar and I wasn't completely sure what to expect.

Unfortunately like many, I suffer from tension and extreme stiffness which is caused by my own anxiety and stress. The tension sometimes takes a tole on my shoulders, neck and jaw that even prescribed medication cannot solve.

After I let them know what my intentions were of my visit (relax, de-clench if you will), it was recommended that I try the vibration machine (20 min) followed by an infrared sauna session (40 min). After my sessions, my body become so relaxed (jello state) that it even had my sinuses draining!

Great place to de-stress and I cannot recommend this enough. Thank you SaunaBar!< /text>

The two relieves my stress that builds up over the week along with the stress from COVID. I also love SaunaBar’s Infrared Lamp that is amazing at repairing dry skill and makes my face very smooth like a baby. Finally Darcy is amazing and so friendly and helps put my mind at ease. Joseph the owner is also very friendly and helpful.<//Review>< userid>

Worst customer service. I was laughed at on the phone for asking questions about the spa, as I have never been. She told me to go look online.  I never recommend this place to anyone. Go to Tonic Bar on Beverly they are extremely nice and welcoming and very clean.<//review>

< review>
My Lymphatic drainage massage today was not good. I've had them in the past and experienced wonderful results with one session. Sauna Bar's lymphatic machine is not the same quality as the Ballencer Pro  machine used on my previous drainage massages. I didn't realize the machines are not the same quality untill today when no change occurred in my swelling, which is not normal! Totally disappointing and a complete waste of money!

RESPONSE UPDATE TO OWNER 3/7/20:  Dear Owner, your staff and I NEVER discussed me having Lymphedema.  I've seen a physician and I do not have Lymphedema. How unprofessional for your response to state that the customer has a medical condition without knowing the facts or speaking with the customer. The staff barely spoke more than a few words to me because they were busy with other people. It wasn't until I was about to leave that I was told results take a minimum of 4 sessions.  To have no change confirms the quality of your equipment. The equipment is simply not the same grade as the Ballencer Pro and that's why it takes 4 sessions to see results. Furthermore, your establishment is unprofessional as stated in other reviews. New customers please BEWARE!!< /review>

We understand that this is a difficult condition to deal with and wish you all the best.'}</Response>< gmap_id>

SaunaBar is my favorite infrared sauna studio.  These pods help me with detoxing, reducing inflammation, workout recovery, reducing stress, and overall feeling amazing.  The bonus is that you can burn up to 500 calories in these pods too! The 40 minutes in my individual pod is the perfect place to meditate.  Their pods are very comfortable and your head is completely out of the pod to breathe in the fresh air and essential oils if you choose to use them there.  If you're in LA, you should definitely book a session.</Text>

I have had the pleasure to work with Joseph for the past month. I am a weight loss skeptic but really needed the kickstart and was recommended by a friend. A lot of eye rolling was involved the first day, but I bought in and kept to the regimen. I exceeded my weight loss goal and currently am maintaining - the most important part. I found the instructions and the protocol Easy to follow, and Joseph's personal follow up with me to check on my progress was tops. I couldn't believe I was eating so little but feeling so satisfied. I (re) learned how to cook and to eat. This has gone on long enough to have become a habit, which is the cornerstone to success in weight loss - make life changes. In short, two thumbs up for Joseph and SaunaBar.< /review>

I loved it. The experience was awesome on a cellular level .....I felt stress & blockages being released as I relaxed into my float.  It's also fun to dance or shake your body being weightless. I felt re-booted & so happy after experience. Thank you to Raschi- . She took care of everything & made me feel so comfortable! Def going again.<//text>

<text>Went to sauna bar during pregnancy as feet started to swell and within a few days of giving birth to baby boy as I had edema post 36 hour labor and c-section. I was in incredible pain from all the swelling and wanted to get the fluid retention under control. In combination with acupuncture, in-home massage and the lymphatic I was able to lose 24 pounds of my 32 gained in a few days!!! My docs had told me I’d just need to give it time and while i was open to doing that I wanted to do everything I could to speed up the process. This worked wonders for me! I felt better and detoxed from the stress and water weight of labor/delivery really quickly. Within a week of this regimen I was down 27 pounds! I would highly recommend SaunaBar for all the cool gadgets they have to help you feel your best. I swear by the lymphatic and the meditation chair. The infrared is beautiful too, just can’t do it right now due to breastfeeding.<//text>< date>

<GmapID>0x80c2bebadc125c25:0x8ea7673de332cab1<//GmapID><review>SaunaBar has changed my life, seriously!! I went there because I was very unhappy with how much weight I had gained and I didn’t know where to start so I decided to try the Transformation program. I met Joseph, the owner on my first day and he was so kind and down to earth and completely honest with me regarding my part in this program that I knew exactly what I was signing up for. I am 13lbs down and I feel amazing! If I can do this program anyone can. The support of the wonderful amazing ladies that work there is priceless!! They truly care and take a genuine interest in your goals and answered all the questions that I had with such encouragement and kindness that without them I don’t know if I could have done this. I am so thrilled that I walked into SaunaBar. I’ll keep you posted on my end results in two weeks. I would give SaunaBar 100 stars if I could!< /review>< pictures>

Amazing technology that helps heal the soul and body. Nothing like ending a day with a sauntering go of any stress. 10 out of 10 for sure. Also!! One of the only facilities known to use both near and far infrared. It's truly one of a kind.</Text><rating>5</rating>< userid>

<Text>I have been going to Firm Body Evolution since 2009, when it was at it's previous location.  First of all, this new location is FANTASTIC, and they have excellent parking in the back.  Overall, the facility itself is spotless and always very clean.  The Staff is excellent, and the owner Joseph is a really great person who started this place based on his passion to find a better way.  Personally, I am a huge fan of their 10/20/30 program and method that they use.  In 1 hour, I can cover my fitness, detox, and relaxation, with their unique equipment that they have that I have not been able to find elsewhere.

They have great Personal Training there as well, and if you need a weight loss program, they have that also.  Overall, if you are looking for a unique fitness experience and atmosphere, this is the place.  After 30 minutes in the infrared sauna, you will be hooked like I was!<//Text>< pics>

This place really is five stars. I was hunting around LA desperately trying to find something that offered everything in one place and Firm Body Evolution definitely does that. What I particularly like is there isn't crazy training there that bulks you up but quite the opposite with an emphasis on long and lean and they really do get fantastic results. The team are incredibly welcoming, polite and flexible. You do what is right for you and your body which is so important. Check it out!</Text>

Their infrared sauna pods have helped clear my skin, relieve pain, and reduce my bloating. My anxiety has melted away and I sleep like a baby thanks to these pods.

The lymphatic compression massage is my other favorite service. I always fall asleep and feel much more limber after these massages. No human can do the job that the compression massage machine does.

I also can’t say enough about how good the service and facility is. The staff is very educated and helpful as well. I highly recommend SaunaBar to anyone who wants to relieve stress, reduce anxiety, relieve pain, and to feel younger and more vibrant.</Review>< Pics>

I'm so glad I stumbled on this place in January.  I was looking to add another program to my Pilates routine.  I had decided I wanted to lose some weight because because my lower back was bothering me.  I was sure my back problem was do to the pounds I had put on since my retirement 9 years ago.

I signed up for the 23 day Detox program, thinking it would be very difficult to complete, but worth giving it a try.  As it turned out the program was not difficult to stick to and I decided to extend it to 41 days.  I was never hungry and I lost the weight I had gained.  As a result I have no more back issues.

I still use the equipment to stay in shape.  I would say my favorite is the lymphatic massage because I tend to retain fluid and it helps alleviate that, but all the equipment is great and each has a specific purpose to help keep the body healthy.

The staff is very friendly and helpful and the facility is a beautiful oasis; always bright and clean.< /Text>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>I came across Firm Body Evolution when I was diagnosed with cancer.  Firm Body Evolution provided a space where I was able to continue a fitness regimen in a serene, clean and personalized environment.  Though I chose not to utilize the infrared saunas until my recovery phase, I strongly believe that it is with the help of yoga instructor and personal trainer Jacob who got me through nearly 9 months of grueling chemotherapy and radiation treatments.  He designed a 30-minute customized program which included cardiovascular exercise and weight trainings so I may endure my medical treatments, and on days when I was too weak to even walk, Jacob enlisted me in sessions of restorative yoga. It is these 30-minute programs, the tranquil and uncrowded environment, and the care and expertise of Jacob, which makes Firm Body Evolution in a fitness category all by itself.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

All too often a workout that should have taken only an hour takes two.  I found FBE and it was such a welcome change.  Quiet.  Peaceful.  No waiting and no hurry either.  And best of all, I tried their 10-20-30 and in one hour, start to finish, I got a great work out and a full 30 minutes of infrared sauna.  I left feeling really refreshed and ready for whatever came along.  Very nice staff too.  There to answer questions but not intrusive.  They also offer private training and as soon as I can I'm going to sign up.  I highly recommend FBE to anyone who wants a solid workout that will leave you stress-free in only an hour.<//Review>< Pictures>

<text>Very hard to believe the low-impact machines I was instructed to use by one of the very informative trainers were actually giving me a workout! But you'll believe it has after you've left and your body is aching in the most delightful way - only after the natural body high from the infrared jade sauna wears off though. :b

Loved the body analysis that they gave me before the workout as well that informed me that I would benefit from having an extra 5 lbs of muscle.

Truly no other place to experience this cutting edge workout / technology.

I’ve been to esalen many times, the Beverly Hot Springs and more than a few spas. SaunaBar is the Apple store for simple, effective and convenient wellness and restoration in the city. The 35 minute infrared sauna was like a 2 hour soak in a hot tub. The lymphatic massage put me into a relaxed trance that lasted the entire 30 minute session. The space is so beautiful, impeccable and serene. It’s no wonder thatbin one hour I could be restored at the end of a busy day when I was just about wiped out.
I went on to an evening of work and study, restored, clean, and happy.<//review>

<Review>I was complaining about how the gyms out here aren't good and I feel uncomfortable using machines covered in sweat from others, as well as being hit on by disrespectful  patrons with no consequences, not to mention no parking etc etc. My first experience with FBE was definitely not my last, they've got a ton of parking in the back, private facility, very clean, the locker room had a lot of space so I could easily go before or after work. Their infrared saunas put my mind and body at ease and their patio has a great view of the hills which is pretty inspiring and motivational. I liked the alkaline water they gave me, it's reverse osmosis process has cancer killing elements which have me thinking about drinking it more often and their machines are state of the art! I don't want to say it's the best spa / gym in Los Angeles or West Hollywood, but I will say I've loved my experiences thus far and will tell friends.

I signed up with the SaunaBar to treat my sinusitis. The infrared facial lamp helped drain and shrink my sinus glands. The results are visible as my face is no longer so puffy. I continue to use the silver product to keep my sinuses clear. I really appreciate having this service available to me.< /review>

I open the door and enter into a serene atmosphere. The quiet meditative music is soothing to my tense body driving the 405 freeway. Joseph, the owner greets me when I walk in with a smile. He engages me in conversation & proceeds to show me around the simple yet beautifully elegant facility. Rich preserved roses elegantly adorn the suite.

Joseph attentively showed me around and I was escorted into the Magnesphere room. Once settled the calm that washed over my body was tangible.

Being a Breast cancer survivor with Lymphedema this was the most relaxing hour I have had in a while. Afterwards I took a drink of the healthy water sold there. I left refreshed, energized & wanting more. Highly recommend.

Cannot wait to go back for a more in-depth treatment on the Magesphere.<//Review>

My experience at FBE Spa was phenomenal!!! A trainer walked me through a series of exercises on their vibrations machine for about 30-40 min and I felt my body energized and new!!!
He was patient and very knowledgable.
Then I went to the infrared sauna for other 30 min and I felt I got a new body!!!
I highly recommend the any of FBE programs!!!</review>

Their 10/20/30 method really works.The staff is amazing. Jourdan who manages the place also evaluates your own personal diet and makes changes to ensure that your body is performing at it's peak! FBE's total body detox on a "cellular level" is awesome....so far lost over 20 pounds of pure fat!! My personal trainer, Christian, consistently runs me through an intense results-driven workout.
I highly recommend this place for total body transformation. My friends and colleagues are amazed at the results. The motivation and support I have received from the staff is great and keeps me going back for more. Also, their weekly body composition reports make sure just fat is being lost and muscle is being gained.
Check out this place immediately!< /Review>< pics>

< Review>
As a pilates instructor I'm constantly in action.  Whenever I work too much, or work OUT too much it flares up my fibromyalgia symptoms. I am forever grateful to Sauna Bar for significantly reducing my body aches and pains, helping me to feel functional again.  Twice a week I get a lymphatic massage and a personal infrared sauna pod to relax in.  You will want this after a pilates class, trust me.  The people here are so incredibly nice and invested in your program.  This place has become my little retreat during the day where I can be still and clear my mind... which has been a challenge for me lately.  Thank you Nikki, Dani, and Joseph!!<//Review>

I visited FBE during a trip to the LA area on the 4th of July Weekend (I'm from Detroit). I can honestly say that there is nothing like it here at home! I experienced the 10/20/30 workout with an infrared sauna session right before heading to the airport.

I train at a traditional chain gym with a regimen geared towards competitive powerlifting so as I went into the 10/20/30 workout I was a bit skeptical. Boy was I wrong! It was definitely challenging, but not to the point where I was completely worn out. It's too bad that we don't have helix lateral machines or whole body vibration machines in metro Detroit.

I finished off the workout with a relaxing session in the infrared sauna. I'm used to walking into a sauna that smells like socks and sweat at my gym, however, the sauna pod that I laid in was SUPER clean! The ambience of the sauna room was very relaxing. Nothing like the smelly, wooden "boxes" I'm used to.

Overall, if you're looking for a holistic work out experience from a long day at work (I run my own business so this was much needed) - FBE is the place to go. Make sure you also get a Body Composition Analysis! It really helped me understand my body fat percentages, weak points in terms of strength, and areas where I needed improvement.

The team is very friendly and VERY knowledgeable and I left not only relaxed and energized but with a lot of knowledge about holistic health and weight loss.< /Text>

<Text>I am a huge fan of the Magnesphere - as a massage therapist my arms and hands are always tight and after a magnesphere session I always feel much better and it relaxes my mind and balances my body  (the best healing nap ever!!!) - FYI: the Magnesphere also has a Bone Pain program for those who suffer from that horrible affliction - definitely recommended!!!   I also love the infrared sauna and vibration machines - Saunabar is part of my routine maintenance for my body and makes me feel rejuvenated week after week! Thank you Saunabar!</Text>< Pictures>

<text>A friend invited me to try out the 10/20/30 experience last Saturday, so I booked a spot and went to check it out. This hidden gem is so well done, sitting above Eddie's Barbershop in West Hollywood. The overall look of the place is so beautiful and clean. You feel like you're in a tucked away, private spa.

When I arrived Joseph took me on a tour of their facility and explained their various services- all designed to transform your body into its optimal shape, a healthy and holistic way. I love! They offer so many different services, I recommend checking out their list online, which also has helpful videos so you know what you're signing up for!

The first ten minutes of the 10/20/30 experience is on their helix lateral trainer. I'm athletic, I do yoga and I have a trainer. Literally 10-15 seconds on this machine and mama felt it! I was happy that I only had to do ten minutes, but I felt the burn and was happy I could do it! The next 20 minutes are spent on what I call the jiggle machine (the totally, not scientific name I've given it, but it's real name is the whole body vibration machine... See? Jiggle machine is more fun!). When I saw the video online I wasn't really sure how much I was going to feel anything from it bc it looks kind of silly. Again, wrong. It vibrates your whole body, which makes your muscles work double time. Each movement your trainer has you do isolates the target muscles and you feel it. More so than the workout, I thoroughly LOVED what it did for my circulation. Unfortunately I have poor blood flow, as evidenced by my spider veins that I've had since high school, but this machine is amazing at getting your blood flowing throughout your entire body. My body tingled and I felt giddy afterwards, not at all exhausted. The last part of the 10/20/30 experience is the infrared sauna part for thirty minutes. It was so relaxing I fell asleep pretty fast. The room is tranquil and soft mediation music plays as you lay inside this body pod that covers you in infrared light from your collarbone, down. As you lay inside the pod, fully clothed, you're relaxing on top of jade stones and soaking in the infrared, which help with detoxing, increasing your circulation and boosting your immune system. Joseph told me it also helps with pain and tension, which I noticed because I had slept funny a few nights prior and couldn't turn my head fully left without pain. 30 minutes in this machine and the pain in my back was gone, while my neck had more mobility. The best part about the sauna is that I sweat so much & got rid of so many toxins (I was out and about drinking with friends the night before), which gave my body the most incredible glow. Like Beyoncé-level glow. Yes- I'm that serious. And to boot, you burn 600 calories per sesh. I don't even know why you're still reading this- book a session. You can thank me later.</text>< Pics>

<rate>5</rate><date>1436161333101< /date><Pictures>None</Pictures><Text>FBE is truly a place that I am grateful for and am so happy that I live in a city that offers such a unique transformation spa.  I am from the Midwest and there is NOTHING like this out there.  I will share what I love about this place.  My favorite is the infrared sauna.  A friend of mine was able to recover and heal completely from an autoimmune disorder and he told me that part of his protocol was to SWEAT!  So, I did some research and found that infrared saunas provide the best, most effective platform for sweating and detoxing around. The wonderful staff there told me that the pods have both near and far infrared in them and that not too many other saunas offer this.  I wasn't sure exactly why that was important, but I later learned that essentially the dual rays go directly through the skin by a few inches deep, and heats up the body and detoxes from the inside-out.  Most dry saunas heat from the outside of the body with the high temperatures of air found there.  I always struggled to breathe about 10-15 minutes into a dry sauna and it almost made my lungs/throat burn with the high temperatures.  This is not the case here!  These pods allow easily for a 40 minute session, laying down, super comfortable and with the head popped outside of the unit.  I LOVE IT!  I take the time to meditate, think positively and relax in my session...as I am sweating, detoxing and also burning a good amount of calories with zero effort :)   I like the feeling of sweating out the toxins, especially since I have dealt with an uncommon illness over the last few years.  I have noticed a significant improvement in my health by regularly visiting these saunas a few times each week.  Also, I feel my skin has improved.  These also help with pain and inflammation, so if you have arthritis, bad back or any other injuries...this is definitely something you need to try.  Another thing I love about this place is the vibration machines.  It actually feels good to me to stand on them and just shake LOL!.  You can incorporate weights and make it a full body workout on the machines and it will target deep into muscles that are hard to reach.  They apparently are as effective as a 1-hour workout in just 20 minutes of shaking.  Awesome!  This place also offers a few other unique things like Lymphatic Massage, Magnesphere (Magnet therapy--cool concept), and a weightloss program.  I am starting the weightloss transformation this week and I am hopeful to shed some weight and also reset my body after a few months of abuse to my body eating poorly under a great deal of stress. I will come back and report my findings. If you haven't been here before to FBE, I highly encourage you to check it out.  I hope to never be without these infrared saunas for the rest of my life, they honestly have been that beneficial for me--I feel so much better after every session!< /Text>< GmapID>

This is definitely the Spa/Fitness Center of the 21st Century! Forget those other gyms, this is the future of working out and healing, in one fabulous place. I just had the full monty at FBE today. I did the 10/20/30 and experienced an aerobic challenge, then the Whole Body Vibration and the infrared sauna. Then I had a session on the Magnesphere-magnetic resonance therapy modality and all I can say is, "for the first time in ages, I feel high on life!" This is beyond any drug, it's all natural and it helps you to clear out the clutter in your brain, release the stress and tension and let go of the pain that we all have living in this modern, crazy world. Another great treatment is Lymphatic Compression Massage. It helps with swelling, and lymphatic drainage and is an excellent part of the detox treatment. There’s so much more to say about this but you have to make an appointment, go there to experience it yourself.This place is a hidden gem, Joseph, the owner is a genius, Jourdan at the front desk is a doll and Dr. Har Hari Khalsa will help you get healthy. This whole protocol is the best of the best in LA and beyond. Run, don't walk to this WeHo haven and sign up for it all, get a membership, just do it!< /text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>Been here since December and I'm so glad I gifted myself with this purchase.  I've been doing martial arts and all the cross training that compliments it, yoga, piloxing, kickboxing, boxing, hiking, running, cardio barre, pop physique etc. etc. etc., only to be at a stand still with my body for over 8 years.  Although I switched my routine, my body wasn't quite catching up although I was healthy as all get out.  I was taught what food was good for my body via a herbalogist and that did make some changes but nothing so big I was jumping up and down.  Then I went to FBE spa with a Gilt City voucher for one month of infrared jade sauna use which I was also doing at other places along with my workout but I wanted to see how it would work with an unlimited plan.  Decided to upgrade the purchase the first month and include full use of the gym...why didn't I do this for myself before?  First body scan, I was pretty strong and even, however I was about 10% over a normal body fat reading and I knew it was going to be rough getting rid of it.  4 months later, I've lost the 10% body fat and have gained 4lbs of lean muscle, my body type is being shaped to the body type I want and can see in the near future.  They put in front of me a 10/20/30 method that I bumped up immediately to 20/30/40 and yes I do work hard and push on every machine but not as often.  3x's a week along with 1-2x's a week of other activities if I chose to do so...it's a choice now, not a requirement and time is money!  I'm so close to the body I've wanted in as little as 4 months with my good eating habits.  Now grant it, I enjoy food...really enjoy food and I still give my body one full vegan treat cheat day and one full cheat meal which includes dairy if I want and my body is still changing for the good!  Couldn't have asked for better results and I'm now a loyal fan!  Expensive...yes, but you get what you pay for!<//text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>{'time': 1365439926710, 'text': "Thanks for the excellent rating, Leilani!

<Text>I would recommend Firm Body Evolution to ANYONE on the planet who wants to be fit and healthy in their bodies. I am a very active person who works out at the gym 5-6 days a week at a minimum of 90 minutes and yet I STILL had these “stored fat” trouble spots on my body which were difficult to burn. So a friend suggested that I try a weigh-loss program that target’s stored fat with the help of a homeopathic called “HCG” at Firm Body Evolution. I only had about 10 pounds that I wanted to loose but it was really about loosing the stored fat in certain stubborn areas of my body. After 10 weeks of the HCG diet program I lost my 10 pounds and my body also finally released the stubborn stored fat that was the bane of my existence.  When I started the diet I decided to try a “day pass” which included three sessions I like to call the “FBE Three”: 1. Whole Body Vibration (Shake it!)  2. Pneumatic Compression Body Massage (Squeeze it!)  3. Infrared Sauna (Sweat it!) and I saw instant results in terms of “shrinkage” and overall body tone.  So I decided to buy a package and returned to FBE for a few more “FBE Three” sessions and began to see DRAMATIC results not only the appearance of cellulite, overall toning and shrinkage but also my skin appearance had a healthier glow, my acne cleared up, my sleep had improved and my mental clarity was purified.  I can only attribute this to the intense amount of circulation that the body experiences with these incredibly advanced machines found exclusively at Firm Body Evolution.  So I decided to become a MEMBER and alongside of my normal fitness routine at the gym and eating a healthy whole and balanced diet- I am FINALLY the weight and shape that I was working so hard to achieve.  It was all made possible because of the advanced technology at FBE’s exclusive spa- from the machines, to the alkaline water, to the Body Composition Analysis machine I feel as if I am 100% knowledgeable about what’s going on inside my body so that I can see the results on the outside. Now whenever I book a role of TV or I am just looking for that detoxed slim feeling inside and out I know where to go: I am an FBE devotee for life!<//Text><user_name>Danielle Bisutti</user_name>< pictures>

We've been waiting at the gas station for our bicycle to be picked up. The servant was courteous and eager to assist me. He wished to work consistently and vigorously. Please acknowledge my heartfelt gratitude for taking the time to read it.< /text>

The gas station provides exceptional service; I receive prompt responses even on weekends and holidays. I'm astounded by how trustworthy their help is. The service fee is reasonable and, in my opinion, among the best in the world. Continue!!<//review>

The fact that your gas is pumped in and your windshield and rear window are washed is something I like about this gas station. They also ask if you want to have your oil tested! The best gas station in town!<//Text>

Got a $20 out of the ATM to wash my car, the clerk gave me change for a $10 ($5 bill and 5 singles) I noticed after turning around and immediately went back and explained I gave him a $20 from the ATM in the store and he held up a $10 Bill, the ATM doesn’t give $10 bills out. I don’t have time to argue about 10 bucks but either the ATM stole from me or the clerk did. Either way I’m not washing my truck here or getting gas again.<//text>

My family has been with Sunset Storage for nearly two decades. During which we've never had any problem, or complaint. The staff has always been polite & helpful. The rates are fare, and the quality of the units are excellent. If you want to keep your belongings safe, and not go broke over the price this is the place for you.< /Review>

The best storage you will find in the area.  Very friendly staff.  Very clean facility.  Great prices to start with but always offering specials to save you even more.  Units are insulated, doors well sealed, alarmed, and the drainage system keeps all water flowing away from units. Like storing your things in your own garage. Highly recommend for the safety of your valuables.<//review>

Have had a storage unit with Sunset Self Storage for years. Very happy with them. Even after moving to Kansas I have still continued to choose to do business with them. They had a unit available when my mother passed away and have been working with me to keep everything situated until I can come back out there to get the belongings we couldn't bring with us.

I will ALWAYS choose Sunset Self Storage if I need a storage unit. They have a very nice staff and very nice units.< /text>

Best place in town, two thumbs up. Place is very neat, clean and organized both on the outside and in. The staff is very friendly, kind and curtiouse. By far the best experience i have had with a storage company. You would have to be crazy not to use them for all your storage needs. If you want the best bang for your buck, there the place to go.< /Review>

Our family chose Sunset Storage because of there friendly staff and clean facility. I trust my valuables are safe and secure. I shopped around between Merced and Atwater before we chose Sunset Storage in Winton, and by far they had the best rates. We also rented a truck on site for $20 and bough boxes and tape. Anything and everything you need is there. It is one stop shopping when it comes to moving. I had to move some stuff with a very short notice and they were our last stop after shopping around all day and we knew this was the place I wanted to spend my hard earned $$$.  I was impressed they were open so late on a Saturday
Consider this business for all your moving needs!!!! Definitely... 5 stars.... And Thank you to all the staff for taking care of us..<//Text>

<Review>Mine and 5 other units were broken into, the thief's had enough time to go through 5 units worth of boxes and everything and clean me out of all my tools as well as other personal items about $6000 worth, as well as tote it all across a field to a parked car, all of this is due to the fact that the security systems they said they had in place were not properly maintained, owner doesn't care to make this right, take your business elsewhere where they value their customers!<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

Truly a fun experience. Atmosphere is great and Thursday night is family night with great specials. The servers are amazing and were accommodating to our large group. I strongly recommend the Planning Mill for great pizza and great drinks. Highly recommend, worth to try <3< /review>

<rating>3<//rating><text>We found this place on Yelp and it is such a cool building. The atmosphere is great but $35 for a 16" pizza is crazy, in my opinion. We ordered a medium pizza, small salad, a sandwich, and 2 drinks for $53. My husband loved his sandwich, Meatball Grinder, but the balsamic dressing for my Strawberry with Feta Salad was so potent that I asked for a different dressing which I was told it would cost extra. That was a bummer that they charge to replace the crummy dressing that came with it.  I really liked the crispy onions on the pizza but the smoked flavor was overwhelming, 1 piece was more than enough for me. I loved the building and ambience more than the food so I probably won't be back but who knows.<//text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNGcMINQCfPin0GXtDrfByE2RUItg7n55E8-ZDT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNRtjh-_xK16Y8pl8r5rKma3qqwH7Tj8dHfKK8S=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipODrHNTk1qZycwqxDljr_fZtbhwBoCYCEG7tSaD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP-L08hBmWB-s7GjXmbFynsGbUn2GgVYApeDyvU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMcf5UA08msrN5xQCE27zMZSuFnxHVP8OHvIHrd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM_yFQqQn7nt2K-7rY5TmWJHlq_dMXH6K1DFgfR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO0_Sab9RndS9jfEWPSj3gouWIbRLtQiisDaeZ8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP89B6bxkS2pxrAf-aS_pd9xLslRvkngjVJrWyj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP70eRZqIJDC-Okn12erJIJrlAkHDgCEEmkeDgX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMpsSAIIK6ffvvCI35xMPpc9D5CpkJozNbaMy9x=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN21dZH96eK7dA1u_pCGQ4Gk6r8jYDORktUlzct=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP2TBxetKpWfUYI0fQFb2-UL8o8n7Q6NuedPmq7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

<user>105806388504784669009</user><Review>I was so happy to try the Three Little Pigs.  I ordered it in medium and the pie comes with pulled pork, two kinds of beacon, red pepper, BBQ sauce and topped with onion strings.  I loved the pizza so much.  It is not a typical pie and I'm sure the rest of their pies on the menu are also amazing. Recommend< /Review>< pictures>

Maybe my experience is my fault for ordering outside of the "specialty" this establishment is known for, but so far, they are 0 for 3 on items that are not pizza.  I have ordered the red pulled pork sandwich (overcooked caramelized pulled pork) and yard bird (dry with no real flavor) sandwiches, as well as their garlic parmesan wings (soggy and floating in grease).  I do think the atmosphere is awesome, their building is super cool, and their staff have always been fantastic and friendly (which to be honest is a better combination than you'd find at most places), and is the only reason I rate them as high as I did</text>

There ordering system for sit down dining was a first for the wife and myself. I may be old fashioned but having to input my credit card information into a link that I'm not familiar with before even ordering isn't going to happen. And no one working there would stop by to help us understand the process. Luckily Stacked was just a couple of blocks away and there u actually talk to someone to take your order.< /review>

< Review>
I placed an online order on a Friday for a business meeting on Monday at 11:30 am. Got email confirmation.

Monday morning I showed up 15 minutes before my pickup time and the place is locked, closed without any sign to inform they are not open for the day. A produce delivery truck is sitting outside trying to get hold of somebody to complete the delivery. 6 guests walked away while I'm trying the only phone publicly available, getting voice-mail every time. My office is able to get hold of either the owner or a manager who informed they are closed because of a technical issue???? My co-workers and myself scrambled to get lunch for our meeting participants.

I made contact with this business when I got back to office. They only offered to reschedule the order which was pointless as the meeting was happening at the time. I requested to make sure my business card was refunded for online order.

As of today, Tuesday, I have not received a cancelation email, notification or anything regarding neither the cancelation of the order or the refund to my credit card.

Awful way to drop the ball, and I will avoid to patronize this business in the future IF my managers and supervisors give it it as an option to cater ot purchase food from.< /Review>

Giving 2 stars since they moved areas and now the nourishment doesn't taste the equivalent. This used to be the best pizza around the local area. Presently it possesses a flavor like a $5 prepared to go pizza yet at the same time has the costly cost. Anyway I should state the wings are entirely great simply baffled in the menu changes and how the pizza never again tastes anything like it used to.< /Text>

We went to the planing mill today and had the best time! We go often, mostly for the Thai wings. Christian always gives us the best service and he is one of the reasons we always come back. He is so polite and friendly and we just wanted to give him a shout out!< /Review>

<Review>This place is ideal only if you're eating as a couple at the bar. You can't hear anything even across the table so I would not recommend coming here with a large group.

Pizza and beer are better than average. Mozzarella sticks... not so great. My entire order of sticks were just crust without cheese.<//Review>< user_id>

The best food ! Great selection of beers on tap.
The people and service are always perfect . Always greeted with a smile and I always leave with a smile. The best social environment in Visalia. Always feel welcomed. Whether Having dinner with family or a friend or just stopping by to have a beer and watch the game. The Mill is the best . The food never disappoints.< /Text>

This pizza is so dang good! They also have really great sides. You can’t go wrong with any of them. The only downside is that it is pricey but I don’t mind supporting local business that is also just really delicious.</text>

Giving 2 stars since they moved areas and now the nourishment doesn't taste the equivalent. This used to be the best pizza around the local area. Presently it possesses a flavor like a $5 prepared to go pizza yet at the same time has the costly cost. Anyway I should state the wings are entirely great simply baffled in the menu changes and how the pizza never again tastes anything like it used to.<//review>

<text>I went to the Planing Mill today for lunch.  I got there about 1:45pm.  I looked through the menu and wanted to stay but the only other patrons were at the bar.  I change my mind and got a slice togo.  I took it to my car with a soda.  The Pizza was completely dried out.  The crust was hard on the bottom and thick and chewy in the middle.  The tip of the slice was pointing up.  The cheese was hard and completely dried out.  I returned to the Pizzeria and waited at the counter.  The cashier came back from the bar in a few minutes and I told her the Pizza was dried and old.  She went directly to the phone and started dialing.  She never looked at it or acknowledged anything.  I gave her back the Pizza and she said she was contacting her manager.  I decided just to leave.  She knew the pizza was old and dried up when she sold it to me.  Seriously $9.00 ($7.50 plus tip) for a slice that Costco ($1.50) would have thrown out.  More importantly they knew they gave me awful pizza and never apologized.  Don't bother there are plenty of good Pizzerias around don't support rotten service, I'm not the only one who have seen this.</text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOJB5dnwe3ktnZfdEA0BX0MeMHq1ghtnVmKRso8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><resp>{'time': 1544068365010, 'text': 'Hi Fred,\n\nWe are so deeply sorry to hear about your experience with us today.

<Text>The best food ! Great selection of beers on tap.
The people and service are always perfect . Always greeted with a smile and I always leave with a smile. The best social environment in Visalia. Always feel welcomed. Whether Having dinner with family or a friend or just stopping by to have a beer and watch the game. The Mill is the best . The food never disappoints.< /Text>< Rating>

This pizza is so dang good! They also have really great sides. You can’t go wrong with any of them. The only downside is that it is pricey but I don’t mind supporting local business that is also just really delicious.< /text>

Don’t know why people at complaining about. I’ve lived in Visalia and never tried this place. The pizza was excellent and the staff are very friendly. The wings are great as well. I enjoyed that the pizza was crisp and that the toppings don’t just fall off of the pizza slices. The were quick and prompt. Will be returning with my daughter hopefully soon. Thank you for the glove of ice for my daughters hand after she pinched her knuckle with the rest room door. The atmosphere outside would be nice for a visit during the late night hours.</review>

Went there to try this place as we had heard it was good. Asked to be seated for 2. She said it's going to be 30 or 40 minutes for that. This was at 5:45 PM. Open tables visible, one family waiting to be seated. I told the smug hostess that we will go elsewhere. Didn't need to try the food to know we would never be back.</text>

<text>Clean place with good food. You seat yourself and order at the counter when you're ready to order. Lots of seating if you're thinking of bringing a lot of people and a wheelchair could fit at the end of the table if need be. They have highchairs for babies too. They have a small bar in one corner but it's a healthy atmosphere and a good place for families. The staff was polite.</text><name>Emily</name><rate>4<//rate>< Pictures>

<text>h... Price is way high for what you get. Pizza flavor is nothing to write home but the sauce is ok with a little spice. Crust is doughy which is good. The toppings were not high quality as the pepperoni was very thin and the onions were cut thin as well. We got the Thursday night special for $29.99 including a large 3 topping pizza and an appetizer. But with that special you can only get certain appetizers. I don’t like to be nickel and dimed. Either it’s a special or it isn’t. In the end, the special saved me $1.01... not really a special. Oh well. Probably won’t come back. Hostess was pleasant and server was great. The pizza was a $10 pizza and the appetizers were good but for $8, it wasn’t worth it.</text>< pictures>

<Text>First time going to the new location and it was extremely nice. Hard to find at first especially when you are driving. But now I know where to go. Love the outdoor area. Very clean family friendly atmosphere. Bathrooms were clean and well stocked good thing because the place got super busy around 5ish. Even with them being busy, our waitress was amazing. The pizza turned out just as great as I remember them being. We ordered a large Thai Pie... One of the best ones on the menu. Beer selection was good and came out nice a cold. Will definitely be going back if I end up on that side of town again.<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

We were headed home after a glorious 4-day backpacking trip, craving pizza. A quick Google Maps search found The Planning Mill just a tiny bit off our path. Good pizza, a great selection of beers and quick service made for a quick satisfying meal!

If are ever nearby looking for a tasty bite to eat, you can't go wrong with The Planning Mill.<//Review>

The pizza here was great. It's a little pricey, but well worth it. I went on my lunch break. They have certain pizzas available by the slice for $5, the slices are huge. I'd definitely go again.<//Review>

Horrible service. We were told it would be 45 minute wait to be seated. So we said we would wait in the bar and order an appetizer. The hostess stated “you can’t have your name on waiting list and order an appetizer. I will have to remove you from the list”. Either this is a really bad policy or just a really bad hostess. We were just hungry and after all it is a restaurant. We left but had great appetizer and meal in Exeter.<//review>

Pizza was delicious. Great, fun toppings (kettle potato chips?!) Lots of good non-pizza options too. The hidden gem is the well-curated beer list with tons of local and regional quality beers. Kids were definitely welcome.< /Text>

<Text>tried to make reservations for a large group well in advance only to be told they don’t take reservations. They were rude and extremely unhelpful. This is the third time I have have poor service at the Planing Mill. I have gone back because because I think it’s important to give businesses a second chance. But we have been going to this place loyalty since they opened and I guess I expected a little better out of them.

It will be a long time Before I try Planing Mill again. Also, maybe they should rethink their no reservations policy. Clearly they don’t need our business!

The business manger was less than helpful saying they, as staff, have no control over the owners policies. I totally get that!!!! But they don’t have to be rude and provide poor service.

Perhaps the owners should take. Little
More interest in what is happening at their business and consider reevaluating their “no reservations” policy!

We have been faithful customers who have enjoyed Planing Mill since it first opened at its old location. It seems they have gotten a little too big for their britches!< /Text>< rate>

Food was great, service was trash. I don't know what the issue was or why they were so terrible. The waiter legit tried to blame one level of his incompetence on them "baking" Dana's cookies for 30 minutes.</review>

<review>Went here with a group of 10. The hostess was nice and friendly. We didn't have much if a wait but it was a Wednesday evening and there were graduation groups eating there at the time.
SERVICE: The service was pretty good. She took our drink orders right away and we got the drinks quickly. My complaint here is that the server didn't come back after we got our drinks to ask about refills on our beers or sodas.
FOOD: The food was great too. I made a custom pizza and about half of our table got personal pizzas while the rest got a salad or sandwich. No complaints from the others in my group about their food. I tried a few of the other items that my family had. The meatball sandwich was good but lacked the flavor to make it great. The 3 pig pizza with onion straws on it was just too much stuff on one pizza and was difficult to eat. Flavor wise it was pretty good though.
One of my other complaints is the open layout coupled with the concrete floor makes it very loud and hard to hear people across the table. I'd go back though and try some of the other dishes on the menu. Maybe try to go back when it's not as busy though or at on of the outdoor tables.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x80952f7a594ffb55:0x3e88a089ccbf3b5a< /gmapID></record>

Great pizza! The unique flavors and styles make it hard to choose which pizza you want! They have a great atmosphere, nice patio, and cool bar. I would definitely recommend!< /review>

Our original waiter was extrememly wonderful and provided awesome service. The pizza was better than expected and I felt I got what I payed for. We received a new waitress because the original had to go on break. When it came to paying, she forced my card into paying her a tip. My price that I was given was $48. Once I signed and everything on the tablet, she quickly took it in hopes I wouldn't see she charged me more (I assume). We broke a $20 bill before to give a tip, but didn't since she tried to be sneaky. This was my first time coming here, so I'll give this place a second thought when it comes to eating somewhere. Other than that, it was great.

Edit: I don't know who the waitress was other than she had short hair and wore a red shirt and hat. There was NO confusion on the paying option. She never gave me the option to give a tip. She went through the tablet and handed it to me to sign my name and input my email. That was it. I don't know how to respond to the owner's, so I'm editing this, hoping they see. This occurred tonight 11/3/18.< /text>

I had a lot of good times at this place. It was my hub for socializing in a town I was not familiar with.

The beer selection is great. Always rotating. Expect something different with each visit. And the prices are fair. Especially during happy hour!

The food is top notch in the area. It ain't just good artisan pizza.. they've got delicious sandwiches, salads, wings, etc.

The staff is also very nice and hospitable.<//text>

<text>Really like/love this place...if I could give it 4.5 I would. The staff is nice, the atmosphere is fun, the drinks/taps are local and tasty, and the food is good. Pizza crust is okay IMO, and a couple apps are good, but not exceptional. Overall I love just hanging out here with friends, or using the LARGE side room for meetings. (It is loud in there for parties due to the concrete floors though.)<//text><time>1526516519152< /time>< username>

The issue as noted in my wife's complaint is not who made a mistake, you or us. In fact, your response to my wife's concern is simply further proof that your company employees would benefit from further training in customer service. We live in a small community where business reputation and customer loyalty should be your #1 priority. We've ordered pizza from you 3-4 times in the last 2 months and we both know your pizza is marked up probably 300% on the cost of ingredients. We don't even get cheese on our pizza and it costs $34.49. We understand you have employees and bills to pay and that's why we were choosing to patronize your local restaurant. But in this event of either an honest mistake or a computer glitch... you still make us pay the full price of a pizza we ended up donating to the homeless folks at Oval Park. Well then yes, we are dissatisfied customers who get to leave a review. We plan to be in this community for the next 30 years and had this issue been resolved differently, you could have had our business. I honestly can't believe you replied to her review by saying it was her fault... do you realize how many possible other variables could have gone wrong between her order and your fulfillment of that order? Your mission is "To deliver an exceptional guest experience... with a focus on genuine guest service." Well, you failed last night. Best wishes to the owners of your restaurant in their future endeavors. They've lost out on what could have been long-term valued customers and a lot of customer referrals.< /Review>

The Manager turned away a huge group on Tuesday 3/10. Their loss. Refused to make a giant pizza for a kids party. Had called and was told all we needed to do is call 1 hr before to order. When we called to order the Manager refused to help us out.  Was planning my birthday there next week but will now look for a different place.</Review>

Went on a Saturday afternoon during the Pliny the Younger release. A very welcoming, spacious place to hang with friends over some beers or with the family hanging outdoors with games to play. The owner, Tim, is always gracious and his staff are very nice. I ordered a medium Evil Pie pizza. It consisted of chorizo, linguica, pepperoni, garlic, pepperoncini, peppers, ricotta, serrano peppers, green onion and cholula sauce. Very delicious. Overall, I highly recommend coming here.< /Text>

I wish I had some fancy words, but I'm a simple man with good taste and I don't have time to use a thesaurus right now. Point is, this place is good. A laid back atmosphere with a varied selection of quality beers on tap. The pizza is tasty and well made with fresh ingredients. It's good for friends or for family, or both if you're friends with your family. Go eat there.</text>

The worst service.  Called it in to pick up and when I got there to pick up they did not have record of it and had to order there and wait another 25 minutes.  Got a basic house salad and mushrooms and it was 22.00 which I think they overcharged me and then I did not get dressing for my salad.  Never going back.  Terrible place</Text>

<Review>Some of the best pizza I had in a long time. Wonderful family environment. Wings we're amazing I could buy a order now they were so yummy. Being I've moved away from that area I can't wait to go back and visit because eating here is on the Todo list.

If I could give less than 1 star I would. I am incredibly disappointed with the service I received from your employees. I was planning on hosting an event at your establishment, and called to reserve a day. I was told over the phone by your party reservation manager that I could reserve the time, but a payment would be required at least 2 weeks before the party day so we reserved the time. I then sent out invitations with the time and location of Planing Mill. I came in 2 weeks and 3 days before the party to pay for the reservation, and then was told that my reservation didn’t exists and the time I was told was reserved for my party, was no longer available. The party reservation employee then said that the party reservations are first come first serve, and a payment is required to reserve the room. This is completely different than what the previous employee had told me, and now I’m left without a venue for my party just 2 weeks before. Your employees shuffled me from employee to employee, and disregarded my concern and the fact that I was told my reservation was made, when it was not. The unorganized and undedicated conduct of your employees is rude, inconsiderate, and unprofessional. This is extremely disappointing and I would greatly appreciate this issue resolved.< /text>

{'time': 1542516257850, 'text': 'Hi Alexandria,\n\nWe would first like to sincerely apologize for your frustrations. Our reservation policy is always the same. Reservations are made on a first come, first served basis. We never hold a reservation date without payment and our contract signed first. Reservations must be made and paid for at least two weeks prior to the date for staffing and scheduling reasons but can always be made anytime before that, as we recommend coming in to do so as soon as possible. We do have a later time slot available on the date you requested. Please email us at contact@planingmillpizza.com to speak to our head manager.'}</Response>

Decent pizza (we shared a medium Thai pie) - it's not Neapolitan style but not to thick either. Wide range of beers on draft - it was fun to have one from Fort Collins Street many years.< /text>

<review>Very first time here, my boyfriend brought me here as a date and it was actually fun and cool. We ordered and sat down and was waiting for our food. The only bad thing about this place was the wait time. We had to wait 23 minutes but maybe that's because they were busy and about to close.< /review>< Resp>

Great pizza. But as I sit in this nice new restaurant I can’t help but say “Please God get more seating”. You waste so much room with the giant round tables, and sit a family of 4 there, only to have an hour and a half wait on a Thursday.

Five stars if I can eat here without having to wait so long. Third visit in a row with this long a wait. Please do something with the seating arrangement.  I’m sitting here watching people turn around and leave after they hear the wait time. You’re losing money.</Text>

A completely different pizza place. The enterance was amazing and thought it was a restaurant. Inside it's nicely decorated but too dark. I think there needs to be more booths. The pizza was okay, I would have to try again to make sure. I'd give it a 7/10 cause the pizza was greezy. maybe a 8/10 when I try again.< /review>

Unfortunately pizza was a disappointment. The margarita pizza had thick crust and was flavorless. Pepperoni Pizza was the same, flavorless 😢. Our server kept putting his back to my husband while he was helping the other guess at the next table. It’s kind of hard to eat when someone keeps putting their rear in your face when they have an option to stand to the side and excuse themselves while they are at it. Management really needs to have a staff meeting to enforce sanitary precautions. The cooks have beards without beard guards and we noticed cooks were touching their face while cooking. A plus is they have corn hole on the front patio.< /Review>< Resp>

Know that the food is slow. Because this is hand done pizza, expect to spend some time here and bring something to entertain small ones while you enjoy a craft beer before hand. Be aware of busy nights (Friday, Saturday, Game Day) and make plans accordingly. The pizza is great. The staff WILL remember you if you are/become a regular and they do great beer nights. Come and enjoy Visalia's small Business of the Year 2017 and the good food.<//Text>

It was my first time going here and it was great. The scenery is amazing. You could take alot of good pictures. The pizza is amazing. A cool thing about that place is they have a variety of pizza toppings. They have a contest with eight people who finish a huge pizza. If you win you don't have to pay for it.<//Text>

<Review>I read the reviews and expected good pizza. However, I was really surprised at how mediocre the pizza really was. Not a Little Cesar quality mind you but not much better. What it really lacked in was any flavor. The dough was lacking in flavor and the sauce was lacking in flavor. I asked to have the creamy Alfredo mixed with the pesto to give it more flavor but was told they could not do that. Considering I spent just under $100 for three pizzas, I don't expect to ever go back again.<//Review>< pics>

<Text>My family members are regulars here. We typically come once every 1-2 weeks for carry out and occasionally dinning in. The pizza can be a bit pricey, but we typically come for the special which makes price about the same as most pizza places. The Planing Mill has way better quality ingredients. Stellar Pizza. Tip: On a nice day it's fun to sit outside and play corn hole.<//Text>< gmapID>

The Planing Mill is a great place to get some good food and cold brews. Great selection of craft beer to pair with the delicious pizzas and sandwiches. The atmosphere and decor is really awesome. Hang with your friends on the patio outside and play corn hole.<//Text>

< Review>
I love this place! Their pizza is some of the best I've had outside of NY and the toppings combinations are pretty great. Their various appetizers are also quite good (I recommend the wings and drunken mushrooms). In addition to all the great food they serve, they also have a pretty nice, albeit a little small, craft beer bar. With up to a dozen beers that rotate out every few days, there's always something new to try. If you're in the Visalia area and looking for something to eat, you can't go wrong stopping by here.< /Review>

Maybe to drink beer on a weekend or something, but there are plenty of places to find good beer now. For pizza, the joint we all know at Main and Church is the STUFF. With a large group I might pick TPM first, but a dozen people on the porch at PK is no problem. Good, but I don't know when I'll go back.< /review>< user>

<Resp>None< /Resp><text>We read the reviews, and were enthusiastic about trying out The Planing Mill.  The reality didn't meet the hype.  I've waited a couple months to post this review: I think it's better to praise than scold, and restaurants are kind of subjective.  That said, the service was inattentive, slow, and confusing.  There is a bathroom, but it is located outside the building, and was a mess.  We were told Internet access was only for the staff.  Altogether, we couldn't wait to get on our way, and so, when our meals came, we were in no mood to enjoy them.  My wife asked about getting the remainder of her meal wrapped, and our waitress showed so little enthusiasm that we just got up and left.  I hope your experience is better.< /text><userid>118173435922589331296</userid><rating>2<//rating><gmapID>0x80952f7a594ffb55:0x3e88a089ccbf3b5a</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Order prepared incorrectly. Pizza's brought to the table 20mins apart. Manager was rude and lied to cover up the cooks mistake. No offer from the manager to correct the many mistakes. They refused to have the owner contact us. Eaten here several time but never again...< /Text>

It's would've been 5 starts but they removed my favorite pizza in the works: carne asada pizza. Really great food n beers, usually great service as long as it's Cheyanne, she's really great.< /review>

Sat outside with artichoke fritters and a small Funky Chicken pizza, which was perfect for two people. The fritters were not chunks of artichoke, but ground up, battered and fried then served with a spicy, creamy dipping sauce.</review>

The pizza did not stand out as very incredible. The topping were sparse. The taste was bland. It was cooked perfectly.
The bar has an excellent section of craft beer. The service is lacking. No one checked on our party while I was there but once to ask if we wanted a to go box.<//review>

<Text>Rudest people I've met in my life. They screw up my order, make me pay full price & wont do anything to rectify. RUN!

Response to Planing Mill: I'm so glad that you all finally found your manners. I'm disappointed it required a public forum in order for you to conjure some up. The Grubhub guy put your employee on speaker phone so I heard for myself just how RUDE she was. Your lack of customer loyalty (& manners) for a pizza you no doubt mark up 300% is jarring. You'd rather lose my business entirely (& yes I will relay my experience to everyone I know in Visalia) than fix the issue.<//Text><UserId.>112705103331762655879< /UserId.><Rating>1< /Rating>< time>

Great little pizza spot! I don't visit Visalia very often, but I'll definitely be back. It's tucked in a random little spot. Super rustic and fun. They have an outdoor patio. When I was there, they had a bunch of Mead on tap. My wife loved it. I had an Imperial IPA from Tulare (don't remember the company,  unfortunately) - just wanted to try it... but it was really good!! This place has standards. Everyone in my party had pizza and really liked it. Service was fast and friendly. Only minor complaint would be that they only serve beer and wine... My wife just happened to want a cocktail. She was happy with the mead though! The price was really good, too!</text>

Unhappy with the treatment by your staff. I am a part of your loyalty program and wished to use my coupon towards my purchases. However, I was rudely denied this opportunity by your Manager (Alex? The lady that works the bar) after other staff had approved my usage. I was not informed that I was unable to use this prior to my ordering the daily special and instead of accommodating the Manager basically told me tough luck there is nothing I can do and then wanted to reprimand my server right in front of me, how embarrassing! How about a little better communication upon your staff and and an apologetic response.  Don't think I will be back.< /Text>< pictures>

< review>
I went this afternoon with some friends.  I have been to the Planing Mill before and have always had wonderful food, and no issues with service before today.  My friends and I each ordered personal pizzas and drinks.  I ordered the Muscles from Brussels, with no bacon.  I had been planning on ordering this pizza since we decided where we would be having lunch.  It sounded awesome, and I have heard that Mike's Hot Honey is amazing. Unfortunately, when my pizza arrived, I was told that they were out of the honey.  I was visibly disappointed and told our server that the only reason I ordered that pizza was because of the honey.  She was incredibly polite and apologized, and I appreciate that, but I wish that I had been told before hand that they were out of the honey.  I 100% would have ordered a different pizza.  That particular pizza has only 6 toppings and now I'm down 2.  The server offered to bring me a different sauce on the side, but I wasn't sure what to order.  She suggested the aioli that is typically paired with the appetizers.  I don't know that that was the right choice.  As I said, the server was very sweet, and very apologetic, my issue is that I felt like I was being offered a substutution for an ingredient, but there was no offer to "make it right" or make sure I was satisfied with what I got.  Other establishments would have offered a replacement, or perhaps a discount on my next visit, something....  But that was not the case.  Additionally, when we went to the bar, we were interested in trying the Mexican lager that was on the $2 Taco Tuesday special, but the bartender wasn't happy with the way it was pouring, so we were offered a different beer, at the same price.  The second beer wasn't as good, but for $2 it was a decent replacement.  This was the offer to make it right that I had hoped for with the pizza.  I will definitely be back, but I will be sure to ask if all the ingredients are available before I order my pizza.< /review>

We were told it would be 45 min and after an hour and twenty min they said they had seating but were behind in the kitchen. Wth.  Don't go with kids bc if you are on the waiting list they won't even allow you to order French fries while you wait the ridiculous amount of time it takes to get a table.  We ordered 6 drinks and still wouldn't let us order apps!  Won't be going back!</review>

Wanted to let you all know this lovely group came in at peak time on an extremely busy Friday night, tried to jump the waitlist because their kids were hungry (nobody else waiting was hungry, apparently), and when they couldn’t get their way, went to the bar area and started hurling bigoted slurs to our staff. They were asked to leave and certainly won’t be welcomed back. We will never tolerate abuse of our staff.'}< /response><Gmap_id>0x80952f7a594ffb55:0x3e88a089ccbf3b5a< /Gmap_id></record>

<Review>Don't know how it is, after checking their website to make sure it was open on a Sunday afternoon, we drove from Lemoore, 29 miles, to take my granddaughter out to pizza to celebrate her birthday along with 20 other family and friends. When we get there, we're informed they are closed for a private party.
Very unprofessional, should have posted that on their website. 10-15 other people were turned away also in the 5 minutes we were there. Staff didn't seem to really care.< /Review>< pics>

Parking at the new location is terrible. Food has become mediocre. It seems as time has passed, so has their desire to bring the quality ingredients they used to offer. And though the food taste cheaper, the prices have remained the same. I still come back from time to time hoping they'll once again go back to making pizza they way they did a few years back.< /text>

Tasty pizza but the service wasnt so hot. We ordered two medium pizzas for two adults and three kids. When the kids pizzas came out we assumed the next one would be right out. However, it didn't and when we asked for the status of the second pizza the server sounded surprised we needed another pizza. Once the mistake was noticed, I would've assumed the second pizza would've been put on a fast track but the second pizza took even longer than the first. Both were really good but I preferred the simpler cheese and pepperoni and the flavorful sauce really shined.

It may have been an especially bad day but with pizzas these good (and the beer selection!) we'll definitely go back.< /review>

<Text>Good food but things keep changing. Went the week of Valentine's day and was told you could call ahead to get on the list for a table (couldn't before), and went again last week (a few weeks later) and that wasn't the case anymore. Beer selection varies and they don't always have what they advertise.</Text>< pics>

<Review>Don't be ashamed to order a small pie, for they are heavy and huge, and full of taste. I ordered a roasted red bell pepper/artichoke/Italian sausage small pizza, and it fed me for several meals. Great customer service. A bit pricey, but worth EVERY penny!<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

This was our first time in this restaurant and we had the Thai Pie and a Chipotle Chicken sandwich. The food was awsome and the staff was very friendly and helpful.

Not very many beers to choose from but as for the food...! Omg, I recommend the Muscles from Brussels! Spicy, crispy, yummy! For apps we got bruchetta, delicious, yet hard to make bad, and Thai boneless chicken wings (1/2 off all Boneless Wings on Mondays...$6 😍 for a lb!). We split a Greek Salad, so good, then ordered 2 $5 Brussel Sprout apps to snack on while we finished our beers! Make sure to shake some parm on those brussles...very generously may I say! Gave 4 stars cuz of the small  beer selection or I would have given 5 stars all day! Love the new building!<//review>

<Review>Tried dining in on a not so busy night (so you'd think they would want the business) but nope the hipster guy working the front said they were closed (we came at 8:55). If your sign says open until 9 then you should be! Couldn't even get a beer. I'll be finding a new pizza place.< /Review>< Pictures>

Good, solid Mexican food.

Ordered the carnitas burrito & my wife had the veggie burrito.   Both came out quick and fresh.   Chips and salsa are fresh and tasty.

Carnitas is the perfect juicy, savory, texture and flavor, well shredded.  Every bite has a good blend of everything.

Really good place, especially if you aren't into Chipotle.  MUCH more authentic.</Text>

< review>
Got the three little pigs in personal size. Hardly any cheese, and dry meat. My boyfriend got the Calzone and it was mostly dough. Literally 15 minutes after eating we both felt sick. We were the only table there and the waitress wasn't checking up on us. Not worth the price either.</review>

Our Manager on duty tonight did explain to your husband that unfortunately, because the order you placed and received from GrubHub was not an error made on our part, but was an error acknowledged on your behalf, we would not be able to provide an additional order free of charge. We did however, attempt to extend an offer for a discount should you want to order again. We apologize if this fell short of your expectations.'}< /Response>< user_name>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) You can eat American style pizza. The feature is that the pizza dough has a firm volume. It is recommended to go with a large number of people and share various kinds of pizzas.
You can put the pizza you didn't eat out in a box and take it home.
There are many types of beer.
There is also a drink bar, so even people who can not drink alcohol can enjoy it.
There is no parking lot at the store, so basically we recommend that you park on the street around the store or use Uber or a taxi.

アメリカンスタイルのピザが食べられます。ピザ生地がしっかりとボリュームがあるのが特徴です。大人数で行っていろいろな種類のピザをシェアするのがオススメです。
食べきれなかったピザは箱に入れて持ち帰ることが出来ます。
ビールの種類も充実しています。
ドリンクバーもあるので、アルコールが飲めない人でも楽しむことが出来ます。
店の駐車場は無いので、基本は店の周辺の道路に路上駐車をするか、Uberやタクシーを使うことをオススメします。<//Review>
