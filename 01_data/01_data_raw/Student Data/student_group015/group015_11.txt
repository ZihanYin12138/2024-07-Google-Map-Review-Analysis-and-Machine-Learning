<Review>Loved having this place as my go to nail salon to keep up on fills. With the schedule I have, they are the best at getting in more last minute appointment spots. They're a fast paced, affordable shop that I've done all sorts of designs and shape changes and they all come out pretty and outlasting. Everyone's always meant well to me, even if they aren't the kind to be socializing to make clients feel good. Would like to give 5 stars and keep up on coming back, but sadly, most of the guys I've gotten have become rough in their work, with this last time ending up giving me blisters with their cuts and scrape burns/wounds.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Rate>3< /Rate>< time>

<Review>I have gone to this nail salon for years. Normally they have been really good and I have not had any issues with my nails or any of the techs there. Recently I have been given to the tech who works in the back right single desk and he has rushed and made a lot of mistakes that I had to file away once I got home. He doesn't use the liquid stuff on the back on the real nails like the others do and maybe that is why they lift the next day and chip away. After he does my nails within the first week they look like I have had them on for over the 2 weeks I normally go. I'm not the kind of person to make a big scene at the salon and was trying to just request another tech each time however this last time I started with someone who usually does a great job but then mid file was given to the tech who rushes. I will be finding another nail salon going forward as there are only about 2-3 techs there that take there time and do an awesome job but they are usually busy. I pay between $40-$60 or more when I get my nails and some times toes done and I usually have to re file my nails and again they lift after he does them. The other techs are really nice however this guy is usually more concerned about going fast.<//Review></record>

< Review>
First time going here and getting a manicure and pedicure. First nail salon in town that has done an amazing job on my nails. I went with a friend, and she has her own person she typically sees, however, she was willing to take me here than her usual. This is the first time since getting my nails done in town that I was a hundred percent happy and satisfied with the results. I am not one to get my nails done regularly, but this will be my 'go to' spot whenever I am home visiting. I truly appreciate the fact that both the male nail technicians were patient and friendly.< /Review>

<text>Got my nails done yesterday (5/4/21)  not happy with how they were done or how they turned out. One of the men did my nails I was in for a fill and he drilled I hard and fast it was hot. Then when he was buffing my natural nail he had to much pressure and speed on the drill he drilled all the way through my natural nail to the skin down by the cuticle.then he applied the acrylic and did not blend them well. Then when he was smoothing them out with the drill he cut both my middle fingers. Not to mention they are not the same shape or size and there is acrylic on my skin. I'm sad this happened because one of the women did my first set two weeks ago and I loved them and they turned out just how I wanted. I don't think I'll be returning.</text>< pics>

The price online was $20 for acrylic fill and polish, charged $30. Tech was not paying attention to my nails, cut me, nails uneven, not the same length and still had natural nails lifting underneath even after he drilled. While filling the tech was looking away and totally missing my nails at times.  This was my first time here and probably my last. I might try again but will not work with the gentleman in the back. He even commented that his customers were saying their nails were uneven all day. Even knowing this he still made no attempt to improve. Unfortunate as the salon looks like they have a lot of services to offer. Maybe I got someone on a bad day.< /text>

Went in, had an appointment.
Had walk ins come in after we checked in and they got helped 1st.
Had one lady who worked there tell us 1 time it would only be a few minutes.. ok fine.. was a Saturday afternoon, busy, I understand. We (husband and I) sat there for almost 30 minutes after our appointment time,  before walking out.
Had 3 guys walk past us that worked there and didn't say anything to us.</Text>

i know this nail place is right by the mall and it’s really convenient to go to in redding, but it’s really not worth it.

i wouldve put 1 star but the pedicure made up for it.</Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMEqaBHDx5QNU3AuiAW5jUR_HgSM3XGnhCiQLoJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMRA_5ebBTeYcDFiJ_h32mIHzX-znh-5juMyX0D=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><Resp>{'time': 1606090509849, 'text': 'Dear Raya, thanks for sharing your feedback.

I had asked for an ombré fill which I didn’t get. I cannot express how disappointed I am with the quality of my nails and how they turned out. I had even showed the guy a picture of what I wanted and it does not even look similar at all. I had set up an appointment the day of and it seemed as if the guy was rushing on my nails the whole time. I would not recommend this nail salon it is a waste of your money. I will now have to pay extra to get my ombré nails somewhere else because of this very reason.<//text>

Worst nail experience I’ve ever had! He did my nails in 15 minutes when it usually takes 45 to do a decent job... my blue has specks of white, there’s bubbles in the polish,you can see the paint lines he told me they were dry and then I went to get my card out of my purse and the nail polish came completely off my thumb, he repainted it and told me to go so the nail polish came off again getting in my car 🙄 they did okay on my pedicure before but I don’t recommend getting acrylics there. I could of done better at home< /review>

< review>
Johnny does a good job. Although has skipped the entire step of cuticle oil on my cuticles (he applied it at first). Always in and out in a half hour. The only thing i don't like about the entire shop is they're not real personable people. I've also gotten my nails done with Kaylee, which she does good also, but does not say "Hello, how are you, etc". When she was finished she just stood up and walk to the backroom. I thought, "ok, i guess im done". Johnny never says "Hi, how have you been", either. I was in the beauty industry for 20 yrs & I'm used to making my customer feel comfortable & welcome. They are all Asian, so they ALL talk in their language to each other, which most of the time makes you feel like maybe they are talking about you or other customers in the shop. I like getting my nails done with Johnny, but when you have gone to this shop for quite some time now, i wish i felt (and other people I know that go there) more comfortable!!<//review>

<review>Probably the worst costumer service that I’ve ever experienced at a beauty shop. Defiantly wouldn’t
recommend anyone to go here. Johnny or John?  is rude, doesn’t take his time and doesn’t say thank you when you tip.< /review><user_id>115098018457555022353< /user_id><date>1595278852733<//date>< resp>

<rate>4< /rate><review>The only reason I don't give Bellas 5 stars is because the last time I got my nails filled is due to 1 nail tech.  He did my full and upon further examination of my nails after I got home I noticed what a horrible job he did on them.  They were lumpy and not smooth.  I've gone to Bella's for years and this has never happened.  But I will be requesting my nail tech in the future.</review>< pics>

<text>Worst nail experience I’ve ever had! He did my nails in 15 minutes when it usually takes 45 to do a decent job... my blue has specks of white, there’s bubbles in the polish,you can see the paint lines he told me they were dry and then I went to get my card out of my purse and the nail polish came completely off my thumb, he repainted it and told me to go so the nail polish came off again getting in my car 🙄 they did okay on my pedicure before but I don’t recommend getting acrylics there. I could of done better at home<//text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPm4GnzFqxUMt2kTpi0v06YoHJxIw9EVRbX_uaa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< Response>

My nails turned out good but the man that did my nails was very unfriendly, barely spoke to me or responded when I asked a question. He acted annoyed to be doing my nails at all. I felt very uncomfortable the entire visit. Unlikely I'll go back.<//Review>

<Text>Ken did a great job on my dip powder manicure. I also got a regular pedicure and had a really good massage. My reason for 4 instead of 5 stars was the salon was dirty and seemed a little run down. It was constantly busy though (always a good sign), but they should have someone in charge of cleaning/sterilizing if there is that much turnover.< /Text>< pictures>

<text>I went to this salon today and it was busy.  I have been getting my nails done for years and have been to many salons.  This was hands down the worst gel fill I have ever gotten.  It took only 17 minutes for the man to give me a complete fill and gel polish.  Within 3 hours,  both of my thumbs have started to peel off.  I left with polish all over my skin.  It was horrible.  I'd give a zero for the rating if I could!<//text><resp>None< /resp><user_id>113601510531096097755</user_id></record></dataset><record>

I was referred by a friend to this place and told to ask for Johnny. I scheduled an appointment for 145 we got there a bit early and they got us in right away which was a plus but it wasn’t with the person I asked for when scheduling my appointment and the guy who did my nails was watching a basketball game on his phone while doing my nails. This was my first time getting acrylic nails, but I know they are supposed to be consistent in shape and length which mine are not. For the price I think they should’ve been done a bit better but oh well lesson learned. I will not be going there again.< /review>

Always a great job and always professional!  Prices are comparable to other shops and Bella Nails is the only one I know of that sometimes offers deals! The only time I felt as though I didn't receive the best service, I mentioned it to the owner and she took care of it for me!  Her customers satisfaction is her main priority! Check them out!<//review>

<text>Took my 14yo there for her first set of nails. We had an appointment and still waited over 20 minutes. (Not a huge deal) after leaving my 14yo told me she didn't like it. The nail tech only said 2 things to her the whole service (telling her she's tense and that she has 'baby hands') Added to everythimg else, 2 nails popped off less than a week later (popped off, no damage to the nail bed so they didn't get pulled off). It was cheap but I'd rather pay a little more and have a better experience.<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

I scheduled an appointment for 9am and I even got text/email notifications confirming the appointment but no one was there at 9am so I went elsewhere.</Review>

I only gave them 4 stars because the ombré acrylic nails I had done were done too quickly therefore you can see a harsh white line where they applied the white acrylic. I still liked the service but $40 for ombré was a little much for me.< /Text>

< Review>
Rude. All around unpleasant. I walked in for a simple full acrylic set ($26 on their menu) 'Tim' didn't speak one word to me through the whole experience, but he spoke to the women around me while they were getting their nails done. Every time I pointed out a concern with my nail he'd tell me not to worry, it would be filed out....I'm a paying customer, if my nails aren't even you should be understanding and fix the issue. Instead no matter how many times I said 'oh...the acrylic doesn't completely cover this nail' or 'are you sure it's not supposed to cover my whole nail?' He'd just tell me it's all fine it will be filed out. Not to mention how frustrated he would get at ME because I accidentally touched the inside of the OPI nail light box (which I'd never used before so I had no idea there was a small lip) he would continuously HUFF as he fixed it...but at lease he 'fixed' it.
I left there after paying $35, yes THIRTY-FIVE DOLLARS, and went somewhere else to have my nails fixed because I had nail polish all over the underside, acrylic stuck under my nails and on my fingers and it felt so rushed like I was inconveniencing them.
I won't go back. I hope others don't waste their time. The Anderson Walmart has an AMAZING nail salon and amazing people who work there! Please don't waste your money at this nail salon.</Review>

5 stars so you could see the review!  Super terrible service! Girls/Boys in there are so rude, and you will wait forever! Waited about 10-15 minutes for an eyebrow waxing, and then they said they didn't have enough time. Went in again for a full set, then was rudely told they didn't have time for me. If you want a rude snobby salon experience i reccomend it.</text>

My experience wasn't very enjoyable the lady I was with was rude and seemed extremely annoyed whenever I asked her to add more details to my nails. The products they used didn't seem genuine, they made me put my hand under a uv light for acrylic which doesn't make sense and when I asked them about it they freaked out like I was insulting them.  Then less then a week later a nail broke ripping part of my real nail with it (from making my bed) gems were falling off because they didn't even glue them on just used gel topcoat. Definitely wouldn't recommend or ever visit again.< /review>

They were rude to seniors. They wouldn't help my grandma get into one of the chairs to get a pedicure.<//Review>

<Text>Bubbles in my nails. They are crooked, the sides of my nails aren't completely painted. They are rude. They told me I could leave and that my nails were dry as soon as I for my keys out of my purse two nails got messed up and she refused to fix it and said "be careful"</Text><time>1493939526644<//time><rate>1< /rate>< username>

Worst place ever. Everyone is SO rude and my nails looked horrible for prom. They were clearly laughing at clients sitting in the waiting area and pointing. Getting my nails done took about 15 minutes and he didn't even do it right.. dont waste your money 😑</review>

So rude! Theyre awful workers and my nails are crooked amd have all these bubbles. Not to mention they rude to their customers. Never going there again. Ever. Worst nail place ever. The guy made me bleed 3 times doing my acrylics and asked me if it hurt AFTERWARDS. Theyre an awful place to go.< /text>

I called and asked  if I could have an appointment they said to come at 4 o'clock this was at 2:30 when I called. I walked in at 4:00 for my appointment and there were eight people ahead of me.< /Review>

<text>The people were nice enough however the man that did my nails at first told me he could do the design i wanted no problem..about halfway through he informs me that he is not able to do what i asked for..which really annoyed me..he shouldvr just said sonething in the first place and not have lied about his abilities...it turned out to be a smeared blue mess of a feather...overall it was just a bad experience..i left feeling like i had just wasted 40$..would not reccomend to any one.. Do not go!!!!</text><pics>None< /pics><Rating>1<//Rating>< GmapID>

<Review>I went for a couple pedicures. If they are slow...you can get a decent pedi with sugar scrub, functioning massage chair, decent leg massage, and nice polish job that lasts a solid few weeks.

If they are BUSY... You WILL NOT get a good pedicure; beware! Was put in a broken message chair, sorry excuse for leg massage (half the reason to go amiright?! lol), and regular polish chipped noticeably in 4 days. Very disappointing :/<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None</response><GmapID>0x54d29332c32bf87d:0xdfe9ed95339ce849</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Omar and John were extremely helpful in every way. They went the extra mile to make sure my new phone was completely set up and even helped me transfer over some of my important information from my old phone. These two are the reason why I keep coming back to this specific metro location and I will continue to do so</review>

Karina and Jon really made our experience fun. There was laughter and professionalism. Jon handled each customer that came in with the upmost respect and he moved very swiftly to make sure each customer got taken care of in a timely manner. Karina also kept the line moving. I will always come to 7651 Daly ave for any services I need. They have the best customer service and the fastest moving employees. I felt very welcomed at this location.< /Review>

Really great staff, today I walked into metro PCS to buy a new phone and I was greeted by two workers there, John and Karina I believe her name is. Not only did they help me but I felt welcomed. Other metro stores don't seem as if they care about you like this store located on Antelope. Great workers and great service.< /text>

Ok, so this place is shady. My wife lost her iPhone 8 Plus. We went to the store and the guy said they have IPhone 11’s in stock for $700. We decided to go that route. During the process the guy said it wasn’t scanned into inventory and that we had to pay cash because of that. You want us to give you $700 in green cash for a phone that isn’t in your stores inventory? Yeah, No! Sounds like some stolen iPhones to me. Stay away from this place. Go to the corporate one on Elverta.< /text>

Went in for a screen protector install and received the best service from both Jon and Ali. Jon was able to install my screen protector very quickly and they were Covid-19 prepped with their masks lol. I never have any complaints whenever I visit this location and that’s why I continue to come back whenever I need help with my devices.< /review>

I came to this door few days ago bought a new phone I requested to be on the $50 plan but the next day I got a message saying my monthly bill is $72 I called the store they told me that MetroPCS requires them to put them on the highest plan and I can change it next month so when I check my receipt they did charge me $72 forbtheir service and it appeals to offer any refund or any type of credit I would never be going back to the store ever again bad customer service</review>

I was in this MetroPCS for hours one night trying do figure out how to get my iphone working from ATT. Danish helped me the entire time and he was so patient, understanding and helpful. My experience as far as phone service has led me to this store as my go-to for assistance from now on. I appreciate the awesome customer service!< /review>

<Rating>2<//Rating><review>The gentleman that was working, Jon i think (sorry, not great with names) was locking up to go grab his lunch but He opened back up when he saw i was headed his way. He did an awesome job helping me choose a phone..👍
thank you Metro ☺

*Update 10/23/17*
I specifically went in looking for a new phone with a very good camera. I had one picked out, based on reviews.
I did tell the gentleman that helped me that I need a really good camera as I sell jewelry and need to be able to take perfect pics! He recommended the
LG K20 plus so I went with his recommendation....
***I am SO disappointed in this phone!*** My original 5 star is no longer!  The color, even the shortcuts on the homescreen, is absolutely terrible! I had to pay someone to take the pics i needed this week 😕 .... I Thought I got a good deal, until i had to pay other poeple to take my pics! Now I'm stuck between buying another new phone, or continue paying other poeple to take pics if my merchandise! ... Either way, I do believe I will be going back to Boost!

Very good service from carmen. I store at another location but here is always closer to me and they treat me like a customer of their own. Thank you might consider moving this way.</Text>

Pretty cool overall. The prices are decent. The staff is great. The bathrooms are always closed for one reason or another. But when they are open they are clean. The hours are good. But know your leave by times. The Air conditioned facility is my most favorite part. Glad I chose this location rather than the closer one.<//Text>

Lay is a wonderful customer service rep for Public Storage. She was very helpful,  thorough and knowledgeable of the  units and prices  as well as insurance and use of the key. How to use access or gain access to the unit with the passcode, elevator use when open and after I loved her sweet persona very representable and kind but the most important thing was "patience". Which most customer reps do not have they rush through everything,, but she was very patient and took her time going over the agreements and such. A+ for service..
This is why I chose this particular Public storage facility. etc I love the widr  corridors.
I fetl very comfortable walking (with the walkthrough) and I was pleased with what I saw. Along with everything else the price was not bad at all. Thanks again Lay!😃

It's was okay. The people are awesome, great customer service, very clean environment, great deals, I just had one problem. They say a dollar moves you in. But that's not true. Its $24 dollars plus the dollar. First month rent is a dollar. But then they add an $11 dollar fee for insurance and a $22 dollar expense for a 19mm cylinder lock. So in total its $58 dollars all together. It's still a good price. But they can tell you over the phone. They don't, other than that its cool</review>

<Text>I rented a unit last minute and the storage facility was able to accommodate me on the spot. I was helped by the manager Katie. She explained everything to me nicely and gave me a tour. She was able to answer all of my questions and provided suggestions for any future “just in case” situations.

It is my first time renting a storage unit and I’m glad I picked this location. I like how it is indoor and temperature controlled. It is very safe and convenient for a female like myself.

I’m looking forward to renting from this facility.</Text>< pics>

They impose additional services very well.  For example, if you do not buy a lock from them, then your cell may be stripped. Do you want to make a deal with them?< /text>

I have been a customer storage of household goods in this facility on Rosecrans. The employees have been professional and helpful. The facility is clean, dry, and environmental controls are effective.  The reason for my strong negative recommendation is the facilities and equipment offered to support goods transportation, logistics, access procedures, restroom access restrictions, and general support services are inadequate. I highly recommend selection of another storage provider. I very much wish I hadn't rented these units and will move out.< /review>

Amazing Customer Service! I was kindly helped by Rebeca, Carmen, and Jacque who you can clearly see want to genuinely help you out in making the right decisions. They were so sweet and helpful. They went through all the information very nicely and made it very easy to understand. Also their property is really clean and well organized. I would recommend this public storage facility to anyone that is looking for public storage but really wants to be helped out in a great way, they really do care for their customers here.<//Text>

<review>We have been with this storage since 2010 and both Carmen and Will and the rest of the Staff have been very helpful and very understanding especially when my brother passed away on 04/01/2019 that I have to start cleaning out the storage, the unit and the surroundings is always clean and ac is always in good condition. I would recommend this storage facility to anyone who is looking for a place to store their valuable items.< /review>< Date>

Someone spilled something two lockers away from mines i mentioned it and they got right on it and cleaned the mess. Both are people persons and make a effort to talk to you so the whole moment doesn’t seem dull when signing up.</review>< Pictures>

<Review>Had an excellent experience and would recommend this public storage to anyone in need of a storage facility. Rebeca, Jacque, and Carmen made sure I was given a proper tour of the facilities and were eager to answer any questions I had. Their hospitality and excellent customer service, not to mention clean facility, is the why I would strongly recommend this public storage to anyone in need.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

She also gave me a full tour and assured me that all of my items would fit into the space.

Therefore, I was very pleased to find a new Public Storage facility nearby that met my storage requirements. I stopped pass the PS office to fill out the new paperwork and get a tour of the storage facility. Venus showed us the proposed storage locker and helped me in filling out the required documentation. Venus is very cordial and knowledgeable about the Public Storage business. She even sold me some packing/storage materials.All in all, I greatly enjoyed my visit. I really liked the cleanliness of the facility and Venus' help and efficiency in explaining the documents to me. The other people behind the desk were also very courteous and personable, the facility is top notch, the storage lockers are immaculate and the online Grand Opening Sale is great.

I came in not knowing anything about purchasing a storage unit and I would just like to say my experience was perfect. Venus and Robyn were a great help, explained everything clearly, and were not pushy which made me feel very secure in leaving my belongings at this location. I would also like to point out how helpful and friendly they were! Over all it was a great experience and I would recommend this location, Venus, and Robyn to all of my friends and family!<//Review>

Friendly, professional staff. PS advertises call, or go online to reserve a space. They don't ask that you reserve the storage w/a credit card. They are honest there. Since doing business w/them, I'd  been ill. So monthly or so when I go I'm accompanied by a friend who helps me add to, or take away, shift things around in the space I rent. If I need something, be it from the manager, or various staff, they assist me. I have never encountered one of, and felt as though I/we were bothering them.
I absolutely have no professional and/or personal affiliation w/PS.
I am a retired US Marine. I compliment where I feel it warrants. I will also share my opinion if I feel like someone needs suggestions on conduct.

Regards,

Michael W Strider USMC, retired<//text>

Bertha and Carmen have been great from the moment I moved in! The process has been so easy despite the fact it's been a hassle moving these girls make u feel very welcomed every time the facility is always really clean and refreshing. Carts are a big help as well. Thank you Bertha and Carmen!<//review>

Venus and Amber assisted me with locating the correct size storage space for my small studio apartment furnishings.  They were both very friendly and helpful.  The price is very competitive (I shopped around). The location is super clean and very convenient.

Thanks Venus and Amber!< /text>

Great experience!  I have been at other storage facilities before and this location truly is superior.  Super clean and very new.   I really appreciate that all units are safe and secure inside of the air-conditioned building.
The staff there was the best!  Two thumbs up for both Natalie and Angie at the front desk for being super friendly, professional, and very helpful in getting me moved in without any delay at all.  It was seamless.  Great job ladies :))<//text>

<Text>Being  my first time using public storage, I was not entirely familiar with the process. However, as soon as I walked in the front desk person (i forgot her name) was very knowledgeable and friendly. I felt comfortable placing my personal belongings in the facility.

Why did I give the facility a 3 star then? Immediately after finalizing the storage unit I noticed there was a visitor for another employee in the lobby.  Eventually, I ended up being parked next to his vehicle in the enclosed parking area - I was alone and it was getting dark while I transported my belongings into the storage unit. I felt very uneasy about this interaction. I immediately notified the front desk agent that helped me. Then I took down their license plate and description.< /Text>< Pictures>

The place is clean and is easily accessible, but it's not cheap. At these prices, one should be able to live there.</Text>

I definitely recommend going to this Public Storage to anyone looking for a storage unit. With other different Public Storage around my area, I decided to go to this location and I’m honestly so satisfied with my visit. Rebeca, Jacque and Carmen were extremely helpful, their customer sevice was excellent and made sure I was well taken care of by answering any question I had about their Storage facilities. I recommend anyone to go this location, it is very clean and well organized, you’ll be well taken care of with great customer service, you won’t regret it.< /Text>

<Review>We saw this place driving by and stopped in to check rates. Adrianna was very helpful and gave us a tour of the facility. It is clean, has easy access loading area and packing supplies on site. After we signed the contract a staff called a few days later to find out if everything went well on our moving day. I am well pleased and will recommend this location.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<Review>I first went to check out the facility, and Perla gave me the tour and helped me to see which units were close to the dock, etc. She was great. I made the reservations online, and when I got there, Venus and Jennifer helped me with paperwork, move-in, everything. they were wonderful, too. The place is clean and easy to navigate.
I could have given it a 4 and 3/4 stars rating. the staff is a five, but the only flaw in the facility is that there are no drive up units. that being said, you also don't have to worry about much dust, or rain, because you're always inside.

<text>I previously spoke with Robert at the  Western location and he was so very helpful at getting me to a 1st floor storage unit.  He referred me to the New Hawthorne office where Venus was very helpful, courteous and efficient on fitting my storage needs. This Facility is beautiful and I high recommend it to anyone looking for a wonderfully priced unit.

<review>I selected a storage unit online at this location's web site.  Shortly after completing their sign up I received a call from a woman named Venus.  She set up an appointment for the next day and I went to the location then.  Venus handled all the paper work very quickly and gave me a tour of their location.  She showed me the unit I reserved and then we returned to the office to finish the registration.
Venus was very professional and friendly and made me feel welcome to be their new customer.  I give Venus and this location a very high rating!< /review>< time>

<Text>Nice clean, in building storage. The people working their are super friendly and have moving supplies for sale. But my problem lies with the gated loading bay area. It has trash everywhere that will still be their days later. It also feels very isolated back their, which makes me concerned for my safety.<//Text><Gmap_id>0x80c2b43c7c7df7f1:0xc1ae1be591787c07< /Gmap_id><userid>113144497863711392512< /userid>< Rating>

***COMPLAINT*** This location is absolutely horrible! The staff here is rude and disrespectful. Except the cleaning guy Will. I don’t know the employees name, just that she’s a Black woman with a bun. When I came in she was on the phone with someone else gossiping. I asked about renting 2 carts. I gave the ID and she stated that she would give me 1. I inquired why because they previously allowed us to use 2. I told her on my last visit they stayed I needed 2 IDs so I came in with 2. She replied 1 per person, I said ok, I’ll send in someone else. She said I’m only giving you 1. I said ok, I’ll send in the other person. She said no I’m not giving you another, people have lost keys so I’m only giving you one. I was like I said ok so I’m gonna send someone else in. She said they’re with you correct? I stated yes and then she said well I’m only giving you 1 and got back on the phone. I said you just told me 1 per person so is it 1 per unit? She said you’re not getting another cart. I tried to ask another question and she started talking over me then rudely said “Good Day”. I told her that talking over me wouldn’t stop me from asking questions and she stated that it wouldn’t stop her from doing what she was doing either. I would like to speak with someone at corporate.< /text>

My parents and I were very happy with the location and service from Mieashia. Mieashia was very attentive and funny and made sure to find us a unit that was easily accesible for my parents to get access. Wonderful service and the location is clean compared to other Public Storage locations we viewed.< /Text>

<Review>Me and my mom just recently made a reservation for a unit at this storage, the process was easy and fast. We went there today (8/5/2014) to see the storage and we were impressed to see everything so organized and clean. Venus was very helpful and she made sure that everything was going good. Natalie was very courteous and down to earth when she first greeted us. She made us feel comfortable while she was giving us the tour of the storage and she showed us two options before we seen the one we chose. Natalie was also very knowledgeable of the paperwork and did a great a job of explaining everything to us. If your looking for a new storage to move your stuff into, choose THIS ONE! Thank you Natalie & Venus! :) #KeepWorkingHard

Great employees. Shay did an awesome job helping. But the company is horrible and greedy. Too many hidden fees. (Administrative  fees, force you to buy overpriced lock even if you have your own, force you to buy insurance, even though you dont need it.) All in all, this company is shaddy and greedy. Tell me how much you gonna charge me upfront. I hope their starup competitors put them out of business!< /review>

<review>I am not one to complain, but I have had the worst customer service with this storage unit. Firstly, upon sign up, the whole $1 first month special is a scam. Add on another $60 to the total for the insurance premium, admin fee and mandatory lock. Additionally, paying my bill has been a nightmare. I do not live near the storage unit, therefore a walk-in payment is not an option. Unless I want to pay an additional fee to pay over the phone, I figured online payment would be an easy option, but I was wrong...
When trying to login into my online profile, my email was not registered upon sign up. Without this, I can not create a new profile. I figured I would call customer service and have this resolved. After 20 minutes of calling an automated customer service line and trying to be connected, I went through a loophole of options and could not be connected. I called the storage office nearly ten times through out the day, left two voicemails  and no one answered the phone. The next day I called again and they told me they couldn't help with payment options, but I could call customer service. It has been incredibly difficult to pay my bill, which seems to me to be yet another scam to get more money for a late-payment fee. DO NOT STORE HERE IF YOU CAN NOT PAY IN PERSON. Wish me luck trying to call customer service for the 10th time.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2b43c7c7df7f1:0xc1ae1be591787c07< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>At the beginning I thought fine I'll pay a dollar for the first month's rent but then they push on the insurance and the lock that is mandatory so I ended up paying $90....
When I first came in there were nice and friendly as I started coming frequently to take off stuff from my storage unit that's when all the friendliness stop. Upon renting the unit I was asked to go on Google and give them five stars before I even started my process. At times the placce is nice and clean at time i come and see all the trash thats left behind by other ppl... I'm giving it a 2-star because its much more cleaner then the one out in LA off of the 110 freeway and then Manchester....</Text><Gmap_id>0x80c2b43c7c7df7f1:0xc1ae1be591787c07</Gmap_id><Rating>2</Rating><UserId.>100836240642911814389< /UserId.></record>

< Review>
I've maintained an office, post production facility, vocal recording, green screen, essentially a Studios worth of services for an extremely demanding client base, at the Manhattan Beach Studios for the last 10 years. Depending on my needs and those of my clients, will determine what assets I required from the storage. Carmen Meshita, and Brianna are able to meet the extraordinary needs in my rather continually evolving workflows.  So I presented the girls with my most recent challenge thinking that this was going to end up costing me more money but they found a way to consolidate assets down to a single storage unit and now I'm saving at least 25% over my previous Bill - yet somehow I'm storing more assets.  Every aspect of their considerations were quite insightful even choosing a location that was strategic between the other three storage units.  The efficiencies of having one unit organized with racks surrounding the entry that's result in the ability for my team members and myself to be able to efficiently leverage our organizational infrastructure in my new 10 x 10 space.  Plus I got a $250 or so refund for something I didn't even know I had coming to me.  Simply stated my life is empowered and my creativity can now flourish much to do with the Excellence Carmen Meshita, & Brianna provided me, I would rate them On the scale to 1 to 10 they're are a solid 11.< /Review>

It all started because my company had to move our storage from the public storage in harbor city to a more convenient location. So my boss made a reservation online and wanted to rent the same day (yesterday) myself and my boss arrived at this location and was told that not only did we have an online reservation we had a regular reservation, but we wanted to ho with the one for the lower rate which was the online reservation. So carmen told us we were unable to rent until 3 pm cause our reservation was just made (mind you its 11 am) we asked if there was any way we could rent sooner as we had to go back to work. The ladies made a not do nice face and said that they could not rent to us until 3 pm and there was nothing else they could do because the system changed. As i was talking to my boss telling her this didnt happen at the other one of the girls not sure of her name interrupted our conversation & said oh so you guys are hoppers? I asked her what she meant & she asked if we had another storage i said yes we just moved out& wanted to move to a more convient location for all of us (as we have diffrent locations and hawthorne is right in the middle) she said oh well u cant move in anyways because you already had another space, even if you could you wouldn't get a promotion.. first off we no longer had the unit we had moved out second i didnt know once you had a unit you couldnt rent at another location third we weren't just looking for a promotion we just wanted the one with the lower monthly rate the girls started getting more aggressive telling us theres nothing they can do. So we ended up leaving I have been a customer with public storage before but after this i will not be back there loss,  is extra spaces gain we went & rented with them & didnt have any troubles save yourself DONT RENT HERE!!!!<//Review>< UserId.>

<text>Marc was great! He had my iPhone ready and when I had issues with it he was more than helpful fixing the touch screen! Very professional. I also brought in my Note 8 and he was able to fix the front and back screen in less than 2 hours. My phone looked brand new! They are great at fixing any phone.</text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Hate to differ. I think borderline evil is price gouging but to each their own. Have a great day.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><rate>1<//rate>< date>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>I went in thinking ima need a new charging port for my iPhone X, however instead of over charging me he told me all I needed was a cleaning! He also included if it still doesn’t charge right he would credit that 30$ towards a new charging port! He also put on a new glass screen protector for 15$. I paid 45$ total! Super fast as well! 30min max!</Text>< user_name>

Guy who answered the phone was very rude and it sounded like he was extremely inconvenienced by my call. It sounded like he was answering his own personal phone and was not a professional business.I had to ask if I had reached a phone repair business.  I guess he does not realize that first impressions are everything. I will spend my hard earned money elsewhere.< /Review>

I had almost no down time. This is the third time I use their services and I have never had a problem with them, it always been quick and reasonable.

<Text>This is place is fast! The staff is super friendly, and they got my iPhone 7 looking good as new! Thanks guys! I know some basic repair knowledge, and I had done my previous screen myself. I was curious to see if they had taken any parts, or screws on the inside, when I opened it up myself it had all the parts still inside. They even took extra care to make sure the false screws were placed back on my phone. Super honest, affordable, and they use Original LCD parts. Honestly Thanks, saved me the headache of having to order the part and do it myself.</Text>< pics>

The lady who helped him said “I don’t remember doing that though” so I called her boss and explained the situation to the owner and he started to get loud with me (MARK) telling me he’s not giving me anything free because he needs to put food on the table for his kids. When they did in fact break my LITTLE BROTHERS screen. Side note, there was a MINOR crack on the top left screen. But they did make it to where it went all the way down the screen affecting his home button to get stuck and also making the right side of the screen green. Than the boss (Mark) told me on the phone “this conversation is going no where” than hung up on me.<//review><UserId.>116937973398800890732< /UserId.></record></dataset><record>

Had a great experience with Marc here at Visalia iPhone repair! I brought in my iPhone with a cracked screen that was so bad the touch screen on the entire left side was unresponsive to touch and I could not unlock my phone. Marc had my phone tip top in less than 45 minutes and it was finished for less than $100 which was the cheapest price I found in Visalia. I found then on Google search...!! They did really good work for me. Thanks Marc and also Visalia iPhone repair...!!< /Review>

I took it to my  regular place centr valley I phone repair he said who ever replaced the screen  did secure the screws inside phone prperley .and they came out and shorted out the circut board for the display. I called them and told them .it was obvious they weren't going to standby their mess up .I've used this guy twice .only because he is open on Saturday and bot times had issues.<//text>< Name>

These guys have only basic knowledge of just repalcing parts.  I found that after my phone repair that i was missing screws in side the logicbaord and not to mention that they did not put back my shield cover on the that cover the flex cables i found from another shop.  Dont trust them save your self and your devices. Go elsewhere<//Review>

<text>Not Good I arrived and asked if they could install a wifi chip and the response was terrifying.  The gentleman sitting at the left desk told me he would use a heat gun and heat the hole iPhone up red hot and maybe it would work. I told him because he was so arrogant and unwilling to he was a parts replacer not a technician. I will not return there again. I am more of a technician than he is. I am very capable of replacing the wifi chip myself.  I am an Old Man but not stupid this person is a butcher not a tech.barley a parts changer. signed Vincent<//text></record>

I had the absolute worst experience with this company.  I took my daughter's ipad mini to repair a cracked screen.  Otherwise, it was working perfectly.  I took it in a Monday and they said i would have it by Tuesday.  I wasn't able to pick it up until Thursday.  Of course no one ever called me, i had to keep calling to get updates.  When i picked it up i noticed it wasn't working on my way home.  Upon closer review the screen wasn't even glued correctly to the ipad.  I took it back on Friday afternoon, they called me a couple of hours later to pick it up.  Again, about 5 minutes later the screen started acting cracking, snapping pictures, typing on its own, etc.  I took it back and after complaining got my $118 back.  But now after it all, i had a new screen but my ipad no longer worked.  I was forced to buy another ipad mini to replace the perfectly good working one i had.  No one to this day has offered me an apology.  They have the absolute worst customer service and obviously don't know what they're doing.  Please DO NOT GO HERE people, unless you want your expensive electronic item ruined.  I regret fully ever contacting them, should have gone to Central Valley repair, they have great reviews.  Again, you get what you pay for :(< /Text>

Went for a 40th anniversary party.  Service was amazing.  Brought us everything we asked, served the wine and champagne as we requested.  Allowed us to bring our own cake in and even cut then served it.  Really went the extra mile to make the event special.  One downside, they need a decanter for wine.<//review>

We were staying at the hotel there and happily ate dinner and breakfast here everyday. The breakfast buffet is really good with tons of options. The dinner menu is really good with lots of fresh, good food. It is a but pricy, but I didn't mind in this case. The atmosphere is good, too!</text>

<Text>It was my first time visiting Bacchus. The steak was amazing! Wine selection was decent too. It was a solid meal with excellent service.

One odd thing, however. The dining area had an unconventional set-up. It was only semi separated from the lobby area.
Initially I thought the design was inspiring and made it feel bigger. But not so great when a guest had a shouting match with someone and it felt like she was right next to you.< /Text>< pics>

<Text>I went to Bacchus for their breakfast buffet. As far as hotel breakfast buffets go it's pretty good - they have a decent selection of continental breakfast food items from chobani yogurt to baked juices. Kind of on the higher end price wise but they make up for it with quality and variety.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Ridiculous experience, wait wait wait while at least half the tables are empty.  Was told they are understaffed. REALLY???  That's BS today.  Many people looking for work, hire some or shut your doors because you definitely do not understand customer service in a service industry.  This place sucks</Text>

Had a business dinner here. Thai noodle dish was not flavorful and the vegetables in it were soggy and overcooked. Other attendees also said their entrees were not good. Waiter was friendly but forgot one of our appetizers.</text>

Highly recommended.<//review>< Pictures>

My dad and I are visiting from out of town and wanted something yummy for dinner and came across this place on google. The restaurant is absolutely beautiful and the gals that work here are incredibly sweet. Our food was incredible, fresh and came quick, and the service was A+. We are so glad we came here on our trip.</review>

Good authentic thai restaurant. Parking is bit difficult in busy hours. Restaurant is good and service is excellent. They will first serve you a small bowl of salad. We ordered some rice which was good for two people. Nice restaurant. Would love to go again<//Review>

Order your food and enjoy it by the Marina while we wait for indoor seating to return. Great lunch specials too, the price really drops</Review>< user_name>

<Date>1530935723216</Date><rating>5</rating><Review>Corn cakes are amazing. Mai Thai is one of the best casual dining Thai food places in the Bay Area, and certainly one of the few outside of Berkeley where you can taste the quality and freshness of their veggies and sauces (I'm a Thai & Indian food fanatic, though more adventurous with the former). I like the pork red curry without jalapeños, as I've lost a bit of spicy food tolerance. If you're a local, you should also check out other eats in the strip mall. They're really high quality meals at low prices. Definitely a favorite food spot.</Review>< pics>

If you want a delicious, filling, three-course meal for two, this is the place to go!

Start with an order of the Spring Rolls. These rolls come with a delicious peanut sauce that adds a kick. Next, is the fried Calamari. Yet another dish, for two, dipped in a tangy, mildly-spicy green herb sauce.

For the main plate, split the Pineapple Chicken Curry, which goes excellent when drizzled over the Pineapple fried rice, and enjoy the plethora of delicious, mouth-watering, spice and flavor.

For an even fuller experience, order a milk tea with boba to go along with your meal.

Excellent food and excellent service!<//review>

<text>Flavorful food and good sized portions. Not ideal for vegetarians like us. We told the waitress we were vegetarian and so we ordered the pumpkin curry with mixed vegetables, pineapple fried rice (with egg were not vegan) and corn cakes. However we noticed a fish taste in the curry and asked the waitress about it. She said yes all Thai curries have fish sauce. Thus the three stars. For carnivores this is a good Thai restaurant. Food was served hot and very tasty. $40 bucks including tip.</text><gmapID>0x808f855669d93569:0x978b3381866e7485</gmapID><Date>1558251743889< /Date></record>

<Text>I went there tonight and ordered satay chicken. The peanut sauce was really thick and didn't taste like any peanut sauce I've ever tasted. I also got the Indian fried bread with yellow curry. The curry was runny and tasted like fish. I did not like my food at all and I spend 20$. I would not recommend this place at all.<//Text>< Pics>

<review>Worst Thai food I ever had in all honesty. Bootleg Thai food. The dish I had didn’t taste anything like traditional Thai food. The garlic chicken dish had a fishy flavor to it.

I love going here for special occasions, but typically I always order to go. either way ive always had an attentive and friendly wait staff. Highly recommended

Last visit: had to drop it down a couple stars. Not the normal staff I'm used to, but they quoted me 15 min for a to go order, it took 30 minutes to get  it. Normally the staff gives me realistic wait times for my order  ( I'll gladly wait an order for 30 min if I know it'll be hot and ready in 30), but my entree came out cold and not to my expectation of this place.
I hope my next visit is better. They normally are the best.<//text>

<text>This restaurant is cute place to eat Thai food. I recommend to go there during lunch hours during the week for good prices from 1pm to 3pm and reopen  at 5pm for dinner.  The food is delicious.  You can request hot sauces if they don't serve it (hidden gem) for spiciness.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x808f855669d93569:0x978b3381866e7485< /Gmap_id></record>

<Review>I LOVE this Place!!!

The Family Oriented Staff here is absolutely Beautiful and Wonderful. They are Very consistent and the Food is always on Point! The Chardonnay Wine is VERY Chilled the way I Like It! The atmosphere is Cozy and Very Clean (Including the restroom). I recommend this Spot! I give them 5.... No 7.... No, 10 STARS if I could!!</Review><Name>David Mack< /Name>< GmapID>

<user>113176626421251188366<//user><text>We got good and quick and friendly service at first, but later the food came a little bit too late.

The food was really nice with decent portions. The prices were good.

The atmosphere is really not much to write home about. so you really don't want to go there on a Friday night to lunge around wit ha bunch of friends.  But its a great place to go on weeknights.< /text><gmapID>0x808f855669d93569:0x978b3381866e7485<//gmapID><Response>None</Response>< rating>

All the positive reviews are technically correct, but the food itself is very bland - not what you would expect from Thai food. Two dishes in particular were very boring and poorly seasoned:  Tom Yum Goong and Pad Thai. These are normally quite spicy, but in this place they were a yawn. When I asked for the "hot" versions, they ignored the request. Typical "Americanized" Asian food.</Text>

I came here for lunch for the first time. It was packed, luckily I called in first. When they said 25 minutes I knew it was gonna be poppin. I ordered the pad see ew with chicken -My go to- and I wasnt blown away, but it was good. I've had better and for the long lines I imagined it was gonna be amazing. Still I think it's worth going again. I will be back.<//text>

Food is delicious and affordable. The service, however, is horrible. My entire table was finished eating,and they still hadn't brought my food. The same happened to a colleague a week before. Too bad.< /Review>

This is my number one cigarette stop shop. They have the best prices. I personally smoke American Spirits and I get them for the lowest price in town here. Staff is also always so polite and kind. Absolutely come here for a good deal.< /text>

< Review>
Extremely rude, the cashier became upset with me because I wanted to pay with a credit card. Even after I provided my identification he continued to mumble stuff under his breath and scream repeatedly "this is the last time never again". He definitely didn't warn me of any additional fees. Seriously, take your business elsewhere. They sadly don't deserve it😵<//Review>

If I could do zero I would. Nothing against the day to day workers at the post, the managers set them up to fail.

A package "arrived" at my address the other day. I was at work, but my partner was home. When I received the delivery notification it was marked that my package had been delivered to an individual, so I assumed that mean the one in my residence. I also assumed it meant the package had not been left outside on my doorstep, as that is a separate button. Well because it was marked in that manner I didn't think I would need to check in with my partner to see if she could retrieve it from the porch, as it was marked as delivered to an individual.

Because of the amount of time my package remained on my doorstep, even though I live in a gated residence currently with no immediate neighbors in the courtyard complex, the package was stolen. I don't know who stole the package, really the postman could have stolen the package if he wanted to, as I learned later. I went to file an insurance claim, and was told there was nothing to be done for me by a woman who claimed to be the supervisor. If she was the supervisor it was clear she had not been trained to be the supervisor because her customer service skills were less than negligible, she claimed it wasn't their responsibility as the package had been "delivered". I'm not contesting whether or not they attempted to deliver it. What I am saying is they fed me misinformation that resulted in the package being stolen, if they didn't steal it themselves. The salt of it all is they make you pay extra to insure packages, and if the insurance isn't covering human error and incidentals on their end what on earth is it covering?

This really is the equivalent of someone telling you to turn around then tossing you a ball, and when it crashes into your head turning it around on you are saying "Well why didn't you catch it?"

Avoid the USPS if this is your main post office.< /review>

The lady there incorrectly stated and insisted so that Department of State has no option for 'File Search' following it up with she cannot take my application and cannot help me any further. I had to use the 'File Search' option as the postal service had lost the certified mail containing my original documents, which is distressing enough. I later when to another post office. The person at the other post office knew what I was trying to do and was incredibly helpful.

USPS lost my certified mail, which requires my signatures confirming delivery. On enquiry with Java Drive supervisor, he informed me the mailman/carrier signed himself, incorrectly wrote he left to an individual (shows up as Delivered, Left with Individual on USPS tracking) and left the certified in my mailbox. Ironically another supervisor at this Java Drive post office told me that USPS is receiving complains of missing mail as some perpetrators are stealing mail from mailboxes looking for Covid checks sent by IRS. So USPS knows mail is being stolen, yet my carrier leaves my certified mail, which require signatures in my mailbox and signs himself.</text><username>Mandeep Singh</username><Rate>1<//Rate><user>105462352858067934594< /user>< Response>

<text>The self-serve kiosk is broken, frozen on the terms and conditions screen, and I was met with open hostility when I tried to let the employees know.

Come early to avoid any wait time. I arrived before noon and was assisted promptly — Arlene helped me get my package ready in minutes. This location has a self-service kiosk and well stocked with packaging supplies. The day I went there were two associates available and less than 5 people inside so it was a very quick visit.<//text>

7 minutes after leaving this location after trying to tell the manager that the dimensions are in the guidelines of this package, I went to another location and the competent workers were able to handle this in a very polite successful manner. Sad to see how management is incompetent in certain degrees. Been contacting upper management to resolve this issue or to get better training for these USPS workers.

Refused to ship my package due to some error. Never responded to my voicemails, did not answer the phone. When I went to the post office to handle it they said they couldn't help me. They said the manager would call me back but never did. They had my package but returned to sender anyway. Incompetent workers. Avoid this place</text>

<review>Terrible staff. They lied and tried to sell me expansive express service. I only needed a certified mail service and they said they do not have it and I have to use priority express, which is 3 times the price! hehe it is right behind the counter and I can see it! Also tried to ask me to pay for a priority express when I purchased a money order, saying it is the only way to see if people received it?! They are probably on commission and are dying to sell you expansive service.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

Horrible service! They lost mail from my house.  Two of which have become a lot of money for me.  A fine was one of them, which when not receiving it charged me two fees, and I had to go to court to try to lower the fine because not receiving the letter I had to pay more.  Another email they lost was my passport.  And they were not responsible for the losses of those letters.<//text>

I was on hold for an hour finally the call dropped bc nobody answered and their office close at 5pm. I scheduled appts online. Next day I walked in I experienced a very sluggish customer service in the passport section.

<Review>For the past few months, a good portion of my packages were misdelivered. On average I have about 7 missing packages per month. They always claim that its been delivered in mailbox but its never in my mailbox. Or they will say that they left it by the front door and its not by the front door even though I have been home all day long.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

I was at home entire day. I did not receive call nor knocked on my door. I had to leave office to go to USPS office as it was urgent. I came to know that they have a "process that if the floor is above 2nd floor" they wont deliver packages. They should have atleast called me on my phone but that did not happen. I am pretty sure my society receives packages in office but they did not bother to deliver at the society office too.< /text>< Date>

<review>My mail box gets usually filled up with all the junk i receive from USPS. So once in a while the carrier takes back all the mail stating that i will have to come pick it up at the post office. Though i make it a point to check up my mail box as much as i can the sheer volume of  junk which gets delivered to your mail box is big that it is hard to keep with it every few days. The post office should consider leaving a warning on the door of the customer that their mail box is full so that arrangements could be made to pick it up<//review>< Pictures>

The manager is not professional at all. My PRIORITY mail doesn’t have updated for a month. I consulted her and what she was doing is getting away from any responsibility. She never say that it’s her fault and won’t do anything for me. What a horrible experience.<//Review>

It is a good post office generally.   Today I had a bad experience.  While I had not finished with the clerk,  the people behind me was standing right behind me.  He was supposed to stand behind a line further back.< /review>

Pleasant experience on my end. They were quick to accommodate my delivery needs and great customer service. Came on a Saturday around 930am and was out in about 10min.

I'd come back to this post office!</Review>

<Text>I've had an overall positive experience. I've been to this post office multiple times for various reasons (from 2015 to now) - to purchase stamps/envelopes, to track a missing package, to send packages. I usually go mid-day or early morning and don't have to wait more than 10 mins in line.

Wendy Lam is especially helpful, she always ensures you get the best service for the least price, often assisting people on which service to use, which envelope to purchase. She walks out from behind the counter to assist you, instead of just vaguely pointing to the right envelope type (as some other employees did)

The reason I give it 4 stars and not 5 is that I've met the occasional unhelpful employee, either they're having a bad day or you just got unlucky. I've consistently gotten better service at this post office than the ones in Santa Clara<//Text>< pictures>

<text>I go in, use the self service station to weigh and buy stamps for three small packages, barely the size of a paperback. The only thing I forgot (as humans sometimes do) is to seal them with tape. I go up to the counter and ask the lady to help me seal them. No, she says, I have the option to buy a roll of their (overpriced) tape. Surprised, I ask if she can help me by sparing three small pieces of tape for my packages. She says no, that it is my responsibility to make sure my packages are sealed.

What about the responsibility of protecting the customer's experience? It's no wonder the postal service is leaking money. Comparing that to my experience with a FedEx two weeks prior, where the person working the desk helped me not only seal, but effectively pack my packages, this was a bomb.

I don't need to be condescended to at a shipping facility trying to retain my business. The world is full of options these days.  The better ones care about your experience, not saving a buck on miscellaneous supplies.<//text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x808fb7c6e2355d25:0x810241d526acacfe<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>Going in, I expected the worst service possible as I've read a lot of negative feedback about this post office in general. I only got to communicate with the person in the passport renewal room as I went to this office to renew my passport. The person in the room, whose name was Mary Ann, gave me the best service possible and made my job as easy as it could be. The 5 star rating is only because of the service I got from her. For those who are applying for or renewing your passports Mary Ann is highly recommendable.< /review>< user_id>

The mailman for our area must have changed because I have had more mail delivery issues in the last week than ever before along with my neighbors. It's so bad that the mailman just puts whatever mail in the apartment boxes so neighbors are just leaving mail on top of the mailboxes for you to figure out who it belongs to. This is very illegal for this mail carrier to do and not even bother to try to correct it for over a week now. Sunnyvale mail service is terrible especially Ayala Dr. area<//Text>

My package was easily posted after a short wait in line (ten minutes with 15 + people in front at noon) and then sat down to wait for my appointment. I was about 30 minutes early; they opened the passport office exactly on time. It was quick and easy because I had my DS-11 filled out and a photocopy of my license and birth certificate with me, so everything was good.

This place has got to get new management!! WORST customer service by the manager Larry, and incompetent clerks. Larry could care less about the fact that their phone number doesn't work. He didn't give me a chance to fully finish my sentence, and therefore he never could understand what I was complaining about. Note to you, Larry, LISTEN to your customers and actually let them finish speaking before rudely interrupting. If you listen, maybe you could actually help your customers, which is your job. If you cant do that, you should leave. They lost my package and didn't seem to know what happened to it after Greg the delivery guy scanned it in. Neither Greg nor Larry called me back like they said they would, and apparently it was delivered to my house the next day. I was not there to receive it, so they took it back without leaving any notice. The only reason I knew it was delivered was because the company that I ordered the package from has wonderful customer service and notified me that that happened (they knew I was on the lookout for their package, which was supposed to be delivered 5 days prior). This place and the people working here are awful. One of the worst experiences I have ever had with completely incompetent, rude people!<//text>

When I lived in this zip code my mail was often misdelivered and I often received other people's mail.  Now that I have moved and submitted the change of address form over a month ago and received confirmation of the change in their system at my new address, the deliverer continues to deliver my mail at my old 94089 address.< /Text>

The guy lied to my face just to avoid doing his job. I called in advance about how to replace mailbox keys. They  told me to bring utility bill to prove residence. When I came to the post office it was totally a different story. The guy said it could be I was paying bills for someone else. But he refused to explain what other documents I need to prove I live there. He even lied that the HOA would have a copy of the key, and suggested that I come on Monday. His expression was like "I do not care what trouble you have as long as I do not need to do any work".< /text>

There’s a lady named Violet working as a clerk and I had a horrible customer service  experience with her.  She has a very rude tone. When we asked a favor from her, she just rests her chin on her hand and sits down in a lazy manner.  She refused to listen to anything we ask for and didn’t carry out anything we requested.  Just be warned going here :(< /Review>

A huge parking lot is divided into a tiny lot for visitors and the rest is fenced off. Public parking is inadequate, and there is no street parking nearby. So public is permitted to park in the gates area. How they can do it when the gate is locked? Apparently no one in the post office cares. Cars are waiting for a place, blocking the only entrance and the one lane street.<//review>

<Text>The worst customer service I have ever encountered. I sent my package last week and it was returned 3 days later with the package damaged. The package has a very big "Fragile" mark on the package but still got damaged. I filed a claim online and they told me to bring the item to a USPS to do inspection. I took the package the this USPS and they told me that they cannot do the damage report if I cannot leave my package to them for several days. But I need the package to ask my friend to deliver the package again tomorrow and that's why I sent it one week ago. The clerk keeps saying she cannot do the inspection and told me to send an email to USPSto aks if I don't need to keep the item at the USPS. If yes, then she will do the inspection now. That's rediculous and unacceptable. That means she can do the inspection now. The worst customer service I have ever had.....<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<Date>1420071626888< /Date><rate>1</rate><Text>This was an awful experience. I had a package that I missed and I went online to have it re-delivered on a day where I would be home from work. The day comes, and I'm waiting around and it never shows. I call the next day first thing in the morning. First I called the one on Fremont Avenue because that is the address on slip. I'd like to mention that they were extremely polite and had three people looking and could not find the package. He said I would have to call the main office and have them look into it so that they could get ahold of the courier.

I called them and first the woman cut me off and then asked me what my problem was again. She said that they didn't have a request for re-delivery listed for that address. I asked her if it would help for me to give her the tracking number as it says on the tracking website that the request for re-delivery went through. She groaned in exasperation and took the number and asked for my address again, accused this of not being my package because the name on the package is "Jess" and I am a woman, and then said she would talk to a supervisor and he would get back to me.

Six hours passed. It got to 4pm and I wanted to make sure there was progress. When I called the same woman didn't seem to remember me and I gave her the information again and she forwarded me to the supervisor who had never even heard of this situation. I gave him the details and then he said he would look into it. I asked when I should expect to hear back from him seeing as they close in two hours, he said he couldn't give me an answer for that and asked me to call the first facility again because this wasn't really his job. When I asked if there was another manager I could speak to he said that the manager was out and he could take a message but didn't see the point.</Text>< pictures>

<Rating>4<//Rating><text>I was looking for three hundred 70 cent stamps for a work mailing and needed them within a few days (so not enough time to have them shipped). I first went to the Mtn View main post office where they only had eighty stamps (definitely not enough). They searched the USPS system which stated that this main Sunnyvale post office had seven hundred 70 cent stamps on hand. I tried calling multiple times (between 2 & 3 pm on a Friday afternoon) to confirm they had the stamps I needed but no one ever answered. I decided it was worth the drive over and sure enough not only did they have the stamps but I was pleasantly surprised by the 3 women staffing the front desks. They were each very kind and curious about my mailing. After reading the awful review I had been reading going to this location but it was nothing like the previous review had depicted. Perhaps the management has changed and maybe the difference is staff during the week versus the weekend. Either way I was very happy with my Friday afternoon visit to the Sunnyvale post office.<//text>< pics>

Perfectly pleasant and helpful clerks. They were servicing everyone really fast. All the bad reviews give these hard working people a bad rep.<//text>

< review>
One of the worst Ever Experience.. the manager of the office might have cancellation but still not accept walk ins instead.... She was very Rude  when we asked if we can be back.. (technically no one was on the door) and we were there with fully filled and ready documents... What a shame on them to completely disregard and not care for people who need to update passports.</review>

<review>There's one Asian lady who's extremely unhelpful at this place. I asked her to copy a page before I mailed my package. She said they don't have a printer. Well of course they do. I had to wait for another guy who helped me copy without any hesitation. So for anyone's coming to this location, AVOID the Asian lady if you need to do anything more complicated than mailing a sealed package.</review>< Response>

<Review>Worst customer service ever . I went to get a package that i never received because they said my address does not exist. I don't know how it doesn't when i always received my mail with no problems . The lady looked like she wanted to go home and never even looked for my package . All she said was no we don't have your package without even looking . Then i asked her why there was a return to sender because my address did not exist when it does and all she replied was i don't know why. Why do they hire useless people like that . Go to fed ex people . Less problems there</Review>< rating>

<pictures>None< /pictures><Text>Overall, I am beyond impressed by the level of professionalism and care I have received from the Sunnyvale branch. The fact that I have a point of contact to help with my business needs is above and beyond my expectations of working with USPS.

My driver, in particular, has made my life as a startup business owner so much easier. I moved my business to Sunnyvale from Los Angeles in April and expected to hire someone dedicated to fulfillment, shipping, and making drop-offs at USPS and FedEx. I didn't end up needing to hire someone because of how responsive and accommodating USPS and my driver has been. For a new business with a limited budget this has been huge. It means that I can dedicate more time to getting the word out about my business and developing new products.

Our regular driver offered me his personal cell phone number so that I can communicate with him on a daily basis. He suggested this after I had scheduled a recurring pickup daily (to save myself the time and effort scheduling pickups) but only had packages 4/6 days a week. Now, I make it a point to text him daily with the updated status. If there are no packages, he's off the hook and can save time. If I have more packages that day, he can tell his manager that there is a large pickup and send a 2nd truck. It works so well and I have enjoyed getting to know my USPS driver. It almost feels like how I imagine the 1950s to be when the mailman is part of your daily routine and adds to your sense of community. He asks questions about my business and I feel like he genuinely cares about our success. He even lets me know when he's finishing up in the building's mail room so that I can hurry up and finish preparing orders. When I was on vacation last week he texted a photo to reassure me that FedEx had picked up my packages so that I could have peace on mind! This is a level of service that is unheard of!

I felt like giving this feedback because my impression is that USPS only receives negative feedback from customers. I have seen drastic improvements in the operations and professionalism of USPS over the years and I think this story deserves to be told. It kind of reminds me of the Domino's re-branding when they drastically improved their product/service. Keep up the good work!</Text>< rate>

<text>The worst!  The absolute WORST "service" imaginable!  Absolutely DISGUSTED beyond all words to describe it.  First, I get an email notification telling me an expected package is 'undeliverable' (whether because the carrier is illiterate--a strong possibility--or some other reason is unknown.)  Then, when I tried calling phone-numbers & getting dumb recordings basically repeating the same non-information as the email.  Then, when I select the option for the facility where the package supposedly is being held, I'm given a wrong address where there isn't even a post-office anymore!  When I finally arrive at the dump on Java, the so-called "customer service" reps give me a treatment that could provide lessons in rudeness to DMV employees.  As of now, I still have yet to receive my package, and no word on why the package was undeliverable, where it is, or where in the name of God I can go to (God willing) pick it up or when.  Utterly useless, totally incompetent "service" all around at all levels.  This kind of nonsense could ONLY be tolerated in Civil Service; you screw up like this in the private sector, you quickly get canned (and with good reason!)< /text>< Name>

<text>The postman came to my office at 6PM to deliver my package, and of course the entire office building is closed because it's 6PM! But instead of redeliver the package the second day, they simply RETURNED my package to the sender because it was "Undeliverable"?!

Terrible customer service.  I had my mail on hold during vacation, and it was never delivered after the mail hold expired.  When I tried to call, the line was always busy.  So, I went to the post office, picked up my own mail, and asked for a package which I was expecting.  I was told there was no package on hold.  The next day the package was delivered with a note, "redeliver, off mail hold".  The problem is I needed that package the day it was delivered too late.  Why was I told there was no package when there obviously was? Why was my mail not delivered at all?  And, why is the phone off the phone all day so that no one can get through?  I even received a phone call, after I filed a complaint, and was told to call the main number, which I have done numerous times today with the same result....busy, busy, busy.  Why in in world would someone leave a message to call and then have the phone set to be busy all the time?  Again, terrible customer service and unfriendly clerks.</Text>

Came in to get my package today. Instead of putting a key in my box they put a "im sorry we missed you slip" then they refused to give me package because it was past 5. They were right there behind the door and i kept knocking and they just ignored. I need that stuff for tomorrow. People kind of suck</Review>

Customer service is terrible. I think they are Filipnos who do not consider customer needs and quality. Spoke to supposedly a Supervisor named, Hector Alacanga. Was on hold for so long. Difficult to contact. Lack of service and timeliness.

Need overall re-organization.< /review>

The postal service is the worst for weekend deliveries. I think they make the most lazy and incompetent people work this shift. 9 times out of 10 they will not deliver the package because my house is considered a business that is closed. The lazy a$$ drivers just don't want to deliver anything but still get paid.</text>

I cannot give even one star... But no way to give 0.1 star. Ann is so unfriendly and gives me wrong info. She gave me bad impression on USPS that I used for the first time in the US.</Review>

<name>alexis woldhuis</name><review>Super awesome store. Everything is reasonably priced. Its my go to spot for anything that I might need while I'm at work. I've never seen the line get too long and the cashiers are super nice. They even let me return a pair of headphones that I couldn't get to work even though I had opened the package. Nice sales and right now, they have school supplies for CHEAP!<//review>< user_id>

<text>I like the price for everything, the only thing is that you can't try on clothes and can not get your money back (bummer) only exchange or store credit, but other than that is all good. No complaints.</text>< pics>

It's gone baby, gone! Fallas P is no more. Only 2 stores continue to be open... This is NOT one of them. This Fallas sucked anyway, it was literally infested with mosquitoes.</Review>

(Translated by Google) The store is fine, the only thing that is not right is that they do not give you a bag, it is not a market, it is a store of clothes and things for the home and it is not good that one comes out with clothes in hand

(Original)
La tienda está bien lo único que no está bien es que no te dan bolsa no es una market es una tienda de ropa y cosas para el hogar y no está bien que salga uno con la ropa en la mano< /Review>

Greens were really georgeous especially because this is a desert course and it's been really hot weather wise. Everyone knows everyone, very helpful and very laid back. Nice place to golf & spend the nite.<//review>

<Text>18 hole golf course, tennis courts, restaurant, bar, and swimming pool on site. Lodges to rent if you are coming from out of town. Lake with fishing next to the golf course. Of course with Covid-19 around things are very different, but this place has been around a long time and has always been an oasis in this desert.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

What a hidden jewel.  I attended a wedding here and the food and acomadations were very nice.  The staff was very helpful and friendly.  The building itself is a bit aged, and the AC wasn't working well on what seemed to be the hottest day of summer.  But other than that it was a great event venue.< /text>

This is a great golf course. It is a private country club but is open tp all on Mondays at a great low price of less than $ 50.00 including a cart. The greens are one of the best in So Cal and are quite challenging. The views from the golf course are spectacular. A wonderful place to play golf.<//text>

A little out of the way but worth the trip. Challenging but not over the top.
Great people and professional services.<//Review>

The course was excellent. The Staff was professional. The "Locals" were drunk, very immature,  and insulting. To mock an individual for his missing limb and to actually try to start a fight with him was ridiculous. The better men walked away like adults.< /review>

Dr. Dave and the nurses are very nice and professional. They take great care making sure to keep you comfortable. I had five stitches on my hand and Dr. Dave did a great job. Thank you!

Went back for a follow up. Dr. Carrie was really nice and helpful. She provided excellent advice. The nurses here are nice and friendly.< /review>

The young lady at the front was very professional and polite. I was able to wait in my vehicle while they called me in. Once I was in the physician was able to exam me and went out of his way to make sure the imaging center he was going to refer me to was in my insurance network. He asked the receptionist to fax in the form and also give me a hard copy. The whole process from the moment I checked in took 1 1/2. Not bad for a Monday evening at an Urgent Care if you ask me. 10/10 recommend.<//review><user_name>Cynthia Coronado</user_name><time>1620104192804<//time>< pictures>

I have a mask exemption. I walked in without one on. Was admitted and taken through all the steps and then spoken to by the front desk girl at least 3 times. Then after I was all signed in she suddenly tells me, me and my 5 year old HAVE to wear masks in order to go to the back. I said very politely "I can't wear masks I'm sorry". She then became aggressive and told me well sorry but we can't see you without a mask on. I said "I can't wear a mask". She said "okay why? ", I said that's private". Then said, "okay so you're telling me your office is refusing me service because I can't wear a mask?"  She said yes. I said is your office manager here and she said well we have a sign on the door saying it's required. I replied, still calm and polite, "I'm sorry but I still can not wear a mask I don't think you understand, it's not that I just don't want to,  I can not. She was at this point trying to intimidate me into wearing one and I said why don't you go to the back and ask before I walk out of here and call back to ask about this. She walked away with a bad attitude and didn't return. They called about 3 people in before me and left us waiting for a long time. Mind you it's an urgent care unit. My 5 year old daughter had a serious emergency.

They finally called us in. The doctor was to the point and seemed annoyed. I thanked her for seeing us.  She heard me out, did the exam then left. When I tried to go get water she loudly told me we have to stay in the room because of the other patients.

Over all... people need to understand that some people literally can not wear a mask and should not be harassed, intimidated or treated differently for this fact.  Just because we are gay I mean black I mean can't wear a mask.< /review>

The facility is clean and tidy.  The doctors and nurses are very friendly, gentle, and patient.

I went in first thing early on Sunday morning and I was able to be seen, treated, and on my way home in less than 30 mins. I didn't feel like the doctors or nurses rushed to get me in and out.  They are just that efficient.  They took the time to listen to my concerns and they even asked clarifying questions to make sure they got all the information and details they needed to accurately diagnosis and treat me.

I highly recommend Cypress Urgent Care facility.<//Text>

Drove 20+ miles for urgent care need, and it was a great choice. Other urgent care facilities nearby were rude and seemed to careless, but nurses and doctors here are different. Despite how busy the are, they took time to listen and diagnose. I would definitely come back again. Very thankful for their attention and great customer service.<//Text>

I just took my mother here on two occasions for symptoms of bronchitis. Both times, the NP told her that an xray was not necessary and that what she had was a virus. So she sent her home with an inhaler. Come to find out? My mother had pneumonia and influenza A&B. Now due to her age? These things can be fatal.

I used to like this place because it was quick and the staff were very friendly. However, thanks to COVID? The service quality has gone to s***. Please do not go here especially with an elderly loved one.<//Review>

Nurse Olga was super kind, wonderfully patient, & completely attentive towards my elderly mom and compassionate towards her and her injured foot!! She was tender, yet efficient, when wrapping up her foot with an ace bandage like a true Pro!! Took her mere seconds!!
And Dr Devaraj was just as impressive....kind, compassionate, and thorough!! We never felt rushed or dismissed. And he was the one who called me the next day to confirm his original diagnosis of no break😍, once the radiologist gave him the report, after asking me to call in to get the results. Wow, do Doctors do that? This doctor did!!
Couldn't have been more impressed or more pleased with our visit to Cypress Urgent Care!! It is now our Urgent Care of choice, after going to several others in the immediate area. Love this place and you will too!!👍
Thanks for taking such great care of my most treasured family member!!💖<//Text>

I've been waiting for the doctor for an hour because she's in a meeting taking her sweet time. However, other nurses and MD have check on me but no medical help.< /review>

So I got a dog bite above my eye. They took me in right away!!! I was impressed with EVERYONE. From the person working the front desk,to the technicians,nurses and the PA Dustin. I am very very happy with my care. They are all friendly and welcoming. Last place I wanted to be at BUT the care was above and beyond</text>

<review>My Wife is a retired RN, Ph.D and I'm a retired DSD, & Paramedic from Los Alamitos AFRC for over 30 years of service.  This is truly the best Urgent Care Center that I have ever experienced.

All of the staff was curteous. The check-in and out process was swift and organized. Juan was our nurse/medical assistant he was very caring and careful with my 9 year old daughter who had an ankle injury. They have xrays in house which made it very convenient. The PA was very thorough at explaining and discussing her diagnosis, treatment and prognosis.
I would use this urgent care again. :)</Text>

After a car accident, I went to Cypress Urgent Care. When I checked in I was told there were only 2 patients ahead of me. Even though, I told them I was in a car accident, was limping and had a clearly broken finger, I waited over 2 hours in a hospital gown in a cold room while the female PA continued to take COVID related patients ahead of me. I could hear all of the visits as they were on speaker. Some people wanted COVID clearances for work while others wanted prescriptions for coughs. Yet, I sat shivering in pain. Even though I heard the medical assistant kindly remind her a car accident patient was in a room, she kept taking COVID related patients ahead of me. Ultimately, I got dressed and spoke with the receptionist to let her know I had not been seen. The receptionist stated that the PA had patients outside in an alley to see first. I left to seek other medical care. This disregard for patients without COVID concerns was disappointing. This is definitely not an urgent care you want to go to if you do not have COVID.<//review>

Thank you for figuring out what is wrong. I am so glad my Dr referred me to your Urgent Care.

Will see you in my future when urgent care is needed.

I will refer friends, family & flight attendant's to your.

Thank you

The front desk and nurses were very friendly and helpful. We were both seen by doctor Handel. He is an awesome doctor. He was very patient, a great listener, and wonderful at explaining.  I love how good he took care of my dad he had nurses flush out his ear, took chest x Ray's, and most importantly he gave prescriptions! Have you ever been to a doctors office and left with no prescription, and a list full of unanswered questions?!  Well at this location that wont be the case. I'm sure you will leave feeling taken care of. I will definitely come back to this location.< /review>< name>

Cypress Urgent Care is a bit out of the way for me rite now. However, I take the long trip by bus there because the staff and doctors are so pleasant and polite. I receive a thorough examination and the diagnosis is explained in a way that is that I can understand. I a.m treated with the utmost respect which makes going to the doctors a pleasant experience rather than a stressful one. To the doctors and staff, thank you for the wonderful way you treat your patients. I will continue to keep coming back. Thank you.<//review>

My real name is Sheri but I wanted to say Dr. Hanel is EXCELLENT!  This was the first time that I wasn’t shuffled out to my PCP.  He took the time to REALLY HELP ME!  He was very thorough!  And his staff... they were so professional and super nice!  I really wish they were a regular office that I could see regularly because it’s rare to find a team like this! 💗🙏🏻🙌🏻🙏🏻💗<//Review>

<review>20 minute wait on a Sunday morning.  Everyone seemed genuinely interested in providing care.  The doctor was in a real "problem solving" state of mind.   There is a refreshingly helpful vibe here.</review>< response>

This poor place was topped to max, even the very helpful receptionist was sick.  Doing her best to help the sick.    Because of these reasons I'm giving them 3 stars.</review><Name>Claudia Chaddock< /Name><Pictures>None<//Pictures><user_id>115103061967331777077</user_id>< Gmap_id>

WORST urgent care experience ever. This place is poorly run. I WAITED just shy of FOUR HOURS to be seen. I literally waited two hours in the lobby and then another hour and fifty five minutes in the exam room. When I was in the exam room my throat was swabbed for strep and no one came back for almost two hours. NO COMMUNICATION from anyone. When I was finally seen by a physician, he offered no apology for such a long wait, proceeded to ask me a few questions and told me that I tested negative for strep. He said that he doubted I had mono but would test me anyway. The medical assistant came back to test me for mono and made a joke. How funny these people have time for jokes but no time to take ten seconds to communicate with people about what to expect. The physician then told me I tested negative for mono and that I have a respiratory infection. He didn't even use a stethoscope to check my lungs or anything. The only thing he did was check my ears and look at my throat. I would call this INSUFFICIENT QUALITY OF CARE. I waited almost FOUR HOURS for the physician to give me an INCOMPLETE EXAM. The people working here could use some help in regards of building compassion and communication to the patients they are supposed to be HELPING. The physician could have been more thorough and could of at least been empathetic about the EXCESSIVE wait I had to experience.
ALSO, while I was waiting in the lobby, I watched the front desk tell incoming patients the wait will be over three hours when they close in two hours. It seems like they were trying to deter patients from signing in. It's clear the ladies at the front desk don't now what's going on as I could over hear their conversation about whether a patient was present or not. They were also repeatedly trying to call patients back who have walked out and left long ago and do not know who is next on the list and which patients are still here.
In addition, this place was dirty. The lobby chairs were all sunken in and ripped and trash all over the dirty floor. It looked as if the floor hadn't been mopped in a week. There were also roach traps in the bathroom and trash all over the bathroom floor.
This place seems poorly run, understaffed and employs incompetent staff, and unsanitary to boot. I would not recommend and urge others to avoid!< /review>

<Text>Most of the people that I’ve encountered here have been friendly, but most of them don’t have much phone etiquette. They’re not as pleasant over the phone when you call in to ask a question. I also don’t appreciate the fact that when a prescription is put in that they don’t Look for a 24 hour pharmacy when you go to urgent care later in the evening. I’ve been waiting for my prescription for two hours to find out that they sent it to a pharmacy that closed before I even went to urgent care. Now I am scrambling to find a 24 hour pharmacy so I can get an inhaler that I desperately needed tonight. Other than that, the wait times aren’t usually that bad for this urgent care.< /Text>< pics>

I went back to cypress for them to correct the orthopedics poor work. When it comes to being sick or having a broken bone or whatever it may be, they are amazing.<//Review>< rating>

This was my first visit at this urgent care.   The front office person was efficient, unwelcoming, abrupt,  did not hear a service words or phrase from her to me or other pts.   The back office person was personable, the Dr was pleasant, to the point,  but I did not feel rushed.<//review>

<gmap_id>0x80dd292c1814695d:0x305d0243cb09c798</gmap_id><Text>I went to Cypress Urgent on Friday morning because I had a terrible cough and sore throat. My ears were popping and cold sweats. When I went to Cypress Urgent Care December 2017 I had the exact same symptoms. Friday Handel PA advised me that I had a upper respiratory injection. Same diagnosis as December 2017. However Handel advised that this time I would not be given any antibiotics because antibiotics are being over prescribed and we need to preserve for the next generation. When I questioned why I was treated with antibiotics before at Cypress Urgent he said I was given incorrect information before. Said he could give me a note to take off work. I left and went to see my PCP and sent the information to the CDC that Cypress Urgent care is preserving the world’s antibiotics supply.< /Text>< response>

Over all good experience. I love the online check in process, you have the online waiting list, tells you how many people are ahead of you so you don’t have to just sit in the lobby the whole time, but you just have to get in early, like most places the later you go in the longer you’ll likely have to wait. Not to mention Dr. Handley is hot lol< /text>

i don't want to give any star. I am strongly recommend NOT to go that Urgent care .because all the doctor are none knowledgeable and not take care at all. in fact, I had in-grow  toe nail  they don't even have a equipment and didn't give  me any treatment but they told me to come back and recheck up. That for what ? they any thinking about money beside all the reception counter ladies are very very rude because I told them to get my money back but they told me "I'll call police". That why if you go and see that Urgent care you will regret end up unsatisfying like me.So that it strongly my recommendation.<//text>

<text>I love this urgent care not only did they save my life back in 2017 but they have always helped me with everything from getting sick to getting injured. What I really like about this place is although I go alot they dont judge me for going so much and help me. Also, dr handle is a really good dr. Always listens to me and helps me out when I cant get in with my primary dr or even my dentist. I will be forever grateful and continue to give them service as well as recommend people to them. Thank you guys for everything I appreciate it.<//text>< pictures>

Went in for flu symptoms without an appointment and was seen promptly, treated respectfully, and given appropriate care and prescriptions. The nurse practitioner who saw me was pleasant, personable, and competent. My normal provider, Optimum Care, wouldn't even offer an appointment for more than a week since they were "all booked up."< /review>

<Review>I was referred to this urgent care because its within my insurance network. For a second, i was literally sad on hearing the name CYPRESS URGENT CARE. It's a terrible place to be trust me!!

Can you be more FAST, EFFICIENT AND KIND PLEASE? 3 years and still no improvement in service? Always slow, front desk staff is very rude. No courteous words (please, thank you). They literally talk as if they they are ordering you around. Service is SLOW. Doctors are unproffessional and rude.

I love MEDPOST Urgent care. I wish they are within my network. Referring me to this Cypress urgent care is like a death sentence. Oh my God!!! They are a total waste of money, time and effort.</Review>< pics>

Ive had to come here a few times and the staff has always been nice and the wait time isn't horribly long. You can even call ahead and they're polite enough to give you an estimated wait time if you ask. (Wait time as of then, of course it can change if more people show up before you get there)<//review>

<Date>1539657080370<//Date><rate>5< /rate><text>Had a tiny piece of clear glass in bottom of my foot. Doc and I agreed best chance was to put a small slice at the entry point and flush with water. No way to know if he got it out til later when anesthesia wore off.  Well, great job Doc, that very sharp, distinct pain is not there when I  walk or stand on that one foot.
My primary doctor with my insurance probably would've had to set me somewhere to get the same thing done in twice or three times the amount of time. Thanks again.</text>< Pics>

While the doctor and others who saw me were very good, I wanted to mention that Brandy, with whom I spoke on the phone and in person, was exceptionally accommodating. In addition to being very warm and personable, she went out of her way to check a sheet for a physical by letting me email it in to her before coming, and when I arrived she made sure that I got what I needed. Overall, I received great care.< /review>

I was very impress with the doctor and staff at this facility. I had a deep puncher wound  that needed to have glass removed and cleaned out. The staff was very professional and caring. This facility is better then some other places I have been  to. It is a real urgent care facilities rather than other places that are more of a doctors office then an urgent care.<//Text>

I have been using this urgent care for at least 5 years now!The front desk is always curteous.  Juan P. is almost always the next person that i see in the office.  He is amazing!  I have never met a more caring person at a doctors office before.  Especially an urgent care! The doctors here have never rushed me or been unfriendly.  I wish I could use this office for my primary care!!</text>

<Review>The staff was EXTREMELY unprofessional. Avoid this place

We took our son here it was closest Urgent care.  He had dislocated elbow, and he was in a lot of pain

Kari Hail nurse practitioner at UC
looked at it, she manipulated my son's arm and told us that  everything is ok it's back on the place and said it'd feel better in 15 minutes. And just I case she wants Xray. So they xrayed it. Said they couldn't see any breaks although there was a section they couldn't see properly which so they took another Xray it didn't show any breaks eater....
After our and more she told us that everything is good and my son still has fear and doesn't want to move hand. I told her that I know my son and he still in pain and I know I'm his mom. So she told me that She's a "doctor" and knows better!!!

After my husband talked to her she agreed try manipulation again. After that she gave as prescription and sent us home with crying baby. And told us to come in the morning if he will be in pain.

So eventually we came home with the possibility it had been dislocated but put back in place.
Kari Hail told us that he's just being protective and would wake in the morning having totally forgotten about it and would be fine.

He isn't. He woke up crying at night a lot and he didn't use his arm in the morning didn't want anything...

We called Urgent Care to ask what time we can come back? And guess what?!
Receptionist Joey asked wait on the line  so he can ask. After that he told us that Kari Hail advises go to ER. That she did everything she could what was Nothing!!! She did really nothing accept torching my baby and spending our time, money and energy.

Ended up taking him to another place back and saw a The doctor that had been in the profession, he took one look at him, manipulated his arm 'pop' (we all heard it) back in and immediately he lifted his arm to touch  some medical stuff on the wall...

Check review! Ask friends where to go if any issue.
Be healthy!<//Review>< Pics>

<Review>I've had to go a couple times. For kidney issues. The wait time was not bad. I was actually able to leave and come back. They held my spot. Staff was friendly. Liked the doctor had to go back. Due to lack of giving pain meds. Other then that. Good place to go if you want to skip the ER< /Review>< Pictures>

I called this location before I came in to see how long the wait would be. The lady tells me 2 hours. I uber down there and when I go to check in she tells me that the Dr on Duty is leaving at 3pm, it's now noon, when I get there. She says I can check in but it's going to be at least 3 hours and I'll have to leave and recheck in for the other doctor. This place needs to get their act together and not waste people's time!<//text>

Great doctor, reasonable waiting time and... incompetent receptionist who charged me full cost instead of co-payment!! After that it took significant effort to explain where they made a mistake. Now I have to wait more than 2 months to get a refund. In my opinion such errors should be corrected in the matter of days, not months so I submitted complaint to state board and BBB. Hopefully the receptionist will find a much more suitable job for her such as cleaning service.<//review>

I was very happy with the staff.  Juan especially tried his best to meet a specific need I had, and went above the call of duty.  The doctor listened to my concerns, and gave me medication I needed.  They don't like to prescribe much or give refills, as they want you to go to your primary care physician which is reasonable (imagine and addict going to multiple urgent cares in one week).

Came in for my child. Wait time was a bit excessive, but once we were in a room everyone was extremely courteous and professional. We were in and out of there in about 90 minutes after our name was called. I would give 5 stars, if the wait was shortened by hiring additional staff of same calibre.</Text>

<Review>I came in at 10am on sunday, I signed in and waited an hour then the girl at the front told me about this call back system where they text you minutes  before your appointment to come back so you don't have to wait. So at 12 they text me to come back my appointment  time is 12:30. It's now almost 2:30 and I'm still waiting there only 6 people in front of me when I first came in so in 4 hours this office was only able to see 6 patients?  Wow. I should have left but I'm to sick to drive around to different  urgent cares. I will never come back here again.< /Review>< Rating>

Please do not go to Cypress Urgent Care!!! Both the Receptionist and the Physician's assistant/Nurse was  unprofessional!! Horrible!! Rude!! and a Bully!!! Please read our experience!!

We rushed our 6 year old daughter after she accidentally had a candy that had peanut in it! When we walked in, the receptionist was on the phone, and the physician’s assistant was watching a game in the lobby. We stood there for a while, but none of them acknowledged us! And when I told her excuse me can my daughter please see a doctor! She was rude and kept on saying give me a second, give me second. When I again told her that it might be an emergency she’s having trouble breathing. This is her exact response “if it is an emergency then go to the ER, this is an urgent care! When I’m done with my phone then you will still need to fill out paper works before your daughter can see a doctor!”
The physician’s assistant was a bully and seemed to get irritated that his game was interrupted. He stood up and started yelling at us, saying I bet your daughter is fine! Then he slammed the door on us and took my daughter’s O2 count just for a split second. Yet when the doctor finally saw my daughter she immediately asked him to give her an epipen shot and told us to rush to the emergency room where she can be monitored.
We felt helpless, and extremely frustrated.< /Text><userid>104251264368362580748<//userid>< gmap_id>

They turned me down at 2:30 pm after I called to confirm they could take me.  Whoever was working at 2:30 pm on 12/26 at the front desk was rude and lacked compassion.  The girl with light green eyes had horrible bed side manner and was not interested in helping me and my sick daughter at all.  Very disappointed!<//Text>

I called them before going there because I live about 30 minutes away, but they were the only ones open till 10pm and my 7 year old had two fingers extremely swollen from a fall off of her bike and needed to see if they were broken. We got there at about 8 pm and were told that they closed at 8 but there hours said Sunday open till 10pm! I questioned the rude smart ass behind the counter and asked her why she didn't say that to me when I spoke to her before I drove 30 minutes to get there and she of course lied and said "you didn't talk to me" and she was the one who I spoke to on the phone!!!! I will never go there again and am looking into filing a complaint against them...very unprofessional, making their own hours when for some of us, Urgent care is our only option sometimes!!

I took my daughter in because her ears were hurting so bad she couldn't eat or drink without pain.I was also seen because I was still having issues after treatment from my doctor.We were in there for about 3 plus hours the NP we saw barely examined us and wrote me a perscription for cough medicine I did not need. Gave my daughter a script for a medicine she was allergic to and didn't correct it until halfway through the next day. So she h as d to suffer with the ear pain until that next night.< /review>

Very disappointed in the service this urgent care gives. Scheduling an appointment when they know the doctor wasn't gonna be in. The the blonde heavy set receptionist very rude when asked about when the doctor will be in next. The whole time all waiting rooms are full while the whole staff is huddled around the desk making jokes and laughing and a could careless attitude towards patients. Its unfortunate that these people get to work with people in need.<//text>

Absurd wait time. Took about an hour and a half even though there was one other person in the waiting room when we got there. The waiting room was very dirty and had weird looking stains on the chairs. We specifically had to ask about the results of the strep test. We were required to fill out paperwork and then the nurse asked all the exact same questions as soon as we got to the exam room. They did not send the prescription themselves but gave us a paper prescription that we had to take to the pharmacy. Then the doctor didn't properly fill out the prescription so it took another absurd amount of time because the pharmacy had to keep calling them back to get the doctor's name. wouldnt go back< /text>

This clinic is listed as a site that accepts Ambi, but when we got there this morning, the nurse rudely informed us that they have not taken Ambi for 5 months. Maybe update your clinics information and have yourself taken off as an Ambi friendly clinic then? We wasted our time, something that we can not get back, and quite frankly is money. My wife was on crutches with a serious injury. It is a chore for her to move around. We had to take a handy van to and from the site, for absolutely no reason. Complete waste of a morning. A little effort to update information impertinent to your clinic could have prevented this.<//text>

Very bad experience. I went in on 03/04/2015 the staff was EXTREMELY rude and  unprofessional. After 2 weeks I received a bill in the mail for $28 even though I paid the full amount before I left and when I called to ask about this the lady that answered was rude and unprofessional after she transferred me without even telling me I was being transferred they waived the $28 charge. The funny part is that I live in cypress and I was discussing this with my neighbor and he had worse experience than mine about a year ago. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE.<//review>

We had a patient treated at Cypress Urgent Care.  They were pleased overall.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  The wait time was less than 15 mins. The Doctor was thorough and assessed B.C.'s condition within a few mins.  We would recommend Cypress Urgent Care.

<Response>{'time': 1546273824756, 'text': "Hi Sam - We looked at our records and absolutely did not have a five hour wait at anytime over the last several weeks - if ever at this clinic.  Cypress' staff is certainly caring and extremely competent so I feel like perhaps you wrote this review in error?  Maybe you were seen at a different urgent care?  We didn't have any Sam Gs in our patient database, either unfortunately.  Regardless, we wish you the best in health  and are here if you need us in the future!"}</Response><Time>1546280661704<//Time>< review>
