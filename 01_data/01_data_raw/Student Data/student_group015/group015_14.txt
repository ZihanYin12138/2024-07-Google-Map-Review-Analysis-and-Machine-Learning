<review>Our room was downstairs and apparently the upstairs guest lived there with kids and a dog. They were very noisy. Barking, bumping and constant door closing almost all night.

Positive: Location was fine. Negative: Room wasn't really that clean, lots of hair all over the place. Needs to be updated, shower head leaked, towels falling apart. No sheer shades on the curtains to allow light without being seen from the outside, missing artwork. Hallway smelled of diapers.< /Text>

<review>The room was spacious, had a kitchenette that was usable, and the bed was comfortable.  The TV had a little issue with the "guide" wherein you couldn't get back to it after using it on the initial start-up of the TV - you could then only scroll through the channels.  So that was unfortunate.  But, we made the best of that.  Things were OK overall - even tho' we occasionally had to avoid guests who weren't wearing their masks - that was annoying and I think the hotel staff should've been more vigilant re: that.</review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

I paid $22 for internet per week and speed was like 4 mbps and kept getting disconnected. Too much for too little. Other motels around offer free 50mbps steady internet. Also the blanket was ROUGH man. Also ventilation isn't good there so people's kitchen always Makes the hallways smell for hours like a restaurant. Other than that it was ok.</text>

Seems this place has a bad history of the same problems: checked us into an unfinished room with a jar of open pickles on the counter, no bed linens, and the countertop and cabinets peeling off. The lobby is cramped, it smells lousey, doors and hallways are scratched and worn. This place is beaten on. Not even a coffee maker - and there is no coffee in walking distance. I’m tired of hearing service industry blame “current circumstances” for the fact they’re not running places worth a darn.</Review>

Hotel smelled strongly of Marijuana despite the no smoking rules. Was told at the time of booking that they would have cribs available only to find out at checkin that they do not provide cribs or pack and plays. No coffee pots in rooms because there is too much theft, but are not able to provide them for all of their guests. There were a lot of "quick fixes" that were not safe for children. Not worth your money for an overnight or weekend stay.<//text>

The rooms stunk, the carpet had a lot of stains, the bedding had stains and between sheet was full of hair.  We asked for clean bedding but never got it.  The check in process was unbelievable yesterday slow.  I would not go here ever.  It is not clean and during Covid that makes it even worse.< /Review>

Noticed blood or wine stain on bed sheet and pubic hair stuck to bathroom door, this was after work and there was no one at the front desk to help...luckily I packed Clorox wipes and Lysol spray.

Positive: It was centrally located to restaurants and stores. Negative: The original room we were placed in was dirty, looked like someone had just checked out 5 minutes before.  All the lights were on, tv was on, shower curtain open, stains on top cover of bedding, drawers and cabinets all open with crumbs inside.<//Review>

Positive: Kitchen utensils and room was ok Negative: This hotel is worst for bath towels. Given bath towels were too short and too old and smells bad. Threads were coming out when used after the bath.    They should change the bath towels and give good quality big towels for bath<//Text>

Positive: Value and kitchen Negative: Terrible, unusable free WiFi.  You can upgrade To an enhanced paid version of the Wi-Fi which may be better.  The free version however is completely useless.  Also no plates cups or silverware in the kitchen but thatâ€™s to be expected I guess.</text>

I have a hard time believing they did not haveI’ve machines in the entire hotel. We had to go out several times throughout the weekend to pick up ice! Also, as much as I appreciate doggy friendly environments I was disgusted as to how much poop I saw around the hotel. Come pet lovers, we could do better in keeping up with our pups, but also the hotel did not have bags in the posts and no clean up aroundComplex. It was definitely a blah stay for me, would not recommend unless it’s your last resort. Sorry Extended Stay but that’s a two dumbs down!!!<//Text>

-1) cleanliness was not the best. The glass doors all had hand prints and during this pandemic crisis, I’d expect to see CLEAN handles. -1) it’s up to date with its technology features, but safety wise, it’s not. Compared to other hotels that require your room card to access the hotel from any entrance, Anyone was able to access the hotel since the doors were unlocked. -1) the cleanliness of the room should be far superior than the lobby, but it seems like they have the same expectation as their lobby. The bed was poorly and lazy made. By lazy I mean all sheets, blanket and “duvet” folded together to the top. The shower had an awful lot of hair stuck on the drain. The room has a humid smell and the hallways reeked of fried chicken from the time I checked in to my check out. -1) price. For the price, I’d expect at least a decent clean.< /text>

Corporate must remodel Palm Springs, CA. Pay extra for high speed internet which is unheard of even at Motel 6!  My television is not operational and Corporate doesn't allow them to call repair companies. Vending? Machine removed because it was broken months ago so no vending at all. Popcorn ceilings, really?  FOLKS, STAY AWAY FROM HERE. I already paid TripAdvisor for 4 nights soooooo, and Extended Stay will not reimburse anyone.</review>

The door entry to building did not work had to walk in the heat to find a door that worked. Noticed exterior side walks were filthy. They did not have an ice machine, blow dryer or coffee maker. In the evening we spotted a homeless person showering in the pool area. The room was clean the air conditioning unit worked poorly. We were on the ground floor which was quite noisy.

It was one of the worst we planned to go and relax by the pool the pool was closed no ice machines no cups in the room you had to walk down to the front desk to get a coffee maker with only one bag for one cup of coffee then we go to get the dishes and we get one cup and one glass I called the front desk and ask for more and they said they didn’t have any at this time we had to walk across the street and down the street to get ice there was no free breakfast like they said on the site there was no pool there was no ice machine I had to drive to a Store to get a glass another cup or mug for coffee buy coffee or tea the sink wouldn’t let the water go down it went very slow so the plumbing wasn’t good no patio or balcony to sit outside they should explain that because of Covid they are limited and that the pool is closed this was $166 a night and was worse then a motel front desk was not Courteous nor did they bother to help we had to keep going up and down the elevator to get everything from the front desk I would never stay there again< /Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>They saved our anniversary by working their magic to get us a room. All the other hotels in the area were booked so if we didn't get this one we would of had a 2 hour drive back home. Did I mention that Quality Inn almost messed it up by allowing us to make a reservation at a closed hotel. Shame on them. 😡 Extended Stay Palm Springs had a nice clean room and kitchenette. The one thing I would suggest though is a bit better continental breakfast. But other than that our experience was great. 😊😊 Thank you to the folks there for helping us out. 😊<//Text>< pictures>

<Text>Today, 03/04/19, I arrive at this hotel AND THE RESERVATION was CANCELED!!!  I did not cancel it.  I have an email confirming my reservation.  The manager did not even talk to me. I had to call their main number and watched the manager talk to the lady I spoke to.   As I sat in the lobby, I herd 3 other reservations where also cancelled!  Be ware!!!

1 out of 5 star for lack of professionalism and courtesy.  Also as I sat there...I noticed...not a very clean place.</Text>< pics>

The aircondition is making noise and its only set to 72 which is still really warm inside. The check in process is not effecient as i was told to wait in the lobby then all of a sudden fred (frontdesk) started to entertain guest to check in without calling me as first in the line.kinda disappointing especially it was really hot and u really wanted to get a shower and take a nap after long drive .<//review>

<Name>Ed Walsh< /Name><review>This may not be the hotel's fault but on Web sites such as Priceline, it very prominently advertises itself as having a free grab and go breakfast.  That is one of the reasons why I booked the hotel over others.  But when I got to the hotel, it said it was suspended because of COVID.    On the positive side, the hotel is clean.  I noticed a few stains on my bed sheet but it looked like the stains were not fresh, but just didn't come out in the wash.  Just to be sure, I slept on the side of the bed where the stains weren;t. Someone had obviously been smoking in the room, it smelled a little like smoke and there were burn marks all over the sink from where someone rested a cigarette.    On the positive side, the front desk clerk couldn't have been nicer or more efficient.  The hotel is in a convenient area.< /review></record></dataset><record>

<user_name>Life as We make it</user_name>< Review>
If I could put zero or negative stars I would. I had a horrible experience and so did a friend of mine! First they told us they couldn't confirm the payment for our booking and had us pay for a night and then the next day it was the same story and they refused to even look at our confirmation number claiming that they couldn't contact their manager when they didn't even try. Then the next day they were giving us more of the same story until we contacted our booking agency who tried faxing and emailing them the confirmation over and over. They told us they weren't getting any faxes or emails until we had the booking company call them directly with us standing right there, then OH MAGICALLY ALL THE FAXES AND EMAILS WERE THERE. we just got a different hotel. Don't even get me started on what they did to my friend. They double booked his room and then called the police when he showed them his reservation and his confirmation stating they didn't know who he was even though he clearly had the key to the room. Then after the police were given the evidence they tried to apologize. The staff there are VERY incompetent and extremely rude. I would suggest booking somewhere else.</Review>

< review>
I booked through Price Line on the express deal, it was supposed to be a 70% good rating...Very disappointed, the parking lot was dirty, trash all over. The common areas of the hotel were poorly maintained, the carpets were dirty and not vacuumed. The room was not cleaned very well, there were hairs in the tub and sink, the toliet paper roll was empty, there were gunky chunks on the wall of unknown origin, all in all this wasn't a very clean or comfortable place...the elevator was simply... disgusting. Don't say you weren't warned! It's too bad with a little effort this could be a decent place.</review>

To everyone who is commenting on this property maybe it would be better served to write the corporate offices because every person working are under tremendous difficulty due to no support from the top. It should really have the "Trump" stamp of approval & then most people would not be so critical. When corporations only care about capturing the revenue & not providing any maintenance budget then this is why I believe so many properties in this area are all run down. In addition, during the months from January to May the prices sometimes escalate to five times due to the high end events without any improvements because the practice has been prolifically unchecked. Tourism is the name of the game & as long as "money talks" nothing will change. Write to the new CEO & maybe things could change.<//text>

<review>Very odd experience. This is an extended stay motel that is supposed to have a fully equipped kitchen. When we got there there was nothing in the kitchen. Virtually nothing. We didnt even have any glasses. I called down to the desk and they told me that they didnt stock the kitchens unless something was requested. They didnt mention to me that there were plastic cups in the bathroom hidden behind the Kleenex.Checking in was difficult because no one could find a front desk clerk. There was a trainee there working, but he didnt know how to do some of the check-in processes.The motel itself is fairly noisy. You can hear individuals talking through the walls and also walking up and down on the floors above you.The room itself was not in bad shape. The paint was fairly new and it had decent Carpeting and Flooring.All in all, a very odd experience.<//review><gmapID>0x80db1b9c0677e01f:0xcc32607de6ab2cb5< /gmapID><Resp>None< /Resp><Rating>None< /Rating></record></dataset><record>

This was a horrible hotel! They checked guests into my room while I was at work. I came back to find drug people in my room and all my stuff & my partners gone through and about 3/4 of my stuff was missing !! The GM did nothing but say “Sorry that happened to you but there’s nothing we can do” this is bulls**t. Don’t every rent from this hotel. They are so negligent here it’s disgusting. I had precious items and valuables worth quite a bit of money in my room. Now I’m put at an inconvenience and they won’t even refund me any money for the 2 nights I was here.<//Text>

No help with getting a sink unclogged, we called 30 mins after checking in to let them know that it was clogged. The only remedy we got was a plunger. That i had to unclogged my self.  Not staying here ever again, stay away from this hotel.< /Review>

This place looks nice from the outside but once you walk in it's a different story. They are not equipped with enough staff, front desk person looks stressed and rushed he explains everything and does not give you eye contact. We asked for towels to go to the pool and they were old and ripped, the pool looked dirty, the water was cloudy so I'm sure it has not been cleaned. The room had a wired smell when we walked in, and the AC was pretty loud. This is not a nice place to stay in, this was our first and last time here.< /text>

Booked through Priceline 4 nights without knowing how the place was, well when I first got there I thought it was a motel a lot of homeless looking people like a place welfare would get for low income people, since I was moving from California to Arizona some one broke into my car and took everything I mean everything I made a police report and contacted the manager but she never return my calls after many attempts the place smells like weed and people smoke right out the door so smoke comes inside, don’t don’t don’t stay here and if you do watch your car and belongings, my biggest regret is staying there.....<//review>

<review>I received a notice from my landlord that my unit tested positive for mold and that I would have to relocate for 3-4 weeks!! This was with a 2 day notice! I know scary right, and stressful enough. Sadly the management company was trying to charge each apartment for staying in a hotel. I arrived this past Tuesday to the property and was helped by an awesome Front Desk Agent who made 2 reservations one for me and another for an elderly disabled marine veteran who is suffering from cancer currently and his dog. I took the information back to the management company and the owner and all hotels were over $3,000 because of an event in town for Feb and another in March. I was stunned but with the help of fair housing and my attorney we were able to get the owners to pay for our stay and I arrived the next day to verify with Manager Ms. Brandee and she was the nicest person I have ever had the pleasure of dealing with. She was considerate, kind and heartfelt as she heard the issues we were facing. She showed me several rooms to help me feel comfortable with my transition into a hotel from a two bedroom apartment and I have to say I will be arriving tomorrow morning for the next 3-4 weeks knowing I am in a nice clean safe space because of the incredible assistance Ms Brandee provided. I am confident all will work out as she has a staff who have been caring and kind from every interaction I have had with them. This hotel clearly has done the correct thing by hiring the staff they've hired and they should be commended for such amazing customer service. Thank you from my heart Ms Brandee for such amazing service and for your kind assistance in making this temporary transition a better one.< /review>< pics>

Room was clean, if a bit worn. Plenty of parking. Check in was easy. Internet was good. Full kitchen in my room, but completely empty cabinets, so if you want to cook, bring your own dishes. Walls are thin. The morning coffee and snack service was very basic.</text>

<Text>I recommended this hotel to family. The rooms were decent, but we didn't feel safe. There were non-guests jumping in the pool with clothes on (jeans and shirts), drugs being sold openly at the pool while my children swam and played. The hotel staff did not call the police, even when asked. Leaving through one of the side doors for dinner, we encountered a couple sitting by the door with pills and knives. Definitely do not recommend this hotel.< /Text>< gmapID>

<Review>I did not get to stay at this hotel, I am only reviewing because of my experience with the staff.
I was supposed to get a free night but the only way to redeem that was online. By the time I had Internet, the hotel was full and closed online saying they had no availability. So we went in to see if they could at the very least give me a discount and we would pay for the last room. The manager said the best she could do was like $7 dollars off. Doing the math, that was not even a 5% discount, and I know for a fact that they can at the VERY LEAST offer at 15% discount. I was highly offended seeing as the room was supposed to be free to me and they were less than helpful. Just to put it into perspective, the nicest hotel in the area the night I needed was the Renaissance hotel and their rate was $279. This last room was $266. So I could've stayed in a 5 star hotel for what they wanted for this last room. And they claimed there was absolutely nothing they could do. Complete bs. Very rude staff. Not helpful or considerate people.</Review>< Pics>

Positive: With over 30 years of personal hotel experience, I must say that this hotel is defined by the people that work here. This is a wonderful, caring, hard-working local staff. They are individually and collectively impressive. Negative: Corporate pricing does not allow for employee empowerment. Clearly this is a tool that would allow more flexibility and potentially more profit. An onsite salesperson for group and individual corporate contracts would secure higher revenue and occupancy.<//review>

Windows and doors to the rooms do not block out sound sufficiently. Was woken up at 2 am by a person in the parking lot on their phone  smoking right outside the window. Was also woken up later that morning by people talking very loudly while grabbing their coffee. So my advice is do not accept a room in the hallway adjacent to the lobby. The room we stayed in was clean. Average experience .</Review>

The Rockies form a dramatic backdrop at all times of day, and they have coffee in the morning. If you're a hotel snob and must have the best, look elsewhere. But if you want a place to get you moving around Palm Springs, it's great. Near the major shopping district and the future site of a cultural museum.< /Review>< Pics>

There was no one at the front desk when we arrived to check in. There was a sign saying to call a number if no one was present. We did that repeatedly. After about 20', we left. There were other parties waiting also. We came back about an hour later and someone was present. I described what had happened on our first visit - no apology given.</Review>

<Text>I pulled in the parking lot and saw Fords, and Chevys, and low end Nissan, and I thought, I fit in a lot better here than I did at the Riviera. If you ain't frickin rich, but you want to come out to the West Coast and spend some time this is a really nice place to stay. I highly recommend this to anybody that's middle class or lower coming to California. This is a very nice Motel.<//Text><Gmap_id>0x80db1b9c0677e01f:0xcc32607de6ab2cb5< /Gmap_id>< Time>

This hotel will be my number 1 choice next time I stay in Palm Springs. Staff was super friendly and professional. Arron was so nice and amazing! Loved that you couldn’t hear noise from the rooms around us. Great location! great price, compared to hotel on the other side of the parking lot. Will be coming back here again! :)<//review>

I'd rate this hotel a 3 out of 5. On the outside, it's a gorgeous looking hotel on a nice street. Reception was friendly and helpful. The room was nice, king bed with a kitchen. Pool was really nice, good patio... No complaints there. However, our whole hotel floor (3rd floor) just smelled like marijuana... A lot. Wreaked. Also, the "free breakfast" was granola bars and packaged muffins, so I hope people aren't counting on feeding their children breakfast here.
It was a good price, but the smell really ruined the experience.<//text>

Their posted "Breakfast" hours do not matter. You show up thinking you will be able to get something. NOPE! If you are not there when things are put out, you wont get anything. Like they only put out enough for 10 people. 8am everything is gone. Why advertise if you dont honor what you advertise?</text>

Rooms were dirty and had that sweet smell of room freshener like they were trying to cover something up. The sweet smell was so strong I moved rooms. Second room was no better. cigarette burns all over counters in the bathroom (non smoking room) fridge sounded like it was going to explode. Air conditioner would only run for 3 min and shut off. It is 108 outside. For an extended stay there was nothing in the rooms, not even cups for water. Had to ask for everything including hair driers. Stayed one night out of the 6 I was booked for and left.<//text>

They gave me a key to an occupied room number 100 and I walked in on a man with his pants down. I said I'm sorry and backed out of there as quick as I could and I was sure glad that I didn't get shot. Told the clerk about it and seems like all they could do is make it funny. Nothing funny about that a person could get killed.<//Review>

<username>Spring Power<//username><Review>The receptionist was friendly and helpful.
And talking about good things, that's it. Okay, it's not far from downtown. So I give 2 stars.

If you have no urging reasons (cheap, everything else booked) don't go there.
They do not invest in sufficient staff. The included breakfast is just wrapped muffins and cereal bars or oatmeal. Not even milk as I recall. The checkout took 12 minutes sice the receptionist had also to take care of the pool are. There are long term guests. They look for the price. But do not expect any great service.< /Review><GmapID>0x80db1b9c0677e01f:0xcc32607de6ab2cb5< /GmapID><rating>2</rating>< UserId.>

This place has terrible service. They over book their rooms and don't accommodate you in anyway. You pay for one thing and they give you something else. Three is no communication with in the company. I called to confirm I had a room admit fifteen minutes before I got there was toned that I would. Got there and was told that I didn't have a room and that they have been booked for more then an hour and no one would have told me that there was a room. Called customer service who called the hotel and some how a room opened up. I paid for a king sized bed but got a queen. There was no credit or apology for the issue.</Review>

This is a perfectly fine place to stay, but nothing really amazing. Nice room with a semi-full kitchen (you need to request pots, pans, etc if you want to use them). The kitchen has no sponge, and when I asked for one, the front desk person looked at me like I asked for him to come wash my dishes for me...I was also surprised that this place doesn't have any sort of workout/exercise room; kinda figured that was standard these days. In spite of those things, it's a fine place to stay.</Text>

I recommended family stay here during a week-long trip. We visited with them twice and deeply regret suggesting this hotel. Drug deals were going on poolside with children at the pool, non-guests loitering by entryways, people fixing their vehicles in the lot. We felt unsafe and had family switch hotels after 2 nights.< /Review>

<text>Booked room, checked in.  They had me wait while they cleaned it.  The beds looked messy/sloppy made.  The sink was clogged, slow to drain. The toilet got clogged just from toilet paper.  Called operator. They brought a plunger and said good luck! Their breakfast is tiny muffins and coffee.. for the price VERY disappointed!<//text>< userid>

If you like meth or crack, need a place to crash. This is for you. Disgusting. Had to have priceline refund me after fleeing. Pretends to be something it's not, normal middle class.<//review>

<Review>One of my favorite places to stay .. I have now entered into an agreement with Gov Partners and we would like to fund a renewable energy Strategy with extended stay  and also other HOTELS as a Task force Climate change, we are also hoping to be back soon  and see the General Manager and provide the details.  This is a great place to stay. Excellent Location

< Review>
1. Staff very friendly: Brandee, Erika, Bill, Tim, Danira (new GM) [Front desk]; Maria, Val [housekeeping]; Rigo [maintenance]. (I don't know all the names.)
2. Excellent hot water - for shower, shaving, dishwashing.
3. Traveling w/ dog? Lots of people who travel w/ their pet stay here.
4. In-room AC & heater both work fine & quickly. (It can be quite chilly at night in PS in the wintertime.)
5. Wifi (basic) is fine. I do email, online newspapers frequently on it. YouTube, sports online streaming generally works well.
6. TV: Screen is small, but works well. They have Dish satellite basic pkg. You get, e.g., the 3 local PS traditional broadcast stations; CNN, Fox, several ESPN, etc. About 30 total. That's plenty. Nobody actually needs 200 cable channels!
7. Room has a small, but really quite workable mini-kitchen. Lg fridge w/ freezer. 2 electric "burners." Microwave. Plenty of storage space. As I said above, great hot water. No oven, unfortunately. (Some long-stay guests bring their own counter-top roaster.) No, it's not your kitchen at home, but you can do lots of basic cooking here, plus, of c., it's cheaper than eating out. Front desk has plates, pots, "silver," etc. - kind of mix & match! If you're staying here more than a night or 2, & you like to cook, I'd suggest bringing your own covered 2- or 3-qt pot, plus a deep, covered fry pan, + your must-have basic utensils.
8. Large # of electrical outlets for device-charging.
9. Easily walkable: Rite-Aid pharm. & mini-grocery; Italian deli w/ wonderful bread; 99-Cent Store = (basically) a grocery + dime-store. ¤ Walkable: Starbucks; Koffi in great PS Mid-Century-style bldg.; Ralph's (lg supermarket); CVS; 2 great bakeries; a # of restaurants.
10. Wonderful views from some of the rooms, + just outside hotel: S. Jacinto Mtns to W & S. Either walk W a bit (to get around Marriott) or 1/2 bl. E (Tahquitz & Sunrise). Great for pics!<//Review>

We were there for one night to ride the Tour de Palm Springs so we weren't looking for anything fancy. I loved having the kitchen so I could eat breakfast before attempting to ride the 100 miles that day but other than kitchen the room had nothing but soap. This hotel had to frills at all. The only thing they supplied was toilet paper, hand soap and dish soap. For what we were doing there it wasn't a big deal but if you are staying the weekend make sure to pack the basic stuff the most hotels supply like shampoo and a hair dryer. There was a small stain on my sheet too but it looked like something that the wash machine couldn't get out. YUCK. The people behind the counter were very nice and the grounds seemed pretty clean.</Text>

<Review>3 km distance from airport.Good rooms tv, not so pro staff.They wanted to help, but have no so good experience.Wifi speed was ok, but we connect hard.Problems with taxi in the night. And the water have small pressure.But the price was good for a place like Palm Spring.< /Review>< gmap_id>

<text>We didn't actually stay. Thank goodness we were able to leave. We were staying this Easter weekend just for one night with our kids. You walk in and it stinks. We get to our room and every light and cabinet was on/open and the TV was on. It smelled so bad like weed. We ask to be moved. The manager apparently found a room and we went to the room. Door was open and one bed wasn't made. Switch to a third room. Go in and it smells. Use the restroom and the half roll of toilet paper was sitting on the dirty shelf below the sink. The bathtub had stains and was so gross. Went down to cancel and leave. There was an animal control personnel coming in to pick up some sort of an animal. A weirdo from Coachella asking if there were any socks in the lost and found, as he was barefoot. Three police officers and one transport van in the parking lot. I did not feel safe here and it was just gross. For the price, it's seriously not worth it.<//text>< gmapID>

The service was great, the person at the check in counter was nice. The room was clean and better than expected. The location was a little far off downtown Palm Springs but there were stores and restaurants really near by if you needed anything.</Text>

We stayed at the extended stay America Palm springs for our honeymoon.
And I must say this place is a little hidden jewel in the desert
Not only do they have all the Fabulous amenities that the extended stay is known for but as a bonus they have a pool...
The rooms are huge, clean, and comfortable.
I felt safe and secure
Don the manager is an awesome guy
Very pleasant and friendly
The staff is amazing , very pacient and accommodating, and knowledgeable
I wouldn't stay anywhere else
And I would definitely be recommending this extended stay to my friends and family
Absolutely a 10 accross the bord</Review>

<user>118139506792243332461</user><Text>We booked at this hotel because it was advertised to have a kitchen in the room. It has a 2 burner stove top, sink and microwave but ZERO cooking equipment, ZERO utensils, ZERO plates or bowls or cups, ZERO washcloth or towels to do dishes in the room. We asked for equipment so we could prepare our food and a thrown together assortment of a few utensils 1 skillet, 2 weirdly shaped plates and 2 bowls and cups with a dishdrainer were brought. The chair at the table was broken and EVERYTIME someone sat in it, it would lower, rapidly, to its lowest position and upon standing it would raise itself violently and bounce on the floor. The plumbing was all calcified with leaks in the shower. Cupboard pulls weren't attached correctly and screws were missing. The shelving in the closet was hanging loose one one side because the screw and drywall anchor were pulled from the wall and the shelf was not stable. Daily room service was not provided and thus it was very difficult to keep the room clean after trying to prepare food in an essentially non-existent kitchen. The linoleum "wood paneled" flooring was raised in areas and debris from previous visitors was trapped in the spaces under the flooring. The refrigerator froze all of our produce, ruining it. There was no hairdryer available. For the price I paid for this reservation I don't expect 5 stars but it should at least have was was advertised. I prepare 100% of the food my family eats and rely on getting a room with a useable kitchen. If I wanted to rough it, I'd have gone camping.< /Text>< gmapID>

<Review>What annoys me is that I wanted to play a game on my Xbox or watch Netflix without it having to stop to load the show, so I payed the $4 and some change to get thier enhanced wifi. Spent over an hour calling this tech support number to finish getting the better wifi. I called 7 times and sat on the phone for about 5 mins each time to get nothing, all I got was some music for when you are put on hold. Went to the front desk to ask for help and get told nothing they can do on thier end have to talk with the tech support.< /Review>< pictures>

This is the second time that I have stayed at this hotel. The best part of this hotel is the staff. They always provide great service and are very helpful.</review>

Lobby entrance walkway is dark at night. The hotel lobby was hot and stuffy. The elevator smelled like cigarettes.  Our room chair is gross and covered with glitter and stains. It is an extended stay hotel, but with no kitchen ware. You have to request everything. Btw, our room telephone doesn't work.<//review>

<Review>We paid for a non smoking room and it stated on the room that is was non smoking but it smelled horrible in the room. When I went to the front desk the woman told me that there was strict rules to not put anyone in that room. Ugh!! She moved me to another room and the remote for one of the TVs did not work. I call front desk and she said she would look one. She never called me back. On my way out to dinner i stopped at the front desk and she said oh yeah i have one here. The hotel smelled in the hallway and the front lobby was crappy. the breakfast was a joke. I was a joke!!!! I left after just one night. I was in town for a swim meet and was not surprised to find out that there were several, SEVERAL others that had same or worse problems. One family had roaches in their room.  Everyone from our team except for one family moved to another hotel.</Review><Gmap_id>0x80db1b9c0677e01f:0xcc32607de6ab2cb5< /Gmap_id><user>114138199668467053099< /user><pics>None< /pics><resp>None<//resp>< time>

Checked into our rooms and within the first 10  minutes we'd found several roaches in our room. The lamp shades were covered in eggs, ceilings had a noticeable gap where it met the wall. In the other room we found more young roaches and one large roach along with mouse droppings in the cupboard. Definitely not worth the price, I'd advise going to the Marriott next door as it's substantially cleaner and the staff is far more professional.< /Review>

<Review>Strong smell of smoke. My room was dirty when I arrived (full trash can from previous guest, hairs everywhere, toilet dirty inside). My windows were unlocked (first floor room, seems like a safety concern). I woke up the first night to people shouting at 2 am and constantly heard dogs barking in rooms throughout the stay.

Staff is friendly, but I still won’t be returning.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

-CRAPPY STAFF
-ROOM HAS NO AMENITIES ( YOU HAVE TO ASK FOR EVERYTHING, INCLUDING BATH TOWELS!)
-A/C DID NOT WORK IN THE 115 DEGREE WEATHER
-POOL HAD BEEN BROKEN FOR 3 WEEKS!
WILL NOT BE STAYING HERE AGAIN!<//Text>

Bad experience 😖
The room was dirty, the bathroom was not useful, there were holes in the wall, there were not enough towels in the bathroom, there were people complaining about everything, drunken people. ☹️</Review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Good place to stay. All clean and nice mountain view and frendly.
A good place to stay for a weekend with family or couple. Very clean and a perfect view and very friendly at the reception. I recommend it.

<Text>This place is really good! So many options and really good drinks. There is a variety on boba and lychee too! 😃👏 The food is good, but the kitchen has been closed for a while. 😢 The other thing is, the line wait and how long you have to wait to get your drink. I understand though because so many people go there. I recommend everyone goes there. I wish they had a boba tea emoji though!!!😂😋</Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPIAf1WJGouRJtBPJhtBvw90D77lQcIrhqO0oYd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x808ff20b564b9117:0x7e3eedd55b92dbd4<//Gmap_id></record>

<Review>Very nice !  First time to a tea spot in San Ramon and found it to be quick & easy. Located very near the bike/walking path - Iron Horse Trail in the shopping center with the Walmart.  Also plenty of parking if you're not walking or biking.
For us, it was the payoff for walking 4K. Smoothie for me, green tea latte for her.
We came back the next day and tried a few snacks - The fried squid, the fried popcorn chicken and the puffs w/red bean.  Everything was tasty. The fried stuff was a bit salty for me. The red bean seemed almost non present except for the color. Of course, this was our first try for snacks in any tea spot and that might be the general standard.
I like this location for its convenience to the path. There is no bike parking in front but there is a few spots at the trail point across - 70 paces approx.  Tthere are a few chairs and 2 small tables in front.
Service was polite, professional and prompt.
I'll visit again when I'm in San Ramon.< /Review><Response>None< /Response></record>

<review>Its a subpar milk tea franchise. better than places like Quickly but doesn’t come close to the quality and taste of other local spots like Teaspoon, Boba guys, and boba bliss. The slightly cheaper prices at t4 don’t equate to better value compared to the other shops. Their milk tea is a step up from the food colored syrup “milk tea” spots but don’t mistake them as premium< /review>< gmap_id>

<review>During this pandemic, T4 was a lifeline for a fast and quick boba. I've been having really strong boba cravings lately and just need an easy (and safe) solution every so often to fulfill the craving.

I call and order my milk tea with boba, and it's ready to be picked up in 5 minutes. To keep everything sanitized and remote, the workers are productive and do well. I feel very comfortable going in and grabbing my boba and leaving for 2 seconds! As for the consistency, the tasting of boba is always a little watered down, but it's not that big of a deal. I certainly can't thank T4 enough when I need them for being there!!!< /review>< date>

<text>Got the amber boba. The pearls were hard in the middle which was unpleasant. The milk tea flavor was okay. I liked my boyfriend's drink, milk tea with coffee jelly. The jelly flavored the tea well, so it tasted like coffee. Overall, good for satisfying the craving but wouldn't go out of my way to get it.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

<review>T4 is the equivalence of the father in bubble tea. What I like about t4 is their consistency of  being able to make the same teas and food with no flaws. Everything that’s created in t4 equally tastes as good as it in other places. I just wish the place was cleaner.<//review>< pictures>

I normally get ice cream or cream but they didn't have much options. Their kitchen is under reservation so I couldn't try anything but it all sounded good and their were a lot of options.

The drink isn't very sweet. I got it standard thinking it would be sweet enough since they have a lower option. It's not the best milk tea I've had but not terrible either. I'll drink it but I won't come back if I have another option.

My friend ordered a drink but was given the wrong one. They quickly fixed that and was very nice. Their customer service was great!<//Text><user_id>100704993977458284746<//user_id>< Rating>

<review>had their typical bubble tea. $3.75 for a big cup. Not bad. It tastes good, just not as excellent.

I always find that Arco is more cheaper then other gas stations. But I've also noticed that if you drive alot, back and fourth to certain places. You'll find yourself putting gas in your car more then 2 times. Up to you really.<//text>

<Text>Doesn't accept credit cards, only cash or debit. That makes sense if you are a Mom & Pop restaurant or store. However, ARCO is a big company, step into today and join us in modernization ARCO. How many customers and possible future guests did you turn away because you can't accept their money?< /Text><Time>1508916821577</Time></record></dataset><record>

Great little park. You blink you might miss it.  Cool little play place for the kiddies and two full court b-ball courts. Tables were a little dirty but those can be covered. Bathrooms were decent for a public park.< /Review>

Very nice park, really low key. Always clean and have a nice basketball court. Some days, you’ll find undesirables sitting around the benches (not to worry, they won’t bother you). My son loves this park!< /Review>

I like the park because is a nice place but the only think that I don't like is because is a bunch of people homeless they are drinking beer and doing drugs that make the park unsafe. Police need to be around sometimes to protect the place and watch all that  kind of people.< /Review>

<Text>Santa Clara city library at the Central Park location has curbside pickup which I found very useful. I was impressed with the traffic management the crew had set up. I arrived on my bicycle and waited in the walk-up line. When it was my turn I showed them my card. I was offered a grab bag option like mystery or young adult. All in all it was a very smooth experience. I recommend watching the video they've posted on the library's website ahead of time just so you know what you're getting into.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

I am so grateful that the librarians are working during our time of covid.  I have read many books over the last 8 months which brought me happiness and remind me of the joy in life.    Thank you!< /text>

Wonderful studying and working environment: clean restroom and plenty of seats with sockets. I like that there’s a mini cafe on the first floor! During weekdays, it’s not too challenging to find parking.< /review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>Really clean and comfortable place with a lot of natural light to study and read. Quiet study is my favorite area to work.
There are a lot of events for kids and I also heard in broadcast that they have some “dancing event” :)
Only thing I want to complain is that the Wifi is not stable sometimes.<//review><name>Winter W< /name>< date>

The decor of the building itself is very inviting, and spacious with lots of separate spaces to sit and work across the two floors. There is a small used books section which sells paperbacks at 75 cents and a passable Cafe at the back.

Peaceful environment. Had a variety of books selections and got various categories.Organized and the books were not dusty. I always come here to read some books and sometimes bring my brother with me for him to study.<//Text>

<Date>1570637086948</Date><rate>5< /rate><Review>Best library in the area, in my opinion.  Clean, quiet, well-lighted, well-staffed, spacious, with plenty of computers and plenty of comfortable places to sit (a godsend on hot Summer days, when one needs a quiet place to cool off.)  The small section with tables, where one may eat a lunch, is also nice (I only wish it had more tables, as they fill up quickly.)  The library is also relatively free from unnecessary distractions (such as noisy crazy people), unlike, say, the Sunnyvale Library.  The "Quiet Nook" is another excellent feature of this library, one which I sincerely wish other libraries would adopt:  A nice, quiet, secluded little room by itself with desks equipped with privacy-hutches, and kept mercifully-quiet, for those times when one needs to work free from noise & distractions.  Other useful resources available at this library as well, such as scanners, copiers, etc.  All in all, an excellent library, one which is my first choice for virtually all my library needs.  The only real criticism I can make is the fact that the parking is really not adequate to the needs of the location.  With the numerous special activities going on at either the library, the Swim Center and Central Park, that parking-lot tends to fill up awfully fast and parking soon becomes unavailable (especially when some spaces are blocked-off by Park staff for some bizarre reason.)  There is some underground parking available underneath the library, but it is small & difficult to maneuver in there and also fills up quickly.  What is really needed is a large, multi-level parking-structure for the Library, the Swim Center and Central Park.  I for one would support the construction of such a structure, as I believe it is needed.<//Review>< Pictures>

There are so many varieties of books, and the staff is really nice. The comic con is always fun to attend, and the summer reading results in great books to read. This library is the best organized I have ever seen, as the holds are so nicely put together. The park is right next to it, and the library is near a small expand of grass which in you can lay down and read a book. I've been coming here since I was 5, and I l think this is the best library ever!< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

<Review>Email notification of due date has failed for months. Sent inquiry to library but received no response. They didn't care about fixing the new beta system which stopped sending due date notice by email even if you signed up. Ultimately many users get fined when there is no email of reminder. They did not deliver the service as promised. Disappointing.<//Review>< UserId.>

A literary oasis in an otherwise soulless Silicon Valley. This place and Kepler's Books in Menlo Park have helped me feel less alone here as a reader and a writer. Excellent collections, kind and thoughtful librarians, warm and light-filled reading rooms, perfectly paired with the public park, Central Park Library is an excellent place go come catch up on some reading and writing. Highly recommend their audio book selection!<//text>

It's a very spacious library with high ceilings, there are plenty of desks and chairs for people to sit and read or work.

Parking can be a little bit challenging during weekends.

The park nearby is a great place to relax, have a walk or have a picnic with families and friends.<//Text>

The library is good and has good collection of books. Most of the time I found it full of people. It's not empty at all any time of the day. There are of places to study. The study tables have charging stations. The wifi is also good but if you are connected for long then it may ask for authentication again. The only thing that I think is missing is the group study rooms. They have only 2. There is small cafe inside which is fine.</review>

It is a perfect place, very cozy, very warm environment but there are two problems, first the opening hour which is at 10 is really late. I would love it if it was opening earlier.
Second, It's always great to have library open, more than working days. I really don't like the opening and closing times on weekends! It's too short!< /Text>

A great library in Cupertino. The interior is very nicely decorated. If you are book lover, you can spend a whole day inside the library. The central park is right behind the library. That is also a great place to spend time with kids. We have membership in this library. Only one tiny gripe I have about the online portal of this library is that I cannot transact online (e.g. check my borrowed items extend return dates etc.). However, you can browse the catalog  online.< /review>

Well for starters the people here act like they are so much better then anyone around I mean really the ones at Santana row where nicer than these people and the wifi well I tried playing a game but all I wants to say is sever is not responding that's all I could get out of it and where I had chose to sit which was by the window at a disk that had been used for self check out which isn't that now they try saying I was block the self check out I had told them I was sitting here so that I could see my bike I was tired of people stealing them and that I wasn't blocking any such thing cause the self checkout is about 8 feet away so they walked away just to have the lady cleaning come over and now she needed to clean the area if I could please find another place she didn't say another place to sit just another place I thought this was a public library but its apparent that this is not so here in santa clara the people here are selfish, rude,and uncaring about those who just don't have keeping others down and not caring to help that is the true problem</Text>

Like the library and there are plenty of seats to read and study. Downside is that many homeless people staying in the quiet studying area stinks.  Can’t stand the smell.</Text>

The staff are plentiful and knowledgeable, and the shelves are well stocked. Parking can be a bit scarce at busier times, but you can always find a spot. There are plenty of spaces to study or read before checking out a book or movie.<//review>

Comfortable chairs, nice clean restrooms, snack bar (how many libraries have a snack bar?), great location (best donut shop ever is across that street) and they even have lots and lots of great books.< /text><userid>104609986268358875711</userid><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x808fb57edaed9903:0x881294cf2f99f6fc< /gmapID>< Name>

Quiet, comfortable spaces for doing so much - from work at a computer table facing the big lawn to reading in an arm chair next to the fireplace to listening to the children read in the most charming children's library.</review>

<review>A nice quiet studying place that I go to everyday to do my homework and check my email. I reserved one of the study rooms on the 2nd floor to study in and help my siblings with their homework. The next day I tried to reserve a room again for the same reason but I was denied. I asked why and the lady at the desk said my siblings were too young. But I had no warning of this because apparently only 13 year olds and up are allowed. But there is no sign anywhere saying this. And I have seen toddlers and young children repeatedly in there, and they have not been asked to leave. I told the lady this and she responded with a quite rude comment of saying how they are an exception like I was allowed the privilege of using the room. The library ladies on the second floor believe that they are some sort of law enforcement and are quite boastful and arrogant. I enjoy the library but these few ladies get a bit on my nerves. Sorry had to rant a little.< /review>< pics>

< Review>
I needed a new policy for my vehicles and I called them up for a quote. I got quoted a very good deal for my two cars. The process was very quick and easy, I brought in my paper work and within minutes I got my insurance. My mother in law referred me to this company and I was told she will be getting a credit. I had a wonderful experience thanks to Ines. She was very informative and helpful. The whole process was easy and quick.< /Review>

I called to get insurance on my girlfriends car and Ines was a really big help and very understanding and gave us the best deal with our insurance policy. I highly recommend requesting to speak with Ines if you call for anything regarding your insurance policy :)<//text>

I went in to Hammer insurance today looking for a quote and I was helped right away. Awesome costumer service was provided and they truly help you find the cheapest and most beneficial insurances needed. I would definitely recommend this insurance and location. Ask for Kastley!< /Text>

Stephanie L. Legorreta did a great job at finding the best quotes that fit in with my bad record. She's not only beautiful with a personality to match, she's also very helpful and gives insight on different options available.
Recommendations to all looking for insurance.< /text>

This is the worst place to go get insurance they will tell you one price just for you to get their insurance and then when the bill actually comes it will be a higher price. They are all liar in there don't trust what Javier o Ines says. This is not a business you want to go to . I have had several problems with them and they never  fix anything. Worst customer service! I would never recommend anyone who needs insurance to come to this place all they care about is stealing your money!<//Text>

Love Dr Berry.  I always feel 100% better after Dr Berry adjusts me.  His staff is super nice and everyone is very professional. Very safe office if you are worried about COVID. They take lots of precautions!   I’m so grateful for Dr Berry!  A lifesaver when my back acts up!!!  Highly recommend 😊<//Text>

Our newborn has a sever lip and tongue tie and we had it revised with a local dentist. Dr. Berry was on a list of recommended providers that the dentists provided for bodywork to help with tension due the lip and tongue ties. My baby’s latch has improved and she does seem less tense. More than that his office staff is friendly and efficient at check in. Dr. Berry was very personable and really gets to know you and hold conversation, not to mention how great he is with kids, he was very gentle with my newborn and even demonstrated the pressure he’d use on her as to show me it would not hurt her. He also interacted well with my two year old who wasn’t even getting adjusted. This is a place you can bring the entire family. I would highly recommend!<//text>

<date>1614458184961<//date><Review>The doctors were very attentive to my concerns and focused on providing me with the treatment that I need in an effort to address the actual problems that I’ve been suffering from. They take a wholistic approach to treatment, which I respect and appreciate. I look forward to the continued improvement in my condition and how it will impact all areas of my daily life. Chronic pain can interfere with quality of life and overall health and wellness. For the first time I’m hopeful that I might be able to focus on life, rather than merely looking at what it could be through the fog of constant physical pain.<//Review><username>Nathan Rodriguez</username><Rate>5<//Rate><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

The staff is so friendly & helpful! Dr. Berry takes the time to explain everything and makes you feel very comfortable. It was my first time getting adjusted & I am currently pregnant, was a little nervous but Dr. Berry and the staff ensured a great experience. Will definitely be going here and no other from now on!</Text>

<Text>I love this practice. The staff is extremely friendly and professional, making each visit super efficient and comfortable. Dr. Berry is amazing. Being 6 months pregnant, I was slightly apprehensive about being adjusted (although I’ve been adjusted while not pregnant) but his personality, professionalism, and amazing bedside manner made me really comfortable which makes the adjustments so much better. I am so thankful for this practice as it’s making my pregnancy that much better.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x80ea43cbb890c581:0x8f74749fb5a89114</GmapID></record>

< Review>
Everyone at core chiropractic are wonderful people. From the ladies at the front desk, to the girls that help with my treatments. The chiropractors are amazing and certainly have me leaving feeling my best after a few adjustments. They are always giving me different options to help relive my pain when I’m at home. By far the best chiropractors and team ever.< /Review>

<Review>After 2 months of insurance delays, I was finally able to get back to see Dr. Berry. In the midst of this pandemic, I was truly grateful to have my temperature taken before I walked in the door. Everyone had masks on, and there was hand sanitizer available at the front desk. They are taking all the precautions they can to keep their patients and staff protected. Chiropractic adjustments and massages are definitely essential for me and I am thankful to the wonderful staff for making me feel safe.< /Review>< gmap_id>

Whenever I need a treatment or adjustment I come see Dr Berry. It’s a nice place the staff are very nice and the place is clean. Dr Berry have a different way of treating you, unlike other chiropractor. I really like the scraping along with a great adjustment.
Thank you for always helping me with my pain.<//Text>

I have been seeing Dr. Berry for several years now. I love this office! Everyone is very nice, from the front office staff, to the massage therapists, to Dr. Berry himself. The office is very clean, and in a good location. If you're looking for a new chiropractic office, you should definitely try this office!</review>

<text>Dr. Berry and all of his staff are wonderful! I'm always in and out and treated so well. I started going to Dr. Berry for pre natal chiropractic care which helped so much and now after I had my daughter I go for routine visits. I live an hour away from his office but the drive is so worth it. Thanks Dr. Berry and staff for being Amazing!< /text>< Pictures>

<name>Hazel</name><Time>1551387766666<//Time><rating>5<//rating><Review>I first started seeing Dr. Berry in 2012 after a nasty car accident, and another chiropractic care who only wanted money and never applied the individualized care that I needed to get better. It was refreshing to find a doctor that cared about his patients! Actually, even to the point that, though we hadn't even met yet, I walked out due to the response of one of his front desk gals; and he personally called me and cleared up the matter. A few people posted reviews about her specifically, and truly, to my surprise, she wasn't there anymore. This really shows how much he cares about his patients. I saw him for a few years and then life got busy. I just recently went to the new office after not seeing him in over a year... Wow has his practice grown! And... He still remembers my husband and kids, asked about how things are with them, and STILL works hard at applying individualized care. What a great doc!! I recommend him to family and friends all of the time.<//Review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x80ea43cbb890c581:0x8f74749fb5a89114</gmap_id></record>

<Text>Very caring and attentive. The staff went over and beyond helping my driver by taking his blood pressure. They work with my schedule and health issues. I can't walk well and have back pain. The whole staff is non judgemental and everybody is right there on the front line offering whatever I need. I never waited and I never left thinking about anything but having more faith in recovery. I am assured it will get better and that means a lot.</Text><user>107247965409357681354<//user>< Date>

I love Dr.Berry he's so good at what he does and he makes sure you're okay, I'm not sure if I went in on a bad day but the lady in the front checking me in didn't seem friendly at all, she wasn't rude but she wasn't welcoming either, other than that Dr is great 👌👌<//text>

Office staff said they would call me within 3 days to see if my insurance would cover my visit. 2 week later nothing, no call. I dial them up give them my name and the lady proceeds to ask for my insurance info for a second time. Told her never mind I don’t want to wait for another call I will not receive.</text>

<username>Zeus Luther</username><date>1537198292434<//date><Rating>5<//Rating><Text>Core Chiropractic is a wonderful location, with a friendly staff and nuanced team of physicians. I have been receiving treatment for a while now, and can whole-heartedly say that the staff has an innate ability to aid in the treatment of spinal injury or fatigue, more so than most other locations. Along with quality service, they also cooperate with a variety of other medical institutions and practitioners to refer patients to that require additional or more specialized assistance and treatment. I highly recommend Core Chiropractic for any malady of the neck or back.</Text>< Pictures>

Before coming here I had sciatic pain and lower back pain due to pregnancy but it all went away and I still continue to go and feel amazing.  I also get the prenatal massage right after. My insurance covers 100% of my visits so I go every week ;). My baby was breeched at 33 weeks Dr Berry will to some techniques that will help the baby get in position and she did she is now ready!! I was afraid of a C section and hopefully she stays in place.  He is the best. He takes his time with you and makes you feel comfortable. I will recommend him to anyone whether you are pregnant or not.< /Review>< Pictures>

I had a fantastic experience. Had a wonderful tour by a student who was very insightful and provided the group relevant information and anecdotes. The centre it’s self was informative and the staff very warm and welcoming. Really great stuff<//Review>

Very cool stadium with an amazing view of the sunsets of Berkeley/San Francisco. Giant capacity, jumbotrons and some other cool areas inside. Medical staff available during events. Food and drink extremely expensive.<//Text>

<Review>The staff seems to consist almost entirely of students. They try to be helpful. However, I would have needed more information than the stuff that I had already read online so I felt let down. Don't expect too much and maybe just go directly to the places on the campus that you want to see.</Review><pics>None</pics>< response>

<Review>Access to the center is not easy, that's the only reason for 4 stars. Parking is horrible!

And there is no resource either. It was a total nightmare and worst experience to have at a campus visit. Just go to their website and this will be the only answer they will give you when asked for further resource or info.< /text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Been twice - Not only first class service, but they generally care about your well being, and the follow up calls, and postcards are truly something spectacular - If you need an urgent care or even just a general check up - I can recommend South Bay 100%<//Review>< rating>

This place is amazing for your healthcare needs. All the staff are tremendously nice and friendly; from the receptionists to the Dr. I went in yesterday because I cut my finger with a knife and this urgent care stitched me up in no time. Please come here if you are feeling ill, you won't regret it!

I was so impressed with South Bay Urgent Care. They have set the tone for a positive experience as soon as you open the door. The reception area is clean and welcoming. I was greeted with a smile and welcomed by the staff members. I visited at a pretty low key time, and was seen promptly. The Dr.s were so friendly, professional, and genuinely cared that I left on the mend. Not having insurance, their pricing was very fair and affordable. Thank you South Bay Urgent Care team for taking care!</text>

Worst facility I’ve ever been in.  I called ahead to Matt and explained my symptom.  He said no problem come down.  Upon arrival i was treated with disrespect because I was asking how much the visit and co pay would be.  I received nothing but a stand off attitude from the reception.  5/18/2021.
I highly suggest driving ten minutes up the road to Coronado hospital.  Way cleaner and way more accommodating to someone who’s not feeling good.
Do not use this service.</review>

This urgent care was awesome.  They took great care of my elderly grandfather.  He cut his hand and the Dr quickly stitched it up. He went back and got the stitches out a few days ago and tgis morning they called to see how he was doing.  Everyone was super friendly and helpful.<//Review>

The ladies in the front are so friendly and welcoming. I am always greeted with a smile. The clinicians are amazing. Issac helped me last time I was there and he made me so happy with his willingness to help. I appreciate him trying to help me with my concerns to the best of his ability. I recommend South Bay Urgent care!</review>

<Text>Absolutely incredible experience!  We showed up 3 minutes to close and were worried my wife wouldn't get seen.  The staff was super friendly, knowledgeable, personable and happy to have us!  We were checked in, had x-rays done and a splint put on in less than 30 minutes.  Absolutely the best medical experience we've ever had!  Highly recommended!<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

< Review>
I stopped by this place on the way home from work a few days ago because I had a lot of respiratory congestion and I thought I might have Covid. This was such a nice urgent care! There were only two people in front of me so I didn’t wait long at all. All of the staff from the front desk people, to the nurse and the doctor were great!  They didn’t treat me any differently even though I couldn’t stop coughing and I sounded very congested. The cost when I went was only $90 and they accepted my insurance so I paid only a portion of that. The bummer was their Covid tests were $150 so I didn’t get one then and I had to take a day off work to go get a free one someplace else.  But that’s alright.  They were still awesome and I’ll go back here next time I need something.</Review>

<Text>Courteous staff and I was seen quickly by the PA. Extra precautions were taken because of COVD19, but I appreciated that.  The nurse who took my blood was the best I ever had.  She got the vein the first time without any pain.  I would highly recommend this place.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Can not begin to tell you how amazing the folks at SBUC are!!!  Where is the 6 stars rating?!?

I had to make a quick trip there when my son was stung by a Sting Ray at Silver Strand State Beach.  Normally stings you soak it in hot water to get by, but this guy decided to break the barb off in my son's foot.  At the advice of the lifeguard we took him to a Urgent Care.  This was the closest we found (closest was actually out of business, luckly for us).

From the very first interaction everyone was extremely friendly, even coming out with a wheelchair to bring him in.  Luckily we went at a down time so we were seen right away, and they soaked his foot in hot water to ease the pain.  Again, everyone who helped from the assistant to the nurse we saw was very nice, and helped my son with his pain.  They were very thorough, and did a quick X-ray to make sure the entire barb was out.  I've never been in and out of a Urgent Care so quick.

Again, can't even begin to thank all the folks at SBUC enough for making our experience so pleasant.  That is how you run a busy.<//review>

I was on vacation and I couldn’t handle my pain I was experiencing and so I did a little research and saw these guys were good. And they really were the best! Super nice receptionists! They were quick to get me to see a doctor! The doctor was very considerate about my situation and wanted the best help I could get with my situation! And for not being a local I felt like I was with my home doctors getting taken care of! I would definitely recommend going to them for anything! If I ever go back to San Diego and have an medical issue I would go back. Thanks for a great service and following up with a thank you card!<//Review>

<review>A very professional and caring place. My wife suffers with COPD and exhibited what seemed to be a cold. SBUC got her in quickly, ran some tests, the PA talked with her, and it was recommended that we go to the ER - good advise! I was very impressed with their pleasant treatment. I highly recommend South Bay Urgent Care if you need immediate care.< /review><Date>1578789467843<//Date><Rating>5</Rating>< user_id>

<text>So I have not been to south bay in awhile due to moving to murrieta. But when I lived 5 minutes away this is where I'd go. I loved this place especially when my kids got sick and couldn't get in to see their primary doc. They were always very nice, the staff and the doctors. The place was clean and we were in and out within the hour. Now that I live in murrieta I cant find an urgent care as good as them nor one that accepts medi-cal. Think ill drive the hr just to see them.< /text>< user_id>

After getting turned away from Concentra off boardway in Chula vista.

I headed here!
I had some really bad back pain that was causing a stiff neck and making it hard to breath at times. Even though i was in a bad mood, the front desk girls were amazing.

Caring, respectful and helpful.

The office gives you the small family feel which is very nice!
If i ever had to go ago this will be my first stop.

Thank you so much for the letter and great customer service!!</Text>

Went in for a flu shot didn’t have to wait long. Staff was very professional and friendly.  Facility is very clean and looks like it was recently remodeled.  Tony gave me my shot and I did not feel the needle but the liquid always stings a little.  You can tell the staff is very knowledgeable! I was surprised to know they do x-rays, and b-12 shots. I would definitely recommend them to a friend best part is their also open on weekends. Shout out to karina and nikki for being so nice! 😉< /text>

<Review>For what it's worth, I have been a Registered Nurse for 21 years. I normally  go to my primary care MD, but I wasn't feeling well and I didn't want to wait for an appointment so I tried South Bay Urgent Care. I'm glad that I did. It's a nice and very clean facility. The front staff was friendly, & efficient. I was seen in a very timely manner by a very nice & knowledgeable physician. She was more helpful than she needed to be, & I really appreciated that extra assistance. I definitely recommend this place, and it's obvious why they have so many five star reviews.<//Review></record>

Came here after waiting for 3 hours at Sharp Chula Vista, and didn't even get my vitals taken so we left as my fever got worse.

South Bay Urgent Care was clean, friendly and super quick to get paperwork out of the way so that I could be seen. Also they take Tricare which we have as my Husband is in the Navy.

Dr. Colton diagnosed me with influenza. I am 12 weeks pregnant so my baby's well being was a concern as my fevers were around 103. I was given Tamiflu, some stuff for nausea and was able to get to the pharmacy before it closed due to the quick service by the staff at South Bay.

My husband, and I thank you so much for you help and for addressing our concerns of how our baby was doing. ❤️❤️❤️❤️</Text>

I don't normally leave reviews, but this place is impressive! I was on vacation in Coronado when a nasty headcold came on, so I knew I needed to get checked out. I frantically started searching for an urgent care spot and thanks to these reviews I chose to go here. I was impressed with how clean and spacious this place was and the wait time was only 10 min on a Friday afternoon. The staff was very kind and helpful. When the doctor came into the room he was friendly and immediately greeted me and shook my hand to introduce himself. He listened to my concerns and answered my questions and prescribed treatment. Definitely the nicest and most approachable doctor I've met in a long time. I was relieved to have such a positive experience on vacation! Great practice!

Update- They even called me a week later to see how I was doing. Now that's service!</Text>

This place was amazing from the moment I walked through the door. I am typically on guard when I visit new facilities for you never know which direction it will go. The name is South Bay but it definitely did not go south.  The staff was welcoming, kind, and knowledgeable about the process. They were very patient with me as I had to take a call during the brief registration process. They were all great with my three year old son who enjoyed screaming with joy for some reason when we got in there. I suppose it was the positive energy.
I could go on and on as I am a huge critic. I only wish they were Primary Care so I could put my healthcare in the hands of Dr. Dickson and his wonderful staff. Thank you South Bay Urgent Care for a great patient care experience. Gold star.</review>

Completely impressed!!! The staff and doctor exceeded my expectations. We walked in about 15 minutes before they closed. I was scared we'd be turned away and asked to return. On the contrary, the office staff were very welcoming and made us feel special. The doctor was simply amazing. She was caring and sympathetic to my daughter's needs. Did I mention there was no wait and the check in forms were so easy to complete. None of this having to provide everything under the sun information.  THANK YOU SOUTH BAY URGENT CARE FOR NOT TREATING US LIKE A NUMBER.</Text>

<Review>My one year old had been acting strange after experiencing a mild cold, so I opted to take her in on a Sunday morning to make sure everything was ok. The facility was very clean, staff was upbeat and friendly. We were seen quickly and painlessly. The doctor was very sweet and thorough, and even called a few days later to follow-up. My doctor's office isn't even that attentive. I would not hesitate to send others here. Thank you!< /Review>< GmapID>

<text>Love the fast and efficient care.
Thanks South Bay Urgent Care!

Would have given 4 star but recently rcvd letters from SBUC stating we owe them money for our visits that our insurance didn't cover,  they NEVER mentioned anything and I asked the time of visit and they didn't say anything. I'm kinda disappointed because of that. But everything else it's fine.

****Update: Received a call from Dr.Dickson, Matthew ONE day after my review (AMAZING), he mentioned the issue was resolved. Thank you so much Doctor!! You guys are the BEST urgent care in San Diego.*****<//text>< response>

I walked in to a very friendly, professional and very clean facility. I was seen by a doctor within 20 minutes of filling out very little paperwork. My doctor was Isiac.  He was friendly and was very professional as well.  It has been along time that I walked into an Urgent Care and left within an hour pleased with the service that I received!👍😊</Review>

<review>We were on vacation in Imperial Beach when my wife developed urinary tract infection... We first Stopped by a different urgent care center in the area and it was filthy and extremely slow. So we left after an hour wait and made it to SouthBay Urgent care....WOW!  What a difference a 5 minute drive made.
Probably the friendliest staff I have ever encountered at an Urgent Care!
It is owned by a Husband and wife Doctor team.  My wife was seen by Dr. Matthew Dickson, and he was very thoughtful, friendly and Fast... We were in and out in about 30 minutes!  They even called us the next day to check if my wife was doing okay!
The office is extremely clean and very nice!
Thank You SouthBay Urgent Care!<//review>< pics>

Dropped in this morning to have a stitch removed from my foot. The staff was so friendly and professional. The Doctor was the same. I only waited 5 mins and was out three mins later. I was well cared for and provided after care instructions. This will be my go to place for any other medical needs. Thank you Southbay Urgeny Care.<//Text>

Junk King were so fast and easy to use. I expected to get voicemail and have to get a callback, but someone answered right away and got me to the right person for a quote. I was able to schedule a delivery for the very same day. They called to let me know when they were 20 minutes out, and were right on time. I am very impressed and happy with their service. 10/10 would highly recommend.</Text>

Called and got an appt the next day.  Very prompt.  Came during time I was given.  In and out for an extremely heavy old desk in 15 minutes.  Professional, friendly.  Service from scheduling appt to job completed was beyond my expectations.  Communication with main office was great!  Kept me up to date on everything.<//Review>

< Review>
This was the best decision we have ever made to call Junk-King!! We had some spring cleaning and got rid of a bunch of stuff just accumulating. They came the next day on time, removed everything for us. Well worth the price we paid! The guys were awesome!! I would recommend this business to anyone.<//Review>

Needed to get rid of my mattress. I hate lugging it anywhere- so I didn’t want to drag it down my stairs and into a car to make the trip somewhere. I found Junk King online. Every person I spoke with through call, text, and in person was polite, helpful, and communicative. Junk King employee arrived within the time frame I booked, grabbed my mattress, and left! Payment was easy too. It was hassle free and well worth my money. Thanks Junk King!<//review>

I called on a Monday and was able to have someone come out on a Tuesday during a time that  accommodated my work schedule. The movers were courteous, polite, efficient, and professional. The cost was reasonable with several options for payment method.
I highly recommend Junk King-Fresno!< /Review>

<text>I ordered a new bed frame not thinking what I would do with my old box spring and metal frame. I looked at different options, but found Junk King had best prices and reviews.  When I called them a very nice lady named Christina answer the phone, walk me through the process, I chose a no-contact service. The two gentlemen that picked up the merchandise were quick  also very
professional. They called me before arriving, just like they said they would and after leaving.  Shortly after I got a call from Megan to receive payment via phone. Overall, very convenient, very pleasant experience, would 100% recommend them to anyone. My service was $75, and I booked them the day before at 4pm. They were here at 8:30am.  Combined  process time 30 minutes.< /text><Name>Fabi Cardenas< /Name><gmapID>0x80945eaca3d25b47:0x48a4a48f26cbffd1<//gmapID></record>

All the employees I spoke to on the phone were polite and helpful, and the gentlemen who came to our home to pick up the furniture items were fast  in getting the job done, and were friendly. The whole experience with customer service performed by this company was refreshing - they do what they say they will do!<//Text>

<text>I just called the day before, and they were able to come out the next day at my convenience. They can fit a lot of stuff in their truck, so you know that everything you need hauled it’s going to get hauled that day. They were very nice, and fair. They really work hard.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

I had just the bare minimum but was unable to personally get rid of the materials. I was happy to hear that they also had a reasonable minimum price for hauling away what I could not. They guys were quick and neat!</Text>

<Text>My entire experience with Junk King was very pleasant, thorough and professional from start to finish!
I was calling for estimates for an appliance removal.  My first call to another company was answered by a grumpy voice. My second call was to Junk King, and I was kindly greeted by Meghan.  The estimate was reasonable, but it was Meghan that sealed the deal.
This company is highly recommended.< /Text><Name>K T<//Name>< rate>

They arrived around 11:15am when the schedule time was from 1pm - 3pm.  I called multiple times to ask the crew to return but did not receive status until my 3rd call to the central number.  The rep (Alicia?) was able to secure time the following day.  The crew called and showed up around 10am vs. the 1pm - 3pm scheduled time.  The crew said that sometimes their schedule changes.  If a crew would be arriving earlier than the scheduled time, it would be good to advise customers that this could happen either on the website or when I scheduled the pick-up.<//Text><pics>None</pics><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

<Review>2 men came on time, were very polite and courteous. They gave me my quote which was very reasonable, gave me a $20 discount for booking online and then were  just awesome and knocked the price down by another $30. They removed everything in about 10 minutes and I was able to pay with a debit card. I would definitely use them again.< /Review>< rating>

< Review>
We’ve been collecting things that needed to go to the dump for too long and with three little kids at home and no truck, we finally realized that hiring someone to do the job was completely worth it— and it is! This is not the cheapest way to get rid of your junk, but money well spent. We should’ve done it sooner! Booking was so simple and the guys came right when we needed them. They were quick and courteous.< /Review>

My daughters cleaned out my garage & set up appointment with Junk King. Initial contact was very professional, pleasant, & reassuring for me. The men who cleaned up were great: courteous & pleasant. I can’t express how quick & efficient this service was. I will most definitely return to them when needed. Reasonably priced, too.</review>

The price was good, $98 for removal of queen mattress and queen bed box spring frame. Additional $20 off for booking online. A star taken off for removal. Although the removers were in and out quickly, I did not receive a phone call letting me know they were 15 minutes away. Instead the call was to let me know they were here at the gate. Good service overall, will use again.<//Text>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>I couldn't be happier with Junk King. Wes and crew resolved a problem that I'd been avoiding for 15 years. They removed an ancient swimming pool filter--a large steel tank filled with sand and gravel--that was in a position that couldn't be reached by a crane and was surrounded by newer pool equipment. Wes took on the challenge and resolved the issue to my total satisfaction!  And at a very reasonable price. I highly recommend Junk King and would definitely use them again.</text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

<text>We had a ton of branches and foliage needing picked up around our yard; after trimming several trees. Junk King’s came and removed all of it in one load! (we thought it may take more than one) The two gentlemen who came to our home worked quickly, efficiently, and excellently. Both were kind and did their best to fit all of our “junk”  in one load, keeping our cost down. I was truly grateful for their service, and highly recommend this company!</text><name>Arthur Garland</name></record>

The team at Junk King was great to work with. Made our appointment quickly and was well within the timeframe provided. The team that arrived at our home to help dispose of waste was on point, friendly and very professional. I believe their names were Brian and Mitchell (sorry if I got this wrong). I would highly recommend their service.</text>

JUNG KING WAS AWESOME! I set up an appointment time online which was a two hour window and said they’d call me on the day of my appointment, 20 mins before arriving to my house to let me know they’re coming. They came and took my two large couches within 5 minutes. So fast, efficient, and friendly. Will definitely them again for furniture/ junk removal.  Thanks again guys, it was a pleasure!

P.S. It was $50 cheaper than what I expected to pay.</Review>

I contacted JunkKings via their website the night before in order to have a cal king mattress and some box springs removed from my home. Not only did these guys show up, professionally remove my furniture (while following COVID guidelines), they chose to give me a courtesy call 4 hours prior to our scheduled time to inform me that they could come by earlier if it was okay with me. By far exceeded my expectations, thank you Junk Kings. I highly recommend this business for the removal of your junk.</text>

Junk King was on time, efficient, professional and their prices were great. If you're wondering if they take tires, yes they do, and they only charge $5-10 per tire depending on size. Def recommend.</text>

<Review>The people answering the phones were especially nice and very helpful. There were some challenges for the drivers so the time window was not kept, but the rescheduled drivers the next day called to keep me informed of their estimated arrival. They were very courteous and respectful of my property while achieving the task at hand. Even with the one unfortunate circumstance, overall they made it right and provided quality service and a reasonable price.< /Review><gmapID>0x80945eaca3d25b47:0x48a4a48f26cbffd1</gmapID>< UserId.>

We've used Junk King in Fresno twice this year. Both times they were very professional. The online estimator and scheduler is a plus, and the employees are courteous and do a good job. Highly recommended.<//Review>

We had the best experience with Junk King today. They hauled our hot tub out for us on short notice. I really wish I got their names, but the two gentlemen who did the job were very kind and professional with great customer service. I really appreciated them offering to take more of our junk that was lying around. I would definitely recommend this business!</review>

The men were serious about their job , didn’t waste any time. Each one had a task and was efficient. They analyzed, and applied the appropriate action to take the hot tub. They were respectful and good human beings. Thank you very much ! Because of them I’ll call on you again.</Review>

The appointment process was quick and easy. The guys came right in time, and called 20 minutes before they arrived.
They were professional and very kind.  They gave us a quote, and loaded things up quickly.
I would say that the end price was quite a bit more than I wanted to spend, but the fact that they came out for the free estimate with not obligation made me WANT to use their service. I probably paid $50 more than I wanted to, buy oh well. They were very nice guys. I would use them again, despite the price.< /review>

Call ahead and we’re very helpful. I had a twin box spring, a twin mattress and a full sized mattress. And they took them all and without any hassle on my part.
Highly recommend.< /Text>

Hard working guys! I hired them for a hot tub removal, which was more labor intensive than I imagined. They all worked together and got the job done. Super friendly and professional would definitely recommend! Thank you!</review>

The guys were early, which was fine.  It gave me the rest of the day to do my errands.  I will highly recommend this company. Although I only had two items, an old computer monitor and an old television. Thank guys.< /Text>

<Review>I called on a Saturday afternoon and a real person answered the phone. A team of two guys came by midday Monday to pick up my worn out recliner. They called me about a half hour before they arrived to give me a heads-up.

Fast, efficient and great service. It was a painless, worry-free process.<//Review><pics>None< /pics><Name>Rob Palmer<//Name>< Date>

<Review>I set up my pick up on their website the night before, love how easy that was. I set a time window of 10-12.

They called and gave me a time estimate from their GPS when they were on their way, and they were here and done before 12.

They found my place easily, three men came up, got my mattress and box spring out the door super fast. All friendly, and the one who seemed to be the lead of the group shook my hand after I handed him the check. (I’m a woman and I notice when men treat me with business respect). They take cash, check, and credit.

It was $98 for removal of a queen mattress and box spring. Was I supposed to tip? I didn’t, and now I’m not sure. Gah! Someone let me know what’s the standard for next time please?

Definitely recommend.<//Review>< Response>

<review>I requested a quote through the Yelp messages feature on the Junk King Fresno page and they replied within minutes. After a few messages about details of the what I needed removed they gave me a quote. Two days later, two gentlemen showed up within the quoted timeframe and removed our items. They were quick and professional. I would recommend them to family and friends.< /review><Name>Juan Gomez</Name><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

From start to finish I highly recommend this company! From the beginning on figuring out price, which Manny was great to talk to. The drivers that came were very nice and respectful. And then paying by card was easy. Again I highly recommend this company. I called 2 others before Junk King and Junk King stood out the most to me.<//Text>

The guys worked extra hard getting the junk removed. My only issue was the price we were quoted was $200 less than what we ended up paying. We added some stuff but even so, Thats a big difference. Other than that they were awesome!< /Review>

Had lots of fence wood & they got it cleaned it up as fast as they could. The nice gentlemen cleared all of my items and did a good job. I’d recommend Junk King to anyone who needs a good trash hauler. I plan having them back when the house is up for sale to clean it up.< /text>

They are fast, efficient, and kind! You can set a pick up online and call or email if anything changes. I would say their prices are pretty fair as well. Thanks for hauling my junk away Junk King!< /Review>

Moving my mother out of her apartment in with me was already and emotional and exhausting time . Having them come in and remove the things during COVID 19 that I did not know what to do with, was an awesome feeling. I am forever grateful for them coming in and literally taking this load off my hands.< /Text>

The company was quick to respond and pick up the items.  I could not get a quote on the phone.  It was far more expensive than I would have expected, but great service.< /Text>

Scheduled the appointment online and they called me 30 minutes before my service window opened which was great! They even let me add 1 item to my pick up order. Everything was done and taken care in less than 15 minutes. Junk companies can be expensive because they have a lot of bills to pay themselves so if you complain about $238 being high to dispose of a couch, old 16-17yr old 1080i tube TV and a power recliner with a lift then good luck finding an easier way to dispose of your stuff. I will do business with this company again.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>There was a lot of things to be moved, some extremely heavy. The crew had it all done so quickly. They were very professional and their customer service is excellent. The only thing I would have liked to change is the price, but overall I don't feel like it was money wasted. I will use them again.<//Review><pics>None<//pics></record></dataset><record>

This is a great company. The were
more than prompt. The price was a bargain. My usual trash pickup was cancelled and my curb was full. The city wanted me to take the trash and put it back in the yard. I was very happy with the professional way my request was handeled. I will definitly call them again.< /Review>

They picked up 2 queen size mattresses which I paid 158 dollars for pick up and then the next day I saw one of my mattresses on the side of the freeway. It must of blown out of their truck. They should of secured it in their truck. I let them know but I haven’t received a response.<//Review>

Would recommend Junk King. The workers were efficient, polite, and fast in loading all my junk into the truck. They called and gave me a heads up 10 minutes before they arrived. In less than an hour they had removed all I needed to have done. 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼For Junk King!<//Review>

The team from Junk King cleaned up and hauled off a pile of debris that filled up there truck to the max for a very reasonable price which was cheaper than me renting a roll off container and having to load it myself.
Would highly recommend Junk King for your next clean up project.
Thanks again Junk King ,

Christopher and Isaiah were such a pleasure.  They were fast, efficient and did an amazing job in moving everything out.  I would recommend Junk King to anyone and look forward to using them again very soon.</Review>

I recently bought a fixer upper property that was literally waist deep in junk. I called Junk King and they came the same day and removed 9000 pounds of garbage/furniture/appliances/etc. The staff was professional and friendly and the price was very fair. I highly recommend Junk King! 5 STARS!!!</text>

Really close to on time - delayed by long line at the dump.  Took 2 hours to accomplish what it would have taken me 3 days+.  Highly recommend especially if you get Michael as one of the drivers.  Michael and his sidekick worked their rears off.  Made me tired just watching them.  Once again HIGHLY RECOMMEND - would give them 10 stars if that were an option.< /review>

<UserId.>114222860779631306953< /UserId.><Text>I had Junk King remove an old refrigerator. I set up the appointment online and was able to text then a picture of the refrigerator. They arrived on time and were extremely polite. The only little hiccup was the price. I sent a picture of the refrigerator to be removed and received a price of $98 to remove. When they arrived, I was told it would be $108.  It wasn’t a difficult item to move so I was a bit surprised by the extra cost.< /Text>< Gmap_id>

Isaiah showed up three minutes early. He was patient and so careful with my things as he helped me sort junk from important pieces. He made it easy to plow through two intimidating storage units in a short time and with no stress. I have a lot more to get rid of and there is no doubt that I will call Junk King. I’ll also recommend their services to anyone who asks. Five stars AND thumbs up!</Text>

Polite, professional, patient and lightening fast at completing our clear-out. The pricing structure is very easy to understand and extremely reasonable. I’ve used Junk King in two different cities now (San Mateo & Fresno), and I’ve been extremely pleased! You’re doing it right!</review>

While they made the 10 AM to Noon window by about 30 seconds, the first call I got was at 9:30 AM saying they’d be there in 25 minutes. From there it was a string of calls saying just 20 more minutes.

Once they got there though, they were professional, respectful, and fast.<//Review>

Really enjoyed the guys picking up (Mike and crew).  They were friendly, efficient, clean, and kept professional demeanor. They even cleaned up after it was all done. In addition, they were quite fair with the add-ons I had after the initial bid. I would definitely use they again if needed.< /review>

I’m very satisfied with the service. We had about 1.5 truck loads worth of trash that needed to be taken away after a four day party at home. Two guys showed up after giving us a 20 minutes warning through call. They got all the trash out in about 10 minutes. They were very professional.< /Review>

They even dealt with some pretty nasty lawn sludge, and didn’t even hesitate to get it moved, “this is what we do ma’am”, is what one man said.

Company is great! We had to empty a house that was a total disaster. Pricing was very competitive. The guys that came out were on time, honest, friendly, and fast! They even questioned some items they thought could be of importance before just tossing them. I would recommend them for any size job. We are remodeling our house and I will be calling them again.< /Review>

These guys that came today did a great job!  I was happy finally after 3 appts that it could be completed! The first appt I was told that the estimate and haul away would happen. Only the estimate happened so another appt was made but no one said it had to be disconnected so the third appt it was finally done after I had someone out to disconnect! I was very disappointed! Today these guys were great!! I feel I should have had a discount for all the times I waited and the inconvenience!<//review>

I found your website on a Sunday evening and booked an appointment for the next day, between 8:00 and 10:00 am.  You called about 8:00 am Monday morning and said you were fifteen minutes away.  Upon arrival, I was given what I thought was a fair price and within a half hour a big pile of a broken up backyard deck and maybe 500 pounds of concrete pieces were gone.  I would definitely use you guys again.<//Review>

The whole crew was very friendly and respectful.  They kept me updated about their arrival time, they loaded up a full truck & cleaned up the area in half the time I thought it would take them.  The time and cost savings were awesome for the price.  I would have spend many hours and truck load trips to do it on my own.  Give these guys a call, I wish they'd been around years ago.</review></record>

<Text>Awesome service, quote was reasonable and easy (just text a pic of items needing pickup!) and service men were on time  for pickup appointment - what more could you ask for?
Recommend you combine pickup w a neighbor if you don't have much to pick up, since there is a minimum pickup fee. Very pleased!<//Text>< Name>

<Review>DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY. Their high reviews must have been bought. Companies do that. This is a horribly run company. They do not have the equipment needed to do the job properly. If you hire them, the first thing you'll discover is that they over book all their jobs. So they will be several hours late getting to your job and will not take the time needed to do your job because they need to go to the next one. The guys that come to do the job are great. I had Mike and Zaite. Great guys but they have to do everything by hand which puts them at great risk and takes a long time. Since they have to do it all by hand and are constantly running behind, they can't/don't/won't load the truck in an efficient manner. You will pay for a full load when the truck could have easily held twice as much. So that is a little scam they run. Since they won't get your whole load in, they sell you another work day. So you end up paying twice as much as you should have if loaded properly. If they quote you $500, be fully prepared to pay $1000 to actually get it  done.They wanted to take 3 days to do what a proper hauling company did in one day for me. (See pictures in my review for Kevin Moya Junk Hauling in Visalia). This clown Isaiah that runs that Fresno location of Junk King is the one that double books these boys. I had furniture as well as yard waste. These guys have to try to bust up stuff by hand. It's rediculous. If you like to waste a lot of money and spend several days to get your stuff hauled, this is the company for you. Katie Smith in Lemon Cove< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< user>

<response>{'time': 1533679377151, 'text': 'Hello Katie,\nI’m sorry to read about your experience in Back in early June. We always strive to take care of each and every one of our customers and leave them smiling when our job is completed. To clarify, 0 of the reviews have been paid for. They are all genuine and from customers that have used Junk-King’s service. We filled each Junk-King truck to full capacity and showed you it was full before leaving the job site. We attempted to accommodate you and your husband’s requests as much as possible. By your review, it’s apparent you feel we came up short and I apologize for that. If there is anything I can do to assist you please let me know. You can reach me through our company phone number at 559-205-7118.\n\nThank you,\nWes Burgess\nOwner\nJunk-King'}<//response>< Rate>

I contacted Junk King on a Sunday, got an answer right away and on Monday three friendly people came to my house gave me the estimate and I agreed and my junk is gone.
Would use Junk King again and will refer them to my friends too
Thank you<//review>

<Review>I had an estimate of $800 to remove to gardening trailers with some green waste and to golf carts when your guys showed up they said they would be back in a few days to remove the two trailers they took some green waste and some boards out of each one of the gardening trailers they left in the meantime I found someone to haul those trailers off there was still green waste and
boards in  left on them I called someone at your office told her I didn't need them to come back and take the two two trailers  that person told me I had to pay $400 just for the little green waste and boards that they removed I'm very unhappy I don't think I should be charged $400 since your estimate was $800 for the two trailers what was inside them and the two golf carts the two golf carts are still here so plz I don't mind paying I feel that that $400 is way too much thank you for your time<//Review>< pictures>
