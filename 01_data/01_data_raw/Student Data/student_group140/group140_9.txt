Hello Everyone Reading This, I would like to first just start off by saying I moved into this neighborhood about 5 years ago and shortly after moving here I really ran into hard times and needed money really quick. I didn`t know anyone around me and other family members were just to far to really help so I just started looking for the closest Pawn Shop near me and found Community which was only around the corner from my house. I looked for stuff I might have that I could pawn to help get the money I so desperately needed and grabbed what few things I had that was worth anything and took them over to Community Pawn and I just can`t express or say just how nice they were to me then and even up until this day almost 5 years latter are the most nicest people I have ever met, especially being in they`re field of business. they`re just really not the kind of people you would think being a pawn shop and of course if you don`t come get you stuff or pay your interest in time they just keep your items to resale for a profit your, well not Community Pawn Shop. They are nothing like that and on the contrary of what most people think about pawn shops all the employees at Community Pawn really have a kind and decent heart and over the past 5 years I have actually went back to them time and time again when times were tuff and just needed a little help to get me by and they have always helped me get through with whatever I needed the best they could with ever I had to pawn, even times when I was late on paying my interest they worked with me so I wouldn`t lose it. I I`m just writing this because I just want everyone taking the time to read this to know that if you are in need of help and really need money for whatever the reason and maybe just a little nervous or scared to pawn your treasured or hard earned items in fear of possibly losing them or anything like that, I can personally tell you there is nothing to worry about when it comes to Community Pawn because as long as you communicate with them and let them know what ever you may be going through in your life, or you`re just short on your payment or just whatever it may be, Community Pawn will never turn there backs or give you the cold shoulder on your pawned items. I can personally promise you they will always do everything in there power to make sure your items are safe and that you will get them back when the time is right for you if you just communicate with them. I can honestly make you this promise because they have personally did it for me a few times over the past 5 years and since that first day I went to them nearly 5 years ago they have now become like very good close friends of mine and we laugh and smile at each other every time I walk through their front door now.
Before ending this review and with hopes by writing it, it help anyone out there that`s thinking if they want to take a chance on pawning any of you personal items or if they are going to be safe or just in fear of possibly losing them or anything like that, please know that Community Pawn is very respectful, trustworthy and honest. They have some of the most awesomest employees I have ever had the pleasure of meeting and doing business with in a time of need. I would like to end this with naming just a few of the awesome people that I have come to know at Community Pawn and that look at and consider like friends,  I say this because a true friend will always be there for you and will always have your back in a time of need and Jaun, Chris and Elmar are just a few of the best people and human beings that I could have ever met when needing help and a little fast cash to get me by. I`ve trusted them with some of my most treasurable, personal and sentimental valuables without fear of losing them. So I`m ending with this, it`s been 5 years and after many many pawns I have not once lost any of my stuff, and there`s actually been a couple times when I surely could have if it were not for Community Pawns understanding and I can promise they will treat you and any one else the same exact way. Thanks Community Pawn.< /review>

Greatest pawn shop I have ever walked in! They gave me a great deal on my 14k rope chain unlike any other pawn shops who give me low deals. The staff is very respectful and worked around the price I was looking for. They are very organized and have a wider selection of jewelry. They have parking too. Recommend to anyone who's either selling their items or buying.<//Review>

<Review>Great pawn shop I've ever been to.  Employees are very kind and helpful.  I went their to sale some of my gold and they gave me great money, as well as I wanted to buy a professional camera I saw they had.  The employee was very nice and very friendly and this is why I would definitely come back and I would definitely recommend my friends and family to this place.  They have almost everything you might be looking for.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x80c2c8137723161f:0x9b8fc27a9f71dc56< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

< review>
This place is a front for stolen property , scumbag criminals, who support crime by selling stolen goods. -- They posted a photo add of my stolen leaf blower, I found add on Craigslist, and when I called to confirm serial number, the "maneger" said it was sold a month ago and add was immediately removed . Den of thieves,scumbag liers.Police are useless because its misdemeanor crime and won't investigate. Please don't support criminals by patronizing  this business of ill repute.</review>

Carl, like we told you over the phone, every item taking in by our pawnshop by law we report it to law enforcement agencies to make sure these items are not lost or stolen. We asked you to come in to help you out, we don’t provide information over the phone because we don’t know who you are. Secondly, this blower has been in pawn for over a year, and just recently came out for sale because owner did not claim it back. Impossible this blower was yours and you could come in to compare serial numbers for your peace of mind. But telling lies about our store is not good.'}</Response><gmapID>0x80c2c8137723161f:0x9b8fc27a9f71dc56<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>The people are nice but they just have a horrible business. Every time I go their they offer me some dirt cheap prices. For example, $25 for a computer that I paid $250 for. Another example, $25 for a TV that I paid $150 for. I waste my time every single time.</review>< Pics>

<Text>They are unprofessional, inadequate scammers. But I don't blame them. I blame everyone else for dealing with their nonsense. I brought my camera in and wanted to sell it, being that I bought a new camera and had no use for it. The guy says how much do you want for it? And i aaked, How much do you want to offer? he says I don't to offend you ..20 bucks. Mind you this camera is a point and shoot. He showed me the value of the camera with all the pieces used for 89.99 plus tax it would be about 97 bucks. Without pieces reasonably it should cost no less than 70. (Pieces as in usb, aux, etc, you know you can buy all of that at the 99 cents store). Scammers I tell you.<//Text>< pics>

<text>(Translated by Google) I have visited this place several times and the process to buy and to pawn has been easy and fast, what I liked most about this place and what I would highlight is the attention and customer service especially of the employee named Juan I think that Llama easily memorizes what one has looked for before and when they return if they have it they show it even if one does not even remember me surprised taking into account that they have daily diversity of clients, clean place, parking, speed everything well in general.

It always helps out to write your experience so that we know what we need to improve on. If it was related to an item you were quoted on, please note we base our prices on today's market resale value, not on what you actually paid. Most people get upset because their items are not worth what they paid, not knowing that things depreciate (go down in price) over time. Thank you"}<//response>< Rating>

Outstanding park. If you are someone who loves parks, swing on over to Gentrytown's neighborhood park. It's a bit of a maze getting to it but interesting also.<//review>

Like the rest of Antioch this place is full of garbage and is treated really poorly. It makes me sad because this is a great place for a community to gather and spend time together but it's just so full of trash it makes it hard to enjoy. It is quite spacious and features several amenities such as a playground, large fields, bathrooms and a baseball field. It's a shame that it isn't valued more highly and treated like it should be.</text>< pics>

<Rate>4< /Rate><Review>Bathrooms need a little attention but this is a great park to bring your family to. Don't be surprised if you see parked cars with smoke coming out the windows. That parking lot is far from the playground though so I don't think kids really notice. Great place for well behaved dogs, just be mindful of your surroundings. We like bringing frisbees and kites depending on the weather. The park seems to be connected/adjacent to an elementary school, so if the baseball diamond is occupied you can probably use theirs if it's the weekend.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<review>This park is sad and forgotten.

The entire grass area is so riddled with dog turds that you cannot take a single step and not step in some. This is not an exaggeration in any way.

The park play structure is in coarse sand with garbage throughout.

The play structure is missing parts and rusty in every spot the paint has worn away.

Layers of grafitti and carvings of mexican gang symbols.

A unleashed dog ran at my son and showed signs of aggression.

There are better parks.</review><date>1508555678550<//date>< rating>

Wonderful service from Jimmy and Navin today! Jimmy provided the most comprehensive customer service I’ve had in a long time. He helped us with every step of the way with purchasing several things for a home office for two professionals. Jimmy was friendly and warm, and his very demeanor made the process easier. Navin helped check out our large order efficiently. A great experience overall. A+ service.< /text>

The staff here has been nicer and more accommodating of my random office supply needs than any other office depot or staples or other spot in legit the entire East Bay. From the folks who pick up the phone  to the people running the register, to shift managers, I have consistently been impressed and pleasantly surprised.  Credit where credit is due. When I need to buy multiple white boards, oversize printer paper, or whatever else my esoteric office or artistic needs are that pop up, I always look forward to my trips here.</review>

< Review>
All we wanted was a decent office chair to replace the defective chair we purchased here a month ago.  They would not attempt to fix it, as over 30 days had passed, so we decided to simply purchase a new one.

We were repeatedly pointed to a selection of chairs that we were informed we could take home as-is.  However, each time we chose one of the items in question, we were informed (after a wait) that said item was unavailable for one reason or another.  We were ultimately told that, in fact, only a cheap mesh-back chair was available for us.

We were then told that they could not spend any more time on us, as it was now close to closing time, and told us to leave.

We are not difficult customers, and we came in happy to spend money and with a simple request (a chair).  We left frustrated and without making any purchase.

This store has been our go-to for many years, and we have been valuable customers.  We will no longer shop here.<//Review>

Parking lot in front is convenient and I always get the services or items that I need at a reasonable price.  Staff hustles between printing, shipping and retail - doing a good job.  Of course, it helps if customers are patient with short wait.</text>

<Text>Most of the time at least one of my items was not available when I chose store pick up so its a little annoying. Some floor staff used to follow me like I was going to steal something -_- so annoying get out of my face... s

5-Stars for Victor who is usually working in the copy/print side! He is one of the reason I haven't gone to staples and rate them this high, he has amazing customer services friendly and bilingual and always has great answers. Whenever I have an idea of what I need but not exactly sure of the exact product he always points me in the right direction and I end up very happy with the products he recommends.

If you need help ask for Victor.

Other than that, it is disappointing to walk in to this store when Victor is not there to help.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80857ece65f26f19:0xbe96dc805f12f8ec< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>Always bad. Prices too high, product selection extremely poor, staff ignorant, product quality unbelievably bad. Latest and last encounter with this miserable place, after waiting more than five minutes in checkout line, they would not sell me the three ring binders I had taken from the shelf. The stated reason: they were part of a six binder set they would not break up.<//review><Date>1477439089443</Date>< Pictures>

It's office depot.. I feel the same way about office depot as I do about Radio Shack, it's a company that just needs to die already... It exists due to inefficiency.< /Text>

Seems understaffed towards the end of the day so it takes a long time to get rung up -- especially frustrating when you're just running in to get one thing! Staff are decently helpful, however.<//text>

If I could give them 0 stars, I would. This place is unbelievable. They treat employees like children and they run the place like a daycare. Ridiculous. They cheat you on hours and pay. Don't work here. Ever. Period.</review>

The dispatch says 6 am to 6 pm first come first serve. I arrived first truck at 10 am. it took 4 people at the front gate to check me in all running to the truck like I was the ice cream man they been waiting for all day. It seemed like it was there first day and did not have any clue what there job was. Is was given 2 different directions buy two different people on where to go from there. I was informed my load would be a while because the packing people did not start packing till 9 am. It is now after 2 and I saw one truck leave the dock.<//Text>

< Review>
So right now this is strictly a review on the Maintenance employee Richard! I put in multiple maintenance request on a Saturday (5/22) and Richard came on Sunday (5/23)  and completed almost all of them that same day (one couldn't be done because it's only through management and the other one he came back the next morning and completed it!) . For one of the request, I put in a request for a new fridge light bulb because I thought just the light died. Well, turned out the outlets were out and the fridge was completely off! He was going above and beyond to make sure we weren't left with the possibility of food spoiling. Unfortunately, it was a little more complicated than he thought at the time and it was close to clocking out by the time we realized it was the outlets. So, we plugged the fridge in another outlet and he communicated to us that he'll be back first thing. He came back on Monday (5/24) and everything was sorted out in like 15/20 minutes, if that! Ah, It was really unexpected of him to show up on Sunday but I'm so thankful that he showed up because I honestly didn't realize that the whole fridge was out!

I really appreciate that he communicated with me through each of the request and made sure each was done properly. Richard went above and beyond to make sure everything was good and done! Awesome service! Thank you Richard! (:<//Review>

The team at Granada villas is absolutely PERFECTO. The team services approximately 500+ tenants while maintaining an efficient and expedited renters experience. I am active duty military coming from overseas (Germany) and did not have a very pleasant house-hunting experience especially being short on time with a 10 day limit… COVID had all these bums living rent free… and I was on the verge of paying every last dime I had to secure SOMETHING. I was truly in a predicament and almost forced to deal with suspect ridge aka Sunset ridge…… BUT the ultimate trio, Maria Padilla, Elaine Garcia, and Melissa Rodriguez… saved my absolute sanity, removed all worst case scenarios, and got me in and out within a 3 day time period. I wish I would have came across their availability first because they truly exhibited the definition of professionalism, compassion, and real genuine understanding. Too all my MILITARY folks. Come here. I def spent days going through every single google page; none offered valid reviews that were genuine and helpful. You will pay for the quality for sure and it’s here. Each apartment is well inspected and they have been super supportive and maintain communication which is extremely IMPORTANT. They also offer a very friendly and welcoming atmosphere…(could be cuz I gave them my money for a home…. Will keep y’all updated ;))

I’m 2 weeks late to this review but all jokes aside they are everything I needed and should’ve found when I first moved here to California from across the road.. Cheers to them taking my money 🍺 …. Maybe I’m blessed with a tenant appreciation rent free deal.

Hope this help future tenants!<//text>

I have been all over town trying to tour somewhere. I called Granada Villas and I was able to schedule a tour. I went to the property and notice how beautiful the Apartment Complex is and how well decorated and modern the office is. I loved the office staff, I spoke to all the ladies there. (Maria, Elaine and Melissa) They were very sweet and even tho they don't currently have a 3 bedroom I will be renting once something opens up. Their energy and vibe is out of this world. Thank you Ladies!<//Review>

Want to take the time to thank Maria and her crew for helping me and my roommate threw this process. They r very profesional and helpful.

I have been living here at the Granada Villas for around three years and I absolutely enjoy it. I have not had any issues with my neighbors. Management is great! the Assistant Manager Melissa is very professional , and always tries to do the best she can for the residents. Always in a positive mood, willing to help. Maintenance keeps this place up very well compared to some apartments in the Lancaster area. I would definitely recommend this apartment complex to my family and friends because the staff here is what makes Granada Villas GREAT!<//Text>

He wanted me to check his mail, his car and apartment. He emailed one of the girls that works in the office her name is Maria to let her know I was stopping by and to let me borrow his key. I was a bit lost because it is a big community I’ve never visited but she was so professional and very helpful she gave me a map with indications and she even let me in the mail room which is lock with a key only residents have. I liked that this community looks so secure and beautiful at the same time. If I would ever move around the Lancaster area I would 100% recommend Granada Villas. What a beautiful place and the people that work there seem so happy and love what they do. Great job!<//Review>< pictures>

This place... super peaceful. Moved in in Dec 2019. I love the grass and the sidewalks to walk my dogs! I love sitting on the patio drinking my tea and feeding the birds and squirrels in the shade of the trees. This is exactly what i needed. Price is great for what you get. The office staff is super nice. Melissa and Maria. Rudy and Chris take great care of my work orders. My Pommies just love them. and yes. I do want to talk to the manager (brandi). Her outfits are superb!
I'd definitely hit this again. Two times.< /text>

We just moved here last April. Since then I always feel welcome and at home with the service of Granada villas apartment. The staff and maintenance are very friendly and nice to talk to. Today, The maintenance Chris fixed the vent of my AC and my electric stove. He is very friendly and very efficient employee. I Highly recommend Chris for fxing your apartment. Also, I want to acknowledge Ms. Maria Padilla for always been there to help me on the very first day signing the documents and reaching out to us whenever there some issues with my apartment.

I would definitely recommend Granada Villas apartment a place to lived peacefully and welcome.</review>

<Review>Called to schedule an appoint to look at a 2 bedroom 1 bathroom, was told it is confirmed and to come down to the complex for a viewing. I get there and told them my name and my appointment time and they said they didn’t have my name down and that they had nothing to show. Seriously don’t schedule me to see an apartment and tell me to come down to see it just to turn me away and say you aren’t showing it.</Review>< username>

I've lived here for three years this review is because of the maintenance crew. They are four hard working men that do their jobs quick and efficiently.When they have entered my home they are courteous, efficient and clean up after themselves. I have to write an extra thank you to Roberto because he doesn't just do small apartment  maintenance he also cleans the laundry rooms, the trash centers, and gym when it's open. I've also seen him clean up after other peoples dogs. Roberto always has a friendly smile and wave for everyone. I've witness Roberto stop working to help a neighbor in need. You are luck to this man as an employee.< /review>

I was originally going to just check out their sister property, but I'm glad that Keisha from Granada Villas contacted me. I did visit the sister property but there was simply no comparison. Keisha was so polite, patient, and informed. It was apparent that she really enjoys her job. The leasing office was very inviting with all the Christmas decor. I went on a tour and saw three different apartments and every last one was spacious, clean, and modern. Keisha answered all of my questions and even assisted me with completing my application. I'm currently waiting to be approved, but I'm looking forward to being a resident. I'm from Los Angeles and I have heard horror stories about apartment hunting in Antelope Valley. I'm glad that my experience was great and I would highly recommend them.</Review>

Melissa, Jennifer, and Elaine were just absolutely awesome to deal with. If I had any kind of maintenance issue, packages to pick up, or just had a question they were very responsive and eager to help. I also LOVED the fact that they allow dogs there, it was so nice to see other pet owners such as myself walking their dogs where other places they wouldn’t be as welcome. They helped me all the way until my last day there, and even now while I’m far away they’re still making sure I’m taken care of. Overall with the friendly staff, excellent maintenance crew, and affordable prices they knock other places In the Lancaster area out of the park.< /Text>

Ever since I’ve moved into these apartments in September 2019 I have had nothing but great experiences whenever I need maintenance done they’re always done in a timely manner whenever I have any questions they’re always happy to inform me. Elaine and Melissa have gone above and beyond to help me out with anything that I ever needed especially when it came down to adopting our new pup and adding him to our lease I’ve had nothing short of a great experience. I couldn’t be more happy to call the Granada villas our home! Thank you to Melissa for making the addition of our pup such an easy process.< /text>

I wanted to live here for a while before I posted a comment to give an accurate review. Since I’ve lived here it has been nothing but amazing the maintenance staff itself is fantastic, so helpful always willing to help even if it’s just changing a lightbulb. The main office staff is amazing too super helpful and when it came down to all the paperwork they helped me understand everything I needed. I honestly love living here.< /review>

My fiancé and I were looking for a new apartment in Lancaster and after seeing the grounds of Granada Villas we knew instantly it was the one! The units along with the grounds are very well kept and the staff is beyond helpful. I had the privilege of talking with a few of the women at the leasing office but Maria was the main leasing consultant I went to with any inquiries and questions. I couldn’t have had a better experience with Maria. She was kind of enough to answer my many phone calls and respond quickly to any questions or concerns I had during the application process. She also went out of her way to personally FaceTime me to give me a virtual tour of a potential unit we were going to apply for! My fiancé and I really feel she went above and beyond to help us with any and all questions and although we are not yet living in Granada villas, we couldn’t have had a better customer service experience thus far. We have nothing but good things to say about Granada Villas along with their leasing staff and are very excited to be apart of the community!< /Review>

As a tenant having been here for just over a year now my experience has been incredibly welcoming, warm, and courteous. The apartment staff and others are continuously willing to answer questions, to be of assistance, and are always sincere about offering quality customer service. The apartment complex itself is consistently being taken care of by a small but very active group of maintenance workers that are courteous and ready to complete the job.  The landscaping and cleanliness is also consistently maintained making it a pleasant place to feel at home at. Lastly, the living rates has been appreciable and competitively affordable compared to general rates of local apartment dwellings.< /Text>

<text>If you are planning to move here, there are a few things to consider:

1) If you have a pet, it’s a great place for you!
It takes a small deposit and some addition to your rent which is not really pricy to move you in (breed restrictions apply).
2) Community is quite and tranquil (I like this part the most)
3) Area around is pretty rough (neither ghetto nor nice established district) but it’s the main reason I am giving this place 4 stars rating. I would give even 3 stars but working staff deserves all 5 stars!
4) If you have a dog, right behind the complex there are a few fields where you can take your furry friend to roam and play around (chase rabbits, groundhogs and sometimes homeless people who established there nice outdoorsy camping community).
5) The unit itself is renovated, clean, neat and well designed (the layout). Kitchen has all necessary appliances and tools but comes with an older cabinets that being repainted and refreshed.
6) Staff is really friendly, maintenance guys and leasing office people always responsive and helpful. Just recently forgot a speaker in a community gym, thanks to Orlando, who found it and brought it back to us. I would give this place 5 stars just for people who work here.</text>< Pictures>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>I’ve stayed in two apartments here in Lancaster and Granada Villas is the nicer of the two. Staff and maintenance crews have been extremely helpful and responsive in both apartments. Only downside about Granada Villas is that it’s a bigger complex so the grass isn’t as maintained.

Special shoutout to the maintenance crew (especially Roberto and Ulises) who went out of their way to complete a maintenance request for us.

Would recommend this apartment complex to anyone!< /text>< Pictures>

<review>I have lived in these apartments for a few months now and am really enjoying my stay. The people who work in the office are kind and more than eager to help me out when issues arise. My apartment has met my expectations and when issues do arise the maintenance staff have been nothing short of great especially Robert who is the best and a great person to strike up a conversation with. A nice detail about living here is the green grass and well kept lawns. would recommend checking this place out.<//review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I like the characteristics of my apartment the rooms are spacious and well kept. the management seems nice and appears to handle the business professionally. I didn't feel safe having one lock on the front door they allowed me to add a lock as long as they have a copy of the key. The maintenance personnel do try to keep the grounds clean and well groomed. They seem to be available for any minor repairs and responds quick to any major repairs. However, the neighbors sometimes play their music too loud.or I can hear their personal arguments through the walls or when they bring it outside sometimes to early in the morning.Most of the neighbors do mind their own business and try not to intrude upon others with their noises. There are times when the noise level is down and it is peaceful. I try not to go out at night, however if I have to I try to stay aware of my surroundings and get inside as quick as possible. They do provide a complimentary security officer to cruise through the parking lot and make sure public rooms are secured. I wouldn't say I feel safe anywhere because anything is possible. I have faith enough not to be afraid just cautious. Granada villas is for families keep that in mind and you will find something positive to say about your stay.<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< gmapID>

The community is peaceful, quiet and I enjoy the connivance of the freeway and the shopping centers.

Maintenance is great, they always take care of my service request in a timely matter. Rudy is the supervisor and make sure the work is A1.

The office staff is wonderful, always helpful and understanding. Manny is the man and the ladies Yolanda and Elaine are always cheerful.

I recommend  this community to anyone who is looking for a place to come home to.</Text>

<review>I WOULD NOT ADVISE SIGNING A CONTRACT WITH MG PROPERTIES. The administrators at Granada Villas seem very nice but the property manager is a typical bourgeoisie robber baron. I relocated here from out of state and I admittedly had difficulty finding housing that was accommodating of my large dog, so I settled for one these overpriced, sub-par stucco units. Here is what I have found after two months.

Antiquated features and appliances with quirky defects: refrigerator freezes everything even at the minimal setting, garbage disposal has already failed after two weeks into contract, overhead kitchen vent only works at the lowest setting, stove top burners operate at wildly varying heats, the air conditioner inside the apartment ceiling sounds a lot like a lawnmower engine, air pollutants from ventilation have plagued me with off/on illness for over six weeks and dumps a strange odor into the dwelling, very weak water pressure from both faucets,  the community laundry facility is only open during business hours and gets extremely hot and crowded as well as disgustingly odorous since multiple washers don't drain properly, management will have your vehicle towed without warning because they don't make the effort to maintain a proper tenant vehicle registry, lawn care personnel blow pine needles and debris through my door threshold when clearing the walkways, sliding closet doors are old/shoddy and all of the other pantry/closet doors are assembled with basic spring latches and no bolt catch so they are always slightly open...I could obviously continue but will conclude by adding that this is supposedly a "renovated" unit.

The property manager has a very calculated system of minimal input, maximum cost to the tenant and it shows. You may notice that all of these discrepancies are very borderline complaints: inconvenience at worst. That is exactly what they count on; writing off your complaints as requests of the unreasonable but next year when it's time to re-contract, your rent will be inflated by 20% and none of your concerns addressed. I have confirmed this pattern with a former tenant.

Undoubtedly, someone in their staff will be tasked with tactfully replying to this review in a seemingly civil manner. This is all part of the MG Properties facade. Behind the curtains, it's just another racket owned by some fat cat tycoon in San Diego.

Do your research; rent from someone with ethics. Power to the People</review>< UserId.>

The gym and laundryroom are always clean and well keep by Roberto who is also the porter. Orlando and Ulysses make sure that everything  is always running smoothly. They are wonderful gentlemen doing there jobs in a timely fashion. The property is always landscaped and green, the pool clean and refreshing.

Very overpriced, was told could move in the day we got there and then had to wait 2 weeks after waiting for 4 hours to hear back from them, called them myself after submitting the application and they said (4 hours after telling me we would move in later that day) it will take a couple weeks. Also very loud cars, stereos blasting, and it just feels really unsafe. The keys to the pool and laundry facility don't even work. Can't wait to be out of this lease. Outdated, ESPECIALLY for the price. Would have moved elsewhere but didn't have money to wait any longer. Avoid< /Text>

<text>People constantly fighting every night at 3 am. Loud music bumping in cars constantly. Someone either got murdered or suicide in one of the apartments 200 ft from my place.

<review>Crappy place to live and was overcharged!  Don't bother to voice a concern or a complaint, they will ignore u and act like jerks who have their heads up u know where!  They charge more than the security deposit upon move out, for problems caused by them!  Do NOT rent here, u will regret it!<//review>< Rate>

<Review>im coming on here because i do not think that these apartments get enough credit. i feel like i need to leave a review for the people who are searching for a place and are considerin g these apartments.for one a lot of these review are old as dirt so they are irrelevant. for 2 , i guess gadsden has previously held a bad reputation but i am here to say that from what i have experienced, thats untrue. i just moved to these apartments in february so i am still fairly new. it has just been 2 months. but from these two months, this apartment has been nothing but good. let me address a few of the negative things that i came across when i was looking at reviews on this apartment. first and foremost, i have not seen one roach anywhere on the premises regardless if night time or not. we will see in the summer because thats when they like to come out. for 2. the apartmentis clean. we actually just got our entire parking redone. new fresh ashphault. new paint. new lines. for 3. management is pretty efficient. i hate my neighbors lol and when i went to management about a complaint . my complaint was addressed the very next day. for 4. the front gates are open during daytime but closed and password protected at night to get in. they locked the laundry door now so people cant enter through the laundry room with no key. for 5. people complain about the internet so damn bad and say wifi sucks. but as i said maybe that was just a long time ago or something idk. me and my boyfriend are movie streamers and youtube watchers so when reading reviews about whack internet we were pissed. granada villas Does have a contract with a certain internet provider so there are currently the only wifi service you can get. and they only offer 1meg or 5megs. we have the 5 meg which still seems pretty slow when coming from time warner who gives you 30megs. but we watch youtube videos all the time and stream movies all the time and have NO issue. there are random times where we have to pause the movie ONCE for about 10 minutes to let it load but after that no further pausing or loading is necessary. ummm lets see what else i can say lol basically all of the reviews i have read on here have but nothing but negative and FALSE do not let these reviews scare you away from moving here or even coming to check it out. This is my first apartment and all of the bills are fairly  reasonable. we have a 2 bedroom and pay 801.00 a month for it. our gas bill is 24. electric hasnt gon over 40 YET and the apartment include an electric stove. we have not ran the air or heat yet. i was so worried that me cooking would run the electric bill through the roof. water trash and sewage has been 52 im just trying to give you guys an idea or what it may cost. i hope this review can help someone out there because MY GOODNESS there was not one good review when i was in the same shoes. im giving 4 stars because its only been 2 months idk whats ahead of us during this year lease but at this rate i would give a five. when you move in the apartment is amazingly clean and the management puts a gift basket on your bar counter with a placard with your name on it thats reads "welcome home" the gift basket includes snacks water, chips. its a very nice gesture!</Review>< pics>

<Rate>1< /Rate><text>Rip off Vet. Dr Singh kept us taking our cat to see him ever few weeks plus pay for blood work each time and meds EVEN THOUGH he knew there was no cure or maintenance on what cat had. She was getting worst each week. We finally called SPCA and was told there was no cure and she was suffering as she was losing weight fast. I paid with my own money which was tight.After the suffering he put my cat that I raised since birth and lived over 12 years ... no more. I dislike people who think with their pockets not the pain the pet is going thru.<//text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

<review>Dr. Singh and his staff are all caring and seem to sincerely care for pets. I remember his kindness years ago when Coco was euthanized. Now, he shows the same kindness to Max. Super nice and clean complex also.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< name>

Dr. Singh and his staff have been so great! Our dog is a very anxious one and is very uncomfortable with strangers touching her and in places like the vet. Others have riled her up and turned her away, but Dr. Singh is professional and caring. He has been able to keep her shots up to date when we thought it was impossible. And he has welcomed her in for just regular friendly visits to get more used to everyone. This is definitely the best vet we've been to. The name is perfect, because they do CARE.<//Text>

I had a very pleasant experience with Dr. Singh and all the staff at Animal Care Center. The place is clean and I must say that although I miss Vince's Italian restaurant, this fine Veterinary Clinic is a welcome replacement :)

I can second the reviewer's opinion below about the gentleness of Dr. Singh. I could tell he and his staff love animals by their interaction with my dog and the other animals present. I will bringing my dog here for all future needs.<//review>

Went to Dr. Singh for the first time yesterday. I found absolutely nothing to complain about. The staff was friendly (even after my dog promptly peed on the wall as soon as we walked inside), and the doctor was very gentle with my dog. At the time I'm typing this, my dog is already showing BIG sings of improvement.  Will definitely go back.<//text>

Upon follow-up, the doctor was a bit rough when examining my dog ear. He repeatedly poked at my dog inner ear without consideration while my dog was screaming in pain and turned around snap at him. I was expecting the doctor to be more gentle given my dog is following up after the procedure. It makes me wonder about his professionalism.

Needless to say, I'm not coming back.</Review></record></dataset><record>

<Name>James May (Slim)< /Name><date>1564168783386<//date><Rate>3<//Rate><text>Very pricey, I ended up having to put off getting my Chihuahuas Teeth deep cleaned because of a possible issue due to a heart murmur the Vet had to bring in a Cardiologist for a Echocardiogram in the tune of $500. My finances being on a Disabled Income were unable to have the procedure done for another year and by then, Her teeth had become alot worse. It turns out that six hours later after the Cardiologist did the test, i was given the great news that everything checked out okay and now I have to figure out how Im going to afford all the dental work that I could have afforded to do a year ago. I couldnt even get the psyical report of the Echocardiogram when I went back in to schedule the next appointment for the dental estimate and consultation! All i received was a itemized receipt that was on a single sheet of paper! I feel like it was an unnecessary procedure that i couldnt afford to do in the first place, and now my poor Little girl may very well have to get all Her front teeth removed because they got so bad! Im sorry, its just frustrating and I am in no way ungrateful that He made sure Her heart is strong enough to do the dental procedure, and thats really great news her heart is now okay, but really unfortunate that Her teeth could have been saved if I was able to afford to get them cleaned a long time ago.</text>< Pics>

Dr. Singh is excellent. My dog was treated at FPR for an ear infection at twice the price and it did not get better. When he started yelping i pain, I brought him to see Dr. Singh and this very kind and competent veterinarian was able to help my dog and heal him at half the price of the pricey vet across town and offered me a free follow up visit (to make sure my dog was healing) and ability to purchase additional treatments and reasonable free monitoring. I am very pleased with the care my dog and I received here and they will be our vet from now on.<//review>

< Review>
Never have I been to a veterinary clinic in my life where it felt like my dogs were un- welcome! I brought my service animal in and not only did everybody ignore him, when it came time for his exam neither the doctor nor the technician even acknowledged the dog by name let alone pet him or anything??? They put him on to a table and proceeded to man handle him around! May I say again this is a service dog very gentle loving boxer. I will never ever go back to this place, I think to be a veterinarian or a veterinary technician your first love must be animals! Everyone in that office acted as though it was a chore to even deal with a dog in their presence! What the heck ever happened to bedside manner?<//Review>

Great burger place! If you're looking for a awesome burger and amazing beer battered onion rings, then this place is for you. They also have live entertainment on Fridays and Saturday nights. I was fortunate enough to hear the Jazz Junkies performance the night I was there.< /Text>

<text>First off, we ordered a side salad and got a giant salad which is fine but unexpected. Secondly, all four of the people in my party ordered medium rare, and we all got well-done hamburgers. It seems as if a lot of the money was put into the building and atmosphere  but instead it needs to be put into the development and taste of the food. The taste was mediocre. The portions were decent. I'm not sure if we will be returning regularly.<//text><pictures>None</pictures><time>1498277018035< /time>< rating>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>This is my favorite burger place, period.  Are their portions a bit small for the price, sure.  But their food is quality versus quantity, meaning I don't feel like I had a fatty burger from McDonald's or an all fat pastrami like from the hat.  If you want more food for less, do a $5 deal at your local fast food place.  If you want a quality meal that doesn't have chemicals and fillers and tastes better than a burger from Fleming's, come here.<//Review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

The service was a bit slow, especially because it was pretty empty when we went. No kids menu but they have kids options (grilled cheese, macaroni and cheese, slider, and chicken strips).

Not enough bang for your buck. For 7.95 it's a really small portion of chili fries compared to what you get at like The Hat. The Pepsi here was also not Pepsi. My daughter of 7 also said the same thing after she tasted it. Stay away from the Pepsi. The burger had really good meat, but it was very plain and vanilla on the flavor. Overall will not re-visit. Thanks.<//review>

Food was good
I had the trip tip crunch. Trip tip sandwich with onion rings. Meat was flavorful and tender. Would have given more stars except.. this is a counter order and take a number to your table place. Two parties ahead of is to order, took 20 minutes to get to our turn.
Food did come fast however.
The other issue was the music, had local band ayong, so loud we had to go outside to talk.<//text>

Based on the incredible Angus McCurdy's in Oak Glen and Yucaipa, this place could be absolutely amazing! But, they need to step up their game to be a "restaurant" in Redlands. The food is great, there is a good craft beer selection, and even some choice wines. Now, they need a bigger staff to handle such a big "restaurant" in the heart of the Inland Empire.</text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><review>Ordered a chicken Caesar salad for lunch and a soda, cost me $13.  Quality of chicken breast was decent and it was freshly cooked, but $13 could buy me 2 lunches elsewhere.  Food also took long to come out (party of 3).  Later that afternoon and evening, had major GI pains and issues.  Never eating here again!< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

We came here with a group of people tonight. Best food, best service,  best venue. We are so glad we came here! Highly recommend this place for dinner! Try the tri tip and home made bbq sauce.<//Text>

Love the food here most of the time. Our last trip the tri tip fries had a bit too much dressing on them which caused the fries to be soggy at the bottom.
The staff is friendly. Seems like the seating is a little out of sorts and they're still trying to decide if it's a formal dining restaurant or casual. Lunch hours you order at the register and then seat yourself with a number. Evening, you're seated by a waitress.
The menu you're given in the evening could use some descriptions for some of the items.
Overall I'm looking forward to seeing improvements as time passes and love the food!< /Review>

<Rating>3< /Rating><review>Angus McCurdy's is a hit and miss for me. They are by no means a bad restaurant, but they aren't special. Their prices are a little high for what you are ordering. It's a bit better than a home made burger, but it's not far off from that.<//review>< pics>

This place wasn't extremely impressive. Their food was ok, and kind of expensive for not coming with any sides. I repeat, there are no fries with the burgers!! Blasphemy! Also, they mis-rang us up and couldn't even give us a proper refund to our credit card, gave us cash instead and didn't include the tax we paid for the extra item.<//text>

<rating>1</rating><text>I ordered a Bacon Burger and was asked how I wanted it cooked, I said Medium please, what I got was a shriveled and dried up burned patty with  overcooked bacon that was burned around the edges + a stiff overcooked and stale bun....YUCK ! ! ! Furthermore I had a gift card due to the last screw up and was told that their new cash register system would not accept the cards yet.The person helping me was very nice and accommodating and even gave me a free drink + dessert which was great until I got home and was surprised by the worst burger I have ever had from them.
NEVER have I had any problems with the Yucaipa store,this Redlands store is like a completely different outfit and will surely fail with this kind of experience.....Highly recommend staying away...stick to the Yucaipa store ! ! !<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

<Text>The place is big and had a bar. But not really a bar and not really a restaurant. They're famous for their tri-tip but don't have a tri-tip plate on the menu? Only sandwiches and salads? So confused on so many levels. Tri Tip is good tho.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x80dcaa504141dec7:0xbb8826abeb2728ef<//gmap_id></record>

<review>Had to wait 40 minute's for our meals. I ordered a Tri-tip salad which came without the Tri-tip, and then had to wait longer for them to to correct the problem. Portions are small for the price. My daughter found 2 hairs in her food and there were bees in the bathroom. That's right! There is a hive somewhere in the building, we couldn't even use the restrooms. Their system works in their Yucaipa location., but they need some serious help if they are going to make it as a sit down restaurant.< /review><resp>None< /resp><name>sarah guevara</name><rating>2< /rating><GmapID>0x80dcaa504141dec7:0xbb8826abeb2728ef</GmapID><UserId.>116431960659447051485</UserId.>< Pictures>

Wow, the Dirty McCurdy is the ultimate burger. Tri tip, hamburger, bacon and cheesy goodness. Cherry and/or apple turnovers freshly baked for dessert. Just a warning, nap time afterwards.< /Text>

<rate>5<//rate><review>We were at Angus McCurdy's open mic night as our first time being here.  When we entered the restaurant, we were greeted in a friendly manner, and the waitress explained to us how it works.  You order at the counter, they give you a number to put on your table.  We ordered the tri tip crunch (juicy tri tip on a roll with onion rings and a side of au jus.)  Absolutely wonderful!  And served within just minutes of our order.  The place is decorated nicely and there's plenty of wait staff.  Wish they would add purse hooks in the bathroom, but other than that, we definitely recommend Angus McCurdy's.</review>< pictures>

<text>We decided to take my mother in law out here tonight. We've been to the one in Yucaipa and were looking forward to the resteraunt in Redlands. We ordered the fried pickles, tri tip fries, cheeseburgers, and tri tip sandwich with au jus sauce. Everybody loved what they ordered. They took a while to get our food out. The tri tip fries came out after we had gotten our main course meals. I didn't think that the tri tip fries tasted as good as before. But everyone else disagreed with me. Other than that, we enjoyed our dinner such that we will come back. It has that country western style atmosphere.</text>< Date>

So I made a apt online because it states the business is open at 9am. I even received a email confirming my apt. I get there and text 20 min prior to 9am. Shortly after 9am I get a text saying I’m sorry I’m at work I don’t believe I confirmed your apt. If your not open at 9am. Because you have another job I suggest you change your hours of operation. Will go some place else.<//text>

I care about my eyebrows looking nice! I mean there on my face come on! Lol I’m 25 and only had 2 people do my eyebrows so I was really nervous coming here ! She made me feel comfortable and I got to know her a bit more & it  made me less afraid! I do my makeup the next day and WOW my eyebrows were amazing 🙌🏻🤩 she made my eyebrows look so good and so identical! I’m a happy customer !</text>

I came to Ramneet to get my eyebrows threaded and colored with henna. I was really impressed with the beautiful result. They look naturally bold and perfectly shaped. This lady not only does an amazing skilled job but also shares her wisdom with wonderful rich deep conversations. Will be coming back as a regular client.<//review>

<Review>She is amazing. This is the first time I have gotten my eyebrows threaded without any pain. She is very professional and doesn’t mind coaching you along the way (when and how to stretch skin for threading). Please understand that she runs her business from home; not a bad thing at all but be aware of it. Will definitely be coming back.</Review>< Pics>

<text>I really enjoyed my time here. The first time someone has actually measure my eyebrows and had a good conversation with me. Not just about the money actually cares for clients. Such a good shape and didn’t make them too thin,<//text><date>1591386184808< /date></record></dataset><record>

Don't waste your time. She is very unprofessional & rude. I made two appointment with her & she wasn't there for both. I posted screen shots of our text showing I made the appointments with her. She didn't bother to tell me that she wasn't going to be there for them till after I got there. The 1st time she called me to yell that she doesn't have the time to just do eyebrows for people, she's not a business she has a life & isn't going to not do things because people have an appointment with her. The 2nd time she had her kids tell me she wasn't there & to come back at 5pm.
Fare enough but don't just bail on  appointments you made without telling the client & then yell at them for no reason. It's as simple as "hey I'm sorry I can't make the appointment let's reschedule ".
I wish someone would have gave a heads up that she was like that, I wouldn't have wasted my time.</text>

<review>So I found this place on google seeing almost perfect reviews and currently the only eyebrow threading service I could find open, due to covid-19 others are still closed. As other reviews state it is ran out a room in a single family house. When I originally showed up (after making an appointment of her FB page), no one  answered the door or phone. So my first impression was not professional. I did get a text a few hours later asking what I needed and said to come by. She explained she is a full time nurse and also does this business. Which I guess is why there was no answer earlier. She is nice and personable. I just had my brows done. She did a good job at shaping and trimming them. Very disappointed she over threaded the area on my eyelid, on both sides, and left small cuts and the following day they are still red and very sore!! I have been getting my brows threaded for years and this was one of the more painful  experiences. She offered the two people ahead of me a discount if they did a good google review on her while they were there, which they did (could be why all the 5 stars?). She did not offer me that. She did offer me a dollar off before I got there due to not being at home earlier. So my overall experience was average, especially due to the damage to my skin.< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<Review>She did an amazing job on my brows and lip.  I didn't feel any pain compare to when i used to pluck it.  The studio looks nice and clean. Today was my second time going to her and she continues to provide great results and excellent customer service.  My brows have never been better.  I love it. This will be my go to place now.  Will definitely recommend her to friends and family.< /Review>< GmapID>

Whether you prefer threading, waxing, tinting or healing she does it all. I had the most amazing full face tinting, threading and educational experience today. I wish there was more stars to give. Overall I highly recommend her work to all. Job well done!</Review>

I expected a lot of pain as it comes in a package with threading, however the pain was very little on scale, 1-5 , I would rate it a 1. Highly recommended her! The results were perfect and made sure I was satisfied.<//review>

<Text>I came across this studio on accident and was so glad I did! The last place that threaded my brows did a horrendous job, so I really wanted to find a smaller place that would take their time to fix my eyebrows. Not only was I glad to find how sweet and polite Rammie was, but how professional and caring she was too! I've been to many threading studios, but this was the first time someone actually measured my brows before threading them. Rammie was very meticulous and promised me that, over time, she would get my brows looking full and even again. Look forward to my next appointment!<//Text>< date>

< Review>
Value: 7 was a bit pricey than most juice bars in area but you get what you pay for I suppose.
style/vibe: when I came in I was immediately greeted by a  very polite gentlemen.

Location 8.5 located right off winchester was barely any parking due to trader Joe's sharing same parking lot.

Cleanliness: 10 every table and counter top was clean floors were clean and  I  personally witnessed employees routinely washing there hands before they touched anything which is always a plus.

Final opinion great tasting juice bar definitely top 2  in Temecula in my opinion.  was a bit pricey I paid about 8 bucks for a bowl but ingredients are all natural so I know exactly what is in my bowl.

All in All: Yes I would recommend this place if you have the time and money to get an great tasting smoothie or bowl.  -LawrenceK< /Review>

Always fresh and delicious. Great staff! Very busy area, so parking can be a challenge as trader Joe's and other restaurants or shopping centers share the parking lot.... But you won't be disappointed. Nekter is far better than Jamba juice or smoothie King.</Review>

I thought having a Nekter closer to me would be awesome and simple. However it is not simple, everyone I go in their is always one girl doing all the work while the management is always going into the back doing who knows what. Online ordering is not legit. If you want your stuff done right and fast go to the one off Winchester Rd.< /Text>

We got our first drink free after we downloaded the App! I tried the Pink Flamingo Smoothie; it was good, refreshing but not overly flavorful. My wife got a Berry Banana unfortunately it lacked any flavor. We wished we would have tried the Juice instead of Smoothies. The employees were friendly and helpful.

This is a cheap corporate knock off. They brought out items missing ingredients and said they gave more of others instead of asking us first.

<Date>1518718141470<//Date><Rating>5</Rating><Text>Great friendly service. The long time employees tend to make the juices just right and very consistent. I've had a few issues with some of the new staff where the juices were off and not the usual. Some are willing to fix it. And I've had a couple that were rude about it and don't fix it. But since I frequent this location I just take it as is and cop it to them still learning. And fortunately I haven't seen those rude ones when I've been back. So I would assume they take measures on keeping the staff that are excellent in what they do.</Text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<text>I am someone who really likes yummy over priced smoothies, but this one was just gross. I got the mango delight and it didnt taste like mangos at all it tasted like pineapples and milk it was pretty gross and got too acidic in my mouth so i didnt finish it. I was really disappointed i was expecting a lot more from nekter since theyre a chain. And it was a lot more pricey than other places. :( i really wanted to like this place but it just was not good.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>{'time': 1503518670314, 'text': "silvia ascencio, we appreciate you bringing this to our attention.

<text>Ok, not sure where to start, I got mixed feelings.

I was here almost 3 years ago on a Sunday morning for the very first time, and yes, I loved it, reason why I was back today.

Since then, I have been back to Paso about 4-5 times and I was not able to get a reservation again because L'Aventure was always sold out which is great, I guess people love it.

I decided to drive into town today from LA to treat some friends with a great wine experience. I gave L'Aventure a call in the morning to see if they could accommodate us even though they were booked for the day online. Nicole graciously was able to find a spot for us towards the end of the day. I give them credit for that, maybe because I mentioned I was there before, that I love the scenery and was planning on joining the wine club, I don't know if that was the ultimate reason but yes, they got me in. Thank you for that Nicole!

We showed up right on the dot, sat and the whole flight was provided in a nice woody tray. She recited what the wines were, I mean the names of the wines; no further explanation about the wines, the story behind L'Adventure and how they differentiate from their neighbors. She didn't offer nor make any interest about selling the wine club to me, even thought I had volunteered earlier in my call I was interested on joining the club.

To be honest, it was like from day to night, comparing my first experience to this one, even the wines tasted like whatever today.

My recommendation to Stephan(L'Adventure's owner), please send your tasting room employees to your "Favorite Neighbor"(Booker), like the way they refer to L'Adventure, so your employees could learn customer service etiquete from them.

Ok, long story short, after we finished the tasting, I went inside, pulled my credit card out, paid and more importantly I was not asked if was interested on buying anything or if I wanted to revisit any wine, etc.

My recommendation to other wine lovers who are coming down to Paso, stay away and certainly visit other wineries such as Alta Colima, Law or Booker. You will appreciate my recommendation.<//text><username>Frank Garcia</username>< UserId.>

< Review>
Loved this winery!! Went there with my wife and if was GREAT, the staff was super welcoming, Martin facilitated the tasting and was super knowledgeable and lovely to chat with. The wines are on the more expensive side compared to other wineries but you pay for quality. Definitely recommend</Review>

<text>We read the one bad review and could not disagree more.  Leanne helped us, was incredibly nice and spent most of the hour tasting with us.  Great stories and gave the Winery a personality that was fun and infectious.  However all that does not really matter because the wine is amazing.  It could have been terrible service (it wasn’t obviously) and we would still recommend this winery because the wine was just that good.  The icing on the cake was that the COVID protocols at L’Aventure were the best we have experienced so far in Paso Robles.  It is a must visit!</text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80ecdae5a85d2763:0xd9bce66104f42e77<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Open by appointment only, L’Aventure offers a couple different flight options featuring all red wines crafted from their estate vineyard fruit. The full-bodied and elegant wines are Bordeaux blends, Rhône blends, and a mix of the two. A tour of the caves dug into the limestone hillside is amazing!<//Text>< Pics>

One of our favorite wineries in Paso, producing sublime Rhone style white, lovely and fun rosé, and big, exquisitely made red blends. Buy a bunch of Estate Cuvée and lay it down and forget about it for 5 years.<//text>

We had a great time tasting at L'Aventure last week. The wines are bold and the tasting room is stunning.  Our host was very knowledgeable about wine and made our experience great!
As luck would have it we forgot our tablet there and they had closed for the day by the time we realized.  The next morning we showed up and they had put it in a safe place for us.  Thanks again to the staff for taking good care of our tablet!<//Text>

Love this place. The wine is very sophisticated and made with an enormous amount of knowledge and experience. The richness of flavors can only be created by the best students of enology.

The richness of fruit and the balance of tannins create a wonderful glass of wine. The flavors we tasted drove us to think of the meals we will be creating and sharing with family and friends.< /Text>

Definitely in the top 5 wineries in Paso Robles.  The wines poured are young but a bit of patience will reward greatly.  Cellar 3 to 5+ years and enjoy! Staff is top notch as well.<//Review>

<review>This vineyard is what got me into truly appreciating wine.  France wine maker who takes an old world approach to making exceptional full bodied Rhone varietal wines!  Their location in Paso provides a great get away into the hills, they are also in the process of giving a cave in the hill side which will provide a great setting to sample their selections.  L'Aventure is a MUST visit if you are in Paso.<//review><Rate>5<//Rate><user_name>Travis Smith</user_name></record>

It helps that the staff are fantastic, and the wine is k-iller. Seriously, I don't usually drop $80 on a bottle of wine but this is the exception. No harsh sales pitch, no merch, and a lovely time. Ample parking, because you MUST make a reservation. They're always busy, don't be that guy.</Text>< Pics>

The wife and I were having an anniversary getaway in Santa Barbara and while visiting Jamie Slone we were told that we needed to visit L'aventure. The tasting room is appointment only so I made an appointment for the next day.

L'aventure is a bit out of the way, you even travel on a dirt road for part of the way. But when you finally arrive at the wooden gate and drive up to the tasting room you'll swear you hear angels singing softly.

The facility is nestled between 2 vine covered hills in an idyllic setting. Just stop and take a look around before you begin your tasting. This can't help but put you in the right frame of mind. The tasting room is a modern marvel of sleek concrete and glass.

We were about 10 minutes late for our appointment as the drive from Santa Barbara took a little longer than expected but we were greeted immediately and got taken care of by Leanne. She was a fountain of knowledge about  L'aventure and wines in general. We had a great time getting to know her and the winery. All of the wines we tasted were excellent. We especially liked the Cote de Cote and the Estate Cuvee, smooth mouth feel with big, velvety fruit. For years I've said that my limit for a bottle of wine was $50. The Cote de Cote and Cuvee were both $100 and I bought a bottle of each. That's how good they were.

Who would have thought that little old Paso Robles would become a hotbed of wine production but it certainly has.  If it weren't for recommendation of Jamie and Kim at Jamie Slone we never would have found about this diamond in Paso.

Why are you still reading this review? Call L'aventure and make an appointment of your own. You won't regret it.<//review>

<Gmap_id>0x80ecdae5a85d2763:0xd9bce66104f42e77</Gmap_id><Review>With so many wineries around, why go to a specific one? My husband really enjoyed the wine here, but the elitist energy was extreme, and I did not care for the environment, nor how we were treated. We are in our early 30s and were seemingly pegged walking in as unlikely customers to buy a bottle. I watched two workers pour for other couples and tell stories about how the winery started, show maps of the property and discuss where different grapes were grown, etc, and we were given intermittent pours with no information. When we actually DID buy a bottle, the employee Martin who "served" us seemed to be embarrassed and apologized for not "giving us as much time as he wanted." Well, he had one other couple to serve, so really, there was no excuse for treating us so rudely. Wine may be of quality, but service was not.</Review>< userid>

Great food, great service. Fast service too considering I went during the dinner rush hour. It seems a bit pricey at first but the food is definitely worth it! Tons of options and a few unique burgers too. I believe they also have vegetarian burgers as well which is a nice inclusion to have for vegetarian people.
Outdoor dining during Covid is nice although it can feel a little cramped but definitely one of the better restaurants to go to during this time. They have a firm grip on the situation and have barriers between tables as well which I haven't seen in many other places.<//Review>

$20 for a burger and fries. Burger was not hot and a bit bland. Both times I’ve gone they have either gotten the order wrong or we wait an hour for food. But their patio is adorable!< /text>

There's a wide variety of burgers as well as beyond burgers for the vegetarians out there. It's really appreciated how they have a lot of choice for patties as well as sandwiches if you're not looking for a burger. Service was also exceptionally fast which was a pleasant addition to the dining experience<//Review>< name>

It's unusual when literally  (in my opinion) everything they serve is good to excellent. Service is fast and friendly. I recommend the fried veggie basket to go with your burger.</review>

Burgers arent really anything special. They look good but the meat was flavorless. They are super overpriced. $14.50 for a burger not including soda or fries. Theres alot of other places out there this just isnt it< /text>

<review>SO worth the money. Had the voodoo burger and curly fries - fresh, delicious, and enough to take home and eat another whole meal (all for $17). Very casual and welcoming atmosphere with lots of families.< /review>< pictures>

<review>Why: So in hopes of finding a new "The Melt" in Berkeley after it closed on Telegraph Ave I decided to try this place out.

Notes: Atmosphere was amazing so cute and beautiful for a restaurant.

Food: Huge Huge Huge sandwich portions. I was pretty surprised that they brought me a huge plate of sandwiches for a 1 order. Fries where very well cooked they were also a huge portion. Great portions for what your paying for.

Will come back here !<//review>< Time>

<Review>Barney's is good. California burger with grilled poblano chile, jack cheese and 6 strips of bacon. Really couldn't believe they put so much bacon on my burger, that was totally awesome! French fries were very good, excellent portion. My server was great, refilled my ice tea three times. I definitely recommend Barney's on Shattuck.</Review>< gmap_id>

This Barney's the most popular one situated heart of Berkeley even a mile away from cramping downtown.
Foods and atmosphere is always exiting. Also the outside patio's cool sufficient place to enjoy. Very American👍</text>

Good basic menu of salads and burgers. I highly recommend the Chinese Chicken Salad or the Salmon Burgers. Both are freshly prepared to order  and full of natural flavor. The steak cut fries are the best in Berkeley that I have tried. Large portions - small to medium eaters can easily share. Good small selection of beers< /Review>

Prepare to drop $25 for a half pound burger and onion rings, $7 for a milkshake. If you can get past that, prepare for some truly amazing food! This time I  had a Caribbean burger, filled with grilled jerk rubbed veggies, and a well done (my choice) flame grilled patty. The basket of huge, perfectly cooked onion rings topped with melted parmesan cheese would have been  enough without the burger.  Still, looked forward to having half the burger for dinner. This is not a place to go all the time, but you owe it to yourself to see how well a burger can be made.<//text>

<date>1582609227977<//date><rate>5</rate><review>This is my go-to place whenever we have people visiting Berkeley and want to get a large group together to eat. They always seem to have just enough space to fit our group, ranging anywhere from 4-10.

They have a great selection of burgers, all of them great. My personal favorites are Maui Waui, Baja, and Hickory.

The fries are delicious and come in huge portions. We usually get a full size serving of fries to split. The only fries I wouldn't recommend are the truffle fries. You can smell the truffle oil, but it doesn't really impact the taste, especially if you're going to be dipping them in ketchup.

Really generous portions. Expect to be stuffed by the time you're through with your burger and fries. If you get a shake in on top of that...well, good luck. I still feel full by the time I should be eating my next meal.</review>< pics>

We got to the restaurant and it's pretty amazing! There is a great patio area and in the restaurant is cozy with wood furniture and a fireplace. There isn't a lot of street parking in this area but there is a Safeway right across the street.

The servers were really attentive to our needs and were really quick at taking our order. Food came out super quick. We ordered curly fries, the Big Barney, and the Voodoo Burger. The fries were on our table in less than 10 minutes and the our burgers were there in another 10 minutes. The fries were super fresh and hot. The ranch they have for it seems homemade and pairs well with the fries. Our burgers were hot and juicy. I would have liked my bun to be toasted and the pattie to be more heavily seasoned but it was still an excellent burger and nothing a salt shaker and pepper grinder could not fix (they were already there on the table along with ketchup, mustard, Dijon, and Tabasco).

Overall we had an excellent experience and I'm sure we'll be back soon.</Review>

<Review>I had a cinnamon milkshake and onion rings. The milkshake was made with vanilla ice cream and some cinnamon sprinkled in. It was fantastic. Their onion rings were really really good. People all around me raved about their burgers, sandwiches, and salads. Relaxed place. Food came out quickly. Good service.< /Review><rating>5< /rating><Date>1560143737238< /Date>< name>

They catered to us being vegetarian/vegan. They have those option for any burger style. You'd have to reserve a table if possible specially if its a big party as they get full pretty quick. Fries were cooked perfect. Very friendly owner and works with his employees well.< /text>

And the taste is legit. But one serious issue would be that they use plastic packaging for hamburgers to go. The problem is, when you arrive at home and wanna take a bite of it, the bottom side of the burger is already soaked by some humidity and heat from ingredients of the menu, which is gross.The packaging issue nearly got me lower the rating to 3 stars. Honestly, I would like to give 3.5 stars. Also, I would like yo add that if superduper burger was nearby my place, I would not have even tried here... Anyway so far I just tried one menu so let me try some other menus and update this review.</review>< rating>

Used to be really good, but the quality of the burgers has declined a lot. The last two times they served me a burned burger or burned to a charcoal bacon. When I complained the manager explained to me that's how they cook the bacon because it's done in butches. I don't care how they cook it honestly, I care about how it tastes, if I can eat it that is. I guess my choice is not coming back</Review>

I've eaten at Barney's on a occasion while working in Berkeley and about once a year since retirement. They have always served an excellent burger. (Pricey, too.) Today's lunch was not their best.

I ordered my burger medium. What I received was well-done. Dry and crumbly and very chewy around the edges. Not suitable for a $15 burger. It was bacon-chedder on a gluten free bun.

Service was excellent. Kept this from being a 1-star review.< /review>

Always ordered to go, but the food was usually pretty good. Either way, it's the best place to get a burger in Berkeley. There's a large number of options to build a burger from. Multiple buns, meats, etc. The fries aren't anything special but still go well with the burgers. Always a good option for food, but just check your food before leaving to make sure it's all correct.<//text>

The veggie burger was better than I remembered 10 years ago! We ordered ahead. Phone service was prompt and courteous. Burger was ready for pick up at appointed time. Overall, a great take out experience, although a little pricey. Two vegan burgers and fries were around $28.<//Review>

Good spot for a big burger and lots of different sides, and sports viewing. Service was pretty good, the bathroom was kind of weird, but that's besides the point. One thing, I would suggest putting lettuce on the lower bun when someone orders a burger medium well, my bun was soaked through before I picked it up.<//Review>

<Review>Ooops!!  The review I submitted for The Local Butcher Shop was actually meant for Barney’s.
The 2 business’s are next door to each other and I had the names confused.  Apologies to Barney’s
for the error.  However!!  The critique remains
the same..... Fabulous burgers!!  The best. I’m looking forward to my next visit.<//Review>< gmap_id>

Now I know why everytime I go on about a giant hamburger someone asks me if I've been to Barney's — these are burgers of epic proportions! I had the Morrocan burger, which was spicy, and topped with provolone and 1000 Island dressing (my prime condiment weakness). Barney's gets extra points for having gluten-free buns, and knowing which of their many fry options are *actually* gluten-free. Grass-fed beef, turkey, salmon, and garden (also Beyond) burgers make it possible to kick back for burger time with anyone that isn't a Breatherarian. The salads look equally as amazing, but I never made it that far and I had enough lettuce on my burger to satisfy the customary vegetable requirement.</text>

<Text>This was one of the best burgers I've ever eaten. I got the Gastropub Burger, a 1/2 lb of Certified Angus Beef cooked medium, served on a pretzel bun and topped with provolone, bacon (perfectly cooked and flavored), a fried egg, and blackened potato chips. It was as red, juicy, and flavorful as you could wish. The steak fries were the Platonic ideal of steak fries. The chocolate milkshake (served with a spoon and with the extra in a blender cup, like it should be) was thick and rich. The atmosphere - wood tables and beams, with a roaring fire - was warm and comfortable, and the staff were smiling and hospitable. This place is exactly what a gourmet burger restaurant should be.</Text><user>101809250665838236457</user><Gmap_id>0x80857ea10eb777ab:0xabdec8f3a0b2a828</Gmap_id><Date>1549918060181</Date>< username>

<Review>Middle of the pack in terms of burgers in Berkeley even though it's been around for decades. Too many choices. Though their milkshakes are awesome. Though I'm not complaining their portion sizes are gargantuan. No wonder there's an obesity epidemic in America. Too much red meat and carbs.</Review>< pics>

The food was good but our waitress didn't ask us not once if I wanted a refill or if I needed more napkins,or if everything was ok . I was finishing my drink when she brought my husband and I our bill. I felt like she wanted us to hurry up and eat. I actually wanted another drink and so did my husband . We ended up leaving and going to another place to enjoy ourselves.  I can't remember her name but she was an Asian lady with blond hair.<//review>

Barney's has a nice, eclectic atmosphere inside, and a lovely patio outside. The burgers and sweet potato fries were decent, but not "OMG, this is amazing, I have to come back here" good. I probably won't eat here again, only because there are other eateries I truly love in the same neighborhood. (If you're an onion ring aficionado, the ones here are beer-battered, which are definitely harder to find.)<//Review>

<review>Great old-timer Berkeley favorite for lunch. It may also be good for dinner but I have only done lunches here. The name says 'burger' but it is much more. Awesome healthy salads, hearty soups, wooden rustic space with high ceiling, warm and cozy ambiance, and great service. I'm part of a Thu group lunch here and look forward to it.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x80857ea10eb777ab:0xabdec8f3a0b2a828<//gmap_id></record>

Love the variety here. Sometimes burgers can be a little undercooked (despite asking for well-done), but not terribly so. If you order in, there are sometimes mix-ups but they have a huge volume most of the time, so I can forgive that.

The burgers themselves are really good and large. My favorite is the french burger - baguette bun w/ blue cheese. Curly fries are awesome.</Text>

If I'm completely candid I miss some of the back in da day stuff,  before they consolidated the menu.  There used to be a greater variety of burger types (2 vegan options instead of one, more meat/fowl ones as well).
However,  our server was exceptionally nice.  I would be sad if I returned and she wasn't available . She was so patient with our party,  offered suggestions,  went beyond the basics to ensure a satisfying meal.  The portions are still generous,  the prices reasonable, the seating at the location accessible,  armless chairs (varies not true for all their venues).
Everything was good.  If you want a burger with lots of choices for individualizing the condiments,  sauces,  embellishments - erm I mean toppings,  this is the place.  You'll leave super full!</text>

<Review>Burgers done right.  Not fast food, not pretentiously "foodie", and not like diner food.   Just high quality beef, flame - broiled to order, with all the trimmings you could want available on the side.   The fries and salads are generously portioned and delicious as well.  A good selection of beers to complement the meal.   And because this is Berkeley,  there is organic Kombucha on tap.< /Review><Rate>5<//Rate><UserId.>115102846802370022981</UserId.></record></dataset><record>

Delicious burgers, great sides, good atmosphere. Sometimes the burgers seem a little over-complicated, with a few too many options. Might be nice to see them focus in a little bit more. Still, it's great. If you are in the mood for a burger (especially a weird burger) you won't go wrong here.< /Text>

Came down to visit from Boston.  Was wondering what was a top burger place here in the bay area, and I must say the burger I got from here was absolutely delicious. Service was excellent and quick and enjoyed the environment in the restaurant. I definitely recommend this place for the burger lovers.<//text>

Barney's has excellent food , I usually split a salmon burger and steak fries with a friend.  Sometimes I get other food but usually split with a friend.  The service is fast and friendly.  There is sports on the tv's (3) and a fireplace.</review>

<text>These are the burgers you salivate about when you're hungry. Generous portions of toppings on every burger, I especially like the Alpine burger with the loads of mushrooms.

Sides are pretty good as well, try both the curly fries and the sweet potato fries.

Probably the best place to get burgers around, with the possible exception of Eureka based on preference.< /text><Time>1447667223899< /Time><rate>5<//rate><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

My grandchildren took me for my birthday. The spinach salad is just as fresh and delicious as years ago, when it was my favorite choice for lunch after jogging around lake Merritt. I was presented with a surprise sundae with a candle, compliments of the restaurant ( my grandkids did not request it, so one of the servers is very observant), after the meal. Highly recommend! thanks!<//review>

Great burgers. Baja is my favorite. Always crispy bacon, lots of avocado and cooled the way you ask for it. You can substitute any kind of meat on a burger or go vegetarian. Sweet potato fries are great. Service is sometimes a little slow but it's usually because they are busy.< /Review>

Barney's are great but I prefer this one to the Solano location because they have a much better beer selection (two rotating fieldwork ipa taps among others).  Curly fries are a must.</review>

The rings come in the size of your fist, full of flavors and requires couple bites to consume these goodies. The hamburgers are not bad, but onion rings and fries are the must haves.

I had a celebration here for a party of 50 one time. Barney's has a banquet hall in the back of the restaurant and it is the perfect place to have a big gathering. The hosts were super helpful and accommodating. They even allowed us to use their TVs to play our own slideshows.</review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x80857ea10eb777ab:0xabdec8f3a0b2a828</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Most of what you get will be good, except the regular sandwiches are just okay. Shakes are particularly good. The acoustics in the place aren't fabulous, so it can get a little bit noisy, but there's outdoor seating.</text>

Quickie:
+ Lived in North Berkeley for 3 years during college and only one block away from the Gourmet Ghetto - so to say I frequented Barney's is an understatement.
+ Friggin' amazing burgers

---

Food:
What can I say? The burgers are delicious as are their fries (both steak cut and sweet potato). It's hard to narrow down but I think the French burger is my favorite (Crumbled Bleu cheese and bacon, yum). But in the number of times I've been there, I've probably tried over half the menu and my friends accounted for the rest. Always spectacular, very different combinations - just an all-around nice burger joint.

Overall:
They do take-out. as well, so if you have a midterm to cram for back at home, just call in and pick up in 15. All in all, Barney's is a great alternative to a greasy fast food burger - they do gourmet on a broke college kid's budget.</Text>

Spent 20 dollars on a burger and fries and hot water bottle..  Got home and was sick to my stomach.  Went to the ER and for sure it was food poisoning symptoms.  This was not a great experience for me and it's horrible as I speak now. Over priced and I am paying for it in pain at this hospital.. Don't eat here.  OMG 😱<//Review>

The burgers are excellent. I can't get over how big they are. I had to cut mine in two and have the leftovers for lunch the next day. Friendly atmosphere.< /Text>

They have an extensive selection of burgers to choose from with a good selection of patty options: beef, chicken, turkey and portabello mushroom, to name a few.  Their seasoned curly fries and ranch dip keep calling us back!  And their Oreo shakes are a wonderful sweet indulgence.<//review>

The service at this place is not very good, and the food is decent. The Barneys on Solano is better service wise and food wise, but I wouldn't order take out from either, it's always cold.</review>

Fishy overcooked salmon burger that wasn't filling at all. Server wouldn't split check more than 4 ways. Wouldn't let us borrow umbrellas from other tables to shade from the sun, even though no one was sitting there.< /text>

We decided only tip 10% but credit card transaction showed these guys credited themselves 20%.
