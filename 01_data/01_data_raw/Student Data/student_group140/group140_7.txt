Fantastic breakfast. We we in town and walked all the way from our hotel near Chinatown. I was rewarded with a great Ham Benedict and bloody Mary. My girlfriend had the mushroom Benedict w/Mimosa and was equally satisfied. We stayed and watched the rest of the football game and I decided to order a Blue Moon which came with a couple slices of orange (not automatic anymore). It was the perfect start to our day exploring the city.< /review>

Great service! And good food options for a cafe. Also, basic drip coffee is quite good, and the baristas strive to make sure you enjoy all your beverage options. Also, they have good beer on tap.<//Review>

All of the food here is great, but the Quinoa Bowl is a standout - it's a delicious and unique Gaslamp favorite. The service is good and it's a clean, nice little cafe. Definitely recommended!< /Text>

Came here two days in a row for happy hour. First day, the chef left at 3:00 pm, and the next day they were closing their doors at 5:00 pm as we were walking up. Although their hours say they are open for business until 7 , it turns out they don't want our money (or anyone else's for that matter) . The girl locking the door stated it was slow. Weird, I wonder why no one is in there.... Maybe because you close or don't provide food during normal business hours?<//text>

Cute place. It is crowded on weekdays. I really like the place except for two items: Weekend food is sometimes not very hot. the combo "deals" are actually more expensive than the items a-la-carte. What's with that?</text>

I got a Groupon for brunch here as a gift, and I hadn't yet heard of it. But brunch was so good! The burger and fries were really good, especially the fries because I like when they're thin and crispy. We also got French toast and it did not disappoint. PLUS there was no wait, which is practically unheard of at any place that serves brunch. I look forward to going back here.<//Text>

Everything I've had here has been good, from their sandwiches (portobello, turkey club) to their New Orleans style iced coffee. The servers are nice and the place is rarely packed. Their sandwiches during lunchtime are huge, and come with a big bowl of soup or salad. Enough food for two meals!</text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<Text>This is a horrible little dump...basic traditional corner cafe stuff with a quinoa bowl on the menu..a sign that perhaps someone with skill worked there..however we all know its pretty simple to throw cafe food together but what sets this cafe apart and what San Franciscans should not take part in is the human side of the resturant experience..horrible..deplorable management/ownership..staff turnover is tremendous.. ..the owner is a self bloated slob who lords over the place like it is a third world country..imagine when he does turn his head..now do you really want to be in on that plate..I suppose if you are the kinda person that believes employees have no rights...like say overtime pay..then this is your bowl of squirrel..however if you are a himan being of decency you will want to eat elsewhere...Thank you...<//Text><Rating>1<//Rating>< user_name>

Solid menu of breakfast, sandwiches/burgers, and salads, friendly service, open & light-filled space, open late, and best of all, right near my house:   Gaslamp is a great spot in an area that can be a little sparse with commerce.</Text>

<text>Nice digs, but the latte wasn't very hot and was way too expensive.  $4.65 is pushing the prices at Sightglass, which is a similar "nice digs but too expensive" location for so-so coffee. Too each his own I guess. I'd expect this coffee to cost $3.50 maybe $3.95 tops.</text>< pictures>

<Review>Fish and the ingredients were super fresh but it was really bland and the rice was dry.  For the highest ratings in the area I expected better honestly. Unless I had a piece of pickled ginger with each bite it tasted like nothing - except for the three bites that actually managed to have the sauce I ordered on them. Very underwhelming. Also! I was really disappointed I was only given a fork and no chopsticks, lame.<//Review>< Pics>

<Text>This was my first time having poké and it was awesome! The employees were super friendly even though I had no idea what I was doing. I recommend the 1-2-3 tuna; I don't know what it's marinated in, but it's awesome. I also recommend the eel sauce and spicy mayo. Overall a great, quick stop to pick up some poké!<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Poor customer service. The staff did not know what can or can’t be done such as substitutions and were rude. They also could not answer any questions about the menu</text>

<text>I had a huge craving for bubble tea. You can order online or walk-in (very limited on number of guests allowed in at one time). I got their Taro Boba Tea! Loved it so much on a sunny day in Coronado.<//text>< pics>

<review>I was visiting Coronado, but live in OC. I visit poke places weekly, and this is one of the best I've had. Widest variety of protein and toppings I've seen in a long time. Some very unique options, too. I only dropped 1 Star because of price. A large bowl and soda = 20 bucks. Everything on the island is pricy, but that's the most expensive poke quick service I've ever had. They also do 4 scoops of protein instead of 5 like many other places with the same size bowl. Despite the price, I'll be here several more times during my trip.< /review>< Pics>

My poke bowl had some veggies and they put fresh green onions which I didn’t order. I ordered boba tea and didn’t receive it. Now I have to deal with getting my refund. It was my first time to order from here but it is gonna be the last. Disappointed.<//text>

awesome spot to grab a quick bite there or to go! the server was so patient because we had a huge group and she was on top of asking us everything because we couldn't keep track of the menu. lots of yummy toppings and protein options, and reasonably priced! would highly recommend for a chill meal :)</text>

<date>1579640201162<//date><text>A lot of food places in Coronado are I find quite expensive or trading on tourist traffic. We had lunch at Poke 123 and it was a great experience. Very clean, nice outdoor seating area out front. Servers kindly explained ingredients I wasn’t familiar with, they had different marinated ahi tuna , and everything was super fresh and tasty. The miso soup was so full of ingredients! I can’t wait to go back to try their wraps and ‘waves’ as well as the bowls. Also, they have beer! 😀< /text><Resp>None< /Resp>< UserId.>

The variety! There is many delicious picks! I work on the block, and I have been wanting to try it I will be back to try all the options for sure! This spot also offers what they call "waves" looks like a sushi taco comes in 3 pretty long servings. Also what I recognized as sushi burrito. Bobba also sold here (passion fruit, mango,melon, taro strawberry)one of my favorite items I saw on their menu was MOCHI ice cream 3 for $4.49 I consider that a decent deal for mochi ice cream! Just so much goodness in one small shop. Finally I decided on the large poke bowl with 4 scoops of protein for $15.99 the prices are a bit high but the service and quality shows for it.  The bowl was packed with all the great options they had from spicy tuna to fresh octopus.i also saw they have savory meats available like beef. Toppings were interesting with mango salsa as one the toppings available. Couldnt have enjoyed it more. The bobba was refreshing I had the melon which was a little too sweet for me and the amount of bubba was alot for my taste but I will just ask for less next trip ! If you are in Coronado visit poke 1 2 3 it is delicious !<//Text>

went in for a smog. the old man at the counter was incredibly stand-offish and a huge snowflake about his mask. Would rip it off on his way out the door every time even as I follow behind him out the door. Overall poor customer service and the mechanic who performed the test got into my car without a mask on.</text>

Not very helpful or friendly. Had recently replaced the battery which caused the car to fail inspection. That part is not their fault as we should have researched beforehand, however seems common enough that they might consider asking beforehand. Regardless, the problem ensued when we were given advice on how far and long to run the car before trying a retest. Advice failed and different advice was given at time of reinspection failure that same day. Advertised price on their website does not align with price quotes upon arrival. They chalk that up to the online price being a coupon, but that's not clear at all< /Text>

Super helpful. Super quick & honest! Easy to get a retest as well. It's on a first come first serve basis.< /text>

Nothing fancy, but efficient, quick service, and reasonable cost. Have been going here for many years, never had to wait long even though it's first come, first serve, no appointments.</review>

I agree with other reviews, this place doesn't have 5 star personality or 5 star amenities. However, I'm not so sure that it needs those things to be a 5 star smog check. I care almost exclusively about the car and the cost. My experience was great, I can't complain, but I'm not expecting concierge service from a smog check/car repair facility. I was treated kindly, fairly and with respect. That's mostly all I need. I also really appreciate being able to come in without an appointment, and leave within the hour with a smog certificate for registration.<//review>

<gmapID>0x8085b403cd9e22e9:0x1d9bae430ec8617e<//gmapID><review>Was referred to this place by another shop who's machine was down. I should have left the minute I was greated by a grumpy ponytailed guy. Talk about zero personality! I should have apologized for inconveniencing him. Grabbed paper work, scanned and asked for keys. No mention of how long it would take, because if he had I would have left. 4 roll up garage doors and only one machine. Then Goober from Andy Griffith was working the machine and seemed like his first day on the job. It took forever. Then mister personality kept smoking out front and putting 1his cigarette butts right next to where I was sitting....clearly right under a sign that says "this is a smoke free facility"! So in closing, if you like to be treated rudely, waste time and be assaulted by cigarette smell...this is your place<//review>< Pics>

Went in and was met by the pony-tailed ex-biker/hippie guy. Seemed like a jerk, so I left. went down the street to do business with the place on Washington. I'd recommend doing the same.<//text>

Horrible. The people who handled my dog seemed like they hated their job and could care less about what I wanted for my dog. They gave her shots I did not ask for (and charged me) and basically forced their opinion of what I should get for my dog evens though I was very clear about what I needed. They seemed easy and convenient but I do not suggest this place to any dog owner. Terrible service, I am truly disappointed.< /Text>

<name>Kelsey Prescott<//name><pics>None</pics><Date>1579971009296<//Date><Review>Very unprofessional. Canceled their clinic 4 minutes before the pet store opened today. What is the point of posting clinic dates and hours if you are going to cancel when people plan accordingly. My kitten is getting spayed next week and the rabies vaccine they offer there is the live vax- which I refuse to give her, and she needs to have proof of rabies vaccine at the time of surgery or they would have to provide her with that vaccine. I did my research and was so glad to find that this VIP pet care clinic offers the pure rabies vaccine- as many vets and other clinics do not. Thank you vip pet care for making me scramble around trying to find another place to safely vaccinate my kitten last minute due to your unprofessionalism and irresponsibility.<//Review><user_id>103325020378361720598<//user_id>< response>

<text>I went into Pet Supplies Plus on Mopac in Austin, TX to get my little 3.5 lb, 14 year old blind Chihuahua's nails trimmed.  The store brought in VIP Petcare Community Veterinary Clinic that day and they are atrocious.  A vet tech was holding my dog and the Veterinarian was trimming her nails.  Everything was going fine there were literally no issues and then another employee from VIP Petcare Community Veterinary Clinic who was checking people out when they were done must have been bored so he came over to where the Veterinarian was working and told me not to touch my dog….?  My dog is very old and blind and I was simply touching her head and letting her smell my hand so that she would know I was there – she can’t see because she is blind and was scared.  I thought it was inappropriate for this person to interject himself when everything was going just fine and no one had any issues until he showed up.  That conversation got heated because here is someone that is not involved with what was going on telling me to not touch my dog because it’s against their policy and then he actually said “I am not going to get fired because you are violating policy.”  The Veterinarian and the vet tech holding my dog never complained about anything and never said a word before or during this entire interruption.  Immediately after that a girl that had to be in her teens that works for VIP Petcare Community Veterinary Clinic came over and said she is refusing service and told me I had to leave the store – the Veterinarian stood their looking at her completely perplexed as to what was happening.  How this little girl decided this is beyond me but that isn’t her store (she doesn’t even work there) and they had no right to talk to me that way.  I called the store manager after I got home and he had no idea what was going on in his own store and said that they are a franchise and don’t have any say in whether VIP Petcare Community Veterinary Clinic is allowed to work in their store because that comes from corporate.  My takeaway is that if there is an outside company in your business and they are causing you to lose customers because of the ego of VIP Petcare Community Veterinary Clinic employees then you better figure out what you are going to do because this was an epic fail for VIP Petcare Community Veterinary Clinic and Pet Supplies Plus.  Someone that is not employed at that store told me to leave the store because I was touching my little dogs head!?!  Veterinarians are supposed to be there for our animals and this company does not put the animals first in care or comfort when they are treating our loved ones.  Do not do business with VIP Petcare Community Veterinary Clinic they allow their employees carte blanche to treat their patients and owners disrespectfully and Pet Supplies Plus does nothing to manage what they are doing when they are onsite in their business.<//text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

<text>I took one of my cats in here because he and another outside cat got into a fight and he had some bite wounds on his right flank. They took my cat in right away (it was a Friday after 5:00pm) and checked him out. They shaved his fur, examined his wounds and gave him an injection for pain. They also sent home some antibiotics. What I especially liked was that they called my regular vet to let them know what had happened and my regular vet called me to check up on my cat. I thought that was pretty awesome.<//text>< response>

The vet is a jerk. Does not have a very friendly aditude. Would never use again. Took my dog to the shot clinic to save a little money instead of using my regular vet. My family used the same shot clinic several times before with no problem. Took my 2 small dogs and one big dog. My mom waited in line with the two small dogs and I stood off to the side with my big dog. One store over in front of a empty building for lease. I know how some people feel about pit bulls so I was trying to stand out of the way. When I first got there she did bark a couple of times then settled down. Not more then any other dog there. My dog is completely friendly and she is in a house with a Pomeranian and min poodle. The vet come over and told me to move my dog that she was upsetting the other dogs and he did not want her there. At this point she way laying down completely fine.I felt like I was out the way not bothering anyone. I got my money back and left. Waist of a hour. A vet should be impartial.</text>

< Review>
Horribly over priced. I went to another clinic and my dog received a DAPPL, bordatella, and rabies vaccination for $45. They charged me $80 at this clinic, and dropped the needles in a puddle and administered them to my dog before I could even say you need to get another needle. I hope he doesn't get an infection from this. They didn't even give me a real rabies certificate on paper. It was a flimsy receipt. I called them to get an actual rabies certificate so I could travel internationally with my dog if needed and the woman on the phone was arguing with me about it and didn't want to give it to me. I am extremely disappointed. The worst vet care and customer service I have ever experienced.<//Review>

Absolutely awful. I wasn't pleased with the service- the store employees let the vet and their assistants know that we had been waiting two hours before everyone else and that we were first, and we had to wait while everyone else went ahead of us while an assistant launched into a sales pitch on why we should buy their dewormers/preventative stuff even after we continuously said no. The dog before ours pooped all over the table and floor and they didn't wipe up all the poop on the floor- there were still numerous spots everywhere. When our puppy was seen the vet administrated the vaccine within a second and jabbed it carelessly into her causing her to yelp and scream- which she never does with other vets. He also jabbed an oral dewormer into her mouth and sprayed it all over the table/her face and said 'oops.' He didn't even bother to wipe it before saying 'you're good.' I had to say 'it's all over her.' Before the assistant said 'I'll wipe you up to make you more pretty' meaning she KNEW the yellow dewormer was all over her face and coat. She didn't bother to use water and yellow stains were all over her until we took her home and bathed her. We paid for puppy pack 2, which included bortatella vaccine, and the vet said 'we won't give her that one, you can come back and do it later for free since you paid for it.' We let them know that we wouldn't be back as we are from out of town.... later we called to get a refund for the difference and the phone employee was extremely rude and said 'no, you won't get one because it was still cheaper to do puppy pack 2 instead of doing them individually without bortatella. You paid 67, and doing them individually would be 66.' Okay, so it's not cheaper, but fair since we paid only a dollar more for absolutely nothing. so asked if we'd get it free at our next visit. 'No, it won't be free. You'll have to pay for it.' She was rude and talked over me the entire time. I work customer service for medical and if I did that or behaved how she did, I'd lose my job! Overall horrible. You get what you pay for.<//Text>

<Text>First, I was sent a text to my phone stating that I have important mail waiting for me at this location in LA, Ca..
WHEN I SPOKE TO THE COUNSELOR AT THIS LOCATION( 813 E. 4th pl. Los Angeles,Ca)I made it very clean what it was that I needed and for why. Before I could finish what I needed to tell him, he quickly walked away.  I wasn't rude to the man. And I had waited in line for about 40 minutes.  I think they need more employees, handling the dpss clients, at the information area. About 1/2 hour had went by, and then another much older man.  He called my name and told me that I HAD NO MAIL.  REALLY I DON'T THINK THAT EITHER OF THE DPSS PEOPLE EVEN CHECKED MY MAIL. Based on the facts that I am never rude, and the reaction I received from both workers.  I FIND THIS VERY INTERESTING. DUE TO THE FACT THAT I SINCE COVID. I ONLY HAVE RECEIVED MAIL 1 TIME. . And earlier this week I received the txt directly from the DPSS stating I had mail their.  Everytime, I go to this location, I never seem to receive mail. I'm sick of it!<//Text><pics>None< /pics><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80c2c63957e5475f:0xc051c46f9a69878e</gmap_id></record>

<Text>I first started coming here in late 2019, and I most recently came here last month. I needed to reinstate my benefits which stopped because I didn't utilize the services in 2020. I was able to 1) fill out a packet quickly and easily early in the morning, 2) complete my application online, and 3) call and speak to a case worker just to make sure that everything was taken care of since I'm currently homeless, living in a shelter, and in the process of getting my life back on track.<//Text>< UserId.>

I guess they are doing best they can under coronavirus situation.

Expect over an hour wait in line outside.
They handle everything over front door.< /text>

<text>Unfortunately I misplaced my identification and with it my E B T card, so after searching I decided to visit the DPSS office. The bldg is still closed due to covid-19 so all business is conducted on the sidewalk thru metal gates at the exit. I know that it's not the workers' fault for the conditions but I have to give them credit they were courteous and prompt. The line had around 15 people and my business was completed in about 45 minutes. I walked away with DMV info., and to return for a replacement card the next day as the card machine was not working. How ironic it was that when I returned I found the items that I misplaced. 😁<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

<text>The Sheriff's Dept. was running some kind of training exercise there today. Delayed for an hour. (2/18/21) 12:30 pm. I have been to this location and have applied for benefits there. Except to be here for at least four hours to apply for Calfresh, General Relief, and Medi-cal. Bring two forms of ID (CA ID and SSN cards).<//text>< user_name>

IT’S VERY OBSCURE/Difficult to locate.
There is NOTHING about this place that says ‘Welcome We’re here to assist you’.
Benefits are meager in the extreme. Staff are as friendly and alive as Cement.
TON’S of paperwork to finalize ‘I’m Homeless & have no income’. Then one may receive $221.00 a month, and $191.00 in food stamps. It’s demoralizing and heartbreaking. $221.00 monthly, it’s insane.
Miguel (GROW Staff) was very contagiously upbeat, positive, friendly, empathetic and contentious. Seems he really cares.< /Text>

<Text>This place..........  IDK

Really have not had any problems with staff or case worker, after coming here nearly five years. Sometimes packed, sometimes not. Observing staff(Government  slaves) you could tell they are there for the Paycheck of course. Other then that, they really need to consider Wifi for the public.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80c2c63957e5475f:0xc051c46f9a69878e</gmapID></record>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>I went there and they helped me out huge! They even told me stuff I qualified for that I didn't know about or ask for. Then that stuff helped me out greatly later on in life. They care alot. Yea it's kinda slow but all places like this are. If you get their early it is better. Just be nice and patient. Bring a book if you get bored easy.<//Text><gmap_id>0x80c2c63957e5475f:0xc051c46f9a69878e< /gmap_id><pics>None< /pics><Time>1460449949370</Time>< resp>

This place does what it's supposed to do. Take applications for general relief, a grant for single people without children. (Max$221.00 cash aid per month) and Cal-fresh(food stamps max 192.00)For families with children the aid varies depending on other variables, but largely on the number of children under 18 yrs old.  You can also apply for Medi-cal here.  They offer some supportive services for mentally/physically disabled persons(if this is you, ask them about the "needs special assistance" program, which will save you the trouble of job search requirements if you qualify. They will also connect you with a referral to an SSI advocate, pending a SSI case. This is not a permanent income source. It is merely a grant/loan(it must be repaid) to you to help with basics while you seek employment or approval from SSI. They do not offer case management or social workers. Although you could be referred to some other agencies thru them. Housing assistance is very limited. The Pilot program is available for work eligible participants enrolled in the grow program. Emergency shelter and food vouchers are available for a two week time period...the value of which, will be deducted from your first general relief and food stamp allotments. If you do not expect more than I've outlined here, you won't be disappointed. Yes, you do need identification. And yes you are dealing with government employees who are in  thankless positions and are not able to go beyond the restraints of their positions....most do not show joy in it. But few will be offensive to you either unless provoked. You can not take lighters or any sharp objects through security. You must go thru a metal detector. Also any type of chain..whether it be considered a wallet anchor or heavy jewellery is not allowed. ..FYI.< /text>

The experience is as the environment, Cold & Indifferent.
Everyone but Security and a man behind a floating podium and computer meet you behind thick glass and seldom if ever look into your face (let alone your eyes),
The experience is computer (inefficient), cold and computer'impersonal.
There is not a smile (for the needy public) to be returned or given freely here.
If you can somehow manage without the massive (NOT) $200.00 a month.
Do so, it will save your soul much grief and humiliation.
-One of the unfortunate needy.</Text>

<Review>The pizza (two slices) was fresh from the oven, steaming hot, huge, and delicious.  Building was tall but tiny, a drive through sort of place but after I ordered it, I had to park my car and the guy brought it out to my car, like a car hop.  He was so sweet and such a hard worker.  Don't forget to tip!</Review><GmapID>0x808f7977791eb92f:0x430ca6118836bbfc</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I just had a slice of the bbq chicken pizza. Really good. I like how they use a base pizza and build the one you want on top of it. So much cheesy goodness.<//text>

< review>
I ordered the chicken bacon pesto pizza and the cheeseburger fries.  The chicken bacon pizza is good.  However, the main issue is the cheeseburger fries.  I was expecting loaded fries covered bacon, cheese, and jalapeno; instead, I got an ACTUAL cheeseburger with plain fries.

Unless they read the order wrong, the cheese burger fries in the "loaded fries" section is incredibly misleading.<//review>

Restaurant quality food, with the convenience of a drive-thru.
This place is legit. The food is incredible.
Their pizza slices are huge, easily enough for two people, and it comes out freshly made and piping hot.
Fried Oreos. They have Fried Oreos!
On a whim, I tried the spaghetti bolognese and I was blown away by how good it was.
One of the reasons behind the quality of the food is the main guy working there.
He is more a chef than a mere employee.
He is very friendly, he loves to cook, and takes pride in the food he prepares.

So drive on through Speedy's, and experience the kind of food only a family owned restaurant can offer.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Small spot with pretty good pizza.  They have a drive thru but the speaker system didn't work so you just had to drive to the window and talk to the person there. Slices of pizza are huge and a great vale compared to the full pizza price.  Wings are very crispy and the shake wasn't bad.  The one thing that was lacking was friendly service.  The person who was running it the day I went seemed to not be in a very friendly or good mood and was just going through the motions.</Text><Rate>3< /Rate><Gmap_id>0x808f7977791eb92f:0x430ca6118836bbfc<//Gmap_id>< UserId.>

Great place to grab a bite to eat. Although one employee seems to always say he doesnt accept card whenever he is there but on other occasions others take my payment without hassel. Good food and good service some of the time.< /Text>

Real tasty pizza, cheap and fast. They've got all sorts of options like pizza, wings, pasta, and burgers. Their pasta is alright, but the pizza and wings are real winners.

If you decide to pick up, swinging around the drive thru is super simple. There's usually a parking spot if you arrive early. Most of the spots are usually taken up.</Text>

Ordering from this restaurant has been a very frustrating experience. It’s been over 1 1/2 hours since I placed my order and it still has not arrived. I’ve called 3 times to inquire and the the manager told me it’s on its way every time.
About 2 hours after I ordered, the food arrived cold and bland, with no apologies, just an attitude from the manager. DEFINITELY AVOID THIS PLACE!<//Review>

If you're looking for fast this probably isn't your place.  They don't make until you order it.  However if you're looking for some Italian food, it's the best in the area.</Text>

Great pizza, plenty of toppings, $9.99 to pick up cheese pie.  I paid more, I wanted three toppings.  Lots of hours.  Puts chain pizza to shame.  I should deduct because there are not any gluten free options, which means I won't be buying much here, unless I'm being stupid. Celiacs should not eat here. For those who can enjoy, I see why it's rated so high.  Heh and drive through pizza, fun.< /review>

<review>Really, quite honestly one of the worst pizzerias. Ordered a pepperoni and olives XL, and it came in a very timely manner. This was the first time we've ordered from here as we decided we wanted a change from Toto's. Pizza tastes like cardboard. Sauce has no flavor, and bread is awfully stale and oddly textured. Seriously save your taste buds the displeasure.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

I would say the best NY style pizza in Bay Area. People from the burbs may feel a little uneasy in this neighborhood at night. Well worth the trip out here.

Make sure use a little garlic powder on your slice.</Text>

<Time>1355715591525<//Time><review>Didn't have a chance to try the pizza.  Tried to order for delivery and the brochure that we picked up at the hotel had a $12 minimum for delivery.  Our order total was $14 and Maria informed me that their minimum was now $15 for delivery and that I had to order more in order to get delivery.  I told her that the brochure said $12 and she said it doesn't matter and the minimum is now $15.  She asked if I wanted to cancel the order then she hung up on me.  Very poor customer service.

Had pizza from DiNapoli and loved it.< /review><Rate>2</Rate></record>

< Review>
Placed an order for a pepperoni pizza and garlic bread, it took almost 2 hours to deliver. Guy told me they were 10 minutes away.. sure... garlic bread reminded me of left out Texas toast bought from the store. I ended throwing it away. Pizza, on the other hand, was for my son who is 9. He said it was ok.</Review>

These guys stated 45 minute delivery and took 1:45 minutes to even call us back. Said they showed up but didn't even knock. Never got our pizza and wouldn't even comp our order when we called back. Worthless!< /text>

<text>I recommend the pasta with meat sauce and meat balls or any other pasta selection.

The drive through prices are less than when you order by phone (even for pickup) so always order in the drive though.< /text>< username>

<text>After 7 months of planning a BBHS reunion with a 60's Classic Rock Band at 572 Social Club 4 days before the dinner they failed to accommodate us.  Chad's Place was more than happy to move their Karaoke for another night and feed and water us!  The Management and CHRIS was very accommodating and professional.  We had 200 people dancing, eating and having the best time.  I cannot THANK Chad's enough.  What an experience since the majority of us grew up knowing and seeing Chad's Place and some left before they could even enter this establishment! Very nostalgic.  The food was very good and the service was great.  The ambience was excellent.. Thank you so much for a wonderful night!<//text>< user_id>

<Review>I went for the karaoke which was a lot of fun. The KJ is nice and has a great singing voice. The bartender was terrific. The food looked good although I only had a few french fries and sweet potato fries that my friend got which were good. It's a casual place and the pool is free! Had so much fun shooting pool while listening to great music.<//Review>< pictures>

<Rate>4<//Rate><review>Definition of a mom and pop bar. Dark, simple and gets the job done. We had a great time watching football on some nice screens, while also taking in some people watching. We had great service until the place got packed, after which we were on our own. The solid bar food to pair with our beers and this place appeared to be kid friendly. Given that this place is right off the main strip, it fills up fast during peak hours. Would go back in a pinch.</review><pics>None< /pics><gmapID>0x80c4b39624956755:0x9be3391db51636f0<//gmapID>< Time>

Nice place but bad service if you have a tan! was in Big Bear for weekend an wanted to watch the Patriots vs Colts. saw this place and decided to give a try. Walked in and sat at bar, made eye contact with the three bartenders working (2 older ladies and a man). 20 min later and still no greeting or acknowledgement. place was not busy at all. It took me waving my hands in the air to get someone to help us. Finally got our beers and ordered food which was another horrible experience. food was ok, wasn't expecting anything great.
This is definitely a local place with a touch of good ole southern ignorance, not expecting this in Big Bear California!

would not recommend this place to anyone, this place needs a wake up call and New Staff!< /Text>

< review>
For New Year's Day, my boyfriend and I took a drive up to Big Bear City.  We stopped in the little village and saw what we thought was a cool bar to relax and get some dinner and drinks.  We went inside and noticed it was extremely busy.  With it being New Year's, we had no issues with the bar being very busy PLUS if that many people were hanging out there, the bar must be good place to relax.

We proceeded to sit down front and center at the bar--we got very lucky with seating.  There were two busy bartenders that seemed to be tending to everyone's orders rather quickly... except ours.  We made eye contact with a female bartender at least half a dozen times and she did not acknowledge us.  Fast forward 25 minutes and we are still there with no one even acknolwedging us.  I tried numerous times to get someone's attention and they proceeded to ignore us--especially the female who saw us sitting there without even muttering a word.  When we finally got her attention, we ordered our drinks and two waters.  She got us our drinks that were very weak--which I wasn't too surprised as they weren't very expensive, but failed to get us our waters.  Needless to say, she wasn't friendly at all or apologetic for not acknowledging us.  We finished our drinks, took the tip money we would have given her and went somewhere else.  I do understand that they were busy, but they seemed to assist everyone else except for us.  Terrible service.< /review>

<Review>Just missed the young women when walked im on tuesday. Beer prices high, 3.75 for bud. Some long haired guy bartending. If he didnt hear what you said he guesses, customer asked for certian alcohol he responded i dont know we have a lot and looked for approx two seconds. Customer had problem with games eating their money. Has potential to bring a good crowd tho.</Review>< GmapID>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>I came here in the early morning for breakfast.

Took the special breakfast, which were 2 pancakes, 2 eggs, bacon and hashbrown. Even got some tacos on the side.

It was a truly delicious American breakfast which I did not really expect from a Mexican place.

Would come back here! Owner is also super friendly.</Review>< Pics>

I paid $15 for enchiladas and an orange juice. But I got nachos with some red sauce and no meat. A tiny portion of eggs and beans. Not cool. I went home to eat.</Text>

Since I saw good reviews I thought the place would be ligit... Do not eat here. It tastes like the majority of the food comes from a can. It was such a disturbing experience.  Nothing like Mexican food. My son Romeo was like what would Chef say about this place...< /text>

<Text>So far I have had the fish taco and I love it. The Pico de gallo is so fresh and tasty. The pupusas are excellent. I could drink the salsa that is served with chips. The chilaquilas (red) were great. Also the caldo de res. I loved the fresh made blood orange juice. The service is also excellent. Tell Javier I sent you!< /Text>< resp>

This place has not disappointed.  There's a meat and potatoes (fries) dish that I haven't seen at other places.  The sweet and sour, and orange chicken are meaty. The veggies are not overly cooked in any of the dishes.</Review>< pics>

Cheap. Tasty. Fast.
Ok, so you don't like ordering food sitting in a warmer to take home. I understand. But this place has yet to disappoint me on flavor. It's not the best Chinese food but it's very good. I recommend ordering from the menu board for the freshest options. If you like shrimp, I highly recommend Shrimp with Lobster Sauce- must eat with hot chili oil- YUM! Good day for soup? Order the War Won Ton that has a ton of fresh veggies, shrimp, chicken, won ton, and delicious hot broth. The House Fried Rice, which comes with shrimp, pork, and chicken, is pretty legit and you get a lot.<//Review>

Little restaurant in a strip mall. As authentic as you can get to real Chinese food. Great cheap prices. Excellent authentic tasting food. Can't emphasize how authentic it is. Although it is fast food. It's great Chinese food overall. Would recommend this place to friends and family.< /text>

Good food and huge portions make this my go to Chinese food spot. Their broccoli beef is one of the best I've had and their spicy orange chicken is amazing as well. You cant go wrong with anything honestly. And unlike Panda Express, they don't skimp on the portions.</Review>

Little Beijing is best Chinese food in El Sereno. They serve large portion, the food is always fresh and cheap. One night they almost closed, but they still made fresh food for me, very appreciate it. My favor Tangerine chicken is amazing!!!</Text>

I've been coming here for over 15 years! This place is awesome and they have huge portions for the price. I personally like the Orange chicken with their pepper chicken. The beef and broccoli is great.< /text>

<review>I was hyped to try this out reading the reviews.
My personal experience getting the combo, half fried rice and half lo mein with shrimp was underwhelming.
I got 3 pieces of shrimp with 1lb of slimy cabbage and brocolli. Not really an entree. The noodle and rice arent well flavored and seasoned. I would paid $3 for this. My gut was telling me to just take a loss and throw it away.< /review>< pics>

I like going here early in the morning when they first open, that way I know the food is fresh and hasn't been sitting around all day,  drawback to that is that their teriyaki chicken isn't ready that early in the morning...opening  time is ten-fifteen and not the listed ten o clock like it says on the flyer and window,  I got there early one morning and had to wait a half an hour till the place opened, the girl there explained why they open at that time but i forgot what she said...clean place and fresh tasting food and the only Chinese restaurant I'll eat at in El Sereno...<//review>

Jason is amazing! I was looking for an apartment and Jason set up a rental search right away. I had been spending at least an hour every day looking for places, going to the same sites just to see if anything new had popped up and with the search Jason set up, I would be notified as soon as a new property went on the market which saved me a ton of time. Aside from how helpful he was and how great his services are, Jason is just a really great guy. He's really friendly, never tries to push things on you that you don't need, and extremely knowledgable about all aspects of Real Estate. I can't recommend using his services enough!</Review>

Jason Kardos was helpful in dealing with a difficult estate sale.  His communication was prompt and complete.  I never felt like I was just “one of many” clients, but that my questions and concerns were important.   When we sell another property, we’ll definitely use Jason.< /text>

I messaged him and he didn’t reply 3 days later a messages again and he asked if he’s helped me with a certain property before I said no, and explained what I needed and he said he’s busy and to email him but he will contact me when he gets back, provided no email has not contacted me at all and then I message him again and no response it’s been a week.
He’s the only person that comes up with knowledge of pet boarding/ kennel property in San Diego so I don’t know where to go to talk to someone cause I have had a really hard time and getting 5 words from this guys is impossible.
What’s the point of post a whole article to gravitate my kind of business toward him and not help and barely say 5 words in a week?< /Text>< Pics>

<resp>{'time': 1621656640636, 'text': "Hi Kiley, I am sorry you are frustrated in finding a pet and boarding kennel. That is a more specialized property. Are you looking in San Diego County? I am glad I was helpful in providing you information. There are not a lot of those properties available all the time, however feel free to call or email me and we can discuss your goals and I can see if I can help you find one.

Please contact me when you have time and I would be happy to discuss.

< Review>
My interaction with Jason as an out-of-state investor gave me ample opportunity to estimate his capabilities in many aspects of the real estate industry. In October 2019, I reached out to Jason to sell an investment condominium unit in San Diego. I enjoyed his efficient communication, his knowledge in the business, and his ability to resolve any issues proactively during the process. I am also satisfied with the team of people in charge of the renovation, cleaning, staging, escrow, and other services in his network. As an out-of-state investor, I was able to give Jason my complete trust and allowed him to help me with the process locally from start to finish.

The time to sell was longer than I had anticipated for this transaction, mainly due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, I believe being able to close the deal amid all the things this year is still impressive and should be commended. Hence, without any reservation, I recommend Jason to any investors or homeowners who have interests in selling or buying real estate in the San Diego area.

I want to express my appreciation for his expertise and professionalism. I will look forward to closing more deals with Jason in the future.<//Review>

Testimonial:
Mr Jason Kardos is by far a most capable, helpful and experienced Real Estate expert. His most virtuous asset is his "attention to detail" that he displays whenever I have contact with him for my rentals and real estate property business functions. I recommend him to anyone looking for full service with positive attitude.

My. Helix caught my interest as a possible neighborhood in San Diego that I might enjoy. When there was a specific house I liked, I called the realtor
listed. That was Jason Kardos, realtor of Mt. Helix Lifestyles Real Estate. Jason was immediately like-able & seemed to be agreeable & professional. He never rushed me on house tours & gave me an entire tour of Mt. Helix.

I kept his business card and phoned him to see another two properties in Mt. Helix, one in Vista & eventually one near Rancho Bernardo.
He literally drove me around 2/3 of San Diego County. I am most grateful.

Mr. Kardos also was also consistent in sending me a daily listing of suitable rental properties. He was able in a short time to understand my preferences for housing style & was very successful in choosing homes that I liked.

The most helpful contact that Jason Kardos offered was a loan officer, Ian Wright of Bay Equity LLC of Del Mar CA, who successfully found lenders to match my complicated economic situation. That valuable contact eventually allowed me to qualify for a home loan in San Diego.

Jason Kardos  also helped me find a storage solution for a large collection of antique furniture & even introduced me to an antique dealer in La Mesa in case I needed to sell anything vintage or antique.
Jason Kardos is  trustworthy & understands the real estate business. He is careful & professional with paperwork that is so important. Additionally Jason seems very available on the phone & computer and is willing to go an extra mile to be very helpful. I do recommend this real estate professional and would not hesitate to work with him again.< /review>

I reached out to Jason with some zoning questions about a business opportunity I am looking into and he was both beyond helpful and instantaneously responsive! Based on this interaction alone, I wouldn't hesitate to use him for my future real estate needs. You'll be in good hands if you do the same!</Review>

<Review>Jason and his team did a fantastic job helping my family. As a former real estate agent, it was important that I find someone professional and fair to help my family sell some inherited land.  From the start, Jason was transparent and honest.  He took extra time to work with my family and often went out of his way to make sure they understood what was going on.  I highly recommend Jason and his company to anyone looking for help with their real estate needs!</Review>< pics>

As you know, land can be tough to sell sometimes depending on it price in relationship with the topography of the land, what type of zoning it has and improvements, such as utilities, grading, & building entitlements/plans. I really enjoyed sitting at the kitchen table with your parents discussing the sale since they did not have a computer or access to email. I know your Dad was so happy to get the most for the land so that your Mom could budget this unexpected money to pay off some bills and not have to worry about things on their tight budget. I am here for your guys if you need help with anything in the future. Warmly, Jason'}</resp>

<Text>This is the second time I have used Jason for a real estate transaction.  The first time was for the purchase of my home, the most recent was for the sale of my condo. Both times were extremely well managed and professional.  He had excellent ideas and referrals for the improvements and fixes I needed to make to add value to the condo.  He was very hands on with all the right touches to get it ready for sale. There were multiple offers and the condo sold above what I was expecting.  He explained each step of the process very well, and walked me through the paperwork to make sure I understood what I was signing.  Escrow started right before I was scheduled to be out of the country for 3 weeks.  He made sure everything I needed to do was taken care of before I left. Escrow went very smoothly.  We closed in under 30 days. Jason is a very professional and knowledgeable realtor, as well as kind  and generous person.  I would highly recommend him for all your real estate needs.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Rating>5</Rating>< GmapID>

So when it was time to purchase a home, I felt really comfortable in using Mt. Helix Lifestyles & Jason to represent me, and I'm glad I did. The process was fast paced and he was all over it from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. moving the documents along with the seller's agent and there were things he saw during the walk through that I looked right past. He lined up a super team for the home inspection which caught things that the seller had to fix, which saved me thousands on the purchase. I will definitely  refer Mr. Kardos to my Friends & Family.< /review>< pictures>

The services Jason Kardos supplies are simply top notch!  His dedication to making sure that you are his number one client is very much apparent and appreciated. Jason always makes sure to stay on top of all the paperwork throughout the process.  Jason does an excellent job in spending all the quality time with you that is needed to keep you well informed and comfortable with everything that needs signing during the escrow process.  His knowledge and experience in real estate will help you buy/sell your home in the fastest time possible.  I'm super happy that I trusted the sale of my last home to Jason and I will definitely be using his services again the next time I need a real estate agent!<//Review>

I picked Jason as my Broker for the sale of my personal residence after knowing and working with him professionally for more than five years.

2020 presented unique marketing problems which Jason was able to address effectively and with the professional expertise I have grown to expect.  Jason was able to advise me as to important marketing alternatives as well as work with the selling agent to assure that the challenges presented the Buyers by COVID 19 were addressed.

I have no hesitation is recommending Jason to sell your home!  If you are a Buyer, Jason will use the same skill set to make sure you are happy with your purchase.

Jason is fantastic. As a first time home buyer, I had an endless amount of questions and concerns. With Jason's knowledge of the real estate transaction process as well as his network of industry professionals, I was able to close with confidence. He referred me to financial services, provided expert recommendations regarding market trends and valuations, and took the time to answer every email and phone call. Jason is not a pushy sales type; he is more concerned with finding you a quality home that fits your budget than with closing a deal. Great service, great knowledge, great team. When you're ready to start the buying process, call Jason.<//text>

Jason helped us in the process of buying a new home. He was very helpful, detailed oriented and accommodated all of our requests. He also helped us with our rental which involved screening of potential tenants, running background checks and credit history.  It was a pleasure working with him.

Jason Kardos is honestly one of the best Realtors around. I've always been impressed with his wide array of knowledge within every aspect of Real Estate and the local market. Many agents just push the sale of the home, but Jason is actually very skilled and knows the ins & outs of everything related to Real Estate. Whether you're buying, selling, flipping, doing renovations, residential or commercial, need advice on do-it- yourself projects or maintenance, or simply need a referral for anything property related, he's a great resource. To give you an example, he actually offered to help cut down a tree at my house which was such a stress reliever for me, yet no big deal to him. He's also just a very nice guy and fun to talk with, while really knowing his stuff at the same time. I really trust his opinion because he's so actively involved in the business day to day (which isn't the case for all realtors). For these reasons, I referred a couple of my friends to him to help them buy their first home. They were cautious buyers, but they quickly realized how genuine, honest and resourceful he was as they navigated their first home purchase. Jason and I encouraged them to get not only Pre-Approved but have their file Underwritten before finding a property which helped them win the deal in a very competitive market. Highly recommend Jason if you're looking for a great real estate resource. Thanks for what you do Jason!<//text>

Where to begin...Let me start off by saying that Jason will never disappoint you.  He will go out of his way to do whatever it takes to get your house sold for the most amount of money in the shortest time possible.  He sold my parents' home for me but he not only sold the home, he was over there one day while I was working  and he started cutting back bushes, moving stuff around and throwing junk in the trash.  How many realtors do you know that would do that?  I have so much more I could tell you but not sure how much room I have for everything so just let me say, with all my heart, if you want the best realtor...call Jason...P.S.  and he really likes the baconator from Wendy's...:)<//review>

I know many people suggested that you sell the home "as-is" and not do anything to the home, however you wanted to honor your parents and had a vision of how to improve it and make it better for the next owner. I do enjoy helping clients prepare their home before listing it on the MLS and there are many things you can do that don\'t necessarily cost a lot of money like cleaning up the yard, cutting back vegetation, cleaning inside and out and painting and replacing simple things like screens, light bulbs, door handles, etc. Your home also had a cell phone tower on it that added an extra consideration in marketing and making sure the new owner was informed of easements and what type of terms conveyed with the sale. Finally I did have fun helping you stage the home with items you had and my personal staging items that I provide for free as part of my marketing plan. PS: Yes, thank you for the lunch when we were having one of our work parties at the home! :)'}</Response>

His advertising and pictures were very professional and the house sold quickly.  When the buyers agent wasn't taking care of his end Jason worked extra hard to make sure thing were on schedule.

We are still experiencing very low inventory for the number of buyers that want to buy a home and it is not unheard of to have as many as 10 of more multiple offers on a property. The positive is that interest rates are very low and had dipped under 3% interest depending on a buyer's credit score, amount of down payment etc. I checked my database and did not find your contacts, however feel free to message me directly and we can go over where you are at currently with loan approval. Many buyer's do not realize that they can use gift funds from a friend or family member if they do not quite have enough funds for a down-payment. If you were in the military and can qualify for a Veterans Administration loan (VA), there are 100% financing programs.  The two main other loan products would be the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loan program where a buyer can qualify with putting 3.5% down of the purchase price. Then there are conventional loans which people think they have to have 20% down the purchase price although there are conventional loans that that a buyer can put down 3-5% of the purchase price. These loans have a Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI) fee on them because of the low amount of down payment to protect the lender in-case a borrower defaults on their loan. The good thing to know is this PMI can drop off a loan once the property has an acceptable amount of equity for the lender. I hope this helps explain some basic loan programs that are out there. It would be best to talk to a lender about what what loan programs would be best for you. I look forward to hearing from you so that we can discuss more when you have time. Warmly, Jason"}< /Response>< name>

I could not have imagined a smoother process. Jason went above and beyond eliminating any obstacle and making an overwhelming situation, simple and straightforward. The team was knowledgeable about the process, laws and regulations. I'm so happy I moved forward with this decision and with trusting Mt Helix.</Review>

I am glad I could help you through the process with giving notice to your tenants to vacate, assessing pre-marketing items to do such as carbon dioxide, smoke detectors, termite inspection and a strapped water heater. It was fun helping you finalize the trash out and change locks. We did a lot of work and it helped obtain "Top Dollar" for the sale of your home with accessory dwelling garage conversion. It is always gratifying to help a home owner with their real estate goals. All the best, Jason'}<//Resp></record>

Jason Kardos did a magnificent job of marketing and selling a vacant residential lot.  Although a small transaction compared to the sale of a residence, he treated it as though it were a large transaction.  His efforts resulted in a sale that went very smoothly.  Having been a real estate agent in the past, I know how difficult these transactions can be and am impressed by how well this one was done.  Jason kept me fully informed about everything and made sure that all deadlines were met once the transaction went into escrow.  His performance exceeded my expectations and I am pleased that I selected him to be my agent.</text>

Jason is VERY thoughtful and helpful throughout the process!  He never appeared focused on anything but assisting me in selling a rental property at the best price.  He was also very communicative through email, text, and phone calls, so I always knew the work he was doing to sell the property.</text>

I just closed on a great house that Jason found for me!  I couldn't be happier!  Jason helped me through the whole process, taking care of everything.  He is so knowledgeable and always stays on top of everything, making the buying process stress free and easy!  This is my third time using Jason.  He also sold my home last year and dealt with the not so responsive buyer and their agent.  He stayed on top of them and made sure the sale stayed on track and closed.  He truly cares for his clients and goes above and beyond to make sure they are satisfied and happy.  He always responded to my calls and emails right away and was always ready to go tour a house the day I asked.  I highly recommend using Jason as your agent.  You will not be disappointed!< /Text>

We contacted Jason for assistance in getting a valuation of our home after an extensive renovation. He was so prompt in replying! And not just in replying; understanding that we had a deadline, he completed the estimate and delivered a written report within 24 hours! It was obvious that he had firsthand knowledge of the neighborhood and surrounding area. It really was a pleasure to work with Jason.<//text>

If you are looking for a realtor who will sell your home with complete expertise--look no further than Jason Kardos, Broker,  Mr. Helix Lifestyles.  From a referral I received from a friend who had nothing but great things to say about Jason, I chose Jason to sell my mom's house in San Diego.  From the moment I met him to our final handshake once the house was sold--in record time!!!!!--I was very pleased with the entire transaction!  Selling my mom's house--the place my brothers and I had grown up--was a very emotional experience for the three of us.   We felt very lucky to have a realtor with Jason's experience at the helm.  Selling a home is a very complicated experience.  There are many papers to fill out, many things to think about, and dozens of other details that go into the sale.  Thankfully, by using Jason as our real estate agent, the entire experience went beyond easy.  My brothers and I were very grateful for everything that Jason did to make the selling of our mother's home as easy as it could possibly be.  If you are looking for a terrific realtor--Jason Kardos fits this description perfectly.<//Review>

<Review>The prepcast in my opinion is the best money can buy. Aside providing me a better understanding of the requirement and hurdles to passing the exams, the various interview episodes clearly spaced out  within the various modules was just classy. This provided a greater insight to Agile methods and practices from a practitioner's point of view and deeper appreciation of the various concepts.

On encountering difficult questions during the exams those voices already engraved in my memory came in handy already after several passes my during . So those interviews with the experts do help a great deal. Trust me!

The whole package was well thought out and deployed.

Good luck as you prepare.<//Review>< pics>

I signed up for the original PM Prepcast prior to the pandemic and found the lessons to be very easy to follow and understand. The lessons followed the PMBOK and had many additional topics related to project management outside the PMBOK, but important for the PMI test.

Fast forward through the darkest part of the pandemic to the end of 2020...

I did not have a chance to continue my studies for almost a year, and decided to sign up for the new instructor-led class. For me, that was the way to go! It was broken up into logical segments and the ongoing group work discussions and question review made many of the new concepts easy to follow along. The instructor was very knowledgeable and having someone be able to answer questions was great.

After studying for an additional few months, I passed my PMP with flying colors.</text>

EMMANUEL OLASEHINWA (MBA, CBAP, PMI-ACP)

Fail fast and discover success early! This is my story with PMI-ACP certification. I am a certified Business Analyst working with a Tech company in Ottawa, CA supporting Agile change transition.

After failing in my 1st attempt , l discovered Cornelius Fichtner's ACP podcast and simulation materials. The explanations on Agile domain were real and practical for me to understand.  At first, the simulations questions appeared too tough for me however, given that the simulation tool is design to explains why each answer options is right or wrong really help my understanding and confidence building to re-take the exam. I combined this materials with Mike Griffith's PMI-ACP exam prep, navigate the ACP blogs to be aware of other students experiences and all of this strategies help me build confidence. l became PMI-ACP certified mid 2019.

I therefore recommend these resources as a sure path for PMI-ACP success. Thanks to OSP International.<//review>

It is the best simulator in the world! The simulator explains in a detailed and professional way which is the correct answer, why, and why the others are wrong.  OMG, I had never seen a simulator that had that.  It is evident that behind this simulator there are a series of experienced professionals in the project area.  I recommend it 200%. The price-quality ratio is unbeatable<//Text>

Have purchased their Exam Simulator and I am sure it is in good quality and also with clear explanation in every questions / answers!  (as sometimes you want to know why my answer is not correct rather than which one is the best answer!)

My friend who didn't purchase the exam simulator here, always share the free questions that is lack of the explanation and seems not a correct answer!

It helped with my exam preparing and I passed with 4AP result. :)

You should paid for it, it worth!</review>

<text>What can I say about the “The PM PrepCast”  tool...
First, realistic test questions presented in short 20 minute tests to full 4 hour tests
Second, the way the tool can be used to help you focus on the areas you find you are weak in
Third, historical data of your results so you can measure your improvements as you take additional tests

Using the tool allowed me to see my strengths and weak points.
Create focused testing on the weak points and measure my improvements.
Most of all it gave me a sense of comfort in my ability to answer the question in the allotted test time.

On the day of the audited test, I actually felt I was in good shape during the test!
My pace of testing tracked almost to the minute with the PM PrepCast prep testing I hand done.

Best of all I passed on the first try with “Above Target” in 4 of the 5 domains and overall well into “Above Target” Proficient range for the entire test.

You cannot go wrong with the  “The PM PrepCast” .< /text><Name>Mike Sam< /Name><Gmap_id>0x80dcdaea30496c3b:0x6197bf09e1400df8</Gmap_id><Pics>None< /Pics>< UserId.>

<text>This PrepCast was crucial to me passing the PMP exam this week. It's affordable, and the instructor, Cornelius Fitchner, was a hoot. He was so passionate about PM material, and made a bunch of nerdy jokes (which I deeply appreciated). I can't praise it enough. I seriously wouldn't have passed without this tool. Highly highly recommend. Makes the exam seem easy!<//text>< pictures>

The course was really great, especially the test simulator which is definitely a must.  I listened to each presentation at least once, and a few of them several times.  It was easy because I could download them to my phone and listen to them while walking my dog, driving back and forth to work, or just hanging out at home.  I took 6 or 7 of the 4 hour exam simulator tests, which really prepared me for the real exam, and I passed on the first attempt with above target in all categories.</Text>

I am totally satisfied with this exam simulator. You will get the value for money you paid. Therefore, I recommend you not to hesitate to buy it if you can afford. The quality and quantity of the simulator questions are really good (harder than PMP exam in my opinion). Moreover, the explanation of both correct and wrong answer choices enables you to understand your mistakes. Ultimately, you will be equipped with the necessary knowledge and techniques for PMP exam.< /Review>

<Review>The PMP PrepCast is a very useful tool while getting ready for PMP exam. Moreover,  It's good to have the simulator handy to for getting acquainted with the real exam questions and cases.  My confidence increases ( or sometimes decreases) when I use it checking the knowledge gained from the book. The latter is definitely not enough for PMP exam preparation. Hope my feedback will be useful. I'll share more insights after my real exam.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< rating>

<review>The Exam Simulator was really helpful. I took all the 4 exam on a strict exam condition spelt out by PMI. I took the first 2 test 5 days to the main exam and reviewed all the questions I got wrong. Then 2 days to exam, I took remaining test & reviewed the wrong answers. My average for all all the 4 test was low (59.8) but I knew after reviewing all the wrong answers , I could do better in the main exam. And I passed with above target score. I used different materials to prepare before purchasing the Simulator exam.</review><rate>5< /rate>< gmap_id>

The PM exam simulator 2021 is a Must Have to pass the new exam. Take the mock exams and study each right and wrong answer. This helped me pass the exam! They explain all the right and wrong answers and provide references. They have a forum where you can ask questions and their staff is answering questions. They give podcasts with up to date info on lessons learned on the new exam. This truly the best simulator out there along with their other products.</Review>

I wanted to wait for the exam to provide a feedback, however it would not be honest not to say now that, indipendntly on the real exam results, that you did a great job. I used other simulators, even higher in the cost, but nothing to do with this one. It is accurate in the explanations, it seems to be update according to the last exam mode. By the way how the simulator is structured, it is clear the passion you dedicated to develop this product. You did a wonderful job. The next will be my last call before the next change towards the 7th edition, but in case I would need to get another simulator in the future, for sure it will be yours. Thanks< /review>

<review>The Project Management Precast PMP Exam Simulator is well worth the money. I loved all the daily learning emails with quizzes included that helped reinforce my training. The Lessons Learned webinar was invaluable (free on YouTube) as well because it showed me what to focus on studying for the 2021 exam. More importantly, the quiz and exam questions really helped prepare me for the exam better than any other training material I used over the past 9 months. Thank you for helping me pass my test! I now have earned my PMP!

The prepcast simulator questions were really helpful in preparing for the exam. After all the studies you have done, you need to get tested in your concepts before the exam. Prepcast simulator offers very high quality questions with answers and detailed explanations. I passed my PMP exam just because I could prepare myself with "real exam like scenario of sitting 4 hours at one place for Prepcast mock exams".<//review>

< Review>
If you are considering getting your PMP, need hours to qualify, or just need continued education hours then this is the product for you. As a self-taught PM with 5 years experience, I was nervous about sitting for the PMP exam.
It wasn't until I signed up for the PrepCast that I realized how unprepared I was for the exam. But, after 2 months spent prepping with the PrepCast, I PASSED the exam FIRST TRY with everything Above Target.
The practice tests were invaluable. I took 8 of the practice test, reviewed all of my missed questions, created flash cards from them, and kept reviewing and reviewing until it stuck. If nothing else, taking 8 full practice test prepared me to sit for the actual exam and manage my time properly.

I can't speak highly enough for the program, and I know I am a better PM after taking the course. It is always good to have another tool in the toolbox.</Review>

I really liked PM Prepcast and their knowledge into PMP Material. Their question bank is very thorough. Their answers tell you why you are wrong and why right choice is truly the right choice. Securing 70-75% in prepcast is considered you are almost ready for exam in a week. Highly recommended.</Review>

<review>PM prepcast new syllabus mock pattern of questions were more valued and benefited personally during my pmp preparations, as u have not got these kinds of real exams-like questions in any other vendors. Moreover prepcast are U.S  based and qualitative.

THE U.I of website are also similar to real- exam. Eg: the timer countdown..

I registered for the PMP prepcast premium package in 2020, but because it was closer to the end of the year I was mentally prepared to take the exam under the new ECO. I found prepcast very honest about the value and training that they offered with this transition. I ended up taking their booster course as well. Here’s what I liked about prepcast:
1)	The self-paced training highlights key information from the PMBok and gives you additional resources not covered in the guides that are relevant
2)	The exam simulator is very good at disciplining your mind for a 4 hour exam and training you to focus on reading ambiguous questions and choosing from a set of answers that all look very good.
3)	The live feedback on the exam simulator was very useful in providing me with clarifications from experts when I needed them, and very promptly.
4)	The detailed answers on the exam reviews were also really good at helping me learn from the right as well as the wrong answers. I learned a lot from these and how to look for hints to answer the questions.

Here’s what I think needs improvement:
1)	The prepcast exam simulator questions do not resemble the exam. The actual exam is far more ambiguous. I realize the 2021 ECO was just rolled out, but I would recommend tuning the exam questions accordingly. Having said this, using a strong exam simulator is key in learning how to respond to questions even if the questions don’t resemble the actual exam. The simulator is still very good at training you to decipher questions.< /text>

I planned to give my exam on 31 December 2020 because the syllabus and the exam pattern were about to change after that day. I finished my practice Rita Mulchay's PMP Exam Prep Ninth Edition by the end of the third week of December 2020. I contacted my instructor, Mr Junaid, from the PMI Lahore chapter, and I asked him what I could do to increase my success chances in the PMP Exam. He recommended that if I am willing to spend a little bit of money, the Prepcast simulator for PMP is the way to go. The advantages of this simulator are given below:
1. You can use the simulator in a wide variety of ways. You can have small, focused quizzes (based on knowledge groups, process groups, not answered before, etc.) or have a complete full-fledged exam simulation. Using this, you can target the specific areas where your concepts are weak.
2. Another nice thing about the simulator is that in each question, you can understand four new concepts in a sense. The correct answer is given with its explanation, and the three wrong choices are explained too. The explanation of why wrong and why correct leads you to understand four different PMI concepts comprehensively with each question.
3. The scenario-based questions are either of the same difficulty or a higher difficulty level than the actual exam. This makes you exam ready.
After just using this simulator for just a little more than a week, I succeeded in the PMP Exam, securing the above target in all process groups.</review>

I can't recommend this product highly enough.  I passed my PMP exam over the weekend (first try) and this tool was basically the only one I used for the last 3-4 weeks of my exam prep.

Things I found most useful about the product:

-You can do as few or as many questions as you like - if you only have 20 minutes before dinner, you can do 10 questions!  If you want it to be longer, you can do up to 100.

-You can tailor your practice exams to the areas where you're weaker (and this is easy to do since each practice exam shows your results breakdown in detail).

-The answers are reviewed in great detail - not only the correct answer but why the others are incorrect.  This is really important for the PMP!!!  Trying to memorize everything won't work, you have to really internalize the concepts.  Practicing the exam questions is the ONLY way to properly prepare for this kind of exam, in my opinion.

-Five full-length exams is the PERFECT amount for practicing.  For me, this worked very well - I did one apiece on Saturday and Sunday in the weekends leading up to my test.  On the weekdays in between, I did shorter practice tests focusing on my weaker areas.  I saved the last full length one for the weekend before my test.

I also have to applaud the responsiveness of their support staff.  At one point I had a question about one of the exams and I got a response within an hour, tops.  I went back and forth with the person several times to clarify something and she was extremely polite, quick, and direct with her responses.

Lastly - I love that they offer free exams to give the flavor of how it works.  If you're on the fence about purchasing the membership, go ahead and do the free trial so you can get an idea of what it offers (and then purchase it - you won't regret it).  I could not have passed my exam without this amazing practice tool, it was worth every penny.< /Text>

Hands down the best prep tool I used for the PMP certification. I took the current test (2020) before it changes and was a first time go thanks to PrepCast. The questions are challenging and the program does a great job at explaining why answers are correct and why wrong answers aren't quite right. Customer service and support are quick and expedient and the interface is nearly identical to the testing interface. An amazing tool!</text>

YOU NEED THIS! This was best money spent.  I don't care how much you study, if you don't practice exam questions, it will be hard for you to apply your knowledge.  This simulator is almost identical to the real exam environment.  The length and content of the questions are almost identical as well.  I went into the exam as if I've done it multiple times and passed!< /Review>

I purchased the PM Prepcast simulator for my PMP preparation and it was worth the money. The questions are carefully crafted and test good conceptual understanding of the content tested on the exam. One of the best things about the simulator is the way in which DETAILED explanations are provied for every question. Going through those explanations really helps in knowing about the RIGHT reasons of accepting or rejecting a particular answer choice. In my opinion, the questions on the exam are somewhat easier than the ones found in the simulatior, which again, is a good thing to have :). I recommend this product to everyone preparing for the PMP exam.< /review>

I recommend this PrepCast. I am 100% satisfied.
My experience in a nutshell.  I have completed other PMP courses, I read PMP books etc.. Not withstanding my knowledge and experience, I needed to build some level of confidence before taking my exam. I took two prep Exams on the Project Management PreCast site. I failed both of them because I didn't have the time to answer all the questions. For each prep exam, I spend about an hour. But review all the questions in details. Please refrain from memorizing the questions, it will not help you. Rather understanding all the performance domains which are process , the business process and the people and then practicing the exams is the trick.
PMP Certified on first attempts with an average score of PASS: Above target.</text>

I used the PMP Exam Simulator 2021 as a study and practice guide to pass the Project Management Institute's Project Management Professional (PMP) certification exam, in conjunction with the PMBOK guide.  In 21 hours of online study, quizzes and practice exams I answered 56% of the simulator's available 2,150 questions.  I did about 50 separate quizzes of 10 to 60 questions each and 3 full blown (180 questions and about 3 hours each) practice exams, of which I passed two and failed one.  This studying and practice translated into an "above target" grade on the actual PMI on-line PMP certification exam.  That exam also consisted of 180 questions, that I took 3 of the available 4 hours to complete. I credit the PMP Exam Simulator 2021 with providing good studying information and practice structure that directly led to my good exam performance.</text>

Project Management PrepCast was absolutely valuable for my PMP exam preparation. Couldn't have asked for better practice than what I got with the simulator.  I took 5 full length exams in the last 2 weeks leading upto the exam and I was completely tuned into the exam mindset. Explanations for both correct and incorrect answers helped me understand the best approach to identify the best answer when I thought two answers were very close.  The videos were very valuable too. I know I'll be referring back to them and use them to reflect on important project management concepts even after my exam. Thank you Cornelius for the wealth of knowledge you've shared!</Text>

<Text>I highly recommend PM Prepcast by Cornelius Fichtner. The content and the questions deepens the understanding of almost all the PMP concepts. I thoroughly did all 2100 questions including the mock tests and I scored Above Target in all domains on my first try. The Learning Quiz and timed quizzes are very helpful. The questions on real exam were bit tougher than the simulator but I could easily sail through only because I had a habit of solving the Prepcast questions so the methodology was acquired. Do not leave even a single explanation about the answers of the questions because every explanation is full of precious information that might be useful to know. For understanding the concepts, Prepcast does a great job.
Wish you all luck for your exams!</Text><pics>None</pics><response>{'time': 1618238675872, 'text': 'Thank you for recommending out PrepCast Exam Simulator and writing a great review. Congratulations on passing your exam!'}< /response>< gmap_id>

I took Agile Prepcast for PMI-ACP.. The mock questions were of utmost quality with detailed explanations for each of the correct and incorrect options.
I found it very useful to clear my PMI-ACP Exam. A big thumbs up to the entire team for creating high quality questions. Highly recommended for PMI-ACP Exam.

I am also PMP certified. While preparing for my exams many recommended to take Prepcast for PMP mocks too !!!< /text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>First off, a huge shout out to Cornelius Fichtner. PM Prepcast is a genius staff to crack PMP.

I have seen lot of reviews saying that PM Prepcast questions are the most close to actual exam. Well, I am not going to comment on that but what I can say that solving PM Prepcast questions and reviewing all the answers (both correct and incorrect ones) gave me real confidence to take the real exam.

It was only after taking PM Prepcast exams I felt like I was ready for the real exam. I have scored consistently between 82% to 86% in all the seven full length Prepcast exams and more than 90% in few timed quizzes.

I have passed the PMP exam few weeks ago with 4AT 1T and I am really proud of my achievement.

Finally, my advise to all the PMP aspirants would be that most of the questions, if not 100%, are situational. Hence, understanding the underlying concepts of PMBOK guide and getting clarity of thoughts are key to pass the exam. The time required to achieve that may vary person to person. Hence, planning (in terms of time required for studying the concepts, completing few mock tests and finally scheduling the exam) is very important as the case with exam questions too.

Following three things are very important
1. Over preparation
2. Under preparation
3. Unwanted time gap between the time when you feel you are ready to take the exam and the date of real exam.

I am willing to help PMP aspirants with my limited knowledge (iamniladri@gmail.com).

Happy learning!<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

<rating>4<//rating><text>This course along with the PMP Simulator lead to me passing my PMP exam with "Above Target" in all 3 areas. I didn't purchase the RITA nor did I purchase the Agile book published by PMI. It was literally the normal PMBOK, the course, and the Exam simulator that got me through. The simulator really prepared me for the real exam.

I took away a star because I purchased the course before the exam switched and there wasn't enough "required" (it is available as supplemental, and optional) course material on hybrid/agile projects which is a must have (though if you purchase the exam simulator you will have access to plenty of practice questions on this).

I also took away a star because some of the new exam simulator questions were a little less complex in the sense that I had to answer almost a flashcard type of answer, rather than show that I understood the concept . For frame of reference, I had access to the Exam simulator for the old version of the PMP Exam, and noticed that there were a lot more concept questions, leading me to expect that as the content creators get more accustomed to the new format, the questions will become a bit more complex.

Overall, I can't complain though, because I did also pass with flying colors :). I would highly recommend this product to any and all who are interested in taking the PMP exam.< /text>< Pics>

So I literally passed the pmp exam in one attempt WITHOUT consulting the PMBOK guide but just only using lessons learned from the PMPrep cast exam simulator.
The questions are realistic but most valuable is the questions reviews and feedback.
Best exam prep I have come across in recent times.
Thanks team.</Review>

I am now a proud PMP! Gave the 2021 exam and passed on the first attempt Above Target (2) and Target (1).

PM prepcast is an absolute MUST. I never got the chance to do the simulation exams but I was able to attempt 50-100 quiz questions for each knowledge area. The explanations against every choice provided are super and really help clear a lot of concepts and gaps in your knowledge.

In the actual exam, one doesn't have the time to think much - the answers should come to you instinctively and that happens when you have practiced enough.

There is absolutely no need to memorize the process chart and there is certainly no need to memorize the ITTOs. Just understand and think like a PM. Common sense, past PM experience and practice are your best tools to pass the exam. AND 30-40 days are more than enough to prep. That being said, do remember that the exam is NOT easy. It's tiring and will test your nerves.< /review>

PMP Prepcast exam simulator is one of the main reasons why I was able to pass the PMP certification in one attempt. The simulated exams are pretty difficult but that's the whole idea of going through these at least couple of times to ensure you're fully ready. The quality of the questions and responses is extremely good. I didn't sit for the exam until I was scoring above 80%.
Because of COVID I had to reschedule my testing date and the Prepcast team was so kind to give me an extension for free of cost. That allowed me to continue testing my knowledge until couple of days before I was scheduled to sit . Thanks a ton!!<//review>

<rate>5< /rate><text>These questions are good but real exam questions are more confusing than what is in the simulator. So if you are taking the simulator questions, Make sure you do all tests and spend enough time to review all doubts as making sure why 3 options were not as good answer as the correct one. Sometimes there would be hairline difference in options given on real exam, so If you do not have clear understanding of the concept, you might choose wrong answer.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<Text>I honestly cannot express my gratitude enough for PMP PrepCast. After exploring several different tools to study for my credential, I can attest this was a total treasure to come across! They have created a robust tool that is clearly methodically maintained, and diligently vetted with the end user in mind. I was able to thoroughly test my knowledge through easily customizable quizzes, take practice exams, and have a humanized way to understand content across the board. Their reporting metrics were exceptional, and hands down I would absolutely encourage anyone serious about pursuing a credential to explore this solution.<//Text>< name>

Absolute best PMP exam prep around! The exam simulator helped form the learning material into question format, and truly filled in the learning gaps I needed. Don't look anywhere else. Highly recommend! Passed last week with several ATs! Huge thanks to Cornelius and the PM PrepCast team!<//review>

I passed my PMP exam today and want to thank the PM prepcast for the outstanding mock exams, they really helped in the preparation of the exam.  Spend the time and the money on the exams it is well worth it!  Use the filters to go through low scoring areas and review all of the notes for each answer.  I went back through and took practice test by choosing random on all of the questions I got wrong to shore up my understanding, great feature that they include.   Best of luck to all!<//review>

<rating>5</rating><Review>PM PrepCast was the key to my success!!!!  I just took the PMP Exam and passed on my 1st try.  What really helped me the most was the Exam Simulator. The videos helped me retain information too.  I felt so comfortable taking my test online because I had used the simulator to practice both timed and learning tests. Although recommended, I never completed a "full" 200 question exam before exam day.  Instead, I took multiple 30 - 50 question timed quizzes by knowledge area. HIGHLY recommend PM PrepCast if you plan to take the PMP exam :)< /Review>< Pics>

I took all the mock tests and learning quizzes which really helped me to be fully prepared for my actual PMP exam. I highly recommend PMP Exam Simulator to all the PMP aspirants. Good Luck !!!

<text>Yesterday I cleared my Pmp exam, it was my first trial, I read the pmbok guide 2 times, I did some free tests and Cornelius test was one of them, which I chose straight away since it is by far much more detailed and logically structured than the other exams. I purchased then Elite plus 2 months ago. This product worth much more than the money value of its purchase.it is done perfectly and you feel that Cornelius is trying more than his best to make you assimilate this material, especially the detailed explanation for each of the four answers of each of the 1800 questions as well as the illustration of precast videos. In summary, it is and an elegant excellently done job.
Finally, I would like to thanks Cornelius for helping me to pass my exam from my first trial through his Elite plus.<//text>< pictures>

<Review>Worth every penny! I'm glad I found this course.
It assisted me every step of the way to get PMP certificate; from how to apply for the exam to what to do on the exam date. And I passed the exam on the first attempt =).

I purchased PM PrepCast premium which included exam simulator. I had two months to study because it was already Oct 2020, and I didn't want to deal with the new 2021 exam. The course was so flexible and I could adjust it to fit my own schedule. I skimmed through all VDOs once before actually applied for the exam because I wanted to fill out project management experiences section with PMI terminology and concept following PMBOK guide; was hoping that it could help me avoid application audit. I was told that the audit was random, but still I just wanted to avoid it everyway I could. After my exam application was confirmed, I went through all VDOs again together with PMBOK guide, took notes, memorized process group and knowledge area mapping, and then hit the simulator. Since I didn't have much time I only did 4-hr exam simulator twice, and several 20-question quizzes.

I think both the course and simulator are really useful, especially if you have a tight preparation period. The course helped me to understand underlying concept of PMBOK guide in a short time, and the simulator helped me to get the sense of how the question would be asked in the exam and also time management. Thank you Cornelius and team for such a helpful product.< /Review>< Time>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>I passed the PMP last Friday evening after 6 long months and having failed the old version of the test the first time. It was not an easy journey but I will say the greatest difference in all of my studying which utilized Rita Mulcahy 9th edition and PMtraining site to initially get the 35 credit hours was the full length simulations of the exam via prepcast. In addition with the new exam having the new drag and drop, plus the select multiple correct answers, prepcast was the only site that gave that scenario. I have horror stories of my journey to passing such as completing 120 questions and Pearson Vue crashing out and needing to take the test completely over again. PMI and Pearson Vue did get this correct though and I was not charged for the mistake on their end. When I took it and it crashed the new style of questions really through me off, but because I had to do it again I bought the simulator as it was so highly recommended on reddit and ultimately worth it. I can't stress enough how valuable simulating the entire time and those newer style questions was and no other site offered that level of comprehensive test. Worth the $150 bucks.</Text>< Pics>

Prepcast PMP exam simulator is an excellent simulator. All questions requires understanding PMBOK processes and map it with predictive, adaptive and hybrid project methodology. I found many great information that really help me during real exam in this simulator. Some information that gives me more understand how to apply PMBOK and Agile concept into cases in real exam. I passed the exam with score above target for overall performance. Thanks prepcast PMP exam simulator to help me.</Text>

<Review>I made a good decision of buying PM prep cast simulator that helped me get through the CAPM exam. Simulator replicates 80 to 90% of the original PMI exams (not questions but just the interface) comprising pretty tough questions compared to other apps out there. Passing the exam in PM prep cast will surely help people to pass the final CAPM exam. I personally feel final exam is easier compared to the app. It is worth purchasing this app. Give it a try.< /Review>< Time>

<Text>I did PMP certification and pmprepcast pmp was of great help. So I did make a point to refer and enroll for PMI ACP prepcast and it has been of a great help to me. Worth the money spent. This is my first choice for video training for PMP and ACP certifications. Great work Cornelius Fichtner, PMP, CSM. Until Next Time ! Good Luck ! Good bye ! Take care<//Text>< Date>

I have got the PMP certification on Feb 11, 2021.
It has been a really hard exam with many question on Agile Approach and People management topic.
The PM Prepcast simulator has been really useful  and excellent because it has improved my mindset facing the PMP quiz and real exam simulation and providing really clear and understable explanation for each question.</Review>

<Review>This is a critical resource for anyone looking to pass the PMP exam on their first try. There is simply no substitute. I utilized only a portion of the simulator and was able to pass the exam on my first attempt. I highly recommend this investment. In hindsight I should have done all of my PMP education through this site.</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< rating>

<rate>5</rate><Review>Whether it's their training content, or customer care, PM PrepCast is simply next to none.

Their mock tests made me so equipped and confident that I finished my actual exam 40 minutes before the time limit! And of course, I passed it in the first attempt.

The difficulty that I faced in their mock tests, literally made me feel so comfortable during the actual exam that I felt as if I'm giving just another mock test.

And finally, I sincerely appreciate the way they responded to every single question that I had ever asked, and that too with an unparalleled courtesy and a personal touch!

People! You'll not pass the Exam without this package and you need no another one in addition to it! Yesterday, I passed the Exam successfully being not better than 75% on Prepcast Exam Simulator. The wording of exam questions were a little bit more straight forward and faster to read, but for almost all of the questions I could remind and associate a "Hint" as I could learn it by the Prepcast Exam Simulator. The team answers your questions very fast and precisely. Buy it, put Rita away and work it out! Good Luck!</text>

I passed the PMP exam yesterday and scored above target in all areas. It was my first attempt. I bought the prep cast exam simulator which was instrumental I believe in helping me to improve my critical thinking skills and application of logic in answering situational questions. Thanks again and keep up the good work!< /review>

The seminars are broken down in laymen terms (and a lot of times w/sense of humor)! I used 3 other virtual tools to initially prep for my exam but fell short by 1 point :-(

I used 2 good hard weeks (studied for 4-5 hours daily) to review the prep slides & took all with the practice test & also exhausted all the questions with practiced quiz (I always did timed). I also reviewed (at least twice) any questions i missed.

As the program suggested, i relaxed the day before (but lightly reviewed questions) my actual exam.

Thank you PM PrepCast!< /review>

The videos ensures to cover everything that is there in PMBOK and that helps to build up your confidence that you are not missing on anything.<//text><gmap_id>0x80dcdaea30496c3b:0x6197bf09e1400df8< /gmap_id><user_id>110977789701325128077< /user_id>< user_name>

I purchased the PMP study material a while back but got sidetracked and had to put off the exam. I then returned to study and passed the exam. I had various study material, but by far, the PM PrepCast got me beyond the finish line on my first attempt. This is well worth the time and effort if you want a fighting chance at a real-world exam environment.</review>

The PrepCast provides video lessons which are quite useful. I used them in conjunction with the exam simulator (which has to be bought separately, but is a must-buy), and passed the PMP exam on my first attempt. I can honestly say that while the PrepCast exam simulator stressed me out with its initial results, it prepared me well for the PMP exam. I had not taken such a long and tricky exam - well, ever. The actual exam ended up being simpler than the simulator for me.
PrepCast features:
- Videos are well presented, with lots of examples and tie-ins to the PMBOK guide for ease of following along
- There is an exhaustive table of contents, making it easy to focus on specific content areas of the PMBOK if that's what you need
- There are plans to help you manage your time so you can go at your own pace but optimize your project: Succeeding at the PMP exam
- The exam simulator provides plenty of options for taking full-length or shorter exams, going through answers, and checking areas where you are strong/weak for follow-up study (again, I highly recommend this, it was instrumental in my success)

All-in-all, a great tool for self-study at a fraction of the cost of most PMP preparation programs out there. I highly recommend it!</Review>

The only way to pass the exam is by reading the PMBOK, and understanding all the ITTOs, then just do PrepCast exams, very similar to the real exam. Personally, i would not pass the exam without PrepCast, very good job guys, amazing work!< /Review>

<Text>The PrepCast worked for me greatly, suggested to me by a friend who passed his PMP exam in first attempt. I only had a limited time to study this and attempt. Initially, I booked exam for 22nd on 10th of Dec but after attempting the 10 questions' small tests on PrepCast, my confidence level increased and I realized that I can pass my test in first attempt so pushed my exam date another 8 days. And YES, I did pass on the very first attempt. The questions in actual PMP exam were worded a bit different than PrepCast (for certain), but attempting 4 full tests on PrepCast gave me the whole idea of what am I up against.

Studying is definitely a must. I had access to Barbra Walter's videos from my job, which helped me make notes in ZIM Wiki to summarize my brain dumps for revisions. Multiple attempts on all the topics increased visibility on topics and it was amazing.

What can be improved in PrepCast is, giving choice of mixing the topics together for random tests rather than selecting one topic only. Because when you are attempting the one topic, you already know some of the answers. But when you are mixing the topics together then you get to pay a bit more attention.

One thing which is important is that in real PMP exam, the review screen came right after 90 question and I had no choice other than reviewing and then proceeding to rest of 110 questions. Whereas PrepCast simulator offers review of all questions at the end... So when using PrepCast, do it yourself so that you've a better idea of time management.</Text><pics>None<//pics><Response>{'time': 1614978339032, 'text': 'Congratulations on passing your exam on the first try!

Depending upon your budget and time to go over a lot of reviewers, you can consider  having PrepCast as your first item. For me, this is the only reviewer I can manage to take given my budget limitation and the time I have to review. I can say it is sufficient enough to pass the exam. Understanding of what they want to convey is the key and they are really very effective at that. Test questions are really close to what were asked in the real exam. They made me sleep well right after the exam. :)</review><Pics>None</Pics><response>{'time': 1598288017316, 'text': 'Thank you for leaving a great review, Sherry.

<Review>I have cleared PMP exam on Dec 29 2020, I am really happy that I could clear the exam with Above Target in all areas and also complete my exam in less than 3 hours.

I really wanted to share my experience to benefit the community. I have studied PMP exam with 3 courses that I purchased and watched many YouTube videos topics, but my test score after my preparation was around 40% and it got me really worried and I was disappointed. I have decided to go something different and I went with PMPrepcast Exam Simulator and I believe that is the best decision. I am very glad that I did that. After all our time is more valuable than the money. Exam Simulator in learning mode helped me a lot and gave me a very different perspective and mindset. It helped me with the pace and also taught me how to analyze the questions.

I am really thankful to this organization. Thank you PM PrepCast.< /Review><GmapID>0x80dcdaea30496c3b:0x6197bf09e1400df8</GmapID>< Response>

If you want to pass the PMP on the first try, this is your program.  Worked for me!  Cornelius and his team are absolutely phenomenal.  Cornelius is a great teacher, enthusiastic about the material, and really knows his stuff.  He does not simply read the PMBOK guide, but adds some personal stories and makes the lessons applicable.  I would recommend the PrepCast to anyone who wants to pass the PMP!< /Text>

I used the PrepCast program both for my exam preparation as well as the simulator for the exam in DEC 2020.  The program  critical to me passing the exam.  I prepped for 3 months using the videos, PMBOK and Rita Mulcahy's book.  But I can't say enough about the exam simulator!  It was an excellent resource for the study process, because it provided detailed answers for all questions, and helped me shift to thinking the PMI way.  It also helped me build my endurance for the 4 hour exam.  Thank you, Cornelius and the rest of your team!< /review>

To all PMP candidates, this is a must use tool.  I can openly and honestly say that PrepCast was THE ideal learning mechanism for me to build up the knowledge to pass the PMP exam on the 1st try.  Do yourself a favor and purchase this product and use for at least 1,500 practice questions and you wont regret it.< /review>

Passed the PMP exam in first attempt. Thanks to the PrepCast and the PMP Simulator that were key to my success.

PrepCast made it really easy to follow through the study material. I made detailed notes following along Cornelius’ video lessons, which became my go-through reference guide.

PMP Exam Simulator was the ultimate tool that I absolutely needed to ace the exam. These exams are well crafted to handle the situational questions in the real exam. Especially, at the end of each exam, every question is thoroughly reviewed to help understand the basis of selecting the right or wrong answer.

Thanks a lot team PM-PrepCast!< /Text>

I would highly recommend PMPrepCast!  I just passed the PMP 2021 Exam yesterday with 3/3 Above Targets and this company was instrumental in that process.

With the changes in the training from REP to ATP, I believe the PMPrep Cast Videos I watched are no longer viable, but I would still highly recommend PMPrep Cast.

I ordered their PMPrep Cast Elite, which included the Training Videos, Formulas, and a Study Guide. I also added on the PMPrep Exam Simulator 2021. The Exam Simulator is a MUST. There is an overall explanation summary for every question and then an explanation on each individual answer and why it is right and wrong, which is a great way to learn.

Also, PMPrep Cast has great customer service via email. I had a lot of questions in the beginning of the process and the team was very prompt to answer and helpful in sharing their own experiences.

And the last thing - is that Cornelius does Facebook Live events and those are a great way to get your questions answered directly from Cornelius himself, in real time.

Thank you, PMPrep Cast Team!<//Review>

<text>mock exams from project-management-precast are extremely helpful for candidates to prepare for highly situational questions. It not only explains why an answer is correct but also elaborates why other choices are incorrect. Its beauty is that candidates can practice in varieties of way such as based on knowledge area, processes,tools & techniques   etc . Its evaluation analysis carefully reflects area of strength and weakness of a candidate and provide right direction to improve.<//text>< Response>

The PM PrepCast Premium videos and Exam Simulator are highly recommended for anyone who wish to study at their own pace. You will need minimum 2 months to watch the 200+ videos and read the PMBOK Guide. The videos by instructor Mr.Cornelius will help in your PMP preparation. Good value for money.<//text>

I took PMP simulator from Prepcast in Nov 2020 for my exam that was scheduled in Dec 2020. It was a tough decision to select which venor to  chose as there are so many simulators available in market. After reading offerings from multiple vendors, i finally decided to chose Prepcast for 2 reasons:
1. They offered 8 sample papers
2. I was not sure if i will be able to clear my exam in Dec and was worried that a new PMP format will be released in Jan so i will have to buy a new simulator. PM prepcast was offering new version simulator free of cost with subscription. So i decided to go with Prepcast.

I was least confident in my preparation when i started taking tests. So, i read through their instructions on how to start using simulator.
Here is my experience:
1. I started with 20 questions to know how does simulator work
2. Then i took 50 questions random knowledge area test.
3. Then i reviewed all my responses and explanations. This was the best part as i could relate my logic to actual logic.
4. Response time of Prepcast customer service team is really very fast. I had few doubts and they immediately replied.
5. Then i started giving full 4 hour tests with 1 day of exam and 2nd day for review.
6. I cleared my PMP exam in first shot. Thanks to Prepcast.
7. 1 important point: The exam instructions and pre exam pointers and how to prepare for day of exam was very helpful. It helped to ease my nervousness.

Few improvement areas:
1. Actual exam gives 10 min break after 89th question. Prepcast should also add this feature. It is very difficult to sit for 4 hours without break as every minute is crucial while attempting exam
2. 3 months of validity period is too short. The time period should be extended.

Overall, i am happy and satisfied with my decision of chosing Prepcast. Thank you team.< /text>

I bought the PMPrepCast and it was of great value to me. I passed the PMP exam and can certainly confirm the mock exams are pretty close to the real exam. When I started the real exam and saw that the questions were the of the same type, I knew I wasn't in a strange land - I'd seen it, been there. So the exam went pretty smoothly for me from then on. I strongly recommend it. Cornelius has a very nice way of approaching the topics and the online classes are pretty nice.</review>

<review>Scheduled PMP exam in last week of Dec'20. Always knew that exam pattern will change in new year and had to clear the exam in 2020. Went through PMBoK and other exam prep book multiple times during preparation and understood that the only way to tackle situational questions is to solve as many mock questions as possible. That's where heard about PM Prepecast exam simulator.  Purchased it few days before exam. Took first mock exam and my weak areas got exposed. The excellent part of this simulator is it gives option to take "no pressure" learning quizzes on specific process group or knowledge area which helps build your confidence. You can also select number of questions you would like to answer in this quizz which is really helpful on-the-go. Solved approx 500 situational questions on this simulator before exam and cleared exam in first attempt on 28th Dec'20. Thank you PM Prepcast for such a wonderful tool. Cheers.<//review>< pictures>

2020 is a difficult year for many of the professionals trying to advance in one's career. The project management PrepCast was the best choice I made in this difficult time. The training was excellent and easy to understand. And most important, the support I got to extend because of a change in my schedule and work-life balance was overwhelming. I passed my exam today on the first try and I am truly grateful.</text>

What I would warmly recommend is to use PMP Exam Sumulator by Cornelius Fichtner (OSP International LLC) which helped me the most and definitely proved to be the best PMP exam simulator in the market. It is more than just PMP exam simulator, furthermore it can be described as great student PMP PrepCast manual.<//text>

< review>
After re-scheduling my exam 3 times, it took me 9 months to finally set on a date to take my PMP exam. Even so, 3 days before the exam, I have no confidence passing the exam at all as I have procrastinated a lot while studying the PMBOK guide. Luckily, I came across this website while searching for prep exam papers to help strengthen my weak understanding of the Project Management Processes. With the mindset that I need to pass the exam before they change the syllabus next year, I swept through 4 papers in 2 days. With all the explanations given in details on the questions that I have answered incorrectly, it helps build up my understanding and confidence (Note: I failed my 1st prep exam attempt before passing the remaining 3) going into the actual exam. Was pleasantly surprised that the way the exam questions were phrased were almost similar to the prep exam questions. Result? 4 Above Target and 1 On Target! It's really money well spent. I'm not encouraging anyone to follow my method of studying because it can be very taxing. However, if you are looking to build your confidence to pass the paper, this exam simulator is definitely the one you must get.< /review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>I would like to express my appreciation for the service that I have received from the PM Precast Team.

Two great benefits that I got from using the exam simulator are time management as well as determining the process group/knowledge area and process the particular question is based on.

The exam simulator contributed tremendously towards my pass of above target.

This product really works, it is a must have. After completing my 35  hours certification for the PMP with “eduhubspot.com” I used  Precast just over a month and completed over 900 questions. It is important to review all the answers/explanations to right and wrong Questions.  I worked small chucks of questions in groups 10s, 20s , 50s and 100s based on my schedule. It definitely increases your chances of passing the exam.< /text>

The PrepCast was key to my success. Being forced to switch between work, study and family stuff was distracting and stressful enough. The PrepCast lessons helped me by providing distilled knowledge: calling my attention to exactly what was important in the ocean of texts to read. Also, Cornelius style helped me to relax and focus on learning at the times I was stressed or tired. Last but not least, I would not have done it without the Simulator, don't even think about going to the exam without practicing with it.</Text>

I would like to thank the PM Prepcast team for creating a product worth investing. I cleared PMP last month and I certainly recommend it to anyone who aims to clear PMP with a good preparation. I purchased it 10 days before exam and I wish I had purchased it much before. The exam pattern and questions are so well designed and are very similar to real exam. One gets confidence and a better understanding of what he/ she is going to face in real exams. I had lesser time and so I could take only 4 full length mock tests but if you purchase it at least 2 months before your exam date, you will get adequate time to practise and gain confidence. Certainly it deserves 5 stars!!! Once again a big THANKS to the team. I passed PMP with 4 ATs 😊< /Text>

The PMP simulator package is well worth the money and a good investment to increase your chances to pass the PMP exam. The practice exams and quizzes are set up well. Take sufficient time to go through the answers and to read all the background explanation, this was very valuable and an important component in my preparation for the PMP exam. I have answered a total of 1305 out of the total 1610 questions in the PMP simulator and completed 6 out of the 8 exams.
I have passed the PMP exam in my 1st attempt, with above target for all 5 process groups.
I would like to give some recommendations for further development of the PMP simulator: The PMP simulator questions generally contain more context compared to the questions in the actual PMP exam. My suggestion is to include more ambiguous questions, only containing 1 sentence without much context, in the simulator. This was the most noticable difference comparing the simulator to the real exam.<//text>

<rating>5</rating><review>The PM Prepcast was the key resource for my passing the PMP with 3 ATs. After failing the test, I then learned of PM Prepcast through a Reddit form. I signed up for the PM Prepcast Premium package, studied and passed with a very solid performance.
There are elements that make the PM Prepcast a great study tool.
1. There are clear objectives for each topic. The length of each module is a perfect length for adult learning.
2. The modules are available as podcasts. I could listen while I went on my daily walk.
3. The test taking advice was very valuable. I took four full 200 question practice exams before I sat for the official PMP test. The content was very true to the format of the actual exam. I was mentally and physically ready for the exam.
4. Cornelius's tone and enthusiasm got me through all the processes.

I will be sure to purchase more learning from Cornelius Fichtner/OSP International  for continuing education and other PMI exam preparation.</review>< Pics>

I passed the exam on my first attempt and this was due in great part to this simulator. The simulator is not just a question bank but a reserve of explanations that clarify any doubts you may have of questions. Their  customer support is also very responsive and will clarify for you almost immediately any conflicts of perceptions you may have with questions on the platform.

For my exam preparation outside of the 36 hours of mandatory taught sessions I committed to steady preparations for roughly 2 months before the exam. During this period I dedicated every Sunday morning at 2 am to sit a mock exam for the full 4 hrs. Intermittently throughout the week i would then do 1 hr stints of 50 questions. The review of the questions you got wrong is what is ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL. This is where you get to really grasp the concepts and learn based on the responses and the explanations given. Doing this along with reading and listening to the RITA MULCHAY PMP Exam Prep book really prepared me for this exam.

It was a challenging experience coupled with work but was made bearable with these resources. All the best if you decide to take the plunge, it will be a rewarding experience.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

<pics>None< /pics><Text>I highly recommend using the PM PrepCast for the PMP exam.

My experience:
I worked through all of the PrepCast training course videos over a few months and took notes through each video. These videos are very detailed and this took a long time. After having a decent understanding of the concepts, I took the seven practice exams over about a month. I only referenced the PMBOK Guide when reviewing the practice exams. I then took the exam and passed. From start to finish, it took about 6 months while working fulltime. Felt like I actually over studied for the exam.

If I were to do it again:
I believe the PrepCast training videos are a great resource but the detail they go into is more valuable for overall PMP knowledge rather than for just passing the exam. I would have most likely just watched the videos and skipped taking notes. The real value from PM PrepCast are the practice exams. By working through them, reviewing incorrect answers, and then using the training videos or the PMBOK guide to review gaps, I think I could have passed the exam in 2 months. I also recommend Ricardo Vargas' video on the PMBOK Processes which layouts the overall flow of the PMBOK process/ knowledge areas.

Overall I believe the PrepCast training platform is a good value and can be used by itself to pass the exam.< /Text><user_id>100443267694725235705</user_id><rate>5<//rate></record>

< Review>
Passed the PMP exams in my first attempt. I did both Cornelius Fichtner's PMP Prepcast or Casey Ayer's training. I think both trainings really helped understanding the flow of the processes. Since the course is vast and i was attempting to study after a long time, i guess i needed more than one training :). The PMP exam simulator is excellent and absolutely essential for the exam. I practiced the learning quizzes after every knowledge area, then tried the 100 questions , then 3 or 4 of full length exams. The exams questions are very similar although the answer choices can be confusing in the real exams . I used process of elimination most of the time. Surprisingly i got 3 Critical path method questions in the exams, although i find those questions very easy when i write it down on a piece of paper , drawing it in the online Paint like whiteboard is time consuming. I got above target in 3 process groups. I would like to say Thanks to Cornelius and the PMP exam simulator, it really helped me pass. GO FOR IT!</Review>

The format for learning or timed quizzes was the key to my success. I would absolutely recommend this tool to anyone that is trying to get certified as a PMP! I passed the test a week ago and really do owe it to the simulator.< /review>< Response>

Hi PrepCast team
Thank you very much for the excellent support throughout my subscription with PrepCast.
I passed the PMP exam in Dec 2020, wouldn’t have made it without your excellent mock exam and explanation on why I got the wrong and right answers and referencing to the PMBOK page which improved my understanding and how to address the future questions. Notice that,   Prepcast question type/style is the most closest to PMP questions. Doing Prepcast questions daily gave me the confidence to take this exam.
Also thank you for extending the validity of PrepCast Exam Simulator subscription for extra 1 week to allow me to finish the exam. Much appreciated.
Regards

< Review>
I really enjoyed using the PM PrepCast program, from
the Podcast video lessons from Cornelius on my phone to the many practice exams. I especially enjoyed attending the weekend VIP boot camp with Coach Dan as well as the weekly sessions with him. The VIP sessions with Dan really helped me tie the concepts together, nail down my weak spots, and figure out what I needed to focus on. Dan was engaging, and I highly recommend the entire program. I passed AT/AT/AT/T/AT!< /Review>

I passed the PMP on the first attempt with above target in all areas. The prepcast is very long though.  I know they are trying to get you all 35 contact hours, but it seems like there are better ways for you to do that.  That being said, it was important to hear some of the details that you might otherwise miss in the 900 pages of documentation that the exam covers.  The real star is the exam simulator.  It really helps, and having the ability to get a small number of questions graded in a single go is key.  Sitting through a full 2-hr exam is difficult, especially if you are working full time, have kids, etc, it is hard to schedule more than a few opportunities to practice a full exam (I was only able to do that once).< /Text>

<Time>1605828551973</Time><text>Hi everybody,
First I purchased the small package with the videos. It was great to listen, but it is a lot of hours/material. I am not a native speaker and just the listening helped me a lot. As busy as we are all, if you work full time, I got lousy and did not spend soo much time as I should. Then I took advantage of the 4x 6am to 8am  class in August. The good thing about the class was, that you are morally forced to  listen to all the units to keep up. Could I have mastered the exam yet? No!
Fact is unfortunately, you have to dig in unit by unit and there is not really a lot of written material, so I made it myself, more just videos AND several 200 question exams!
This is, how I made it work: I printed 49 pages  with the title of each process and the definitions.  Every Sat. I took a 4h-exam and during the week, I reviewed  my mistakes and made notes in the different process sheets.
In addition, I developed also "documents" like the Project Charter, Project Management Plan, Scope Management Plan etc. and added information.
At the end, you have to learn it in your own way, paste and how you understand and memorize everything.=
Last Tuesday I passed on the first attempt.
Good Luck,
Judith Hage, PMP</text></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
I did all 8 sample exams from PrepCast. It helped me in getting a feel of sitting for 4 hours during the exam. It showed me any knowledge gaps I had and also testing what I learned.
The simulator gave a feel of how the questions could look in the exam - however I felt the simulator answers were more "straight forward" than the ones in the exam. I didn't have as much time to review my answers in the exam like I did in the simulator (due to more complex questions in the exam)
I would still recommend this exam simulator though - one of the more popular and affordable simulators out there.<//Review>

<review>I passed my PMP a few days back. I want to thank Cornelius Fichtner, the project management prepcast team and Prepcast forum. You guys rock. Without you guys and my very supportive family, I would not have passed.
Apart from the PMBOK, I just used the prepcast videos and the PM exam simulator. The best thing about the pm-prepcast is that the videos can be downloaded using the podcast app. I would listen to the videos on my way to work and back. In the night, I prepared notes on whatever I listened. Early December, I wrote the 25 question exam got the contact hours and filled up the application for my exam. The PM exam simulator  questions were at the level of the real PMP exam. I wrote 5 of the 8 mock exams and shored up my weak points. The agile chapter, special chapter on earned value were helpful in answering any questions in these areas. I would strongly recommend PM prepcast for anyone preparing for the PMP.<//review>< Rating>

After failing twice using other testing materials and training from another vendor I switched to using prepcast and the pmbok guide exclusively for my study. I'm happy to say this tool pushed me over the top and increased my score from just below the line of passing all the way up to just between target and above target. Great tool.

I used the PM PrepCast course to study for the PMP exam over about 2 months.  I also used Rita’s book and watched several helpful YouTube videos.  Finally, practicing with the Exam Simulator gave me a ton of confidence that I was ready for the actual exam.  It helped a lot to be able to review questions I answered incorrectly or marked for review - and see explanations for why each answer was right or wrong.  Passed on my first try!</Text>

<review>The PMP exam simulator was my savior. It mimics the format and style of the real exam. The real PMP exam questions are ambiguous. This PMP exam simulator will give you the best edge for how to answer those questions.

They have a learning option; you can choose which domain and how many questions you want. This was great for learning the info. There are explanations for each answer, whether correct or incorrect. The 200 question timed exams are great once you're ready to schedule the exam. I passed on my first try and had 38 mins left on the clock.

Regrettably, I used a different vendor for the training needed to apply for the PMP. I wish I would have gone with PM PrepCast for that too.</review>< pics>

<rate>5<//rate><review>FROM FAIL TO PASS IN 10 DAYS!

Good Day All.

My success story was crowned toady Wednesday 24th December 2020,around 2am (WAT).

I wrote the PMP exam on Monday 14th December 2020, but failed it, even though I was Above Target in three (3) areas.

I was discouraged but decided to reschedule it for Wednesday 23rd December 2020, just 9 days after I wrote it.

I knew I had to do a crash course and needed simulation exams, so I searched on Google and the success stories I saw, convinced me of PM PrepCast PMP simulation exams.

I purchased the PMP simulation exams on Wednesday 16th December 2020 and with a spirit of revenge, aggressively did as many tests and reviews as I could.

The explanations of the PrepCast Exam answers were top notch and I was able to discover and fill gaps in my knowledge.

Even though I did only 6 out of the 8 tests in the simulation, as the time to retake was very short, the exam simulations helped me turn my Fail to Pass, after 10 days.

I initially thought it impossible, but the simulation exams built my knowledge and confidence, to retake and pass the exam.

PM PrepCast is a must have for anyone who desires to pass the PMP.

Will surely recommend to anyone who intends to take the PMP exam.

I am grateful to the PM PrepCast Team.</review><Response>{'time': 1610751141650, 'text': 'We are glad that you found us! Thank you for sharing your experience and the great review. Congratulations on passing your exam!'}</Response>< Date>

I thank Cornelius Fichtner for developing such amazing exam simulator called Prepcast exam simulator. It is THE best when it comes to testing your knowledge related to PMP exam. I used many free question banks but then decided to buy the Prepcast simulator. It was my best decision to do so. The questions are of very high quality and the explanation opens one's thinking and help plugging the gaps in knowledge. There are many options to review your answers, your exams and so on. Prepcast is best !!!! Keep up the good work guys.< /review>

At the end of the day the PM-Prepcast was awesome, and it definitely helped me pass the exam. Not only were the podcasts great and convenient, but the practice/simulation questions were very similar to those on the actual exam. Thanks PM-Prepcast! And Godspeed to all preparing for their certification!
My process - Purchased PM PrepCast Elite on 8/19. Built a plan to listen to all of the podcasts over the course of a few weeks. Took notes in Excel as I was listening, and would pause if I needed to really comprehend what I was hearing/seeing. I'd do multiple videos per day, typically 2.5 hours or so at 1x speed...but a great personal hack of mine is to listen to podcasts at 2x to get through them quicker. As an experienced PM going into my certification studies, I already 'knew' a ton of the material. Because of this, also, I didn't think it was necessary to purchase the PMBOK Guide. Upon registering to apply for the exam, I went ahead and purchased membership to the PMI, which includes the 6th Edition of the PMBOK Guide, and net it was a little cheaper than just paying for the exam. Upon completion of the podcast plan, I went through each knowledge area of the PMBOK Guide and highlighted key points that seemed like great exam material. I went back through this the week leading up to the exam, honing in on the areas that I highlighted. I also took a number of timed quizzes to get a feel for the material and the timed nature. I'm very happy I did. The longest I did was 100 questions (i.e., half of the actual exam). The actual exam that I passed on 12/14 was LONG.</review>

<Review>I passed my PMP exam on Dec 10th 2020; It was my second attempt after I failed PMP test in July this year. Well, that was mostly my fault as I believed my experience would be mostly enough to pass the exam…Here is a short summary of my preparation for the first PMP exam attempt in July:
I did watch all Prep Cast videos but I also skipped some video content assuming I had that particular knowledge already (huge mistake). I practiced using Exam Simulator too, but only for about two weeks prior to the exam (not enough). I failed exam.
Then, here is how I prepared for my second PMP exam attempt in December:       I watched again all PrepCast instructional video files (no fast forwarding this time…),       I made ‘Mind Maps’ for each knowledge area where I connected experience from my work to the Project Management knowledge areas and tools&techniques; I practiced with Exam Simulator for about 4-5 weeks prior to the exam. I passed exam.
PrepCast: Great source of Project Management knowledge – but make sure you go through all material!
Exam Simulator: Do not even try to attempt PMP examination without practicing on simulator...for more than 2 weeks!<//Review>< name>

I completed all of the lessons in about 9 weeks and also purchased the simulator which I highly recommend.

<text>Passed my PMP exam in first attempt with overall score of AT. I read PMBOK Guide 3-4 times and used PMP Exam Simulator. Questions on exam were similar to their simulator and learning quizzes were very helpful to clarify concepts. Do take at least one 4hrs practice test before attempting the real exam. All the best!

And also don't forget to visit their forum. They are really helpful esp. Lessons learned.< /text>< resp>

If you plan to take your PMP then the simulator is a must. It has numerous situational questions which are well designed and thought off.
The review mentions the reason for correct as well as incorrect choices and you will also find reference to PMI PMBOK page on most questions so that you can jump there and clarify/brush up your concepts. Highly recommended.<//text>

<pictures>None< /pictures><Review>I just passed the PMP on my first try and I attribute my success to utilizing the PrepCast simulator. I answered over 1400 unique questions, took 9 full practice exams and 30+ quizzes. I loved how the simulator tracked my scores for each test/quiz. This allowed me to focus on specific knowledge and processes where I needed additional studies. What I found most helpful, was understanding why my answer was wrong and why 2 other choices were too. Since each answer references the PMBOK, I would go back to it to read that section for more detail.

The PrepCast customer service was excellent! Quick responses to any questions I had about the program. There are also some "freebies" available on the PrepCast website.

I am going to pursue the PMI-ACP and will be utilizing their programs to gain PDUs and access to test simulator.

I HIGHLY recommend this company for anyone wanting to feel confident about taking the PMP test. The actual exam was very similar to the PrepCast practice tests and I felt prepared!

<review>Great thanks to Cornelius Flitcner!

I passed the PMP exam at first try after practicing with the simulator for less than 2weeks.

Any PMP aspirant who studies all the materials in the simulator in a committed manner and reviews the answers thoroughly with good understanding will surely pass the PMP exam at first try. It worked for me, it could work for you too!

Good luck, guys!

Hi Team,
Would like to say a BIG THANKS to the prepcast team as I cleared my PMP exam on 19th Oct'2020 with 4AT and 1T. The way the entire PMP simulator course contents have been designed really trains the mind to prepare for the final exam and the best part is statistics which gives an idea on weak areas. I gave all 7 exams along-with ITTO and never turned back. Once again thanks a lot for helping in my journey. All the best.</Text>

I found this function very useful. I did full CAPM Simulator in 5 days and pass PMI exam  with above target. My goal is PMP this December so I was studying before of course but PrepCast help me a lot in gaining my first step  - getting CAPM  Cerificate</text>< Pictures>

The Project Management PrepCast and PMP Exam Simulator were instrumental in my studying, knowledge development, and preparation for the PMP Exam. With the assistance of the recorded videos, exhaustive notes, and ability to take exam level practices in short and long sittings was invaluable. The investment in the PrepCast and simulator paid dividends and supported my success with actual exam; passed on the first attempt. Massive shout out and support for this training tool.< /review>

I got Above Target in all 5 process groups. Here is my take on Prepcast.

Prepcast is a great tool to pass your PMP. It has scenario based questions to get us ready for real exam. I recommend to use Prepcast exam simulator in the following way to get best results after attending instructor lead training for PDUs.

1. First read PMBOK once. Do not spend more than 2 hours for each chapter (3+ 10 process groups).
2. Attempt 2 full tests and review each question (each review takes 6-8 hours as you need to understand why your is answer is right/wrong and other choices are right/wrong.
3. Read PMBOK again. This time, you will get to know what to read precisely from the review exercise. Highlight important points on PMBOK. You may spend 1-1.5 hours on each chapter this time.
4. Attempt 3 more tests. This time, review only incorrect questions.
5. Skim through PMBOK. This time hardly 30 minutes for chapter. Attempt last 3 tests. You will see improvement in your percentage.
6. Use right click option to strike and eliminate the wrong options. This is very important. When you look at answers, you can eliminate 2 easily. Strike them off. After selecting what you think is correct, do not strike the closest answer option. When reviewing incorrect answers after exam, read the reason why the closest answer is right. If the correct answer is not the one you chose or the closest answer option that you didn't strike, it means you either have been doomed or got that concept completely wrong into your mind. Revisit this concept on PMBOK.
7. ITTO test (8) is not much useful for real exam. Don't worry if you got even 50% in that test. More than 80% are scenarios based and 18-19% are direct answers. You may get 3-4 questions related to ITTO.
8. if you score around 75%, you will feel that the real test is far more easier than these practice tests. I felt it.

Use this simulator effectively and streamline your thoughts from concepts to correct answers to the questions.

All the best for your PMP examination.<//review>

Hi,

I was studying casually now n then little bit since October 2020 and had a plan to appear in exam by first quarter of 2021 due to my work load. It was an eventful morning on Nov 05, 2020 when i came to know that PMP exam is changing from January 02, 2020, i got petrified that i have only 2 months and i havent studied anything, i thought to give up but then saw 2 videos of PMP passed professionals who prepared for their exam in 14 & 30 days, it gave me some hope, one of them advised to subscribe to PMP PrepCast Exam Simulator.
I started my serious studies from Nov 06, 2020 and on Nov 11, 2020 i subscribed to PMP exam simulator. i found it really helpful in my preparations as it made me visualize the processes. The details are provided about each question and option which is very helpful.
I am delighted to announce that today i passed my PMP exam in first attempt :) well, even i cant believe it :)
thank you so much PrepCast.

Cheers

P.S. Please add more questions with min 2 appropriate/close answer choices out of which the candidate has to choose the best< /Text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>Cornelius Fitchner is a household name among PMP aspirants in online communities like reddit. His Prepcast Exam Simulator was instrumental in my preparation for the PMP exam. I passed my exam last week with 4ATs and 1T. Although I used other study guides, on the basis of my experience with the Exam Simulator alone, I would highly recommend Prepcast products to all PMP aspirants.

The Exam Simulator offers full exams or shorter quizzes in a learning mode and timed mode. I believe there are 1600 possible questions and you can chose whether or not you want your tests to draw upon previously answered questions. When taking a quiz, you have the option to select how many questions you’d like and from what process group.

Learning mode is not timed, offers hints, and you can review your answer as soon as you’ve answered the question.

Timed mode simulates the actual exam.

In both instances, the correct answer is thoroughly explained, and each incorrect answer includes a brief description of why it is wrong and/or not the best answer. This point is particular important because you will face many difficult situational questions on the exam where they are two plausible answers but only one it the best. Each correct answer is linked to a specific page in the PMBOK.

Once you complete your exam or quiz, you revived a pass or fail mark which also indicates your % correct and an analysis of how you performed in each KA and PG. This is what I used to guide my studies.

You can also compare your scores to other users which serves as another indicator of your exam readiness.

While there is no guarantee that good marks on the simulator will mean that you pass the actual exam, people report that when they are in the 75%+ range with the simulator, you are ready for the actual exam.

Best of luck to you!!<//Review>< pics>

<name>Yevhenii Kundii</name><text>Hi everyone,

I would like to thank the PrepCast team for creating such a beautiful, practical, and useful product, this is the moment when I can undoubtedly say that it worth its price.

I failed the first PMP attempt and when started the preparation for the 2nd attempt, the goal was to concentrate mostly on the practice tests that exactly PrepCast helped me with. The wide bunch of functionality will help you to analyze your weaknesses and strengths.

As a final result: passed the PMP exam having all 5 process groups with Above Target.

Recommended, you will not regret it.< /text>< Time>

I bought PMP Exam Stimulator and formula list in preparation for my exam and it was the best investment I could've made. The questions in the stimulator were challenging but at the same time I found myself learning even more than I did from the course I took separately. What I loved about the exam stimulator is that every question I came across, there was a thorough explanation for each option and where you could find the explanation in the PMBOK as well. I'm thrilled to say that I passed my PMP exam on the first try! I'm considering doing the PMI-ACP Elite package with PrepCast as well. Highly recommend!< /Text>

<rate>5</rate><review>I purchased the PMP Exam Simulator based upon the 6th Edition of the PMBOK after failing on my initial attempt to pass the exam. Previously, I took a "boot camp" from another commercial entity that came with both a study guide  and a different exam simulator, but after taking the exam, I came to the opinion that both were of lower quality than what was needed to pass.

PM Prepcast's PMP exam simulator was light years ahead of the other entity's products. When they say "exam simulator," they mean it. The questions are structured in a way that is similar to what I saw on the exam (both are written to make damn good and sure you actually understand the source material), but both the explanations to all of the choices offered in a given question, and reference all the way to the PMBOK are where this product really shines. It seemed like every time I answered a question, I came to a better understanding of WHY the correct answer was the BEST choice, and how the other answers were either flat-out wrong, or not "correct enough."  I took the exam again last week, and passed it. I got "Above Target" for the Initiating, Planning, and Executing domains, and "Target" for the Monitoring/Controlling and Closing domains. All 5 domains saw increased scores compared to the use of the other entity's product.

I recommend PM Prepcast's PMP exam simulator in the highest possible terms. In my opinion, it would be a steal even if it were priced significantly higher. I look forward to seeing if this company also has PDU options available to keep my new cert current.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

I found this to be an excellent prep tool for the PMP certification.  The questions presented in the prep exams were similar to those on the exams.  In addition, the content of the questions led me to study additional material that I had not previously reviewed which further prepared me for the exam.  I passed the exam with above target scores in all knowledge areas and would highly recommend the exam prep as study material.</review>

The Exam Simulator is a must-have for the PMP exam prep. Not only the correct answer is given, but the situation and background is explained and also all of the wrong answers are explained in detail. The 8 exams with 200 questions each are inevitable in prepping for the exam and this is the best option, could not have done without. Thanks Cornelius and team!< /text>

<Text>I highly recommend PMP Prepcast. I used it predominantly for the exam simulator module which did a phenomenal job in preparing me for the exam. The format that they use is well done because of how similar the questions are to the real ones, and how detailed the explanations are for why the correct answer is correct and why the other choices are incorrect. There are other (more expensive) prep tools that offer the same module but the questions are not the same quality. Instead of a scenario based question, it will be defining inputs/outputs/tools & techniques. These types of questions are ok but do not prep you for the type of questions that will be on the real exam.

I would strongly advise PMP aspirants to use this simulator module as the basis of your prep. It teaches you the concepts while simultaneously giving you exposure to what exam day will be like. Thank you PMP Prepcast.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>{'time': 1604089852130, 'text': 'Congratulations on passing your exam!

<Review>I recently passed the PMP exam and I credit much of my success to the training I received from the Project Management PrepCast course. Cornelius Fichtner does a great job teaching the PMBOK material and his 60 plus hours of presentation information covers all the key aspects needed to successfully pass the PMP exam.  I recommend including Cornelius’s PMP Exam Simulator as it provides excellent examples of the types of PMP exam questions you will experience during the 4-hour exam.</Review><Time>1603726883537<//Time>< gmapID>

I passed my PMP exam on 18Oct2020. I had purchased PM PrepCast (Premium) along with PMP Exam Simulator. I can vouch for the quality of content. I tried other sample tests and simulators from other sources as well but based on my experience I can say that PMP Exam Simulator of PM PrepCast is closest to the real PMP exam. It really tests how well you have read and understood PMBOK guide and prepares you well for the PMP exam.< /Review>

I purchased the PM Exam Simulator in preparation for my PMP exam. This was by far the closest to taking the actual PMP exam! Take all the exams and practice questions...you'll be 100% prepared for the exam. I passed on my 1st try :)< /Text>

Extremely amazing simulator exams!!! Just understanding the concepts is not always sufficient to clear the exams. A simulator is needed to practice and the questions on PM PrepCast is very much similar to that of the actual exam, but a little more complicated. Because of that, I found the actual exam very easy and got the 'Above Target' rating for every domain.<//review>

Excellent source for exam preparation - I made significant progress going through all the mock exams, and scored 5ATs for my PMP exam at first attempt. The questions are high quality and the explanations helpful and detailed, even going down to explaining why each of the four options are right or wrong. Anything more to clarify I just had to look to the forum.

Minor suggestions to help personalize the learning journey will be to allow user to switch to training mode for the mock exam such that it is no longer timed. I was also puzzled that I couldn’t access my earliest exam attempts for review - recent exams only show up to 5 most recent exams.<//review>

<text>If you want pass the exam you will need the rigth tools and for sure this one is a must have in your tool kit. My journey started with the books that everyone recommends however when i did the free simulators on the web or in some books i didn´t get above 85% and the answers on them some times wasn´t clear for me so, i decided to try with simulator  i found it so useful because it provided me useful statistics that used to identified my weaknesses and tackle them, also it provides you clear explanations and the reference to the PMBOK, that help me to understand why i was wrong. My approach was the next, i did quizzes of 25 or  50 questions depending of my time available after that i reviewed the explanations of the questions in which i had had doubts and of course the incorrect ones,  after identify my weaknesses i review the materials and i focused on this areas, after some weeks i got above the 85% recommended in my last quizzes, so  I decided to schedule my exam and after the 200 hunddred question i got the message "congratulations... "" i had passed with all above target, this simulator make feel confortable during the exam. By the  way i didn´t do the whole questions of the simulator i did around the half of them, thanks guys to help me to reach my goal.< /text>< Rate>

Best way to prepare for PMP is to take as many online test as possible and the prepcast is one of the platform where you will experience to take up many questions and thereby one can draw their understanding from PMBOK. Prepcast simulator helped me in cracking PMP in first attempt and I recommend for it.<//text>

<Text>The PMP Exam Simulator was, without question, the resource that made the difference between passing and not passing the PMP exam.  It provides 1400 questions (1600 if you count the ITTO questions), but the answers are the key component; in learning mode, you can see the correct answer, why it's correct, how they arrived at that answer, and an explanation of each remaining choice for why they're incorrect or not as good.  If you use this as a learning tool rather than purely as an assessment tool, you will almost certainly be able to pass the PMP.  I recently passed the exam with Above Target in every section and would not hesitate to recommend this program to other candidates.<//Text>< Pictures>

This is a great Simulator managed to pass my PMP on the first try and a big part was my experience with the simulator...

One point was with respect with the timer ⏱ the counts backwards by the hours

The actual exam countdown by the minutes .... that messed my up in terms of planning my time spent for the questions but actually made me work faster and I half an hour for review 😊< /review>

I purchased PM Prepcast to get an idea of the exam questions. After clearing the PMP exam with "Above Target" in all domains and in first attempt, I can definitely recommend this to PMP aspirants. The questions are quite similar to the real exam questions i.e. situation based. The detailed description for the wrong questions also help in understanding the misconceptions and/or any gaps in understanding. The simulator allows small quizzes (10-100 questions) that you can take according to the free time you have, and 8 full length Mock exams that simulate the exam environment i.e. time. Highly recommended!<//Review>

Its a good experience and found this as a revision note due to the detailed explanation of each answers to each questions. I have a request:
My PMP Exams is on the 17th October and my PMP exam simulator expires by 2nd October. I want to make a request that it should be extended by one week for me to have more practice close to the exam date.
Kindly consider doing me the favour.<//text>

The Mock Test for the PMP Exam proved to be wonderful assistance as i was appearing for the PMI-PMP EXAM this morning. I never thought the pattern followed by PrepCast would be so close to the real pattern. It was a great booster through out the 4 hrs period while i was in. Thanks a lot to all who worked on this subject. Regards Sunil Bhola< /Review>

PMP Exam Simulator, PM PrepCast, by Mr. Cornelius Fichtner helped me prepare and pass my PMP exam with the grade "Above Target".
I am very gratefull for this and would recommend to everyone who is preparing for the PMP exam to try it.
One of the greatest things in the simulator is the Timed & Learning Quizzes option, which uses the same question pool as exams but gives you opportunity to choose number of questions (1, 20, ..., 100) and there is no time limit, so you can practice as long as you want and take breaks when ever you need, no time pressure.
Wish you all to pass the exam!<//Review>

I have just completed my OnVue PMP Exam and Aced it with 5 Above Targets in all domains.

Thanks to Pmp Prepcast as I have praticed all 6 out of the 7 full exams and the ITTO exam. I averaged 78.5% in first attempt. I never scored more than 81% and below 74% on all tests. The level of Prepcast exam difficulty is slightly higher than that of the PMP exam however it is preferred to practice with harder exams to achieve best results.

Highly Recommended!!<//review>

The online program is suitable for working people. It makes life easier to get the required 35 hours Project Management Course certificate. Especially at this time of pandemic, it is more safer and cheaper to enroll in an online course.

Keep up the good work! It helps me a lot in achieving my goal to be a PMP certified.

<review>I used the simulator tool.  It is the best one out there by far.  Realistic questions that make sense (I did all 1,610 questions), full and complete logic and explanations for all answers and a lot of options for short tests, timed tests and tests focused on specific knowledge areas or domains.  You get great metrics that show you how you are doing and there are pull-downs to eliminate questions you have already answered correctly. I passed today on my first attempt with exceed target thanks in big part to the simulator.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

I practiced the PM PrepCast simulator questions for my PMP exam and was able to pass with Target and Above Target. Retaking the quizzes over and over again enabled me to learn how to read the questions properly and decipher what information is relevant to the question. You'll also learn to point out key words that are important as well. The length and wording of the questions are similar to the exam which helped tremendously. Once you're done with the quizzes/exams, each question and answer will have explanations to help your understanding.

The only thing that I found different on the exam is that the simulator has options that are a little obvious as to what is right and wrong. The exam usually has two obvious wrong answers and 2 possible right answers.

Overall, I'm very happy I purchased the simulator and practiced the questions to prepare me for the PMP exam.</Review>

Best ever simulator. Prepcast molded me easily to clear my PMP in first attempt. I took 6 mock from Prepcast, infact PMP exam questions were so easy compared to Prepcast. So, I strongly suggest everyone to opt for Prepcast Mock and do least 5 mocks to boost your confidence. Worth for Money.< /review>

I have just took the exam and passed the 1st attempt!
The tool allows you to be really prepared, learn how to manage exam time correctly, and identify areas to reinforce your knowledge. The questions are very much alike the real exam, and full exams allow you to be in an environment also very similar to the real exam.
Timed & Learning Quizzes are equally great as the resolution of questions refer to the exact topics of PMBOK and present the rationale behind each alternative, and allow people with few time available to perform smaller set of questions on both computer and smartphone.

I truly recommend using this simulator as a tool for anyone preparing for PMP Exam!</Review>

The questions and format of the PMP simulator exams were 98% of what the actual PMP exam were like.  Only format differences and the use of a whiteboard and calculator were the only differences.   Question content was dead on.
Taking the simulator exams and understanding why I missed what I missed was absolutely invaluable.</Text>< pictures>

Happy to share that I passed with an above average score. The questions on the simulator are practical, the answers are very explanatory, the breakdown of scores allows you to identify and focus on areas of weakness. I would recommend to everyone I know that is preparing to write their PMP exam.
I'm really glad I used this tool.

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><Review>Like many people who decided to go for PMP journey, I researched some on-line courses and compared with sample contents and some evaluations on the web  for a few days. And I selected PM Precast this Spring & passed the exam last weekend in my first try.

If I say this one is the best on-line course in the market, I must be lying. Because I didn't took the other ones and no enough data to compare them with this one. Saying like that is not fair & I don't want to pretend to know about something I really don't know.

But what I can say is that I've never regretted my decision in a single moment since I started this course. All the contents, guidance, support, were all beyond my expectation. And without this, I would'n have passed. That's something that I will tell if my friends want to go for the PMP journey and ask my advise.<//Review></record>

Great study program.  Gives you the 35 education credits you need to apply for the exam and teaches you as well.  The only thing I would say is that it would be nice if you could speed up the presentations to go a little faster but otherwise, the explanations were thorough and well put together.  The simulator was also the best I found.  The explanations as to why each possible answer was incorrect and the overall answer was great and it's honestly how I learned most everything.  The grammar used was also great, which I did not find in other exam simulators.  I passed on my first attempt and would suggest the PM PrepCast to others for sure!<//text>

When searching for PMP simulator You always ask Yourself, is it adherent to reality or not? Well this one is, exam questions were slightly easier but articulated with different english, but if You follow the simulator You will pass. Very good the motivation to all the answers.<//review>

<text>I purchased the PMP Exam Simulator and it was awesome! I recently passed the PMP exam on my first try and I can definitely say the simulator was as close as you can get to the real exam. The best part is the detailed explanation of the answers, and why the wrong answer you selected was wrong. I would definitely recommend to anyone taking the PMP exam. Definitely worth the investment in yourself!< /text><pics>None</pics><UserId.>109570169285626808130<//UserId.><Name>Adannia Eze</Name><Gmap_id>0x80dcdaea30496c3b:0x6197bf09e1400df8</Gmap_id></record>

I took and passed the PMP exam in March 2020 on my first sit. The PM PrepCast was an instrumental part of my preparation. Taking the 4-hour simulation exams taught me endurance, and the report for each test I took assisted me to identify and fill knowledge gaps.</Text>

I used the exam simulator to prepare for PMP exam. Passed the exam with 5 AT (avg on prepcast was 80-85%). The simulator is a good instrument to prepare for the exam, I have to say though that the questions on the exam are far more difficult than the simulator (you will find the same problem with each simulator, I tried others questions). Explanations are very satisfactory. I would suggest to include in the simulator a calculator or a whiteboard to better 'simulate' the real exam.</Text>

Look no further, the PM Prepcast is the real deal. I spent a year studying other courses, simulators and materials online before I found PM Prepcast in the last month and can tell the difference right away.
PM Precast helped me to wrap up the concepts and gain new understanding on the PMBOK, which is key to me passing the exam on my first try.
Thank you PM Prepcast.</review>

I relied on Prepcast to refine my understanding of PMBOK concepts in the final stage of my PMP prep. Relied heavily on quizzes and then switched to full-sized tests. The descriptions of right and wrong answers were well written and helpful. For me, this was a critical step for passing the PMP<//text>

<Text>I've really enjoyed the PMI ACP exam preparation course. Not only the material being presented is great, but also the way it is presented makes it very easy and intriguing to follow. It's a combination of history, theory, and real-life examples, and the instructor's way of talking is anything but monotone; he's excited and keeps me excited about the material he's presenting!< /Text><Time>1588561391660</Time></record></dataset><record>

I started out with Rita's material, read the entire book and took notes and did her Simulated Exams.  Then I created a Mind Map of the entire ITTO.  Finally I got to the Prep Cast and it was the final missing piece.  The simulator does a great job in addressing the next level of learning because it is directly connected to PMBOK.  1400 questions spread out over the entire PMBOK range addresses the subtle nuances indicated in the BOK.  The Agile questions are also a plus.  The best part of the Simulator is the Post Exam data with the plethora of metrics and data provided so you could track your performance.

With all humility I am proud to say I passed in the Above Target range and would recommend this product to anyone who is on this quest.  One minor comment for the Exam Simulator would be to have an "on board" calculator so the experience is closer to the actual exam which helps reduce stress levels on Exam day.< /review>

<Review>PrepCast worked very well for me and my schedule.  I was able to review the content and review whenever I liked.  I also purchased the PrepCast Exam Simulator using the quizzes throughout my preparation and taking 5 practice exams over 2 weeks before my exam.  I am happy to report that I passed the exam with "above target" scores in all Domains.  Highly recommended program!<//Review><pics>None</pics><resp>{'time': 1570192101130, 'text': "Congratulations on passing your exam, Michael.

< Review>
This exam simulator is a great tool for preparing PMP exam. I attended 10 tines quize and 4 full test just before my PMP exam. When I sat for PMI PMP exam, I was surprised that the question pattern is so much similar to the Prepcast simulator. During PMI exam, Just it gave the feeling that I am giving prepcast mock test which enhanced my confidence level. So thanks prepcast team to provide such an ausome simulator tools to us.< /Review>

The practice tests were hard, but the closest I've seen to the actual test.  I passed the PMP after I had gone through the videos and took the practice exams.< /Review>< Pics>

I used the PrepCast exam simulator in addition to another exam simulator after taking a course with TIA and passed the PMP exam on the first attempt; I would highly recommend this exam simulator, however, due to it having an expiration date, I would plan accordingly.</Text>

I started studying the Rita's book in January, with a goal to finish it in the middle of February, which I did. I took notes and did well in all the tests. I was going to follow that up with a company sponsored boot-camp, but my new colleague swore by the PrepCast as a major reason why she passed her PMP test. I decided to save my company a couple of thousand dollars by opting for the PrepCast instead.

I scheduled my exam for March, but that was cancelled due to COVID-19 pandemic. I was able to reschedule it as an online proctored exam in April and passed it with an overall "above target" grade.

The PrepCast was definitely the best thing I could have bought and used to supplement my studying. The key, for me, was paying close attention to the questions I got wrong and reading the explanations to really understand why the right answers were indeed the correct answers. If you do that and pass the practice tests, you should have no problem passing the PMI exam. ...Thank you, PrepCast team.

Cheers,

I passed my first effort.  The materials available are excellent.  The two items I purchased were PrepCast and the Exam Simulator.
PrepCast
When listening to PrepCast you must pay attention.  Don't watch TV at the same time.  I often listened while taking my morning walk.  Often I would follow in PMBOK.
Exam Simulator
After going throught PrepCast,  the Exam Simulator was used first to take untimed quizzes.  I took a few dozen 30 question, untimed tests and often took tests including only those questions that were incorrect. (600 database plus questions).  My initial scores correct ranged from just over 50% to 62% so don't be discouraged.   I used the "snipping tool" to print all errors AND those questions that were correct but not clearly fixed in my mind.   I probably printed over 1000 pages. When I got my percent up a little and had reviewed all incorrect questions...ONLY THEN did I take Exams 1-3.  Same process here, took the exams untimed first, reviewed incorrect questions and correct questions I was not completely clear on.  I kept stacks of paper roughly sorted from unlearned to unsure.  I got my correct % up to around 85-90%.  Then did my final reviewing before the test - mostly with the printed paper of those questions I was unsure of.  during that final week I went back to review questions I answered incorrectly along with the paper.  My final review was for about a week 4 hours per day including Sat and Sun pretty much for 7 days.

Of course the questions are not the same as on the actual test but the more effort you put in...the better you will do.  Good luck to all.< /text>

UPDATE: They responded over the weekend and sent me my login info. Will update review to 5 stars if I pass PMP exam. Thank you very much for your assistance!

Extremely frustrated and disappointed. I purchased this product based on all the raving reviews and received an email confirmation of my payment but I have not received any instructions to access PMP PrepCast exam simulator. I checked my junk mail, nothing. I tried signing up for the free version of the simulator with my gmail, hotmail, bellsouth.net and aol.com accounts and NONE of them worked. I checked junk mail for all of them. I checked their knowledge base and apparently this is a known issue. I sent an email to support services and was told I need to wait until Monday for them to respond. I purchased this product expecting immediate access so that I could study over the weekend. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED.</review>< pictures>

Think 5 stars are not enough for how great this simulator is. I was very disciplined in my studies. My kids who are so sweet knew mom is studying for PMP.

I have not touched PMBOK even once. I went thru the videos and the simulator. Completed 1600 questions. Loved the way it makes your brain think the answers. Reading the answers was a key to success. I did not take 200 questions, infact I mastered the Knowledge Area. So completed as many questions on simulator per KA.

PMP real life questions were way easier than the simulator. So if you have mastered this simulator, probably you are ready to take the test next day.
I completed the exam in 2 hours 45 mins. It was a breeze. Loved seeing the congratulations note.

** If you are taking exam from home, the pearsonvue does hang. So have patience when that happens during the exam and work with the proctor to resolve issues.

The trick that worked for me is I put in all Processes in the excel and noted the output. (Not the tools and techniques) . This brings a flow to your studies. Once I was clear with outputs, I studied Tools and Techniques. And No, you dont need to remember everything.

Many thanks to Cornelius and team for contributing to PMP learning. Now I am heading for PMI ACP and PREPCAST is the obvious choice.< /review>

But their simulator is out of the world, probably the best in the industry. In usage, it's as close to PMP exam as any simulator could ever be. Their questions actually teach you how to think on the real exam not what to think which is what the real exam demands.</Text>< name>

I wanted to take this opportunity to thank Cornelius and the PM prepcast team for their help in providing a great program for getting me prepared to pass my PMP exam.  I passed on the first try today 5-13 and felt very comfortable while taking the test.  Particularly I appreciated the way the program dealt with individual topics and knowledge areas but also brought them together so you were able to understand the inter-relatedness of the processes as they ebb and flow through the project life cycle.  It is a lot of dry material, but they do a great job to keep it light and entertaining.  A great resource and a great value.
Thank you PM prepcast!  Another PM certified!<//text>

Prepcast has very good and detailed videos for PMP preparation.

But their simulator is out of the world, probably the best in the industry. In usage, it's as close to PMP exam as any simulator could ever be. Their questions actually teach you how to think on the real exam not what to think which is what the real exam demands.<//Review>

<review>PrepCast and the Exam Simulator is a MUST if you're preparing for the PMP Exam.

I read the PMBOK before purchasing PrepCast, then revisited the PMBOK during and after going through the PrepCast modules/Exam Simulator. It was like I didn't even read the PMBOK the first time!

I also used another book in my studies, but the PrepCast helped to bring on the information together. I don't think purchasing the add-on formula guide was worth it, but I purchased it at the time because I was struggling with the formulas. Just stuck with the modules, making note cards and basic review, and the formulas will sink in over time.

Don't think I would've passed without the Exam Simulator. Can't emphasize enough how helpful it was to use with the modules.<//review>< response>

<review>Greetings from Switzerland! I took yesterday the new pilot version of the PMP certification exam in Zürich, and although it was quite different, I must say the test simulator helped me very much to strengthen my knowledge! It also trained me well to be able to focus for 4 hours straight, no breaks! Because it is a pilot, I will have results in May 2020, however I feel pretty confident about it! :)< /review>< Pictures>

<user_name>Ricky Nichols</user_name><review>PrepCast is the best tool on the market to ensure you pass your PMP Exam on your first attempt!  The sample questions are spot on!! If you are really committed to achieving your PMP Certification, don't waist your time, money, and effort on anything less.  I conducted a self study, spent six months in preparation,  and used the PrepCast tools to help me score "Above Target" in all areas with 90 minutes left for review.  No joke,  I finished the exam in two and half hours, with only eight questions marked for review. The first twenty questions seemed almost verbatim from the sample questions, and my confidence level shot through the roof!!  If I can do it, so can you!!  Luck has nothing to do with it.  Prepare with the BEST, and the results will absolutely amaze you.<//review>< Pictures>

The PM PrepCast format and materials were key to my success in obtaining my PMP on my first attempt, without memorizing ITTOs. Cornelius Fletcher teaches you in a manner that makes it easy to understand and connect the dots, filling in any gap areas from your professional experience. I highly recommend the Project Management PrepCast.</text>

Buying the Exam Simulator was the best choice I did. I passed PMP on my first try. I used the PM PrepCast and the Exam Simulator. Both are excellent products, PM PrepCast helped understand PMBOK and provide real examples. Exam Simulator helped with time management as well as training the brain in how the exam questions would be. I would recommend these to anyone starting their journey.<//Text>

I recommend PM PrepCast training to individuals who are seeking to become a certified PMP. Cornelius Fichtner's online course is highly detailed and covers everything from A-Z. I also recommend his exam simulator to prepare for the exam; it is extremely beneficial and helps identify areas that you may need to study more in preparation for the actual test. I passed the exam on February 15, 2020 and this course was instrumental in helping me achieve my goal. Thank you Cornelius!<//Review>

Highly recommend!  The lessons are short and broken into sections of information that lends itself to consumption and absorption.  The course covers everything from the PMI Code of Ethics to tips to taking the test and of course, the PMBOK.  You can't go wrong with the Project Management PrepCast!< /Review>

<text>I have experienced only the exam simulator, but I strongly recommend this as part of your study plan. The questions are written in the same style as and the user interface offers a good simulation to the real exam. Why I chose PrepCast over other similar offers was due to the detailed explanations of the answers, not just the correct one, but each and every wrong one. More importantly, it provided exact references to the source material for the question. This allows you to quickly review the material and understand where you went wrong. One other feature which I used on a couple occasions was asking for feedback on exam questions. I received responses back within 24 hours to clarify my questions so I could better understand the correct answer. I compared against a few other exam simulators and they did not have these benefits. PrepCast also offers a limited money back guarantee and a free test, so there's minimal barrier to entry. I passed my exam on my first try with Above Target, and I was not sponsored or incentivized for my review.<//text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>{'time': 1558720891586, 'text': "Congratulations on passing the exam and thank you so much for highlighting many of the important features that our simulator offers.

So glad i invested in this software,
This simulation is so real you ll think you are doing the main exam. It helped me gain memory strength, learn time management, understood how to attack scenario questions and gain speed. The main exam was like the PrepCast simulation. I literally felt like I was doing another PrepCast simulation.
For test takers, this is a must have. You would thank God you bought PrepCast.  After doing all your reading, PrepCast simulation would boast your confidence once you start taking the test. The explanations on the answers after each timed simulation is a huge addition.<//review>

I consider the simulator as having contributed to my passing the exam on my 1st attempt. I completed 1400 questions which gave me the confidence that I was ready for the exam. The domain analysis offered by the simulator also directed my focus on specific management areas that i was struggling with.<//text>

The Project Management PrepCast is a great resource to learn the PMP materials.  Cornelius does a great job in each of the lessons to explain the subject matter!  Highly recommend PrepCast.< /Text>

Excellent preparation for the PMP exam. Questions are very similar in length and difficulty to actual exam questions. Explanations of correct / incorrect answers are very helpful in increasing understanding of topics. Easy to run through questions from your phone. Highly recommend.<//review>

<Text>Prepcast definitely opened my eyes and helped me tremendously on how to take the PMP exam. Not all questions are exactly like the exam; however, you will a few just like the exam. This test is KEY to see what you know and what you don't know. I've never seen a test emulator that gives you detailed explanation on what's right and what's wrong. I can't believe someone would put so much effort in to a process for people that want to smash this exam... And this is it. Well done, Cornelius. This product is one of a kind.< /Text>< pics>

I have recently passed the PMP exam and the PM PrepCast - together with the Exam Simulator - has been my best friend throughout this journey. I loved the training lessons and the way the videos and the whole suite were organized. Concepts were clearly explained, I could easily follow along on the PMBOK Guide, and I appreciate that some topics that are not part of the PMBOK Guide while being included in the exam contents outline were discussed and fully explained in the video lessons.
For my preparation I watched all the lessons, including the optional ones, as I found them useful too, to gain further insight on specific topics.

I have tried other courses in the past, before finding the PM PrepCast, and comparing the two experiences I definitely recommend the latter: I liked the fact that it elaborates on the main concepts and provides justification, helping you deeply understanding the processes and their relationships - as opposed to just reproducing the very same concepts presented in the PMBOK Guide, with no relevant insights, basically summarizing each chapter of the PMBOK. At least this was my experience and I found the PM PrepCast fully matching my studying and learning approach.
An added value for me was the possibility to watch them as podcasts, so that I could take advantage of my time commuting every day to study for the PMP exam.
Also, I appreciated it is truly up to date and aligned to the 6th edition of the PMBOK Guide - I would not give it for granted!

The PM PrepCast Exam Simulator was also a pillar in my preparation! I find the wording and the way the scenarios are described very close to those you would find in the real exam. You have 7 full exams, plus one entirely dedicated to ITTOs - which I found extremely useful to improve my knowledge and understanding on this often struggling topic. If you have 4 full hours available, I would recommend to take one of the exams, just to get used to the way you would approach the real exam. But the timed quizzes mode is also helpful, because it helps you practice for the exam based on the time available. Extremely useful are the explanations provided, which truly helped me understand not only the reason why the right answer was the right answer, but also why the other options were wrong.<//Text>

Best PMP exam preparation available! The exam simulator is a must-use tool to adequate preparation. The questions asked truly force you to understand end to end processes, and the answer explanations drill in the knowledge. You could pass using this tool alone, provided you go through every single question you answer incorrectly. HIGHLY recommend!</text>

I started this journey in June 2019. I registered for the exam and started to study. I had scheduled the exam in October 2019. I was reading Mike Griffiths book & listening to Cornelius Fichtner, PMP, CSM Podcast [which was very helpful during my PMP in 2009].
Unfortunately, a tragedy struck in the family and I could not keep my exam date. When I informed the Project Management Institute about the situation, they waved my rescheduling fees.
The Agile PrepCast™ also extended my subscription for the podcast without any charges. I rescheduled my exam in March 2020, but the second time an unfortunate event happened in the family and I had to reschedule the exam. Finally yesterday I appeared for the exam and passed.

I am immensely grateful to the PM community, @PM-Prepcast, Cornelius Fichtner, PMP, CSM, Project Management Institute & Mike Griffiths book.

<review>PM Prepcast is professionally driven and managed by one and only Cornelius Fichtner!!!
I passed my PMP back in 2017 with flying colors ( 4 P's and 1 MP) through PM Prepcast module and its Exam Simulator. worth of every penny spent on it. well designed and supported by its back end team while you are guided and mentored by Mr.CF.

I liked its interface and easy to use tools all throughout the preparation. Now, I am back for my PMP Renewal course (PDU's). I have  successfully completed it and earned my PDU's .

My appeal to every PMP certification dreamer! just enroll with PM Prepcast and surrender yourself to Cornelius Fichtner classes.
You will not be disappointed!!!

Thanks again PM Prepcast and Mr.Cornelius.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Buying the PM Exam Simulator was the best decision I took. Thanks to the PrepCast Exam Simulator, I passed my PMP certification with excellent results. This was my second attempt (note that the first attempt, I had not invested in any simulator) and even though I knew the PMP material, it was because I used the PM PrepCast simulator that I could experience questions similar to those from the PMP exam. Thank you for this great tool. Thank you PM PrepCast team!< /review>

Update: Purchased the PMI-ACP, and just passed that exam today. Anyone looking to pass the PMP or ACP exams should absolutely purchase with confidence.

I just passed the PMP after not passing the first time. These questions are good, but the true value is not the questions it is the detailed answers for both why the answer is right and why all the other answers are wrong. This helped me realize the way the questions would be broken down when I went to sit for the exam today. Strong suggestion use the right click and right click all the wrong answers for each questions as they will build up your knowledge if you can keep eliminating all the wrong answers on these practice tests that means you are ready to sit or at least that is what worked for me. Good luck to everyone else trying to obtain their PMP.

I subscribed PrepCast  - PMP simulation on Dec.2019 i would like to take the opportunity to thank and show my appreciation to the PrepCast team , starting from the ease of subscription,the support of the help disk and the simulation exams which i found it so close to the real exam, im telling this because i had others simulations and weren't not helpful.
First i started with the Learning Quiz's after each knowledge area i studied , then i took the Timed full Mock exams , and reviewing the wrong answer and study them i felt that improved my studying and went to the real exam with confidence , Thanks to God and thanks for PrepCast team i passed the exam on 27th Jan.2020 with result ( Above Target ) in All Domains.<//Text>

<Name>nikhil kulkarni</Name><Pics>None<//Pics><text>PASSED MY PMP in 2nd attempt. The review is bit longer, but I'm sure it'll definitely add value.
1st attempt:
Did my first attempt in last year in the month of May. While preparing for the exam, I came across too many study materials such as Kim heldman, Andy Crow, Rita Mulchay, some online material, PMBOK and study material from my local PMI chapter, etc.. After checking for almost a month, decided to follow Rita, Local chapter study material and PMBOK.
Mistakes that I did:
1. Scheduled the exam even before I started the preparation. Became too optimistic about my studies, hence not even rescheduled it.
2. Wasted time in selecting the right study material.
3. Took the online free simulator just a day before my exam. (Not PM Prepcast)
4. Studied very hard and not smart.
5. Didn't practiced for numerical at all. (what a fool I was)

Result was clear, I failed miserably. Couldn't able to understand the questions in the exam, answering them was a way too far. Took almost 4-5 months to recover from this frustration, as I had never tasted the failure before.

2nd attempt:
I wasn't sure if I'll be attempting again for the exam. But PMI kept reminding me about my remaining two attempts, in one of the mails they even reminded me that now I've left with only 3months to take the 2nd attempt otherwise I'll have to reapply, as my one year application validity was getting expired in 3 months. So, one fine day, I took the deep breath, closed my eyes and convince myself to apply for 2nd attempt. This time I was assigned for a project which allowed me very less time for any of my personal works. So, somehow I could manage to get only 1hr in the morning and 1 hr in the evening. Followed below steps to make things right this time-
1. Written down the lessons learned from my previous exam experience.
2. Took the PMPrepcast lessons package, and watched the lessons avg 2hrs per day. (Kept my choice clear)
3. After watching the prepcast lessons, reviewed the local chapter study material and checked PMBOK only for glossary. (only reviewed in brief and not in detail)
4. Though all lessons from prepcast were not completed, I stopped checking any of the material and started with the exam simulator almost 10 days prior to exam.
5. Since I could get almost 2hrs a day, I was unable to take full exams. So, I started with time & learning quizzes. Did all types of quizzes from 10 questions to 100 questions. The results were ranging from 53% to 90%. Took only one full exam and scored 80%.
6. AND THAT WAS THE BANG!!! The learning from these questions were amazing. I could able to understand the thought process behind every question that is being asked.
7. I checked the explanation of all the wrong questions and then could able to relate what is being asked. This helped me gain confidence. I was so happy that at least now I was able to understand the questions and could able to figure out the best possible answer.
8. Prepared for all the possible numerical and memorized the necessary formulas. Solved avg 5 numerical per formula. (What an easy task it was!)
9. After taking almost 500 questions from the simulator, now I was confident enough that I can pass the exam with at least T's in all areas.

And this worked, the actual exam questions seemed very easy and I finished my exam with almost 20min left. And not even T but secured AT in all areas.
Thanks to PM Prepcast.
Last word. EXAM SIMULATOR IS A MUST. DON'T MISS IT AT ANY COST.</text><time>1585634798291</time><gmap_id>0x80dcdaea30496c3b:0x6197bf09e1400df8< /gmap_id>< Resp>

The PM Exam Simulator questions are well-written tied to their source in the PMBOK guide. The test results help me to understand my weak areas and to focus on them. After a few 200 question exam simulations and additional practice question sets I felt confident and passed on my first attempt.<//text>

I am considering all the resourced comin from you. The simulation study helps me a lot to understand the concepts. Thank you very much. I'm continuing my study to ensure I can pass the examination.

By the way I learned that the eligibility of PMP exam has been extended up to December 30, 2020. My eligibility expires on 14 April 2020. In this case my eligibility will also be extended to December 30, 2020. It will be very good development so that I can have more time time to study. I will request for my examination within the month of December. Please I need from you an advice and clarification so that I can program myself for the examination .

<user_name>Emily Fernandez</user_name><text>I could NOT have passed the PMP exam this past Friday, March 6th without the Prepcast.  With the convenience of the podcast, I  listened to all of the knowledge areas while computing to and from work several times. I took the tests at the end of each section and I believe what really assisted me the most was the Exam Simulator!  I took all Seven Exam Simulators and always researched the.answers that I got wrong and I even investigated why the other possible answers were not correct.  I studied the material for at least Three hours a day. On the day of my exam I got up very early and reviewed all of the Prepcast tests and I felt confident going to the exam site.  I was extremely happy when I saw “ Congratulations “ at the end of the exam but a few minutes later I received my test results and I was shocked to see that I achieved Above Target in Four Knowledge Areas.  Thank you Prepcast!  I intend on obtaining the required PDU credits from Prepcast as well.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>{'time': 1584652932093, 'text': 'Helping our students prepare with questions similar to those on the actual exam is common feedback that we hear.

I want to express my sincere gratitude for your training program. I had taken and failed the test and was ready to give up, but decided to try your program. I listened to each of the videos and took the quiz and simulator tests.
Excellent material!!!

Thanks so much

<Text>I was not lucky as I studied hard but I failed for the second time. I passed CAPM in my first attempt a few years ago. After 3 months of hard study for the first time from another online course, I failed on the September exam. I came across PreCast with great review and I bought courses and simulators. The course was similar to one I had and I returned the training course but kept simulator and it was great. Anyway, I almost covered 1400 tests within 50 to 90 percent score and study almost 3 months none stop sometimes 7 hours a day. But I don't know what happened and I don’t blame anybody or any training system. I completely disappointed about myself and no ability to move forward<//Text>< Pictures>

<review>I duff my hat to Coach Cornelius and his team for contributing immensely to my success alas after failing the exam previously. Failing was part of the learning experience. Now i can tell which resource in the market can enable you crush the exam. And Coach Cornelius's prepcast, simulator and other resources are of this pedigree. Bravo Coach Conelius Fichtner and Team.

This PMP simulator is a fantastic resource! Thank you for creating such a wonderful study tool. I accessed the simulator 5 weeks before my exam date and utilised all test exams available. I found the real value of this simulator was (a) the quality of the questions which aligned closely with the exam questions and (b) the detailed explanations for why an answer was correct or incorrect. This really helped me to understand the subtlety of some of the more challenging topics (c) the availability of multiple full length exams with fresh questions. I passed the PMP exam with 5 AT on my first attempt (while 8 months pregnant!).</review>

Used PrepCast for my PMP Prep. The long, 200 question practice exams in the simulator were especially helpful. Allows one to practice focusing on 'PMP topics' for a long time and recommend going through each question afterwards to read the PrepCast analysis as to 'why' a question was right or wrong. One has to use the other elements to learn the material before but definitely recommend using the tests. I did 'fair to mediocre' on the multiple practice tests I took, but the 'why' knowledge helped me pass the PMP exam with 'Above Target' in all five knowledge areas. Definitely recommend!<//Text>

<Review>The questions on the simulator were even harder than the real questions on the PMP exam, consequently, I was able to pass all five domains with Above Target. My practice exams provided reviews of all the questions I got wrong, and I repeatedly took the test on the simulator, It became clear to me that I was scoring higher and higher with every exam. I was averaging 70,75,80 and 85 percent. I don't know how I would have performed on the real exam had I not had the simulator. Thanks for your help Cornelius and team.<//Review><time>1580871851620< /time><Pics>None< /Pics><userid>113784052489508654576<//userid>< rate>

<time>1581522340114</time><rating>5< /rating><Text>When I finally passed the PMP, I had two weeks left on my application, so it was do or die time,  I discovered that after studying all the process groups, all the knowledge areas, and going through the PMBOK - testing, and getting into "test-taking mode" is absolutely key to passing the PMP Exam.  This simulator is excellent because you can tailor the amount of questions and the subject areas to get into mode.  It also offers 9 or 10 full 200 question exams.  Most beneficial, however, is that this simulator provides answers that reference exact language in the PMBOK.  I only found one free online source that did that, but it wasn't as difficult as the PM PrepCast simulator.  I would recommend using this simulator along with buying paper test books like Andrew Ramdayal's PMP Exam Prep:  Over 600 practice questions and doing the chapter tests in Rita Mulcahy's book.  The simulator got me over the edge, no doubt.  I scored "Above Target" in 4 of the 5 process groups.< /Text>< Pics>

Excellent Preparation tool. I have cleared the PMP exam. The explanation given for correct answer is very elobarative and crystal clear. Good thing about this tool is clearly cover why the wrong answer as well which helps us to understand which one to choose as the best answer. I would recommend this tool if you want to clear the exams.<//text>

<Text>I studied for PMP using exclusively the Prepcast Materials, self paced tutorials and the exam Bank. I did a little research on the best materials for PMP, I quickly realized Prepcast is the best  bang for the bulk. I diligently followed the tutorials, I made notes, made very little use of the PMBOK I focused mainly on the lectures. After about a month of study, I applied for the exam. I got audited, I followed Fitchers advice and directions on the audit and cleared this in jutst 5 days. I set a day for the exam, before then I attempted 5 full exams from the Prepcast exam bank, my average was 73%. We for the exam, it felt like daja vu. I was not stressed, I understood the concepts, zero Memory dump. Finished with about fifteen minutes to spare. Result came and I have AT*5. This is my first attempt, Prepcast gave me both the knowledge and the certificate. I cannot recommend Prepcast enough.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>{'time': 1582302844279, 'text': 'Thank you so much for your wonderful feedback and recommendation.

Trust me the investment you make here and if you use it to full, and when you clear PMP you will be ever thankful  you bought this. If you are having any doubts just like I had whether to invest INR 10,000 rs on this exam simulator, remember this is not a gamble, you will not regret!!

The PM PrepCast was fundamental to get the PMP certification. In fact, the way it is structured, helps you to focus on all the main topics by providing you a lot of examples and the "why" behind the important statements. The PM PrepCast approach will catch your attention and you will be always focused on listening to Cornelius and understanding. The simulation exams are extremely useful to get prepared to the real exam as long as the ITTO exam. So thank PM PrepCast:  your approach and study plan is the winning one!<//text>

I searched for self-paced training to earn the required PDU's for the PMP certification.  I found Cornelius Fichtner and the PrepCast.  It looked like it had good reviews and the price was actually lower than I was anticipating.  I purchased the course and the exam-prep plus some other training offered in the bundle.

The course was perfect.  I listened in podcast mode on my way to and from work and any time I could and then I wen through the same material but watched it on my computer.  The slides were helpful to learn the concepts more in-depth.  I took notes so I could do a review later of the material I thought would be important.  In total I watched all of the courses atleast once, some topics twice and then I listened in podcast mode to all of them a few times.  (Also read the PMBOK through the course)

I passed the course exam and printed the course certificate and submitted my application to the PMI.  My application was accepted.  Then I get an email from Dan Ryan about a weekend bootcamp sort of training I signed up that and that was a quick review of the course.  This all helped me learn the material.

Then I started getting exam ready by taking all of the tests in Dan's course.  That helped be realize the areas I really needed to review. I took all of Dan's prep tests.  Once I passed those at a good rate.  I went back to the Exam prep that came with the PM PrepCast bundle and those tests were very helpful!  I took 2 full 4 hour exams and did well and then went through the formula course and related exam to make sure I knew that.  After passing 2 4-hour exams and a few 100 and 200 question exams I was ready to sign up for the real exam.

I should have signed up earlier as the available test times were about a 4 weeks away.  I was hoping to take the exam much earlier.  Then luckily I found a spot that was much earlier than I planned... Like 3 days away.  I took a leap of faith and signed up for that date.  (My advice is set a date earlier in your process.)  Anyway, I felt well prepared and did well I the exam.  I passed!< /review>

It helped me to understand how to read and answer the questions and was a good addition to my preparation and understanding. However, the difficulty level of PMP real exam was a bit more. If I had to put PM Prepcast and PMP on scale of Low, Mid and High Difficulty, i'll put PM Prepcast at Mid and real PMP exam at High Difficulty levels.< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<Review>Thank you to the Prepcast Team for the great PMP Exam simulator, after finishing the free trial, I purchased the full access version which allowed me to access 8 fantastic exams all of which had 200 questions, well structured answers with really good explanations to understand where you went wrong. One of the examination I have had access to included the ITTO's, this was very important to solidify my understanding and to find the gaps in my knowledge regarding the inputs, tools and techniques and outputs.

Through my experience and consistent studying I have successfully obtained my Project Management Professional PMP accreditation.

I humbly thank the Prepcast Team once again for their great simulator, technical support and efficiency.

All the best and luck for the future.

I can't say enough good things about your product.  I took 4 practice exams.  I scored between 72-78%.  I felt like I was in a good place before going in and I understood from your statistics I had a good chance of passing.  Not only did I pass but I was Above Target in every single area.  The simulator is a very accurate representation of the exam.  In fact, I think the simulator may be a little harder in some cases.  You have a great product and it was well worth the investment.< /text>

I worked hard to get my PMP certification (earned FIVE "AT" scores) and can say with extreme confidence, the "PM Exam Simulator" is THE BEST product to use for PMP certification!! It has an explanation for why a question choice was right or wrong, many times with explicit PMBOK 6th edition references (ex. page). Other simulators I tried had answers based on older PMBOK editions, which stood out as referring to "Human Resource Management" instead of "Resource Management." These simulators started to create confusion during my training. The PM Simulator also graded me by various areas, which let me work on areas of deficiencies. I also could decide the number of questions, the topic, and also to include ITTOs or not. The flashcards were helpful as well. I was told by another online PMI instructor the "Cornelius Simulator" (Cornelius Fichtner) was the best to use and it is.< /review>

When I started studying PMP, There were many options to choose from. After researching & reading feedbacks, I decided to go with PrepCast. Initially, I opted for 1-week free simulator & then I went with full access. The good thing about PrepCast is, you have the option to learn with & without time restrictions. Some pro/cons (not actually cons but I can see areas of improvements)
Pro:
1. 1600 questions are a lot.
2. Flexibility to choose from how to do study. Means time based, knowledge area-wise, Process groups wise etc.
3. Every question and/answers are precisely narrated.
4. The difficulty level of English or grammar or sentence structure is somewhat similar to the real exam.
5. Cool thing is, Reference given of PMBOK guide.

Cons (Not actually)
1. The orientation of PrepCast is somewhat not inline with the real exam. like,
a. In the real exam, you will have an in-built calculator (soft calculator).
b. The real exam has no option to highlight and/or straight-out the wrong answers whereas PrepCast has.
c. Real Exam show time in minutes in descending order (240, 239, 238) whereas PrepCast shows in HH: MM format. Whereas in PrepCast it's easy. It difficult in the real exam to correlate the time with questions remaining. So just want to have consistency with the real exam.
2. I found PrepCast somewhat easier than the Real Exam.
3. Keep in mind, there is no feature in the real exam to zoom in/out the page whereas you can do the same in PrepCast Simulator (using Cntl+/-Mouse cursor).

Overall, I am happy with PrepCast for my PMP preparations. This has helped me to prepare & made ready for the real exam. I recommend buying PrepCast & complete at least 6-7 PMP Exam from the simulator.

Not to forget: Tips received in the emails (new sellers) were helpful. It's good to have them for a quick study.

Thank You PrepCast.<//Review>

I had fun during the exam knowing that i was going to pass because i had practiced with questions that seems tougher than the exam questions. Honestly, if you can go through all the questions and understand why the wrong questions are wrong. You will find the exam easy. You will know the direction of the question by the time you are reading the options. I was surprised to have finished 200 questions 30 mins earlier, and had time to relax.
Oh! Before all these stories, i should have announced that i passed just in one sitting in a very busy world.

I purchased the PM prepcast and used it. First of all, I feel that it is little costly, secondly I feel that 3 month duration access is not enough to clear the PMP exam for a working professional as we don't have enough time to practice. I appreciate if they can extend the duration.<//Review>

"Big thank to  PM PrepCast Simulator!", I passed PMP exam today on my first try.
The simulator is very close to real exam experience, on type of problem and ask for the best fit solution. Starting to read the questions on the real exam, and feeling it is no big surprise, took a lot of the initial stress away.
Going through bad and good answer's reasoning and even catching where that detail is in the latest PMBOK made the whole difference in my preparation for the real exam! Educative, useful and fun!
Thank you, Cornelius and PM PrepCast team, you have been the most helpful with your tool and support!< /Text>

< review>
I passed the PMP exam on my first attempt with an Above Target rating.  The PrepCast was a valuable tool.  I reviewed several courses and chose this - and was very satisfied.   I am in my 40s and wanted something professional and straightforward.  I don't need any extra "stories" to convey the learning.  Cornelius has a great voice, very clear, well articulated and with the right of emphasis without being overkill.  And just a peppering of humor.  It was very easy to listen to and retain.  The exam simulator is great.  But I didn't notice the option for the timed/learning quizzes right away - that was fantastic.  You don't always have the time for the full 4 hours, so sneaking in smaller, or more focused quizzes was very helpful.  You will still need to poor over the book, which I did after the going through the lessons (my personal choice), but I did go back and re-listen to a few lessons that I wan'ted to reinforce.  Well worth the money!< /review>

After failing on my first attempt I decided to buy the premium package from PM PrepCast and let me tell you it has been worth every penny. I watched the videos 2-3 hrs daily taking notes and studying on the topics that I was failing the mark.
After the simulations I finally felt ready for the exam and I was not nervous anymore. I was happy afer seeing the PASS on my certificate. Thanks PM PrepCast Team!
It was an awesome ride Cornelius.<//Review>

I had purchased the PMP exam simulator and had been using it as a Practice for the real test. To my surprise, I uncovered many gaps which I did not realize I had until I took the first test. I would like to thank you for this comprehensive set of questions which extensively covers all the key areas of the exam content. Practicing these questions multiple times gave me the confidence needed and I managed  to clear the exam in my very first attempt. I would definitely recommend this PMP exam simulator to all PMP aspirants!< /text>

Passed yesterday my exam. This will be the best asset you have for the exam. My program was, I read two times Rita Mulcahy 6th edition, after that I started doing quizzes on the simulator. 10 to 30 questions. I started with grades around 55-65%, after 2-3 weeks I was already getting around 75-80% and at the last month I was getting around 90-100% in quizzes of 10 to 20 questions. I did the 7 mockup exams in the last month. I took between 82-88%, having an average of 86%. I studied for 3 months. On the last week for exam I took the days off in order to review all the processes.

In total I did around 215 quizzes replying to 5250 questions, in total it was around 88 hours of training on the exam program.

For the processes I was getting on the first answers around 60% to 68%. At the end, for all my answers I was getting around 75% to 81%.

Practices and reviewing the wrong answers, this will make you build confidence for the exam.

Good luck for you all!

PS: passed on my second time doing the exam, and I didn't used this tool on the first one.

Regards,
Daniel</review>

<Text>If you are serious, Cornelius will get you there. Yes, it counts for the 35 hours needed, yes, sometimes I wanted to choke him to shut up (= tons of high quality video lessons), but do get the Exam Simulator, too. I believe, if you don't cheat, and pass those exams, you'll pass the real exam too. Just be serious and work hard. Yes, you have responsibility too. But you want that as PM, right?</Text>< name>

< Review>
The prepcast does provide the required training hours for the PMP exam.
Between the videos and the free exams, along with the PMBOK Guide and another (more visual) book, I was able to pass the exam first time.
I'd say the prepcast did its job and compared to some bootcamps, it's worth every cent I spent!<//Review>

My friend used this site for exam practice and told me to do the same, I thought it was to expensive and then failed my first try. Second time around I paid the money and today I am a PMP the tests made a world of difference. I learned more from them then the pimbok and Rita's book combined<//Review>

<review>One of the best PMP prep courses out there for the experienced or busy project manager! I am in the military, a company commander, and decided to obtain my PMP. I failed the first attempt then conducted my research to find the best prep material while still being able to perform my duties. The PM Prepcast was not only the most suitable course of action but I also passed the PMP exam with "Above Target" in all process groups!< /review>< gmapID>

Compared to Andy Crowe’s and Rita Mulcahy’s simulators, the PM Exam Simulator consistently utilized PMBOK-specific language and concepts. It also exceeded in explaining EACH answer in depth (A, B, C, and D) and why it was right or wrong, in addition to a general paragraph about the question. I took one 40 question quiz 4 days a week (Monday–Thursday, per weekly knowledge area) and 8 full simulated exams (one each Friday). Best deal on the market, hands down!< /text>

I did smaller timed quizzes and learning quizzes that I could do by knowledge area or process group.

<Review>Recommended !

In real exam you will see same type of question as same as in simulator or even easier than simulator. Specific one point I want to appreciate here that ...this is one of the best simulator which gives justification of each option along with example like why it is correct choice and why it is wrong choice, So it clears understanding and make your mind to solve question in right way.

Practicing tough questions from this simulator helped me to score above target.

I recommend to do practice until you get 85 % in all 7 practice exams of simulator .

I appreciate PrepCast team for making such useful simulator and time to time feedback for queries.

Credit of passing PMP exam goes to,
- RITA BOOK
- Prepcast Simulator
- PMBOK
- Saket Bansal- Youtube Videos
- Varun Anand- Youtube Videos

Thanks again !

The PM exam simulator helped me pass the PMP exam. I purchased it after I studied the Rita guide for PMP exam and I completed over 800 questions. The format of the website is fantastic and it allows creating customizable exams, learning and timed modes. The explanation of the logic behind the correct and incorrect answers is very thorough and easy to follow. After few exams, you can choose to focus on one knowledge area or project phase and solve all the related questions to that area until you are very comfortable. I passed my exam from the 1st time and with above target result! I have been recommending it for all my colleagues who plan to take the exam.<//Text>

<Review>It all started back in January 2019 when our organization in Nairobi,Kenya needed a Certified Project Manager to achieve its strategic objective.

After months of searching for a suitable PMP trainer,i came across the Pm Prep cast  from OSP Int LLC. I have to say this is the best thing that i ever came across.I followed the study plan,watched all the videos,did all the quizzes and finally,the Pm Simulator ...I found the questions on the simulator a lot like the real PMP exam.

I highly recommend the Pm Prep Cast to anyone who is seriously thinking about getting Certified,its a stellar...Go ahead ,try it..

All the best and as Cornelius loves to say...

Until Next time ....</Review>< pictures>

I'd highly recommend this to anyone looking to complete the 35 contact hour requirement which is mandatory for the PMP exam.
Lesson content is well structured and lucid, making for a fun learning experience.
The podcast feature makes lessons accessible via mobile phone which is a huge time saver, since you can continue watching lessons while on the go.
I especially appreciated the "speed adjustment" feature since I am used to a faster pace of speech than the natural pace of the tutorial. I loved the fact that I could increase the speed to a level I found comfortable, and which kept me mentally engaged.

*Edit*
Updated on 12th October 2019 (a few weeks after my original review)
I used the Exam Simulator as well, once I had completed studying the PMBOK guide. I found it very useful. Each answer had a detailed explanation, and the "Live Feedback" feature is particularly useful to get additional clarifications or to provide feedback on any specific questions in the practice exams.
Definitely would recommend!</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>{'time': 1564943898788, 'text': "Hello Anusha. I'm typing this response at twice my normal speed. Thank you so much for your kind words and best of luck on the exam."}</resp><userid>112038344102378401346<//userid>< rate>

It helped me understand the structure of exam questions. After each mock exam, the simulator provided in-depth explanations of the correct and incorrect answers. It also provided score stats so I could better understand how prepared I was to take the PMP exam. I gained a deeper level of PMBOK knowledge using PM PrepCast and was able to earn my PMP at first attempt. A valuable tool to use during your exam preparation!</Text><rating>5</rating>< user>

I have no words to thank PrepCast for the help in getting through PMP.
I used it both for learning and checking my preparation.
I am sure no matter what, without PrepCast I dont think I would have cleared my PMP. It makes us think right direction and right way in answering the question , which is more important.

Thanks to the team for building an amazing tool.<//text>

I tried a couple of websites and this was the best. I listened to all the Prepcast lessons and did all the quizzes and tests. I supplemented it with another site called PM Training because their tests were only 50 questions and I could easily to them during the week. I thought the prepcast tests were harder than the real test- IMHO.<//Text>

I opted for the PM PrepCast from a co-worker who used it since I wanted an affordable and relatively quick way to study for the PMP exam.  Having a small child at home, it just wasn't ideal for me to take an in-person class.  I thought the PM PrepCast did a great job of framing the material and walking the viewer through it in a clear, logical fashion.  The program also manages to keep one's interest through pretty dry material.  I ended up purchasing the company's online flash cards and exam simulator, as well, and I passed the exam on my first try.  I recommend their products if you are able to motivate yourself and do a self-study course.< /text>

I have successfully passed the PMP Examination and I would like to thank PM PrepCast and the team for support and guidance. It took me about 8 months for the preparation with my busy working schedule. I have used PM Prepcast exam simulator together with other online practice questions. Of all, I find that PM Prepcast really helped me to prepare well for the examination. Some question patterns are quite similar to the simulator. It's really worth getting the simulator. PMI has a pool of questions and I believe the questions are not repeated. You can expected combinations of hard and some easy questions.Most of the questions are situational based and requires the solution to be in line with PMI values and standards.Some of the questions were theoretical and also had some calculations. The solution or answers are not only based on personal logic or what the experience suggests but also refers to the PMI’s standards. Time management for answering each question is crucial and should be managed well. Once again, thank you PM Prepcast!< /review>

<username>Harry Elston<//username><time>1570277162527</time><Rating>4<//Rating><review>In terms of quality, the PM-Prepcast and the associated exam simulator are excellent tools for preparing for the PMP exam.  I do not believe that they are the only tools one should use, however.  You must have the PMBOK Guide as well; and my learning style also required a good workbook to accompany the Prepcast to make the material more real for me.  The exam simulator was exactly on target with the style and types of questions found on the PMP exam.

I used the computer-based LMS system almost exclusively.  I tried the podcast version a number of times  using Andriod-based podcast apps but always found them frustratingly clunky and difficult to manage.  Perhaps it was because of the apps or my unfamiliarity with the interface, but I essentially gave up after some time and resorted back to the desktop/laptop version.

All in all, the PM-PrepCast can be an essential tool for your preparation for the PMP exam.  I strongly recommend it.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Customer service was always prompt to respond to emails, there is a live feedback feature as well that enables you address individual areas of weaknesses.

Pm-precast simulator is an excellent simulator package!

The best feature about simulator is - detailed explanation of all the correct and incorrect options explaining why the particular answer is correct and other options are incorrect. This helps you to think ‘PMI way’ and this comes very handy during actual exam.

Another excellent feature (which I used quite a lot) is ‘Live Feedback’ where you can post your comments/questions/queries regarding the answered questions and options. You get a detailed reply usually within 24 hours explaining why a correct option is correct and why others are incorrect.

The questions are up to date w.r.t PMBOK6 version. The simulator questions resemble actual exam questions. The user interface is good and user friendly. With strikeout feature you can eliminate the wrong answers and visualize and choose between remaining options.

However I would suggest adding highlight feature (just like actual exam) to highlight important keywords / cues in the question.< /Text>

<review>I passed my PMP with "Above target" in every sigle process group.
That's amazing! I had been using PMP simulator for 3 months now every day on my way to work.
The PMP simulator covers all the topic you have to master befor going to the exam and that day I was flyng on the questions, I was in the topic and very confident.
My experience:
- Study PmBok Guide, make sur your understand the concept and how ITTOs flow
- Make sure the know most of the Tools ans techniques
- Then buy the PMP Similator from and take the exam (Setup a number of questions and choose one process group until you master all) after you can take all process group
- Read all the answers and explanation
***That's how I got above target in each Process group***

Good luck!

Thanks Cornelius!</review>< Pics>

PM Precast is by far one of the best studying tools for your PMP. The lessons are informative but most of all their exam Prep (Exam simulator) is by far the best. I don't think i could have passed without doing it. It is probably the closest to the real exam. Highly recommend this program< /Review>

I would like t share my experience with PrepCast. This program helped me a lot for my PMP exam preparation. I have gone through all the PMP exam test that are available within PrepCast.The questions are very realistic and it help to understand the exam format. It help your brain to be accustomed to the format of the exam. Just go through the questions, try to answer correctly as much as you can from the first attempt. Then go through your incorrect answer one by one, read the explanations. The answers are very detailed and help a lot to understand . Even the references to the PMbook pages helps to go the sources of the information.I have given my test yesterday and my results are above the target which is tremendous accomplishment.
Thanks PrepCast team for such a great opportunity that they give the students to increase they chance for successful results.<//text>

I am able to complete the 3 hours exam within 1.5hours with Above Target in 11 sections and Target score in 2 sections.
I give credit to the CAPM exam simulator, it helped me a lot with time management, lateral thinking and confidence to approach the exam.
I strongly recommend PMPrepcast as this is the best institution out there for aspirants who are preparing for PMP and CAPM and PMI certification
I will be taking my PMP exam shortly and I will use the PMP exam simulator of PMPrepcast for my exam preparation.
Highly recommended it.
Thank you so much team
I am looking forward to continue my journey with the PMPrepcast team

I used the PMP Prepcast to study for the PMP.  I first took the exam in November of 2018 and failed.  I mainly used the PMBOK guide and a Linkedin course for study material.  For my 2nd attempt at passing the PMP I signed up for the Prepcast and it made a huge difference.  I made a schedule of how many videos I needed to watch each week to stay on track and completed all the quizzes.  I also had the exam simulator and formula guide.  I failed most quizzes and every single practice exam that I took, but I did feel very prepared.  Even though I was failing all practice exams, I was relaxed and confident on the day of the exam.  As I got about half way through, I felt I was doing much better on the exam than I had on the practice ones.  I would have never passed without the guidance of the videos.  Cornelius does an excellent job of providing real world examples.</Text>

Project management Precast is very good material all inclusive to become a    knowledgeable project Manager and to pass PMP examination, most especially their Mock PMP exam simulator is properly tailored just like your real exam, if you passed their mock PMP ,there is high chance of you passing your PMP exam. I used the material to passed my PMP examination.< /Review>

Each of us has different way of learning. I failed once PMP several months ago. Since that day I studied again PM book about 4 times with the help of another book, I did about 1000 tests on another platform that I was already registered. But what really improved my knowledge, my preparation to face those 4 hours of 200 questions was the PMP Exam Simulator. I began to use this platform performing 3 out of 8 exams simulations, I passed them all three times, score about 73%. The remaining tests I used the learning way because I wanted to have immediate feedback, understand consciously at my rhythm how to improve. This simulator made the difference to me. I passed PMP exam above target, few weeks ago. Thanks a lot< /text>

<review>I had been studying the PMBOK and using  a variety of methods to aid in prepping me to write my PMP exam,  which I kept postponing because my confidence escaped me.  I purchased the PM Exam Simulator and began going through experiencing a 4 hour exam and realizing quickly where my gaps lay.  Using the simulator and understanding how the questions would be presented really helped me to address the gaps quickly, build my confidence and lead me to a successful exam result.   I wrote and passed my PMP on May 1st.  Thank you - definitely recommend to aspiring PMs striving for their professional accreditation.</review>< Pics>

<Text>I passed the PMP Exam for the first. Thanks to PM Precast exam preparation and the simulator. I was able to start on my own and the material was so easy to follow and explained the concepts clearly. Woow please get the Exam Simulator from PM Precast. The simulator prepared me very well to know how to find the best answer to the question. The last week before the exam, in fact I booked my exam a week before, yep, I took a gamble but because I trusted the Exam Sim, I never worried. I then focused on exam sim, I did it 4 times in that week from Saturday to Thursday and then I reviewed my answers.  Had the exam on Friday that week. Reviewing the Answers helped me to understand the material better. I am now going for PMI-ACP again through PM Precast. I really recommend anyone who wanna get PMP certified to get the PM Precast material and the Exam SIM.< /Text>< rate>

< Review>
The Agile PrepCast and Exam Simulator were the perfect combination of study products and made me perfectly prepared for the PMI-ACP certification exam. The practice exam questions in the Simulator were formed exactly like the real ones and provided great explanation about not only why the correct answer was it but also why the other options were not correct. Highly recommend OSP International's products to anyone studying for the PMP (I used them for that too) or the PMI-ACP exam.< /Review>

I was able to complete about 65% of the questions before my actual exam.  Using these test questions, my PMBOK guide and an online course, I was able to pass my exam with above target results in all categories!  Great questions within the test bank to get you thinking and learning all of the terms, inputs, outputs, and math requires to successfully pass the exam.<//Text>

PreCast exam simulator has helped a lot in my exam, this is the only question bank that i practiced for PMP, it is designed so well that you may not need anything else.
Based on your needs - time wise/ domain or knowledge area wise, you have all the options.
The quality of question and the explanations of wrong or correct answers, both were equally important to understand and clear your doubts.

All good. Great support pre sale and during product activation. If you're doing the whole PMP-exam journey on your own this will make it less lonely, as any frustrations in learing elicited by the questions can be sorted out by the Prepcast team. Really gets your mind into thinking the PMI way which is what a major part of the exam is all about. Good luck!<//review>

The Project Management Prepcast and the PMI-ACP Simulator resources  by Cornelius Fitchner are more of a discovery to me.. l Combined these with Mike Griffits prep book on ACP and these resources delivered my PMI-ACP qualification success. The key success factor for passing the ACP exam is access to quality materials and discipline of efforts. Been an Agile practitioner in a Technology environment, l find these materials  deep, easy to apply and well-focused on the 'spirit of Agile'. I highly recommend  these for candidates who want to pass the highly regarded PMI-ACP qualification. My appreciation goes to these great authors -Cornelius and Mike G.<//review>

The PM Prep Cast and PMP Exam Simulator were extremely useful for the preparation to my PMP exam. The Simulator allowed me to practice different types of questions in test and exam mode, discover and improve the gap areas.The PM Prep Cast provided a great explanation and insight on the concepts that are mentioned but not explicitly explained  in the PMBOK. Great tools, that are absolutely “must have” to get you fully prepared for the real exam and, yes, I’ve passed my exam from the first time! Recommend!<//review>

Why  waste time.
After four prep tests and multiple quizzes, I went in to my PMP Exam and passed on the first try and was well into the "Above Target" range for overall performance.  PM PrepCast's PMP Exam Simulator is the best.<//Text>

The PMP Exam Simulator by Cornelius and team is the final exam that sums up your readiness to take the exam. It is undoubtedly the best simulator out there for your PMP exam preparation and I encourage you to try it too.
I have purchased the PM Prepcast Elite, underwent the study program and passed the exam in mid-April. Best of all, the things that you learn not only stays but also, it grows with you. Until next time...<//Text>

PM Prepcast was a great study aide for me while preparing for my PMP certification exam.

The simulator questions were in line with the wording/difficulty that the actual exam presented.  In addition, the simulator questions had very thorough answers explaining each answer option and why it was either correct or incorrect.

I am glad I found this resource from the beginning as it was critical for me in passing the PMP certification on my first attempt (and I am a really horrible test taker), so PM Prepcast prepared me well.< /Text>

I started this journey about a year ago with very little business acumen even though I had been leading projects for years. Yesterday I passed the PMP exam for certification, my second attempt.

I wish I would have invested in PrepCast first. Prior to my first attempt, I started with reading the PMBOK and then I entered into an online course through a local university. It was nothing like PrepCast. It was 99.99% reading on your own with no audio or video...not the way I learn. After that first certification attempt I gave myself a month off. I then turned to PrepCast. I heard a number of people that passed the exam on first attempt when using the program.

At the beginning of each week I committed myself to completing a certain number of videos and or time based on my work/life schedule. I would at times allow myself a day off. I also purchased the test simulator. I completed most of the simulator through the learning format, not timed. Then, once I finished all test questions once, I took exams of only questions I answered incorrectly. Marking the wrong questions to correct answer if answered wrong again-taking advice from others not to review wrong answers multiple times. My test scores on first attempts were around 75%. Test scores were consistent and I had done all that I could studying and reviewing. I was ready. It took approximately a month to complete the videos and a month of test simulate.

Suggestions, in no particular order:

-invest time in support- network,
-the application completion takes a lot of time - before opening application, gather details, prepare your 500 word descriptions of projects and review details/give heads up to your contacts on application,
-brain dump formulas at start of exam even if you think you know it,
-make a firm commitment to study time,
-discuss extreme test anxiety with your doctor and PMI,
-do not memorize ITTOs - understand why such and such is an ITTO,
-understand that what needs to be done next for an iterative process is not necessarily in the flow of the process chart,
-spend time on understanding the change management process,
-there are number of ways that you can graphically see a critical path, free float or total float question, be prepared,
-success in this process will need to be achieved in your own manner, lessons learned are not the Bible,
-treat your preparation, test day and entire process like the project manager you are!</Text>

<text>I recently passed my PMP and I can honestly say this tool is probably THE best tool to use to prepare you for the exam. I would recommend a three-pong attack, read the PMBOK at least twice, buy a video course, and an absolute must - is THIS exam prep course - just the full mock up exams are worth it alone. The questions are close or similar to the real exam and  I'm positive, if it were not for taking these exams/quizzes for 2 months straight, that I would not have passed for a second time.<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

<review>Fantastic learning platform. The PMP PrepCast stands out from other courses as a highly reliable in preparation.
Simulator questions tie to real exam. The most awesome is outcome result from simulator. We can get information which answer is correct but as well explanation why other answers are incorrect. And this one helps the most and give an idea how to tackle the questions.
However platform is not only simulator, the video lessons are pleasant to listen, voice tone, timing speaking are recorded very professionally. It makes listening very enjoyable.
The PMP course preparation helped me a lot to pass my PMP exam. I can recommend PMP PrepCast to everyone who are preparing for PMP exam.<//review>< Name>

It greatly enhanced my chances to pass the exam in first attempt..
I would say the real exam was bit easier than some of the practice questions on Prepcast. If you care,  My statistics of average score for correct answers on first attempt was about 77% on prepcast and on the real exam i managed to hit Above Target score..  So don't get discouraged if you are not doing that good on Prepcast. You may do better in the real exam.

Thank you Prepcast team for putting together a wonderful Exam Simulator for the community..< /Text>

<text>I have passed the PMP exam on April 10th, with overall Above Target result (4 KA Above Target, 1 KA "Closing" in Below Target). The exam was very mind demanding regarding the time scope, you don´t have enough time to think deeply each answer so you have to chose the option very quickly. There were 4/5 EVM very basic questions, and all of them uses the same sample so you don't have to recalculate all basic values (EV, CV, SV, etc.) again. The was one easy schedule question, and roughly 1/3 questions are straight forward, 1/3 situational but easy ones and another 1/3 that you never will know if you answered well or not!! When doing Prep Cast exam tests, I tried to write down the 10 KA and 44 Process in the very first minutes of the test, but it takes more than 10 minutes and that will be precious time for answer all the questions. Based on my experience, I recommend to avoid this and only memorize the 5 Process Groups, 10 KA and all the process (most of them are repetitive) but don't waste time writing down them. What I think is more important is to write down the formulas, you can do it in a couple of minutes and it is very helpful when you are in a rush and you don't want to waste time remembering every time you need them and are prone to make mistakes after 3 hours of extensive reading and thinking.
Regarding my personal experience with Prep Cast. it was very positive, both with the course and with the test models. The classes cover all the PMBOK, the explanations on the ITTO's are clear and they cover the necessary for the PMP exam. The design of the presentations is very good, and the scope of them perfectly covers what is required in the exam. I recommend it either to those who need a course that can be done at different times or those who prefer to do it at their own pace and from any location. I took 2 month full time (5/6 hours a day) for preparing, my method was to watch PrepCast videos for one KA at a time and then read the same KA in the PMBOK. After I complete the Prep Cast course, I read the PMBOK once again, and then I took 5 test exams, with rating 72, 73, 77, 82 and 86.5.< /text>< Pics>

<Review>I passed the PMP Exam today on my first take.  Looking back, the PM Exam Simulator was pivotal in helping me deconstruct and synthesize the ideas and concepts presented in the PMBOK 6th edition. While the value of actively reading the PMBOK and attending the 35-hour training class cannot be overemphasised, this simulator helped me accomplish 2 things: mimic the actual exam experience and learn from all the mistakes I made answering the practice tests.  Great value for your money!<//Review>< resp>

Pass may PMP yesterday. A very big thanks to PMPrepcast Simulator and the people behind this simulator. The simulator really help me a lot in understanding the PMP processes and knowledge areas. The questions in the simulator really helps in analyzing what is in the Pmbok by referencing the answers to it. Really recommended to future exam takers for PMP. One more very important thing that helped is the live feedback. Where in one can click live feedback button on the question and ask for clarification directly from the helpdesk team regarding that particular question.

Thanks again and may this simulator help more future exam takers pass their exam.< /text>

The podcasts are easy to understand, a good pace, and cover most of the material you will need for the exam.  I suggest you also purchase the simulator exam.  I don't see how I would have passed the exam without it.  It helped to find-tune my test taking strategy.

<review>I took PM PrepCast about 2 years ago to prepare for my PMP exam. The content and the way of presentation were excellent. It wasn't boring at all, especially compared to other similar courses.

The fact that this course was very affordable and provided 35 hours of project management education required for PMP exam make it the best offer on the market.

The only downside (that for some people may be an upside!) was the length of the course. There were too many repetitions of the same concepts in different forms over and over. If there were fewer repetitions I think the course would be shorter and easier to complete faster. But on the other hand the repetitions help to remember the concepts better.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Their practice exams are the closest to the real thing of any test out there. With the knowledge that I was passing their practice tests and quizzes above target, I went into my exam calm and confident and passed above target in 2:30.

Prepcast has the best practice exams for a number of reasons:
1. Their questions are the most similar in language and difficulty to the real test.
2.  They explain the motivation and identify trick words in the questions.
3. They tell you why the right answer was right.
4. They tell you why the wrong answer was wrong.
5. They tell you the reference pages in the PMBOK Guide for further reading.
6. The user interface is the closest to the real test. (i.e. mouse buttons do the same thing etc.)

I'm definitely recommending them as a study tool to my friends/colleagues that are getting their PMP certifications.< /Text><pics>None</pics></record></dataset><record>

I recently cleared my PMP certification with Above Target  result. I used PMP prep-cast simulator for taking the mock tests. I can attest that this simulator is very close to what you'll get in real exam. The questions in real exam were of same level as that of simulator test. I will highly recommend this PMP exam simulator to anyone appearing for the exam.</Text>

First of all, I failed PMP test on my first try. Yes, first try, despite going through all the necessary protocol: I went through the training for requisite 37 hours, read the PMBOK Guide cover to cover and with the assistance of some Free Simulation Sites for more than three months.
My exam was CBT and at first I was very confident, but immediately I attempted the first 10 questions I got completely demoralized. I immediately realized the exam questions were all scenario-based questions unlike the questions adopted by the Free Simulation Sites I reviewed before the exam. The truth is that the PMP exam evaluates your understanding of the PM concepts not just what you have memorized from the Guide.
As an IT person, I have written over 10 certification exams over the years but that was the first exam I failed, so that experience was a serious disappointment. After the exam, I knew i must change my approach in order to succeed on my second try. First of all, I knew i had to get some additional materials to augment the PMBoK guide and again find a simulation site that has a scenario-based questions to test my preparations. I had a discussion with my immediate boss (who is PMP Certified too) in the office and he was surprised I didn't even read Rita Mulcahy book before sitting for the exam. So I later went to the internet and reviewed the best PMP simulation sites and the result showed the PM Prepcast site has the highest rating among many sites evaluated by Google users. Remember my new approach was getting additional materials and signing for PM Prepcast simulation, because the truth is that the pmp test syllabus covers merely 75% pmbok guide designed in a scenario-based style. I immediately signed for PM Prepcast simulation (only) and read the new materials side by side with the pmp guide for another three months before my second try.
On the 9th of March 2019, I sat for the test (Paper Based Test this time around) again and luckily I received my result on the 27th March and passed with flying colours (four ATs and one T) courtesy to this new approach. I must give credit to Prepcast, because all its questions are tailored in a scenario-based approach, and I can testify like many other pundits, that their questions are more difficult than the real pmp exam.
Based on my personal experience, If I’m to compare the difficulty level of the two, and let’s assume the pmp exam is on level 1, then Prepcast simulation must be on level 3. Remember, even in ordinary Game, higher levels are more difficult and I suppose that was the model the developers exploited in deploying the Prepcast questions-bank. As Expected, my exam went smoothly and in fact I got to the ‘Finish Line’ 20 minutes earlier. I utilized the 20 minutes to review the marked questions and all other questions with calculation.
For me, the PM Prepcast is the best pmp simulator in the world and I will always recommend it to other PMP aspirant. So far I have recommended it to two of my colleagues presently undergoing PMP classes.< /Review>

Great way to supplement reading the PMBOK.  Processes, Tools, Techniques and how to apply them are broken down and categorized into digestible / understandable bits.  It helps out tremendously with the breath of material, tools and techniques you are expected to know and apply.  The anywhere accessibility of the material is a huge VALUE ADD.  I believe this helps shorten the learning curve and helps with reaffirming areas that you need more help.  The lessons are always available to you on all the common devices.  The practice test were spot on and simulate the real exam.  Its best to take as many as you can - the reps eases the nerves plus helps with focus and exam time management.  Very positive experience on all fronts and really matched the way I needed to learn.  I passed my PMP on first try.</text>

<Text>I know that there are so many PMP aspirants out there looking for help to pass the exams and become PMP Certified, my honest advice for anyone in this situation is; “Look no further, PREPCAST by Cornelius Fitchner is the critical success factor that you need.
This could be the difference between getting certified and endlessly surfing the internet for help or moving from one study material to another. The PrepCast Video lessons and the PrepCast Exams Simulator truly and really will shape you and put you in the right frame for this all-important exam. Within 8 weeks of signing up for the PrepCast, I got PMP Certified.
Instructor Cornelius Fitchner and his awesome team deserves some ACCOLADES!<//Text>< userid>

But each of them is also available separately. And since we do have an unconditional money-back guarantee: Please contact our support team and ask for a partial refund. They will refund the PrepCast portion of your purchase and so you\'ll only have paid for the simulator. Please reference this conversation here and tell them that "the boss said it was OK".'}</response>

I found the videos to be of limited value.  If you read the PMBOK, they are simply a summary of the text.  The real gold in this package is the practice tests.  I found the most value out of doing the practice questions where I could immediately view the PMI answer.  These tests allowed me to score above average in all of the exam areas.  I do recommend this for the practice tests.  I had purchased tests from a couple of different sources.  The ones included here were of the most value and closely matched what I encountered on the test.  I would like to see an option (and I just may have missed it) to purchase only the practice tests.

I received a response from the Prepcast team and am changing this from 3 stars to 5!  good customer service is KEY!</review><user>108066770544164782016</user><date>1534878393938<//date></record></dataset><record>

I highly recommend the PMP Prepcast. I used this to help pass my PMP in 2017. It’s a good refresher and the most important piece is the exam simulation. It covers the individual process groups and knowledge areas so that you can see what domain you need to apply more focus on. It’s also great with learning the ITTOs and how they fit in each aspect of the process. The exam questions are spot on. If you know the ITTOs you will be better prepared to sit for the exam with confidence.< /review>

10 stars for the PM PreCast practice questions/simulator. I had the mock questions for only one month. December 28 - Feb 1st. Took my exam on Feb 2nd and I passed.

My strategy - Studied Rita book twice, and did couple of practice questions and scored 74% on the simulator in late November. I still felt like something was missing. Around mid December I came across PM prepcast via a friend, I went through few questions and right then I knew that this was what I needed. Yes it closely mirrors the real exam. Overall, it's a little bit more sophisticated than the real exam. Which is a good thing.

My analogy is that if you practice with robust and tough questions, the exams will be easier. It's like going into a boxing match with your friend after you have successfully sparred with Mike Tyson. You will knock your buddy out easily. LOL. Yes it worked, thank God!!

Make these practice questions your best buddy, bring them with you everywhere! I take few questions every chance that I get. At home on my laptop, on my smart phone when I'm out. Sometimes when I'm in the parking lot of a grocery store I quickly do 10 questions, review the ones I got right and the ones I got wrong. Read all the explanations to the multiple choices. This is GOLD!! That's how you actually learn.

You acquire 40% knowledge from studying books/materials and the rest 60% is in practice questions. These practice questions conditions your brain/mind to understand how the PMP questions are being structured. Take short questions 10 -30, review and repeat until you are through with the whole question bank. Then go back and revisit the ones you failed. There's a 90% chance that you will pass if you dedicate your time and follow this strategy.

Finally don't waste your time studying the PMBOK. You don't need it to pass the exam!! I read the PMBOK for only 20 minutes and never revisited it. Thank you PM PrepCast and good luck to all the PMP aspirants!!</Text>

I am very impressed with Prepcast's way of teaching and imparting knowledge. The online courses are very user friendly and easy to learn from. Mr. Fichtner's way of teaching PMBOK guide is very explanatory to the extent that it hits most of the questions asked in the exam. I will fully give credit to Prepcast for making me pass my PMP-PMI exam in first attempt.< /text>

I previously used Rita's Course Book and its FastTrack questions and I did not get close to passing the test.  Second time around I spent some time understanding the PM processes using a book by Andy Crowe, which helped me retain some of the processes.  Finally I started testing myself via Prepcast.  Hands down this is the best software to learn the processes and understand what situations to use them in.  The answers to the questions give you a full explanation of why all of the wrong answers are wrong and why the correct answer is the best choice. There are over 1000 questions.  The questions can be broken down between knowledge areas, process areas, answered wrong, unanswered questions, timed, and learning tests.  Furthermore, you can see your all of your test scores over time which helps you see that you have made progress.  I started out at 30%-60% on my first 10 question tests.  By the time I finished using the tool, I was regularly getting between 80%-100% on 10 question tests.  When I saw my progress I knew I was ready for the test.  I took it and the test was so easy for me I got bored 100 questions into it.  I also passed at close to above target, but still in the on target range.  I highly recommend this tool!

I passed the PMP exam in 1 go with above target scores, after practicing 3 PM Prepcast Exams with scores >70%, and also fully reviewing the Formula guide and practice exam. Studying the PMBOK Guide + PM Prepcast practice exams + the PM Prepcast formula guide was perfect for me to pass the exam. The PM Prepcast materials are top notch!</Text>

I bought the Exam package from PM Prepcast and have no regrets.
I tried the 7-day trial and it was ok if you're just figuring out if you're even interested in going for the PMP credential.
But if you've passed that stage & planning on actually taking the exam, the PMBoK Guide & PM Prepcast Exam package are definitely the tools you need.
I bought the exam package a week before the exam and took 6 of the exams and a few others such as Oliver Lehmann (very difficult & excellent to prep an exam attemptee.

<Text>I recently passed the PMP certification exam using mostly the exam simulator by the Prepcast team. I took a 3 month long online course prior but ended up travelling overseas for a long period of time after the class was over. I had pretty much forgotten almost everything I had studied and had to either enroll in a boot camp or try and review my notes. I had just 2 weeks to take the test.

Fortunately, I stumbled upon the website and signed up for the exam simulator. I took 7/8 -200 question exams twice  and reviewed everything I got wrong along the way. I'm happy to say this product had a big part in my passing of the PMP certification Exam. Do yourself a favor and sign up.<//Text><Response>{'time': 1537831727445, 'text': "Congratulations on passing your exam and thank you for allowing us to play 'a big part' in your success!"}</Response><Date>1537830295131<//Date>< Gmap_id>

There are many ways to prepare for PMP certification, the most important is always your personal project experience. However, I found that going through PrepCast (after reading PMBOK) was a great way to relate the PMBOK material with real life projects. The course provides numerous insights and tips that you might not necessarily pickup in your own studies. The practice exams were invaluable! If you treat them like actual exams each time (write them in a complete 4 hour uninterrupted window) they are (in my opinion) the best way to prepare you for the type of questions and stamina needed for the actual certification exam. Excellent course and material Cornelius and team!</Review>

Excellent way to prep for the PMP exam. Great videos and mock exams and quizzes! I highly suggest this!

Exam result: pass
Above target - initiating
Above target - planning
Target- execution
Target - monitor controlling
Below target - closing

The most similar questions came from the practice quizzes and exams from PMPREPCAST. Those were very very similar to the real thing.

My exam prep: I took an in-person 10-week class at Oklahoma City University, we met once a week. I also completed an online class after that PMPREPCAST (Cornelius) AFTER I completed the 10-week class.

I did four mock exams total, (full mock exams – 4 hours, 200 questions each)
1st one was the final of my in person class 75%
2nd was online PREPCAST 75%
3rd was online PREPCAST 77.5%
4th was all Rita practice exam questions in her book (about 378 questions) 72%<//Text>

<text>I bough PMI-ACP exam simulator from PM PrepCast. Simulator offers 4 mock exams. Questions quality is not up to the mark and many questions are ambiguous. However, questions helped me prepare for wide range of topics, which I might have missed otherwise. Also, live feedback support on problems is excellent. Recommended!< /text></record>

< Review>
The PM PrepCast Exam Simulator was a critical component of my preparations for the PMP exam. The explanations for the answer choices were very clear and helped me understand how to apply concepts from my other testing materials and even in my work.  I found the questions to be more challenging than those on the actual exam. This only served to build my confidence on test day. I highly recommend the PM PrepCast (and PodCast) to aspiring PMPs.<//Review>

After reading up on all of the available online PMP preparation courses, I chose PM PrepCast, and was very happy with it. I used the PrepCast videos for a first overview of all of the PMBOK Guide content, and then also studied from the Guide itself, and from a separate prep book. I then also used the PMP Exam Simulator from the same company that offers the PM PrepCast, which was essential to practice realistic questions before taking the actual exam. I passed the exam on my first try.< /Text>

<text>The PMP Exam Simulator Premium was one of the critical keys to my success in passing the PMP on my first attempt.  Being able to take shorter, customized quizzes allowed me to focus on weak areas, shore them up, then re-quiz to improve.

My $.02 is to take a baseline full exam, take 10-15 question quizzes in each of the knowledge areas, study what you get wrong, then re-take the focused quizzes until you pass each 3 times.  Then re-take a full exam and see how you do, rinse, and repeat.  The Simulator provides the closest test experience compared to the real PMP.

Godspeed everyone,

Prep cast Practice exams were alot harder than the real exam so I won't give 5 stars. I scored 60-65% on my prepcast exams but I passed the exam . If you have difficulty sitting and concentrating on exam for hours use prep cast to manage time and practice. I recommend doing Rita s pmp exam prep book to cover material then do the prep cast. Even you score 65% in this, you should be able to manage the real exam to passing score .good luck.<//Review><rating>4</rating>< pics>

I did purchase the Prepcast video and Exam Simulation, unfortunately I did not clear the PMP exam.  I note that for PMBOK 6, the exam questions are extremely wordy and I have not encountered any similar questions in the Exam simulator.  Not many calculation questions though.< /Text>

<review>PM PrepCast is the best.  I am an 8-5 working mom with a 5 and 7 year old.  I have barely enough time to do anything for myself let alone study for a 4 hour exam.   I qualified to sit the exam in December 2017 however a month later I discovered the PMI board would be upgrading the exam  to the 6th edition in March 2018.  In a panic, I went online to search for the top 10 PMP online prep courses and the PM PrepCast was listed #1.....I can see why! I scheduled my exam in March and began studying after the Christmas break early February.  Each morning before the kids woke up, while on my treadmill I watched the videos.  I doubled up on weekends and holidays.  The tapes were logical and easy to follow.  Every thing covered was applicable  to the exam....I went to the test center a day in advance as recommended and even went out for dinner and watched a movie the night before.  The next morning I practiced my data dump sheet and passed the exam on the first try.  If I can do it you can too.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

PM Prepcast is a highly recommended tool to study for the PMP exam preparation.  Although other exam simulators out there are also good, what sets Prepcast apart is this really helped me rewire my brain into PMIism.  The structure are very similar to the actual exams, but are definitely harder than the real exam.  I was only able to do 3 out of the 6 full 200 exams due to time constraint.  Then I was also already getting very disappointed because I wasn't meeting my 80% goals from the full exams.  The highest I got was 70% of the 200 questions.  I just concentrated on the short quizzes during the last two weeks before my exam to give me enough time to review my answers as I only have 2-3 hours each night to study and four hours on weekends.  I passed with Above Target mark.  This simulator is highly recommended.</text>

It was second time when I used PM PrepCast from OSP INTERNATIONAL. After preparing with the use of their methods and materials and successfully passing the PMP exam, I had no doubt about the use of materials from this company to prepare for passing the PMI-ACP.
This is a professionally developed preparation technique for PMI exam passing, which I am personally convinced of the second time. The technique offers a detailed discussion of the answers, which actually means re-working the theory through practical questions.
I want to thank the authors and developers of this course.< /Review>

<text>I found PM PrepCast to be a useful tool that truly helped me pass my PMP exam.  Not only did I gain the benefit of passing my PMP exam, I also have knowledge about how a project should be managed and what I need to do to remain a successful PMP.
The training videos are lengthy, with a lot of repetition.  This can be both a benefit and a hindrance.  At first, I was getting frustrated with the repetitions at the beginning of each video. But along the way I started repeating the same materials and in no time I was understanding the video trainings much better.
If anyone is not interested in the repetitions, skip over, but I would advise not to.  Repetition helps it stick!</text><pics>None<//pics><Response>{'time': 1526317865752, 'text': 'Admiral -- Congrats on passing the exam and thanks for your review/feedback.

<rating>1</rating><Text>During the year of 2017 I was planning to enter the PMP exam but could not even schedule it due to the usual busy schedule at work (the real reason being not assigning the needed priority to this matter). Then at the end of December 2017 I heard the exam contents changes to PMBOK6 in March 2018 but again it was only at the end of January 2018 when I became PMI member and scheduled the exam for March 20, 2018 (the latest free slot that I could find for my location).
I spent the whole February to complete only the thorough reading of PMBOK5, spending on average 2 hours per day (4 hours on weekends) since I continued to go to office. Then in March 2018 I decided to take 2 weeks off to have full dedication for studying Rita's Book supported by free exam simulators and Cornelius Fichtner videos from OSP International, a pocket exam book of Rita, some exam questions from previous trainings (I had attended one formal 36-hour PMP prep course back in December 2014 outside office and an additional one in 2017 at office, both based on PMBOK5) During the last two weeks I studied 8-10 hours per day on average. Besides, I have worked in project and program management in 2014-2017 period. During the preparation for the exam in the moments when I felt I would not make it due to shortage of time to prepare properly for the exam, the two advices that I liked most were 1) Do not over study! 2) Not all of the questions at the exam will be that difficult. I did not run any mock exam with more than 20 questions at a time. Since I heard a lot of warnings that many run out of time during the exam, my strategy at the exam was to quickly pass and answer ALL the questions by marking the ones that I was not sure about. I marked some 25-30 and had couple of questions not answered at all but at the second pass I changed my mind only on two of the marked ones and answered the remaining two. With this much effort and practical work background plus headphones (for full focus) and a single short call-of-the-nature break I was able to pass the exam in my first attempt.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>{'time': 1530884634252, 'text': 'Congratulations on passing the exam on such a tight schedule, Ergün.

<time>1535654733395< /time><Review>The Prepcast was the only resource I used to prepare myself for the PMP. I used the prepcast + exam simulator + formulas sheet.

<userid>114488391518618406563< /userid><pics>None<//pics><text>First of all, thank you, Cornelius for your outstanding work on the PrepCast series.  The series was my first set of material used in my PMP exam prep journey. I passed the exam, thanks to the concise yet comprehensive material.  Although it is recommended by most to read the PMBOK guide cover to cover several times, I had skimmed it only once. I tried reading it a second time but found that it took too long.  I resorted to using the copious notes I had taken while listening to your podcasts.  That worked for me.  Along with another study guide,  I was confident enough to pass the exam.

I do have a couple of suggestions:

1 - While I know that the questions in the PMP exam is different for everyone, mine felt like most of the questions had more than one "very good" answer.  It was stressful throughout the exam trying to pick the best one.  My experience with the PrepCast mock exams were a little different in that most of the answer choices were clear that there is only one good answer.  As such, I was able to finish the mock exams within 3 hours every time and score well.  On the real exam, I took the 4 entire hours and could have used a few more minutes to review the marked questions.  The suggestion here would be to incorporate multiple good answers in your questions to better mimic the real exam.

2 - On your calculation questions, it would be good if the bar chart (introduction to the question) is different in every mock exam.  I found that every time I see the same bar chart, I'm "cheating" when I get the question correct because I had seen the chart before and did not need to read the details more carefully.

Thanks once again!<//text>< Rate>

I would highly recommend this program. It is a lot more affordable than many of the "boot camps" and I really liked the thorough explanations. I think it would be a great study tool for those who learned English as a second language. Fitchner speaking pace is a little slower and repetitive. He simplifies difficult concepts by breaking them down so that students can better understand.

Very happy with my result! :)<//Text>< GmapID>

<review>An absolute must for the PMP exam. The videos are helpful in gaining a true understanding of the terms without needing to memorize every single ITTO flowchart. They are presented clearly and broken down into easily digestible segments. You will really want to set a schedule because you'll have 50+ hours to watch, but it's much easier than in person courses.

The exam simulators are a must as well. The different between the simulator and the actual exam were so minor that it felt like just another practice test. I felt confident going in to my exam and will be recommending it to colleagues also looking to get their PMP.< /review><rate>5</rate><gmap_id>0x80dcdaea30496c3b:0x6197bf09e1400df8< /gmap_id><user>104506085578775276799</user>< date>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>I have the PM PrepCast and PMP Exam Simulator. While I am not yet at the point of using the simulator, I have gone through more than half the videos, as I am studying for my CAPM exam (to be held in February), and I am very pleased with my progress thus far.  Cornelius' voice is charming and smooth; hard to fall asleep or get distracted. He uses humour but not enough to distract from what is important. I highly recommend!

[Edit: May 2018] I successfully completed my CAPM exam this month! I used the PM PrepCast as my main tool because Cornelius Fichtner's voice is very soothing!! I complemented with other tools that I borrowed from my local library, for topics that required a bit more from me. The videos were great because I was able to view/listen to them on the go. I created my own cheat sheets and often used screenshots from the PrepCast, as the visuals were clear and explanatory. Towards the end, when I used the practice exam questions, I found it helpful that there were sets of 15 questions at a time because it helped ease me into taking longer practice exams. Great tool, that I highly recommend!

Best wishes to everyone studying; you can do it!!<//Text><pics>None<//pics><Response>{'time': 1511186782572, 'text': 'I am blushing! Thank you for calling my voice "charming and smooth".'}<//Response>< Gmap_id>

PM-Prepcast deliver high quality PM content with a well-designed presentation. In the other hand PM-Exam-Simulator is quite more hard than the real exam, i suggest you to pass >70% before take the exam, after constantly ahieved >70% score, i'm sure that you will pass the real exam.

PrepCast provides a comprehensive course materials of all covered topics in details which allow me to study PMP success, through the simulate exams tool, it is very closed to the real exam questions and let’s me know which domain strength and weakness

The Agile PrepCast was an excellent beginning to my studies for the PMI-ACP Exam. I found the content to be well organized and clearly presented, with plenty of real-world examples. The style was consistent throughout most of the episodes, except for (understandably) those included from the PMP PrepCast. As my first formal Agile training class, I found the series to be an excellent introduction to and explanation of all the component parts of the PMI-ACP certification. I appreciated the opportunity to gain not only the required contact hours of training, but the 37 PDUs I earned were a huge bonus that enabled me to renew my PMP certification early!

Ultimately, the Exam Simulator was key to my success in passing the PMI-ACP Exam on my first try. I scored 75% after completing the course, then studied from the Mike Griffiths PMI-ACP Exam Prep book and workbook to expand my understanding. Afterwards, I repeated the Exam Simulator test 3 times until I got my score above 90%. That built my confidence and enabled me to pass the exam on my first try.< /Text>

PM PrepCast is packed with knowledge on Project Management and its all in one spot.  I downloaded them in iTunes and listened to them during my commute.  Cornelius does an excellent job preparing the audio and making it easy to submit these for your PDUs with PMI.   Looking forward to trying the Agile PrepCast next.<//text>

I started prepping for the PMBOK 5th edition exam on 3/22/18. I was one of the those who PMI shat upon and after cancelling the test due to weather they did not allow PMI members an opportunity to reschedule before the exam change.
Unlike PMI, Cornelius and his team did not balk at this and immediately upgraded my Premium membership to PMBOK 6 at no charge!
Not only is the course great and the content and delivery robust but the information is presented in a manner that is conducive to maintaining a study plan and passing the PMP.
Thank God for PM Prep Cast!<//review>

<Text>I highly recommend utilizing the PMP PrepCast by Cornelius Fitchner to prepare for the PMP Exam. The program has many strong aspects.  The most notable aspects from which I benefited include:
•	the structure in the way the information is presented,
•	the emphasis on learning objectives that maximize learning of the material needed to be a well prepared PMP,
•	the supplemental information and tools available to prepare for the exam and to become a better prepared PMP,
•	the Simulator (Exam Simulator complete with solutions and cogent explanations for correct and incorrect responses) is invaluable to your learning the information, and more specifically, informs you to what taking the actual exam will be like which may be a quite different experience for many,
•	and the rigor that is built into the curriculum minimizes the uncertainty throughout the process and exam.
The process is very beneficial, and is a significant effort and accomplishment.  That comes with the investment in time as with any achievement.  I highly recommend you approach your preparation as prescribed by the program.  Corenelius’ program will help you manage your time appropriately, as well as give a logical way to attack the volumes of information and tools available.<//Text>< pictures>

I used the PrepCast (PMBOK 5th Ed) and a few books to study for my PMP exam, which I passed on the first try. The formula guide that accompanied the PrepCast was very helpful. The lectures, however, contain a lot of repetitive contents (overview of the knowledge area and process groups) and I didn't finished all of the lectures. I took several practice exams using the simulator. The simulator gives a realistic feel of the exam experience. However, some of the practice exam questions on ITTOs are a bit too stringent and I disagree with some of the answers. When I looked up those questions on the 6th Ed of the PMBOK guide, I found that my answers to those questions would be correct based on the updated PMBOK guide, which has more comprehensive and logical ITTOs. Based on my exam experience, the ITTOs asked on the exam can be answered by common sense. The PrepCast discussion forum is excellent. I have found a lot of like-minded students and the discussions are very helpful, as I don't have a local study group. Overall, I think PrepCast is a solid exam preparation product, but I would advise the students to think more broadly on the sample ITTO questions.<//text>
<pics>None< /pics><resp>{'time': 1517255542011, 'text': 'Thank you for this comprehensive feedback Angela. We have already addressed two of your critique points: In our new PrepCast Sixth edition we have removed much of the repetition that you have seen. (This also bothered me, so I took action to remove it). And as far as the ITTO questions go, we are reviewing and rewriting every single one of our simulator questions based on the new requirements, style and type of questions on the actual exam. This means that almost all ITTO questions are disappearing. Some will remain but the questions themselves are more situational than knowledge based. In this way new students will not feel the repetitiveness nor have as many ITTO questions.'}</resp><Gmap_id>0x80dcdaea30496c3b:0x6197bf09e1400df8</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<userid>112912563199743874571</userid><pictures>None</pictures><Text>I had come across PM PrepCast through the internet.  I bookmarked the page and thought of first going through the PMBOK guide before buying the video lessons.  One fine day that is on 27th of November 2017, I decided to buy the lessons irrespective of the fact that I had not finished  studying the PMBOK guide.  I just followed the advises in the  prepcast lessons and I found that the preparations were really simplified.  The  way in which the important aspects were presented and emphasized, made learning so simple and fun.  I did give training to all my project engineers in all the pm processes and this re-enforced  my learing which I got from the PM PrepCast.  The PrepCast was also a great way to get back to some concepts whenever required to refer.
Despite my busy work schedule, I made it a point to finish seven out of the nine practice tests.  Though in the actual test, I found the situational questions to be slightly more difficult than the practice test, the confidence building that could be achieved by practicing the tests was really amazing.</Text>< time>

I would say that the PM Prepcast is an essential tool for anyone that's looking to get their PMP certification. The Prepcast allows you to turn normally unproductive time (commuting, walking, etc) into much needed study time for the PMP, which is a huge deal when you've got a busy work/ home life.< /Text>

Prepcast was my main study material for the PMP. I watched the Prepcast modules first then read the corresponding section of the PMBOK. The Prepcast added context and examples so that I could apply real world situations to the PMBOK processes. I passed the PMP on my first try and the PrepCast modules and test simulations prepared me to do so. I would recommend it to anyone studying for the PMP.< /review>

Hi,
I cleared my PMP on first attempt last week. Many Thanks for the 10 simulator exam. It helped me a lot. I didnt find difference between the Prepcast simulator and the real PMP exam. I felt happy that I bought the simulator. Thanks for that.
I like to know what is the next step or next certification for me to take as a next stage. Does PrepCast can help on that?.
Appreciate your response.

Thanks,
Kamal.</Text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>Pros:

The PMP certification addresses extremely useful content, but in most cases learning it can be challenging. It's not because the material is complicated, but rather human nature. Let's be honest: learning best practices for putting together e.g. a schedule management plan can make for dry material at best.

Enter Cornelius Fichtner. With an enthusiasm that defies belief, he lays out the material in a thoughtfully logical sequence and pays attention to providing just the right amount of content. It's enough to make the material understandable and retainable without delving too far into the weeds. He explains why the pieces of information he is explaining are important,  and how they connect to the other topics already discussed.

The course is a lot of hours of video (which is also required for it to qualify with PMI) so it requires some determination to get through it, but figuring out I could use ear buds to take my computer to my favorite hookah cafe to sit down with Digital Cornelius was sufficient to (eventually) get me through all of the videos, typically in stints of 2-3 hours at a time.

After completing the PM PrepCast course I comfortably passed the test with highest marks in all sections. Many of the project management experience hours described on my PMI application were with a teensy startup that had run out of money, so I was "randomly selected" for an audit, but it was all verifiably true and PMI was happy with the PM PrepCast as the course I took, so I am now a certified PMP. As a side benefit, after 15-20 hookah cafe stints with Digital Cornelius in 2-3 hour stretches, even a year later I can still pull off a killer Cornelius Fichtner impression to impress all my friends and guests at parties.

A final nice thing about the PM Prepcast is the ability to download the videos -- they are well-organized and succinct, so I put them on a work computer to have them at my fingertips in case I ever need a refresher on some of the finer points. 8/10, would repeat (if I really really had to)

Cons:
For awhile Cornelius's chipper Swiss voice haunted my dreams, happily chattering about earned value management and procurement performance reviews as the soundtrack to a gigantic battle between Godzilla and Biollante, except one of them was actually a Schedule Performance Index and the other was a Cost Performance Index. I got over it though.< /Text>< pictures>

<text>It took me a lot of time to decide if I want to go for classroom training or online training. Lot of my friends had suggested classroom but I was not comfortable with attending 4 day classes over two weekends. So I decided to go for online training.
Before deciding on pm prepcast I did a lot of research on different online providers. I was looking for good quality videos and good support. After reviewing and reading loads of user comments I finally decided on pm prepcast and it turned out to be a very good decision. Not only the quality of the videos is very good but if you have read Pmbok or any other book (I read Rita) before watching the videos you can very easily relate to the material. The way the content is covered is easy to understand as the video durations are not very long. So you can do one or two in one sitting and not get overwhelmed. I used to do two in mornings and one in evening so it work d out for me.
The other thing I really liked is then way Cornelius has explained how to prepare for the exam and about the application process. It was really very helpful for me as I did not have any other support while preparing. I studied alone and took about 10 weeks to finish the exam. Though I had read pmbok and Rita earlier but it was only after going through the videos that I got confident about the material.
The support is just amazing. I used to post questions and used to get reply very quickly. Thanks for that.
Overall I am very happy that I opted or pm prepcast and cleared the exam in first attempt. Now I have already started to plan for maintaining the certification and I currently reviewing the pdus offered by pm prepcast.
I want to thank Cornelius and whole pm prep cast team.
Thanks

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>Cornelius Fichtner certainly knows his stuff and knows how to teach it.  I took the PMP PMPrepcast online course and not only was it a great value, dollar-wise, it was also an excellent preparation course for the PMP exam.  Cornelius' shared knowledge and most important, enthusiasm conveyed the expectation that if you study the material, you will pass the exam.  He had a lot of very positive comments that set a level of expectation, that I didn't find in the books that I read.  Many/most/all of those attempted to embed a fear of failure.  There was no hint of that with Cornelius and his material.

Please accept our apologies for not addressing your concerns earlier.\n\nThe issues you reported trouble us very much, and we would like to understand more about them. While we value customer feedback and use it to continuously improve our products and services, we believe that the feedback should accurately reflect our product. We were confused by the description of the problems because they did not seem to match our products.\n\nWe are not sure to what video you are referring in your review. Assuming you are talking about The PM PrepCast video lessons, the instructor speaks very clear English language with a British accent. So far, we have not received a single complaint about the accent. We have only received positive inputs about the clarity of the language and the personal touch the instructor creates with the viewer/listener. However, if you have difficulties understanding the accent and suggest to add subtitles to the video, we will forward your feedback to the relevant team.\n\nRegarding routing to India, we can assure you, we have no operations in India. Our headquarters are in California and the employees are located in the United States; we have associates in Canada and the Philippines. Nothing is routed to India.\n\nThe satisfaction of our students is a primary concern, which is why we have a no-questions-asked, money-back guarantee policy for all of our products.

<Review>I was using the project management prepcast PMP simulator about 2 years ago to prepare for my PMP exam. I tried a few free simulators back then, but liked the prepcast the most. Their simulator has a very nice user interface, and it does not require a download. So you can use it from any place and on any device. Well, I did not test on all of course, but it worked on my Windows laptop and iPhone. Very convenient. The questions in the simulator are comparable with what I eventually encountered on my real PMP exam. But the main feature which I really liked and what I did not see from any other companies, is their live feedback. For example, if you need a clarification on a specific question or you just disagree with the correct answer, you can click the live feedback button right on the screen of that question, and one of their PMP guys gets back to you with a detailed explanation of why the correct answer is really correct. Well, sometimes they were wrong, and I even succeeded to convince them to change some of their questions, which I guess was very helpful for them, but also helped me to gain my confidence in my knowledge. This communication back and forth was highly valuable and helped me a lot. It's like having your own PMP coach for free. Well done, prepcast! I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is preparing for their PMP exam. Well worth the money and really prepares you for THE day!</Review><user_name>staspo< /user_name>< gmap_id>

I bought only the Exam simulations - they are excellent; questions are a bit harder than the real exam (which is good), and all answers -good and bad- come up with an explanation and literature reference, which is very helpful.<//text>

Money well spent for 3 months of access to this software.  This tool is a valuable part of your PMP study arsenal as it allows you to customize your quizzes to target specific areas of study and provides good and sometimes excellent explanations for all of the answer choices to the the test questions. It also includes 3 full length exams that simulate the actual exam in both # of questions and time.  I paid for it  on 3/29 and passed my PMP on 5/7.<//text>
