I've been coming here for a while now and each time it never disappoints! They always have their classic flavors and flavors that rotate. All their ice cream always taste fresh and healthy!<//Review>

For a first-time experience it was pretty good. But the staff is kind of not very personable with kind of a chip on the shoulder attitude. This franchise needs to work on better training for more or less attitude and happier faces.

Let me start off by saying I have never in my life felt so disrespected and humiliated. My only fault was being a loyal customer for the last 8 months, spending at minimum $50 dollars a week on "icecream", receiving multiple unlimited cups for enormous amount of frozen yogurts I consume and provide for my study group students. The store manager named Aaron was extremely disrespectful and rude beyond belief. I have never taken the time to write a negative review about a business or about anybody, but this was necessary. I will never ever walk in to this store ever again and I will make sure anybody that I know will not as well because of a rude young man who has a title of store manager and behaves in such a disrespectful way, being a "perfect" example for other workers. You guys seriously need to re-evaluate who you hire and more importantly who you hire as managers to lead by example. Upon my observation throughout the months of visiting, he would always (10/10 times) hide behind utility room (I'm really curious what he is always doing back there during his working hours) and when I make noises from the machines he would slowly walkout as if I'm an invisible person. That is completely okay and I don't mind that anymore. I am not a person patronizing workers by requiring them to greet me. But as I walked out of the door strenuously carrying multiple cups of icecream as usual, he shouted at my back, "WELCOME!" thinking I'll leave without even saying thank you. I guess he thinks customers have the obligation to act certain ways but he doesn't. Moreover, he talks to everyone in such a patronizing way, its so hard to describe and extremely difficult to hear. Botton line, I quit going to frozen yogurt and most certainly to this location where Aaron works. Aaron does not deserve to have this job and more importantly does not deserve to have a job as a general manager.
Thank you so much for taking your precious time to read my review.< /text>

compared to Yogurtland outlets in other areas, this one provides about two thirds of the flavors and no seating inside. There are fewer flavors and fewer toppings available. Still, the quality is about the same as other Yogurtland locations. Situated in a beautiful plaza adjacent to a water fountain and plenty of outdoor seating.<//review>

< Review>
Do not go to this location.  It is small and only has half the flavors as the Spectrum. The only person working there was really rude. I made a comment to the person I was with that I didn't like the store because they had half the flavors and no whipped cream.  The guy working there rudely said, "I heard what you said ". He had no right to comment as I was talking to my friend,  not loudly , or to him. I will not be going back to this location. The one at the Spectrum is so much nicer and the employees are professional.< /Review>

It's a great location for a yogurt shop, but it has very few flavors compared to most Yogurtland locations. They only had 1 of the 4 on the poster in their window.<//text>

Mary and the employees at the Redwood city DMV were so friendly and helpful. My best experience at any DMV yet. In and out in ~20 minutes to renew my license without an appointment! The earliest available appointment was in 2.5 weeks so I opted for walk in. Recommend checking the wait times online to strategize when to go.<//review>

It helps to have an appointment, non-appontment line seems to go faster. I am here to get my REAL ID before the deadline of Oct 1, 2020. Plan  on waiting 1-3+ hours for this. Have ALL of the documents required or you'll need to postpone your appointment for another day.<//Review>

Usually, the DMV gets criticized. It's the face of bureaucracy. But, it was very organized and health-conscious. You are met by an employee outside, quizzed, given a number and they collect your cell number so you can be texted to both track your spot and be notified when it's your turn. The rep was efficient and polite. They got the job done! You can now expedite getting your Real ID online and drop in to complete getting it.< /Text>

They gave a #G103 . When it was called after only a 35 minute wait. I walked up to the assigned window. Only to find out someone else was there with my # too.
Instead of being after that person. I had to go back to first line, get a new # and wait through the whole cycle again. Ridiculous! 😡</Review>

I have been here several times, people are supportive and helpful. The line is long but the fast services and neutral environment are not that stressful.
Here is what you need for your new ID.<//Review>

I arrived at 5:45 because I heard people arrive hours early at CA DMVs. I was the only one there. People didn’t start showing up until around 7:15. Around 7:45 a DMV employee went down the line asking everyone why they were there and checked for correct documentation. He was a little gruff, but he was trying to make everything run smoothly so that nobody wasted their time. He told some people they could do what they needed to do on line. I thought this was pretty efficient. A few people gladly left the line. Once I was called inside a very nice woman checked my documents again, then gave me a number. It took around half an hour until they called my number. The DMV is never a good time, but I thought everything was handled quite well.<//Review>

Please try to get more automation asap so we don't have to deal with these people.<//Text>< UserId.>

Did not expect to be treated with a condescending, disrespectful manner after I talked with a nice tone and peacefully gave all the information they need. The elderly lady by the entrance gave me a hard time and insulted me. She needs to welcome people in the DMV with a welcoming and respectful attitude. Also this DMV is very slow and inefficient for any standards. They should build a bigger place with better trained personnel. Looks like their is more parking space than maximum occupation. Please avoid this DMV.<//text>

Really efficient service, extremely helpful employees. I didn't feel like they were trying to rush me out of there, they made sure that everything was completely taken care of and double checked my paperwork. Also felt like the covid precautions and lines were really organized and effective. Its weird to say, but this is my favorite DMV in west bay. Sometimes there are long lines, like at any DMV, but you can check online and plan to come when it's emptier. I came at 8:30am on a Monday and there was basically no wait, took no time at all.<//text>

<review>COVID visit.  My online Title transfer was a fiasco.  I waited online on the phone for over 2 hours only to have the woman tell me it was my own fault for not knowing the ins and outs of titles and that I had to go in to the DMV.

I arrived at 12:22 and left by 1:19.  The line moved. The people answered questions.  The woman inside fixed my problem, didn't give me a hassle for not knowing the fine points of car titles.  She is my new hero.

Kindness counts and kindness with efficiency is wonderful.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x80c29768a139c21b:0x362f6e4e8aadd51f<//gmap_id></record>

Worst DMV. They close off at anytime they feel like.
I went for DL renew and asked what papers I need. They say just the DL.
After you go inside they ask papers. When I come back they say it's closed 10 min before 5:00. I go next day and they say its close off at 04:00. They need to understand that people take time off their work to come to DMV<//Text>

Absolutely impossible to make a behind-the-wheel test appointment close to Redwood City, any time I look the computer says they're all taken (3 months!) - I wonder if anybody in DMV cares about btw tests availability in Bay Area at all?!< /Text>< pictures>

The complexity in the forms that needs to be completed (both online and on paper), the rush for folks to get the REAL ID, and questions asked by most people to the DMV agents equates to longer wait times.

Everyone working at the DMV want folks to come in and out ASAP and they do their very best to be as efficient as possible.<//Text><Rating>5<//Rating>< gmapID>

Pleasantly surprised that it only took 1.5 hours to get a RealID update to my driver's license & order a license renewal. For the latter I had to have a new photo taken & pass & 18 question quiz. I stood in two different lines and sat in waiting area. I made my appointment 3 months ago. 9am was a good time to come...the traffic was easy coming north on 101 which was unexpected.< /Text>

I can't give 5 stars, cuz it's still the DMV after all, but I'm very happy with my experience today! Thank you to the employees who tolerate all of us every day.< /Review>< response>

<review>I visited this office yesterday morning to renew my DL . It took about 2 hours, much less than I had expected. The system seemed organized well and thus efficient. The staffs were generally kind and helpful. Of course, the process can be improved furthermore. But it is not so frustrating as often thought.< /review>< Pictures>

Organized and operates with decent efficiency. Staff are friendly enough, but keep in mind they are dealing with hundreds of people a day. Patience is a must. It's like sitting in rush hour traffic. If you don't have an appointment, expect to be here about 2 hours or so. If you don't have an appointment, it is best to either get here more than 30 minutes before they open, or around 2pm in the afternoon.

If you have an appointment, you just need to check in, you don't have to wait in line. They don't explain this very well and it would be helpful if they had some signage that says this.

Driving tests are done by appointment only. If you can't get an appointment here, and the rest of the Bay area is booked, try somewhere further south, such as Capitola.<//Review>

Didn't have an appointment. Showed up at 9:45am on Wednesday where they open at 9am. Start to finish was 2 hours and I got to sit for about half of that. As good as one could hope for from bureaucracy.</Text>

Appointment: No need to worry. It'll be quick.
Walk-ins: Quick suggestion, arrive 30-45 mins before opening.
Also, the timings are not correct on the Google for weekdays. Today's Thursday, it opens at 8 AM. It's 8:44 right now and I'm done with my licence application.
So come here before 7:15 AM.< /text>

Terrible service, wait for 2 hours can’t get it. I was told that I can only do one item per visit. If I need to do second item I need to get in line again. It doesn’t make sense at all. Staff is very rude.<//text>

I waited for 3.5 hrs and finally got chance to proceed. They cannot scan my passport and need to send to headquarter for manual authentication. They asked me to call back if I don’t receive a letter in 2 months. My passport is totally valid and just successfully got a Schengen visa. I asked them then can I drive with my NY license and they say they can still give a ticket to you but usually they let you go. WTH.<//Text>

So apparently google has the wrong hours. The security guard just told me that you have to be in before 4:00pm to get service at this location. (Even though they close at 5:00pm?)

So, 4:30 is too late evidently...</Review>

I broke the hinge on my glasses, couldn't afford to lose a vintage Ray-Ban frame, I walked in paid $20 for replacing the hinge and adjust the screw,.
I Strongly recommend Paul Gross Eyeglass repair. It was worth the 40 miles I had to drive<//Review>

Didn’t know what to do with my broken frame glasses, and this place magically fixed it for just 15 mins ( might be even less). Very nice and friendly service with reasonable price. I am so happy, my glasses looks like it had never been broken.</text>

Fast, honest, knowledgeable service! I was on a trip and my glasses broke in half. I needed a new prescription so I figured I would try to have them fixed so I could see my Dr. At home for a new pair. We found Paul gross on Google and decided to give him a try based on his reviews. It was the best decision ever.
He said he could fix them but it would leave a little visible damage but since I needed new glasses anyhow it didn't matter to me. He called us very soon after we left to say he could not weld the frames as he had thought because my frames were titanium, but that he had found a new frame that the lenses fit into and they were ready to pick up. The frames were almost pefectly sized and worked great to finish out our trip. Plus it only cost $27. Overall we were amazed at his ingenuity and pleased with his service.
Give him a try, you will be glad you did.<//text>

<rate>5< /rate><review>I had just broken my last pair of glasses and was finally forced to drive the 25 minutes to give these guys a chance.  Both of my pairs of glasses were pricy (one metal frame and one wire rim).  Both had broken a couple of times before and I had to push my optometrist to repair them, as they were under warranty.  After the second time, she said that she wouldn't repair them again.  After about a year, they had both broken again. I took them to Paul and he fixed both of them, including supplying a new temple piece, in about 30 minutes for about $45.  This place is fantastic!< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

Wow, there's cheap and cheerful. And then there's affordable and amazing and Paul Gross Eyeglass Repair is both! Very quick repair and Paul is an expert with a delightfully dry sense of humor. Be sure to bring cash, no plastic accepted.<//Review>

The other reviews here are actually true. He took like 5 minutes or less and charged $5 bucks for fixing a leg that nearly looked bent without repair to me. I even tried him giving him a $5 tip but he refused. I think I'll definitely go to him for all my future eyeglass needs. And the butterscotch candies by the magazines are a plus.<//review>

I asked businesses around me for help, but they all turned me away without a second glance. They told me I had to buy new eyeglasses, but it takes time and thousands of dollars to order custom glasses. I came across Paul Gross Eyeglass Repair, and Mr. Gross readily agreed to the repair for a mere $32. It was done in just three hours. I am very grateful and extremely satisfied with the repair. The technicality is exceptional, and it looks as good as new.<//review>< Rate>

<Text>Fast, expert service. I had a screw fall out, and got it repaired quickly for a reasonable price. A customer before me had sunglasses repaired, and Mr Gross took the time to point out that because of the frame style, the repair would not hold up in the long term. I appreciate that attention to detail, as did the customer.

A previous reviewer noted that any hobby person could do similar repairs, but it is not that easy to find a hobby person who you know will reliably do the job.< /Text><username>OC Alexander<//username><Rating>5</Rating>< Time>

Drove like 30 minutes but it was all worth it. Thank you Paul Gross for fixing my glasses. Barley when I was about to take out my phone,  "Ready"... my glasses were fixed.  It took him less than 5 min. Great service and  also excellent prices. Highly recommended.< /Review>

<Text>While away working I broke not one but three pairs of glasses. I got back home to LA and tried to find a frame repair place. One pair of glasses in particular were damaged (I thought) beyond repair. Paul got to work and in a matter of an half hour he made me the happiest man!!! This is my place now and I highly recommended it to All and any... totally worth the drive !!!</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

I went there because the legs of my glasses were loose. He fixed them but ended up damaging both of the lenses. I got my refund of $5 but I had to pay out of pocket $180 for this stunt. According to him this has only happened 4 times out of 20 years. My advice is please let your customers know this can happen when you are applying heat to their frames. I accepted your apology but that was no way to conduct business and you know this in your heart. I will not come back again as I can’ t afford to loose money on your “No refunds on work done on glasses if something goes wrong” This is not how a business should operate. Best of luck to you all<//Review>

Fixed my bent frames in less than 10 min saved me a ton of money over getting new frames. Every other place told me they would break if they tried and to just buy a new pair. Would make the long drive again for any of my glasses repair needs.< /text>

My eye glasses broke while on vacation and thougt I would miss out on family time, So I looked on line for eyglass repair and found tam. How lucky was I. I was met with a smile and in less than ten minuets I was back on the road. It took me more time to write this review than to have my glasses repaired. WOW! THANK YOU TAM!

<review>Paul is polite, funny, efficient, does great work and his prices are as if you stepped onto the set of Mayberry RFD.
I highly recommend Paul Gross when you need eyeglass repairs.< /review>< pictures>

I had the screw break in the hinge of my glasses...took it to 3 different spots only to be told it wasn't worth fixing. I was recommended to Paul by another store...he fixed them in 20 minutes and I paid about the price of a movie ticket...love this place<//Text>

"For the price, and worksmanship, it is not a big deal! Its very average, any hobby person with hobby tools can do this type of repair!"

True, but try finding a hobby person that will get it done in the same amount of time.<//Review>

This is not a real Verizon store, just a retailer who wants to sell you phones and not service on your account. Horrible customer service< /Text>

This place is awesome! I'm always in and out in less than 10 minutes. They do a great job on my eyebrows and I've never been disappointed in the 5 times I've been here.</Review>

< Review>
I have been recently working on growing out my brows. I felt like lately the lady I have been going to has been threading them too thin. I was in the area and had some extra time and I came across moon threading on yelp/google. They had good reviews so I decided to go in. I forgot her name but it was the older woman who did my brows. She did one eyebrow and asked me to check and she explained was leaving certain hairs so that they can continue to grow out and make my brows fuller. I am really happy with how my brows came out they look a lot fuller.  I am from out of the area but I will wait to get my brows done here just because she took the time to do my brows instead of rushing and making them too thin.<//Review>

<Text>The Vet, Dr Emily Bloom was extremely good.  It was a late emergency visit; got us in quick, she was brilliant and very personable, told us what was going on, (great news this time), impeccable advice, and my Pit mix adored her. I'm telling you, it was a very pleasant experience.<//Text>< user_id>

Every time we take our pets to Broadway Animal Hospital
The staff members always very nice, we don't worry when
we leave our pets with them because we know that they are in good hands
Our pets always very happy to go in and when they come out they're happier.
So happy that they can't even wait to get back in the truck, but somehow
I don't think they want to go back anytime soon.<//review>

<review>When Dr. LOCHTIE ran it, there were options that didn't include a tooth checkup estimate of $1700. GREAT guy! I understand that Vets go through the same training as YOUR M.D., but that was their choice.<//review>< Resp>

They always do their best.
COVID has made many things more stressful and the veterinary business is no different. I can say with confidence that every associate there, even though they are under an increased amount of stress, has the best of intentions for pets and clients in their hearts.
Your pets are in loving and skilled hands at BAH. The Doctor care is top notch, and everyone from receptionists, to vet assistants and cleaning staff give 100% towards caring for pets every day.</review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x54d4000d8c00fadd:0xefed0ca30a1459cc</gmap_id></record>

Every encounter we have had with Broadway Animal Hospital has been stellar.  They consistently provide compassionate, attentive care to our pets.   We have also used their Cosy Cat Cottages and were very pleased.   We highly recommend them.< /Review>

<Review>Vet's took care of my kitty amazingly. Through the pandemic, contact was kept minimal. The appointment was done while we sat in the parkinglot with our Kitty inside, over the phone. The doctor was amazing and Gabe is tons of insight as to what was bother her, explaining it perfectly. Very nice and friendly staff too!< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

I can't say enough about the people at Broadway Animal Hospital. Every time I take one of my "fur babies" in everyone that works there are so kind and always answer any questions I have . They are very professional and really care about me and my babies. I also had to let one of my cats cross the rainbow bridge and they were so caring and helped me through it. I wouldn't go anywhere else <3< /Text>

<Text>👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
The way these folks go about helping you is how the process of taking care of your companion creature should be, ALWAYS. They're actually there to help and not just take your money....
AMAZING CONCEPT 👌
From the moment you walk through the front door you know you're in good hands just from the vibe. Friendly staff, awesome location and on top of all that (one more time) they try to help your Lil buddy, instead of just trying to hurt your wallet.
THANKS TO EVERYONE THERE 😊

PS. KODIAK would like a different flavor of comfortis😋</Text>< name>

As review and taking time after being concern about my service dog health. I believe B.A hospital has done everything they can but they been there when I had emergencies care. I love the kind staff and Dr. Flores if I said it right. I would love to continue working with B.A hopital future. I hope to find out by another vet what going on with my service dog. But B.A hospital does a good service.</Text>

We have ruled out many common problems. Unfortunately further diagnostics are needed and do cost more and becomes frustrating. We have tried to offer inexpensive solutions, but found you have not picked a written prescription we offered, and did not hear back from you after making another recommendation. I hope that you do get a second opinion as that will be what is best for Max Little Bear. Good luck, as it is our hope that he gets well and stays well.'}<//Resp>

I go in once a month for my cat's flea meds, and whenever she needs a shot or her claws trimmed. Love the staff here, they're courteous, professional and care as much about your pets as you do. Plus they have a really cute office cat that you can see sometimes, lounging behind the counter.</Review>

Had to put my beloved 25 year old cat Billy down. Broadway Animal Hospitals staff and Drs were very kind and compassionate! I would recommend them to anyone looking for the best animal care in town! Trust me when I say in 25 years I have been to all vets in town. This place deserves 10 stars! Way more affordable than the rest! And top of the line care! Thank you Broadway Animal Hospital!

The Vets and Staff at Broadway Animal Hospital have been very good to me and my three dogs. I went through two life altering surgeries with one of my dogs and received great support. I had to put down my very old lady and  it was as much as possible made easy... was supported throughout with kind  words and actions.</Review>

I have a very anxious rescue cat who hates the vet (and pretty much everyone else). At 13, he had to have some extensive dental work. Broadway Animal Hospital was very good with him and didn't force him to interact other than what they needed to treat him. They were responsive to a slight complication, staying late to address it. Cat is doing great.<//Review>

From the front office to the technical staff we are always greeted with a smile and they remember who you are. Very impressive. If and when you need help with your furbabies Broadway Animal Hospital is the place for you. I can thank them enough for all they do.

I worked with two vets during this time, and I could feel how much they cared about my little guy right up until the end. It’ll be a long time, but I can’t wait to see this office again when I’m ready to have another kitty in my life 🐱❤️
Many thanks to Broadway, from me and baby Mista!</Review>< rate>

Great facility. My friends gave this vet a bad rap but the rumors were wrong. They take care and time with my animals. They made me, my cat and my boyfriend who was clearly freaking out for his kitty, feel at ease. Awwmazing. They gave me clear care instructions and even called me with follow ups to check in on my sweet kitty. Fairly priced and great customer service. i even had kitty  emergencies and they got me in ASAP. I really appreciate the care you guys took. thank you so much for caring for my sparrow & EB< /review>

I don't often write reviews but this Vet was the best I have ever seen with a dog. I am 63 so that's saying a lot. Dr. Tavares calmed my Zoey in a matter of min. and in her 6 years she has never been calm with a Vet. The staff at Broadway Animal Hospital is always the best, nice and helpful as well. Thank you,

<Review>Recently our beloved dog became extremely sick. Broadway Animal Hospital gave him the very best care. They told us from the start that he may not make it but together we developed a plan to try and save him. They worked with him for 2 months until it became clear he was in pain and there was no cure. Together we decided it was time to euthanize our best buddy who had been part of our family for the past 12 years. They were kind and considerate and helped us through this terrible time. I cannot recommend them enough.<//Review>< Pictures>

The staff, Vet. Tech and the Dr are kind, compassionate, and really care about their patients and their mommies and daddies. They break down all care and procedures even a layman can understand. I would trust my little Dobby-Doo with them under any circumstance. I highly recommend Broadway Animal hospital to all .</review>

I got my first cat at age 12 and  am now 70 so I've been to a lot of vets over the years.  I now have 2 dogs and three cats.. Broadway Animal Hospital has their act together. Front desk people, techs, doctors...they all are professional and courteous. I get call-backs checking on my pets and the vets call themselves to talk over the treatment plan. Estimates are always given prior to treatment. And they will work to get "patients of record" in for emergencies for a nominal fee increase. The Best!</review>

Really nice staff and doctor. We're very kind and helpful. Our dog had an ear infection when we got him. Broadway animal hospital was the only local vet willing to get him in to be seen in a timely fashion at a good price. Highly recommend this place for your fur baby. They helped us when no one else would. Very compassionate vet.<//text>

I have a newborn and I found worms on one of my cats. I was really concerned to get this taken care of immediately. I called and they were able to see my cats the same day!! And when I checked out the front desk techs werethe best because they were super knowledgeable and helpful and saved me from having to buy meds twice!! Thank you so much! For being so nice patient and knowledgeable!!< /Review>

<Review>We did get great care I have to say and staff was cordial.
Not to long ago, after going thru an illness with our little cat and eventually having to make the tough decision to put him to sleep, a decision that was excruciating for us, you know we never received a card or note of condolences, just gladly took our money and that was the end of that. May seem silly but good grief.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

I love Broadway animal hospital. The staff that work the are all very professional but personable as well. My beloved Tassawar had been very sick in Nov of 2018 and Dr. Flores took excellent care of hi and explained everything to me regarding tests, etc. They all took good care of my baby. Unfortunately, on May 22nd Tassawar crashed( kidney disease and another unknown factor) and he got in immediately without the usual wait. I had to make the heart breaking decision to help him cross as he was failing quickly. Dr. Folden and staff comforted us both and let me stay with my baby and spend as much time as I wanted with him before and after he crossed. It wasn't easy but that extra care helped me come to terms with knowing it was the right decision I had to make for Tassawar. Broadway Animal hospital is the only place I will take my four footed babies. I know they treat each one as they would if they were their own. Thank you for loving Tassawar<//text>

< review>
I was able to get my dog seen the same day I called since they had a cancellation. I took my 14 month old dog here suspecting hip dysplasia and Dr Flores said it probably was, but without X-Rays it’s impossible to confirm. What I really appreciated is that she wasn’t pushy about doing further treatment in house. I asked her if we did confirm it with X-ray what the surgical options are and since those options wouldn’t be a guarantee of health and are amazingly expensive I opted to go with Cosequin and an NSAID. She was very gentle with myself and my boy. He’s since then feeling better on the medication.</review>

<Time>1452908584202< /Time><rating>5<//rating><text>I am always extremely cautious with finding a new vet to care for my dogs. I moved to Eureka to attend HSU and decided to give these guys a shot. I took my 14 y/o diabetic, blind and deaf dog in for a check up and was very satisfied with their care. The vet was a sharp woman who knew what she was doing. Most of the negative reviews I have seen posted are not seeming to understand the standard procedures and billing methods that take place at most vets. Having worked in this industry, I can say that Dr. Jennifer Tavares is a bright, friendly and quite competent veterinarian! The vet techs were also very kind.

The pricing was appropriate for the visit. Medication is always expensive, so that I understand. And they were happy to write a script to be filled elsewhere and make calls to assist in getting a compound from a cheaper place too. They did not try to get me to do any unneeded work and were considerate to my dog's age and fragility.

I would highly recommend giving them a chance. Good care and reasonable cost.< /text>< pics>

<Review>Broadway animal hospital rocks. I've been taking my old tater tot there for most of her life. I recently had to take Ducky in for an ear infection. I called at 9:15am on Monday morning and got an appointment for 9:30am the same day. The front desk staff is always friendly and professional, making this trip no exception. We got to see Dr. Folden, and Ducky loves Dr. Folden. Being grumpy and independent, Ducky does not like to be handled with anything but the utmost concern for her comfort, and she lets Dr. Folden pick her up with nary the slightest complaint.
The veterinary technician was helpful and gentle with my pupper, too.
When we left we had a solid treatment plan to ensure that Ducky recovered swiftly.
Of course all of this did cost me money but I think, relative to the service, it was very reasonably priced. They don't push expensive services that aren't necessary, and will give written prescriptions in the event that you want to get your medications through other pharmacies. They didn't charge me any special fees for having gotten me in so swiftly, and the time spent with the doctor and technician wasn't rushed either. Two thumbs up.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<review>My normal vets office is in arcata. When my pet stopped breathing and I had to give him mouth to mouth I called my normal vet said I was on my way with an emergency. ..the girl on the phone said...oh okay well try to get you in but it could be awhile!!! So I took him here instead. They were super nice got him right in even though we had never been here before.  Everyone was understanding and kind and for being a non patient with an emergency the price was very fair. Think I found his new vet.<//review>< Pictures>

I found Dr. Otto and Dr. Tsdarvos to be very caring, kind, and gentle towards my dogs.  All treatments and associated costs were clearly communicated to me and any questions I had were answered honestly in a way that I could understand.  I also really liked the office staff and vet assistants who were all very friendly and caring.

I am extremely thankful to have found a local veterinarian's office that I can trust with my little furry friends.  Thank you Broadway Animal Hospital!</text>< Pictures>

<Review>I would have left 0 stars but there was  no choice i called them and about Every other vet around from McKinnleyville to Fourtuna. No one was willing to see her or  had an appointment. (Theres only a few Drs. That see rats)The girl at the front said they would for a emergancy charge.  I had a baby rat in distress. Yes they would see her for 150 some dollars for a emergancy visit! I am a single parent with 6 kids. When i told her i couldnt afford that, all she could say was "Well all the other vets are $200.00 or above!!   I would be willing to pay an office visit of course! But almost $200 just to walk in the door without treatment or med, I couldnt afford it! I had No Other options. Well Thank you Brodway anmial hospital, my baby rat Delilah, died a Slow Agonizing death from the bloat. I understand your out to make money but seems like your Love for  the $$ out ways your Love for the 🐀. I just have 1 question for you and your staff.......How do you sleep at nite???
I just hope I Never have to meet you All Ever in the future. And when someone asks me if i know a Good vet, ill remember my 4 week old baby rat pup bloating and gasping for air And Not Recommend   you At All!!</Review>< pics>

<date>1407164887834<//date><review>I have to agree that the service was horrible more than a year ago. The owner then milked it for everything he could, had unqualified vets working there.

The new owners from Ferndale are the best. Dr. Adrienne Otto is the best. She has always taken wonderful care of my two cats and two beagles. They have been able to re-arraign their schedules when it was necessary for Suze to have cancerous tumors removed, and Maxx had an abnormal growth on his neck.

The charges are reasonable.

Chris and Rick, the vet techs, are absolutely the best.

I took my beautiful 2 year old rottweiller with a vomiting issue to this place. They wanted to keep her overnight to put her on antibiotics (she had milk in her boobs and no pups because she just had a period... the milk was infected, duhh)  and take care of her.I paid up front and trusted them with my beautiful rottweiller. She was exited and lively, she was just throwing up a couple days. Later that evening she was anxious the vets told us when we called after hours.The next morning they called to tell me she DIED!!  The owner of the clinic argued with me telling me she got septic and died overnight, with IV antibiotics in her. It takes more than just a few hours to kill a anxious and energetic  2 year old rottie with a septic infection. My heart is so pained and the vets won't even admit what they did. I would bet everything on the fact they sedated her and her airway collapsed. This is common when big dogs get sedated. I know she was anxious and I know she cries (howls) when she is separated from her family. To top it all off the owner was rude beyond belief, even insulting me a couple times. So not only was my companion ignorantly killed, the owner insulted me to boot. All this cost over $900 for them to do to our family.
PLEASE do not take your animals to these vets, take it from my broken heart.
Please do not put your animals in the hands of incompitent vets.</Text>

<Text>Not great customer service.  I needed to return 4 boxes of equipment.  I asked for some help as I had badly hurt my right wrist.  I learned that "they are not required" to assist customers with boxes -Cody.  Even though there were 4 people working without any other customers but myself.   However, thankful for Lorena who did offer some help (a bag to carry the boxes) and even DID assist me due to my twisted wrist!  She met me near the door as she saw I couldn't carry the 4th box anymore.  Thanks Lorena!< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

We were supposed to have 400 mbps , but always had like 30 . They sent me to collections for the final bill with in a ridiculously short amount of time. Switched to frontier and am usually getting 300-400 mbps for cheaper too! Besides for the bad connection,  you really see their true colors when you cancel!!< /Review>

Unfortunately after 2 trips down there and 3 attempts these people cannot seem to hook up a brand new Unlocked Google Pixel 5.

Spectrum has only bugged me for the last year and a half to get their service And I'm not sure I want it anymore, at least I don't have to sign a contract!<//review>

<Review>This company is terrible! Its been THE WORST customer service experience I. HAVE. EVER. HAD.  I dont mean recently either. I mean this is the worst customer service Ive ever had in my entire life.  No one knows anything, orders get cancelled or resubmitted without explanation staff offers lots of "what i think might've happened..."  and "I can't see anything in my system". These should be their company slogan.

Avoid Spectrum mobile unless you enjoy wasting time and not getting any resolution.  My credit is good, i have money to pay for it, I provided the documention asked, then they cancelled my order and resubmitted...then cancelled again but told me it was on the way.<//Review></record>

<review>Vincent and his partner were excellent! They took time to fix all the issue that were caused by "others" setting up my new service. I would have been very upset  with Spectrum of I hadn't gone into the store because alot of things were not right.<//review>< pics>

This is how it works with a monopoly. They truly don’t care. Until 5G gets real traction. When 5G last-mile comes, bye, bye Spectrum. The CEO will be fired, but he doesn’t care, he’s cashing out right now by saving money on customer support.<//review>< pictures>

I went to change mobile accounts from at and t to spectrum mobile. A person named GLORIA tried to help us. I can only say tried because she could not get out of her own way. She could not answer the simplest of questions. She even could not read the serial number on my phone. Yes I said she could not READ!? She asked me and then my wife to read the number to her. We wasted about 45 minutes trying to get the switch made but Gloria would go down one path, get stuck and would retrace and get stuck again. I am retired and have time on my hands but I finally gave up and stormed out. This office is a disgrace. GLORIA was extremely slow and had no “affect”;  she might have been a mannequin but now I think of it, I don’t remember seeing her blink.     AVOID AT ALL COST!!< /review>

<Review>I drove from Calabasas to TO because I needed to get a prior bill printed out because I misplaced my bill, I was unable to login into the website and I was not going to hold for a rep for 1 hour on the phone, I walked into the store said what I needed. I was told by I believe was the manager at that time Cody Ramirez, he told me they do not print out bills and he could not assist with my login problems, told me to call support, this was after I drove about 20 miles to get there. Worst customer service.< /Review>< Pics>

<text>Terrible service there was over 16 people in line. There was three people working and only two actually working.Two people on one cashier post Chatting to the customer about the sons age instead of helping other customers was in there 45 minutes and the line didn’t move once. No wonder cables a dying business. It’s ridiculous to have to wait over an hour to return equipment. It all could be fixed with better scheduling on their busiest days and employees actually want to work. You know it’s bad when there’s a palpable disgust. I wasn’t even in there for myself I was helping my grandmother who can’t make it to the store. So glad I’m not an actual customer.< /text>< Time>

<time>1566672211740<//time><Rate>1< /Rate><text>Pleased that there was no wait. Haven't had problems in the past, but service was subpar today.  We came in back in July, a week after our service month started, and downgraded our plan. We were not informed of the changes in policy, which supposedly happened on June 23rd, that stated that Spectrum no longer pro-rates their bills. We walked in today attempting to ask about our bill. Customer service could not provide us with a copy of the Terms of Service in the store. They basically told us to retrieve it ourselves from the Spectrum website at home. We'd like to recommend that the staff be better trained in customer service, be up front about policy changes to ensure customers are fully aware especially as customers make changes to their plans, and have important documents such as Terms of Service available in the store.<//text><pics>None<//pics><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

Very expensive. A lot of the channels are either broken up or unavailable. Frustrating to try to reach a real person. I have been dealing with unwatchable channels off and on for 2 months now. I would not recommend.< /review>

Absolutely absurd for a company to have a location at the mall on a weekend and have only 2 employees staffed for the day. 15 people signed in and 30 minutes with each customer. Longer than 1 hour wait... so happy to not have service with them any longer. Horrible!</Text>

The two persons who are supposed to help customers are at the far end of the store. I was the only customer there. I walked up to the desk. The lady told me to walk back to the entrance to sign in without saying where the sign in sheet was. I looked around and saw there was a little tablet. I typed in my name and waited 40 minutes. I'm glad that I will not be working with Spectrum much longer.<//review>

Be careful when you get phone service from Spectrum. They share your information with third parties, phone number and address. If you don't want this information shared then you have two options - pay $1.99/month for private number or get a post office box. None of this information is given to you when you sign up for their service.<//review>

Terrible customer service, spotty internet, absurdly expensive. I have never had a worse time with any other internet service, and of course there are virtually no other internet providers in the area and they know it so they charge whatever they want. Price keep rising for less than medocre internet. As soon as i find any other internet provider in my area i'm leaving.<//Text>

<Text>The service was very good and we appreciated the representative that we had. But their prices are still very very high and they charge you for every piece of equipment that goes into your house. It's the add-ons and the packages that kill you plus the fact that it's not really $29 it' a mandatory $29X3 for the bundling then add on the equipment. YIKES!<//Text>< Pictures>

No cable or internet due to the fires they said. That means they have no redundancy backups in place. Ridiculous how much money everyone pays and no refunds given for outages. 0 stars.< /text>

<review>Prices high, decent customer service, unrelable sales staff. Update: I recently had to wait about two hours to return two cable boxes to their lavish store, which had one very slow employee on duty. I returned the boxes because I'm no longer getting channels from Spectrum. Gone to Hulu, saving $100 a month and getting service more to my liking.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

<rating>1<//rating><Review>I got Direct TV in March and called Spectrum 2 weeks later to downgrade my service to internet only. I found out today that they've been charging me the full price for the last 7-months - about $500. I got on the phone with one of their representatives, Nany, who's a "specialist" - she offered to buy out my Direct TV package, which I have no interest in, and which wouldn't get me my $500 back. She said they had a phone call from me on my record going back to April 3 - to their "phone repair" division. I haven't had a regular non-cellular phone since before the Iphone came out. I asked Nany if she really thought that on April 3rd that I randomly called their phone repair division - or if it was more plausible/non-insane, that I am not lying and that I called to downgrade my service. She said they don't have notes that go back over 6-months and too bad. At least she was polite while she was taking part in working with Spectrum on stealing $500 from me. Maybe I should have given 1.5 stars.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

Stay away from Time Warner what ever you do. I just moved to the area, and never have dealt with Time Warner, I should have read the reviews, but my god, this is the worst company ever, I had them come out to fix an issue from the first day the set up and the came to the door and didn't knock but called, and left, WTF, so they were suppose to reschedule for the next morning, and the guy came, couldn't get in the box, i told him to come in so i could call and get it opened for him, he waited out the door and the guy left, who does that, So after dealing with all this crap I just canceled, then they wanted to charge me to have them pick up the box, really? no customer service what so ever, Don't USE TIME WARNER EVER!!!< /text>

Too If you have At&t phone service on your mobile phone , go to their stor and check out Direct tv & what great package deals they have and get a FREE Roku box and then you will have to either get your own modem or use one from another cable company whether Comcast or TWC-Spectrum with DVR box ? Or if needed a Internet WiFi modem ! If you have a smart tv  your better off than with an older version tv that’s only HD not smart tv! Splurge on s smart Tv and get a lot more perks ! Be choosy!! No contracts for any company !  Or if you have a better idea please share it!!< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Took 3 technicians and two weeks to finally hook up my service, if that's what you want to call it. I call it intermittent shenanigans. From the start, our service would cut out every 10 minutes and take another ten to come back. I had at least 5-10 different technicians come to our house, giving us different answers every time. Your frequency needs adjusting...  Ok adjust it. Nothing changed. Your MBPS are too low...  Ok, lets upgrade. Nothing changed. Oh, this filter on your Coax is affecting connection...  Ok, take it off. Nothing changed. Oh, where is your filter for the Coax? You need that...  Ok, put it back on. Nothing changed. I even had one of there technicians tell me that their routers are known to be a problem, that I should buy my own and return theirs...  Ok, I'll do that. Nothing changed. The last guy told me my baby monitor was affecting our service...  Seriously. Spectrum is a joke. I would advise going elsewhere to save yourself the frustration and days of waiting for technicians, hours waiting for your TV to start playing your shows, or internet for your laptops and phones.  Thank you for the headache Spectrum. You don't deserve the one star, I had to give you that to post.</Text>

I guess they are monopolized in Thousand Oaks area, and they can really treat customer like shhhh.. I am a long time customer since 1999, but when I saw that they drop their rate, they would not allow existing customer to change to the new rate.  They said only for new customers.  So, if I cancel my existing service, then I can sign up the rate?  You would think that if you are a long term customer TWC would treat you a little better, but they treat your worst.

<Text>Wow, what can I say. I wish I had read these reviews long ago before contracting with TWC. Appalling customer service, that is if you can reach them at all. 4 calls to them this week, average wait time before I gave up---18.5 minutes. I never got through except when I called a number I gleaned on the internet, but the guy I got wasn't empowered to do anything. I have left e-mails, messages and complaints with anyone I could come in contact with but it's like hollering into a well. Just don't have anything to do with TWC is my advice. Hell, I'm just trying to cancel service and stop the bills. I will now try dumping my equipment off at one of their offices. I bet they're real freak shows--I can't wait.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Paul...Field Tech II  just decided to BLOW his appt he had with me off...no phone call...NO KNOCK on my  OPEN DOOR...Just cancelled my appt.
While I expect NOTHING from this company I PAY a TON to every month for MANY MANY YEARS!!!
I would like for this PAUL guy to Loose his job.  that will be just about the ONLY thing they can do to keep me as a customer ( not that they care at all) .

I have put a request in to speak to the district manager ...and we will see if he wants to keep me as a customer ( At Least he WILL hear about his Lacky employee..that ON his OWN decides to just CANCEL customers appointments....but I Guess only Their time is Important...Not a crummy little customer's time ( As PAUL just proved.

we pay over $200.00 a month....I feel it's time to find another company that APPRECIATES my Loyalty and $$$$......last straw with TWC....<//text>

TWC in Newbury Park at 2323 Teller Rd. is possibly the worst distribution point in the entire TWC system. The manager is obviously a complete moron and is never made to answer for his lack of supervision. He/she hires incompetent people to maintain the cable distribution system at 2323 Teller Road and several times per month the one night-shift employee that this pathetic manager puts on night-shift somehow falls asleep exactly when the system crashes!!!! And of course there's no phone number for the back room so we can call and wake the #$%*er up!!! Every time internet service crashes, there is at least a 3 hour wait for the night employee to wake up, reboot the system, and then of course TWC denies that any problem ever occurred. One night recently (around 10:00 pm) after our internet service went out, I called the Kansas control center for TWC phone support (I live in California!!!) and the operator insisted he had no outage reported in my area. I hung up and called right back, this time I got a different operator and demanded he check for reported outages in my area and sure enough, there it was!!! What a horrible company!!!

TWC has consistently published profit figures of greater than 93%!!!!!!!!! I find that number to be mind boggling, but it has been verified by several online watchdog groups that read all the corporate releases and profit statements. Amazing how so many people in America are willing to let a greedy bunch of losers steal all our money under false pretenses!! Thank god for Citizens United, The Supreme Court and greedy, corrupt, republican politicians who love the huge campaign donations from criminal enterprises like TWC... Welcome to America, now please pass the Google Fibre!!!< /review>< pictures>

I cannot stand Time Warner Cable.  It is so frustrating that they have a monopoly for cable TV and internet in the Thousand Oaks area.  They are overpriced and their customer service is terrible.  I just spent 30 minutes on the phone with someone that could hardly speak English.  Every single simple question that I had took about 30 seconds for a response.  It infuriates me that you cannot locate a basic description for the costs of basic services such as HD set top box, DVR box rental, DVR service -- but instead are forced to call them up or sift through promotional crap.  Where is the Department of Justice Anti-trust Division for cable monopolies?  Oh, that's right, they are too busy going after Apple for lowering the price of e-books.  What a joke.<//Text>

You do not go here because it is fun - you go because you need to and don't want to wait for a service truck. The office is functional but be prepared to wait your turn.<//Review>

<text>what a greedy conniving company.  Upcharge, oversell a product that they don't really have.  They advertise fast internet but it's anything but.  In honesty, my t-mobile data plan is faster than the TWC poop they call high speed.  It's been a stressfull experience to get on the internet and see a a bunch of spinning dials waiting to connect to sites.

I've had enough.  switching back to a lesser evil.  Verizon.  Sure they overcharge because they can, but their product works.  TWC commercials bash DSL but the truth is, their cable internet gets sucked dry if there's multi-users. Evidently, the area i'm in, TWC allots a grossly insufficient line for the potential users. Everyone suffers.  At least with DSL, my line, everyone's line in theory is dedicated.  Good riddance TWC and your $200+ monthly bill for basic cable, showtime and internet.  What a rip off.<//text>< Pics>

When the rep answered he placed me back on hold to check on how to have my address changed.  When he came back he asked me if he could help me transfer my service address.  I told him once again that I only wanted to change my billing address. He notified me at that time that I would have to physically go to my local TW location and change my billing address.  After wasting 40 minutes of my time he proceeded to offer me several different promotions to save me money.. only he confused himself describing them to me, leaving me frustrated and upset.  This company is in need of a serious overhaul.
Dont bother with service the promotion savings arent worth the frustation and they always get you in end when your promotion expires.</Text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

My service goes out about every 4 days. Last time I called I got a smart-ass that told me to try paying my bill. I said I've never in 30 years received a late notice or had anything turned off...he said well your problem isn't ours cause nobody else has called.</review>

I wasted almost 10 minutes navigating the voice command system to find a live person. His database took about 4 minutes to find a number, outside the local area code. Unfortuneately, he gave me the phone number for the water district 10 miles away. Other TWC offices have local phone. What gives? These guys sell phone services. Can't they hook up a phone for their own darn office?<//Text>< pics>

<username>Michael Roberts<//username><response>None<//response><Text>The best kosher market in orange county by far!!! Many markets claim to be kosher because they carry a few things. O.C. Kosher is the real deal!! They have a wonderful selection of everything, a great meat counter and their potpies are truly incredible!! And... Their staff is friendly, beyond helpful and they even package an entire week of meals for you. Walk in, it's all labeled kosher and boxed beautifully!! Incredible market!!<//Text>< userid>

<review>Monday 31 May.

It was okay for the area. The food average tasting okay, but Not like what I am use to in other Israel restaurant in Southern California where the waiters, waitresses and cooks are Israeli Jews.

And of course in God's country, Israel the all the food is the best, but in N. America, they come close as they can,  but the best in California in my opinion are in Burbank and Tarzana.</review>< Gmap_id>

We  added this place in our phone list  and we shall surely go again very soon. We highly recommend.< /Review>

Great hospitality and all meats are Kosher. Small, centralized and on the South end of the shopping center closest to the 5 fwy. Clean, personalized and location in Old Town Tustin.< /Review>

<Review>For me, this is the best place to purchase an affordable yet good quality of goods and everything. The place is air-conditioned and is very accomodating for large groups of people. A lot of good stuff for a very reasonable price. The parking condition of this place is also very amazing and impressive. Highly recommended!<//Review>< Response>

< Review>
If I could rate less I would!!! The cashier was demeaning & treated me like I was worth dirt! There’s no social distancing & no markings of where the check out line starts. I got behind the lady in front of me since there was no one else. After looking me over with a smile on his face decided to let two other wealthy looking women go first who had lined up behind me. The other cashier ignored me! I decided after picking up my wife’s (which the first cashier gave a look of disgust over)order that I wouldn’t be placing the additional ones for my friends, family and businesses that I work with and out back the items I had planned on getting. They are rude and homophobic!!!<//Review>

I think a sandwich from Ralphs would have been better and at half the price. There was barely any meat, you get like a one bite size portion of macaroni salad, and the pickle was sour like a Dill pickle. I like a good Deli pickle and this was the worse.

One of the workers had his mask off behind the deli counter when he thought nobody would see him. For a local Kosher sandwich I'll stick to Benjie's or head to L.A.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Clean small kosher shop.
However the takeout was not so fresh (the rice seemed to be a few days old) and most of the products are overpriced (6 jelly donuts for 12$)<//review>

My friend and I ordered pastrami from the deli. We were excited to try kosher meats, a rare find for us. The store is small but has a nice variety of meats and the staff was mostly nice.

However, be warned if you are non-Jewish you will be faced with very judgmental people. Many people gave us hard stares and looked at us up and down constantly. As if to say “why are you here, eating our meats?” Quite an unexpected greeting when we came to happily support a small shop.

One woman also shooed us back when we were walking down the aisles (we were def 6 feet apart at that time and it was just so rude). Elitist mentality and will not be supporting again. I recommend supporting local shops that welcome all, not just their own.<//Text>

<review>What a transformation. So many wonderful food choices. Individual packaginging great for singles, stop and go meals for lunch and smaller portions for senior appetites. Always well stocked and the cooked food is delish !!! Tov todah OCKosher. Baruk Hashem.</review>< pics>

I like this spot! They prepare great food, their menu is nice, The chief cook in that place is a real authority in the kitchen, I like very much tasting all their food. The dishes are consistently tasty, the attitude towards the clients  is friendly. I visit often this restaurant and I not even once was unsatisfied. I recommend it with no hesitation.</review>

It's stamped 10k but doesn't even register at 5k. Even the diamond is not real. I'm furious at Kmart. Whatever you do, DO NOT SHOP HERE!!! Go anywhere else. If they're selling bogus jewelry, saying it's real, they're capable of anything.< /text>< Pics>

Staff is helpful.  Usually a wait on lines.  Low price merchandise.  You can send money through western union here.  You must bring cash for that service.< /Text>

<Rate>1</Rate><text>I absolutely despise this Kmart. Most of the staff here except a limited few are very unprofessional and are not very helpful or friendly. As a former Kmart employee I can tell you that you MUST greet all customers that are within eyesight or 5 feet from you. Every time I come here there is always a long line and the employees don't have a very great attitude/vibe. That is also a big no from what I was taught. You are supposed to have a great attitude and ask them if they are finding everything okay.. You are  also supposed to call for backup when there is a line of 3 or more customers in one check stand. I went there  on 9/10/16 around 5-6 pm  because my mom wanted to go and I noticed there were 4-5 female staff members just standing there talking at the service counter when they could be doing something useful. Not only that but they were announcing sales and when they were done they would hang up the phone which causes a loud click noise. FYI kmart employees there is a red button that says release on it so once your done paging you hit that button so you don't make that very annoying loud click when you hang up the phone.  I really hope a manager sees this and takes some action. I know my former managers would be ashamed to have such rude and lazy staffers. They would most likely have been fired.< /text>< pics>

< Review>
Many of the Kmart stores are messy and unpleasant to shop at, but this Kmart is clean and well organized.
The people working here are both helpful and friendly, heck they even laughed at my corny jokes.
If you want to shop at a place like this Kmart, here is the one you want.<//Review>

Needs to be redesigned, revamp itself. The floor plan is all wrong. The salesperson's are usually very friendly and helpful but very slow. It's like the entire store needs a facelift!!!!<//text>

<username>king kong< /username><date>1513379170650</date><Rate>1<//Rate><Text>Most of the employees at the K mart in Apple Valley act as if they cannot or just are blatantly not willing to help anybody find anything in the store. Then when it comes to pay for your items the lines are always too long, they always have only one register open 2 on a good day  And for whatever reason they take forever ringing each customer up  It takes between 5 and 10 minutes per transaction whether the customer has one item or 20.  I find this crazy because there is always 6 or 7  Employs wondering around aimlessly  As if the registers are just a hangout spot. Its very sickening and can ruin a good day just sitting in line at this K mart.  I tried to complain to a manager there once and she told me this whole story about "Donald Trump this" and "Donald Trump that" I'm  like donald  has nothing to do with the wait times  At the register.  Then to smooth things over she told me to give her my phone number so she can put $15 work that came our points on my phone number.(which I found insulting because I did not come go for a handout)  I am an avid K mart shopper and just because of a few bad apples that will not stop me from shopping there. I will continue to shop there because I like K mart I just wish they had better customer service.</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

Good prices and never really that busy when I go but the employees are judgemental and stereotyping...I went one time and it was cold outside so I had my hoodie up and I am walking through the store and I can see that all the employees are staring at me and I go to grab what I need and as I'm putting it in the shopping cart one of the employees that I passed when I first walked in the store asks excuse me sir do you need help finding anything I told him no I know exactly what I need and where it's at and walked away and for the next fifteen minutes he follows me up and down every aisle just straightening stuff on the shelf untill I go to the next one...Lol it was actually pretty funny how petty it was< /review>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>Might as well be called “Freddy’s”.

While there may be quite a line at times, it’s always well worth the wait. I personally have always dealt w Mr. Frederick specifically; but that’s just because he’s an absolute daisy. Any questions you may have are always answered with knowledge and reason through firsthand experience and it’s certainly a “no dumb questions” environment. Safe handling of firearms at all times plus a diverse selection of knives and gear make for honestly the best gun shop in the high desert, maybe even the world...</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<Text>Been in a few times for my firearm needs and if they don't have what you're looking for they will most certainly get it for you. Went in for a trigger for my build and we spoke about different options and upgrades I can do for when that time comes. Yeah it make get packed n busy but that cause they don't try to sell you stuff n rush you out, they'll actually sit there and talk about the firearm or parts you're looking for . Didn't feel pressured into buying something i didn't want or need like most other places I've gone to. A bit of a mark up on the price but when you take into consideration the shipping and time ..well worth it .. been waiting on a trigger for about a month from a place and they had it there for about $10 more . Will definitely be going back and recommending this place< /Text><username>Joseph Zuniga<//username><Response>None</Response><rating>5<//rating><Pics>None< /Pics></record>

<Text>This is the most knowledgeable gun shops in the high desert. They answered all my questions and were helpful in directing me to the right gun. They are also very reasonable on pricing below the average price. I went in with a budget for a hand gun and still had money left over.<//Text><UserId.>110660463343068409436<//UserId.>< date>

Extremely friendly staff and very knowledgeable with great prices to boot. Had the chance to work with Freddie regarding a purchase, although it wasn’t in stock at the time he kept me updated until day of purchase. On pick up day he took the time to run me through a couple things so I was more informed, they treat you like family here, they do not rush you, they do not upsell, and are very straightforward from beginning to end. The wait time to be helped maybe long but only because they give a lot of time and attention to each and every single customer in the store, you’ll get the same treatment when it’s your turn to be helped. Will be making all my future firearm needs here, they have a customer for life.<//Text>

It was my First time purchasing a firearm. Fred helped me out. He was patient with my questions and helped me like I was family. Both my parents have purchased firearms from Express gun locker and recommended I did the same. I'm really glad I listened. I don't see myself buying anywhere else. Great experience.

<Review>They have AR parts and some guns and items, the IG is crock they’re not that stock up, they think there the only gun store in High Desert they over price and the customer service is rude and they looked annoyed to be asked questions or buy from them I rather order my stuff online off Palmetto State Armory.com
Or go elsewhere they turner in to Turners #2 in the High Desert.
If you’re desperate this is the prefect spot for you.< /Review>< UserId.>

< review>
So I go into buy a firearm and I’m not even greeted by this old man! Everyone in there had a mean depressed look on their face. Every employee behind the counter has a huge ego trip just because they are carrying a firearm on their old hips behind the counter!

Your employee MELISSA smokes every 2 minutes and can’t even help out customers and than is smoking right at the entrance door! Hey, if you want cancer, than keep smoking! But as for me, I don’t, so stop smoking in the entrance area!

And than as I’m purchasing a firearm your employee starts the big ol subject on politics! First off I’m here for business! I don’t give one care about politics!</review>

To be honest, the Website and also the Storefront isn't the nicest one. Walk-in, and you won't be disappointed. You will find charming Folks with tons of Knowledge and a massive selection of Firearms, Parts, Accessories, and also Reloading gadgets. I always got good deals on my needs. The leading source for Firearms in the high desert.< /text>

The staff is very knowledgeable and honest about their firearms and products. They are all willing to take time to educate and help you with your purchases and investments. For those of you looking for an alternate business to support with a great staff, the Gun Locker is definitely your place. Prices are very affordable and competitive. They will always have my business before anyone else! Thank you so much Gun Locker! -CH< /Review></record>

Great place for any first time or experienced buyer. The staff is extremely courteous and helpful. My first time here the entire staff made me feel comfortable and provided me with the knowledge I needed in order to make the purchase that was suitable for myself. Prices are great as well. I definitely recommend checking them out.<//Text>

Great shop. Great customer service. Highly recommended to anyone for all your needs. They're knowledgeable. They take there time with each customer and that's worth the wait in line. I've been coming here since I've moved to the high desert 2 years ago. Rick and Fred are great. They're the ones you wanna speak too. But so is the other nice lady that works there (sorry don't know her name) she's great too. A++ 5 stars check them out you won't regret it< /review>

So I have to say that this is the most helpful, friendliest gun store I've been too. They know their stuff and actually care about their customers.  If you need any guns, ammo or accesories then I'd recommend this place in a heartbeat. Also it's a local family owned store so that's  another reason to support them.</text>

<Review>I am extremely disappointed with one of the employees. He clearly has not been train/educated on requirement for purchase of ammo. Most likely new employee that has less than 7 month of experience, he seemed confident as he was misleading customers. Well, I guess his Military and Postal Office previous experience payed off. I wasted my time of 1 and 20 minutes of standing in line. He told me that he is "...we can't sell you ammo because you need a Driver License and ID is not going to work..." And that is Fake News! So instead of trying to argue and cause I commotion and disturbance and big seen, I just went where they know their laws and regulation. I asked the employee that was assisting me multiple time hoping that one of other employees would hear his misleading statement and correct him. But employee to my left made eye contact with me and ignore the situation. Maybe he didn't want him to look bad, I can only speculate. And you might say, that I should of said something.... Well, before I was going to take my business to a different store, he made a loud announcement that made me uncomfortable. "...if your just got inline, you must have a Driver License and not ID (California Identification Card)  to make any any fire arm purchase or ammunition...if you have any question ask one of romming worker and they will do their best to facilitate..." So I went to local Wal-Mart and waited 3 minutes and got my 12 gauge with no hostel and long wait. I do like to support my local stores, but this is just plain unprofessional and wasting my time in attempt of purchasing overprice ammo. Department Manager of Wal-Mart said, "...you should't have any problems with State issued ID as long as you own a fire arm... According to California DOJ ---"Starting July 1, 2019, if you purchase ammunition and/or firearms you will be able to use a California Real ID or any other California driver license or ID as long as it does not say “Federal Limits Apply.”"--- So, if you have ID that doesn't states "Federal Limit Apply", your all set and go somewhere else or bring a book of California Department of Justice and have a group discussion! Sorry, I know this was long. Hope this helps someone.< /Review>< userid>

The staff is very helpful, very knowledgeable, and friendly. At times they get busy but they will address you even while they are helping someone. Every time I go in they have plenty of stock on ammo. The prices are reasonably priced. I inform anyone I meet to go here first. In my opinion the best in the high desert. I am not saying they honor other places price but my firearm was a little more and they adjusted to the price. They do don't force the sell and have a option to put some down and give you a  month to finish but you can't pick up till you pay off.< /review>

<text>The guys behind the gun counter have little to no knowledge on guns, the store prices are high and they can be rude. For example, ammo, targets, magazines and other shooting gear can be found much cheaper at wall mart or online. If anyone wants to buy anything from this store i would recommend to compare prices with turners, bass pro shop and ammo brothers if looking for a gun you will probably save at least 12 to 25 percent or for ammo wall mart has the best deals.<//text><user_name>Jacob Anderson< /user_name><user_id>100111099395609951209</user_id>< time>

Was looking at several guns and even though they were busy they took time to show me several different gun types and knew enough about each gun to help me make a decision. I highly recommend them for all your gun sporting needs. They also have hard to find ammo and sort of limit the sales to spread it around but don't gouge...neat. Also have tons of accessories and the connected pawn shop has a ton of stuff in it. Pretty neat looking stuff as I saw it. Highly recommend Express Gun Locker.<//Text>< Pictures>

They will not answer questions they don't know the answer to but will find a co-worker that knows. Between the 4 folks I have talked to they have covered all the questions I have asked and I had lots. As for recent comments on price, it's a buyer's responsibility to know what they should pay and a business responsibility to profit. So, do your homework, don't be a jerk and you will pay the right price.< /text>< UserId.>

Honestly a hidden gem in the HD.  A much more personable experience, I was immediately greeted and asked if I needed help.  Freddy helped my find and order exactly what I was looking for.  A far cry from turners or dicks where I stood staring at some guys for head for 20 minutes waiting to buy ammo. They have a wide variety of ammo, supplies and a great place for relaoders.</Text><Rate>4<//Rate>< Response>

Military friendly! I went here after dealing with the rude owner at High Desert Guns and Ammo. I dealt with two different guys. The first guys was honest about saying that he was new and wanted to get someone more experienced to help me. The other guy came over answered all my questions and got my paperwork done withing about a half hour. He even typed all my paperwork instead of making me wright it out. I know not everyone has good experiences but I did.< /review>

I am very dissapointed to have ever purchase a gun from this store. I purchase a hi point c9 the seller says its brand new. After I pick up the gun and disassemble it. The gun was greasy and dirty. So that means someone had already fired this pistol. Never again I will purchase something from here.</Text>

You can just tell they care about customer service.
I went to another store on an ad price and the were conveniently "Sold out" so I came here and they got close enough to the price I wanted and I loved that they spent time to explain things to me !!!</review>

Terrible service!! Had a verbal agreement with store that I will order parts through them as long as it doesnt take 2 weeks or longer to recieve items.. first item ordered,  just sitting on their shelf after waiting over a week and a half.. I cannot pick up because manager isnt their to recieve in.. total b.s.!!! They sure did have authority to take my money and leave me a message stating that my item was there and could be picked up.. Long story short.. They are over priced on everything and have zero intergrity!! Once I can finally pick up item I will never do business with these guys ever again!!!!<//Review>

I went first thing on a sat morning for a PPT. Most gun stores treat PPT's like a nucance but the little lady behind the counter treated me like a VIP customer and executed the PPT extremely efficiently and with great customer service.</Text>

Loved the food and amazing customer service, as a customer I can completely understand the stress and pressure to satisfy a customer in a short period of time. I don’t mind a small problem that can easily be fixed swiftly and happily. Employees are kind and quick. Loved everything and continue the hard work and putting up with petty customers in a professional manner.< /review>

Once again did not get what i ordered. Should have been a burger but was given egg instead. I quit going there a couple years ago because 5 of 5 orders were wrong. Decided to try again. Still wrong. Two stars because the staff were friendly and it was clean.< /text>

Jack in the box isn't what it once was, their prices have gone up too much for me , what ever happened to the 99 cent tacos? Plus they quit the Bonus Jack. Then, no more shakes like in the past, don't care much for them anymore, they got some good deals, but not enough to make me want to go there much.< /Text>

Excellent customer service. Managers always take care of the customers. I give real honest reviews so here we go. The staff and management are super friendly and when they do mess up they are always willing to fix the issue and go the extra mile. There is nothing like a restaurant that gets upset with you for their mistake. Not the case here though. Now my there are a couple of issues. Something is always down whether it be the drive thru, phone, deep fryer. yes the fryer lol nothing fried was available. They always are super nice in this instance though and try to get it fixed fast which is why I kept it at three stars. ( Corporate or owner if it's franchised, get it together!) Lastly, they do not use gloves! I've went inside twice to get food and they don't use gloves to handle the food. May not bother some but for me it does so that's a big con for me so I don't really go anymore solely because of that. Other than that friendly team, nice people, good food.< /text>

Worst Jack in the box ever. wouldn't reccomend it to anyone. went three days in a row for lunch and the first day went well but the second day I order a Jr. Bacon cheeseburger without mayonnaise and it still had it. The third day I ordered the same and they gave it to me without mayonnaise this time but didn't put bacon. Such a waste of money. I suggest the McDonald's or Carls Jr. Nearby for anyone in the area looking for cheap eats.< /review>

< Review>
No lids for small cups. Soda machine was filthy. All the tables were dirty yes all of them. not only were my fries cold and tasted old I ordered curly fries and got regular ones because the guy wasn't paying Attention when I ordered. The ATM is broken without a sign on it and is stealing people's money then when asked they inform the people it's broken.  The bathroom is nasty the sing super dirty and the trash is over flowing and the toilet is also nasty.</Review>

<text>Went through drive thru at 10 pm on 10/13/2017. The total was $8 and some change, paid with a hundred dollar bill. The girl gives me my money in a hurry and tries to give me my food asap. I count the money and see that instead of $91 cash back, she gives me $71. So I tell her and she says "ok", pulls the other $20 out of her drawer and gives it to me. Seemed a little snakey, because she didn't even hesitate to give it to me. If it were me, I'd be w about my drawer being short. She probably does this to unassuming people, without them realizing it.</text><rating>1</rating><pics>None</pics>< name>
