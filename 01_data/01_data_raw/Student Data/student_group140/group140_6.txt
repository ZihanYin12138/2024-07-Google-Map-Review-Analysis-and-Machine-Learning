I’ve never had an issue with these wonderful people at all. I’ve had several rainy days and they’ve been nothing but an absolute blessing to me and my family. May God continue to bless you folks at the Helping Hands pantry. You all are appreciated.<//Text>

We appreciate everything and everyone here! Due to illness, we were needing to come here to survive. Trader Joes donates all their food items that haven't been sold by a certain date, that doesn't mean its bad!
Use by date=eat at your own risk
Sell by= by law if not sold by a certain date, must be removed or donated
Expired date= means the flavor might not be up to selling standards, not that its not edible.
They offer a shopping cart full of various foods for 5 dollars
You can buy other items super cheap at table.
You receive two boxes of various items, free per signed in at door, per person
Breads are available
They take donations of clothes, shoes, pet food etc...
Everyone is a volunteer and work hard. So be polite to them please.
Parking is great with disabled available.

Thank you to Joyce and volunteers, at our hardest time, you offered a smile, a hug ( pre Covid) and encouraging words.
Please wear masks to enter.<//Review>

All is expired Trader Joes food. Taste bad, spoiled. There needs to be another way to donate food instead of bringing things Trader Joes wont sell. Why would we want that? Its been like that. They are right behind a Stater Brothers warehouse, thats where they need donations from. Just because its being thrown out why would I want 10 of the same item? Place is shady, not good management.</review>

<Review>I think this food pantry is great!. They need more volunteers. I go twice a week and our family is very satisfied. For free we get vegetables, breads, pastas, salads, chips, cookies etc a variety of foods. Not the same thing everyday of course it. We have a family of 7 & we are able to keep our tummys full.</Review>< rating>

<Text>I am shocked by the change of non-profit organization that used to help me and many other people now has a new person running it for profit charging for bags to put food in and even for the monthly commodities?

Really wanted to give this place a try, even after reading the terrible reviews because I was in a bind. Worst idea ever. They keep the donations and all the name brand items they keep or put a price on them. Workers are rude and don’t explain anything to you. They direct you to a bin that they want you to take items from. There were rotten tomatoes and lemons. It was disgusting. The bins the food were put in were dirty. I immediately sanitized my hands when I left from inside.</review>

<review>Donated here once and never went back. The large amount of food items I was donating were all higher end health food brands. Although there was a line of people out front in actual need, the workers jumped on the stuff I brought in and helped themselves to what they wanted to keep. Step two was to see if I wanted anything from the stuff that was suppose to go out to the front that others had donated, I did not. Step three was finally to take what was left of what I brought in to the people it was meant for.</review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<Text>Charity meant to be sure deprived persons(sometimes via crime...other times 37 year immigration problems) in surrounding area do not starve or die on their land.  The regulation could use a review and the building a bit of work, but they've always been courteous and welcoming if you're aware of them...encouraged 📚 reading.  Took 'em ☝ on that offer...but they're a bit behind.</Text>< Time>

<Review>This business is open at least 5 days a week. If you're desperate for food you may find something here. Just be advised it's salvage food. there's not variety in the amount of food that they can give you on a weekly basis. But they will show you food in the shopping cart for an extra $5. the amounts and types of food Berry and the quality is not often very good.</Review>< Pictures>

I think whoever has been running this place recently is a giant scam artist they constantly close before they are suppose to all the workers that drive nice cars are keeping the food I've been recording everything that goes on with a camera they are rude and mean to the homeless 😡 and I'm trying to figure out why this place is even open and which companies donate to them so we can show evidence to them and have them donate to other true helping food banks</Text>

A truly wonderful place run by wonderful people.  You can get a bag of items for free or for a $5 donation you can get a shopping basket full of meat, cheese, milk...whatever was donated.  It helped feed my family several times when we were struggling to survive and allowed us to spend our limited funds on gas to get to work rather than food.< /text>

<text>Here are the correct Hrs open but most are about 1 hr late if coming to get food
Monday - Friday 8:30am - 11:30am
Saturday 8am - 10am
Sunday 8am - 11am
I keep putting a picture of time but it won’t show so here is the time  also
Volunteer standpoint they are unorganized un-less you’re a regular volunteer and for people who are coming to get food make sure you have your ID you can get a shopping cart worth of food for 5$ ( better/ good food)
( warning )  regular food mostly near or  past expiration< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

This place is a for profit organization. Rude staff and they make you pay for food they get for free, and pocket the money. We walked 10 miles to get here and they laughed at us. We got moldy bread, and what was edible they wanted a top dollar for. Somebody please report this place. They are scamming people for money and keeping all the good food for themselves.</Review>

They gave people food who had tickets before they opened  the doors for us. Lots of food left before they opened the doors and we did not get meat...that went before they opened. They are not organized not informative to help you through the process. I am embarrassed to recommend  this place to anyone.<//Text>

I go here when need food! I am disabled and a veteran of the US Army! If it wasn't for them I would be starting at times with being on SSDI it doesn't give you enough money to pay your bills as it is plus rent and other things! I budget and without them I would not make it! I am also a retired surgical tech/ VN if I thought they had an attitude it wouldn't bother me! Your not getting them to come home with you! But Everytime I go to Helping Hands Olga and the volunteers treat me well!<//Text>

This place is filthy. I don't know how the health department hasn't close it down. Only if you are in absolute despair and nowhere else to go, and your only choic I attended about 9-7 months ago because a friend recommended that I save money buying a shopping cart of food for $5.00. The first time it was worth the gas but the second time the shopping cart was half full, sloppy and their system seemed to be extremely unorganized. Most of the food was spoil, expired and a lot of the boxes and bags were opened. They were also selling chicken at the same price markets sell them. I thought the chicken was supposed to be given or included in the cart but instead the chicken was being sold.<//Review>

They're selling the USDA food, and told me not to come back when I started asking questions. Absolutely the worst place to get help, unless you have money. Its supposed to be non profit. These people are making a living off the needy and homeless.</Text>

Fraud alert! They are not assisting the community. They sell the food that is to be donated to needy familys. The food is posted as free but they charge you $5-10 a basket. (discriminating) Extra for items that should be free. $$$ and the women volunteering pocket the money right in front of you. Disgraceful.

☆☆This is NOT charitable service for non profit as discribed.</Review>

I have been in this place for Community service, and I was very disappointed because they are so rude, they didn't explain well what to do, in my second day there,  the manager of this place was so rude with me talked to me like if I had to much time there and, supposed I was doing nothing according to her,  I was asking and asking what to do, I saw everybody just stand up doing nothing, and she was talking loud only to me, do something, I said to her, well I have been asking what to do and nobody answer and when I trying to do something the people working here said to me no,  here not,  over there, and then all that people was getting things for them,  and when I try to get something, they tell me you have to wait until you go.  They are very disorganized, and rude. Very unprofessional. Very dissapointed with this place.</Text>

< review>
If I could give -5 stars I would. DON’T WASTE your time here. I made a reservation for a trailer with a confirmation number and everything, drove 35 mins to get it and when I got there they had NO IDEA what I was talking about and then said that the only trailer they had was being requested by the previous renters for another day so I was out of luck. They took my card information and everything. & EVERY SINGLE REPRESENTATIVE was completely rude and hesitant to help me in any way.< /review>

Good service. Kept  a hold on my deposit forever and had no problem taking the total mount after I turned in the truck. Their call center service sucks, but local shop was really good.<//Text>

<text>Be careful with these guys. I have rented equipment from uhaul many times with no problem. The last time I had to keep the truck a few extra days and upon return my bill was astronomical. I disputed the bill and now it is even higher! They advertise less than 20 bucks a day but for 8 days I am supposed to pay 475 dollars? ....oh yeah, a list of ridiculous fees.

<Text>We have been working with Alex Rodriquez for the last month trying to organize packing and shipping for my sister to downsize and move to Illinois.   Because of Dr's appointments, our schedule has been chaotic to say the very least.   Alex has been understanding,  supportive and more helpful than I could have ever anticipated. He and the other staff members are always respectful, helpful and courteous.  Thank you!   Charlie and Jill Brewton< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<Review>This place is a joke I got a 1979 Jeep Renegade 350v8 with the original stock Jeep hitch on the back and they say I can't rent a tow dolly from them to tow a Meyers manx VW fiberglass dune buggy 30 miles., I've rented from other U-Hauls many times with my Jeep and never had a problem they won't even work with you these guys are idiots! I would have gave him a zero rating but I can't so I gave him one star< /Review>< Rating>

They want to raise the rent, Security is very poor next to none, Employees don't seem to know anything about the fees and bait and switch between them and their corporate office about the fees. This place really needs an overhaul for knowledgeable and helpful employees  and their security needs it as well.< /Text>

<Review>Really bad service from a lady and a guy working there, I need it a trailer and they said they didn't have any when they had 2 outside, so I told them they had 2 outside and they had an attitude and said they don't know anything that they couldn't help me with that. It should really be less than a star.</Review>< pictures>

True to their name, they really do have 'tasty' food. I ordered their Mongolian chicken, and boy was it good. The chicken was extremely tender, flavored amazingly well, all balanced by heat due to jalapeños and waxy red peppers. Both soups I ordered, hot and sour, as well as wonton were very delicious. Highly recommend.<//Text>

Very good food and service. Tends toward the spicy side with jalapenos in a few dishes. My favorite is the string bean pork, very flavorful. The portions are generous and depending on how much you order, they have free add-on items. Great for take out. Small tables for eat in.<//Review>

General Tso chicken is a favorite in the house.  20 minutes from phone call to pickup and it is a family run business.   If you like thick fried noodles (Shanghainese), this is the place.  Average dish runs $12-$15.<//review>< Pics>

During lunch time Tues-Sat has a very good price it is the lunch special. It comes with a drink, soup, and half rice or egg fried rice and the other half has the item you want. I would come here next time. Some people get lost and thinks it is in the mall. In maps just type in Lifestyle Furniture & Mattress. It will get you here.<//Review>< pictures>

Looks are deceiving. This place is very popular.  They use a lot of jalapeno pepper.  Sesame chicken was a little dry  but I will return to sample other items.</Review>

I didn't expect this, nor do I like jalapeños. I've been picking through my food to remove them. They burn the mouth a little differently than chilies. It's too bad. If it wasn't for the peppers, it would be excellent food.

<Review>I was hesitant to try this place, but I did based on recommendations from other local guides. I was not disappointed. The food was delicious. The service was fast and friendly. The portions were HUGE. I probably have two dinners worth of leftovers and I ate until I was stuffed. If this place wasn't a 12 hour drive from my house, I would consider it my new favorite spot for Chinese.< /Review>< Pictures>

Love this place for the style of Chinese food. The way the chicken is cooked it comes out crispy and tender but evenly coated in sauce; the dishes aren't overly sauced and you'd be hard pressed to find a pool at the bottom of a to-go box here. Everything that I've had here has been great and I order from here every time I'm in town.< /text>

<rating>3< /rating><review>The food is pretty good, but I had to grab a menu off the table to see what they had because the "menu" behind the counter is just pictures of only 9 items. It was very chaotic in there. Also there was a $20 minimum for credit/debit orders. That kinda sticks since I'm by myself. On top of all that,  there were two children working there. A boy about 12 and a girl who couldn't be older than 8.< /review>< Pictures>

Looking for a good place for chinese take away? This could be the place. It's tucked away in a half empty strip mall by the Newark mall. But despite it's need of a remodel and some customer service training, it's pretty good. The spicy items aren't too spicy, but aren't bland either. They offer a good amount of food at a decent price. Some of the chicken items use sliced chicken that is so thin I mistook it for chicken skin the first time. The staff isn't the friendliest, but they get the job done. Give them a try and see what you think. It beats the blandness of Panda Express any day.</review>

We visited other Asian restaurants while visiting California. They all came up short, very disappointing. We did one last search & found this restaurant. Read a few reviews, & decided to give this place a try. It was amazing, the best chinese food we had in a long time. Nothing was made in advance & put in warmer's. EVERYTHING was made fresh. I'm back in my home state now, but my next trip back to CA, I will definitely be stopping by.<//review>

We often dine in and order food here.  I love their beef/shrimp chow main, pot stickers, and egg flower soup.  The place is super clean.  I think their tables and windows are cleaner than mine at home.  :) And the staff are very nice.  They even help carry my orders to my car without me getting off my car!  We always make a stop there when we shop in Newpark mall.  Very convenient.< /Review>

<text>FYI...They have re-opened woohoo!!.
The best little Chinese restaurant I have eaten at or done take out with;In all of the bay area in a long time serious no joke people!!

This place serves gourmet level Chinese food that practically no one has heard of yet!!  The crazy thing is you won't expect it when you see the place!! Trust me when I tell you because beening an ex. NY'er I have eaten Chinese from here to Singapore.  I found the place by accident too!!

Only thing I can't figure out is why they are in such an out of the way location!!??</text>< Gmap_id>

Don't let the location fool you. The service is good, but they charge $1 dollar for credit card purchases under $15, which I find annoying.< /Review>

Ordered from here because they offered delivery and I was in a Hotel Room....of which the Order clearly stated!!! You think someone might have thought to throw some utensils in the bag??? Chicken and Corn soup.....and no spoon.....I have no idea what it tastes like, because I can't friggin eat it!!!  Ordered a Soda.....that too wasn't in the bag. Lastly, there was a printout of my order on a 8 1/2 x 11 piece of paper....On it.... my Credit Card #,  the Exp. Date.... the CVV#...Name, Address and Zip.... Are you Freeking kidding me??? Seriously.....Avoid this place!</Review>

<review>I went in simply for the fixing of my ac unit. I dropped my car off at 9 am and didn’t receive it back until closing. I was notified at 430 pm they broke my compression pin. Then at 5 pm at closing time they told me I wouldn’t be able to take my car. They showed me a huge oil spill and said “ this just happened “. They said they needed another 2 grand to fix what they couldn’t readily  identify. My car was leaking when I took it in and if it was why didn’t they say anything until 5pm. The owner isn’t knowledgeable and it seems the mechanics are running the show. They were passive when telling me about costs and are clearly overcharging me. I took pictures and will be speaking to my lawyer. I went in for one thing and now they are holding my car saying I must pay for multiple damages that didn’t occur until I brought the vehicle into the shop. This is unacceptable and I will not be liable for Midas negligence!< /review><Name>Joshua Riggins< /Name>< pics>

Sent my wife over to have her camaro aligned. No check engine light was on. After they put it up on the rack they take the initiative to start ordering new tires without consulting her. (2,500$) then they tell her that the control arms are unsafe to drive and have alot of play, they are pushy to sell her new control arms and install them at ( 989$) which is laughable because even autozone will sell a pair for under 200. She tells them she just wants to fix it herself so they pull it off the rack. Now the check engine light and monitor system is on and they refuse to fix it. Be wary of these people. My wife is very knowledgeable with the actual price of replacing car parts and she refused service after they kept pushing her to buy. Don't be swindled by these salesmen, they are looking to make a buck and will not fix your car until you fork out your savings. Terrible service, terrible people to try and assume you can take advantage of a woman just because you think women don't know cars.</Text>

<Review>Originally had steam coming from firewall going onto window it was obviously a coolant leak me being a 18 year old took my car in paid for diagnostic they said they replaced the cooling housing which i believe is the thermostat left the car and got a call manger said brakes and rotors should he done they will come with a LIFETIME WARRANTY here’s the catch yes you have warranty on parts but not service would be another $100 just for labor all in all i spent $950 on a cooling housing replacement with a flush and brakes however 500 miles down car was steaming again all in all i had no problem paying the money but honesty is always a good key to business i know now they got me for my dollars NOT RECOMMENDED!!< /Review>< gmap_id>

I schedule an appointment to receive an estimate on my brakes. The inspection is provided for free. My appointment was set for 11:45am, they didn't look at the vehicle until after 2pm. I wasn't able to afford the $1250 break job and asked to leave.  Instead of lowering my vehicle from the lift they worked on another car first.  It was after 3pm before I was able to leave.< /Text>

Great friendly service. They go over the complimentary inspection with you and provide you with options. I trust the staff. They offer a lot of discounts and rebates when I use my Midas card and even when I don't.< /text>

I have taken my cars to this shop a couple of times to get things fixed. I noticed that every time they fixed something serious on my car sooner or later would have another problem. Well i left it at that and took it in again  i thought it was just me making it a big deal but i still took it in again a couple of weeks ago to get my stering pump fixed for my 2011 GMC Acadia. Mind you they had my truck for 2 days. They charge an arm and leg for everything. My SUV drives fine now, but the air system is messed up now, makes a horrible noice and blows out hot air that didn't do before i took it to them, I'm pretty sure they did something because now i look back and realize that this happens every time they do a service, something else breaks or leaks ... i will never go back to that shop again ... I 1000% don't recommend this place!!! I'm so angry because now i have to put more money into it because of non honest people, crooks like them.< /Review>

Either they dont know what they are doing or scamming people. I had spent too much in service from them for not even fix the initial problem. It's happened with a service engine light, exhaust, radiator  and finally my power steering. All of those areas were serviced by this place and all of them had to be serviced again.<//Text>

< Review>
Overcharged me for parts and labor. I spent $800 for a $300 job. Showed me pictures of a more expensive motor mount to try and extract more money from me. The motor mount they showed me didn't even match what my front mount looked like. Had me replace hoses that were not needed. Had me replace spark plug wires that were only a year old. The gasket they replaced, I'm having to have it replaced 2 months later because they didn't do it right. Having work done elsewhere for obvious reasons. They never offered to give me my old parts back. This place gives honest mechanics a bad name and should be shut down. I've also done a yelp review of this, and filed a complaint with the bureau of automotive repair.</Review>

Came back with a coupon amd remembered why I stopped coming back. No matter what you come for they find something wrong that has to be done to finish your procedure. Other places even other Midas do the work requested and dont have any issues even when i didnt fix the "issue". Not coming back for sure.<//text>

I know when going there I'm getting the best service on my car possible. They explain and show me step by step what's going on, (cause I like to know exactly what's happening with my pride and joy). I get great customer service and excellent service on my car. I have told all my family and friends this is the only place in Fresno to go and get great work done at a good price. Most of all I love driving away and feeling so much safer in my car.</text>

With them all they do is overcharge you, and if they don't know what the issue is, they'll put in new parts and say it's fixed, if not you'll bring it back in and they'll do the exact same thing and want more money to put in part's to what it could be, instead of figuring out what it was. They're more into getting as much money out of you then fixing the issue. More of a finesse business like most mechanic shops these days.< /Review>

<Review>I had a scheduled appointment for an oil change. Your customer service advisor Ray did an outstanding job in helping me. My car was in and out within 1 hour of my scheduled appointment. Ray was very professional, courteous and knowledgeable. I will be a repeat customer, not just for the good service but because of the outstanding employee named Ray working the front desk.<//Review>< user_name>

< Review>
This is the worst place done. We have been loyal customers for two years with 3 household cars. The first thing they did wrong was not turn off our air bags in our Navigator and ruined them. We had to pay $500 to replace them. We have a credit card from Midas with nothing due on it and the last time was declined, we ended up paying for it with cash. This time I had my nephew go and take care of my oil change and REGGIE was very rude, arrogant and a JERK! He did not even attempt to call the credit card company or deal with them, while I was at work with no card in front of me to even call. I was at fault to continue to go back for a louse $24.99 deal? It is not worth it, Shields and Chestnut has a good shop and worth the money now. I guess you can't skimp on autocare, because you will get your money's worth in service as well. Midas Corporate will be called and I suggest no one going there. Even one of the workers at one oil change told me, they do people wrong. Now I know!< /Review>

Also warned me of a belt that needed immediate attention unlike my dealer's mechanic who didn't warn me about it. Wait time is a little lengthy but maybe it's due to the service of the car.< /Review>< Pictures>

I had the feeling that they were not listening to me and they just went by what the scanner said. After almost $900 in work, I picked the truck just to find out that it is in the same exact condition I brought it in. Of course I was asked to pick it up on a Saturday right before the closed. I went home hooked up a cheap $20 scanner made some research and found it had a short. Total cost of parts $3 for a fuse and a zip tie. This guys do not know how to diagnose a problem all they want to do is charge you money to change parts left and right that you might not need. I won't ever go back to this place.< /Text>< username>

It was a horrible experience, I’ll never recommend this place. We waited over 6 hours to change the alternator of my car, they said it will take only hour and half. They took the tire off and many other parts of the car to change the alternator, when it was time to put everything together there’s was parts missing, there’s loose parts. It was so terrifying to drive off the parking lot, when we got to the first stop light the car started smoking, we had to stop and check it by then it was 11:00 pm and we had two kids in the car. And we ended paying $560. Now I have to take my car to the dealer service, so they can check what they did, I don’t feel safe driving the car, and forgot to mention we live in the mountains. I’ll not stop until I get my money back and all the money that I have to pay to take it to the dealer. This doesn’t stop here.<//Text>

<review>Make sure they have your oil in stock before you proceed.  I came in with my vehicle and requested for 10W-40 oil for my vehicle.  The employee dealing with me informed me that they did not have the oil I requested and they could get it for me for an extra price.  I thought little of it since I felt the price would just be around $40.00 since the coupon I presented to him was for an oil change and tire rotation for $24.99.

Everything went wrong from there, they didn't do my tire rotation because they felt the tires were not adequate to do it.  Than they charged me $29.99 for the 5 quart 10W-40 oil that only costs $19.99 at O'reilly.  You would think that for $29.99 that they would be using something like Quaker State, Mobil 1, or even Castrol GTX.  Nope they just used O'reilly 10W-40 oil.

I ended up paying $69 total for an oil change that I could of paid red carpet car wash (which is right down the street) $40.00 to do the same service.  The people are nice, but I didn't expect to be blindsided by the price.  I paid for it since Midas did do the service.

Will I ever go back?  Nope< /review>< Pictures>

<review>Dryest chicken I've ever had. Ordered mild sauce. Where is the sauce? Why in the world is it so damn dry? No taste! Almost inedible.< /review>< pics>

<Review>We moved nearby last summer and have gotten food from this wingstop at least 10 times and only once has my order been correct. That being said, the chicken is really good so they get 3/5 because it's hard to beat the all in bundle with the amount of food you get for the price and we always have left overs and sometimes the surprise sauce is still pretty good< /Review><rate>3<//rate>< time>

Today was the first I tried wing stop and I gotta say it wasn't great. The garlic parmesan wings and fry's were tasteless. The rest of the wings tasted a bit old. I'd say the biggest gripe I had today is with all the wings I got and the mess they cause, not a single napkin. The 2 stars is for the corn they had. So from experience it's was definitely not worth $54. I'm hoping buffalo wild wings will be a better experience</Text>

<review>BEWARE!!! Don't order from the store! We ordered directly from the store because it says they deliver... they use doordash and don't stand behind there delivery! An hour after it was picked up we still had no food, we are 6 min away! We called the store and was told not our problem! Manager screaming inbthe background "not anything I can do from here!" Wont be ordering from them again, delivery, pick up or dine in! 15 min after calling the store food was tossed on our porch, completely cold!< /review>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Love this establishment! I definitely recommend you come treat yourself to some quality chicken!

Pros:
-Fast & Friendly Service
-Menu is Easy to Navigate
-Affordable!
-Delicious Food: We love the Garlic Parmesan Boneless Wings!
-Always Clean
-Tons of Soda Options to Choose From

Cons:
-Be Sure to Ask When The Rolls Were Last Made. If they are fresh the are divine! But sometimes they are a bit stale.

Overall, I think this restaurant is top-notch!< /Review>< Pics>

I ordered garlic parm and BBQ.  The garlic parmesan was flavorless and the BBQ sauce was only drizzled on the wings. What's going on with quality? Raise the prices, cut the quantity. Lost my business forever.< /Text>

Decided to go to wingstop last night for some dinner for my family ordered 20pc tender combo (10 bbq + 10 garlic parmesan)  to look in my bag as soon as I return home to see the whole entire order was COMPLETLY INCCORECT. What I received was 20 very over done burnt very greasy chicken wings (with bone) . Do no recommendations this place after being told to come back they would replace my order was treated extremely good and disrespectful total lack of customer service and this all came from the manager!
I WILL NEVER COME AGAIN!!!<//Review>

<text>Just paid $41. For 3 10 piece combos and my fries look very old and redipped in oil rather than fresh. My boneless wings taste old too. It’s like they just took old wings that were already done and added seasoning to them. They were like gummy but not undercooked gummy more like recooked gummy and dry. Everything was cold. I’m very disappointed. My husband called to speak to a manager and we still haven’t heard back. I really loved wing stop until today. I’m really sad I lost my appetite after just taking 1 bite. This is awful. I can’t believe I wasted my money on this. Never again.</text></record></dataset><record>

Thos was my first time at a Wingstop. I gave it a 4 star because it takes 10-15 mins just to get your order. I also didn't like is everytime I turned around an employee was on their cell phone. I really think it is rude and at least go to the back of the kitchen or take a break.
I ordered the 8 piece hickory bbq  flavor and also the Hawaiian flavor. This was more than what I thought I could eat. The hickory had a good flavor but the Hawaiian was way too sweet. However, the boneless chicken was so tender. The combo came with a drink and a basket of fries. Overall experience it was just good.</review>

I could barely understand the person who had an accent not his fault and Safeway across the street chicken wings at the deli taste better than these at wing stop and no mirror in the bathroom to check if you have any sauce on your face. No garbage containers to throw away dirty paper towels. Not being mean just honest.< /Review>

<text>Okay people: The food, great!! The place, it's ok. The service was amazing! There is no napkins at all! You are stuck with using a in-sanitary roll of paper towels or toilet paper. BRING YOUR OWN NAPKINS OR WET WIPES!!! The prices are a bit too high to my liking. Thank GOD the food and service was good. I'd suggest waiting till it's been open for a while to eat there!<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< user_id>

Occasionally the winds are a little dry, but usually very well seasoned and flavorful.  The rolls are the bomb.  Fries are OK.  Service is fast and friendly, but because of the freshness, it can take a little bit to get your food.<//text>

<review>Very good wings.   I would suggest always calling in for take out.  They do take about 20 minutes on average to make your wings</review>< Pics>

There's a Hispanic woman who works here who is a sweetheart. Super friendly! The food is good but takes a while it seems.</Review>

<review>This wingstop may be the best one ever. The staff was a bit hurried but the manager at the time pulled me aside to apologize for the untimelyness of my order. She assured me I was next up and my would be fresh and hot. True to her word my order was next and it was delicious when I got it home. The kids, the wife and I were all very pleased with the meal.<//review><pics>None<//pics><UserId.>103361123923763324852<//UserId.><Name>eric poole< /Name>< Date>

It was ok two girls stare down at people in a rude way like if they have a grudge with people. My girlfriend ask for light seasoning becuase of her allergic reaction if there is too much we had to take her to the E.R. immediately after her neck got swollen not mad just please pay attention to the order you might just kill someone one day< /Text>

<Rate>2<//Rate><text>Ok 1st visit to this location went as follows...ordered online. Went to pick it up..was not ready. Ordered everything extra crispy...we had 4 different combo meals. Got home NOTHING was extra crispy, it was extra soggy and rubbery! They forgot 1 order of fries...it was on the receipt but not in the bag! Called spoke to a manager named Jimmy who said he was sorry and our entire family order would be free next time for the inconvenience. Which brings me to visit #2...spoke to Jimmy to remind him of our free deal...he then conveniently forgot he told us the whole order would be free...he charged us for half of it! Why the entire order was gross and messed up last time not just half. We make the order not very happy once again...we have to repeat the order SEVERAL times before the MANAGER got it right...THEN we go to pick it up ...it wasn't even started until we got there sooo the purpose of calling it in was what then? Again we got home EVERYTHING WAS SOGGY AGAIN...RUBBERY WINGS AND SOGGY FRIES!! Unreal! They gave us 6 extra wings for the wait this time BUT it does not help if it's all gross AGAIN!! No thanks we will go to the greenback location from now on!!<//text>< pictures>

Fastest experience ever. I placed an order for biscuits and gravy on the phone and they had it ready in 10 minutes. Their customer service is great too! I had a pleasant experience. And everyone enjoyed their biscuit and gravy!! Definitely will be returning soon (:< /Review>

Our selections of meat include Bacon, Sausage, Ham, or Tri-Tip. We offer Chorizo now too, and customers are really loving it. You can also get it as a Breakfast Bowl. Plus we have Breakfast Sandwiches or our most popular item the Biscuits and Gravy. Please contact us so we can make the trip worth your time.

3 items only for Breakfast. Breakfast burrito is a little bland.<//review>

This place is awsome. I never thought I would go to a gas station just to order food. It's all made to order, fresh and hot. It's a great value light lunch; most sandwiches also come with a side. There breakfast sandwiches are good too. They got a great ham and cheese you just have to know to order it.< /text>

Tried their hamburgers for the first time today.If you like old fashion burgers made the way you want them, then  your going to love it. red onions, fresh tomatoes, just the right amount of lettuce, the best part was the ton of melted cheese perfectly throughout the burger! took me back in time to the old fashion hamburger places where the cheese runs over the side of the burger and stick to the wax paper, yes I was a kid again and picked off the cheese.  GOOD JOB GUYS</Text>

< Review>
These donuts taste really good. Lots of sweet flavor with a variety of different types. One of my favorite donuts here are the mini donut balls. So yummy.  This is honestly better than dunkin donuts or crispy kreams. I love going here especially since it's close to my school. Delicious!< /Review>

Their donuts are the Best Donuts in Long Beach and any surrounding citys!! We've lived in the neighborhood for 12 years. When we get donuts we Don't go Anywhere Else! The workers are so friendly!! They watched my son grow up from a little guy to an adult now.< /review>

<Review>Circle Donuts - my top pick for South Bay/Long Beach doughnuts. I’ve tried about 15 shops in the area. Nothing necessarily flashy or fancy here, just GOOD classic doughnuts. Quality flavors, and genuine care for their product. Please keep it up! Akun!</Review>< date>

<review>Their donuts taste fresh, but are basically just donuts. Hard to go terribly wrong with donuts, long as they're fresh, but hard to be significantly better than average, either. But their breakfast sandwiches are also super-tasty, and cheap; that's way more of a draw (their lunch sandwiches are presumably also good, but not nearly so cheap, so I don't get them ever). They also have a wide variety of excellent smoothies. (I'm a particular fan of the honeydew, personally. The taro is great, too.)</review>< Pics>

I get the coffee, donuts and a breakfast sandwich from this place every time I'm up here. They're all amazing. Granted I get a basic black coffee and simple glazed donuts but IMHO that's the true test of goodness. Last weekend I got an avacado boba shake...she put real avacado in it...amazing! The only bad thing I can say about it is you need to watch how often you eat here...your waistline will suffer :-)<//Text>

<Review>The Orange County Orthopedic Group only wants your INSURANCE $.  They misdiagnosed my wife who was experiencing lower back pain and stated, "we will do everything to avoid surgery."  This created insurance billing for over 2 month with unhelpful shots (10 in one visit) which resulted in to paralysis in her leg.  The chiropractic procedures DO NOTHING and are non responsive.  They herd you into the office(waited 1.5hrs for a scheduled appointment) and push you out with no relief all for insurance billing.  Avoid these doctors at all cost.  They will try to move you through their network of partnering Dr's in order to continue billing your insurance "Oh see a nerve Dr., I have someone I can recommend he's expecting you." Or, "I guess you'll have to see a Spine Surgeon now, oh I have someone I can recommend, he's expecting you."  Really...?  Initially Dr. Vyas you advised that surgery would be the last result.  Oh, I get it.  3 months of insurance billing and paralysis now push you on to the next.....Crooks.....!< /Review>< Rating>

I have been a patient at Dr Vayas office since June 2020 . Very professional office. Dr Vayas and his team are great. The team makes you feel comfortable and are very attentive and helpful. I am so glad I found this office. Dr Vayas has exceeded my expectations. This is truly a great team of medical professionals.< /Text>

I don't know which one was worse,  the misdiagnose or ignorance.
"Dr." Vyas misdiagnosed cancer with muscle spasm and injected cortisol.  Later an intern in UCI diagnosed cancer the second he saw the x ray.  The license of this so called Dr should be revoked for the sake of people.  I called his office several times but he preferred to ignore.  Hopefully,  I'll see him in court.</Text>

<review>Extremely friendly and professional office.
Dr Vyas was thorough, patient and accurate with his dianosis.
Therefore his reccomendation was solid.
This medical experience has been the best that I have had in a number of years.  Get here if you can.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Usually I do not write reviews for the Doctors particularly for the doctors with super specialists unless something terrible or abnormal things happen.
My Mother-in law, who is 85 Years old, lives with us in Corona. She is healthy and fit to her age and does the routine walking workouts as a ritual. On Dec 6 2018, she completed her morning routine walk and after a bath started complaining about pain her ankle.
Such a sudden swelling and complaint for pain would lead you to believe the sprain or muscle twitching. My younger son, who is into his internal medicine residency, started icing and keep foot elevated to alleviate the pain. Her pain and swelling subsided but not to a great extent.
We decided to consult nearby ortho but being last day of the week no appointment was available. I am patient with Dr Shail Vyas and contacted his office to see if he can accommodate in his busy schedule. We were there right at 4.30 PM just before closing hours of his office.
Dr Shail Vyas asked few questions after physical exam like whether she had a Fever or duration of the pain and other complaints and recommended to have x ray to rule out any bone or muscle issues. But even before getting X rays he opined that it seems something abnormal like infection. I was just starring at him wondering how in the world sudden traumatic swelling has to do with infection????
After getting X rays, he started elaborating on his observation and opinion----It is a staph infection slowly spreading to the body, you need to get a tissue culture, blood screening and MRI and your next stop should be in your area community hospital ER.
He gave us a note describing all of these recommendations and advised to show it to the attending doctor at the hospital ER.
Attending doctor at the hospital ER room, just looked at the ankle and glanced at the note. In a very sarcastic and apprehensive tone he opined that it could a gout or minor hair line crack and why these super specialists would get to a conclusion even without a blood test? After a long wait, Blood work, MRI and haggling 8 hours after her admission attending doctor admitted that it is a staph infection and we must follow the procedure prescribed by Dr Vyas!!!
My mother in-law was diagnosed with staph infection and had to undergo surgery on emergency basis as infection was spreading fast due to weak immune system. She is still undergoing wound care treatment at home.
I cannot imagine if Dr vyas would not have advised us to go to ER as our next stop. I wish majority of doctors and specialist doctors would have such acumen and professional integrity.

Here my experience is contrary to my belief and encouraged me to write a honest review.< /text>

Do yourself a favor and check it out.  The cheese boards are beautifully presented with high quality cheese and meats.
My family and I shared a few different sandwiches and I really can't pick a favorite.  The prime rib sandwich dipped in au jus was amazing.  My kids loved the cheese sandwiches with the creamiest tomato soup I've ever tried. But if I had to pick a favorite it would have to be the California Turkey..  All sandwiches come with the best bread...light and perfectly toasted.</review>< user_id>

<Text>Naveed, the owner is awesome. I ordered a 5-Cheese plate with some add-ons. He actually brought it to my seat at the Wine Bar and offered us extra bread and honey sauce. Say hi to him when you visit because he's really friendly and the state has reopened! Its awesome seeing the owner working alongside their employees, and that shows me great leadership.

Ordering from here is pretty simple. If you intend to sit within the building that is visible to them, you can have it as dine-in and you will be given a number, which then they will bring the food to you, however, if there arent any spaces, you can also have it to-go and you can pretty much roam the whole area and sit anywhere you like. The wine bar is also okay as long as you are drinking their wines.</Text>< rate>

Delicious selection of food. Their veggie cheese sandwich is out of this world.  And the one with cheese, honey and macadamia nuts is to die for!</Text>

What a fantastic find! I wasn't planning to make a purchase because I was just looking around but once I started reading the menu I knew I couldn't leave without making a purchase. Good thing too because the food was delightful! I ordered the CA Turkey Love sandwich for myself and the Hot Italian sandwich for my husband. The customer service was great! We ended up eating half for lunch and had the other half for dinner. The sandwiches were nicely toasted open face before the halves were put together. This allowed for the flavors to meld nicely. Every bite of mine made my mouth so happy! If you're in the area I highly recommend stopping by and grabbing a sandwich. I will definitely return for another as well as some of the other delectables they have on their menu.<//review>

<text>Going here was such an amazing experience! I went to try to buy some fancy cheese and Salamis to make a makeshift fancy plate for date night and I was not disappointed. I really wish I knew how to attach pictures lol. The staff there were very patient, kind, and knowledgeable about all the cheeses and meats they had (more than I really expected from what looks like just a sandwich shop) and made delicious recommendations based on my tastes. I told them I liked saltier, butterier semi-soft cheeses and they quickly presented some options based on that vague criteria alone! I'm not well educated on the names and brands of cheese just the consistency that I like and they didn't make me feel bad about it. Fantastic staff, delicious products, and clean facilities make this my new go to place for when I want to feel a little fancy 😉< /text>< username>

The cheeses 🧀 were really tasty. You did not get to choose which cheeses you ate,  just how many and what types. They also serve sandwiches here but I did not get to try one (yet). #LocalGuides</review>

<Review>Elizabeth helped me find 5 amazing cheeses by offering samples and commentary that was really helpful! She didn't seem rushed even as the store was nearing closing (15 minutes). She was also able to expertly manage the other guests while still making everyone feel welcome. Definitely I will be coming back! (also AMAZING prices!)<//Review>< Pictures>

<Text>We stopped by for a snack and ended up ordering 2 sandwiches instead. I had the D'aff - d'affinois cheese with wildflower honey and Marconi almonds. Such a simple sandwich but with the best ingredients because it floored us! We were in heaven! First off, d'affinois is my favorite cheese ever and second, that bread was nicely toasted, crunchy, and light. High quality ingredients is all you really need in creating a solid sandwich.

We also ordered another sandwich with green apple, turkey, cheese, garlic aioli, and arugula. Another simple sandwich but outstanding! Definitely hit the spot! We highly recommend this place for lunch, snack, cheese craving, whatever!<//Text><date>1566226497680< /date>< Gmap_id>

Great (small) place and everyone I’ve dealt with there has been knowledgeable and friendly. It’s a rotating selection so be ready to try something new each time.</Text>

(Translated by Google) A cheese maker or my can find goat cheese, mimolette, idiazabal, and some other cheeses ... They also sell baguettes and some products from France, jam, sauce and pastilles. Attention closes at 6 p.m. I'll just have to teach the saleswoman how to cut the log goat! 😏

(Original)
Un fromager ou mon peut trouver du chèvre bûche, de la mimolette, de l'idiazabal, et quelques autres fromages... On y vend des baguettes également et quelques produits de France, confiture, sauce et pastilles. Attention ferme à 18h. Il faudra juste que j'apprenne à la vendeuse comment on coupe le chèvre bûche !😏< /review>

Y'all! Roller derby is so much fun to watch! It's like asv action movie but right in front if your face for a very small fee! It's less or maybe around the same amount as going to see a movie and your money goes not just to the players but to help them play at the venues they battle at. Also all the teams I know host fundraisers for various causes and donate all the proceeds! They do big things for our communities! If you haven't gone you gotta check it out. It's a PERFECT place to bring a date, you'll have a great time and it's always rad to give  support back to our communities. You give, they give, we all give=thriving community< /review>

<Review>Excellent Roller Derby! Spending your Saturday night here is a great idea. It's family friendly and so much fun to watch! They have different ticket options and the VIP ticket comes with food! The skaters never fail to give you a great game and are super friendly! Most importantly, the team wants you to have as much fun as they are having, so they do their best to make your night exciting, as if the Roller Derby weren't exciting enough!<//Review>< Pictures>

<Text>Rude customer service on March 27, 2021...typical of 2.5 star hotel which should have tipped me off... when you're in the service industry it's paramount that you show and be courteous to your customers/clients... I didn't catch her name but she spoke with a disrespectful tone... upon my check-in I got finessed with a $100 deposit hussle which wasn't mentioned in my booking arrangements...I will not be returning and I definitely will discourage friends/family/strangers from future bookings of this hotel... I will say that you still have comfortable beds in your hotels.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Time>

This room was okay but it could have been way better. This room was not cleaned the way it should have been.  Receptionist was nice at check in. We went to turn the light on and there was spider webs on the lamp. I wiped down the remote things and it was filthy! If you're going to stay here id recommend sanitizing everything when you get there because they sure aren't doing it.< /Review>

<Rate>3</Rate><text>Super friendly staff.

This "extended stay" hotel does technically have a kitchenette, however they forgot a few important things like a coffee pot, dishes, and utensils. I chose to stay at extended stay hotel BECAUSE they have these things so that I don't have to go buy a second coffee pot, since I have one at home, and am not at home/can't travel back across the country to get mine.

Lots of wear and tear, and I'm pretty sure a place can't be clean, let alone sanitary with dust and roaches.</text>< pics>

I don't mean to sound corney, but because of the pandemic, Extended Stay saved our lives. It's surprisingly quiet here, the whole staff is great (a little short handed, but still great).  No infestations!!🤩  Business so busy, they run out of towels before I can dirty up mine.  Go online for best rates; TRUST ME! TELL THEM ?13 SENT-YA.< /Text>

Very disappointed! The hotel is more of low income housing! Kids running all around, doors slamming. Had to get ear plugs to get some sleep. The room itself floor was sticky maybe bad mop job. I could go on worst experience I’ve ever had at Motel. Also they state coffee maker and utensils for room amenities that’s a negative< /Review>

Clean room with the kitchen as an added plus. We stayed during a stormy night and about 2 hours into our stay we lost all tv connection. We weren't able to watch the tv until the next morning when we were checking out. Other than that the room was decent and great for a last minute reservation.< /Text>

<Text>This is an awful and disgusting place to stay. The room was dirty, the sheets look like they haven’t been changed. The room smelled like someone had been smoking weed in it for years. Also, it’s is an unsafe place. Our car was broken into minutes after arriving and we had even gotten all our things out of it before it was broken into. Definitely not a good place to stay especially if you have kids.< /Text><user_id>111494970907413469095< /user_id><Gmap_id>0x809ad7a4de460a71:0xfbbb65a762bfee56<//Gmap_id>< Name>

Property was dirty and I felt unsafe for covid compliance as well as general safety. I am 64 yrs old and very concerned about covid. A cleaning staff person was getting on to the elevator with me and was not wearing a mask, so I got off. A couple exited the elevator, not wearing or carrying masks. Other people were hanging around outside my room, again not wearing or carrying masks. I never even entered my room. I turned around, went to front desk and checked out as soon as possible. I reentered my credit card in order to get the $100 mandatory deposit I was charged when I checked in. It was such a relief to leave. I stayed at very clean and safe Sheraton 4 Points, which was also closer to the Sacramento Airport. I had a very early flight and that was crucial, as I had to return my rental car.< /Text>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Review>First let me say, the front desk staff was very kind and friendly. I chose this place for the kitchen, and thought I was getting a real deal. Very disappointed. The place is showing serious wear and lack of long term maintenance. Hard water deposits on the sink fixture and mold stains in the bathroom indicate someone occupied this room for a long time without any basic cleaning. Frame on the bathroom mirror was worn away to bare wood. Floor was brand new laminate, I've got a good guess as to why. Only a small bit of toilet paper left on the roll and no spare, hair in the shower drain. No door sweep let in cold air all night with only one thin blanket and no spare. Door frame seemed a little out of place, and deadbolt seemed offset, as if the door was busted open at some point? Fire alarm went off at 2 am for about 30 seconds and I worried about my safety the rest of the night. I know this is supposed to be a long term option, but wouldn't expect this lack of care and maintenance in a Motel 6. Perhaps they cater to transitional housing for the homeless? Won't stay here again.<//Review>< Pictures>

<rating>1<//rating><Review>If possible, negative 5 stars. Reception lady Angela (white lady with too much lipstick) decided to kick me out of the room because I called in and said there were cigarette burns marks in my sheets. 30 min after calling in she also sent security to check occupancy level in my room. I was alone in my room and communicated with  security. They told me that they would most likely need to kick me out since the receptionist front desk lady Angela was irritated. They said if I have friends coming to have them register with front desk. My guests did not arrive for another  hour. But in the meantime Angela called and accused me of lying to her about occupancy even though I paid for up to 4 people and that I would have others register when they arrived.  She yelled obscenities/cussed at me and hung up before I could let her know that my other occupants would come register when they arrived. When they did arrive and went to register she ignored them and refused to even acknowledge them at the front desk like a petulant child.

Don't walk but RUNAWAY from this place. If they allow a crazy child like Angela to run this place on the weekends I can only imagine HOW THEY RUN this place regularly.< /Review>< pics>

Place looks like a drug paradise!
And lady from the front desk was extremely unprofessional and rude!!!
Refuse to give me any other room because I was making them dirty.
When I sad that I can't make them dirty when they are already dirty she got really angry at me.
Guess truth hurts.
And she asked me to live and never come back.
Never made me happier when she returned my money and I went off of property.< /text>< pics>

<review>Very unkept hotel. Lot of homeless and no security to keep them out or at least from sleeping on the property went to bead early because I had to get up at 230 am to catch a flight. Around 10 pm someone was banging on my door yelling and I yelled back. They banged again and I yelled even louder. Their response was “ I didn’t think anyone was in this room”. Not much sleep after that. It’s a horrible place.< /review>< response>

Not only was the room absolutely filthy, stains on everything from the bedding to the carpets and counter tops, there wasn't even a fitted sheet on the bed. To make matters worse whomever was staying above us was literally stomping and making sound loud noises it sounded like there was a construction site above us. I after next to no sleep I call the next morning to express my frustrations, was told to call back in the morning to speak to a manager about getting a comp the next day. I have been calling for WEEKS now and management STILL has no returned any of my messages. Trash hole of a place, naked tweaker loitering out front and beyond disgusting insides, that was reason enough not to come back but the service is atrocious.<//Review>

<text>Positive: Location is great-close to many shops & restaurants. Fridge, microwave, stove for cooking is a plus. Internet is available, but slow. Negative: Room was old and smelled a bit. Loud music and people hanging outside the parking lot day and night. No housekeeping. Pricy for 2 stars. Bed was small and only two pillows. Could hear my neighbors.<//text><username>Verified Hotel Guest<//username>< GmapID>

Room was as advertised, but it did smell a bit like cigarettes even though it was supposed to be a non-smoking room. I called the front desk to ask for an extra blanket. The person who answered said they had none. I asked for a few extra sheets instead and she rudely relief that they had none of those either. Really?! It was quite disappointing for such a simple request to be handled in this way.<//Text>

<review>Room had someone in it when we arrived and was disgusting. We booked through Priceline last minute and I’ve never regretted something more. We arrived at midnight, exhausted from a long drive. We were told there were no rooms available however upon further review they found our reservation and gave us our key card. As we carried our sleeping toddler to the room a man was running into our assigned room, grabbed a fanny pack an then ran out. We hesitantly entered the room since we were carrying a sleeping toddler and called the front desk to ask why the heck there was a man in there. They had no answers and said they’d bring it up with the general manager in the AM. Their answer to my concern about another person having a key to our room was that we should use the bolt. Unfortunately we have nowhere else to stay tonight so we are stuck here. We bolted the door and barricaded it with the arm chair. Based on the no rooms comment we received when we got here, I suspect they were letting someone squat in this room thinking that no one was coming since we didn’t check in until late. To add to this horrible experience, the room smells like cigarette smoke despite the fact that we specifically booked non smoking. Burn marks on the sink back up my suspicions that this is indeed a smoking room. It also appeared that someone had peed on the bathroom floor - see photos. This place is so disgusting it makes me want to swear.</review>< Pictures>

I found a syringe cap inside the nightstand and a box of unused syringes under the bed.  Poor housekeeping.  The front desk people were very friendly. I did ask for a coffeemaker and didn't receive it.  This room  was for my dad who was visiting from Kentucky because my husband got killed.  He paid a lot of money and this is what be gets.!

We ended up having to go to the store to buy bedsheets because their sheets was visibly dirty and had pet hair! The only 1 chair they had in the room had all kinds of stains. The carpet was visibly filthy and the cabinetry were beat up! The water pressure in the shower was sooo low that it practically just dripped! <br/>More importantly, this place isn't located in a good neighborhood. They were many homeless and low-lives hanging around the building. Some of them even hung around in the parking right outside our window which made us very uneasy! The good reviews posted for this location are either from their own staff or from people who doesn't know any better. Definitely not a safe place and would NEVER EVER recommend!!!</Text>< Pics>

We checked in around 8 p.m. and went up to 319 only to find the room hadn't been cleaned. It looked like someone had just gotten outta bed and showered and left just b4 we walked in. The front desk clerk was apologetic and quickly gave us another room, but that was it. I called extended stay america's 1-800 number and reported it and they said they' get back to us in 24 hours. So far I haven't heard anything but will update this when and if I do.</review>

Everyone beware.......Cockroaches in room 213. I was moved to 136 and the sink was .Clogged and full of gross liquid.  There was cockroaches in this room as well. Druggies all over the parking area. Nothing was done to comp me other than my 972.00 dollar refund that takes 5 business days to receive. I booked my 12 day stay elsewhere.<//Review>

The room was dirty, it was obvious they do not clean each room as they should. I had to go buy bleach and clean the tub, there were past guest items still in dresser. On top of that, they were trying to tow my car and did tow orher guests cars in the middle of the night. For 3 days they tried to tow my car for having expired tags  .</text>

< Review>
This place is the most horrible hotel room I ever used. On getting to the room (324), the blanket was dirty and trash was left in the room by previous occupant, and obviously wasn't taken out and was smelling. We went to the front desk to request for the blanket to be changed and we also showed the picture of the trash but nothing was done about the trash.We ended up taking the trash out by the entrance.< /Review>

<review>Oh yeah, and I almost forgot. My bathroom ceiling almost caved in due to their upstairs guest pipes leaking! So I couldnt even shower because the ceiling above it was wet, leaking and swollen about to collapse any minute.

We asked if there were any accommodations that could made for this extreme inconvenience, and the General Manager said no. That we still had to checkout at 1030 even though our stay was riddled with roach infestation and a leaking swollen ceiling. I have pictures and videos of this all and I intent to contact corporate and the BBB and housing authority. Very upset how me and my family were handled after the extreme inconvenience we experienced.<//review>< pics>

Extended Stays are generally nice. They usually have great prices and very decent rooms which means high value. This particular Extended Stay is a little rough. It would be best to avoid this one unless you have time to check it out in person and it passes your test. Great ice trays though.<//Review>

I only slept one night here and my experience was extremely horrific. I was attracted by bed bugs!!! My bites were so bad I am now traumatize... I can’t sleep at an extended stay ever again! After I brought it to their attention they made me wait a whole two hours before they moved me rooms. So I just left.< /Review>

They have a great little bar in the reception area and all the staff are super friendly!! Also, the prices of the rooms are very reasonable compared to the bigger 4/5* in the area!If you are on a budget, want a decent location this is the place to stay!!!!</text><Gmap_id>0x809ad7a4de460a71:0xfbbb65a762bfee56<//Gmap_id>< date>

Worst place ever. I would not give it one star but needed to write this review. First, there is trash very where, not just around the dumpsters, but piled up on the sidewalk. The trash cans in the stairwells on the weekends are always overflowing. The changed the mattresses out and just threw the sheets on the floor were I found them after working all day. When I went to get clean sheets I was give a bed spread with cigarette burns. The carpet needed to be vacuumed but was not and the person at the front desk could care less and made no effort to rectify the situation. Since work is paying the bill, I am calling my manager today and have them move me to a different facility. This is the worst extended stay I have been at, don't stay here you will want to leave like me.</Text>

<Rating>2< /Rating><Text>Exciting night tonight- Paid for what I thought would be a "nicer" hotel.  Whelp….
1. Homeless (?) hanging around outside,  smoking, and they all seem to know one another.
2. Desk gives me a key- I open room 214 and there's a guy laying on the bed,  old lady in the bathroom.  Just a bit unsettling.  Oops.
3. We get to an EMPTY room,  smells like marijuana,  but clean.

Beware of the bed bugs or fleas. I found clothes from previous guest and children's toys still in the room. I wouldn't recommend staying here. The staff was friendly that's why I gave 2 stars but this place really needs to be steam clean.< /text>

We made our stay over a week in advance, we had a part to go to at 4:00 pm and were driving in and it would take 3 hours
The day of the stay we called to get an early check on and received a conformation. Cool we thought? But when we arrived after 3 1/2 hours on the road due to traffic my wife needed to you the restroom and was told they had no public bathroom in the lobby, so I showed them our conf.  number and e mail with early check in and was told by the same counter person no early check in and our room would not be ready till 6:00 pm . That wasnt going to work we had enough and call Marriott down the street got right in wint in 5 minutes  and my wife used the lobby bathroom with NO DRAMA. ITS a much cleaner hotel,friendly staff and free breakfast in the morning . Beware of extended stay hotel stay away!!!!!!!!!<//text>

So I had got a room for a week. I was informed by the lady upfront no smoking in the room. Not a problem for me since I have kids. So I step outside my door to smoke. The manager crystal had came by knocked on the door like she was the police an asked if we were smoking in the room, clearly I was eating and had my son on the bed feeding him as well. She stated that it was a no smoking room I told her I know that I step outside the door. So then about 4 hours goes by and here she is again telling my husband he can't smoke outside the door, which is fine so he said you can tell her which is me. She then asked if he asking about my husband if he will be here an how long are we going to be here. I told her till Friday. She then proceeded to tell me that she doesn't do good with attitude all due to him telling her that she can tell me. She felt that it was rude because he could of told me. Anyways she said that we can not smoke in front of the door. I said fine but did you need to come to my door twice when the first time I told you that was where I smoke. Now I feel like she is just being rude because both times she said something to my husband an got mad when he said she could let me know. First off if your going to say something to me when thats what I told you I was doing why didn't you tell me no you need to be in the parking lot the first time instead of being rude to say something again. Her response was she can't be out here 24/7. I'm sorry that's your job you didn't have to come back twice if you would of said that the first time. I want to leave but will have to wait for the check since I paid cash they wont give me my cash back and I have no other money than what I paid for the hotel. Smells weird when I came in like old food. Will never be here again would of rather wen to Roseville location.< /Text>

Giving this place a low rating because of the area it's in. Plenty of suspicious people lurking around the property and was not somewhere I felt comfortable leaving anything valuable in the car. Other guests weren't usually the best of people either. I'd try to avoid this place, but if you can't find anywhere else along your spontaneous trip, then it's manageable. Not worth the price though.< /Text>< GmapID>

<text>YUCK! COCKROACHES!!! And a lot of them. :(

The room was outright foul. :( The stained mattress was the first thing to greet me upon entering the abysmal domicile. Abstract spatters covered the ragged bedsheets and limp pillows. The dresser drawers were janky and crawling with bugs. :(

Just...ew! SO GROSS!

The surrounding area is also crawling with homeless junkies and thieves. It is not a safe area by *any* stretch of the imagination.

Definitely do not stay here!<//text><rating>1</rating><date>1561311169034</date><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Since I booked on Priceline, I'm told no refund. Place is dirty! Pretty bad when you have to bring your own disinfectants and clean before your stay! Some guy at the desk said his room had bed bugs! However I torn our bed apart and didn't find any. There was hieever, a dead cockroach on the floor! Come on people! I'm locked in for 4 nights!</review>

There was candle wax on the floor and chair in one room. Then in another room we stayed in there was a cockroach. Then in another room we stayed in it smelled like bug spray. But.. they do offer coffee with creamer and oatmeal and muffins for breakfast, that was nice.< /review>

Never will stay there again. I rented a room after being there over night the next night I stayed cooking on the store after I had fixed my plate and sat down to start to eat I seen a roach.i killed or with a towel took it downstairs to show them they said they don't know. Then they asked me to change rooms gave me a key to check the other room as I entered the room to check it out and on  the back of sink sure it was a bigger pregnant one. Ugh! Went back down there and they wanted to know what I wanted to do it was late and they gonna give me a voucher for a free night at any extended stay but the manger acted like that was it I had to wait to get the voucher the next day. So I packed up and left never will go to this one ever again!</text>

<Review>Can't even give a star rating. 1st room we checked into the ac unit didn't work. So we changed rooms. 2nd room,  when I opened the door, the bed had not been changed from  the previous guest nor had the room been cleaned. One of the chairs was broken. There was trash under the sink,  used soap in bathroom sink and tub, dirty tub the floor by refrigerator was sticky.  The ac worked in this room but was really loud, by the way both my partner and I are death, so it had to have been extremely loud for us to hear it, and the only way to turn it off was to unplug it from the wall. So we reported to the front desk and was informed that housekeepers were gone for the night and that there were no more rooms available. We went down to the  office to get a refund for the room, the front desk personal said it would be 4 to 7 days before it would be back in the account and then mentioned that he would go up and clean the room himself while we were gone down left for an hour or so came back only to find that the bed had been fixed, but not sure if the bedding was changed or not,  the trash had not been taken out nor the bathroom cleaned and sticky floor not been taken care of and now the latch lock in the door was barely hanging on by one stripped out screw. We could tell that someone had been in the room but couldn't say for sure what had been done.  There was no way in hell I would allow either one of us to stay there.  It was a horrible experience and wouldn't even wish upon my worst enemy.</Review>< name>

My employer needed my assistance and put me up at this motel for 10,weeks.  My room was always cleaned on schedule, and the employees were great.  When i had a bad allergy attack they gave me extra tea bags and honey to help with my cough which I was very grateful and happy to receive.</Text>

<Review>It gets zero stars. They cancelled my reservation without telling me. The two room choices I was offered were horrible. The "better" of the two was less the satisfactory to put it lightly. Not only will I never stay in one again, but their corporate office will be hearing from me< /Review>< Name>

This place was gross. First off I landed at about 745pm and didn't arrive to this hotel until about 8 or 830. They tell me they no longer have any king size beds only queens. I went ahead and took the queen because I was tired. The next morning, I went to the desk and I told them I had a separate reservation for the weekend, if I stayed would I get a king. They went out of their way to get me what I needed. So I moved rooms in the afternoon. It was disgusting. First they need to update their rooms. They had this one chair at the table mesh with cloth, when you turned it around it looked like some tricks were turned on that chair, if you know what I mean without being too graphic. The bedspread was old, it was clean, but it still look like it had dirt. When you pulled the bedspread and sheets off underneath the second sheet was stained with blood.  The neighbors had this cat litter box propping the door open and the elevators were trashed. So the staff was nice, that's why I give it a one star. The hotel needs to have a complete overhaul. There were other things wrong with the rooms but I am actually tired of writing.<//text>

A big Heads up, it looks like this hotel gets used to house displaced people and people of housing assistance, lots of drug dealing and prostitution going on and forget about getting a good nights sleep. Doesn’t look like anyone here works and they stay up all night blasting music and getting into fights.

This probably explains why the staff is quick to move actual clients somewhere else when asked.</review>< userid>

< review>
This hotel violates law after law and policy after policy. I stayed on the second floor and have had numerous issues with trashy people partying all ours of the night with a front office that is too lazy to do anything about it, people smoking near my room causing me and my wife to breathe in second hand smoke all hours of the day and night. People from the third floor have spit on me while I was attempting to lean on the rail while on a business call, there are women and kids outside yelling partying and fighting until 3am on a regular basis and twice during my stay the front desk knocked on my door at 2 and 3 am while i was sleeping to tell me that there were noise complaints about me while there was an obvious party going on next door however when i called about the party the front desk said " they said they weren't making noise..... what is the point of a front desk and security that do nothing about legitimate problems? We have complained to the front office both employee AND management and they assure that the issue has been handled and minutes later the smoking and partying continues. The front desk has one particular person named Johnathan , a kid that has long black hair and looks like he is 15 that not only does nothing but he ignores the state laws as well i have personally caught him on both my floor two rooms down smoking two cigarettes in the walkway and i was forced to inhale the second hand smoke upon walking past which is not only disrespectful it is a blatant disregard of California law while on shift, in my day that is automatic grounds for termination. This Child is the reason my wife and i left and moved to a different extended stay in west Sacramento. I will never stay in the North gate extended stay ever again because of their blatant disregard for their paying customers who might i add are paying the kids wages for him to ignore us ignore the law and blow smoke in my wife's face which took everything i had not to report him, the manager and the hotel itself to the police department, heath department, and the local news for the absolute worst customer service i have ever experienced in my entire life and I'm in my 50s. at the very minimum Johnathan should be fired for violating the law on shift and blowing smoke in my wife's face, but at this point i know the management will do nothing that means they have to lift a finger or do anything out of their comfort zone. At this point i Hold the manager responsible for allowing her employee to break the law, harass me and my wife, blow smoke in our faces and spend the entire night walking around taking smoke breaks all over the building disrespecting everyone that PAID for a non smoking room which at this hotel there is no such thing because the staff AND trashy customers have no respect for the law nor the people that have the right to breathe  clean air in THEIR OWN ROOM!!! DO NOT STAY HERE YOU WILL BE DISRESPECTED IGNORED AND TREATED LIKE THE LOW LEVEL EMPLOYEES ARE TOP PRIORITY OVER THEIR CUSTOMERS WHO PAY THEIR SALARY. I have never had a worse experience and neither will you.</review>

Horrible experience!!! Never will I ever make the mistake of being anywhere near this establishment again. Rented one of their rooms and woke up in the middle of the night to see cockroaches crawling in the kitchen!!! And the manager does not deserve to be in his position. He denied everything while yelling at me and even cursing at me. Hes lucky I had wasn't my usual self that day. Stay away!!!!</Review>

<text>I like the rooms, there is a small kitchen so it's like a studio. And since alot of the people that stay here end up staying for quite some time, they don't offer room service daily. If you want your room cleaned, you have to stay there over a week in order for a maid to come and clean your room, if you are staying less than 7 days, then you don't get anyone to come clean your room you have to do it yourself. You have to bring your old towels and sheets to the front desk and they will give you clean ones and you have to put the sheets on the bed yourself and clean by yourself. That doesn't make any sense because you would think it should be the other way around but whatever.< /text>< Resp>

Filthy,floors un-mopped or even vacuumed/swept, kitchen just as if not worse. Burners didn't work, was charged $50 for my service/companion animals and when I let them know they were service animals, the girl requested my "proof/paperwork" and said thatbuf I didn't have it I was being charged anyway but I know that law states its illegal to ask for paperwork.management had yet to respond to my many complaints! Its been 6 days since my stay. Used to be nice, not anymore.....<//Review>

<Text>This motel is unsatisfactory in pretty much every category. I’ve been to a lot of hotels in many cities and this one has the poorest quality I’ve ever stayed at. When we got here, the lobby was tiny and people were crammed. The staff didn’t seem to have a understanding of how to quickly check guests in or the flow of the check in line, as two people behind us got checked in before us. After thirty five minutes of waiting we finally got checked in. When we got to our room. The bed was not made, their was staining and pieces of trash all over the floor and there was leftover food from the guests before us all around the room. Their was a few spider webs in the bathroom. So the room had obviously not been properly tended to in a long time. This motel obviously has a failed management strategy. When you arrive you’ll just have that sense, it’s not a place people go who have 1 detail in their life figured out. I didn’t list all the disappointing parts because there were simply too many but I would never come back here. If you decide to come expect a very very subpar experience.<//Text>< Date>

When we arrived to check in we where told your reservation was cancelled. So we had to go all the way home after the first day. We live in Red bluff California which is a two hour drive. We assume that they cancelled our reservation so they could jack up the price for someone else to reserve. Who does that to someone? Very disrespectful!!!!

Followed instructions for use of house phone for "immediate" service. Phone rang, with no help to answer. Watched as 4 different other guests came to the lobby and use the service phone to only be let down.

Originally booked a room for 2 for an event. Should have been two queen beds. It was a sing king bed. The room smelt like a cross between a dog kennel and a morgue! Oh, and it was like that for ten rooms that we booked for an event!< /Text>

< Review>
This would of been the forth time staying their. Go to the hotel close 12am after being on the go from 10am in Vancouver BC.
She was not a happy camper, a little rude, did want help the 800 number for some reason this only booked me in for Thursday night when I told a few times until Saturday night check on Sunday at 5am.
The front desk did want Exstended my room either until Saturday. Every I stay there I got extra coffee a pot for cooking a fork knife and a can opener completely with no problems, but this it seems that she was not intended in having me there.
Very unpleasant stay, and the room was not completed at all. No totle tissue, one towel one soup. Nothing to cook with no coffee either. A complete waste of time.
My stay was one night only and the last time I will there, and am in Sacramento once a year for medical and spending money on hotel.
This is a complete waste of money.

Never again I will stay there< /Review>

This was the worst place I have ever stayed. Your commercials clearly do not represent this facility. Not sure how a no smoking room has stained cigarette burns all over the sink. Carpet filthy, smells like animals and all the fire alarms pulls on the floors were pulled off the wall with capped wires. Pretty sure that's against code. My suggestion...do not stop!!!<//review>

A little sloppier than the other extended stays that I have stayed in. This is not to say that the place was not clean enough because it is, it is just not the spotless standard I am used to from this chain. Over all the place is quiet and has easy access to the freeways.<//Review>

I was rather fortunate in that my room was reasonably clean. However during the check-in process two other residents came in to complain that their room was a mess.
Stage for 3 Days the first day the AC worked sporadically the last two days the AC did not work at all. The last day I was in Sacramento the temperature was 94.< /Text>

<Review>Worst hotel I've ever stayed in. Absolutely disgusting! Not clean! Should be shut down. Health department should be called. What looked like feces was on the mattress of the sofa sleeper. Greasy smears all over the microwave. Either chest or pubic hair on the bed spread. He switched us to another room. It was a bit better. Still not great!< /Review>< rate>

Horrible horrible horrible... No pillows in my room when I checked in... Trash piled up every where and the smell was over whelming.  You could see the cockroaches scurry across the stair steps and there were so many hookers and pimps and dealers just  walking around the property looking for customers that I wouldn't go outside without my boyfriend by my side. I would never come back to this good foresaken hotel even if it was the last place left...</text>

This place is nasty and raggedy. First room the toilet didn't work, bedding was dingy. The second room was not the king size bed that I had reserved the fridge was dirty and burnt on the inside curtains had food on them had to turn the TV at an angle just to get it to work. When I complained about my &95.00 room I was told I given a coupon to use at any one of there places as long as they had rooms available. That was a lie. I even sent them pics of the place. I will say the front deck ppl where really nice.<//review>

<review>I don't recommend this place at all. Person at the front desk was very rude, he was on the phone and did not even even say hi or nothing, had me waiting for a lil while until another employee came in and took care of me. Very dirty everywhere, room floor was still wet and very sticky, there was still trash from previous guest, a hole on the wall and the sheets did not look clean at all.< /review>< Response>

My experience there was horrible. 3 weeks of torchure and the staff was not willing to do anything about the bed bugs. We showed them the bites, captured a bug and bagged it for them to see. My daughter was seen at the ER for bite infection, bit on her eye which caused swelling, and Because they personally found none at the foot of the beds during there 1 minute search, they stated that we brought them in. Before arriving there and Since leaving, we have not gotten 1 bite. There was dog urine on the stairs, trash at the bottom of the stairs which brought a lot of flies. I will never stay at this location again.< /review>

Tons of roaches everywhere. Woke up at 4am this morning because I managed to kill two roaches crawling on my body. There were tons of spots on the outer top sheet that had roach guts on them( did not sleep on this blanket). Room was supposed to be non-smoking, but one step in, you could smell the thick, musty smoke smell. Room was not clean. Thick layers of dirt everywhere. Will NEVER stay here again, will NEVER recommend. 0 stars.<//Review>

If there was a zero star I would give it. Everything besides the manager was gross. He was helpful and friendly, found a room when they were ‘sold out’ even tho central reservations let me make a reservation. Trashed rooms, garbage overflowing etc. 1st room smelled of smoke and eggs and didn’t look clean. Second room, manager cleaned personally. Had exposed wiring and holes in the walls. 2nd hand smoke resignated through the walls. Saw ladies of the night, drug dealers and people high. Avoid at all costs. Give night
manager promotion to another hotel. Great guy.</Review>

The room was fairly poor, with sheet rock patches and a good air conditioner (only goes down to 68). Only two pillows on the bed, and they were of poor quality. The comforter felt very plastic and fake. The bed is very worn in and on the lower end of the industry standard. Furniture is rough with a lot scuffs, chips and scratches. Paid $8 to do two loads of laundry, there was a mouse in my room (I am sure one of the 'great' tenants, or possibly the maid staff before me left the door open for too long), and the breakfast was pitiful (incredibly minimal). Wi-fi was good though. This place is a hotbed for cheap rooms, and all the great things that come with it, like homeless wanders partially without clothes and such. I recommend a third-level room to avoid the wanders and rodents. :/ I must say that the staff was quite friendly though, best part about the stay by far. I would not stay here again unless the price was dropped to nearly free.< /Review>

<Review>I booked a room around midnight online. I call to confirm my reservation and arrival time and when I show up to check in about an hours drive later I was greeted with a locked office a note on the door giving the most vague information and sent on a scavenger hunt to find a phone in the opposite direction of an arrow along with a disconnected number to reach them on finally I was able to get ahold of some lady after 30 mins of standing In The cold using there phone the lady was rude short disrespectful and told me I was not going t ok get a room until later that afternoon mind u its 2am miles from home after they already charged my damn debit card. Completely ridiculous I will never use them again especially after seeing cockroaches scurrying along there side walks<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Worst experience ever & a total waste of money.. This is a smoking room & there are no ashtrays.. There is only one tiny waste basket in the entire room.. If you are planning on cooking, I suggest you bring your own trash bags.. The room smells like urine.. I don't think the bed sheets are very clean either, it made my skin itch.. There are cigarette burn marks all over the restroom.. There is also a hole in the door that looks to be a gunshot.. The sink next to the electric burners is clogged & the toilet seat is very loose..

To make everything worst, the couple next door is either high on drugs or drunk.. They have been fighting & yelling for the last 2 hours & is still fighting right now as I speak..

As a traveling business man, I sleep at hotels all the time.. This is the worst place to stay.. I am never coming back to this hotel.. If it were possible, I would give this place No Stars..<//Text>

I'd give this place a 0 if I could.  They kicked a black family out for complaining (appropriately) about roaches and rodents.  There were 2 other black ladies standing in the lobby and the reception clerk kicked them out...for just standing there.  I think she assumed they were all together because of their skin color.  Total water bottle betty situation.   I  left immediately...will not stay at placethat treats people like this.  The roaches weren't great either...</Review>

Im only giving them 2 stars because all the office staff were nice and professional. Regarding the room and cleanliness, I wouldn't give this location any stars. The room was dirty. Fan in the bathroom did not work. I had a mouse in my room. Thank God no cockroaches. Room is extremely small! Exterior of the property needs to be cleaned up. More then with just a leafblower.< /Review>

I was staying at Northgate extened stay  america. I wasn't too happy with place but we had gotten a good deal for how long we had planned on being there but the new manager is very rude and can be very hostile. We had told the front desk we had a dog and a cat. I was having my oldest son come by during the day since I worked nights to come walk my dog a few times a  day. Well I didn't know that we weren't allowed to have guest over with their own pets. I figure he could walk his 2 small dogs with my 1 larger puppy. She went all postal and threw me and my younger boys out. We just lost our home and we are homeless. One of my boys is autistic. Been trying to get to understand what had happened and I don't even know what happened.  Crystal needs help. She even scream at me about my son.<//Text>

Worst place I have ever stayed. I'm embarrassed for myself for even booking this place. Used a third party app for a cheap and quick trip. Chipped paint, two inch gap under the door (hear every footstep outside),  lacks even the basic hotel qualities such as washclothes, hair dryer, drinking glass, there was dirt in the shower( I showered with my shoes on),  grease cover on the walls, no top sheet on a bed made by just putting a new fitted sheet on top of the old one. Yes I checked.  This is not a place for a short term traveler. Only upside is that I have a getto story to tell my friends. If I walk out of here without bed bugs it will be a miracle. Paid for two nights ahead of time, but only staying one. Blame myself for not understanding the nasty underbelly of this industry. There are families living here long term.... This is their home; as gross and crappy as it is. This place IS NOT A PLACE FOR  SHORT TIME TRAVEL...IT IS TEMPORARY HOUSING FOR THE DISPLACED.<//review>

Louis the night clerk had auditing to do and it was a sunday night Christmas. The internet callcenter mad a mistake on the reservation and tried to fix it. The hotel said no they want another 15 dollars because the manager wouldnt override the transaction. Poor quality customer service. Went to room I did not want and the bed was not made the dirty sheets where still on the chair and the trash was not taken out. Room was still dirty. The room we finally got was not better the room door wouldnt fully close the heater was broken and the door knob on the bathroom door broke and was stuck in the bathroom for a good 10 15 mintues. It just was a very bad christmas coming from this hotel. Not only that the night clerk left early and a husband and wife came right before they closed to find out there already closed.<//text>< pics>

We made reservations for one Extended Stay and even called it to verify that we will be arriving late. They confirmed that our room was ready for us, but an hour later they called us back and moved us to a different one that was further. We got there and one of our rooms smelled like weed and the other smelled like mold. We asked if we would have bath tubs and the front desk said yes, both rooms have tubs. Well the tub I had was dirty (you could watch the dirt run down after you turned the water on) and the other room had a handicap stall for a shower! Better yet, when you turned on the handicap shower, the water would actually flood the whole bathroom floor, it didn't even run to the drain correctly. The ceiling above my shower was chipped and falling apart, there was a large crack in our toilet, and one of the light bulbs in our room was burnt out. You're better off staying at a Motel 6.< /Text>

<review>I am on day four of living in a construction zone. With no warning and absolutely no attempt at making this palatable for guests, the hotel decided to repave the entire parking lot area. This involved moving my car in the middle of the night every night for a week, which is an inconvenience but not a deal-breaker. The deal-breaker is every morning at a quarter to 8am I awake to a cloud of rancid smoke that permeates the room and gives me a migraine, and enough racket to wake the dead. When I asked for a room that might be a little farther away I was treated as if this was an insane request. As an extended stay corporate guest I have two needs of this room: space to sleep and work. Under these conditions I cannot do either and management is oddly impervious as to how this might be an opportunity for them to actually resolve a hospitality issue.<//review><Resp>None< /Resp></record>

<text>Paid $100 and what I was greeted with was hairs on the pillows and stains on the sheets as you can see by the photos. I stayed for about 4 hours and that's all I could bear. When asked upon checkout how it was I told them the situation and they found it surprising and offered nothing. This was by far the most run-down cand creepy hotel I have ever stayed at. Do not stay here.</text>< Pictures>

I reserved a room at this hotel for two nights on Priceline. When I got to the hotel after driving 2.5 hours, I was told that the hotel was overbooked and that I would have to contact Priceline because, and I quote the employee at the front desk, "It's on them (Priceline), not us". I would have probably believed her if this hadn't happened to me before when I used Priceline to book my hotel room at Extended Stay. Granted I'm not 100% sure whose fault it was overbooking the hotel however, I have used Priceline many times before at different hotels and never once had this problem. Being that this is the second time I have encountered this issue using Priceline to book a room with Extended Stay I can only come to the conclusion that the problem with overbooking lies with Extended Stay. Besides being extremely inconvenienced, the front desk employee could have been a little bit more empathetic and helpful but she was neither and I do not think I will be staying at Extended Stay stay anytime in the future.< /text>

That's only because you put cash value customers thru more than what it's worth. But 5 stars on everything else you have to offer. The room was nice very spacious and pleasant without all argument thru the walls. Breakfast in the morning is the right way to go.<//review>

While I was happy with the location and the staff was friendly, the hotel itself was pretty scary.  We checked in, went to our room and my 10 year old daughter went in to the bathroom--as I was noticing there was only one pillow, she called out to me, um mom, there is blood on the floor.  Sure enough there was quite a bit of blood on the floor, the bathtub was covered in something pink (unsure if mildew or residual blood--hoping for the mildew as the whole tub was pink) and there were no towels. I really wish I had thought to take pictures, but was more concerned with getting out of the room.  I called down to the office and was told he would find me a new room, which he did, but it was only marginally better--at least there was no blood.  Pillows were completely flat, room was very dingy, parts of carpet were wet, and my daughter had a hard time falling asleep.  Will never stay here again or recommend it to anyone.  I felt extremely bad that I had booked my daughters coach in the same hotel.< /text>

This place is absolutely disgusting. The front desk ladies were absolutely lovely and so so helpful because they thought that they were sold out (every though I made my reservation directly through their website) so they had a room that was off rotation for repairs put back into circulation and gave me a room and just had that room fixed for a later guest. I super appreciate that since almost all of Sacramento is sold out right now! I don't appreciate boogers on the wall, hair all over everything and the comforter looks so dingy I'm scared to even sit down let alone sleep, I think I will be heading to Walmart for some new blankies 😬< /Text>

Even though I'd already paid for it, i couldnt get a room there and it was already 11:20p! Talk about disappointment and frustration! I called priceline too and they couldnt find a room for me anywhere from there to sac metro, even davis! Ill be expecting my money back for that but my point is that regardless of who sold it, the property should be in better communication with their booking partners so that the inconvenience of sleeping outside in my car whn, that night, the temp dipped below freezing! I was, and still, am not impressed by this service. On the bright side, it wouldve been a convenient location. Right off of I-80 and close to the I-5.</Text><response>None< /response>< username>

We did further research and discovered more under the refrigerator.

< Review>
Wish I could give 0 stars.. worst extended stay I've ever stayed at! I'm checking in at the front lobby and the staff was yelling curse words and slamming things due to not wanting to work or clean rooms. Very unprofessional! The room had broken cabinets and the bed, covers and pillows didn't look clean enough to sleep on! I will NEVER go back to this location!</Review>

<review>Price was good but most of the lighting in the room didn't work, the electronics all malfunctioned (ie. Sound coming from the tv after turning it off, alarm going off at 12 am despite no alarm being set.) The room was cold because the device to adjust the actual unit was broken. The bathroom was gross and didn't provide a hairdryer like most hotels. Was planning on staying a week but after 1 awful night, will be going elsewhere.<//review>< Pictures>

<text>I was dropping someone off her while driving for Lyft and was waiting for the passenger while a random person was on their phone about fifteen or twenty feet away. He was describing to a dispatcher how his car was broken into and how the guy that did it was someone who lives at the hotel that he deals with on a regular basis for stuff like that. Guy I picked up was nice enough, but the place seemed like it had a lot of people trying to get back on their feet or limited options for housing. Wasn't 100% comfortable going there. The one in South Natomas is a bit worse and in a really weird, put of the way kind of location.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Horrible.  Cockroachs,  room wasn't clean,  outdated, limit channels, manger unprofessional very disrespectful,  charges cards with consent adds charges and double charges. Talks about employees and guests.  Sends employees to do her dirty work and guests. Wouldn't go back even if it was last place on earth would rather stay in a box.< /Review>

We booked our reservation for May 5th, but didn't end up getting to the room til around 1am May 6th, so they were unable to check us in because they already had done the audits. Which meant we couldn't use Wi-Fi. I asked about breakfast, what time it was. The guy who was working the night time, who was very friendly & apologetic said they didn't leave him the key for it in the morning but he went to the back & brought us back some muffins.The employees were very friendly. The girl in the morning said since we checked in on Sunday, our price was less. The bed was ok, not too comfortable though. Thank you for the awesome customer service though.<//review>

I booked a room here for two nights and right after i checked the reviews and they where all bad I did not see a single one. So I thought I’d call to ask about the hotel just Incause it might not be all that bad as the reviews saying they are to avoid canceling and paying a fee. When I called the person who answered the phone was soooooooo rude she answered the phone saying “what is that you want” then when I asked her about the reviews and asked her was it decent and clean she told me she didn’t have to answer my question and that “you don’t have to come here” so I canceled my reservation and went to a different extended stay lol< /review>

<text>Worst motel I have ever been to in my life. We walked in to the hotel lobby and there was a prostitute trying to get a room with cash and arguing with the hotel lobby person. We then had to wait to get into our room and it was 530pm and check in was at 4.....we then got into the room and my friend noticed a small cockroach. We killed it. We then started to look around and they were EVERYWHERE in the room. There were dead ones on the floor and live ones on the walls. It was the most disgusting room I have ever seen in my life and for $99 I would have rather sleep in my car. DO NOT STAY HERE. I would have to rate this 0 stars. I then went to the Marriot and it was beautiful as usual. We were only staying in town for one night thankfully. But once again do not stay at the extended stay unless you want to be sleeping with bugs crawling all over you.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

I wish I had read the reviews before I booked this room. It’s disgusting don’t stay here! I found roaches in the room and one was on me when I woke up. the carpet is disgusting and stained all over the refrigerator was dirty. There was no tissue in the room they were no face towels. Worst room I’ve ever stayed in. I booked a king size bed but when I got here they said there were only queens available and that they often overBook. I picked up phone to call the front desk to complain about how bad the room was and look how disgusting the phone was.</Text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Review>Quite possibly the worst hotel I've ever stayed in. I chose the hotel for the kitchenette but when I checked in and asked for dishes I was told that they were out of dishes. So then what did a pay for? A kitchen with no dishes? When I got to my room it was quite unpleasant inside. Housekeeping was just leaving when I arrived, yet it looked like this room hadn't been properly cleaned in months. There are stains all over the floor. Big, dark, highly-visible stains from who-knows-what. All the furniture felt sticky and grimey. There was a layer of soap scum in the tub that looked like it hadnt been cleaned in years and I found human hairs in the bed and the tub. Also, the door didnt fit in the frame properly, so there was a crack near the bottom that let in cool air and noise and light. The outside of the hotel was just as nasty as the inside. When you exit your room you are hit with a smell of refuse, garbage, cigarette smoke and reefer. So that was nice. The garbage cans on the stair wells were constantly overflowing and leaking garbage and waste for my entire stay. At the end if the first night I went back to the front desk to see if they had more dishes ready and I was told the only thing they had available was a single skillet. Just a skillet. Thats it. No other utinsels or dishes. So I wasn't able to eat a real dinnrr that night necause I used my whole budget on groceries that needed to be cooked. Using the kitchenette that I paid for you know? But all I had was a skillet. So that night I sent an email to the customer service office and told them the issue. The next day the girl at the front desk (I think her name was Whitney) gatherred some dishes for me. She seemed to be the only person here who actually cared to do her job, so thank you Whitney. Soon after the manager called me to address the email I had sent. They said they would credit me $20 for my trouble (never saw that money...) And that they would send housekeeping to do a deep cleaning on my room on Tuesday at 10:00 AM so I should put all my personal belongings in a corner so they wouldn't be in the way. I did as instructed and waited. By 11:30 I finally left to run my errends for the day. Housekeeping never came to my room for my entire 8 day stay. I had to ask Whitney for extra towels (again, thank you Whitney). After this exoerience, I will never stay with Extended Stay America again. This hotel was not worth the money I paid.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

The customer severe at this location is super! We were traveling from Texss to Seattle with my elderly mother. We had made a reservation at Quality Inn nearby but that turned out to a very nasty stinky place. So we went over to this Extended Stay with no reservation. Tavi was so very helpful in finding a way to accommodate my husband and I as well my elderly mother. This was not easy since there was no double bed rooms available and no roll away beds. We had a very very restful stay. Then at check out the next mornin Jennifer was very very cheerful and interested in helping in any way she could.< /Text>

Dirty carpet, Gross  kitchen area, tiny rooms, smelly/smoky rooms (we tried 2),  limited breakfast (but at least you can grab and go), toilet lid is "chewed" up (?),  limited wifi, unlevel floor (2nd floor), unkempt grounds, unsightly building, and even the elevator seems unsafe. I expect to see roaches, but I haven't yet. Not worth the discounted 3rd party vendor price at all!  Not worth $10 a night!  I hope these nice employees can find jobs for a better corporation! There are better hotel chains down the road for $5 more a night.<//text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

If no stars was an option, I'd select it. My wife and I were here for less than 15 minutes. There was a smell about the entire property that you couldn't explain. It was dirty. Our door was wide open when we got to the room and it reeked. The sheets were stained. Go somewhere else.</text>

One of the worst motel experiences ever...My wife and friends were comped a free stay at this location due to a mix-up at another Extended Stays. Parking lot dirty and unkempt when we pulled in. Trash, cigarette butts, and vehicles with broken, taped up windows. Signs posted everywhere to lock vehicles and owners not responsible for any theft or damage. Several patrons in the parking lot looked like they lived in their cars most of the time and others seemed to be they worked out of their cars. There were even signs posted by the local authorities with warnings. The office girls were nice, but looked at us as if we were out of place. We clearly didn't fit the look of their regular clientele. If you are into illegal activities and have no sense of smell or cleanliness, this it the place for you. It got even worse once we got to our rooms. We had two rooms and both smelled of dog urine, possibly human urine, weed, cigarettes, and musty/mold. Dirty, smelly, stained carpets. Stains on the linen. Several female neighbors seemed to be soliciting their services while their male counterparts guarded the doorways. We feared we would not be able to stay the night without getting robbed, shot, stabbed, bedbugs, communicable diseases, or all of the above! We immediately called the main line to get our rooms back at the other location and deal with the issues there, but they had already given our rooms away. No idea why they sent us here other than that the management is in on illegal activity and taking advantage of suckers like us. DO NOT STAY HERE! WE ARE CHEAP, AND WE WOULDN'T EVEN STAY HERE FOR FREE!!!<//Text>

Last month I stayed there Sunday - Friday two consecutive weeks. I was a guy traveling on business without my family. It was reasonably clean and safe. Right next to the highway and next a reasonably priced grocery store. My first week on the top floor I got a good room. My only problem was that dishes don't come in the room but you ask for them. My first morning I ask and was told they would be delivered that AM. After work I had to ask again and they gave me a pile of dishes and a coffee maker to carry up so I could make dinner.

The breakfast is pretty sparse having granola bars, apples, oranges and oatmeal packets. The problem is most mornings the oatmeal was only regular flavor with nothing but the coffee sweetners to put in it. They had light roast, dark roast and water for tea or hot chocolate. No decaf but I could make it in my room when I had a coffee maker.

The second week I was on the middle floor. Still clean but I could hear every footstep above me and the recliner was broken. As I was checking in on Nov 1st I ask why they were sold out and was told it was Welfare check day and they always fill up that day. As I was unloading my cart I had a guy walking the hotel (rooms open to outdoors) offering to sell me a $10 "new" leather jacket. I almost flashed him my badge but he moved on when I said no.

I did have trouble getting dishes again. I got most the day of check in but was told there were no coffee makes available. Not a huge deal to head back to the police academy the next day with no decaf and got it the next day when I ask.  In this room I also had toilet problems that resulted in being handed a plunger from the desk at first, a visit by mantience the next day and getting to keep the plunger the rest of the week when problems returned.

That week we also had the Internet go out around lunch and it took them about 48hrs to get it up and working. Xfinity came out on that second day. At home when I call Xfinity in the evening they have fixed it that night or in the AM at the latest. I just upped the data on my cell. Cost a few bucks but with the cheap hotel price I was still ahead.

Overall I am rating it 3 stars as it was clean, safe, close to the police academy and cheap. It's no 3, 4 or 5 star hotel experience but it's an inexpensive place to stay. If you want the 4 star hotel you can pay $125/night in that area but I paid $75 with taxes and dealt with these things. I would still go back for the cost savings.<//review>

My family and I have stayed at these hotels in the past and they were great, but this one is by far the worst experience we had. When we got here and checked in at 9 o'clock at night our room was dirty, and really worn down. So we moved into another room, it wasn't that much better but we dealt with it.<//text>

One word....NASTY.  Feels like I'm in the projects.  Floor in my room was not vacuumed.  Bathroom has stains on the counters and tub.  And the corner of my dresser/tv stand was scotch taped to hold it together.  I checked out the next day.....looks nothing like the photos they post on the internet.</Text>

The room was only partially cleaned. There was dried toothpaste and spit on the bathroom counter. There wasn't a blanket on the bed. The floor wasn't vacuumed very well. There was no microwave, coffee maker, or dishes. There was an iron but no board. There was barely any toiletries.</review>

Cock roaches, bad plumbing, pictures falling off the wall are just the start. The clerk Travara, screws married men that stay there, another clerk provides weed to guests and a pimp provides hookers rooms to use. Pang the manager is ok with it all and even discriminates against the disabled. Wouldnt stay there again if it was free.<//review>

Sad that people that work here are to worried about making friends here than be professional and to do there job and be honest instead of ducking and dodging people and making excuses to not come in to work if your management isn't going in to work than your workers will do the same by your example Stacy Elliot you couldn't be me on your best day! And pang watch your back Stacy is gunning for your job!!!! 💯</Review>

<user_id>None</user_id><Review>The hotel is very dirty. There are trash cans filled with garbage that doesnt appear to be emptied consistently (pregnancy tests, used condoms, etc were all seen). There were a LOT of people parked at the hotel and living in their vehicles with their pets. The rooms smell bad. We stayed in a non-smoking room and the smell (not cigarette smell) was horrible. We had to cover our nose in order to sleep. The pillows cases were wrinkled/creased as if they had just been used. There was visible stuff on the carpet that could have easily be vacuumed up. There were no towels in the bathroom and there was an open/used bar of soap sitting on the counter. I had an Expedia coupon so we only paid $30 for this $80 hotel and even then I feel that we paid too much. We checked in really late so we decided to not leave in the middle of the night but would have probably been more comfortable sleeping in our car. I do not recommend this hotel and I will not be staying at a Stay America again.<//Review><date>1507075200000<//date></record>
