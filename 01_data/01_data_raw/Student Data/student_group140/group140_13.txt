<Time>1621198854694<//Time><Rating>1< /Rating><text>This place used to be really good before the pandemic. Now, the food quality has been downgraded considerably.

Also, they charge for extras that they serve for free in ordinary plates. For example: the burrito comes with beans inside of it. However, if you ask for extra beans, they charge for them and you don't get beans inside the burrito. I mean, why would you charge for something "extra" that comes ordinarly with the plate?

And they say all burritos comes with eggs. But when you order a burrito, they serve you a "veggie" burrito. That's weird and not cool at all.</text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN44XGnnRoi2RJbWA4HeB0afLfUjEex7xDPhPZI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOy2zVBV1mx5aCu_gZlvCBifZQzg9u6g5TGba0i=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNnFUCMWmxjA6wjwwOwClwJMgDnDFY7r8Ray72T=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

<review>This coffee shop is not only a café...  But a local La Jolla institution!

It is a great place for a well deserved break in your busy schedule, to sit, lounge, and relax... or simply to pick up a delicious goody to eat or drink.

Located in the commercial district of LJ, and very near to the not to be missed La Jolla Cove Park, you can then do some strolling, shopping, and then finish your afternoon immersing yourself in the boundless natural beauty of this park!

We highly recommend Pannikin for sure! Stop by to relax and enjoy!< /review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPvXHeWbmrP9ZXCoT7U3JLAygJALCw8yOqPXMxA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOpZkUm7stVFmiUZ9S-i3HVcNWzX-PbxjYSePxJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPnmw3gMBjU-C4_01ljh_F8TGVaI2dSMtqRWi9I=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNkyvnomPkoRfkF9x_iHrbTaZ10QkUP9M43P1ai=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPJzCVlAecHslMmq7FK4YDERLY8OVUJZD0hPx9z=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< response>

<Review>Love their Vietnamese coffee! Decent coffee,  their breakfast and lunch menu items are simple and delicious! Great outdoor seating in the sunshine next to a cool old bookstore, close to the farmers markets on Sundays, and not too far from the La Jolla Cove. Cutest cottage/garden setting too!!!!!< /Review>< pictures>

So this place used to be cool, but about a month ago we came back after sometime and my Girlfriend ordered a Sandwhich after reading that it had egg and cheese after the sandwhich came it was only a veggie sandwhich. We thought it was strange and that maybe we did ask for it.

Second part: today I came to Pannikin with some friends that where visiting the area, we all ordered burritos, and to the surprise of us out of 4 burritos each one had a diferent build: one had eggs inside (did not mention or ask for it as the menu said), second one had veggies, third one had veggies and beans (not asked for),and mine was also a veggie burrito and got charged for beans and papas, so it shows a lack of coordination.

We will not return after coming here for the past 15 years, this place fell off.</text>

<date>1618542005001<//date><review>The person at the cash register was really rude, and wouldn't remake my sisters drink. The worker said they could add more milk, but would have ti charge to make another drink, because that's was she asked for. My sister just didn't like the way it tasted, she never said she didn't ask for that specific drink. They called in their manager and they said that they couldn't remake the drink without charging, because they didn't want to waste the expresso. Just a really odd experience.<//review></record></dataset><record>

im almost nervous to share this spot cuz its such a GEM. lemme start by saying theres parking lol yep. sold. i know right?? and the decor is a hipster-but-not-too-hipster-snug with these rugs on the walls that are great for my back. coffee is great, the service is SO NICE and theres outlets, wifi (although it gets laggy when more than 3 laptops are out), and outdoor little garden seating area if you wanna up the romantic chill vibessss<//Review>

Coffee is 100% Amazing!!! I got a vanilla latte and the espresso is incredibly smooth, so so good! However - their food is not so great. I got a breakfast sandwich with eggs, bacon, & cheese..flavorless, unfortunately. Will try again tho!< /text>

Was going to give this place a 4 because the wait staff kept getting our order wrong, but the place redeemed themselves with amazing coffee. Kudos to the barrista and their excellent espresso pull. Coffee was so good and rich that I didn't even need or want to add milk to it!<//text>

Great coffee made by hearty baristas. What is even better is the ambiance, a true San Diego experience of outdoor seatings, finches visiting, country and artsy decor with newly painted wall mural draping behind one beautiful tree awning.</Review>

This Place is great! They have very Good Organic coffee and some Organic soups from local vegetable. The place is very sweet and cozy. Only internet is for limited time (60min), so it is not really a working place, but it's more a hangout type of place.< /review>

<review>Pannikin is doing an A+ job with the COVID-19 situation and turning out delicious food and drinks. Also, I would like to shout out to Wildwood Flour which makes a freaking amazing sour dough sold at Pannikin. I've never been a huge fan of sour dough but this morning I was a 10/10 hungry, saw the bread, had it with some butter and fried egg at home and now I'm not looking back and I'm on the sour dough train.</review>< Pics>

Ive been coming here for 40 years. Always the best place to sit and enjoy a cup of amazing coffee and crunch on a pastry. This cute old village bungalow is a community landmark that employs locals as they continue the heritage of funky little coffee shops that matter.<//Review>

Cute place though to be honest. 3 stars based upon the food and not so great service.  Maybe I ordered incorrectly. All I wanted was lox and an everything bagel. Instead they served me a plain bagel and loads of fruit and a small side of salmon. It was very weird. And it wasn't cheap. Coffee was good. Great if you want to enjoy the local flavour as it was filled with locals and their dogs trading surfing stories.<//Review><GmapID>0x80dc03e3e19b5421:0xccea94c120e54f5b< /GmapID>< user_id>

< Review>
Ordered hot chocolate this morning. Served up in mug with large crack in it. Took it back to counter to get replacement in contamination free receptacle. Met with looks of amazement when asked what the problem was. Response was - all our mugs have cracks in them as we throw them in the dishwasher - is that a problem?

Obviously in this particular part of La Jolla hygiene isn’t top priority.

I am visiting from U.K. where our health service is under pressure, but serving food or drink in cracked crockery is absolute taboo in any eatery, no matter how modest.

No doubt there’s no such thing as global warming here either...</Review>

A small place with a big menu! Lemon poppy seed scone was so tender. Carrot pineapple muffin had a good texture and was light on the sweet. Coffee was served quickly and was spot on. Eggs were cooked perfectly and the salsa was fresh, spicy, and the perfect addition to the huevos rancheros and burrito. Tortillas were served warm and thin.<//Text>

Lovely coffee house. Quality coffee ( appropriately expensive ), broad and varied selection of teas, fresh pastry ( incl vegan ), good breakfast fare. And above all, a warm atmosphere with frequent dogs and bad WiFi ( unironically a plus ). In other words, the perfect coffee house.</review>

I love this place! Great soy latte and love their bran muffins.
The egg steamers are not seasoned but they are yummy. Get the salsa for some kick.
A huge plus is that the staff is super friendly and fast in serving us our bean juice.<//Review>

<text>I'm from Seattle and I'm very picky about my coffee. This is the first coffee shop I've tried in southern California that meets my expectations. Excellent coffee! They have really good soup too. I would definitely come back. Parking is a bit tricky but it's worth it for a visit here.</text>< pictures>

Absolutely LOVELY little shop with a good selection and classic, comfortable cafe atmosphere. Don't go during the day if you dislike birds though. There are tons of adorable little finches (I think, but I'm no ornithologist) who will come say Hi and maybe try to steal some food< /review>

I was there yesterday and so excited to have lunch with my boss. First of all the lady didint understand my accent (I've studied and worked in San Diego over 10 years) after couple repeated my boss order veggie burrito and quesadilla. However We had cheese quesadilla and I went to say the mistake and show receipt the another lady asked me you mean no vegetable in???? She didint say sorry or apologize and came back 5 min later to tell us that they will replace veggie quesadilla, no sorry again. Eventually we had cold lunch. We were splitting them, asked her to can I get two plates to share it. Her attitude was like I am wrong, didint look at my face and say nothing. When I said thank you even she turned her face and walked away. So ruined my Sunday, lunch and felt kinda discrimination because of my accent. If you have accent good luck guys. For me no more!!</Text>

Great breakfast and coffee.   Fantastic pastries.   The morning we were there there was no tables available inside because of people studying but not eating.  I had a tuna melt.   It was ok except for the hot peppers mixed in the tuna.  Stop doing that please.<//review>

They have a lot of tea variety. Great coffee menu. Their pastries that they have are okay. The place looks like an old house converted into a coffee shop so it is really cozy and rustic. The porch is a really nice place to sit and people watch.<//text>

This is the first place I went to when I got out of jail. 6 long years behind bars and all I could think of was the hot chocolate. 6 months before I got out I was drawing mad envelopes so my boys on the outside could put cinnamon roll funds on my books you feel. Those rolls were the light at the end of the tunnel, they were what got me through my time. You know, man's not hot, but the fire food here got me sweating.</text>

Whether you have work or chatting to do, pop into Pannikin for a coffee and enjoy the cozy atmosphere.

Excellent, extensive selection of teas with knowledgeable staff. I had a lovely, loose - leaf Victoria Fog, expertly prepared. It is far from the choice of 4 Tazo tea bags tossed into the scalding hot water of an enormous cup that you get at many coffee establishments.</Review>

The muffins!!! Every time I come to La Jolla, I have to stop by Pannikin to get one of their amazing muffins. The blueberry banana bran is the best, not too sweet, chock full of nuts and bran, and the best thing to pair with a cortado. The baristas are so friendly and the vibe is laid back and relaxed.< /text>

One of the few places in San Diego I've been to recently where I got a distinct European vibe. I really enjoyed the old styled coffee and outdoor seating, watching the sparrows and enjoying the La Jolla scenery.< /Review>

<Text>Not being much of a coffee drinker, Pannikin managed to win over my taste buds and give me a serious morning jolt with the Keith Richards - 4 shots of espresso with steamed Mexican chocolate milk - wow!

Grab a coffee and check out the farmer's market just down the block on Saturdays!

The cookie I got to go along side my beverage was delicious as well. And on my way out, their enormous steamer wand caught my eye - they use it to steam cook their scrambled eggs - a unique preparation I can't wait to try on my next visit.<//Text>< gmap_id>

<Review>I love the Pannikin! Great food and coffee, one of the few places that doesn't burn the heck out of the coffee and scald the milk. They can make a cafe macchiato like an Italian bar.

Loads of study space and free WiFi inside and out. Very cozy and friendly atmosphere.

Note: Single toilet bathroom in a very busy place.<//Review>< Pictures>

Wish we had coffee shops like this back in Charleston, SC. There are a few that come close but really can't match the vibe and atmosphere this place has. Was in the La Jolla area for a wedding for 5 days and made it out to this location 3 times. The coffee was surprisingly really good as well. If I were a local I'd be out here every day if I could.<//text>

<text>I like Pannikins.  This one is okay.  Don't eat the gluten free muffins or you'll get sick if you're celiac.  They are delicious, but there is a major cross contamination issue at this Pannikin.  Coffee is okay.  Good non-corporate place to get caffeine and then walk down to the Cove and watch the seals attack the tourists.  Good times.<//text>< pics>

< review>
Pannikin has lost a few locations, but the owners of the La Jolla location have really invested time and love into maintaining the character of this cult favorite. I can't tell you how many of my childhood weekend mornings started here, checking the classifieds over hot chocolate (now the house blend or a "hammerhead" will do!) and chatting with locals... including a few Padres players over the years! The chess board, the gigantic carrot cake cupcakes behind the case, and tempting soups and Mexican breakfast items are often the only things I missed while living abroad or while suffering through my college years in LA. If you really want the full story on why I love this place you'll have to meet me, but in my mind, Pannikin is an institution and a family favorite that can do no wrong. My late mother's ashes are here and I will always find an excuse to enjoy a buzz with the resident sparrows as long as I live.<//review>

<Review>The place has a rustic, time-worn feel to it -- it's a creaky wooden building -- and the mismatched furniture adds to the casual atmosphere. I'm a fan.

On a side note, they serve lemonade from a 3rd party carton and it would've been better if it was fresh squeezed. Because, lemonade, man.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Name>Nico H</Name><response>None< /response><Date>1416122159727<//Date>< Gmap_id>

<pictures>None< /pictures><review>I feel so offended coming here after having amazing breakfast burritos in Colorado. The tortilla was cold and dry, no warming up done whatsoever. The potatoes inside were mashed instead of being "house roasted" like I was told. Seriously - who puts mashed potatoes in a burrito? The eggs were average, just some eggs. Avocado was just that, avocado. The cheese was cheddar, which doesn't belong on a breakfast burrito. And to top it all off, no seasoning was used anywhere in the burrito. It seems like there should more options for meat other than bacon, maybe sausage? Chorizo? Those are staples in breakfast burritos in Colorado. This seems like a burrito I would've made in middle school thinking it would be good but then realizing later how awful it was.

The coffee was alright, I had a cortado and I can't say I absolutely loved it or hated it.< /review></record>

My experience here was so negative with the employees allowing  A homeless lady to yell F you, the lady was trying to take their trash can.  The employee was rude to me when I asked  take control of the situation with the homeless lady. Two women Employees started yelling at me when I said dirty homeless lady. They asked me to leave when I paid over $15 at that café. The homeless lady was in their bathroom for over half an hour.  The employee cleaned after the homeless lady left with just a broom. And went back to the kitchen. I didn’t see that she washed her hands after cleaning the bathroom. This place needs to be sanitized. The seatings are dirty and sticky definitely a dirty place to eat and drink. Homeless people  read a lot of germs and diseases. Apparently Pannkin is okay with NOT Keeping their cafe sanitize.I told the  employees they should give out a cuppa coffee to the all the homeless people in La Jolla.  New homeless hang out.  One of the employees asked me to take care of the homeless lady.  This is their response when you asked them to take control of a bad situation At Pannkin. A dirty place to eat and drink In La Jolla.< /review>< Pics>

{'time': 1528230381711, 'text': 'Dear Celia Cossio,\nWe are so grateful that you care for your community and cleanliness as we do! Unfortunately, your choice of words and attitude lean deeply towards a non-constructive approach that we are unable to stand behind.\nWe understand that it is not your position to see the intricacies of taking care of an entire community for over 50 years as we have. We knew this particular transient person as a bright woman some years back, and, unfortunately mental illness has claimed her being. We have true relationships with many, many people in our close community, and compassion for all. We apologize that you did not see our staff, Franco, thoroughly clean and bleach the bathroom after she left. We keep our café extremely clean.\nBada Bada (the woman you are complaining about) is a paying customer whom we have asked to pay outside, and even offer her free coffee at the curb in order to keep her from lingering. These are complicated issues that we are always doing our very best to work with. Because we have experience with her (and others in our large transient community), we are aware of her patterns and know she tends to become more difficult to move when given too much attention. She is senile, old and ill, and police do not respond to calls on her as she is usually docile.\nLastly, we spoke with both of our female staff that you were speaking to, and recognize that you were rude and hostile to them, rather than constructive and helpful. One of the staff you spoke with has been working for the Pannikin for over 15 years, and the other for nearly three. We adore our staff as we do our community, and request that, moving forward, you look for kinder ways to handle difficult situations.\nWe respect your choice to not come back to the Pannikin, and encourage you to approach people that offend you (such as this little homeless lady) on your own in the future.\nBest wishes,\nAmanda and Gloria\nOwners\nPannikin La Jolla'}< /Resp>

Best coffee I've ever had.

I've had coffee in the Middle East, Europe, Mexico, and all over America and I can easily say that the quad espresso drinks they have are easily my favorite espresso drinks. I alternate between the Keith Richards (4 shots noir espresso/Mexican cocoa) and the Jimi Hendrix (4 shots noir espresso/caramel syrup/ Mexican cocoa). It's phenomenal< /text>

We haven't been in the area for a while so it was good to drop by for cappuccinos and a light lunch.It's always pretty crowded on Sundays around midday but you never wait long to get service.We got our coffees and a ham panwich on sourdough to share.It was nice to sit out the front on the patio and enjoy the atmosphere.The cappuccinos were pretty good and the sandwich was okay...their sourdough here is the same as the one at the Encinitas location....very dry,almost stale.I don't know why they don't use fresh ciabattas or something.The choice is sourdough or wholewheat only.We'll remember not to order a sandwich next time we are here otherwise everything is fine.<//Text>

Finally, the perfect coffee shop. Airy open air seating or cozy indoors. Free Wifi...heck WiFi without a password and for those out in the open, access points to plug in your power and internet sockets. Nice coffee and the greatest coconut pie I have ever had. A weekend novelist could ask for nothing more. However, the Ferrari showroom around the corner seems to be attracting really loud people. Small itch, anyway.</Text>

The coffee is good here and the pastries, but I was severely disappointed with the Avocado Toast...and that they ONLY serve Steam Scrambled Eggs. I love a nice and runny golden yolk.<//text>

(Translated by Google) Awesome cafe in the La Jolla area! Really cozy environment with an incredibly relaxed atmosphere. The cafe also has a fun corner with games and other things to do, so children also feel comfortable without disturbing other guests. The breakfast options are very delicious and really good. If you want to start the day in good spirits, then miraculously head to Pannikin for your morning coffee. The atmosphere and the friendliness of the staff are sure to catch on!

Mahtava kahvila La Jollan alueella! Todella viihtyisä miljöö, jossa on uskomattoman rento tunnelma. Kahvilassa on myös hauska nurkka, jossa on pelejä ja muuta tekemistä, joten myös lapset viihtyvät ilman, että muut asiakkaat häiriintyisivät. Aamupala vaihtoehdot ovat erittäin herkullisia ja todella hyvää. Jos haluat aloittaa päivän hyvällä mielellä, niin suuntaa ihmeessä Pannikiniin aamukahville. Tunnelma ja henkilökunnan ystävällisyys varmasti tarttuvat!< /text>

<review>Fantastic restaurant. Family owned, great environment, not too packed on a Thursday night, and excellent customer service. The food was served in a reasonable time frame and it was very delicious. 3 awesome micro brews on tap and excellent cocktails. Definitely lives up to all the other great reviews I read about the place. Eat at this restaurant if you are in the area. You won't regret it.<//review>< pictures>

I am not fan of Tex-Mex food (with all due respect), yet I can say here I had the best grilled veggies quesadilla ever. Perfect balance between the cheese, the veggies and the salsa on top. Their fajita was also very good. The place is really charming and they make you feel at home.< /Review>

We are old friends and patrons of Alfonso, and his original place in LaJolla Village. We finally took the short drive up to Solana Beach. New location is bigger, and not quite as intimate, but the food and service was spot on.< /text>

<review>Food is quite good. I was there for a special event, so I didn't order off the menu. There is a bar and while I didn't drink, the offerings ranged from beer to mixed drinks. We had the entire left side of the restaurant for this event, so they accommodate groups and they do a great job. Alfonso is there and he is happy to greet you as you come in and thank you for coming when you leave. Parking is free and there is a good sized lot. Bathrooms are clean and accessible. I'd go back ... even without a special event.< /review>< pics>

<review>I Have ENJOYED the WORLD CLASS FOOD AND PEOPLE from allover the World since 1976.
Alfonzo has been a Personal FRIEND since that Date.
Always Enjoyed the PROFESSIONAL
and FRIENDLY PERSONAL CARE OF HIS Staff!
MANAGEMENT ALWAYS WORLD CLASS, and Chefs Innovative With Old
World Tastes and Tendencies.
Bar always FUN however with Class and Consideration of Others.< /review>< Pictures>

The food is great. They have some typical American-ized Mexican food dishes, but they also have some authentic Mexican food, and some creative stuff in between. The service is good and the seating is great. Overall, I'm always impressed when I come here.< /text>

Some of the best Mexican food in San Diego. We've been patrons for over 30 years and it's always great. Tonight there was live music, and even Alfonso himself came to our table to make sure our food was good!</Text>

<Text>Taco Tuesday!

Wife and I stopped here for lunch on Tuesday about 12:30.

Had a nice table on the patio in the shade  out of the warm weather.  The waiter brought us thick chips and a thick salsa. Mmm, they are good, he brought mitre later.

It was taco Tuesday with a special additional menus, $3 tacos and a $4 large taco. $1.50 for guacamole and $8.00 for an 18 oz margarita.

We each had the large and I had a margarita. One taco was plenty big and tasted great. The margarita was good, with ice cubes and salt. It was $20 for the whole meal.

Service was good, they inquired several times how we were doing.< /Text>< pics>

The ambiance of this place is fun, service was good but food is very mediocre. Not sure how you can have a Mexican food restaurant that is supposed to be a little higher end with such mediocre food. Literally everything we ate from chips and salsa to guacamole to a burrito was really underwhelming. The fries fish taco was good but it's hard to mess up fried food. I'll take the hole in the wall places over this any day unfortunately.< /Review>

I think the chips were homemade and they were wonderful. Really enjoyed the salsa as well. The fish was fresh and cooked perfectly.</text>

Great Service and food was delicious.   We went on a Monday at noon.  Had their Margarita special along with some cheese enchiladas with rice and beans.  Was very good.  No complaints when we sat and chatted for quite some time after our meal was finished.  Planning on going back soon.  After lunch a 5 minute walk took us to the ocean walk for a breath of ocean air and a view of the waves.   Lovely day<//review>

It is my favorite Mexican Restaurant. Their food is wonderful and they have great margaritas. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. Their new location is nice because it is suited for large gatherings and social happy hours. When he makes an appearance, Alfonso, himself, goes around to each customer and greats them. I highly recommend trying this place. You will not be disappointed. Thank you Alfonso.< /Review>< Time>

<rating>1< /rating><Text>Shrimp Burrito break down:
1) Wet tortilla, not a very good tortilla, something you’ll find in the middle of the country not in southern Cali (frisbee style to give you a good picture)

2) Spicy but very spicy (the kind of spicy that will burn your mouth and make you forget about the tasteless food you eating)

3) Just 5 shrimp inside probably boiled

4) Uncooked tomatoes inside, onions and green bell peppers

5) lots of water inside (maybe from the frozen shrimps?)

6) Nothing on the plate except the sorry Burrito

7) All for $17.69

PS: Don’t squish the burrito, hot watery broth will splatter all over you.</Text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<Review>The only reason why they get 4 stars instead of 5 is because they made me peel my own shrimp. I had the carne asada and garlic shrimp lunch special here. The carne Asada was marinated very well. The Spanish rice was perfect. It wasn't under cooked or over cooked. The shrimp, though, was not very flavorful and they left the shell for me to peel. My biggest peeve when going out to eat. Makes me think the the cook was too lazy to take off the shell. Besides that, the service was great and the rest of my food was great.</Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMALJC1EFCIJyHJVE7h155Ut8V3wWQ9bHlnntAX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

This place had nice and creative decor. Upscale looking Mexican restaurant in a strip mall.  Waiter was friendly. Menu is overpriced for Mexican food. $9.19 for guacamole! Tacos were so so. Could taste oil used to get tortilla more than grilled shrimp.</review>

My husband ordered beef soft tacos and I got the enchiladas we both enjoyed the meal very much. Thier chips are very good as well.  The staff was friendly which is a real plus.

About the only thing that was a bit off was the house strawberry margarita.  A bit more like a strawberry slushy.</review>

We must have had our meal on an off night. Service was excellent; however  I ordered cheese enchiladas and I believe the cheese was missing on one. A warmed tortilla. Period. My husband ordered relleno and a cheese enchilada, there was very little difference between the two. It’s too bad because it’s a fun place and close to home.</Text>

<response>None< /response><Review>We went there to celebrate Father's Day. My wife and I have been to their location in La Jolla over the years.  We recall call them being great food and good service.  This is not the place it used to be.  Almost $10 for so so guacamole that is a small portion.  They used to make it at the table.  They screwed up my wife's grilled fish tacos and gave her fried ones.  She told the waitress and the waitress couldn't be bothered and was impolite about it.  Then in less than a minute, she brought back new tacos thrown on a plate.  They violated health code with giving the same plate and used limes and some other violations I'll be polite about.  I worked in the restaurant business to know this. It also takes more than a minutet to grill fresh fish. It takes at least 10 minutes on a slow day to get grilled fish tacos at Rubio's.  Rubio's is far more superior in quality and taste.  We asked to speak to a manager.  He looked like the busboy and was rude and yelled, "I'll get you all the limes you want" and stormed off. My wife felt sick from one bite. I ordered a tostada, got sick, and  it was a piece of hard tortilla with some lettuce, tomato, an once of guacamole, some horrible tasting beans, and almost no cheese.  I called to speak to the owner and they said he barely comes and the next thing I knew is his son was getting on the phone. I kid you not.  He answers the phone screaming while I was on speaker as  my wife heard him yelling, "What do you want?" I wouldn't be surprised if they are out of business.  They need Robert Irvine's help from Restaurant Impossible to teach them customer service and how to not serve lousy tasting food. Don't waste your money here. You're better off eating at Taco Bell.< /Review>< user_name>

Amazing food, drinks and atmosphere!  Our server was ever present without being overbearing, and they were so accommodating of small children.  Wish this was my local Mexican eatery, I'd be there every week!< /review>

In San Diego discussing Mexican food is akin to religious debate. At the risk of starting a family feud, I say newcomer Alfonso’s of La Jolla (now in Solana Beach) ranks among long time local institutions of Fidel’s and Tony’s. All three have there place. Only critique: chips are too thick (and music selection). Everything else is awesome, including the patio, vegan accommodation, their WiFi password and adding fresh chili pepper to your margarita (recommended). I imagine the SEO and branding are challenging, but this is not the proper channel for that discussion!<//text>

A true authentic family ran restaurant. The old man will come by the table and have a conversation and even tell you how to eat your food. The chips and salsa are wonderful. You could probably just fill up on those. The house Margarita is good. They have Modelo on draft. The tacos are amazing. I am running out of nice things to say about this place. I felt like home here and I didn't think I would have some of the best Mexican food here. #killingit</Review>

Alfonso’s is a rare treasure! Totally authentic Mexican foods. Everything is home made! Even the chips are home made- the salsa Fresca is superb, the grilled fish taco delish! The portions are generous. The staff are all courteous & inviting! The tequila Alfonzo imports from a life long friend that is in Mexico. They are clean, friendly & family run!
East access parking on the 101 & in the plaza- a bonus at the beach!  When i go to Alfonzo’s its Mi Casa Su Casa- feel ❤️<//text>

< Review>
Many restaurants claim to treat you like family but this one actually delivers on that promise.  The food has been consistently delicious for at the 35 years that I've been eating there and qhen they moved to Solana Beach they brought the original food and mellow vibe with them from La Jolla.  Despite their success, the owner remain very much present and truly embidies the word host.
The descor is warm and welcoming.  It's not fancy and they don't change the menu to follow the trend of the latest trends, but they start with good ingredients and know how to use them to create classic dishes like camarones mojo de ajo and sauteed fajitas, dishes that very few places do well anymore.
if you're not local, it's three minutes from the 5 to Highway 101, so why not pull off the Freeway and pull up a chair.  You won't regret it.<//Review>

I frequent here a lot as my SO's mother loves dining here. I am not a huge fan. Friendly service from the wait staff and on point. They accept reservations and the best place to sit is on the patio and not too close to the one man band station. Yes, they do have live music for you to enjoy.

They really need to work on some of their dishes though the queso fundido is served on a plate and sprinkles of chorizo, you can def provide more than that for the mark up on your meals. It would be much tastier in skillet or deeper dish to easily scoop up the queso. One night I ordered a Cali burrito, it tasted like it was previously frozen and microwaved, the fries was tough, cold, and disgusting. I had other dishes there, but don't remember because not as memorable.

The best dish so far I had there was the Steak Ranchero. I would get that again and just stick to what I know is good next time.

I don't really recommend this place unless you're going with friends and family that are footing the bill and love this place. I would rather go to a hole in the wall taco shop south of San Diego.</review>

One of the cheapest place I've been to. Everything is at $1. I went to buy stuff for birthday decoration but ended up buying lot of stuff. They have a good range of stationary, flowers, birthday stuffs, kitchen utensils, cards, toys, soft drinks. I completed loved this place. They also have helium balloons for many occasions. I highly recommend this place.<//text>

< review>
Just shopped at this location and bought some items in large quantities which requires the use of a cart to take the items to my car once checked out. The carts that are used within the store cannot be taken on the outside, as they have a long extended bar that prohibit this.There are no carts available for customers to take their items to their car and no one to assist them in doing so. Spoke with the manager who stated that they had a total of 4 carts which were all stolen. No refunds only exchanges are given. How and why should customers be able to shop when there is no accommodation for them to take their items to their cars??? I think that is very poor customer service. These were large bulky items, I had to make numerous trips to my car. Having to make several trips to you car is simple not good customer service and disregard for customers time and effort to patronize your business.<//review>

Much, much cleaner and better stocked than the majority of the dollar trees in San Jose.

It's not completely wheelchair accessible, they still have many boxes in the aisles, but it is at least navigable in a wheelchair.

This is pretty quiet location, rarely see many other customers while shopping. I go to all the dollar trees in the area, frequently.

This location is fairly large. It's slightly smaller than the one on union, but bigger than many, such as the one on Winchester.

There is a frozen section. Most items are standard, you will see them at every dollar tree. Lots of seasonal/holiday items in the front. Party supplies, cleaning supplies, greeting cards, makeup, toiletries, housewares, candy and snacks.</Text>

So the shelves in certain sections go empty near close on a daily basis! If they get a great deal, it would be gone in minutes verses a larger store! I only shop here because of convenience!< /Review>< time>

<text>Lots of stuff for a $1.00
Make sure to walk around and see everything you'll be surprised what you can find. I originally went to buy Rockstar in 12oz. cans for a dollar and ended getting other stuff. If you see something buy it because the next time your there it may be gone.
If your taking a road trip or going to an event stop here instead of a convenience store like 7-11 because you'll get way more for less money guaranteed.<//text>< Pictures>

It was hard to walk around the store. Empty boxes and merchandise littered the isle's. No one insight working. One clerk checking out with a line.</Text>

A bit small and messy but not that big of a deal. However, I went with 3 kids (one I was carrying) and bought lots of Halloween decorations and wrapping paper. As I went to load the bags into the cart the cashier informed me I was not allowed to take cart outside and came around and took cart from me and put back with other carts. She was short with me and my kids. And not helpful at all. Very difficult to carry everything to car without cart.<//review>

Sometimes, they seem to value their customers same as the price of an individual item in their store... Some employees are very friendly and helpful... a mixed bag ...< /review>

Fresh ingredients, thoughtful recipes and cooks that are quick on the grill make this place one of my favorites for take out. The marinades are delectable, and they occasionally put up an outdoor barbecue and do the street tacos thing.</Review>

Food is good, owner and staff is pleasent and kitchen/cooking area looks clean from what I could see. I tried a bunch of Mexican restaurants in the area but Jarrito's is my go to. Also on weekends they have the outdoor Toco Stand out front grilling up street tacos. Would have rated it a 5 except it's not in the best area 🤷‍♂️ personally that doesn't bother me but i probably wouldn't send my lady and kids there bye themselves after sunset.</text>

It was my first time there. My nephew said they have good food so I went on to try it. The Super steak and prawn burrito was good I must say but...when I got home and starting eating it I found they forgot to put sour cream on it. I was very disappointed, although overall yes, it was good I will be returning at a later date and telling a friend.< /Review>

My coworker got me hooked on this place.  Their prices are low but their quality of authentic Mexican food is incredible.  Lots of choices and options with a lot of seating within.  Only negative is that it is in a kinda shady shopping center and parking is limited.<//Text>

Very delicious 😋 Exceptional service; They never have messed my order up (they make my food vegan) A couple of times when me and my co-workers called in a head to dine in, they had saved us a table with our food ready😁<//Review>

<Text>Maybe they're under new ownership or have new cooks but the food is terrible now.. Taste like cleaning products.. Maybe they aren't rinsing the pots and pans good enough.. Back to back times I order carnitas and shredded chicken.. They give me grilled chicken instead of telling me they don't have shredded and both burritos get thrown away..<//Text><Date>1579892195191< /Date><resp>None< /resp><pics>None< /pics><Rating>1</Rating>< userid>

I brought my family after the Mello Yellow Nationals in Sonoma. Our experience was pleasant until we got the check. The amount was not an issue but when I requested a receipt I was handed register receipt that was printed light. All that was on the receipt were amounts per item, however when I requested the food items we purchased they could not tell me. I had 16 lines which included sub total and tax. I asked again for the actual food item purchased and they told me I need glasses! Really? You cannot provide a complete receipt with food item and amount it costs but I need glasses? I do not recommend this rude treatment to anyone. We will not be back!</Review>

<Review>I gave it 5 stars for the really delicious and authentic Mexican food cooked with quality meats. I would like to see an upgrade ro the interior it looks kinda run down, but the food is excellent. By far the best mex i every tasted, a little bit pricey but way worth it!</Review></record>

<Text>Ordered 3 burritos on today to go and waited over an hour to get the food.. crazy... there was no place to sit, management was all over the place and didn’t seem organized. Stood for the entire hour and was told by the manager to stand somewhere else, you’re blocking the line.. what crazy service and such a terrible leadership.< /Text>< Pictures>

< Review>
Likely the best Mexican restaurant in Fairfield - everything is delicious!  Street tacos, tortas, tostadas, horchata... the menu is large, and many menu items have a unique twist.  You can fit the family (it's larger than it looks from the outside), but if you come at the busiest times you may have a harder time finding a seat.  This place is popular with Hispanics.</Review>

<Review>The place was dirty, garbage and dishes were stacked up everywhere. The tables were not clean. Waitress was rude, handed us the menus and didn't give us time to look at it, took our drink order and said we had to order our food at the same time. Food was flavorless and far too expensive for what we ordered. This was our first time visiting and will definitely be our last.< /Review><Date>1570498252612</Date>< gmapID>

<text>I love this place. If you looking for some damn good tacos, come to this place!
You won't be disappointed..... or at the very least 9 times outta ten you won't be.
If you ever seen the guys that have a food card in front of the restaurant making the tacos, they are the bomb!
They know how to make some damn good tacos LOL!!!
All the other foods are good too, however.... the tacos taste so much better when the guys that have the stove cart (outside in front of the restaurant) are cooking it. Enough said, Tacos tacos tacos baby!< /text><Resp>None</Resp>< pictures>

Eat here, the food is cheap and delicious. Full of in house cooks that have a knack for delivering quality cooked and seasoned meats in tacos or burritos. The workers and owners here deserve to flourish with their attention to detail and consistent deliverance of quality.<//text>

Some of the best tacos around Solano County. Customer service could be a bit better. They lack organization and sometimes take a while but the food makes it worth the wait. The tacos from the truck are faster then food inside. The hand made tortilla quesadillas are a must.</review>

Great food, service is ok. They will get your order and drinks and that's it lol So if you don't like getting bothered every 5 minutes by the waitress this is the place for you. You will even have to go to the register to pay the check, so dont expect it to come to you. Other than that the food is awesome and doesn't take long to come out. Enjoy!<//Review>

It was too noisy. Also, burrito go a little lighter on meat. Instead of having cilanto by it self blend it with a pico de gallo salsa that way your burritos are moist.</Text>

Great place for Mexican mini tacos. They have great flavor taquitos suadero, tripa, lengua, chorizo, cabeza, etc. Their salsa or s fantastic also. No to mention the combination plates that rock too.
Prices are not that bad for the amount of food on the plates and their flavor!
Definitely I recommend this place for all the family but mainly for taquitos lovers!!!< /review>

The information here is incorrect this places closed well before 10PM.  I was there well before 9PM  and it was closed , chairs up and sign in the door.  I updated the hours on Google I hope they changed what they had I wasted a trip here to find it closed on Tuesday. I'm here now and the food is really good and priced reasonably.</review>

<gmapID>0x808515d26da03d79:0xfcb4bb2ab342e0d4</gmapID><review>Nasty. Ordered Carne Asada and got some tough piece of plain nasty meat. The rice and beans were iffy, and the lengua taco was maybe okay. I wanted to eat in and was put at a table and "forgotten" about. I was never even served water with my nasty food. I think I know exactly why my experience was so bad, but I really don't want to jump to conclusions. I'll just say, if you don't speak Spanish, you may not feel too welcome either.<//review></record>

<Review>I wait almost 40 minutes for my food. After several people went and gone with thier food. I ask for no avacados and if I could substitute it for sour cream. No we can't do that. Hmm charging for and item when I took off that and the pico de galo. I shouldn't have been charged at all. I get home to find I have maybe a teaspoon of refried beans. The other half some how got turned sideways into the other part of the container. Let's just say it much left of them. I'm giving them at least two stars because the gentleman as I was leaving says sorry lady. And the food was good for the wait.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x808515d26da03d79:0xfcb4bb2ab342e0d4< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Get the rice water (horchatta... not spelling it right) especially for americans that want to be ambitious and try new things. It was one of the best I have had in a while. The staff are funny. And food is always hot and fresh so I don't mind the wait. I seriously recomend this place and i have been told to be a bit snooty when it comes to people's food. So... yeah.

<review>This place is probably the closest resturaunt to authentic mexican food I've been to since moving to fairfield. Go here, and order the steak or chicken chimmichanga. I promise you won't be disappointed. Its a fast wait time and very clean. One of my top fave eats. Good luck!</review><Rating>5<//Rating><userid>109315386357119065531<//userid>< gmap_id>

This place has good food all they need now is good service. I made the simplest of orders, a quesadilla just cheese, guac and sour cream. Not only did they charge me $10.00 just for this (which I wouldn't/didn't mind paying) until I got home and realized there was chuncks of different meat in it and they didn't give me any sour cream. Which is crazy because the cashier even asked the cook if they could do that for me. This is just one of various occasions in which my order has been wrong. In all honesty not going back until they give better and more attentive service.< /review>

<rate>1</rate><Review>Food was just ok, the grilled onions that came with the tacos varied from warm to cold . . . .groooose! And the diced onions were a rough chop wich made the onions too strong. The food was bland and the salsas  were sweet; who wants to go to a mexican restaurant and get sweet salsa? The prices for me is expensive: $3.00 for a small taco. Will not come back! I recommend (Hecho En Mexico) in vacaville the taco grill is outside Fri. And Sat. 6pm-12a<//Review>< user_name>

(Translated by Google) The tacos are good. There is a cart outside that is placed, they are the ones that make the tacos. One can order take out as well. They have other dishes on the menu but I think this place is more popular for the tacos. They have Jamaican waters and horchata and they also have sofas, bottle coke for example. The only thing is that if it takes a while to serve the tacos but one is satisfied. Due to COVID, now you have to order first and then you can sit at any table that is available. They will take the order to the table and then if you want to order more they take the order there (open account).

Los tacos están buenos. Hay un carrito afuera que se pone, son los que hacen los tacos. Uno puede pedir para llevar también. En el menú tienen otros platos pero creo que este lugar es más popular por los tacos. Tienen aguas de Jamaica y de horchata y también tienen sofás, coca de botella por ejemplo. Lo único es que si se tardan algo en servir los tacos pero queda uno satisfecho. Por el COVID ahora tienes que ordenar primero y después te puedes sentar en cual quier mesa que esté disponible. Te llevarán la orden a la mesa y después si quieres pedir más te toman la orden ahí (cuenta abierta).< /Review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) The meat in the tacos was very parched as if it had been there all day. I ordered 2 tacos de suadero and the meat tasted like tap water, a very ugly flavor. They sell you the chips and salsa for a dollar but the chips they use don't taste good and the sauce isn't the best either. Strawberry water lacked sugar. I will not go to this place again nor recommend it. Nothing of flavor to Mexico has this place. The tacos are better from the lunchbox that is put in Vallejo next to Grocery Outlet Market attached to the freeway 80

(Original)
La carne de los tacos estaba muy reseca como si tuviera todo el día ahí. Pedí 2 tacos de suadero y la carne me supo a agua de la llave, un sabor muy feo. Te venden los chips y la salsa a un dólar pero los chips que usan no tienen buen sabor y la salsa no es la mejor tampoco. El agua de fresa le faltaba azúcar. No vuelvo a ir a este lugar ni lo recomiendo. Nada de sabor a México tiene este lugar. Están mejor los tacos de la lonchera que se pone en Vallejo junto a Grocery Outlet Market pegado al freeway 80< /Review><username>Gabby Pacas<//username><gmapID>0x808515d26da03d79:0xfcb4bb2ab342e0d4<//gmapID></record>

The staff is always welcoming and professional. They always make me feel comfortable. If you are afraid to go to the dentist, try this office. They will work with you to ease any anxiety you have.</Review>

HORRIBLE!!! Went to the dentist with NO pain and NO trouble chewing but she said I NEEDED a filling in which started hurting ANYTIME I chewed anything after that procedure. I went back to get it fixed and she said give it more time and that she won’t charge me again and makes sure it gets fixed at no cost which was NOT the case. I called again as I haven’t been able to chew AT ALL where the filling was done and she said that she will have to CHARGE ME again!!!! NOT ONLY SHE DOESN’T KNOW WHAT SHE IS DOING BUT SHE IS VERY RUDE AND UNPROFESSIONAL.< /Text>

<review>UPDATED -  This place made good on their previous poor service and has since provided me with a new flipper !! Thank you!

Original review:  Very disappointed in dental express. Three months ago after having a problematic tooth removed dental express made a prosthetic tooth for me known as a flipper. Upon receiving the flipper I mentioned to the dentist that I thought it was extremely thin and flimsy which worried me. He assured me that it was very durable and strong and Would last many years. Last week I snapped it in half while it was in my mouth with very little pressure from my tongue. When I return to dental express I was told that there was nothing that they could do unless I paid $500 for a new one as my insurance only covers one prosthetic tooth for every five years. In the Day of 3-D printers $500 is astronomical and greedy for a small piece of plastic. My disappointment is compounded by the fact that I warned the dentist that it didn’tFeel very durable when they first gave it to me and low and behold it broke.This is not taking responsibility for your actions and it’s absolutely not the right way to take care of a patient. Shame on you dental express!< /review>< Pictures>

<text>Chu chu ... Dental Express is a child friendly art deco decorated dentistry that has a super clean look. Service is top notch and very professional. They also have a fantastic large scale train making it's rounds around the different dental stations soothing all watchers... Highly recommended.< /text>< Pictures>

It was a very good experience at Dental Express. Everybody was super nice,  all the Dr.s and staff explained everything along the way which made it comfortable.
The waiting room was very big and very clean.  The best part was I didn't have to wait.  My appt. Was 1:15 and I was getting x-rays by 1:25. So that was great.<//text>

<Text>Dental Express is an amazing dental office. The employees are all very well trained. The staff are so patient an kind (even with frightened young children). I personally love this place and everyone who works here. The fact that they take their time to make sure that my children feel safe and comfortable means the world to me (and my kids). We all love the train table, the huge out door train that my kids like to "drive," and the train that travels overhead from room to room... But even if Dental Express did not have these fun extra things... We would come here just because they are good at what they do. All the fun train stuff is just an extra bonus :)</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Friendly, welcoming staff, exceptionally clean office, state of the art equipment, and most personal, caring and technically accomplished assistants, hygienist and dentist. Also, I was seen exactly at the time set for my appointments.  My concerns were discussed and addressed without hurry.
With pleasure I give the highest possible rating for a pleasant experience.<//text>

My family & I love coming to Dental Express. They are so welcoming & easy going. Brought my daughter here for her first exam. She cried most of the time cause she was scared but they were sure NOT to force anything on her that she didn't wanna do. They were very patient with her. We scheduled another one 6 months after, & what do you know? She wasn't scared at all & let them clean her little teeth with no problem! Thanks for doing what you guys do best!<//text>

They were so good in this office that I will definitely come here to finish off all the work I need done, and lord knows I have a lot of work to do. Thank you!!!😃< /review>

<text>I brought my daughter here for a teeth cleaning and to check for cavities. We had an appointment and we were not called back until 1.5 hours after our appointment was scheduled, even though we were on time. That alone was enough for me to not come back but then... They brushed her teeth with a toothbrush for her cleaning and did X-rays. They said they couldn't fill her cavities there and we had to go somewhere else (so why do X-rays if you can't even fix anything you find??!) so then we went elsewhere and had to do X-rays again to finally get her work done. Then fast forward six months and I get a bill for the "cleaning" they did because they tried to charge my insurance 6 months after she had gotten the dental work done at another dentist. I don't mind paying my bill, but why the heck would you send it that much later??? Thank goodness we found a dentist who actually cares for my kid, calls us in on time and charges insurance at a reasonable time. Oh and they can actually fill cavities for toddlers too, this place will not.< /text><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

< Review>
As soon as I walked into Dental Express, I was greeted and felt very welcome. The whole time I was here, all I could think about was how kind, and compassionate they are to their patients. Worried about pain? No need to be scared at all when your in the chair here. I was under the care of Dr. Omar, and he is the best dentist I've ever had. While doing my fillings, Dr. kept reminding me to let him know if I started to feel ANY pain. Surprisingly, I didn't feel any pain whatsoever; even during the numbing process! Overall, I'd highly recommend this office to any, and everyone I know, including parents for their children! Thank you Dental Express for changing my outlook on going to the dentist!<//Review>

< Review>
I SAW DR. OMAR. VERY HAPPY WITH HIM. I WILL STAY WITH ONLY SEEING HIM. I GO TO THE CLAIREMONT OFFICE. ALL THE STAFF THERE ARE EXCELLENT. EVERY AREA OF THE OFFICE IS SO CLEAN. ALL STATE OF THE ART EQUIPMENT. I HAVE BEEN HAPPY TO GIVE REFERRALS TO SEVERAL PEOPLE, IN NEED OF A DECENT DENTIST. I WILL ALSO BE BRINGING MY GRANDSON IN THIS WEEK. MOST INSURANCE ACCEPTED, WALK-INS WELCOMED. I HIGHLY RECOMEND DENTAL EXPRESS.

Thank you again, Bobbie.<//Review>

I had a traumatic experience with a dentist as a child; Dr. Chad eased my fear. He explains everything and is patient and gentle. I am in San Diego for a short time and I am glad that his is my dentist while I'm here.< /Text>

Thanks George.... The managers fakeness is the most annoying thing. When asked if my experience was a good one I was honest and let him know I've had issues every single time.

I came here for a regular checkup, not expecting to do any procedures that day. I am very anxious when it comes to dental work, so I made sure to let Dr. Ward know that. I liked that the office was neat and modern, and the appointment scheduling was fast. After taking the X-rays, an assistant gave me a paper to sign saying I understood what procedures are needed, and asked me if I wanted to have my wisdom teeth extracted that day. She was very hasty and couldn't answer my questions clarifying the procedures. I thought it may be good idea to get it over with, but I told the assistant I wanted to first ask the doctor some questions about the procedure to put my mind to rest. I was getting mentally prepared for getting the procedure, waiting to ask the doctor when they can begin, when the assistant entered and started antagonizing me.

While I was waiting for the doctor, the assistants seemed impatient and rushed me to make up my mind about having the procedure. They kept going in and out of the room, asking me if I wanted to extract my wisdom teeth today, which only intensified my anxiety. When I told one of the assistants, Ms. Alicia, that asking me whether I wanted to have the procedure done today only exacerbated my anxiety, she repeated the same question again, with a smirk, "do you want to have the procedure done today?" I was in shock that she would antagonize a patient and I asked to speak to the doctor, which she resisted, asking me what I wanted to ask her.

When Dr. Ward came, I told her what happened - that one of her assistants purposely provoked my anxiety by repeating the very question that I told her increases me anxiety. Dr. Ward said that they were very busy but did not apologize for her assistant's behavior; in other words she defended the assistant. I have never been treated so maliciously by a dental office. I left very distressed by the experience - the, impatience, insensitivity, and outright mockery.</text><gmapID>0x80dc00899582a805:0x183349fe37e8f9bf< /gmapID>< response>

Dr. Galada is a righteous dude, hooked me up with good information, very positive and didn't suggest root canal was the only fix. Got meds to help with pain and infection and got me in to start my work in the same week...all around awesome experience.< /review>

<text>I had a tooth extracted.. in which i screamed out in pain because i was not numb enough yet. the doctor kept pulling causing my tooth to break twice.. and then proceeded to tell me" Your 34 years old no reason you should be sobbing like this"  " does it hurt right now" crying i said yes and  after giving me more numbing medication after i was crying in pain they got the rest of my tooth out.  I am in more pain now then when i went in. I am supposed to go back in 10 days to have my mouth looked at.. i wont be going back.</text>< Pictures>

Worst rental experience ever! I came for a fall out filling and hoping to do a crown. There's an insurance person that negotiated the price with me. After the exam they ask me to come back, the next visit they said that they want to treat my bad tooth ( they said that they found 8!). The insurance guy and the dentists comes and goes, totally confuses me. I asked them what about the crown. They said that you don't have enough money for the crown ( which I came for) and basically forced me to remove the black parts on my teeth.

I also lost my artificial tooth there. They refused to help me find it.<//Text>

Very disappointed. The two grown children running this establishment are doing a very poor job. The entire place had an prominent unclean feeling to it. The food was stale/ not fresh at all. The workers were clearly lazy. No napkins. And to top it off as soon as my boyfriend went to the bathroom (which was also unclean) one of the guys hit on me. Disrespectful.< /review>

<Time>1604175583376< /Time><Review>Not a great experience. We came here the day after Halloween for a free deal they handed out at an event. It took 1 hour to make 6 sandwiches. We had upset toddlers and the staff were very rude ( one teenage girl in particular). I was ready to jump behind the counter and make my sandwich myself. It was like watching the process in slow motion. The food was decent but definitely not worth the time and if I had paid, it would not have been worth the money<//Review></record>

<review>I love how they really pile high and deep the fresh cut meat and cheese. (Keep it comin, this isnt Ethiopia) The vegetables are super fresh and tastey. And they have the option of getting oil and vinegar on the sandwich, which is awesome, not a lot of places do that. All around great sandwiches.</review><Name>Townhouse Captive</Name>< Pictures>

<text>It's not bad, but they are so stingy with the thickness of meat and cheese slices! They are just way too thin, especially for the price. I shouldn't be able to see through that kind of food. The staff is always friendly and I do feel welcomed when I walk in.</text>< pics>

Sandwich selection is very good even though their bread types aren't.  They do catering, have indoor dining and pick up.  I don't know if they offer nitrate free salami or if their bread is yoga mat free.  I just know we love their sandwiches and I hope that the ingredients are good.  :)</Text><Response>None<//Response><time>1470263606390</time><pics>None</pics><user_id>108877349184554067276< /user_id>< rating>

My favorite sub place in town.  They cut your meat for your sandwich right in front of you.  Plenty of choices to choose from.  They now have a rewards card program that helps you earn free sandwiches.  Kelly is a great manager.< /text>

The food is good but the workers are slow. They have not figured out the assembly line method. The cashier sat rigidly at the register and would not even try to help prepare food.<//review>

Dr. Kevin Barry was recommended to me by a friend who has been his patient for over 20 years. On my first visit he spotted what turned out to be a root canal emergency (completely overlooked by previous dentist). He set up an appointment with a root canal specialist 2 blocks away who did the surgery that afternoon. Dr. K. Barry has the latest technology and the expertise/experience to match. He's the best dentist I've ever had, and I'm pretty old (60+). He's a lover of small talk, which puts me at ease during procedures. Always has a smile on his face and is willing to help. I've never seen him have a negative interaction with anyone. His staff will bend over backwards to set you up with a convenient appointment. They are excellent communicators (text, email, etc.)  Covid guidelines are in place. Dr. Barry also knows a network of highly competent dentists of various specialties to recommend for additional work you may need, which is a Plus in any profession! The best...A++ 8 years and still impressed!<//Text>

First of all, they're in the beautiful, Pflueger-designed, easy-to-get-to 450 Sutter building, which makes going in a pleasure in itself.  But the staff and Dr. Barry (Dan) are what makes the place so wonderful.  Unlike many other dental offices, they have always called me in from the lobby the moment my appointment time arrived--no waiting because other patients were late or due to overbooking.  The hygienists are all friendly and thorough.  Dr. Barry does excellent work and is a real card.  The administrative staff are very friendly and know their work; they never seem puzzled or confused or otherwise unable to figure out billing and insurance stuff--like other offices I've been to.  Definitely recommend!< /review>

Dr. Dan Barry is terrific, thorough, checks everything and does it with a smile and a joke. If I need a procedure he explains it in simplified terms, and somehow sneaks in a joke for that too. My hygenist is Patty and she's terrific! I've been going here for over 30 years, and can honestly say I don't dread going to the dentist. :)< /review>

The building that they're in, 450 Sutter St, is a spectacular building and it's super easy to get to. From the moment you walk into the office, the staff is efficient, professional and friendly. I recommend Dr Barry's office without hesitation</Text>

This entire office is truly wonderful. Everyone is super skilled and sensitive to the patients' needs and specific issues. I even had a very difficult time getting to the office last visit (from San Mateo), and I still can't imagine changing to an office closer to me.< /Text>

Been seeing Dr. Kevin Barry for years!  I'm a high maintenance dental patient as I had an accident years ago that left me with a lot of porcelain in my mouth.  Dr. Barry has replaced a lot of it at this point and I have an awesome smile and a healthy mouth!  He is also a lot of fun to chat with.< /Text>

<Name>Armando M< /Name><text>Dr. Daniel D. Barry is very friendly. However, the practice of this place is about getting the most money from your insurance. The receptionist scheduled me for a follow up appointment event though I told her "twice" I was not available that day ( she just insisted and said, I just will l schedule you and if it doesn't work out give us a call to reschedule) I never called and next thing I know they were contacting me to collect a cancellation fee.

I called them and we agreed that the cancellation fee was not valid. The receptionist Mentioned, I had another app coming up which made me mad to know because I never scheduled anything. In fact, I told her that I was not going back, and I was changing from dentist.

They have spam my mail by sending  letters about their worry they have about me leaving with out follow up appointments.< /text><rating>1< /rating><user>106794881782779765226</user>< Response>

<Text>Wonderful experience! The staff was very prompt and clear communicating and setting up appointments.  I had several appointments getting a bunch of work done here.  If I was coming in late I just called in and let them know and everything went smoothly.  Dr. Barry himself is a gentle cheerful person which makes the normally dreaded dentist experience smooth and easy.  He is very experienced and carries out operations with clean durable results quickly and with finesse.  An artist of the dental world!<//Text>< Gmap_id>

<review>I love Dr. Barry, he was born to be a dentist!  I have gone to Dr. Barry for at least 15 years and all his work on my teeth has been A+ quality.  I still have all the fillings and the crown he did for me.  He also has a fun personality and great bedside manner.  He uses tech and will show you cavities so you know he is not doing unnecessary work.  I particularly like that he hums songs to himself while he drills my teeth.  You want a dentist that is relaxed and has a steady hand, so if he can do that, you know he is not nervous about what he is doing.  You can trust Dr. Barry and also his assistant is extremely nice!< /review><Rating>5<//Rating><Gmap_id>0x8085808ea55c18a9:0x91f9879bd006736e</Gmap_id>< Time>

<Review>I'm not a fan of going to the dentist in general, however attending the practice of Dr. Barry has by far has been my best experience. His practice is progressive and very efficient. Appointment setting is easy and efficient, staff are extremely friendly, they have efficient on time appointments and Dr. Barry is always very thoroughly explains his findings. I've had great experience with the dental work I've had performed with him. My wife and I have been going there for 7+ years and  strongly recommend the practice

Kevin continues to be the best dentist that I have ever seen in 50 years of dentistry.
Kevin has been my dentist for at least 10 years and he is without a doubt the best dentist I have ever had.
He is friendly and always remembers things about me.  He is very meticulous in examining my teeth and gums and gently offers advice how how I can improve my own care.
His technicians are nearly all excellent in cleaning my teeth and checking my gums and even deep cleanings are not very painful.
The front office staff is always friendly and helpful and a real treasure.<//Text>< pictures>

<Text>Dr. Kevin Barry is the absolute best! He cares about the whole person and what your mouth might be indicating about your overall health. He explains clearly what procedures he's doing, best practices and has great connections with specialists - for instance when I needed a root canal this past year! You are in great hands with Dr. Barry! And everyone from Corinne to the hygienists are extremely friendly and helpful!<//Text>< Pics>

<Review>Dr. Kevin Barry is an amazing dentist! I have been going to him since 2008. In addition to excelling at dentistry, he is friendly and enthusiastic toward patients. You can't help but be inspired to take better care of your teeth. Dr. Barry is also always up on all the current research. The staff members at the office are wonderful -- knowledgeable, helpful, and friendly. This dental practice provides great service and dental visits are actually pleasant here!</Review><Name>A.D.

< Review>
I always have a wonderful experience when I go to Dr. Barry’s office.  Last time I had a bridge work done, Dr. Barry and his entire staff was so attentive and wonderfully accommodating. I don’t even feel like I was at a dental office. It felt like being among family. I cannot even thing about having another dentist working on my teeth. His attention to details is second to none. I highly recommend Dr. Barry to anyone who needs to have dental work done. He is a brilliant dentist and I say this with every confidence of my being. This team deserves five stars!!!<//Review>

<Review>Kevin has been my dentist for 15 years or more, and I really appreciate his excellent advice, and genuine concern for his patients.  I have never had a bad experience since I have been a patient here, and it is always a pleasure to be greeted so warmly by everyone, and know that they are there to help.  I highly recommend this dental practice, and will continue to do so.  Thank you everyone, I really appreciate the wonderful care.  How many people can say they love going to the dentist?  I can, because I feel it is an extension of family!

Never have I sat with a doctor long enough to feel I was totally cared for 100% - until I met and spoke with Dr. Daniel Barry.  He not only cares about the health of my teeth/mouth etc...but truly cares about me as a person.  Out of respect for him - and more now for myself, I will follow his advice - and push myself forward.   Thank you Dr. Barry.< /Review>

Amazing dentist.  Front office staff is great and Dr Kevin Barry is the best - so personal, so concerned, so professional.  I honestly feel extremely lucky I have him as my dentist.  I've been through a lot of them - some good some bad. Dr Barry is the best. I've been seeing him for about 12 years now. HIGHLY recommended!<//text>

<text>Excellent all around.  Dr. Barry is very attentive, takes all questions seriously, and is concerned about patient all-around well-being.  In fact, he has recommended follow up and referred to a number of physicians on a number of concerns that led directly to their resolution.

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>Been going to Dr. Kevin Barry for years after the recommendation from my best friend, who's entire family goes to him. I actually moved to Los Angeles but still keep my appointments for when I'm back in town for work because this practice is that good! They don't pressure you into any unnecessary teeth whitening products or things that other dentists have tried to do. They're efficient but also friendly and will answer any questions you may have. When I chomped off part of my mouthguard he fixed it for me instead of sending me to the expensive orthodontist. Highly recommend!</Text>< Pics>

Barry has been my dentist for some 20 years,and his office is very conscientious about not only teeth but also gums, which have given me problems in the past. The entire staff is personable and the dental techs are very knowledgeable. Dr. Barry has been on top of every issue with my teeth, and they probably are more healthy now, at my age of 67, than they've ever been. Now I'm 69 and my teeth and gums are doing great. I recently had an implant, and Dr. Kevin R. Barry installed the new crown beautifully.< /Review>< Pictures>

Jacqueline is able to eat and feel confident the veneers will stay on.  Dr.    Kevin Barry is very considerate competent dentist.    Plus he is a very nice person.

<text>The service staff are great but I don’t feel happy with the work the Dr. Daniel Barry did to me. I had two broken teeth and I asked him more than 4 times how much it would cost to fix them. The doctor just made jokes all the time,  he assumed put me resin composite that was the best  for me and he did it while I had my mouth open without asking if I agreed to do that treatment. I was very clear with them about I need to know the prices first to take a desicion because I don’t have dental insurance. They only said don’t worry you are in a good hands. When I asked for the bill. The cost for that was overpriced compared to other dentists.<//text><resp>None</resp><Date>1524850672437< /Date><Name>Viviana Morales</Name>< UserId.>

Dr Daniel Barry and the entire staff are the best ever!   They are extremely professional and friendly.  I never take the time to review my doctors, but this office deserves it!  I started going to them because it was close to my job in the Financial District.  In fact, I don't even work in San Francisco anymore, but I take the time off from work to visit Dr. Barry.  I go to SF just to get my teeth cleaned.  I highly recommend him!< /text>

My husband and I have been going to see Kevin Barry for over 10 years.  He is by far the best dentist we have ever had.  Prior to meeting Dr. Barry, going to the dentist was just about the worst thing I could imagine.  But he is truly a maestro.  He obviously loves his work - it shows.  He is up on the latest treatments and somehow manages to make even the worst procedures painless.  As an added bonus he is extremely friendly. While I won't say that going to the dentist now is a pleasure, it really isn't so bad.<//Text>

< Review>
I've been a Barry patient since the 1980s and my parents went to the elder Barry before that. I had other dentists in the 'burbs when I was a kid, but nothing or no one inspired me to take better care of my teeth than Dan, and I have no urge to change dentists at all. Everybody on staff is terrific - at the desk, the hygienists, the assistants, I've never had a problem with anybody. How many jokes or stories have you heard of people who hate to go to the dentist? Since I've come here, those just don't resonate with me. I look forward to seeing everybody, and I always enjoy receiving the very best of care.</Review>

I have been Daniel Barry's dental client for about 8 years and my teeth have always received wonderful care in his office. Not only is Dr. Barry great, his brother Kevin (partner dentist in the business), the dental assistants, and the staff are really great too. It is overall a good experience.<//text>

I've been going to this office for the last 7 years. They are always kind, courteous, and friendly. Dr. Barry genuinely loves his job and it comes through in how he speaks to his patients. I've moved away from SF, but will drive the hour it takes to get into SF so I can keep Dr. Barry as my dentist. I also just adore the hygienist I see there (Angie). This may sound silly, but her skills at cleaning teeth is literally so relaxing that I nearly fall asleep.< /Text>

<text>I have bruxism (tooth grinding) and Dr Daniel Barry gave me the perfect solution: sleep on your back. That way your neck and jaw relax and it eliminates the problem of grinding. He said when you sleep on your side, your neck is at an angle and this adds stress to it, which can trigger the bruxism. He also suggested a yogic breathing exercise (pranayama), and a couple of other non-druggie suggestions. (If you do yoga, a supported shoulder stand, which Mr Iyengar called the mother of all asanas, is excellent for anxiety and sleep problems.) What other dentist would come up with these kinds of suggestions? I wish I had known about them years ago. I've been doing them and sleep much better, and I am pretty sure that I'm no longer grinding at night.

He did an implant and two crowns for me (both resulting from the horrid bruxism) and did a perfect job. One of the crowns was put in by another dentist who had not done a great job (in fact, I'm pretty sure it was unnecessary, and it only lasted two years) and he did a great job working around the problems the bad dentist had caused. The mouth guard I bought fits perfectly.

The staff are always pleasant, cheerful, and competent.

My friend who recommended the Barrys has been going to them for 27 years. I wish I had known about them 27 years ago!<//text>< pictures>

Dr. Kevin Barry is the best dentist I've ever been to. That's why after over a decade of seeing him, I have not switched to another dentist even though I now live in Oakland. I especially appreciate his interest and engagement in his work. As he was showing me my X-rays, several times he noted something and said, "Isn't that interesting?" And that extended to other physical concerns. Dr. Barry understands how dental health relates to the rest of the body, something most dentists never talk about. I'm so glad to have found him and highly recommend him and the whole office.<//text>

<Review>I have been a patient of Dan Barry for many years. I have always been very satisfied. He and his office are thorough and up to date. I also like the fact that the hygienists do not constantly criticize me for how I brush my teeth.

Dr. Kevin Barry is the ultimate professional who is committed to solving
dental solutions for his patients. Our family is fortunate to be among his patients for 22 plus years. The bonus is a great support staff.</Text>

<review>Dr. Barry is great, he's been my dentist for about 30 years.
He and his staff are very knowledgeable, capable, helpful and make going to the dentist not such a bad experience. They are all fun to see and chat with each time I go for cleaning or work done. I wouldn't go to any other dentist!!!</review>< username>

I have been a patient of Daniel Barry for over 15 years. I have never had a bad experience with them however, my last visit Daniel was out of town and I was seen by a female dentist or assistant whom I've never seen before or worked with. The job got done of course, butI felt it went too fast. She spent majority of my visit on the computer because someone else X-rays were on my file. The regular excellent customer  experience delivered by the office lacked with this person. I hope to see Daniel on my next visit in 3 months.</text>

<review>I recently had a cleaning and thought how pleasant and considerate the staff is and how I would go to lunch with anyone there.  That is generally my gut check in who I like to hang out with. If you value your teeth and your time as much as my wife and I do, you could not do better than visiting the office of Kevin Barry.  Until the Barry brothers  and staff do house-calls, their service could not be better, Scott</review><Name>S Walen</Name></record>

I have been a patient of Dan Barry practically since he started in the business many years ago. 25 years +. Couldn't ask for a better dentist. Great on the technical side, and a great personality to boot. He will be my dentist until one of us kicks the bucket!< /Text>

The entire office gets 5 stars. From Corrine and Whitney up front, to the hygienists, to Che to Dr. Kevin Barry, they make an otherwise dreaded event into a painless and valued experience.  I would recommend them highly to anyone in need of dental work!< /Text>

<review>Dr Kevin Barry has been my dentist ever since I moved to San Francisco over 17 years ago.  I couldn't be happier with a dental practice: I know I'm in excellent hands, and the staff are courteous, friendly, and professional, and the place is spotless.   I'd be hard-pressed to find something they could improve on.</review>< pictures>

<text>Daniel fixed my decayed front teeth in 1985 with a new procedure.  Once done he called his father in and said "see dad, that's how it looks".  I'll never forget it. I was a student @ UC Berkeley and he only charged me $100 and it is still holding and looks natural and great.
THANK YOU DR. BARRY.
Fantastic, awesome, great, cool, nice, friendly, pleasant and smiling.</text>< username>

My husband and I have been coming to Dr. Barry for so long more than 20 years. Even my son who lives in Taiwan, always comes back to see Dr. Barry for check ups and dental cleaning , the office staff always take good care of us for our appointments , time usually  so flexible to us. We are driving to the city  for the appointments usually takes hours, but we loves him so much we don't mind  at all.<//Text>

Been coming to this office for years; can't imagine going anywhere else. Everybody who works here is relentlessly cheerful and helpful. The office is scrupulously clean and everyone does their job in a truly stellar way. I feel so well taken care of and know my teeth are in the very best of hands. It's a little pricey, but what dentist isn't??? Thanks, Dr. Kevin and staff!! Keep it up.
Latest here, as of August 2020. This office is doing everything in its power to keep everybody safe. Strict protocols are in place; I was quite comfortable and well cared-for. It's nice to get my teeth cleaned completely worry-free. These guys are awesome!< /Text>

I've been a patient of Dr. Kevin Barry's since the mid 1990's. In that time, I've spanned the gamut of dental work -- crowns, root canals, fillings, etc. I completely trust Dr. Barry. He's done incredible work over the years, and he's given me excellent referrals over the years to orthodontists and endodontists.  He is gracious, kind, and he's even good at drawing to help explain things. I go to a periodental hygienist and she has remarked on how beautiful the crowns are that Dr. Barry has made for me. The office staff and dental assistants are wonderful and the location is very convenient -- a quick walk from BART or muni. I highly recommend Dr. Kevin Barry.<//Review>

I went to Kevin's father long before Kevin, and am glad to see his sons continue the practice.

You are in good, caring hands with this dental group</text>

Dan Barry has been my dentist for over twenty years. After having had some mediocre dentists prior to him, it's been a real pleasure having a dentist who I now trust to do an excellent job...so I stuck with him!</Review>

< review>
We purchased our travel trailer from Major RV. Steve was our salesman he was awesome. He took the time to go over everything with us. I will defiantly send all my friends and family here. They have the best prices in town. The finance department was great too. Major RV went above and beyond our expectations.  GREAT SERVICE ALL THE WAY AROUND!!!<//review>

<Review>I was hesitant to buy our family’s new Toyhauler,  a Genesis Vortex 1915LE at our local RV dealership.  Jeremy was very helpful in showing us a couple of units and and let me take measurements of the cargo area so that I can fit a 4 seat side by side (2021 RZR XP 4 Turbo).  It was a a very positive experience and my wife and I we were very pleased with both the sale and service departments as they also sold and installed a brake controller and anti-sway hitch on our tow vehicle on site.  Great job to all.  Update:  I had an issue with my AC unit Steve and Adam (Service Dept) resolved the issue very quickly.</Review>< Pictures>

We have been looking at travel trailers for months. We had never been to Major RV, but we saw online they had one of the trailers we were considering in stock. We went in and looked, bought it same day. Our sales memeber was Gerson and he made the entire process effortless. We had such an amazing experience that it just felt right, meant to be! We have already started sending our friends and family there. We got the best of the best in all areas. FIVE STARS!!<//Review>

We purchased a new Genesis Supreme Vortex 3219VXL and received excellent customer service. We initially had another toy hauler in mind but Brandon took the time to discuss our wants/needs and then allowed us the time to take everything in to consideration and make a decision. He gave a very thorough walk through leaving no stone unturned.
I'd also like to mention that the guys who helped prep the trailer were also very helpful. I asked them for their impressions of each trailer and their information was invaluable in helping us make a decision.
I had my fifth wheel hitch installed while they prepped the trailer and I was literally beach camping the next day.
I highly recommend Major RV. It's worth the small amount of time to head up the hill from the "big box" dealers.<//review>

We purchased a Rockwood Ultra Lite 2608BS in late December 2020.  We couldn't be more pleased with the purchase, the courteous and straightforward treatment during the sales process, and the knowledgeable service during our final walkthrough.  This is our 4th RV purchase, and by far, the best.  Thank you to everyone at Major RV!<//text>

< review>
The staff at Major RV are top notch and exceptional. They were upfront with the Toy hauler we bought and didn’t try to sell us anything we didn’t need. Our overall experience was comfortable and there was never any pressure to something we didn’t want to do. Jeremy was excellent with keeping us updated on the planned arrival of our Forest River Sandstorm 242slc and stayed with us until the final signature. Ron was super friendly and helpful with showing us the features of the trailer and doing the initial paperwork. Ask him about his 3 year old Labrador 😊 Kenny was outstanding with getting us set up with all the necessary items we’ll need once we start camping and was a pleasure to work with. Melissa was very personable and down to earth while doing the financial part of everything. She really cares and wants to see their customers happy and be able to get what they want, and at a great rate!!! We’d give Major RV 6 Stars or whatever the maximum amount of stars can be given. We went to them of a family referral and we’ve already referred all our friends and family that are looking to buy toy haulers or travel trailers.<//review>

Tony took a lot of time to explain in detail how the travel trailers worked and what I needed and why, as a newcomer to RV/travel trailers this was very important to me. Melissa was one of the best process' I ever worked with and helped us through the paperwork process with great ease while explaining everything. I highly recommend Major RV, even if you are in Orange County like we where, it really did not take that long to get to Hesperia and the RV lot is super easy to find and is very close to a major food/shopping mall.</text>

We decided to stop by to check out the RV after going to others RV dealers in the high desert which no one bother to help us.  Jeremy approached  to us and helped us tremendously when asking questions  about the RV... we were very satisfied how we were treated and we drove off with a new RV.... Definitely  recommend to stop by and check them out... they definitely have the best price....<//Review>

I had a great time today purchasing a camper at Major RV in Hisperia. The whole staff were wonderful with excellent people skills. Their knowledge on the travel trailer I purchased was above my expectations and “Ron” answered just about every question I had concerning my travel trailer. More importantly, if he didn’t have an answer, he immediately asked one of his coworkers who was more than happy to answer the question. This is my first travel trailer and believe me when I say this. The staff at Major RV made me feel right at home! They have the best prices in town and mechanics on hand if you need them. Thanks Major RV, and you guys will be seeing me again!< /Text>

I live in rhe HD and have until recently used Giant RV in Colton to service my travel trailer. Today, I went to Major RV in Hesperia to get a vent cover for my refrigerator that fell off during a recent trip. I spoke to Kenny in sales and his service was outstanding! The one he had was made of a different material than mine and he agreed to check for my original cover, verified that it would fit and found it at another So Cal RV parts distributor. Although I initially disagreed that his vent cover would fit my trailer, he assured me it would and then showed me by measuring the vent opening on a trailer siimilar to mine that he had on his lot.

Based on my contact with Kenny and the awesome customer service he provided me, I will NEVER waste my time at Giant RV again.

Thanks again Kenny!

They are a subsidiary of Rami Auto dealer 22720 Grand River, Detroit, MI 48219. Rami Auto Dealer took my money ($4740.00) for a truck and never delivered it.  Be very careful. They scammed me.< /Review>

Absolutely the best trailer purchasing experience ever!  They were the lowest price, so we figured they’d try to make their money somewhere else in our deal.  Instead, they gave us more money for our trade than we thought we’d get!!  They delivered on everything they promised, and more.  Don’t go anywhere else!!<//review>

< Review>
My experience here was more than pleasant. From the moment I walked onto the lot the sales associates were helpful but not pushy. They happily answered any question I had. When I picked up my travel trailer they gave me a walkthrough and “class” on all the features and how to use everything. I would recommend to anyone!</Review>

After looking up used RV’s online to deciding to purchase a new one. We decided to visit a different local RV lot to take a closer look. But my excitement faded while dealing with old school pushy salesman tactics, which led me to began to second guess our decision owning a new RV.

We left that lot and decided to check out one more local spot before heading out of town for a better experience. We headed over to Major RV Sales off of Main Street in Hesperia.

I AM SO GLAD WE DID!!!
We didn’t realize that the lot was already closing up but some how we managed to peak around. Jeremy is in the middle of his closing duties when he went out of his way to kindly show us around the lot never making us feel bad that he was helping us after hours. He was great, he was direct, honest and no bs! No salesman tactics, just straight to the point.
We fell in love with the simplicity of a certain RV and after showing us many more beautiful ones, we decided to go back to “the simple one” . Thank you Jeremy.

Next day we had our “walk through” with Brandon to show us how to use our new home on wheels. He was great too! So patient, and thorough while he went over every little detail in and out of the RV. Even offering major pointers on the “Do’s and Don’t’s” when using our new 2020 RV. Thank you Brandon!

Now to finish our paperwork. Melissa was awesome and quick and super sweet. Even offered us ways to stay at certain camp grounds for free to test out our newbie RV camping skills. During this process she realized who we are and shared stories about visiting our local restaurant. Thank you for the support Melissa!
Towards the end of our purchase we were referred us to Steve, their friendly installer. He quickly changed out the TV and sound bar for us and assured us that we could bring it back to install future upgrades and he would assist us. He even offered us some of his camping tips too. Thank you Steve!

Bottom line here guys, they are all great. I would drive many miles for this experience.
We love our RV and can’t wait to visit with our new friends at our family restaurant to tell them all about our new adventures! 🙌 🙌<//Text>

Before doing business with Major RV, I visited 2 other RV dealers in the Inland Empire. My experience with Tony and Jeremy was very pleasant. The price was also better than the price I was quoted at the 2 other dealerships that I visited before. When afterwards I had a minor issue with the toy hauler I bought, they were very quick to help me. I am very satisfied and I highly recommend them if you are looking for an honest RV dealership to buy your RV.< /text>

Michelle and Brandon jumped through hoops after we changed our mind as we were there taking delivery to our new trailer. They worked it out and still got us out on time for our trip. We highly recommend the drive to Hesperia to get a new trailer from Major RV. Not that we plan on getting another trailer anytime soon, but when or if the time comes we will be heading back up the hill for a visit with them first. We went with the 2020 Sandstorm 336 GSLR 5th wheel toy hauler.< /text>< pics>

< Review>
Idahoans go south, after looking and dealing with the dealers in my area of twin falls, I started looking to out of state dealers for the certain model I was looking for. There was only 1 model in the 3 states around me, and I was quoted a price that knocked me off my chair, especially after seeing that these guys had 3 in stock with a sales tag of $10000.00 cheaper. I was hesitant to call but glad I did. Of course its hard to trust a salesperson, but talking to them for awhile, I just got a good feeling about them. After a few more phone calls and questions I gave them a deposit to hold until we got down there and touch it. After arrival the trailer was exactly what they stated and most important the deal was exactly what they stated. Not to mention these guys are just good down to earth people, when we left to go home with trailer we felt like we made new friends. Don't hesitate, I almost did because of distance and not knowing these guys, but very glad I did.< /Review>

<Text>So this review is long overdue, was in the market and a buddy told me to check this place out which was the way to go. The people here are very knowledgeable and helpful and the best part is they don't push you to buy and they don't try to drain your pockets, I got the best price for a brand new Rockwood. Awesome travel trailer. If your in the market don't waste your time anywhere else in the desert, just go here. You won't regret it that's for sure. Thanks again, and special thanks to Jeremy. Keep up the great work.<//Text><gmap_id>0x80c3680ab16c5b6d:0xdaad698fe7054465</gmap_id><user_id>105944213787420742301<//user_id></record>

Excellent customer service. Other dealers were telling me that with my credit, I would be paying 15% or more for financing. Major RV (Jeremy) got me a loan at 7.74%. Highly recommended!</text>

Best price for my Salem Cruise Lite, T281QBXL travel trailer. 2015. Great service from sales people. Financial Dept know there stuff and are really helpful.
The owner is friendly, helpful. Sales people didn't seem pushy, more like a friend trying to sell you something rather then a stranger. Friendly environment. Not the biggest lot, but worth a stop if your in the market. You will find it very competitive with certain models.</text>

Major RV is the best dealer anywhere.  I am from Orange County and no one can beat their price or they quality of service .  I read a review from Mr.Tapia who claims they are racist because they would not give him a $500 discount.  Well Mr Tapia 650 is not a top credit score so take your business else where and Major will continue to serve people that deserve courtesy and honesty.</text>

By Far the best RV dealership in southern California and surrounding areas.
The drive is defiantly worth it, no Pushy sales people, unbeatable prices,  and awesome staff. Great sales people with knowledge, awesome warranty lady, a very knowledgeable service manager, awesome and helpful parts manager,  great finance manager that gets deals done. With employees like this there must be something right going on here.</Text>

Awesome experience, I waited a while before giving a review because some places will be great to you until you buy it then ignore you, but not this place. Any question I've had or concern has been answered quickly. Brandon was my sales man and he took care of me found many ways to save me money on my 2016  sandstorm toy hauler and has been great since, even giving me his cell number in case I had a problem after hours, I would highly recommend major rv to my friends and family.</Text>

Great place to buy an RV. They are smaller but they can give you the personal attention the big dealers  can't....and without the high pressure sleaziness oozing from the big boys down the hill. I had been looking for a Rockwood Mini-Lite 2506s and stumbled upon Major RV in my search. Erick and Jeremy were both great to work with both before and during the sale and gave me a thorough PDI walk through on my unit. Finance guy was super nice too. Good prices and friendly staff and they had the rig I had been searching for - I would definitely buy from here again.</text>

< review>
My wife and I were looking for a Toy Hauler and did plenty of research as this was our first trailer. We dealt with a couple of other dealerships prior to going to Major. We were specific with our price point and what we wanted. We were told they could work on the price. After driving for hours, we found out this wasn't the case. In addition to no flexibility, the wanted to charge thousands of dollars for "PDI" and heavily "marked up" the price for the battery as well as the sway bar/weight distribution system. After almost giving up, I contacted Major through email. I was answered promptly by Jeremy. He advised that the price listed was the lowest they could do. This was refreshing, as I knew the price going into it and didn't stress about having to "haggle." He gave a full breakdown of out the door pricing, in writing.  After looking at the price quote and comparing to other dealerships, I found their price to be better than anywhere else I looked. The only issue I ran into was after driving an hour and a half on a Sunday to look at the trailer, Jeremy told me their financing was closed and we would have to wait till Monday. He called back on Monday and advised us the financing went through and we could pick it up. We went on a Friday, which was Jeremy's day off, and met with Brandon who did the walk through. He was very thorough and provided helpful tips. While doing the walk through, Jeremy showed up to congratulate us and make sure everything was in order. April made the paperwork process a breeze and we were out the door. Overall I am very happy with the service provided. The staff was very helpful and I never felt pressured into buying. They didn't "hover" over us as we were looking around, but were available for assistance when needed. I would definitely refer them to anyone wanting to buy a RV.<//review>

Definitely a racist dealership. I got blown off. And finally when I approach them with a $10k down payment and 650 credit. They still refused to go down 500$. What a shame. NOTICE ALL THE NAMES THAT HAD ARE 5 stars. Most of them don’t have a Spanish last name. 👎🏼 Sorry I’ll take my business elsewhere you should too.<//review>

THE SLEAZIEST RV DEALER ON THE PLANET

SUPER NASTY
SUPER SHADY
SUPER SLEAZY

I went here to buy an RV and the salesman tried to intimidate, disrespect and talk down to me. He stooped so low that he tried to mock me because I had skin cancer on my face.

If you treat others like a scumbag, it means you are a scumbag. They’re scumbags.

AVOID AT ALL COSTS ! ! !< /Review>

<text>I was looking for a new Toyjauler for my family & I found the one I wanted online in Hesperia. I dealt with Tony the owner on the phone so I made the 5 hour drive to pick it up. It was worth the drive to save a couple of thousand dollars. I would recommend this helpful & honest dealer to everyone I know.< /text><pics>None<//pics></record></dataset><record>

We were thrilled with the RVS and the prices at Major RV and the people were very nice when selling us our trailer.  unfortunately, I cannot say the same for the service after the trailer was bought.  Service does not keep you informed, does not return phone calls etc.  A brand new trailer and our kitchen sink fell out, fell out!!!  Think they might prioratize that for a customer?  If you buy here, go somewhere else for service!<//text>

<Text>Smaller lot but quality trailers there. If you know what you want and don’t want to be hassled by sales people (like me) this place was great. Very helpful but they would left us alone and let us ask the questions we wanted answered and they didn’t try to push us either way. Had recent experiences with the bigger volume dealers in the Inland empire and this place was better in all facets. If you like to haggle and make crazy demands to get a better deal, this is not your place. They are similar to Carmax in the sense that the prices they have listed are fair and there’s no back and forth on prices. I live in Rancho Cucamonga and the drive to Hesperia was totally worth driving on the 15 freeway. Highly recommended!< /Text></record>

<text>My wife and I recently purchased a 2017 29' Forest River Salem Cruise Lite.
Our experience at Major RV was beyond easy.  Eric was our salesperson. He was patient and answered all our questions to our satisfaction.  There was absolutely no pressure.  The no haggle price was still cheaper than other dealers and they don't charge a pre-delivery inspection fee.  There was no hidden fees added either.  Jeremy and Eric made sure we didn't buy more trailer than our tow vehicle can handle.  It's no secret that some dealers will sell you a 10,000 LB trailer and tell you your Fiat will tow it fine.  We used our own financing but Melissa in the finance department was very nice and tried her best to beat our pre-qualified rate.  The pre-delivery inspection was thorough and easy.  Final paperwork was a breeze. They even delivered the trailer to our home because we hadn't gotten around to installing our hitch (we live local).   We will definitely be back when it's time to upgrade.
Be sure and ask for Eric.</text><Gmap_id>0x80c3680ab16c5b6d:0xdaad698fe7054465< /Gmap_id>< username>

<Text>Bought a new 2014 Salem Cruise Lite travel trailer.  Anthony was my sales person and was patient with me throughout the entirety of the sale.  Their prices were the lowest around so they didn't really negotiate on price (just a couple hundred) and I scoured the trailer before taking delivery and found a few minor issues which they addressed immediately.  I mean, I really checked everything using a checklist I found online.  He didn't rush me during the PDI and walked me through the trailer showing me how everything works, which is standard practice, but was nice anyway.  They also set up my weight distribution equipment on the trailer while I was inspecting the trailer.  I passed on their aftermarket warranty and recommend instead getting the 2nd year warranty direct from Forest River for $150 (or $250 depending on model).

I did end up having an issue with the floor during the first outing and the service department was spot on coordinating the repair with Forest River in Rialto and I got my trailer back in no time.  I was upset that the linoleum floor needed to be replaced, but that wasn't the dealer's fault and they were great with the warranty coverage.  The lesson here is to check the floor with your BARE FEET, not just shoes. ;)

It's a small RV dealer and overall a first class operation, I recommend.<//Text><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

I stopped by Major RV after getting their address from the Dometic web site for Certified Dometic Service Dealers for a problem I was having with my RV unit. They were polite on the phone, came right out and the service guy Pete was nice and seemed like he know what he was talking about. I told him my A/C was not blowing alot of air. He went up took the cover off and then came down and told me that my unit was not a 15,000 BTU but 13,500 and thats what my problem was. HE never turned on my A/C at all to see the problem with the air flow. Then he said he would call domitic and see what can be done because he didnt install the unit. NO calls back I went there 4 times and called 3 all that was said there is nothing that they can do. Well I called Dometic TWICE in one day gave them my Model  and Serial number and it is a 15,000 btu after all. I dont know if they need more training on how to call Dometic and verify Model numbers but for me to have to tell them what I have Is a complete break down of company training. I hope they learned from this because my back was against the wall and I trusted them to  be more knowledgeable on Dometic A/C units. As far as not returning my phone calls I dont know but AL the service manager  or Pete the tech need to do a better job. I didn't get bad service from them just poor customer service and poor knowledge of Dometic A/C units.</review>

<username>Maritza Espinoza</username><Rate>1< /Rate><Text>Terrible customer service by Alex I went in there for a plan info on the 4/100 plan deal and told me I couldn’t change my plan to have 5g because my phones were to old when the four people I was going to add have an Iphone 11 pro it’s the newest Iphone and I knew he was lying because my relatives have that same plan with old androids and iphone 7’s and they have 5g data. This guy just wants to sell and get money definitely don’t buy from him nor let him fool you. I decided to change my plan through their online customer service and now have 5g for my four lines without having to purchase new phones. Worst customer service here!!!</Text></record>

They really playing costumers... the phone I wanted turned out to have a much higher  price at the register than displayed, and the employee said it was because paying in full cash was more expensive than paying in installments..?? Turned out the phone I was about to buy isn’t the one I picked out. Not coming here again anytime soon< /text>

I like this place. David helped me. He answered all my questions and concerns without being condescending. I had been at two other T-Mobile's today and  the service was really not as good. So my advice is to ask for DAVID‼️😀</Review>

<review>I have to agree that even the so-called "managers" are rude. She rolled her eyes at me! That is beyond unprofessional. I can't wait for the day when these workers are replaced by a simple kiosk that can do their job 100 times better than they can.</review>< gmap_id>

<Text>Worst experience ever, came to buy a new device because i had purchased a sim card in a diferrent store. And they were lying about everything you to get a purchase, we tried to get some other information and the kid was not helpul at all,and had no idea what he was talking about.
This is a main store and not a franchise.
Way better a franchise store on whittier and garfield.</Text>< Rating>

Came in to get in on the bogo galaxy promotion. We needed to open a new line so we opened one for a family member. That family member had unlimited calling to mexico and wanted to keep that. We asked if that was the case and they assured us it was. Well they LIED and now we have to add it at an extra cost.< /Text>< gmapID>

Horrible customer service. Came in for help with a defective battery on my phone so they did a warranty exchange on my note 4 and I asked if I was going to get a new battery the rep said yes. The day it came in it was a refurbished phone with no battery and a messed up speaker that buzzes when the volume is higher than the half way point. Now they're telling me they can give me another refurbished phone. Still won't give me a battery or I have to go through Samsung<//Text>

HORRIBLE customer service. I went in there a couple of days prior and bought a new phone with a new line. I came in today and the manager Crystal helped me because I had questions about the lines and rudely told me we can't help you. I needed to call T-Mobile. I came in for customer service and instead I got attitude. Never again.< /text>

<rate>1< /rate><review>Worst Customer Service I have ever got in my life! The assistance Manager has a attitude I had a problem and while talking to her she answered a call and she was talking about how some guy was bringing her Starbucks very unprofessional . Then I go in to purchase a Tablet and the guy who sold it to us , said nothing was going to change on my account and completely lied to us . I Ended having a bill of 500$ . I have been with t-mobile for more than a year and My bill has never been more than 180 this guy made my bill go to 500 without telling us why. Never stepping into that store again and if I do I'm recording them from now on. BRING IT.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

I don't like this store at all
Extremely poor customer service, the manager said to me ( is this all you need ? So I can get back to what I was doing )
Also the sales rep Patty did  not do her part in the paperwork for my early termination fee.
when I switched over from verizen.
I never received the 300.69 dollars in which I had to pay from my own pockets.
The assistance manager is tipickle la lat with a tipecal teen attitude bubblegum chewing at that also
Tmoble where is my early termination fee my
300.69 dollars it's Ben a year now, and after arguments and more arguments over the phone.maybe I'll call channel seven ant let people know what's going on.
Let's turn this location into a Starbucks store< /Review>

<Text>Horrible tmobil store the guy working there is a very unprofessional. I was trying to buy an iphone 6s and he qouted me 360... At first so i drop the 360 and he then type in a few more things and then bumped up the price to $512. I questioned him asking why did it just go from 360 too 512 and his response was mute.  Not wanting to put up with this i left the store with money in hand. A couple days later i had traveled to the store in carson off avalon n the 405 freeway. I got qouted $318 but unfortunately they only had the color pink. No bueno tmobil.</Text>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) Online waiting more than an hour. The staff showed no interest in providing good service. It was practically getting rid of the client so he could close up and leave. Personally lousy service.

<text>Okay once again they overcharged me, once I got home I noticed they charge me for two bags of Fritos and I only pray for items. The store is in disarray, unorganised with products on the floor and on various shelves oh, just a mess. I do have to say the cashier was very nice although she's over charged me twice in the past this being the third time. I don't go back to claim a refund because they will just accuse me of lying which was my previous experience.</text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

Make sure you want or need what you buy. Returns are only given in store credit and only $10 credit per return. The pros are convenience and cheap prices.<//Review>

The items are always priced wrong. It's very frustrating when you are picking up items labeled $2 and $3 and then they ring them up as 6 and $7</text>

Good range of products when stocked. lately they have had issues in that area. It's clean and organized.
The staff could use some training, the conversations heard between them is sometimes inappropriate.
Huge lack of shopping carts but still well worth a visit.</Review>

If the rating of this store was based on mean and nasty individuals Janet would easily rate 5 stars. She said her name was Janet/ one of the managers she was not wearing a name tag. Her name could have beeen Karen as she is easily the most spot on example of a Karen 2020 has spit out. I made the mistake of giving her my passport when she asked for ID, rather than just nicely asking for another form of identification she unleashed a truly impressive torrent of villainous attitude that left me feeling an inch tall "which was obviously the point". I immediately handed over her prefered form of ID but that did not appease her nastiness. I then made the mistake in indulging my curiosity and asking why U.S passports were not valid. " I know, Curiosity killed the cat, I shouldn't have asked" Keren/Janet thought I shouldn't have asked either, her voice took on a shrill pitch that was actually a bit terrifying. I wished her a nice day hopeing to appease her generally aggressive and mean hearted attitude but she spit some more acid my way. If you go to this store keep your head down or they might rip it off.<//text>

This store only has 3 carts so shopping isn’t easy!
Then at check out the cashier put bread in with board games and smashed it, he didn’t hand us our bags that were NOT easy to get to seeing as how you have squeeze between the register and a display they have then reach around and grab your bags. Then he says here! Hands me my recipe rudely! He was either having a bad day or just doesn’t care at all.</review>

They really play that convenience card on ya.  Over priced and items on the shelf say one price but when you get up to the register it's another price you feel rushed to get out of there so it's hard to bring up your concerns about items being mis priced.<//review>

I love the name.. I love when they have major sales on their clothes, but most of the time they never have their shelves stocked , they are always out of everything...
Their prices are not all that cheap either...
But if you need to grab a few things they are okay, that is if they have it in stock 😉<//Text>

<Text>Great store with descent prices. Easy in and out. Friendly, helpful clerks.
Added note:
I previously gave this store a, less than favorable review based on one visit. Never mind the many other easy, quick stop ins.  I'm a frustrated old man, and have to realize that this is a small town with a small job pool. Everyone wants a paycheck, but have no clue as to work ethic.. so, once in awhile there's a hitch in the giddy up.. and you have to adjust.. Not whine.
These are good folks. And get an "A".< /Text><response>None</response>< Name>

There is a line at the store to check out. It is not marked. Make sure to get in it. When I accidentally cut the  line the other patrons were visibly and audibly upset. The headphones ($5.50) were adequate for the flight home. Employees were very nice.<//Review>

Love it
Almost always a long line, but the true pleasantness of the employees and most of the customers makes up for any time you spend thinking you could be doing something else.
Maybe instead of checking your watch you could check in with your neighbor. I'll bet they're pretty interesting - probably more interesting than your watch anyway<//Text>

A great place for deals once you learn which items are the real values.
The staff is friendly and helpful and will after a few times remember you and make you feel like a valued consumer.
Like the old corner store mentality in a large venue.</Text>

Very good variety at great prices.  Definitely worth browsing this store.  Appears to have something for everyone.  Some unexpected items that I was thrilled to find.  I highly recommend this store.<//text>

Disorganized and mostly overpriced product making the dollar store really a store that offers two isles of items only a dollar and everything else way too expensive. (They do have good prices on beer and liquor though. )<//Text>

<Review>Busy store more so than others, love the dollar aisle always out of the good stuff though if you don't go in the morning. Staff is so so friendly but they take EBT all the credit cards chip in cash and you can't beat the prices on just about everything Cheep, it is cheap.</Review></record></dataset><record>

STORE HOURS 8AM-11PM Google has the open times as 7am-10pm.

This place has ok items.

1. There's always a line. Especially since save-a-lot closed.

2. Customer Service is ok. But they don't seem to keep people very long.

3. The lot & the store needs to be picked up regularly. I had to walk out to the parking lot to get a shopping cart.

If you hit the sweet spot & the store isn't too busy it's ok. And hopefully it doesn't look third world in & out of the store.

I raised my score to 3 stars 8.19.17<//Text>

You can't go wrong here, especially if you're on a budget.... Some things u can get away with but the old saying, "u get what u pay for" it's common sense. No problems with the service.<//Review>

< Review>
The reason I put 2 stars is, the last couple of times I have been here, it looks as though they are closing for good... the shelves are bare, the items that are on sale... gone. Not just 1 time, several times during the sale I have went and, Nothing. .. its like, they sucker u in for the sales and never intend on having that item. I really liked this place, but something is going on.< /Review>

<Rating>4</Rating><text>I love shopping at dollar general because of the super low prices but this last time was not ok!
There was a super long line with only one cashier open.
Up front there was 3 employees
One was ringing ppl out, the other 2 were throwing the watermelons in the front away!
I understand a clear store is always best to shop at but do it at a slow time, or at closing time, not when there is a huge line!
Other than that, I love going there!!
My all time, go to, last min store!!!
Oh btw cleaning supplies are the cheapest I’ve found so far!
Dollar general brand toilet paper 32 pk is only $10.+ and it’s great, leaves no crumbles 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤭<//text></record>

I guess since this place is called Dollar General and it's a discount store they think service has to be below service standards. The store was dirty, low in  stock, idles clutter either with boxes or items on the floor. Service was very very poor. The book section was a total mess and only 2 cashiers. One cashier having 11 customers in line and 9 with the other cashier. I asked one of the cashiers were I could find a product and was rudely answered "I don't know you just have to go thru the canned food idles and look for it". Bad attitude, dirty store, low in stock definitely will not be going back to this store.</text>

Usually a quick easy stop when you're watching those pennies which can be twice as much at Stater's, like a bag of ice!</review>

The customer service is non existent. Bathroom was out of order, at least that is what they said. I went in with my two older teen daughters, we ended up with a basket full of items. They did not greet us when we walked up to the register or thank us after spending $50. It's not a bad place to shop but I don't go back to places that act like they are doing you a favor because you are inconveniencing them by being there. Needless to say, we will NOT be going back.< /Text>

I didn't really dislike the place is just that there is one case she ran a lot of people in line they should have had the other line open in the shelves look like they were empty maybe they were stalking but I am not judging it I'm not saying it I disliked it I will go again</Review>

I used to go shopping there but one time they had these tags out saying that prices have been slashed so these cards said if something's for a dollar you get it for $0.50 and so on so forth I put a lot of things in my basket when I got to the register they would not honor the discounts and they tried to charge me full price and when I questioned it they got belligerent was yelling at me telling me to leave the store and never come back that I won't be allowed in and all kinds of stuff I was very disrespected I could not believe the unprofessionalism of that store I think it's totally ghetto and I will not go back to that store I give my money to other stores</Review>

<text>Went there for $5 carpet remnants n must return for a $5 scented candle that works for 6 months on top of a warmer plate. Great deals on odds n ends. I bought a sprinkler here for $5 years ago.

Things were in spots with one price but when you get to the register it's a higher price. I'm on a budget so when I have to put things back because I don't have enough money not only is it embarrassing it makes me not want to shop there</Text>

Ok good evening everyone i had to update my review...
Well first off thet need a button to remove a item instead of deleting everything and starting over. One holdong up a line and seriously they change staff so much its a joke. Sencond u dont make your customers bag up there own stuff even when there disabled. The guy was nice at first but dam dont talk smack about your customers either. The guy with the blond hair up to his shoulders when u scan items put in customer bags i mean i didnt want one item omg it was nerve wrecking also they need to stalk the shelves properly. Seems like u can never find anything u want cuz its on top shelf where bo one can reach. All i have to say i think i go some where else were i can find things and dont have to bag my stuff and were they have a back or delete button that was a joke in itself.</text>

Prices set on the stand do not match at checkout. Nor sale  items. When asked they have no idea of what is being said, instead of checking and making it right.<//Review>

<text>Most of the employees are very nice but see a lot of standing around not paying attention to the long lines and one register open. New manager bragged a lot about cleaning up the store and making sure more registers are open. Store still dirty and really smells. Friend had a interview and manager was a no show.</text>< Pics>

<review>this store needs help with learning how to respect the people who go in. it seems like the floors are always dirty, crowded I don't even go anymore staff very disrespectful. id rather spend an extra 2 or 3 dollars just so I don't have to deal with rude employees.</review>< Pics>

< Review>
This Store is the MOST DISHEVELED, I have EVER Seen.  Boxes, in Almost EVERY Isle. Unorganized, Just a Filthy Mess! BIG Turnover, w/Employees! The Store is Overloaded w/items to be Stocked, Instead, NOT ONCE have We Ever Gone Inside, & saw the Store Organized, NOT ONCE. BAD MANAGEMENT. We have been to Other DG, & SPOTLESS!! AGAIN, BAD MANAGEMENT....ugh!!!</Review>

One of my favorite stores out here in DHS. It is such a shame that the poor cashiers do not seem to have enough support. The lines are always too long and even when they have 2 at the register, it isn't enough. Too many customers for such a lack of employees. That's the only down side there.<//Review>

The store is never stocked. There is always a line of 5 to 6 people and 1 checker. Employees are less then willing to assist customers with product.  Clothes are shoved on racks hard to get to. Mgrs change weekly and have worst attitude. District Mgr tried but failed. Corporate obviously careless if customers are treated with respect, timely fashion, knowledgeable staff and friendly cuz this store lacks all of this.<//text>

Always messy and alleys blocked with stuff. The prices are really not that good but still cheaper than other places around the area. Saturdays are the worse to go here.< /review>

< Review>
Horrible. All employees are running around the store doing  nothing while 1 cashier is tending a line of 15 customers. This is how its always been here it seems. I've never seen 2 cashiers running customers until I raised my voice and said something. Disrespectful employees. Garbage products disgusting facility all around. Avoid at all cost</Review>

I don't think that there's another place where you can find good food at the prices that they give and I don't think that there's any place else in the desert that would employ people on the last leg that are trying God is there he doesn't care Jesus doesn't care he wants you to come to him and ask for food ask for a blanket ask for love Dollar General has my dollars I'm coming back real soon  and all you rich people out there millionaires the dip your apples and gold and save them till your deathbed so you can devour them you should see these people living to go to the Dollar General and spend  some money help support your brothers and sisters in need without money they can't buy more goods to basically give to the needy without really giving it to them something given has no value these people know that they earned it<//text>< pictures>

<Text>Went to store because their website said that it opened at 7 am I got there at 7:53 and a really rude told me in a very rude manner that the store doesn't open till 8 I said it was ok I could wait till 8am. I waited patiently outside and manager knowing that customer is outside doesn't open door on time to at least try to be courteous to their customers< /Text>< userid>

<Review>Employees there seem to be in a time continuum.  They really don't care to help or hurry for you, unless it's closing time of coarse.  Cashiers can be a bit rude at times... in need of some serious leadership!< /Review>< resp>
