POV is very responsive and professional, and they offer a very wide variety of media on which to print (we chose aluminum - brilliant!).  Though their website makes it very easy to understand how to size your graphics, you still want someone to check your work.  Grace called to help out, and even called again after I'd made a sizing mistake.
The quality is brilliant - I'm very happy with their work.  I also appreciate the care they took in packing the prints.  The aluminum work is very pristine, and they were delivered spotless and packed very professionally.  I was so paranoid about getting fingerprints on them, I handled them with cotton gloves while hanging!
Everyone I've met on the team was very enthusiastic about my work.  I can tell they took great care of it from receipt to delivery.  I recommend them highly.</Review>

<Review>POV is awesome. They ran a number of prints for me on 4 different papers and it was done in a few days. Moab Entrata Rag 300 Natural was my favorite paper. The prints look so good I'm going to have an 18"x24" printed and framed. Grace on their team worked with me the whole way. I didn't know anything about paper but Grace walked me through the process and helped me pick the 4 best papers for what I needed. Thank you!!<//Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOIezqgTmyK0hVRoM0R8ur5zFRA7cwSPDlEokV0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOp16KqMQuvN4qekSmseu5bJbkCo726E9m8IBa9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< response>

They are fully setup to handle small and large orders alike; as an individual client ordering just a few prints at a time I'm confident that I'm receiving the same care and attention as clients with much larger orders. Highly recommend!</Review><time>1619466129552</time>< user_id>

<Review>Have had a great experience working with Grace and the team at POV over the past year. All of my photography prints have been amazing quality and delivered to myself or clients in perfect condition.

Just want to say POV are outstanding. This was my first time doing some prints of my art. Being new to printing and the whole process, they really took the time to explain and go through all the different options. I never felt like I was rushed or pushed into something, I could tell they really cared about the outcome of the product. From the initial scanning to receiving the test prints, everything was so smooth and spot on. Also, wow, the prints turned out so good! Couldn't recommend POV enough, excited to get more done in the future.< /Text>

<Text>I am a visual artist and I rely on POV for fine-art printing of my digital paintings. What POV prints is what I exhibit and sell. My initial connection with POV was via Grace, who is my personal printing consultant. It was possible to discuss at length with her my printing needs on the phone. We can communicate with text, too. She helped me navigate the POV site for submission of files to print and get test prints. We discussed and tried a variety of papers. The results have been excellent. Even the test prints are  packaged for shipping in a very professional way.</Text></record></dataset><record>

It was my first time having prints made of my artwork and I’m extremely pleased with the experience I had with POV. It was a bit clunky since I’d never done it before combined with the fact that the store is not open for guests right now so it required many calls, emails, texts and visits back and forth. That said, I’m extremely happy with how everything turned out.

First of all, Grace, is absolutely incredible. From the very first phone consultation I had with her, she was so informative and kind and patient. I had tons of questions and even got frustrated a couple of times and she would always manage to make the situation better.

I had several watercolor paintings scanned, printed and then had POV ship them out to my clients. This was definitely the best case scenario for me. The high res scans are fantastic (way better in terms of color matching and accuracy than any photo I could have taken), the prints are beautiful!!! (I had test prints done first to find the right paper), and the flat pack shipping was incredibly professional, beautiful and safe for shipping.

I picked up my final prints first so that I could sign them and then return them for shipping. I live an hour away, so picking up, taking them home and then returning them the same day was an ordeal. The prints were packed in a manner that was ready for shipping so once I signed everything, I sealed them back up for shipping prep and went back to POV to drop everything off and hopefully get them to ship out ASAP. I realized once I was almost back home that I accidentally forgot to label the outside of the pieces so POV wouldn’t know which package was which. I was so frustrated that I might have to repeat the whole process over again AND that I had delayed my shipping date by so many days. However, Grace literally saved the day. She opened all of the packages for me, identified the proper recipients AND the team surprisingly got my packages out the next day. I was blown away and so grateful.

Everyone is thrilled with the prints they’ve purchased and I am so grateful to POV for making this possible. 🙏♥️</Review>

I inquired as to whether the studio uses Vegan ink for printing and they were able to provide information on what brand they use. I'm happy to share that the ink is vegan which was a selling point for me!
Their printing quality is done to a high standard and I love that they offer so many qualities of material for printing on.

<text>I’m so happy with my scan, color matching, and giclee prints from POV – Grace and Jeremy are kind and professional – Jeremy suggested to scan my original painting at 600 ppi instead of 300 ppi just in case I ever need to print in larger sizes (they’ll have my scan on file), and Grace called me to review test prints she made on different kinds of paper to look at subtle color differences, all of which she included in my order as a courtesy. They’re the best around.<//text><userid>108403911362935144074< /userid>< Date>

< review>
I recently bought a canvas print of a recreation of a picture from POV. And let me tell you, I couldn’t be happier with the product. The communication with the company was beyond amazing. They called and let me know they might not have it completed in time, but once I told them it was for my partner for our anniversary they told me not to worry and they would have it done on time. The Canvas product is everything I imagined and wanted! It was beautiful and my partner cried from joy when he saw it. We are so so so happy!
Thank you POV!!<//review>

<text>I absolutely love and trust working with POV. Jeremy and Grace have been exceptional in how they have treated me, my work and my patrons. They are detail oriented, very knowledgable, helpful, enthusiastic about what they do and it's an enormous pleasure working with them. The quality of the work is excellent and beyond that, I really appreciate the custom made boxes for each of my prints used for shipping. The system online to order is really easy to navigate and makes the process easy and manageable. Even though I personally had problems with it, moreso because of lack of knowledge, that gap was meant.

Again patience and attention that they gave to me also helped me expand my thinking, process and practice.

Thank you both and to the rest of the team

<Text>After spending two months of quarantine writing and illustrating my first children's book, I did not know where to turn to get my watercolor illustrations scanned.  I talked to every facility in Los Angeles, and found  POV.  They were fast, they have excellent safety procedures in place to deal with Covid, they worked with me on price (because I had a large number of scans), and most importantly, they captured the subtlety and color of my watercolors (some of which are very light).  The scans are beautiful.  I will definitely use POV again.</Text><pics>None</pics><Resp>{'time': 1595379749789, 'text': 'Hi Rebecca! Thank you for the review.

Worked with POV Fine Art Printing Studio recently and left beyond satisfied with my experience. Grace and the team provided me with all the necessary information from printing options to pricing. Originally, I intended to produce my work on paper. But after a visit to POV's super useful physical gallery space (where you can literally see/hold the various printing styles, materials, and techniques) and talking with the veteran print team, I altered my original vision and printed on White Aluminum (16 x 16). Grace walked me through the cost differentials and let me know what to expect: first we would scan the art (300 dpi or 600 dpi depending on your personal needs), then we would print small samples, I would approve said tests, the shop would proceed to final versions, and -- VOILA -- job completed. Beyond happy with the final product. And the whole process took less than two weeks. Absolutely will be working with POV again.</Text>

POV is where it's at for fine art printing in LA! I love working with Grace--she's super helpful and friendly. It's nice to have real people to talk through the printing process with--especially for someone who is new to printing and admittedly pretty clueless about it. There is a lot to learn and the website is full of helpful resources.<//Review>

Creating prints out of my original artwork has been a seamless process with POV. Their site is user friendly and they are incredibly responsive, via phone and text! I have been working with Grace and she is professional and passionate about achieving the best quality for my work. I have already placed numerous orders with POV, and I plan on using their service for my future art needs.<//Text>

POV is extremely easy and a pleasure to work with. Jeremy, Grace, and the rest of the crew are always happy to answer any questions I have had. The website is also amazing. You can find out a ton of information just on the site and can do all the scheduling and purchasing directly through it. I really appreciate that they return my texts/calls in a timely manner and stick to their word regarding a timeline of getting my prints made.< /review>

I was looking for a good print shop for ages, and was very happy and relieved to find POV.  They make working through projects easy and everyone I have sold a print to is impressed with the quality.  I've returned several times now because of their high quality paper, faithful scans and beautiful printing.<//text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>I brought a fairly challenging printing project to POV. It required some creative workarounds to make possible, the kind of thing other printers i talked to didn't want to deal with. What i appreciated most about my experience with POV is that at every turn it was 'how can we make this work?' as opposed to 'we can't make this work.'  Happy to say i'm very pleased with the results:)<//review>< Pics>

<Text>I am so happy I found POV. I am new to the world of professional printing and I can't even believe how amazing this place is.  So many cool things you can do with them. Printing on all kinds of paper, wood, fabric, canvas. Really really inspiring. Great place for artists. Grace was so helpful and made sure that I got great service. Jeremy the owner was also very kind to let me come in to pick up my print when the store was closed over the weekend. I highly recommend this place!<//Text>< gmapID>

I had a quick deadline for an order of UV printing on acrylic with very specific dimensions and POV did an amazing job and delivered on time. I am very happy with the print quality! We also had set up a meeting to consult their capabilities and they were very friendly and do an impressive variety of jobs, so I would definitely return to them in the future.< /review>

<Review>We needed a drawings and an illustration printed with an archival method and paper for a project we have just completed. POV did an amazing job printing a pair of drawings for us that came out absolutely stunning, they look more like lithography than digital printing. an added bonus was that we got two additional prints that were used as tests prints for us to OK the larger prints. The service was great, they were very fast doing the job and the price was very reasonable, Grace was very friendly and attended to our needs.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

I had a client request a large format canvas print (120"x40") who lived in Southern California. I am located in Oregon - what should I do? POVevolving was recommended to be to get this done and delivered. The piece turned out amazing and the client is over the moon. I absolutely love their substrate choices. I got an amazing proof in the mail, then photos of the final piece. It was clearly well made. I did not have a hard and fast deadline, but I would have appreciated being a little more updated on the delivery date, even if was going to be delayed. Larger, high quality pieces always take longer and often rescheduling is fine if you just know in advance.< /review>

I’m so glad I found POVEvolving. They scanned the pieces and reproduced to the finest detail. Grace sat with me and helped me understand my purchasing options the first visit and even provided examples of the quality of work that gets printed there. The pricing is competitive and fair and I was able to communicate exactly what I wished for my art and the orders have been filled in a timely manner to perfection (which is a hard standard for art babies)! I’ll be ordering through them for a long time!< /review>

We had an absolute wonderful experience with Jeremy and the folks at POV. We had an incredibly time sensitive order; the project was complex, and Jeremy was able to execute in exemplary fashion, rendering the piece with wonderful creativity and professionalism. We look forward to bringing many projects Jeremy and the kind folks at POV in the future.</review>

They are happy and excited to help u bring your Art to life! Just picked up another order and they certainly expanded their printing service. After consulting with Grace Ice decided to print on a paper based on her recommendation and im glad I did. Its even more vibrant! Also there is always free parking in their lot ( enter on kohler street) which is an extra perk for a dtla location! Thank you POV my client was super happy with her print!<//review>< pics>

This was the first time I’d ever had museum quality prints made of my photographs, plus with the added stress of needing the prints the following day.  I had an excellent experience at POVevolving Fine Art & Photo Printing Studio.  Both Jeremy and Grace were extremely  helpful and supportive, helping me to narrow my image selection down to 10 prints and giving me perfect paper selection advice.  The quality of the prints turned out excellent!  I highly recommend POVevoling Fine Art & Photo Printing Studio!<//Review>

<Text>I want to personally thank you for all of your assistance - I was a little angry at the start but I do accept responsibility for my error with the timing - However, your customer service and professionalism has been  outstanding - If you are a reflection of your company and the prints are half as good as the service you are providing I will be using POV a lot in the future as my business grows!!! Thank you once again for everything - Sincerely Pat  - Looking forward to seeing the final product - The Final Product was beyond expectations - Outstanding! Highest Recommendation< /Text>< pics>

<text>I came to POVevolving wanting to make some unique, high end prints for an art show, with my CONSUME series. Needing a specific amount of care and consultation, I sought out many printers but found POVevolving to be fantastic. I worked directly with Lauren and Jeremy who took care of me and delivered some amazing prints at the end of the day. I came down a week before I needed the art and met with Lauren, saw samples and felt out what I needed. Literally a day after we met I got booked for a big art show and needed to turn around prints in a week. These were not just ordinary prints but special ordered aluminum. Not only did POVevolving deliver but way under schedule by a matter of 3 days and with no rush charges or anything that most printers ding you on to make more money. When I received the prints I was blown away. They were beautiful.

So I can't say enough, how amazing this company is and how great the people that run it are. I am now a loyal customer and cannot wait to print more art with them. Words cannot explain how much I appreciate the care and kindness my work received at this company.

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND POVevolving. 5 stars aren't enough to say it!</text><username>Hal Hefner<//username>< rate>

<review>Found POV very randomly. I wasn’t sure the material I wanted for my Art to be printed on. Upon my first appointment I had so many samples and styles to choose from. I was pretty naive but they made me a few test samples and I found the perfect one.  I’m so completely excited for the Canvas Print they Made Me. This Portrait is so Beautiful. Jeremy was the best from the first visit to the last. He and Grace were very Helpful and Professional. I highly recommend the Team at POV. This project from the inception was very important to me and the culmination of the finalized Piece stands up to some very strict artistic standards. That’s what seems to be their norm. I will definitely be back.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

I'm a multimedia photography artist. I'm undertaking an entirely new product and process that involves large format prints from film scans. The only paper that works for what I'm doing is Hahnemuhle Bamboo. I needed a studio that would totally hold my hand through the entire process because I've never done anything like this before. I found POV on Google and flew from my home in Salt Lake City to Los Angeles to meet with them. They did not disappoint! A fantastic, professional team that's totally customer oriented. Their personal attention to my needs and all my weird requirements gave me the confidence to proceed, and I haven't looked back. Do not hesitate. Go see them!< /Text>

<Text>Absolutely SUPERB in every respect! What a breath of fresh air it is to work with such knowledgeable, informative and thoroughly pleasant professionals as Jeremy and Grace. I have used several fine art photography printers in Los Angeles and POV is in a class of its own! The superior quality of POV's work is breathtaking and they offer services that leave other printers in the dark. Their follow-up and customer service are impeccable and nothing is too much trouble. I was over the moon to find fine-art printing experts who clearly love what they do, and who go the extra mile while remaining competitive in price. Win-win!

I submitted a rush order from Canada for an aluminum print and these guys delivered 5 star service. Communication was instant with photos  and video of the item along the way during production. My rush order was even delivered earlier than I expected. They knocked it out of the park on all aspects of this job. I was blown away. I’m not often this impressed and seldom write reviews either way. But if you’re looking for the type of service this company offers- look no further. Thanks to everyone!< /Text>

They scanned the photo so now I have a great digital copy in .tif format. Even the test prints were amazing so I ended up framing them as gifts too. I highly recommend POV's services to others!< /Review><Time>1552888950828</Time>< Pictures>

<Text>Lauren is extremely professional and clearly experienced in her trade. I went there for a high definition scanning for a piece of artwork and it came out better than the other two scans that I had done of the same piece at other places. I had three scans done to have options on which to make my proof and theirs was the easy pick. Highly recommended.< /Text>< name>

<Review>I brought Lauren a project that was dear to my heart. I had been told that it was nearly impossible to execute, so I had exceedingly low expectations. She was knowledgeable, reassuring and confident. Her love and enthusiasm for art is infectious. Well, the execution of my project was flawless - Superb attention to detail, breathtaking color matching on a high quality canvas. I am already looking for another project and I recommend them highly.</Review><gmap_id>0x80c2c63f098b33f5:0x6030947f59025a8< /gmap_id><username>DePorres Howard</username></record>

Lauren did such an amazing job making sure my prints came out to perfection. If you are looking to get your fine art printed, this is the only way to go in LA. Located next to the American Apparel factory and home to many other creative companies, it makes each visit a super cool, fun experience (and the Povevolving team are young and hip and know where it's at)! 5 stars.<//Text>

A great service for artists! I am a novice at preparing my artwork to be printed even though I know photoshop. Grace has been very patient with me. This took the pressure off. I've gotten five of my pieces photographed/scanned and then reproduced at POV. The results are awesome!< /text>

After receiving very poor quality cards from vista print and having to wait for a marginally better replacement, I gave up on them. I decided to try a local place and picked POVevolving Fine Art Printing Studio because of the positive reviews. Long story short, the cards look amazing and they finished 2 days before the estimated time!</Review>

Their location is very discrete within the busi-ness of DTLA, but when you're inside, everything is calm.

<rating>5</rating><review>We needed 30+ prints for a gallery show last minute and Lauren and the team at Povevolving were amazing.  Their rush charges were really reasonable (especially compared to some companies that wanted to charge us 2 to 3 times the price) and the prints looked amazing.  Highly recommend.</review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

<review>AMAZING! On so many Levels! I cannot say enough about POV. I am an artist and have had the pleasure of working with Grace regularly. No matter where I am, she, and everyone at POV truly make every effort to make every image all that it should be. They take great interest that their clients feel understood and strive only to meet a standard of excellence. POV is a rare gem. I feel so fortunate to have found them. I wouldn't go anywhere else< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<review>Got a price quote from Jeremy on the phone for a digital scan of commissioned artwork for a book cover. Lauren gave the same price when I showed up for the appointment. Great directions provided to their location, over the phone. I was in and out in 10 minutes for the drop-off, so the parking was free. Project completed on time, scan looked great, artwork intact. In and out to pick up the artwork on day of completion, less than 10 minutes so parking was free again. Care and consideration with each customer (remembered project, remembered name) fairly uncommon in LA, but not lost with POVevolving. Good group with whom to work, price is more than competitive, and great service. I will recommend them to others, and encourage all who read this: they do good work; efficient process; completion timeframe achieved; friendly and knowledgable. They have the coolest double helix Archimedes slide in the building where their office is, from the original function of the warehouse: a work of art in itself which added to my good experience.</review>< Date>

<Text>I used POV Evolving to scan/photograph all my paintings.  I needed the work done quickly and it had to be perfect from the start because of a small window before a show going up within 3 weeks of dropping off my work. Lauren at POV handled everything and was beyond helpful.  The pieces small enough to scan were done quickly and she handled arrangements with their go-to photographer for the bigger pieces.  I worked with her after approving proofs to create limited run archival prints that came out beautifully. Pricing was fair, the work was done flawlessly and i could not have been happier.   i recommend them without reservation.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Rate>5< /Rate>< Gmap_id>

I moved from NY and have been trying out a few printers. POV's on-boarding was sloppy IMO. I ended up canceling the order before they completed it because it made me concerned about the quality I'd receive in the end or in the long term. I see a lot of people pleased so maybe it was just me that received frustrating service. They still have a 4.8 or 4.9 so go ahead and go with them... hopefully they will correct the problems I will list below...

(for the people at POV...
As you know, the photographer/printer relationship is very important to many of us. We are trusting you with our work and mistakes are costly. We are VERY loyal to our printers once we find the one we like. After a decade of printing, I've worked with a few printers and I cannot tolerate any sloppiness. Poor customer service is a huge red flag and I feel its good to let other customers and you know where things went awry.. So here is my suggestions to avoid more people leaving 2 star reviews:

- I'd suggest making it so that customers can pay when we place the order. It's a pain to upload and place an order, then have to go back to your site to pay in the middle of the week when we are busy shooting or doing other things... then go back to pick up. We have things to do and can't be glued to your ordering process. I don't know of any other printer that requires three points of interaction for a sale. We order and pay, then pick up.... or we order then pay at pick up. But not order to initiate the sale.... pay a few days later to REALLY initiate the sale... then pick up.

- when someone walks in to ask to check out your paper stock: Just show it! It shouldn't be hard to show them rather than tell them to come back in 2 hours or make an appointment for later in the week. I know you're a small team but this was a pain considering you're in the middle of skid row and 99% of printers are ok with simple walk-ins checking paper. It takes 3 mins to show paper stocks and this is LA where everything is spread out. (I noticed you responded to this review before I even got to type out this manifesto.... maybe spend less time worrying about your reviews and more time helping the people who walk in your door?)

- Also, it would be nice if you just look up and acknowledge people when they walk in. I walked in and stood there for about 45 seconds before I did one of those "cough- hello.... you going to acknowledge someone is here?!" Even just look up and nod and say "one sec" (again... responding to reviews is probably a lower priority than acknowledging the people who trek through Skid Row to become customers)

- If you have an auto-response saying "We'll get back to you," then you probably want to actually get back to your customers rather than have them contact you. (or you can just respond to online reviews... See a pattern here? My fear was "I this how they ALWAYS treat their customers?!")

- You're charging extra for leaving the edges raw. This meant that it takes a $90 print to nearly $100+. Most other printers just include this. Be a team player.

- I was told by Grace when viewing paper that you charge to put prints in a tube. I didn't see this on the invoice and it just confused me... it made me question the communication - did I hear wrong? Was I going to be charged in the end? Is this a "sometimes we do, sometimes we don't" thing?

- Telling customers "You need to tell us when you want it" is f'n weird. So if a customer doesn''t say "I need this ASAP" they're thrown at the end of the line and told "you should have known to tell us you wanted it in 3 days rather than 5 days! Sit at the end of the line" 99% of businesses handle their orders on a first come-first serve basis UNLESS someone is paying for rush.

I appreciate that you tried to correct the problem but it wasn't just ONE problem. It was a series of neglect. I've been printing my work for over 10 years and this really was the worst on-boarding experience I've had. I truly have faith that you do really well for the majority of your clients but I didn't get that great service.</Text>

{'time': 1539984231705, 'text': 'UPDATED: Im going to happily take another minute to reply here to what you came back to type, as I actually do appreciate that you took that much time to type an epic \'manifesto\' - as you called it. So, I\'ll go one by one here:\n\nPaying when you place the order, etc // I actually agree that this is too many steps, however, everything we do is custom work - nothing cookie cutter - no standard sheets - no standard sizes, etc .. and that inherently takes more time. After a client has started working with us we let them pay at pick up or at any point in the process, but since we don\'t know you, we would not do that on your first order.\n***\nRegarding your upset about waiting for 45 seconds when you got here // I do understand that those first few seconds might be uncomfortable, but you can certainly say hello as well. We\'re very friendly. We don\'t bite. Beyond that, we note clearly on our google page, yelp page, and on many pages on our website, that we work by appointment. If you make an appointment you may be surprised by how generous we are with our time.\n***\nThe "We\'ll get back to you" response // Thats not automated at all. We\'re going one by one and making sure that real life breathing humans are replying to everything here.\n***\nCharging extra for leaving edges raw // Correct. We charge by the sheet size. This is fully built into our pricing online and we\'re very up front and clear about this.\n***\nCharging to put the prints in a tube // We charge for the actual tube itself, or other packing materials that you require. We don\'t charge to put something in the tube. Beyond our printing, we offer fully custom packing services.\n***\nRegarding deadlines // Its very normal to ask for a client to specify a deadline. We actually don\'t work with "ASAP", and require actual dates and times. Nobody gets \'thrown to the end of the line". We manage hundreds of jobs per month based on our stated turn around times, as well as customer specified deadlines.\n***\nLet us know if you want to try again! We\'ll be happy to help you. It seems that you came to us with a very specific way that you are used to working, and - with a tiny bit more patience - you may have actually found that we can absolutely take care of what you need.\n\nTake care for now! No hard feelings on our side. - Jeremy\n\n****\n\nTHIS WAS OUR INITIAL REPLY:\n\nHi Michael, not sure why you would leave a 2 star review, as we haven\'t even worked with you. Your pending job would have been done the same day that you finally confirmed it, as an exception, despite the fact that we are very clear about the turn around time on all orders.\n\nWe explained in detail why it took us over 24 hours to reply to your initial inquiry; something that is rare for us - but does happen on occasion with the volume of jobs that we process.\n\nYou followed up with an email letting us know that you understand that, and then asked us to continue with your order. We agreed to do it same day for you, which certainly is going above and beyond to make sure you get what you need.\n\nWe even called you to make sure you received our email in order to complete your job same day.\n\nPerhaps you were upset when we explained that we charge by the sheet size instead of having extra white space around your prints at no cost...? This is standard, noted, and built into our price calculator on our website.'}<//Resp>

My first time using Urgent Care, the front desk staff was super friendly. I didn’t wait long to get called, the MA was kind and helpful. The PA that actually saw me was super informative, helpful and super nice!! He really even went out his way to call me after hours to read my lab results! I’m like can I get you as my primary care Dr. I would recommend this urgent care to anyone.</review>

They did a great job, stitched me up in no time, in and out! Much better than waiting 6 hours in the ER plus helps take the strain off of them.< /Review>

< review>
I visited this facility a few weeks ago. Wow.  Worst experience I've ever had in my life regarding visiting a physician's office. The medical assistant was rude for no apparent/obvious reason. But the dr. who saw me was extremely rude, combative and borderline aggressive. If I could give 0 review I would. Also, I'm not the type of person that leaves reviews often at all.  The doctor's name is Dr. Brian James Eberle.  If this is the doctor that you are set to see, my recommendation is be aware and to maybe reconsider asking for a new physician if you feel uncomfortable like I did. Nobody deserves to feel the way he made me feel. I left in the middle of my appointment with him. I apologized and said I just didn't feel comfortable and he just smirked at me and stared and me and didn't say anything.  I will never be back at this facility and if I ever am to see this dr again I will leave abruptly.  Horrible experience.</review>

I went in for a skin infection because my regular provider wasn't going to have an opening for another week. The woman at the front desk was super nice and helpful. I waited a bit but that's was no problem since I had walked in. The Dr. was great. She looked at my skin, answered all my questions and gave me a prescription I could pick up that evening.</review>

This is the third time I have used this urgent care and again it was 5 STARS!

They are organized and run well. No wait to speak of as you select your appointment in line. They are all highly professional and knowledgeable.

They are prompt with notifications and support.

My MD was very thorough and compassionate!

Covid test results were back before 24 hours!

They deserve 5 ⭐️<//review>

<Text>I was at this clinic on 12/31/2019.   I have only good things to say about this clinic and the people there.   I was there also a year ago, and it was the same experience:  The clinic is sparkling clean, the  people are friendly and professional, everybody knows that they are doing, and I got the help I needed.  I highly recommend this urgent clinic.  If I could give it a 10, I would, but I can only give it a well deserved 5.   By the way, I am an out of state patient, so I only use the clinic when passing through to some other destination.  I am thankful that this clinic is on my way.  I do not understand the negative reviews I read.  They cannot possibly be objective.</Text>< user_id>

Expert care. The doctor was great with my 1 year old son. She made him laugh and feel comfortable which helped him be less scared when she took care of his wound. She did a great job.<//Text>

*** Update. Got a call from the billing department today June 26th. They were calling because as of this date nothing has been correctly charted in my file. They basically said no on wrote down how you were injured or when the injuries happened. The woman was very rude and started to ask for personal information I am not comfortable giving out over the phone. This is medical negligence!! ****

If at all possible be seen at a different location. I was in a car accident and came here. The office staff was not well trained. Only one person knew how to do anything and all the other staff were constantly asking questions or waiting for her to ask a question so they could check someone in. It took a bit to see a dr. The exam was very brief. No x-rays, no eye exam to check for concussion, rough physical exam. I told them I had recently go off birth control and they never did a pregnancy test. These are all standard things for someone in a car accident. The dr was going to prescribe a medication. When the nurse came me and told me I could go she handed me a packed that showed nothing had been called in. When I asked her about the medication she looked at the paperwork and to my surprised ask "who did you see" I said I did not know the drs name. There was no record in the whole clinic of who had even saw me. She then left the room and I heard her and other nurse talking. The Dr that saw me had basically walked out of exam room and left. My chart was not written up, no prescription was noted or called in, and the Dr just left! I had to wait and until another Dr. could see me again. The new Dr comes in and I have go over everything again. She then ask "what was the med she going to give you" I AM NOT THE DR?! THIS SHOULD ALL HAVE BEEN WRITTEN DOWN. I will never come here again.</Text>

I'm always treated well here when I'm unable to get in to see my regular doctor. Having the option to save my spot online also speeds up my visit. I'm never left waiting long and their care has been great so far. Grateful that they do what they do.< /Review>

<Review>WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!
I spent 2 hrs and $50.  In return i got less than 10 mins with a health care professional, no testing and a response of lets wait and see.  A week later I went to a another better urgent care facilities; was in and out in less than 30 minutes, got the prescription i needed and now feel 100% better.<//Review><Name>Eric Lucking< /Name></record>

Beware using this facility if you have Humana insurance!  My co-pay for an urgent care facility is different from an emergency room visit.  I went in to St Joseph Urgent Care for an upper respiratory problem and got some antibiotics.

The urgent care facility bills thru the hospital and their billing to the insurance indicated an emergency room procedure resulting in a higher co-pay for me.  Repeated calls to the billing department met with a "It's not our mistake, we billed correctly" response.

I finally gave up and paid the emergency room deductible.  From now on, I'll use someone else.</Review>

<Review>Excellent service went in after dog attack and bites - one very deep. Front desk awesome. Rosalia the nurse very attentive and cleaned wound and readied me for dr. Dr explained everything and swiftly examined and stitched deep wound. Nurse Rosalia applied antibiotic salve an dressed wounds impeccably, gave me tetanus shot. They Sent me home with prescription for ibuprofen and antibiotics and info on dog bites. Highly recommend for urgent care. Very clean calm atmosphere.<//Review>< pics>

<Pics>None<//Pics><Text>This place sucks.  I cant believe how long I had to wait here (I was left in the exam room for over an hour).  Only upon exiting and wandering around the halls did a doctor come speak to me.  Then they left me for another 45 mins. They botched the most basic of medical treatments, which left me bleeding and could've done permanent damage.

I am not even exaggerating.  Stay away from this place, it is a bad experience at best, and I wouldn't trust them to clip my toenails.< /Text>< name>

Everyone here is ok unless they are helping someone who fight an addiction to drugs. Then again mostly everywhere in Sonoma County with Doctors nurses assistants etc. Or all staff at all of the hospitals, treat people like they are a waist of air and have no compssion, terrible bedside manner and make people with addictions terrified to go and b treated anywhere. It's truly disgusting. Especially because everyone on earth has some sort of addiction to something weather u view it good or bad two much of anything is bad. Anyways the worst most unprofessional delusional self centered self ricious ugly from the inside out who constantly breaks confidentiality is and think she's better then everyone on earth is LAURA MARCUS Who actually was fired from heildsburg hospital for some sort of drama breaking someones confidentiality I believe not sure the exact story but close enough. Anyways this place gets a 3 and a half stars unless she is their.</Review>

If I could put no stars I would this place really sucks there staff doesn’t no what there doing I went in about few months ago and had to have a butt shot “first the lady said it won’t hurt that bad just a little sting and then she didn’t tell me to lay down for it so I leaned over the bed and was told to put a gown on nothing on underneath and next thing you no she injected me and I started to feel this excruciating pain i said omg it’s hurting really bad and I could suddenly feel this shock pain go down my whole  right leg and then all I can see is black then next thing u no I’m laying on the floor  with 1 doctor and 2 nurses spraying my face with water and I woke up to find my bottom half of body showing and not remembering what happend till they said I passed out and I could here the nurses talking loudly about what happend saying we didn’t no she passes out with shots and notifying there higher person in charge and then the lady told me same things u should’ve let us no u don’t do good with shots I was like what the heck I’ve had 2 kids honey natural with one and epidural shot with the other I take pain pretty dam well  u really think a shot hurt me that bad to pass out i didn’t say that to her but that’s what was going thru my head I completely stared crying and called my bf who was so angry wanting to come talk to them and they kept me for another 30 min just to make sure my head was fine they just felt my head and I waited 30 min and they sent me on my way I then had to call my bf to come pick me up kuz I was still dizzy and scared and I ended up having to go to the er due to really bad pain in the area she gave me the shot And I also was experienceing headaches due to the fall cause I had hit my head and the doctor there at the er told me I had a small concussion and I had asked her what about the pain in that area and I told  her this has never happen to me before and she said it sounds like she hit your siotic nerve and that hurts really bad and most likely that’s y u passed out cause of the pain I was so shocked to no that u put your trust in these ppl and u can end up with permanent damage after doing my research  !! And the funny thing was the main person that controls urgent care I forgot who they said they were had been blowing my phone up telling me there gana do another training with there staff and very sorry for what happend and kept telling me please let us no if u end up going to the er or of any changes and literally called me for few days straight I believe they were worried I was going to take them to court or something but for her to say that she’s going to train her staff again completely shows u I was not in good hands and it was 100% there fault ! And few months later here i am experienceing some bad painI in that area that has been interfering with my life and kids and now finding my self making a doctor appointment for this pain wondering if it’ll ever go away or get worse thanks to urgent care very disappointed and I’m not stating on here what my intentions are at this point but I’m deff warning everyone to be careful and always take someone with u if your going to get a shot or something in that matter just In case something happends like that u want to make sure your safe  !</review>

They kicked me out while I was hallucinating. Had an amazing conversation with a traffic light for a few hours, went back to ask if I could use a phone to get home and they threatened to call the cops.

That said, otherwise it's a nice place. The other times I went were fine.</Text>

<text>I have HMO, went to ER and paid the copay. Then, a couple of months later I get a letter from St Joseph Urgent Care with threats of sending a $300 charge to a collection agency. Never got any bill before and loosing hours on this. The admin staff is totally incompetent. Avoid at all cost.< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Ive been there several times and I have had no problems. Yesterday I showed up at 6:15 there was a note on the door saying, "Due to unforeseen matters we are not open." So I went in tonight at 6:30. There was 1 person befote me and 1 person after me. My named was called at 7:12 where I was taken to a room. The person after me was in a room nearby. The doctor saw him before me. By this time it was 7:50 so I got up and walked out. The security guard said to me, " Oh! That was fast." I said, " Are you kidding me? I haven't been seen yet!" I walked out and left. No one in the office even seen me leave cause most of the employees had already left. Do you think as a woman I would want to be left there alone with a doctor and a security guard? Not on your life! So I will never go there again! I only gave it a 2 cause before yesterday they've been pretty good.</Review>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><Review>I felt very disrespected! I have my insurance with Kaiser but it was being transferred back to Santa Rosa from Marin so I was not able to go to Kaiser.The Doctor was very impersonal and treated me like I was a ignorant child. She didn't have any bedside manner. She looked like she was srtung out on drugs! I Dont trust that place! Very sad that they do not care about their patients!🙁😷😓< /Review><Time>1528922448557<//Time><user>106047586002969111797<//user><response>None< /response>< Name>

<Text>My husband ran an oyster knife through his hand in July 2015, at Dillon Beach. We specifically looked up an urgent care and found this one. We were concerned he might need antibiotics from the shellfish to hold him until we got home to see his PCP.
Upon arrival he completed "urgent care paperwork."  The doctor gave him a tetanus immunization, squeezed on his hand and sent him home. We received a bill that included "pain medication administration" among other things, including an entirely separate bill from the numbscull physician- totalling well over $1,000.
When we tried to fight it with our insurance- first for the fact the bill had completely falsified data on it, and then for the fact that the bill we received was an Emergency Room Hospital Bill for Santa Rosa Memorial, we were denied.

At this point I am not only disgusted with the system, but this facility, along with our insurance company and frankly tired of the lack of transparency in the medical billing industry un general. I will be calling local media outlets and likely hiring an attorney to fight this. But if you are looking for an urgent care DO NOT GO HERE your Emergency Room rates and deductibles will apply because they are publicly lying and stating they are urgent care.

Not to mention because of the lack of care received my husband has permanent nerve damage in two of his metacarpals.<//Text>< pics>

They closed before 7. Yes, it was 6:55pm but it's said 7-7; so that's what it shld be. When I kept knocking the staff pretended not to hear me and 1 guy smirked while *really* looking at his phone while the lady behind the counter who had her purse, sweater and keys in hand pretended to look at papers. LAME. You're there for the sick, not yourselves. Remember the oath? Disgusting<//review>

Wonderful staff and Doctor. They were great with my 7 year old and because her illness was viral, Dr. West prescribed meds for the pain instead of antibiotic. The wait was long, but I guess that's to be expected with an urgent care.< /Review>

After my initial visit the physician called me back the same day, saying my tests results were strange. They had me come back in two days after my appointment for more lab tests and bloodwork. After over a week, I had to call them just to hear the nurse say, "Oh. We didn't find anything in your lab work. You're welcome to visit us again." I have to pay for two urgent care visits and they aren't even inclined to help diagnose me. Waste of money and time.< /text>

< Review>
I have only ever paid $20 for an urgent care visit through other hospitals, but here the way they did their billing I had to pay $20 twice, once up front and then two months later I received a bill. They said I was charged a hospital bill and a bill for the physician, which seems like BS and does not make sense to me since this is an outpatient facility, and the physician saw me for 5 seconds and then I had to sit there for 20 mins while he wrote up 3 prescriptions for me to go pick up. I would advice against going here, it is a time and money suck.</Review>

<review>Billing nightmare.  They used the wrong billing codes, billing as hospital not urgent care.  Furthermore there were two separate billing entities, the doctor and the facility.  The doctor billed from out of state, compounding the problem (out of state coverage is different).

What should have been a simple visit to xray a bone turned in to a year and a half billing nightmare.  I even got sent to collections!  They refused to change the billing codes to reflect the services provided, and my insurance said that they were also unable to change the codes.

I was ready to take legal action because to me it seemed like billing fraud, but luckily my persistance paid off and I eventually it got covered.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<review>Bait and switch.  St. Joseph Urgen Care touts itself as an urgent care but bills as an emergency room.  Most health insurance providers interpret St. Josephs bills as an emergeny room visit which is usually mean a much higher copay for the insured.  Double check with your provider before coming here!</review>< Pics>

Definitely a hidden gem! Their decor team is on point! And their customer service is great. When I first walked in I was impressed on how elegant it looked inside. The staff was very helpful before and the day of my event. They made me feel so comfortable and I can't thank them enough! I recommend this place for anyone interested in having a stress free event where someone else takes care of everything for you.<//Text>

The DJ guy who was in charge of the music kept messing up playing the wrong song to the Waltz. He kept stopping the music he did not display my daughters pictures when she was little. The soda they served was flat. I originally had invited 220 guest only about 150 showed and the people from the hall would not give my guess second plate.  I paid a lot of money for this event it's my money that I gave for a nice party not a cheap party. They should use their own time to clean not your time that you paid for party time. The party was suppose to end at 12 midnight and they stopped it at 11:30 to start cleaning. They use your paid time to clean. I do not recommend. Then I forgot my red buckets I rented for the kegs of beer to keep the beer cold. They told one of my guest who was helping take my things to our cars that the red buckets stay there. I had to go back and claim them obviously they tried to keep them for themself, that means they also steal from their clients who keep them in business. They did not serve the chicken I requested. They served something different. Horrible customer service.</Review><pics>None< /pics><Response>{'time': 1564517534732, 'text': "I am sorry for your bad experience. However, our DJ is not responsible for your production or your recordings that someone else produced for you. Only you are responsible for your content that you want displayed. If it isn't organized or compatible with our system like it was in your case, we can try to help you but it does not mean we have to fix it for you. This is a courtesy that is not included in any of our packages that we offer. In regards to the soda, we don't make the soda. However, if someone would have notified that the soda was flat, we would quickly replace it but nobody mentioned anything. I am very sorry that the guest you invited didn't all show up. Regarding the food, nobody asked for a second plate. If anyone asked for seconds and someone said no, you should have immediately talked to the manager that was there. In your contract it is specified that 30 min before your event ends, we start cleaning. You should know this because it is in your contract."}< /Response>< Gmap_id>

All our guest loved the food it was absolutely delicious. I would highly recommend this hall to anyone. Thank you Fandango banquet hall for all your hard work that night. It was a night our daughter will never forget.<//Review>< Pics>

A great hall to plan an event the price is defenitly worth tbe price. The price may seem a little high but as if you continue to search for hall in the area trust me you will realize that the price you get will truly be worth every cent you pay.< /text>

His behavior was so angry that I immediately went into the store and informed the manager.

<Review>Very pleased with the carpet. Tom was our salesperson and stayed in touch with us. The carpet we chose ended up going on sale plus no tax. Ended up being quite reasonable. My installer says the carpet is good quality and the pad is excellent. Ran into a small snag when they neglected to call when it came in. Took a little patience to get someone to answer the phone and locate it. Everything else went smoothly. Considering Lowes and Home Depot can't get any carpet until after Christmas this was a quick turnaround. Got two of the three bedrooms installed yesterday and it looks great.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<review>I got my carpets from them several years ago. We ordered a waterproof pad with high end carpet and when we had the carpet took out from new carpet they told us they gave us the cheap stuff and the pad was not waterproof. Would not recommend.< /review>< user>

Well I was at S&G carpet today to pick out carpet colors.  We had carpet installed by S&G several years ago.  The installation went very well and we were totally satisfied.  But this year the carpet has developed rinkles in the hallway so I asked them to re-stretch  it.  They sent two different crews to do the work but both said that the hallway had too many doorways off of it and it could be re-stretched  properly.  S&G agreed and so they are now going to replace all the carpet at no cost to us.  I can't say enough good about S&G!!!</text>

The flooring is beautiful!  The install, perfect!  I could not be happier.  The installers, Jose and Antonio, oh my goodness....the best.  They were fast, professional, very pleasant and at the end of each day you couldn't tell they were here.  They cleaned up every bit of their mess (work debris).  Very hard workers, and they laughed and sang the whole time.  I feel so very blessed to have Jose and Antonio for the install!  Thank you S&G Carpet.<//Text>

<Text>I used them for a project. They said they had flooring in stock so I ordered, a month later still not in stock. No customer service or apology regarding. A very small discount was offered for delaying our remodel substantially. Wont be using them again or referring any more clients to them.</Text></record>

< Review>
I am highly suspicious of the positive reviews.

We called them for a measuring and cost estimate which resulted in first, waiting on hold while they “logged on “for several minutes, then we received 4 texts on Mother’s Day from someone who never identified herself by name
asking for carpet color preferences. Very bad business practice to bother people on a Sunday and a family day. She then failed to reply to her own questions 4 texts later. We had to ask her for confirmation of her appointment time change.

The person who came to measure told us he would email the estimate that day. He never did, that day or ever. Just disappeared. I am now receiving phone calls from out sources so I suspect they sell your information.

He did, however, tell us if we signed on the dotted line that day he would give us a “ great deal”. Very unprofessional and a rediculously high verbal cost estimate. We bought elsewhere and I advise you do the same.< /Review>

Jonathan helped me in the Elk Grove Store, and explained the quality of carpets, pricing, and availability. Then he left me alone (which I appreciated). He answered all my questions and then took multiple phone calls from me over a few days throughout my deliberation process. Customer service was excellent. The carpet installers were professional and efficient. I’m leaving off one star because the labor was more costly than I liked, however S&G did work with me on cost of carpet and padding. They also met Home Depot’s quote, and we’re available in days as opposed to weeks! Would definitely recommend S&G Carpet.<//Text><name>Martina Young< /name><Gmap_id>0x809ac702ffdfd3d7:0x54bfe40ba8bb7b8c<//Gmap_id>< Time>

The installation crew, led by Bob Carr, was quick getting the job done one day quicker than had been projected. They also did a real bang up job. We are very happy with our new floor.

Just wanted to say that after an extensive hunt for for carpet, comparing everyone out there and what they had to offer and all the quotes, we went with S & G carpet and they match the best price we found and we were able to get it installed ASAP in time for the Holidays. Tara was great in the sales dept and Max , who installed it was awesome!!! No one came close being able to get our carpet installed till after the holidays but S & G had it made, shipped from Georgia and installed all in about 3 weeks. They were great!!!<//review>

S&G Carpeting did a great job installing carpet throughout our house. 8 months later we had a water leak while we were out of town. After we dried out the carpet, S&G replaced the pad in the areas affected by the water leak. We were very satisfied with their workmanship. We highly recommend S&G for the quality of their carpet, their customer service, and their expert installers!< /Review>

Everyone who works for this company is wonderful. I had visited a few other companies when I wanted new carpet for my house but when I walked into this branch, I felt like I was home. The pricing, feel, and people are all around genuine and a pleasure to do work with!<//Text>

If anyone is thinking of getting new flooring, I highly recommend "Not" to waste your time shopping around at any BIG BOX stores. Unlike those stores, Julie Santos at S&G Carpet, EG gave our family the Red Carpet treatment.  Julie knows her store and her product.  We came in with samples and pricing from other stores and Julie not only gave us better quality flooring but also pricing was Great!

The installers were on time and professional.  They take a lot of pride on their work.

Our home looks great and there is nothing better than the smell of new carpet and hardwood floors.

Julie, thank your professionalism, great work ethics and I believe we have a new friend. :-)</text>

We purchased wood flooring from S&G to be installed by our own installer and when the wood arrived it did not appear to be what we ordered.  At the end of the day it was what was ordered but it was severely misrepresented by the manufacturer of the wood.  However, S&G went out of there way to make it right even though it was not something that was their fault.  As it was something that the manufacturer of the wood was responsible for we did not expect anything from S&G and not only did they make it right but they offered to correct the matter without us even asking.  They have wonderful customer service and would definitely do business with them in the future.</text>

Horrible service, the younger lady who worked there tried to belittle me. She told me I would get exactly what I ordered... I did not. Came back the next day to fix the mistake she made on my order, the staff said they could not help me and that I could pay more money to have my order made again but this time for way more money. Bottom line they took my money, gave me the wrong order, made no attempt to fix the issue. Horrible service and horrible way to do business. Will not be going back again. Please don’t make the same mistake I made and choose another flooring store.</text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>A huge 'thank you' to Bayyinah and Robert for their patience, professionalism and expertise in assisting my wife to select new flooring for our remodel. It was a frightfully small installation, but they were SO helpful in making the selection process easy with a wide selection of flooring options. We found S&G VERY easy to do business with and their pricing was competitive. Would purchase from them again in a heartbeat.<//review>< Resp>

<Text>The price is reasonable, got real great quality carpet, they come to the house to give estimates and scheduled appointment but the actual people installing were very unprofessional and rude, I never scheduled the rest of the house to be done.

<Review>Walked in this afternoon not knowing what to expect and walked out with amazing nails. Staff was very friendly and made me feel very comfortable. By far the best experience ive had at any salon. Definitely will be back again.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Time>1582749416269< /Time><Rate>1<//Rate><text>So I never have felt the need to write a bad review until today. I have been to this establishment many times over the past several months and previously enjoyed my experience and even received good service with Jasmine. However, I went in just over a week ago and got a gel fill with the color 863. A day after visiting two nails peeled completely off, I called and booked another appointment to fix them. Since then I have been back a total of four times to have them fix the endless chipping I experienced with their polish as well as several broken nails. I haven’t been rough with my nails at all, yet they all broke doing the slightest tasks, like scratching my dogs back or grabbing a folder, for example. When I had visited the last time on Friday, I was told by Jasmine if the polish chipped once again she would fix them for me for free, and this was verified on the phone with me when I called this Monday to book the repairs. But, when I went in today to have Jasmine once again fix three broken/cracked nails and two chipped nails, I was stopped after my appointment and asked to pay and there was no getting around that. I wouldn’t have gone back for this repair if I hadn’t been promised that they would be fixed for free. I will never be coming back. This is the worst service and experience I have ever had at any nail salon in the two years I’ve been having them done. If you want your nails done right the first time I don’t recommend coming to this establishment.</text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Fast and excellent quality work! Such reasonable price for gel manicure ($35 and that included cuticle trim and hand/arm massage) They also give patrons mango, strawberry or green tea ❤❤❤ Lee was great. She was gentle and did an EXCELLENT job. I'll be back for sure!!!</Text>

<Text>This is my normal nail place, but there are a couple of things that are really frustrating about it.
Let me start with the positives, the customer service and my nail lady Jasmine are amazing.

The downside is that their phone never works, and I don't understand why they won't get it fixed and they are much more pricey than other places in town.<//Text>< rate>

In the area after a doctor appointment. Went in for a fill. (First time customer) I was turned away after I told the girl I needed a fill. Guess I wasn't spending enough money, and not the right skin color because no one else was turned away. Horrible!! They should be ashamed of themselves. I'll never return to this racist salon!< /Review>

{'time': 1630166836561, 'text': 'Hello !\nSorry you misunderstood/misread the paper on the door that ACTUALLY says:\nIn order to help maintain Social Distancing only 1 person at a time allowed inside (It might change soon to up to 2 clients at a time...?)  please Call when you arrive to the front door.\nThis is to help maintain a personal health safety-zone while inside this business during this pandemic, as I do overly care for each & every persons health, tattoo &/or body piercing appearances entering & leaving this business. Covid is invisible & does exist despite peoples beliefs, therefore the extra safety measures I take shouldn\'t be frowned on but applauded during these times.\nNOWHERE does it say anything about "appointments" on the nasty piece of paper you are talking about. I mean you did state you came by a few times & still misundedstood the business sign ?\nPlus, appointments are for "TATTOOS ONLY" not Piercings & can only be made after a FREE in person only Tattoo Consultation which doesn\'t require an initial appointment to talk about Tattoos, I dont & haven\'t in a long time do walk-ins for tattoos so theres really no need to put that type of info on that "nasty little paper" you said you seen on 3 different occasions.\nDue to the fact not all people that are a available & willing for work for many months now, who Tattoo or Body Pierce are to the minimum skill levels we will accept to actually work here, there is currently only 1 person who is a multi-award winning tattoo artist & certified Body Piercer who is very qualified working, AT THIS TIME, but that is again, only 1 person working here. Just like some restaurants & other businesses due to lack of actual workers, there is a such thing as patience, understanding & compassion for those of us who actually do want to work & maintain a quality people look for, you know.\nFor those reasons at any given time, a client can be inside during the times you "claimed to" have come by & hands were full & unable to get to the phone at a timely fashion you may be accustomed to.\nThere are surveillance cameras & despite the simple stated business rules on the front door, some people purposely knock on the door instead of call then leave quickly after or call get no answer after 3 rings then leave quickly after, where many other clients have no issues waiting a bit, contacting & getting services done here, this is not a new business. There are also rare times where bathroom services need to be used or last minute supplies picked up or lunch or dinner needs to be eaten or have picked up & the shop "landline phone" cannot be answered or reached at those times.\nThanks for the 3 visits ?  Sorry about the inconvenience in not getting to you over any client(s) before your arrival(s) or whatever the reason(s) may have been during those times as I do really appreciate anybody coming this way. The good news about tattooing & Piercings is theres soo many shops that dont care about current Social Distancing health practices, will hire anyone to put out any type of work (to some it\'s all about the dollars not the quality or health safety of others) & be ready for countless walk-ins (possibly sick or not) without nasty little front door signs.\n-please Stay Safe !'}< /Resp>
< Text>
Stop by 3 times during business hours and  its close. Have a nasty piece paper on the door that stats call for appointments when you call still no answer</Text>

I've known Mike 33 since 1998 maybe 1999 I have over 10 years of tattoos on my body I've seen him really get better in his artwork he's probably the only artist that I know that could do different types of styles I would highly recommend him to anybody for piercings in body artwork. He's very professional and honest in his pricing very reasonable too. I now live in AZ , however I would travel to Cali just to get some work done from him.< /text>

Big mike was very cool. All the reviews were right about how he was. I got my dimples pierced 4 years ago and had to take them out because the other place did them wrong. So I'm glad for a second try I got someone very professional & knew what he was talking about and doing instead of trying to make a quick buck. I give this place a A+<//review>

Great place to go. Got my septum done and Big Mike was so good about it. I was so nervous but he made me feel so much better by walking me through it and let me ask any questions I had about it. And it was a great price for it. He seems really serious and can see how people think he's rude but he's not, he really is a nice guy. And I loved how fast it went by haha. Definitely recommend this place.</review>

I went to Ink Fever to get my piercing re-done, and I’m glad I went to Big-Mike, His knowledge, training and experience is what made me feel the most comfortable. I learned that my previous piercing done by Body-Mod 7 years ago was done incorrectly with not only the wrong type of jewelry but it was also very crooked. If you want reassurance that your piercing will be done correctly, clean and professionally, go to INK FEVER TATTOO!</review>

I went there with my sister to get a piercing and we were real nervous about getting it done but we were able to ask all the questions in the world, before and after or during we were able to talk to him he made us feel comfortable and kept it professional everything was in sterilized packages and opened right in front of me and the process was quick and easy no pain afterwards just felt a little pinch like he said and then it was done and over with. Will definitely becoming back for more piercings!!! Prices are great and customer service was excellent!! Thank you big mike</review>

I would give him 6 if I could. He was so nice, super helpful and over all fast process. Big Mike is such a good guy and outgoing.</Review>

<Text>These reviews are def fake or these people at ink fever are just racist ! They have horrible customer service or they’re just too high to attend to customers . I walked in and Was ignored , I walked up and asked for prices and he was so rude and didn’t have much to say about anything I was asking him ! I was keeping it cool but eventually had to walk out or I was just going to lose my composure! Horrible experience!<//Text>< pics>

Best shop around. If you're price hunting then go to a scratcher in SB or Redlands. If youre looking for quality then come here. He has the plaques on the Wall to back up what he says.<//Review>

I am currently working on a sleeve with Big Mike and  I am in love. Im not even halfway done with it but what I have so far is amazing. I cannot wait for the final product. He may look intimidating but he is very caring. During each session I have he ffrequently asks if I am ok considering a lot of my tattoo is in very tender areas such as the back of my knee and thigh area. For sure I will not go anywhere else for tattoos.<//review>

Dont know how they have a 3.6 rating when clearly it should be a 1.6 dont know any names but big dude that im guessing is the owner is pretty rude, i mean i went in for a piercing and as i walked in i stood there while he was scrolling on his phone, then finally decided to put it down and ask we what i needed. No hello no nothing lol then i remebered my friend and i had gone there about 6 years ago and it clicked that they stay rude, i even persuaded my friend to go somewhere else but she jusy went for it since it was a spontaneous belly piercing.  You can definitely find a way better location.< /Review>

Attend Mass here off and on.  The choir is good, especially the soprano !! Love the priests here. I feel the people who attend could be a little more friendly, go out of their way a little more to make people who are visiting to feel more welcome.</review>

<text>Wonderful community and clean beautiful grounds. Beautiful inside and quiet place to stop by and worship Christ.They have Catholic school on grounds. Great fish diners during Lent. Church helps illegal Hispanics, that the only bad side.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

I was a message to review this venue before visiting.
I have recently returned from California and a wedding at this church.
It is a modern church by my standards , but is a very well appointed place.
It has a very Average appearance for it's size .
But is a Very welcoming Church that said.<//Text>

<review>MUST GO: amazing staff, delicious food, great experience!!
We spontaneously decided to come on a busy weekday and got a table quickly outside. The food was delicious, fresh and came out quickly. The staff was attentive, friendly and ensured we had a great time. There was a small hiccup with the kitchen bringing is the wrong dish though the chef came outside to personally apologize and offer drinks and dessert on the house. Overall probably one of the best customer service experience in San Francisco.
Extra points: our husky was welcome and received special attention and water refills.<//review><user>111068100878185449321< /user>< gmapID>

Excellent choice for getting back to exploring the city.  Spacious rustic main dining room on a corner.  Successful blend of Basque roots and California ingredients.  Some day the cable cars will run again but for now it’s just as charming.< /Review>

The presentation looks great, size is delicate, taste is superb and the ingredients are absolutely in the high quality. Hurry up to be here before it becomes another Michelin-Starred restaurant. So far, it does not serve tasting menu, but I definitely recommend the chef of the cuisine to develop one in the near future.</text>< pictures>

Such a gem!! We went hear for my birthday dinner and the food was incredible. Every dish amazing in its own right. Lived in Spain for years and this paella was better than any paella I ate in Spain! Also very COVID friendly outdoor seating with ample space and heat lamps. Owner was lovely too! Can’t wait to go back here.</Text>

IMPIRTANT: there's a pop-up taqueria serving lunch most days of the week in Abrazo, called Miguelito. It's very good for take away or dining in via their outdoor tables.<//review>

Appetizers, entrees and dessert were very tasty.

Atmosphere was nice especially when more people showed. We arrived in the earlier side to see a show later.

Good for couple night or larger groups and celebrations.

Gave it four stars because the service was just ok. I guess I’m used to slower service in Spain but this is SF so was a bit surprised. Service people were nice though.</Text>

< Review>
Zarzuela was warm and inviting and practically impossible to replace. Abrazo means to embrace and this place does not do that- it is cold and uninviting. They should let the wonderful Spanish memories go with Zarzuela and start from scratch. I’m not sure what this place is trying to be. They are charging $5 (!!!) for bread- a staple in any Spanish restaurant. We ordered the Gambas, which were the highlight of the meal, except one of the best parts of Gambas is dipping bread in the sauce, and they don’t serve it with bread, so yup, $5 more for bread. The lightly fried vegetables were basically tempura (why?!). The polpo was okay but served with rock hard potatoes. And the paella... just does a disservice to the name. My boyfriend referred to it as “soupy hard rice”. And it came with 1 shrimp. Just 1. At one point we joked we wanted more bread, and they brought it out and charged us another $5! I hope they take a hard look at what they’re doing here and try a new approach. So sad for this iconic corner.</Review>

Omg we love this place! Been several times for special occasions: NYE, birthdays, anniversaries, Elton John ;) you name it, if we’re in the city celebrating we’re usually having dinner at Abrazo first. We love the rich flavors of the food, the fabulous wine selection, and the Spanish-style cuisine takes us back to our honeymoon in Spain. We always get the grilled Octopus, meatballs and Paella. Also delicious: the chicken, pork tenderloin and lamb shank.
Abrazo is always our go to to impress people, and it never disappoints- in fact, it has become a go-to for friends we introduced to the restaurant to entertain their friends and family!< /review>

<text>So good!  Great food,  great service.  The apps were exceptional and my entree,  Pork Tenderloin, was on point.  We were with a group of 8 and they accommodated us no problem.  The noise level was perfect for casual conversation.  We were unfamiliar with the wines so we asked the waiter for a recommendation, and after a few questions on our tastes we got a great bottle!  Def coming back for a date with the wife.<//text>< pictures>

They haven't been doing Sunday brunch very long but do yourself a favor and check it out! Everything was delicious. Some innovative approaches on the menu, along with delicious things like house made chorizo and lamb bacon, but hearty and satisfying too. A really good blend of fresh flavors with a satisfying brunch concept, with the Spanish overall theme weighing in but not dominating. A great bottle of cava for $40. Really enjoyed every bite and sip and set our Sunday up perfectly.<//review>

<text>Three of us visited this new restaurant tonight. There were so many interesting things on the menu we couldn’t decide what to try so decided to share. We ordered three small plates, a salad, and paella. Every single thing we tried was exciting and delicious. Though this restaurant is taking over the space of a beloved Spanish restaurant, Abrazo is really California/Mediterranean and should not be compared to Zarzuela. Where Zarzuela was homey and familiar, this is surprising and sophisticated.  We will certainly be back and we are happy about this wonderful addition to the neighborhood.</text>< Time>

<Name>brian gates<//Name><Text>Fantastic food and great service!  This is my 5th time here ( once for Sunday brunch). Beautiful, cozy room on Russian Hill ( 2000 Hyde St ). For starters we had the meatballs, beet cured salmon, charred octopus and roasted carrots - all excellent and well portioned.
For our main courses we had the Seafood paella, lamb shank (to die for) and roasted chicken ( best in the City ). Although we were stuffed we couldn't resist 2 desserts. We went with the dulce de leche and the churros, topped off a perfect evening. Chef Micheal Pawlik paid our table a visit and could not have been a more gracious host. If you are in Russian Hill and are looking for a great meal Abrazo is a MUST!</Text><gmap_id>0x808580e8ced2680b:0x101ca8de7ec6d5f8</gmap_id><user>113189058242923568437</user></record></dataset><record>

WOW - what a wonderful experience at this new Russian Hill restaurant in the former location  of Zarzuela. We are so impressed with the wonderful food and the amazing service . From the moment we walked in we loved everything, the classy old world wood tables and  wood ceiling beams and Spanish atmosphere .
The dishes were exceptional- the lamb shank dish was bursting with flavor and the meat falling off the bone . The churros and Icecreaam dessert was WOW and French Press coffee style  a great touch . We look forward to many more dinners at this new charming Russian Hill gem .< /text>

Abrazo is fantastic!  Chef Mike and his crew are amazing! The atmosphere and service make this an excellent spot for date night, or to share a fun evening out with a group of friends. You can’t go wrong. The wine list is fun and unique. You must try the meatballs, croquetas, and octopus to start. The lamb shank and “Pollo con Pisto” are exquisite (for all you that remember Chef Mike from his days at Frascati, nobody makes a better chicken in SF).
A true neighborhood gem! Get there...<//text>

The chicken and jamon croquetas are an excellent second option. The slighty fried vegetables had an amazing roasted red pepper sauce served with them. The steak has a great seasoning rub. Saw the lamb shank on the table next to me and I wanted that too. Bring on the moscatel dessert wine with the vanilla bean ice cream!<//review>< time>

<user>100348713060344474414<//user><name>Rachel Hayes<//name><date>1564632253016</date><Rate>1<//Rate><Text>The management team here is absolutely disgraceful. The shift manager that assisted me today(whose name I will not list starts with an "M")is an example of what is wrong with young people today. Unfortunately the store manager (who was not present)lacks the insight to identify a lack of maturity her employees. I came into the store to return merchandise and the credit card machine would not process my return. My options were to either exchange, come back another day or wait for the IT department to answer the phone to fix the machine.
Apparently this issue has been ongoing and is not yet resolved. This young female handled the situation so poorly with such a disrespectful attitude that I am still in shock. I even attempted to point out to her calmly if she recognized that she was rolling her eyes and appeared to be irritated. She was snappy and had a smart remark for every single question or comment that I made. I asked her if she realized that this was an inconvenience . She said that it was an inconvenience for her as well. Before I left I told her that the disappointing part is that even when I leave she needs to stay on the phone to resolve the problem rather than wait for the next person to come in and experience the same issue. She hung up the phone right in front of me. I will never spend my money here again. Hopefully the ownership of this location specifically will take measures to address management here. I guarantee that they are doing more harm than good. Needless to say my issue is still unresolved, but tomorrow is another day.< /Text>< pictures>

Food was delicious, Mariscos are served fresh and the Molcajete had great variety! 10/10 freshness, spiciness, service. Recommend to anyone that is looking for great tasting Mexican food.< /review>

<rating>2<//rating><text>There was a kid inside making a lot of noise with his skateboard and the TV was super loud on a cable show. This was first and last time I will eat at this place. The Aguas Fresca was good but not for the price of $5.00. The one at the market are cheaper and just as delicious WON'T BE RETURNING OR RECOMMENDING THIS PLACE.< /text>< Pictures>

I've driving past this place for a whole now and finally went in to try it, OMG I FELL IN LOVE. There enchiladas de mole are by far the best I've ever had, the fajitas are tender with so much flavor and their aguan frescas are 🔥 the cucumber/lemon is my favorite so far. I highly highly highly recommend this place. Its DELICIOUS food and just Great service.</review>

They treated us like family and I hope they get treated the same way from our Montebello residents. We  (party  of 8) went for Grandmother's birthday turning 91 and she had a joyful and memorable time, Peter was very attentive and they went as far as to bring the whole family out of the kitchen to sing to our Grandmother las mañanitas with a delicious cheesecake, All in all a great experience and everything you ask for in good service and good food. Thank you guys<//Review><pics>None</pics>< name>

<review>3 stars because the food is always great, but they were extremely slow today. It wasn't that busy compared to other trips I've had to In-N-Out, it took us 45 minutes from arriving to getting our food. It was not a welcome addition to our drive home today. Had I known it would have taken so long, we definitely would not have gone here today.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x80db7e30578e31b7:0xc6f8c6818f9b251d< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

A bit busy at lunch time on a Saturday, but not unusual for In-N-Out. Friendly. A bit slow right now, but worth the wait. If going thru the drive thru, look for the signs stating 'drive thru' with the arrows. You can watch the traffic on the freeway as you wait.</text>

Great service. Drive thru crazy busy. I went inside. A few on line but moved very quickly. Food was great. Came out quickly. Only every other table open for seating because of pandemic. I was glad I'd stopped there. Well worth it.</Review>

1st time I have to say it was not the best. Barely any lettuce and just didn't taste like an in n out burger.  Never ever had an experience  like this taste at any other in n out. It's okay tho sometimes it happens. I will always continue  to visit in n out, just not the temecula one for a while 11pm ish visit<//text>

You raise your prices amid Covid restrictions and you fail to give the correct order twice in one week. Including beverages. This is my fault for trusting you and not taking time to check my order in your drive thru. Everyone should get vaccinated for our health and so we don't give a place like this to many more chances to screw up.</text>

<Review>You can either do the drive-thru to give your order or walk in and order. You cannot eat in the restaurant. There are tables outside where you can sit and eat. I made my order for takeout, but decided I didn't want to eat in my car, so I sat at one of the outside tables to eat. There is no inside seating allowed.

This In 'N' Out Burger gave me exactly what I asked for, a hot and juicy hamburger. when they ask if I want onions, I tell them to put on both fresh and grilled onions. In addition, I asked for a package of their spread that I add to the Burger as I'm eating it. This time I didn't get any cheese.

I also ordered a large Arnold Palmer to drink, which is a combination of iced tea and lemonade, named after the golfer who popularized it.

I was drinking the combination well before it became popular, and we had a name for the mixture that I won't print here. The combination of the lemonade and the iced tea looks like dirty Brown river water, but it tastes good.

Of course, you can't see what it looks like in the In 'N' Out drink cup.<//Review>< pics>

We came in here after a great deal of running around on a Saturday afternoon... As always, they were busy... Although everyone was kind, courteous and helpful... They completely messed up our order... We only ordered two cheeseburgers and two drinks with fries... Not exactly a large nor difficult order... However, they still got our order wrong...</review>

In-N-Out Burger is always the best! Might look like a long line of cars, but it moves quickly! Simple menu, make sure to ask for grilled onions on your burger. Makes it all that much better!!<//Review>

Was craving a burger and it tasted like heaven for what it is, a simple burger but a burger that satisfied my crave for something that would make me cough after eating because it's slowly clogging my veins but damn does it taste good with a sip of Coke
10/10 would recommend and would go again</text>

I grew up in the town next to Baldwin Park, where the original In-N-Out was located. I have always loved the single cheese burger with grilled onions and the crispy fry bites at the bottom of the basket of fries, with pink lemonade, Please. Yum. We have not lived in a state with an In-N-Out for more than 25 years, so we make to the best burger when we travel.< /review>

This store does great if you order their usual...any special order throws them into  Chaos...they just can't get it right
I sat at the window 5 mins watching them pile up 4 orders waiting on mine then they had me pull out front and it was another 5 mins for them to bring it out! Amazing all i ordered was a cheeseburger with catsup and mustard pickle...real difficult ..I guess for them ot was 10 mins in line
5 mins at window 5 mins in front of the store...
It has happened Everytime I go there..just happens to b where I was working both times...this location is off my list..<//Review>

Waited about 30 minutes to order and get my food. I have a crying toddler in the car that needs to eat and nap. I ordered animal style fries and ketchup, yellow peppers. Got my food rushed home , open my bag and find fries with a melted slice of cheese. :( where'd the other stuff go :(<//Review>

Came here for lunch and as usual, every in and out I’ve been to has been super busy. Guess all the hype isn’t just the hype but their food must be as good. And it was! I ordered the double double with animal style fries and it was delicious. The customer service was great and the food came out in a timely manner. The restaurant was super busy but even with all the chaos, it was clean and everyone was friendly. I would have in and out again in the future.<//Text>

Came here for lunch and as usual, every in and out I’ve been to has been super busy. Guess all the hype isn’t just the hype but their food must be as good. And it was! I ordered the double double with animal style fries and it was delicious. The customer service was great and the food came out in a timely manner. The restaurant was super busy but even with all the chaos, it was clean and everyone was friendly. I would have in and out again in the future.<//review>

Service was fast, the location is great as you can see it from freeway.  There wasn't so many people in a Saturday night which was great as we were driving to San Diego.  Prices of course accessible for the good yummy food.<//text>

First time ever at an In-N-Out and the place serves hamburgers, fries and drinks to include shakes. What is remarkable is everything is quite fresh and nothing was greasy or heavy. I loved the fresh burger that seemed to be prepared just when I ordered it and did not seem frozen. The leaf lettuce was crisp and fresh as were the tomatoes and onions. The fries too were well made and fluffy inside. Really good burger place.< /Text>

<review>I've always been a fan of In-N-Out because their shakes have such a signature taste that I cant get enough of! Try their animal style fries only if you're starving though because as soon as it cools the cheese solidifies and turns into a block of cheese, fries, and In-N-Out sauce. Otherwise a good place for friends to hang out eat< /review><username>Alefa J. Afalava</username><Time>1578580833267</Time><resp>None< /resp></record>

There's a reason In-N-Out is a staple of the Californian food culture, and this location lives up to it. While a little smaller than other locations in the area, it has a nice outdoor area which is a valid option even in February thanks to our wonderful weather out here.</text>

<Review>A simple and consistently good California classic. In-N-out may not be flashy food but it never disappoints.  They are also offering free hot chocolates to kids under 12 (who are present) on rainy days,  a super cute promotion! Try animal style fries,  they are my fav <3</Review>< Pics>

<Review>I use to come to this in n out location often but I haven't been for awhile. Still wonderful as it use to be. The drive through line was super long but I went inside and it was super quick. I ordered my food and got it within 15 minutes.  In N out will always by my favorite! Thanks for the wonderful service!

<Text>In and out is such a great place to have a hamburger the menu is so simple cheeseburger hamburger double burgers and fries and shakes.

In and out.  Food always tastes great (though I feel like their meat got thinner and smaller) and customer service is always great.  When we went around 3 PM, it was almost empty and it was nice.  Their bathroom can get some up grades.  They dont have baby changing tables in the bathroom.< /Text>

<Text>This restaurant is always packed! The food is great if you are looking for fast food. You can order the usual hamburger/cheeseburger or if you want to save on carbs, you can order a burger wrapped in lettuce without a bun. Their French fries are great; an order of French fries is fairly large; my husband and I always share one order. There is a Bible verse on the bottom of the fries box. Milk shakes are from real cream and better than any others I've ever had. There are many, many employees working behind the counter; French fries are always fresh!< /Text>< response>

If you are on a low carb diet you can actually order a burger with out feeling like you are throwing out half of it.  They gladly serve you and seem to have no judgement always a pleasant experience<//Text>

Their fries are gluten free, where as other places fries are cooked in the same oil as breaded stuff.  This helps my daughter who has to stay away from gluten.  She orders the protein wrap and fries with no worries.  The burger is cooked on a different grill than the burger buns too.</review>< Rate>

Yummy food.  But wish they would dry the lettuce better before putting in a sandwich.   I had asked for double tomato,  double sauce, i think they thought i said no sauce.   Good thing i could ask for extra packet of sauce.   Wish they would have given me 2 packets,  then everything would have been perfect.  Regardless,  still love in & out.< /Text>

<Review>What's not to love. Great food that is always consistent (I mean come on, they even grill the bread!). Fries are fresh cut there on site; I've always been kind of amazed at the big cutter. Shakes are great and the animal fries are my favorite! Not the healthy choice, but that's a given...

Simple menu, great fastfood, and great customer service!</Review>< pics>

<review>My husband and I have not been to In-Out in a long time and I must say the burgers were as good as we remembered. We dine in and the atmosphere was warm and welcoming. You could tell the staff and management take pride in their restaurant. Staff walking around asking how was the meal, staff constantly wipping down tables and sweeping food off the floor. We enjoyed our meal and the whole In-Out experience. Highly recommend.<//review><Response>None</Response>< Time>

The staff members at this location are consistently friendly.

Their drive thru is fast and efficient, especially with a worker taking orders by the drive thru so the line does not get too hectic.

As per usual, the cheeseburger was just right with the savory meat, crunchy lettuce and fluffy buns! To pair it off with their clean cut fries, made the meal fresh!

We enjoy In N Out, for its quality burgers that always seem to be crafted well with care.<//Review>

<review>I love the hamburger animal style.  The shakes are some of the best I've tasted at a fast food restaurant.  Only issue is that you can be stuck in the lines for 20 minutes or longer.</review>< username>

Reviewed on 2018-11-09

The staff members at this location are consistently friendly.

Their drive thru is fast and efficient, especially with a worker taking orders by the drive thru so the line does not get too hectic.

As per usual, the cheeseburger was just right with the savory meat, crunchy lettuce and fluffy buns! To pair it off with their clean cut fries, made the meal fresh!

We enjoy In N Out, for its quality burgers that always seem to be crafted well with care.<//Text>

In-N-Out is always the best... I do however wish they used cheddar cheese instead of American, I think it would go better with there fresh ingredients, never frozen food porosity... American cheese dosen't melt well, and tastes processed... Chedder is very melty and taste like natural cheese<//text>

you will always receive top notch service at any location. they actually messed up one of our burgers when they forgot the onions. we walked up and they gave them to us on the side which was great. they had zero problems addressing that concern. i hope any future visit is met with that positivity<//Text>

Well,
I must be brutally honest....I haven't been to a In & Out for about a year. I won't name the one my daughter and I received food  poisoning with our order 😟. HOWEVER...
Went on a CBI with the kids & yeah baby my taste buds were revitalize 😁. Grilled cheese with lettuce, tomatoes and grilled onions, French fries and Neapolitan shake, Aaaaaaaaah, so yummy 👍< /text>

<review>Great and fast service as always and the burgers were great. This place is doing something right because I can go to an In-N-Out down the street or 100 miles from my house and I know the people will be awesome and the food will be great. BTW, gotta have the "animal style" burger if you like grilled chopped onions. It is on their secret menu.< /review><user_name>Alan Orther<//user_name></record></dataset><record>

This is the best food when you get off an airplane or are about to get on one. The drive through usually takes about 20 mins or more. There is also a nice park where you watch flights land at LAX. Bring your dog.</text>

<text>The food is always good of course, but the lines are always ridiculous!! I mean if you plan on eating here on your lunch break then think again because It usually takes a good 30 to 40 minutes in the drive thru and that's on a regular day. The menu is basic! Burgers and fries!! That's really all they need to sell and they bank off of that!! My only complaint is that I have to tell them to burn my meat or cook it well done because I've actually had my burger practically bleeding because the meat was so raw! That's just disgusting to me. I know some people like and order it that way, but I'm not one of them!
I can't handle any kind of uncooked meat!!
For a fast food joint In -N-Out Burger might take a long time to get your food but it will be well worth it! I promise! (If you like burgers that is) Lol. 😁👌< /text>< Name>

<Review>Don't know what happened, but we had to wait while others received their orders even though they order after us, only 2 of us. The burgers didn't taste the same,  been a few years since had double double,  just didn't taste right. Should have stopped there, and returned the food,  within 30 minutes of eating, she got bad cramps, and actually got sick. Wont be going back to this location</Review></record>

The burgers didn't taste the same,  been a few years since had double double,  just didn't taste right. Should have stopped there, and returned the food,  within 30 minutes of eating, she got bad cramps, and actually got sick. Wont be going back to this location< /Text>< Pictures>

Who doesn't like a little In-N-Out??  If you don't know this already, get your burger "animal style" and your fries "well done".  Simple perfection!<//Review>

This location is hands down better than the Murrieta, CA location. The food is comprable, but the human and vehicle traffic is so much better here. You can literally wait in line for a good 10 to 15 minutes before you get your order at the Murrieta restaurant. The staff was all friendly very polite and tended to your needs as requested.
This is a great location not just for burgers, but for other restaurants surrounding this spot; especially for those with picky eaters.</Text>

My 1st time here and Wow what a lousy hamburger! Greasy! And that ol saying "Where's The Beef" fit's perfectly! I'm never going to be going here again. I ordered just a single burger with cheese and fries. The fries were the worst I've ever had in My life! Dry and little if any salt! Yuck!</Text>

Great burgers, fries and service. Classic In-n-out. Is it just me, or are the milkshakes at In-n-out not that great?< /review>

Best burgers-in the cleanest environment, served by upstanding young smiling faces.
Paying any more for a burger elsewhere, won't make the food taste any better.</review>

<review>This is just like every In-N-Out you've ever been into.  It's may be a bit older than some but the food is just as good.  If you like a fresh burger made your way then you know what to get.  Don't forget the chopped chillies!< /review>< pictures>

I rarely go to In-N-Out because it's a little far from my home. I sat in the drive through behind the vehicle at the window for more than 15min. When I got my food, it was cold.<//review>

The food is quality and you get way more than you pay for.   They don’t try to be great at everything, just serve an excellent burger.   While my Texas heart will always belong to Whataburger, this place is a close second and I’ll continue to visit this location when I visit.< /Text>< Pics>

This are California's best burgers, but everyone knows that, right?
This location is very good with timing of delivering your order on the drive thru.</review>

If you've ever eaten at In N Out, you know what this place is. If you've never eaten here, give it a try. Specifically try the "Animal Fries" - Ask cashier what it is and they will explain.<//Review>

You know, it's In N Out! The food is fresh, the shakes are extra thick, and the fries must be eaten within 5 minutes of receiving your food or they turn into shards of glass. What's not to love? Animal style your burger and fries to fatten up, or dip your fries into a chocolate shake to freak out your friends. It's a Cali classic.<//review>

<text>Love In-N-Out! Love this store. It's usually clean & tidy,  even when busy.
I LOVE how the young employees are very courteous, friendly, and professional. They look you in the eye and can speak in complete sentences!And they all hustle. Not at ALL like the typical skulking, pissy teenager at most fast food places (or anywhere that young people lurk). I don't know what In-N-Out is doing to their employees 🤔 but... KEEP IT UP!
The quality of burger you get for the same price or LESS than other burger chains is UNMATCHED. *FRESH* crispy lettuce, no soggy tomato slices, decent bun, cheese MELTED on the just-right-burger (not a slapped-on piece of cold cheese that I get at some burger joints. (Yes... I'm looking at YOU, Burger King.) You get your burger  wrapped up all neat & tidy in a wrapper that cuts down my napkin use from 3,000 to 2. Oh... I'm also overly excited over the milkshakes... I can afford to get BOTH a burger AND a shake. (Livin' large!) Great experience every time!<//text>< pics>

In my experience what makes or breaks an In-n-out Burger is the fries. They either have great fries or they don't. Sadly on my last visit I was a bit underwhelmed by the quality of the fries, I think I may have gotten the "bottom of the bucket" but they were a bit soggy and undercooked.<//review>

I have a few things to say about In-N-Out is Great food, Quality ingredients and always fresh. The waiting time is anything but In-N-Out. Still over all it is worth it.<//Review>

For those people who need to reduce their carbo intake, order "protein style". You get the same great burger, but instead of a bun, it's wrapped in lettuce.</Text>

We added an extra burger when we got to the window to pay, and when we drove up to the next window to get our burgers they ended up forgetting the extra burger we added. I should've checked the order before driving off, and I forgot to get it in the boxes rather than the bags so it was harder to see. We couldn't go back so my sister ended up without a burger. :(<//Review>< Pics>

One of only two In-&-out burgers in the immediate area. The other is off Los Alamos Road in nearby Murrieta. Good parking and outdoor seating area. Right off Jefferson avenue in Temecula.<//review>

Same a the other nearby In-N-Out in Murrieta (see my other review), I Iove their cheeseburgers just as much. The only advantage I can think of is that this is that this is closer to the mall. Lines can be long at peak hours but the staff is very nice and that makes up for the wait IMO.<//Text>

< Review>
InNout burgers are good but the meat is very thin and the cost is high in comparison to any other fast food (i.e.
wendys/mcdonals/burgerking/5guys), in addition, the burgers are pretty much the same as 5 guys which is kind of the EAST -InNout.< /Review>

<review>ordered 2 hamburger meals (#3), not sure what happened, but I received incredibly thin patties on both burgers. It was my first time at this location since moving to the area.

(Translated by Google) It was very delicious.
Customers come in constantly in drive-through and in-store.
It is very wonderful to choose cooking methods and toppings.
It was a short distance from the motel, but because at night is a dark sidewalk, it was more convenient to go by car.
Taste and amount also it might be Japanese taste!

(Original)
とってもおいしかったです。
ドライブスルーも店内もひっきりなしにお客様が来てます。
調理方法やトッピングも選べてとても素晴らしいです。
モーテルからすぐの距離でしたが、夜間は真っ暗な歩道なので、車で行った方が便利でした。
味も量も日本人好みかも知れませんね！< /review>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) There is no doubt that they are the best burgers in California, and not only because of their flavor because they are also a local business that you will only find in California and if very few local stores in neighboring states but still retain the flavor of not made by chain or franchise. Without demeriting chains, it's good to support local businesses especially if they're doing it right. By the way you will only find 3 types of burgers and there are no more options, I think that helps them to be good at the one they present.

(Original)
No cabe duda que son las mejores hamburguesas en California, y no sólo por su sabor pues además son un negocio local que solo encontrarás en California y si acaso muy escasos locales en estado vecinos pero siguen conservando el sabor de no hecho por cadena o franquicia. Sin deméritar a las cadenas, es bueno apoyar a los negocios locales especialmente si están haciendo las cosas bien. Por cierto solo encontrarás 3 tipos de hamburguesas y no hay más opciones, creo que eso les ayuda a ser buenos en la que presentan.< /Review>
