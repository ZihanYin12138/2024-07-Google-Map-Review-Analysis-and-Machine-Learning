Bullet Team,

Just wanted to drop you all a quick note about the engine and drivetrain rebuild you completed on my E39 M5 a few weeks ago. The M5 is running beautifully. The combination of all of your work came into focus to result in near perfection.

I made a few observations over the past month:

Jimmy Schuck and Nate Knight – You guys coordinate things beautifully around there. You know when to get people in and how to set delivery timelines and expectations – so your technical team can make them happy. That is not an easy balance to hit. You are car guys, so you understand your customers and you provide extra details to make customers feel special. For example, most people wouldn’t agree to photo document customer jobs - as you did for me. Thank you!

Adam Koch – Your militant attention to detail is overwhelmingly evident in every corner of that engine, engine compartment and drivetrain. Clean but militant? Yes, cleaning the inside of the transmission bell housing qualifies for ocd levels of militant detail. You are sick and I am grateful. At shutdown, it smells like a new engine when I open the hood. Aint no dust, dirt, rodents, oil, road grime to cook up – anywhere. I am so glad you were on my project! Thank you!

Manny Ixtacuy - It’s worth mentioning that you didn’t just “hose off the car”. Outside and inside was spotless. You deep cleaned the floor mats! The car was so clean that if I hadn’t been in the shop bugging you guys every week and witnessing it first hand – I never would have believed the complete engine and drivetrain were ripped out of it! Thank you!

Mickey Miller – I’m not sure what you did. Just kidding! Giving these guys the implements they need and the freedom to work without micro managing them, all the while providing guidance and support when necessary - was impressive to watch. You made it look easy and I know it aint. Ultimately, with all those moving pieces, you delivered what you said you’d deliver, when you said you’d deliver it for the price you said it would cost. Been doing this long? :-) Thank you!

Thanks again Bullet! I highly recommend your team!

Mickey and his team at Bullet figure out a way and really helped me out in a pinch. In addition to fixing my driver side door, he went above and beyond, touching up the minor details and making sure the car was pristine. Their attention to detail is beyond any BMW place I have been to yet.

Been taking my BMW's to Bullet Performance for over 10 years now.  Their work is always consistent with quality, price and service is 2nd to none.  In the past 10 years they have never tried to pressure me into getting unwanted service or try to take advantage of me.  This is the biggest reason I continue to take my BMW's to Bullet Performance, they are 100% honest!</review>

These guys are awesome, down to earth and very professional. Installed Dinan Exhaust on my M2. They went above and beyond to make the fitment perfect since these tend to hang a tad low they made it to where it doesn't do that. Very friendly, they were just as excited as I was. Thank you guys! I found my new shop for life.< /Text>

<review>As always,  the staff at Bullet read the 'service engine soon' indicator for listed codes 5 minutes after I arrived.  After clearing the indicator, they suggested we keep an eye out for a few days to see if the code returned.  If you own a BMW that is off warranty, and you don't take it to Bullet, you are missing out on significant piece of mind!< /review><Time>1600671957220<//Time><Gmap_id>0x80dcdf1ec2e538a9:0xb0fdffe49e55b4df< /Gmap_id>< response>

My steering wheel started making a rattling sound, so I called and spoke with Mickey, who answered the phone before they were officially opened for the day. He said that he probably knew what the problem was and told me to bring the car in and they'd take a look at it before the other cars were started.  Not only did Mickey himself fix it in about 20 minutes, but he didn't even charge me.  These guys are good!<//Text>

<review>Wow. What an amazing experience! I’ve never been to a shop where the staff and owner are just cool af. The owner even comes out and helps his staff! ( btw the chillest dude ever) Big shoutout to the guy with the red rx-7 for just geeking out with me about his car. It’s obvious everyone there knows their craft and for anyone that owns a BMW, this is it... You don’t have to worry anymore Bc they’ve got you.

Thanks again everyone for the quick install and I’ll be back to finish my f32!!!</review>< pics>

<Review>From NJ and needed some quick advice about alignments on my 340i xdrive as the mechanic out by me can’t seem to get my steering wheel straight. Called these guys 8pm eastern time and got someone on phone who was way more knowledgeable than any bmw service advisor. Gave me great info that I can use when I go back to my mechanic so I don’t have to hear him tell me I’m being too picky.....gotta find someone like these guys but out here in NJ..... thx for the advice.... you guys in California are way ahead of us jersey guys.....< /Review>< Pictures>

I had been going to another independent BMW repair for 9 years that I really trusted and was devastated when they merged with another repair shop . I thought I would never find another BMW repair shop that I could trust but I am happy to say I did ! My hairdresser told me about this place and I decided to give them a try. Terri was very nice and made me feel welcome and two months ago I just went to have things checked out after my car stalled in mid-traffic.
Now after more issues and things I have neglected,  I went back the beginning of October and they fixed only what was needed and did it in the time frame they said they would finish . I am so happy !!! Multiple issues were fixed and I feel safe and secure again in my 2000 BMW 328i manual transmission !! I highly recommend this place and wish I had heard about it sooner ! Thank you so so much !</review>

These guys at Bullet have made my life so much easier being I bought a used 2010 BMW 4 years ago. I was referred there by a friend who’s boyfriend no longer works there, but assured me I’d be in the best hands. I’m sick to my stomach with my last experience at the dealership a few weeks ago, but I know I can call these guys tomorrow and they will make sure to take good care of me and not try to BS me. See you Monday!</review>

Best BMW repair shop anywhere.  They are very knowledgeable about BMW.  Their pricing is fair and won't recommend unnecessary repairs.  I trust them and the work they perform.

I had them perform a pre-purchase inspection on a 2012 650I convertible that I was about to buy.  The seller said the car had been regularly maintained and had no problems.  Bullet found oil leaks and leaks in the cooling system.  They also found that the plugs were still original plugs.  Finally they warned me of several potential problems in the future.  All tolled the deferred repairs and maintenance was $6,000.  I ended up not getting the car.</review>

I've been a Bullet customer for nearly 20 years and 3 ///M cars. They did the pre purchase inspection on my first M5. Mickey and his team have always taken care of my cars.< /Text>

<text>My wife and I have been taking our car to Bullet Performance for many years.  They are the best in town and very affordable. They always call with a quote before performing anything to the cars. This way you are never shocked with a price when picking up your carl unlike many other places in town.< /text><GmapID>0x80dcdf1ec2e538a9:0xb0fdffe49e55b4df<//GmapID><pictures>None</pictures><userid>110649526790029264075<//userid><username>Brad Dumont<//username>< Rate>

<pictures>None< /pictures><user>115596829171923383397< /user><Text>Had 100K service done there 3 years ago. They said I needed brakes front and rear, I said I would do them when I got back. Picked it up, paid 880 bucks, and headed to Vegas. The front cowl cover wasn't put back on right, and fell down 20 miles out of Barstow. It kept falling off all the way there and back, because it wasn't screwed back on. I decided to go to another mechanic for the brakes because I was not feeling confident about the shop. The other mechanic said I only needed front brakes and the rear was 60%, I take the car into another shop today, and ask if I need a 120K service. They take a look and tell me the 100K service was not done. Fuel filter wasn't changed and the plugs which I paid top dollar to have installed were not installed, I was still running OEM filter and at least 70K on spark plugs. When I pay for something to be replaced and I find out it hasn't been replaced, that is fraud. With the poor work, being told things needed replacing that didn't, and obviously charging me for a service they never performed, I don't see how anyone could trust taking their car to Bullet. They should change the name to BS Performance. They robbed me of 800 dollars and endangered my life, I could have got in an accident with that cowl cover falling off. Of course they didn't care, it is still messed up to this day.</Text></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>I took in my 2003 BMW 525i to figure out why I was having misfires and they took a look at it including using a scantool for $60 they told me what the issue was which was a crack in the valve cover, which caused the valve cover gasket to fail and a piece of the vacuum hose from the intake boot to the fuel pressure regulator broke off. They were ablle to replace the hose for $20 on top of the $60 diagnosis. Overall I was very happy with their service, they took it in, gave me the answers that I needed, and took care of it very quickly and professionally. I would definitely recommend others to go to Bullet Performance in the future.</review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

< review>
Along Loma Rica road, there's a small cafe that sells Mexican food. There aren't many Mexican restaurants up in the hills, but this gem really answers that craving for the real deal. We had just eaten pizza, so we weren't hungry at the time. But I had been wanting tamales for weeks. Well, we weren't disappointed.  The tamales were full of pork, covered by tasty masa. When we come back up to Oregon House to camp, we'll definitely be back. Try it. What do you have to lose?</review>

El Charrito's is a great addition to this community, with fast service and  friendly owner. There is no indoor dining, only take out at this time. You can call ahead to order and the food is hot when you receive it. Prices are great too. He serves breakfast, lunch and dinner. Closed Sundays and Mondays. I eat here about once a week.</Text>

This is such a great place to eat, on any day you will find the owner and family inside cooking or clearing tables happy to see you and serve you some delicious home cooked style Mexican food. The resturant is cozy and casual.</Review>

I love his salsa verde you can put it on ANYTHING all of the meals are delicious and really reasonably priced. Not only is it the only real mexican food you'll find up here it's the best in my opinion this side of CA Jose is also really nice and does everything himself.<//Text>

I also find great novelty items here that are great for presents or stocking stuffers. I recently found these cool tumblers and bought a whole bunch for Christmas presents! Also found some travel water containers on clearance and grabbed all 8 of them to give away as presents.< /review>< Pics>

How do I love thee, let me count...  Oh!  This is for others to read!  But, it's true - I love this store. I nearly ALWAYS come away with something that's a great value that will make either me or the recipient (if it's a gift) VERY happy. The only reason I didn't make a purchase today was because I had a four-year-old with me that made it difficult to focus on anything but making sure he didn't break anything. Even then we both had fun.<//Text>

Advertised final sale/closeout but prices were far from closeout. Found a few items, stood in long line to pay but cashier allowed someone to cut in line. I complained to no avail. We left.</text>

<Text>We go here a lot because we're still working on decorating our home.   We usually walk out with nothing, because they rarely have anything we like and/or matches what we have.  But, it's always changing, so have to stop in every few weeks to see what there is.  For that, we are grateful to have this store.<//Text>< Pics>

Absolute worst. They’re never consistent with their coffee taste. I’ve seen them add hot water to coffee because they didn’t have enough.</review>

Starbucks has an impossible breakfast sandwich on their menu you now and I love it! Not completely vegan though because there is egg and cheese on it so be careful and aware. 😊👍< /text>

<Text>Very friendly branch with a drive-thru. A bit slow, but everyone is extremely nice. They try hard to make your order right and will go out of their way to fix an order if there is a mistake.

<Text>I do not recommend this Starbucks. They have half of a drink menu available via the app, most everything says the drink is not available at this store. We wait in line, drive up and there is a guy standing outside taking orders for some and not for others. Not sure what the point of this is. He's gawking at women while attempting to aide in taking orders. I would MUCH rather via the normal way at the screen. Anyway, I order my iced drink and it tastes like a pound of sugar so I nicely ask to get a different drink. The same guy from the drive through pops up again and hands me a HOT drink. Why would I want a hot drink when I just traded in an iced beverage in 90 degree weather? Not a good experience at all. I will not be back to this place, that's for sure.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None</Resp><time>1597439248901< /time>< GmapID>

Rude employees who allow aggression and violence on their property. After a confrontation between customers in the drive thru, they just automatically took the loud girls side and didn't actually investigate what happened. They pushed out a loyal paying customer and allowed the instigator to get coffee.</Text>

<review>By far my favorite drive-thru. Although some times the person working the register doesn't move as fast as I would appreciate, especially when I see both my breakfast and drink sitting on the counter. But hey, someone has to remove the mobile order stickers and place them on the bar above the printer.
Suggest to the customer: if you normally budget a 10 minute stop, add an extra 5 for this location.< /review>< UserId.>

I don't really like Starbucks but they always have the friendliest staff and coffee is coffee so I keep coming back. They really are some of the nicest people. I'm not reviewing Starbucks the company, I'm reviewing this singular location. It's also clean and quick with orders. I avoid the drive-thru line and just go inside usually, it's easier.</text>

<Rating>4< /Rating><Pics>None</Pics><Review>This is a newer Starbucks and is located where my favorite Del Taco used to be. It was completely remodeled and is pretty much an overflow from the other Starbucks that's 4 blocks away. Since it was basically gutted and updated, I'm surprised that there aren't many power outlets for patrons to use. Seating is as maximized as it can be, but the 2-3 times I've visited, it still felt like it wasn't enough.
Staff is super friendly and helpful, more personable than other locations, I feel. Food and drink is the expected Starbucks quality. It's an overall nice vibe.<//Review>< time>

My favorite in & out STARBUX -- use it a lot. 95% everything 100%. Other 5 % is rare such as an order won't go thru for pickup on computer or I'll get syrup in a latte when I never do (though rare...despite happening today lol). Two thumbs up regardless of rare mistakes.<//text>

Great Starbucks! Employees are really nice. I was in a bind for a meeting and didn't place my order for 2 Travelers with enough advanced notice, so I called in and Becca took my order by phone and had it ready in 30mins. So, so grateful - Becca rocks!</Review>

<Text>Quick and easy to get to, has a drive-thru for those days when you just don't want to get out of the car. During my experience the staff was super nice and accommodating, one of the drinks wasn't made correctly but they remade it promptly with no issues. That is awesome and thank you for doing it. The seating at this location is fairly big so you shouldn't have a problem bringing a group over to sit down and have a cup of coffee or tea or frappuccino.< /Text>< gmap_id>

<Text>Way too slow at the drive through. Every time I come to this location I spend at least 15 min in the drive through . And by at least I mean a minimum. I just left the location and once given my drinks I could tell they were already melted half way. Apparently according to the tag my drunk was made 9 min before handing them to me. The employee appeared stressed too. Maybe they need more help in there.</Text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

They are pretty quick, have visited drive thru. People are friendly and mostly remember to give you a napkin. Good sandwiches and breakfast. Coffee is ways good and so is the baked goods. I like a chocolate croissant not warmed up to avoid chocolate spills and the croissant is still tasty.< /review>

Store is always filthy. They usually get my order wrong multiple times per visit. There's always a long wait despite nobody in line. They usually hand you part of your order and then 10 minutes later ask if you're still waiting for something. They are good with correcting the mistakes and my order was refunded on one occasion.<//text>

After putting in my mobile order, we sat around with a LONG wait. Finally asked if it was ready - they said no. Drinks keep going out, no names called or updates given despite being right there ... 15 minutes+ later went through the drinks and found my now cold hot drink. When opened - my venti had less in it than a grande would!

Asked them to remake it, and they got annoyed that "its from whipped cream" and "that's normal"... nearly half full?! They finally remade it and did the same thing again. Frustrating and a starbucks we will definitely avoid.<//text>

It's at the top of the list for design, comfort, and service. Everything is clean and neatly arranged. Also the sandwiches and bakery goods are freshly prepared, daily, and they are delicious. And finally, the service is exceptional. The entire barista are thoughtful, courteous,  and respectful. Their smiles and warm words of encouragement usually light up the day. In the area   of quality customer service, they rate "five" stars.
Review update: June 19th 2019. Occasionally I like to commend the places that I frequent for the good works. Today I would  like to bring attention to exceptional workers at this Starbucks. Both hard-working, ambitious, and conscientious to people they serve above and beyond what I would consider excellence. Cameron, who I have observed, always polite and always respectful, went out of his way to deliver drinks to customers at their table. Sarah, whose eyes and smile could light up the world, has memorized customers names I knew exactly what I wanted before I said a word. This Starbucks still ranks highest in my book. The list could go on and on to include Ben and Patty and a few of the others who I don't know their names-- they are all awesome.<//review>

Cute place, but when I went in to get a hot chocolate with hazelnut, Chelsea asked if we wanted mocha in that, which was confusing. When we got our drinks, the labels didn't say hot chocolate anywhere on them, and it tasted like hazelnut in milk. Not bad, but not what we ordered.<//Text>

This review is more for Lanie the barista than it is about Starbucks. I go to Starbucks because I know what to expect everyday- and it's generally perfect. If the coffee shop itself requires a specific review (ie: cleanliness, service, speed) I'll usually speak up. This store is brand new. I've never been before- it's quite nice, bright and clean. But one thing sticks out. Lanie. A good morning to EVERY SINGLE PERSON that walks in the door. She makes drinks, while effortlessly checking in with each person- BY NAME- to let you know your drink is on it's way. Also, "good mornings", "have a great day", and "see yas!" can be heard across the store. What a refreshing experience. Thank you, Lanie for a fabulous start to my day. After fighting traffic to get here- you're a breath of fresh air. Faith in humanity restored. Corporate- are you listening?</text>

< review>
I pulled up in the drive-thru to pay for my drink and handed the employee, a sneering, rude, man named Sam my card. Sam meant to punish me because I wasnt a parade of smiles for his overly-enthused and fake retail personality. He asked me what I had ordered. I told him. He smiled and said, "I figured....just wanted to make you say it, tee hee!" At that point I grew angry and demanded my credit card back which he didnt seem prepared to do unless I played his little game. I'm sorry but if youre going to bully customers for your emotional succor and get your rocks off that way, you haven't any business working in food or retail. I sincerely hope the manager of this location fires this completely petty and mean-spirited Sam.<//review>

My wife goes here and they do a great job. She gets in and out quickly and the price is just right. The owner has passion and enjoys her business. My wife says it hurts but she also says beauty is pain. Will continue to give them our business<//review>

Great attention to detail. I'm always happy with the results. My only suggestion is to get more threaders as there is usually a significant wait time.<//review>

<time>1534552547275<//time><Text>Spare yourself the pain, cuts and botch!!! Horrible service and my eyebrows are ruined. My ending result was my eyebrows ending so far up my eye they look ridiculous. Your eyebrows should arch around the eye, and mine clearly does not. I now have to draw them on to make them look semi complete. I went in with 3 months of growth to be botched. The girl who started my eyebrows “didn’t feel good” and was stepping away coughing throughout service until she passed the thread to another worker there and she finished.

There are also cuts where they “threaded”. Looks like uneven, short eyebrows and cuts are going to be my look until it grows out and heals.

Absolutely horrible and I wouldn’t wish their service upon anyone.< /Text>< resp>

Good place. Sometimes the eyebrows aren't even, but it depends on who does them. Regardless, this is still the only place my daughter comes to for her eyebrows.</text>

We are in love with the girls specially Daisy. I have never been to a pedicure where all the girls are so attentive to you. I had Daisy and she got the ingrown nails out of my toes. The gel nails on my toes are always the best specially when I tell them surprise me with the colors. Best place ever I even made appointment for my dad and he stated they didn’t make him feel weird.< /Text>

<review>Absolutely loved my experience here. Very friendly welcome into their salon. They take precautions seriously by taking your temperature and making sure you sanitize before entry. They have a very large selection of colors (which was my favorite). Definitely found my new nail salon to go to.

was super excited to try this place, but I’m super disappointed. when I made my appointment I was told it would be $40 and 30 minutes long….well over an hour and $60 dollars later I had crooked nails, a poorly done design on each of my ring fingers, glue I had to peel off left on my fingers, and my nails hurt really bad, probably due to the cuts left on my cuticles. everyone there was super nice, but if I’m going to sit for over an hour and pay $60, I want my nails to look and feel amazing. likely won’t return :(</Text>

And you wanted to had gel on the acrylic set then it is $20 extra with the longer nail and the design on your ring finger.\nPlease feel free reach out to our salon manager with any further comments, concerns, or suggestions you wish to share.

I would give them more stars if I could! Nia and her staff are amazing! They are very clean, meticulous & use good products! Both my daughters and I have been going since she opened and our nails have never looked better!
I have acrylics - they’re always shaped perfect and I never have any problems with lifting in between fills! My daughter gets gel manicures & pedicures and that lasts great as well!< /Review>

Covid compliant! Very clean and I felt safe as they spread customers out, took temps, and had many layers of sanitation practices. Great services and awesome massages with pedicures.</Text>

Amazing pedicure that I have ever. "Hot stone, foot roller, sugar scrub, and Parafin". really high technology, very clean, a lot of color to pick. come and check in to get 5% off reward when you sign up to become loyalty customer. You can use that reward when ever you want, they just keep add it up in your profile.<//review>

I've been coming to this location for years(since it is down the street from my house) and with the new ownership I was a bit scared. But let me tell you this place is great! The new owners and so nice and friendly. She remodeled the location and it looks beautiful inside now. The new products work great too! I never feel rushed when I come in which is always a great bonus.I loved this place before and I still love it under the new ownership now!< /Review>

They are extremely nice and I love the remodel. Several times my nails have chipped or peeled the next day. I switched to basic polish and this time you could see the color was uneven. They are always willing to fix it, but I’m very busy and it’s a big inconvenience. I’d much rather go somewhere that does it correctly the first time.</Text>

Let me tell you! I am SO GLAD I tried this place out! We just moved to a place, which is around 25 minutes from Crystal Nail Spa. I am a bit of a germaphobe and VERY particular about my mania and pedis. I need a clean place, talented nail tech & great service. That’s it! It’s been a struggle to find anyone since moving to CA, who I felt, met my standards, without charging $100+ for a basic dip or gel manicure, which still was never quite right! (Crazy) Which is why I went to Google & Yelp to seek out a new place! They offer online scheduling, customer rewards program, and delicious coffee, tea, etc...Nia, Ryan & Tin were all just amazing! Best manicure I’ve had in California so far! (5yrs Of searching) Waxing services ++ also! If you haven’t visited yet, I highly recommend! Great location, fair prices & outstanding service! I have found my new salon! Tell everyone you know! I know I will!<//text>

<Review>Very expensive place, paid $70 for plain gel manicure and regular pedicure. And just as I was pulling out my credit card to pay, they strongly suggested I pay by cash which was strange.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>{'time': 1580697120301, 'text': "Thank you for your honest review.

<review>Phones don't work extremely well, but the customer service is ideal and generally quick. Although, I do recommend that you make sure you have enough time if you need to go here on a busy day, as something the store can get very busy depending on foot traffic.<//review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPYqCJkmfJ_PhXRPjD_0ICp19YIY5GfznilROmC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><response>None</response>< GmapID>

<username>Ivette R.</username><Review>I was there about an hour. I came in with a broken phone clearly needing a new one. All she did was hover around me awkwardly watching me play. She didn't bother telling me much about the phones I was looking at or asked me any questions about what I was looking for. In the end I took nothing because the upgrade few is waved online and they wouldn't do it in store. Seems like they didn't care for business.<//Review>< date>

Today i called about 4 BARBER SHOPS and all wanted me to make an appointment or they had a full book RIDICULOUS. Back to the 5 star man from FADE KINGS perfect name for this establishment. DIDNT CATCH HIS NAME but he was very respectful and patient. I didnt hesitate to reward this talented barber with a $12 TIP. Despite 6 poeple ahead of me w/no appointment I only sat there for about 15mins and i was getting a fade. Thanks Again ill be back.<//Text>

First time going and I went with the barber that is stationed second to last from left to right. I asked for a medium skin fade, beard & line up. Highly unsatisfied with the outcome. Barber went to high and took off the back portion of my hair that I would comb back. Barber also gave me uneven sides. Two stars because my beard was at least good and I can hide the haircut with a hat.<//review>

The guy was in a rush... And it showed. I am willing to pay more for a better cut. If you are in a hurry and trying to save money this is the place according to my experience.</Review>

Horrible. Drove about a 1/2 hour and as I was walking in a barber comes out and says we are closing early cause they were short a few barbers smh. If you advertise your open until 6 you should keep your word or.......expect to continue to get bad reviews like so. FYI this was my first ATTEMPT here and won't try ever again.< /Text>

<Text>The atmosphere was relaxing, the servers were very friendly, the food came out quickly and the amount of food was great as well as the price.
The plate I had was about $10 and it was plenty of food!
Overall wonderful dining experience, would definitely come again.!< /Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMCAPtXBhQE4imMg3WrzVUsHZQTcmg1u7gUotDJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNNlxj2ryqmh7rLaMy8nHJ3letUAmCZr_OdPBL8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< response>

<rating>5< /rating><review>Sweet Basil is one of my favorite restaurants in Norco, it feels like my second home. The staff are so friendly and everything is always right. I have never had a bad experience here. I’ve tried a few things here but usually get the same thing. To my surprise one of the owners remembered what I had last time and have since remembered every single time I come in. I wish I could give more than five stars because this place really deserves it. I would recommend this place to anyone.<//review>< pics>

A real favorite restaurant for me. Generous portions. Great service. Almost always a spare table even at busy times. My Bible Study often comes here after class. A real favorite.<//review>

I read many of their reviews on Yelp and they were right. I ordered the tiger steak dish and it looks like it had been cooked prior. So the meat was extra hard and overly done. They do not know how to make good fried rice and they are missing one of the best hot sauces.< /text>

<Text>Very, very impressed. Food was outstanding. I HATE curry but ordered Pineapple Fried Rice which has curry in it and ate half the plate. Orange chicken was supper light and just has a super fresh taste. Recommend, the clear noodles. Can't wait to go again I already know what I want to try next.

We have been here many times, and it is consistently good every single time. The coconut soup is such a unique flavor and full of meat. It's a meal by itself. The owner and staff are always friendly. It's an easy place to go for dinner whether you want to eat fast or take your time.< /Text>

The food was good. The service was good, but not great. We had a large group, and we wanted to sit together. The server would not let us push the 2 smaller table together so that we could sit with everyone in our group.  We had 2 spaces  in between 4 tables.  We wanted to sit at 2 larger tables instead of 4 smaller tables.  The server thought it would inconvenient for her to pass the food over to the opposite side of the table. We didn't mind. We wanted to sit together. We didn't mind the inconvenience. We knew that we would have to help pass the food over to the other side. Usually restaurants are more accommodating with larger groups.<//Text>

However once you get acquainted with the flavor it becomes unique taste and quite good! Or perhaps my taste has just changed since I am not dieting.</review>< pics>

Sweet Basil is hands down one of the best grub spots in Norco. Consistent quality, amazing dishes with a mellow atmosphere and tremendous customer service. Delicious, traditional Thai food. Try the linguini with green curry, you won't be disappointed.</review>

Cozy atmosphere, generous portions of fragrant Thai flavor. Good service and a mixture of traditional and Asian fusion style dishes. Priced so you come often.< /Text>

Its kind of a "hole- in- the- wall" restaurant with limited seating. Kind of small and intimate. Great food! That Pad Thai though< /text>

We LOVE this place.  The only bad part is trying to decide WHICH delicious entrée to order, because I love my faves but wanna try new also! Staff is always friendly and will help you choose if you aren't familiar with Thai food. I can't wait to try their new location!!<//Review>

It is very good food and almost everything on the menu is under $10. They are always busy and are opening another Thai Basil in Corona next to the courthouse on 6th.  The service is excellent and they cater to you a lot if get to know you. It is all family in there as waiters, cooks and waitresses. Very good and delicious food. You can get very hot or very mild depending on your taste and desire. There are four pepper dressing condiments at every table. Their tea is even good there.<//text>

<review>since I walked in I felt a very bad vibe from this lady I didn't like it she made me feel very uncomfortable she was staring at me and asking me where I was from I told her I'm latin  and she said that I look Asian and my husband took me there one time and I really love their food but I really didn't like the lady's Vibes. Very bad service I don't look Asian.. to me she was racist cuz all her clients are white.. what's going on now even the Asians don't like brown skin.. I bet  her cooker it's latino... I'm sorry I am not asian I don't look Asian and I just look so Latina something was wrong with her.. she asked me what country and I answer her and she was  giving me the attitude.. so to me she was a racist Thailand woman dont forget you are immigrant  it not your business  to ask were I live and were I'm from</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

<text>Thai iced coffee was horrible! !!! Changed it in for tea which was just ok. Pad thai was really nice ,the pad su ew was tasteless no flavor at all. My steamed mussels were over cooked. I sat by the front door and the dust that was next to me was gross! !!!!!!!<//text>< time>

<Text>Fair Thai food for a Vegetarian, not the best. Only Tofu options and I felt like there was contamination with meat. The guy was sitting making won tons and eating at the same time. Hard to watch someone put their hand in their mouth then make my won ton.<//Text><pics>None</pics>< response>

<text>The western burger: buns and patty were okay, bacon and onion rings were great. Loved the BBQ sauce on it.

The super double burger: buns and patties were okay, toppings and sauces were great.

* They could really upgrade the buns and patties!

Regular fries and zucchini fries were great with ranch. First sauce free then forty cents each additional.

Would recommend for a quick bargain bite to eat, may go again but not top choice of burger joints.< /text><Rate>4<//Rate><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNspqkybAzF2Ojidl8XqlCEqBXeikTeBNus9HE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMo3nXkFSADVPwa_JIXZZpV2a-3fWl7BD9ysp4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics></record></dataset><record>

Highly recommend the western burger and the friend zucchini. They have the good kind of ranch, too.</review>< Pictures>

They have great seasoned crinkle fries. The food came out nice and warm which was good. I got the Super Burger which had a good flavor. The staff was friendly through the drive thru. They have several selections to choose from. For a fast food burger place they are good. Would definitely go here over a burger king or jack in the box if they were closer to me. I wouldnt drive out of my way unless i had a taste for their fries. They toast the buns which is always a good play for a burger and the cheese was nice and melty the way In n Out does it. Reminds me of Flame It burger down on the south end of Chestnut.

Now that I'm typing the reviews it makes me want to try again so i will do that and potentially up the rating. They werent bad at all. Frozen patties but a good burger. If you are looking for something different it's worth a try with a decent variation of menu items. I took a few pics to help.<//Text>

<review>If you like good old burgers and fries with milkshakes, then this place will be your spot. The employees are extremely nice, and the food is very good quality. I have been there more than 10 times and get the same quality food and service every time. Menu prices are in line or better than all of the large chain burger joints, but the food is way better than the big chains.</review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

One of the best places in fresno and Clovis to eat good higher quality fast food. Everything on menu is really good but my fav are the soft serve and the grilled chicken sandwich I've tried everything from salads to burgers and they are very good but I get the grilled chicken sandwich because it's light juicy flavorful and fresh as all hell and u don't feel like a fat fk after unless u get friend and milk shake lol then I get the itus. The chicken meal was bomb af too . Burger are good but I make better burgers at home.< /review>

<review>Save your money!!!! My friend wanted to try this place since it for some reason has good reviews (must be owners friends and employees).  The fries were too salty, the onion rings were just oily and no taste. I had the #11 combo the Super Burger with Bacon.  The burger had no taste, a very thin patty. There is just nothing super about this place. I'm sticking to Triangle Drive In and Bulldog Burger Bistro for my burgers. My poor friend is still suffering from heartburn. I really should have kept going...just the looks of this place is not appetizing. The building looks dirty and the parking lot is filthy.<//review>< Name>

<Review>My family and I have been here twice. First time we ordered the chicken dinner, bacon double cheese burger, and 2 hamburgers. Everything is good. The chicken dinner had the best fried chicken, it was really crispy and seasoned. The second time we ordered 2 corn dogs, 1 Strawberry milk shake, banana split and 2 chocolate/vanilla ice cream cones. The corn dog, banana spilt, and the ice cream cones are huge especially for the low price. Great customer service, very nice people, fast, and food is good at a low price. Please check them out, this place is awesome! :)<//Review>< pictures>

Decent food, really good for a drive-thru/fast food. The burgers are on par with Sonic or Whataburger. The "Super Sauce" is a mayo/mustard mix. I wasn't a big fan because I don't like mustard. But I could see it being a treat. They will grill your onions for your burger on request and that was super yummy. The fries are crinkle cut like Del Taco and seasoned with seasoning salt like Red Robin.
The chicken strips are mediocre. There is almost more batter than chicken and need sauce. The ranch dipping sauce is tasty, so don't forget that or ketchup. And they have that great small, slushy style ice like Sonic has, that kind is great for chewing.
Over all a good meal when you need a fast simple meal.< /Text>

<Review>Oh man first review. yeeeyeee. The portion size is big. The chicken strips are good but not the best (they just need some more flavoring). The wait time was like 5 minutes but it was made to order. It was fresh and was not cold when we got it. We will come back for shakes. Not a bad place at all. 👍👍👍
Update. We went again for shakes (i was excited to try it) but they didnt make them the way we wanted them. We asked for have vanilla and half chocolate but they only gave us chocolate. The shakes were okay. Just make sure you verify the order with them.<//Review><Resp>None</Resp></record>

Disappointed with the low quality food. The boston shake was just soft-serve; wasn't even ice cream. I think the chicken sandwich was just a frozen patty deepfried (it had zero taste).<//Text>

Got Super Buger Bacon and cheese combo. The burger patty was significantly smaller then the bun so it was like eating bun. The fries we so salty it was like the salt flats in my mouth after two fries. I paid an extra .30 for ranch but never got it. The sprite was watery. I am very disappointed.<//text>

My family and I received our covid vaccinations at Centinela hospital. As physicians, my husband and I were very impressed with the organization, professionalism, and the kindness of the staff. It feels more like a family when you walk in. Everyone was helpful and polite. Even the gardener greeted us !
The staff were competent and compassionate. Melba was not only gracious but oversaw much of the process. She is a super star!From check in to check out the whole process ran smoothly. Dr. Patel, the other doctors, nurses and entire staff should be very proud of their contribution to jumping into action when the vaccines first became available. It was seamless for patients. We are immensely grateful.<//review>

If you need your Covid vaccination or any medical assistance, Centinela Hospital Medical Center is your place! The staff is absolutely wonderful and so caring. They genuinely care about you. Melba went above and beyond when I had to leave the state for work and wouldn’t be able to return to Centinela Hospital to receive my second dose. She not only mailed me my vaccination card, but sent me a picture of it as well so I could get my second dose while in Texas. If you’re looking for an efficient medical center with an amazing group of people as the staff, don’t look any further! Go to Centinela Hospital Medical Center now!</Review>

My husband and I were lucky enough to receive our Covid vaccination here.  We were so relieved not only to get the vaccination, but to be treated with such care and respect.  We felt safe and were greeted with warmth.  We didn't have to wait and there were no lines upon arrival.  The nurses explained everything and treated us with dignity. And it didn't hurt!  It was also pretty great that parking was a breeze!  I feel so fortunate to have had such a positive experience!< /review>

The most amazing staff I’ve ever experienced!! The establishment is clean and feels safe. The nurses, front desk person to security to the check in person are all so kind and sweet! They made me happy and smile! I got my shot and it didn’t hurt at all. Everybody is so professional and great at their job. They made the vaccination process an amazing experience!</text>

I went to Centinela Hospital Medical Center to get my covid vaccinations and it was quick and easy! I just had to show them my id and health insurance card when I got there. I went straight into the vaccination room and got my shots within minutes. Waited for 15 min after my shots and that was it!</Review>

I had the privilege of getting the vaccine here at Centinela Hospital where I received amazing care by all their staff. Personally, I would like to thank Melba and Oscar for taking their time out of their day to ensure safety and great medical care. In such scary times, I felt safe and confident under their presence. 🙏🏽 Thank you so much!</text>

<Text>I heard horror stories from friends and families who experienced other vaccination sites so I was pleasantly surprised by the organization and efficiency of the staff at Centinela Hospital. The entire process took about 30 minutes and parking was conveniently located adjacent to the building. I highly recommend Centinela Hospital to those looking for a quick, easy, and safe vaccination site for themselves or loved ones. Special shout out to Melba for being especially helpful and empathetic during the process.< /Text>< name>

< Review>
I was never a fan of this hospital until August 26, 2019 wherein we were told I had to give birth at just 28 weeks gestation. Our baby girl was delivered at Centinela and weighed just 1lb 6oz. It was such a difficult time filled with unmitigated terror. However, over the course of 5 months this became our second home and the lovely NICU staff our second family. For five months my partner and I would visit this hospital daily, sometimes twice in one day to visit our LO. The staff was always very informative and tried to make us feel as comfortable as they could. I am so grateful my LO was under their care and wouldn’t want to have it any other way. I would highly recommend this hospital.</Review>

Got both my covid shots here--the staff are so nice and patient! Didn't feel the needle at all for both shots, and I'm usually a baby about these things.

No line either for the shots, which was a plus ☺️< /Text>

Came to get my covid shot and was brought in right away. Great friendly staff, helpful, and speedy. Highly recommend for covid shot. I recommend off street parking though because you will have to pay for parking inside clinic lot and no validation.<//Text>

Getting the covid vaccine was a smooth process at Centinela. There was only 2 two people in line. No pain what's so ever when I recieved the vaccine. Total time for the whole process was about 30min.The medical staff was awesome, starting from the front desk to finish.< /Text>

I recently had my COVID shot with my wife and another family member. The experience was great and the overall process from beginning to end was seamless and encouraging for other to take their COVID shots. Thank you Melba Giraldo for organizing this event and helping to get your local city’s and county closer to normal.< /Review>

It was a little confusing to find the right building for the Covid vaccine, I ended up parking really far and walking to 3 different buildings before I found the right one. Once inside, the process to sign in was quick and the lady who gave me the vaccine did a great job! I didn't even feel the needle!!!< /Text>

<Review>Came here for my Pfizer Covid vaccine and everything was easy, smooth and pain free. I was hesitant at first to get the vaccine but realized that Covid isn’t new so they have probably been working on this for a while just not for this variant. Either way, I have mine and it was simple thanks to Centinela.</Review>< pics>

The four star review is for the vaccine center, with appointment -- clear directional signs made it very efficient, no wait time, front desk staff courteous and amiable, nurse who gave my shot informative and caring.  They did a great job in making sure not one area was overcrowded. I took off one star because of an inattentive guard outside the office door on my way out and the $8.00 parking fee (yikes) for about 30 minutes.<//Text>

Had a wonderful experience getting vaccinated here. Felt very safe, never too crowded and was quick to get in and out: a wait of maybe 5 minutes, get the vaccine, wait 15 minutes and all done. Great nurses administering the vaccines as well. Would 100% recommend.< /text>

So fast, so nice, and so quick! Got my 1st and 2nd dose of the Covid vaccine here. Took no longer than 20 minutes for my 2nd dose. 1st dose takes a bit longer due to the paper work, but still very quick. Definetly a great spot to get vaccinated.</Review>

I had a good experience getting the Pfizer vaccine at Centinela Hospital. There were only a few people waiting when I arrived and the shot was painless. I had to stay in a waiting room for 15 minutes afterwards to make sure there wasn’t an adverse effect and then they gave me an appointment card for 3 weeks later. Much smoother than I originally anticipated considering what you hear on the news.<//text>

I got my Covid 19 vaccine shots at Centinela. They were incredibly organized and kind when I came in. I was impressed by the security and efficiency for the whole process. After I received my vaccine, I felt comfortable in the way the made sure I didnt have a reaction before I left for the day.
Special shout out to Eric Chew for being so helpful on organizing the appointments for me he even helped me with parking! Such great customer service. I would choose Centinela over any hospital on every day!< /review>

ALL the staff was wonderful & very thorough.

Throughout the years I have been to other emergency rooms including UCLA Santa Monica & it was o.k.
This one by far exceeded my expectations. They were prompt, attentive & didn't try to offer minimal care like some emergency rooms. They were quick to recognize the health issues & do the right tests.

For anyone reading this. This hospital will kill your loved one. Please take them somewhere else. This hospital should be closed down. Everyone there is rude. You don’t really know what goes on in there. Take them to Torrance hospital if you have the chance to. If you live near the hospital it’s best if you take your loved one somewhere else because the ambulance will take them directly to Centinela. You’ll thank me later.</text>

We received our COVID-19 shots here.  On both visits, once  we were in the door, we spent less than 25 minutes, including a 15 minute post-injection observation period.  Everybody from the front door monitors to the nurses administering the shots to the women who checked us out at the end was professional, kind and efficient.  Many thanks!<//text>

I had the best experience getting covid vaccine here. It was very well organized from beginning to end. Melba was there and said hello to everyone. She is friendly and has a warm smile. She was approached if anyone had any questions or concerns. There was  staff and signs directing us to the covid 19 vaccine location. Everyone was very nice and helpful. The room is well set up with a sitting area to wait 15 mins after vaccine. I was in and out in less than 1/2 hr. I would definitely go again.</Review>

<text>I received the COVID (Pfizer) vaccine at CHMC. The recess was efficient, smooth & well organized from check in to vaccination  & observation. The nurse giving the shot was friendly & reassuring and it was aimless. I had no significant reaction to either shot except a little soreness of the arm: same as after flu shot. Melba deserves kudos for her very
thorough and cooperative attitude in arranging the appointments.She helped my 2 adult children & their spouses get the much needed vaccine. She is a Superstar and deserves to be named CHMC Employee of the Month!<//text>< Pics>

The staff is so wonderful, especially Melba Giraldo. She is so helpful and welcoming, she assisted me in all my questions and made sure me and my family felt comfortable and well taken care of. She has such a good professional and positive personality, once our appt was completed she checked on me and my family she made sure we didn’t have any more questions and made sure we had a follow up appt. I look forward for my next appt, thank you again everyone at Centinela and Melba for making me and my family feel so welcomed and thank you all for taking such good care of us.<//review>

The COVID vaccination process was efficient and professional.  I particularly commend the hospital for having a good appointment standby process so that vaccine which had a very short shelf life once opened was not wasted.</Review>

Kimesha Green is the best trainer. She trained me and she was very nice and understanding, she explained everything to me and she did it with a smile. She had no problem answering any of my questions and she’s very professional. I highly recommend her to any new employee🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟< /text>

My family and I had a recent wonderful and  fortunate experience of receiving our 1st and 2nd COVID-19 Pfizer vaccinations at Centinela Medical Center.     Considering it was still a vaccination/injection, the experience we had was quite painless, enjoyable and as pleasant as it could possibly be. The staff are extremely friendly , compassionate , kind, organized/efficient, talented  and very committed in healthcare .    The love and passion for their profession is clear!     To the front line/essential workers to the upper echelon/management , we thank you from the bottom of our hearts for your exemplary services and keeping our family safe and comfortable during  the peaks of this COVID-19 pandemic.      Thank you for all you have done for our community in Southern California and beyond.    Eric Chew PA-C and family.</Text>

With the covid 19 restrictions this hospital has gotten worse! God forbid you go to the emergency room! Security is lazy and incompetent! No help at all trying to find loved ones, they sit in a tent and twiddle their thumbs playing on their cell phones. Heed this warning! If you can help it request to go somewhere else!</Review>

As you noted, LA County remains in the purple tier or Tier 1, which is widespread for COVID-19 infections. Therefore, the hospital must continue its visitor restrictions during this time for your safety and the safety of others.  This is incredibly difficult for patients and their loved ones. Your feedback on not being able to get help finding loved ones has been noted and forwarded to the responsible departments to improve our customer service. Again, our team apologizes if we added to this challenging situation. Thank you.'}<//Response>

My opinion of this hospital is up and down. I had a ruptured cyst the first time and was given a shot of pain medicine and discharged. But the second time I had a ruptured cyst and bad bladder infection not only was I given ultrasounds I was also given morphine and Norco for the pain and did everything to keep me comfortable and keep the pain down. Very good. Then the last time I had what I thought was food poisoning was sent straight to the tent right away because my "symptoms" presented as possible covid (blame the EMTs mainly for this) but once I explained again that I go nowhere and 98% isolate and that I know it is food related, turns out the doctor thought food related as well and was given zofran and pepcid but then discharged where I proceeded to expel everything and passed out several times but was afraid to go back thinking they may just discharge me again, when I could save myself a wasted trip. So it's a love hate relationship with this hospital.</text>

This review is of the facility and hospital staff when you are there for other care outside of the Emergency Room.

I was very impressed with both their safety protocols upon entering the hospital building, the staff there to help direct you, as well as the staff in general admitting you and processing you for whatever reason you are there.

Had surgery there very recently, and with all the bad experiences I've heard of people having here in the past, I was prepared to lower my expectations and figured I would be in and out and let that be that. However I had a wonderful experience with the nurses and staff there. Everyone was so very attentive and caring and amazing, and I'm so very grateful.

I haven't used their ER in some time, and the last time I was there, half of them were fairly useless, the nurse even going against the proposed care plan the doctor had ordered for me, and another nurse fortunately attended to me (was dealing with necrotic tissue and a fever -- not good). However that was quite some years ago, and I do think they've turned things around since then. I'm happy to see the local community hospital is thriving and that our community can expect great medical care when needed.</review>

The staff and security really need to know how to talk with people.  They are so rude.  The doctor comes out of the tent yelling saying yall got to go and the security guard comes over and says if my child isn't a minor I can't be with her.  Since she has some serious issues, I decided to walk away so I wouldn't get arrested.  Got to hire some better people!!!!

If the staff can not deal with the public, they need to find better jobs.  Just because there is a pandemic, that doesn't give you the excuse to be rude.< /review>

<Text>Honestly I came with my husband to the hospital earlier this year and I have cancer so I looked horrible and smelled horrible a brave security man with long braids was trying to help me but couldn’t understand me and a beautiful mixed gal  nurse named destiny in the Emergency Room helped me out she made me feel like I was going to be ok she hugged me she prayed for me never do I see someone that’s as genuine like her bless her soul. I came few weeks ago because I was having trouble breathing and the staff very tired seemed annoyed. I asked my nurse Brenda about destiny and found out she no longer worked there but point is this is a regular hospital trying to help people and through covid all places are busy busy. Didn’t like the wait time< /Text><userid>114667563419806747626<//userid><date>1609432184956< /date>< rating>

Who ever is answering the hospital phone or ER and Operator does not know how to put a call on hold. She hangs up everytime. Everytime! Please teach your staff how to put a call on hold and transfer calls properly. Ridiculous.</Text>

Oh my God!! This place was horrifying! Absolutely no structure, completely understaffed , they had one nurse to check temperatures and then triage us! I left before i even got triaged!
First, in the crammed waiting room, there was an extremely sick  woman vomiting every 5-10 minutes! there was vomit everywhere!  i go in the bathroom and there was vomit all over the floor, voimt bags everywhere! i couldnt use the bathroom! Where is housekeeping? what about simple sanitation at a hospital?!
The rest of the people were huddled together close in groups, some with no mask! What gets me, is, the sick lady  should have been taken straight to a bed! she should have came by ambulance!
that leads me to the ambulance bay! the paramedics had a man outside in the cold  on a gurney for. the entire  time I was there, almost 2 hours as i was looking for my  friend who accidentally went to the covid tent! She said the staff were talking about all of the covid deaths in front of covid patients. all in all, it was frightening, i left before i even had my name in the system.<//review>

<Text>I was bleeding after motorcycle accident.. literally my blood was dripping on the floor, they did nothing at all, AT ALL! I kept begging them to treat me. After like 10 hours of waiting they barely treat my injuries. I swear I literally waited for the doctor to come see me 55 hours!!!!!! They got zero humanity!! The doctor visited me on the fourth day which is last day.... I swear I'm not lying. Save ur life and go somewhere else! This place is not a hospital!< /Text><Time>1600280094844</Time><Pics>None</Pics>< gmapID>

This hospital is the reason my father died. If the nurses were rude to me on the phone I wonder how they treated my dad when he was there. Shame on you. I also called because I’m missing some of my fathers belongings and they said they would give me a call back and they never returned the call. Totally unprofessional. My dad should of went to Torrance hospital instead!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<//Review>

This unprofessional blk lady with blonde hair went above and beyond to let me know she has no interest in doing anything for. I told her i was in pain and had trouble breathing she in return said WELL DONT. I asked for a sanitary and help with my sheets. She in return said I HAVE TO GIVE YALL BACK TO YOUR NURSE. The way she speaks is horrible how is it ok to express no empathy as i bleed on a mattress like this photos are to follow< /Text>< resp>

I have a disease that causes a brain malformation with epilepsy and heart disease. I was sitting in bed at home when I had what felt like a heart attack followed by several severe grand mal seizures. I was taken here by ambulance. They put the seizure pads on my bed rails but did not give me a call button and left me alone in the room for hours. They did a chest X-ray and said I was fine and I asked to be discharged ASAP because I did not feel safe there (they should be watching someone who just had a ton of seizures and they should’ve taken my chest pain seriously). So then I was waiting for a long time for discharge papers when I had an even more severe seizure. Thankfully there was another patient in the room at that time who yelled for help or they wouldn’t have even noticed. Only then did they pay attention and give me the medication I needed and actually look at my binder that explains my condition (it’s rare so I need to explain it to most doctors). I was then admitted to the hospital for the next few days. I don’t really remember anything from the first day after the seizure but I do know that the cardiology unit was a little nicer than the ER. They ran a bunch of tests but found nothing wrong with me. A week ago I had an enlarged aorta (found at another hospital) and the doctor here said it was probably a fluke and that machines misread things wrong sometimes even though my disease frequently causes an enlarged aorta and I was having every symptom of it. But basically they said my heart was fine and I have anxiety even though the leading cause of death for people with my disease is stroke. The techs also said that it looked like I had an arrhythmia twice during testing but when I asked the doctor about it he said that it was probably just the wires moving around and was likely nothing even though I have a family history of arrhythmias. It makes no sense why he was determined to dismiss all my heart issues. At least they gave me copies of all my tests so I could take them to different doctors. Well actually they forgot a few of the tests but at least I have some. The nurses on the cardiology unit were really nice though! Two of them even made a TikTok with me that went viral which was cool. But what it comes down to is I didn’t go to the hospital for cool, I went there for severe chest pain and was dismissed as anxious. But also there were two things listed on my paperwork as diagnosed that they didn’t mention to me??? High blood pressure and something about an electrolyte and fluid balance disorder. I didn’t hear anything about that until after I left the hospital and read my papers. The neurologist also saw me and did some scans and he seemed confused about my condition. He came in my room all happy to tell me that I didn’t have a brain tumor and I was like what??? Obviously not, I’ve had a brain malformation all my life that is the cause of my brain symptoms. I’m not even sure if he noticed it?? But I wasn’t extremely worried about that part because I already have been diagnosed with it like 4-5 times. He also insisted that I go on epilepsy medications even after I explained to him that PVNH is drug resistant and that medications don’t work for me. I literally started on a low dose of a medication I already know doesn’t work for me just so he would stop treating me like I was irresponsible for not taking meds. Like they seriously do not help me and my old doctor took me off of them before they left the practice. I don’t think the doctors here know what they’re doing at all. The nurses on the cardiology unit get a 10/10 from me though<//review>

<text>This place is Shameful. Like if you are unconscious and are unable to request another hospital. I understand you are @ the Mercy of these Ppl( Can't even call them humans). Pls if you are able to go any where else pls do so. This place is horrendous. The treatment of patients it is unreal. I can't even Convey me experience to give insight, because iam still in utter shock. Why would i person that has zero compassion want to work in healthcare? What is the point? Unless acess tp presciption 💉. Once i settle i will give my experience😳...Pls dont go to Centinela.Pls! ⚠< /text><Gmap_id>0x80c2b6f83a67fdcd:0xe418c09b8f34ff58< /Gmap_id></record>

<review>I was just released yesterday after experiencing COVID symptoms. Since arrival was taken to tent and given attention by 2 Military Veteran's never was I worried about my condition they told me doctors would be here in an hour then started getting my fever down and drawing blood they had everything under control...

Once I was taken to the hospital 7th floor, I never ever had so much attention by nurse's RN's-LVN's and CNA's (Joyce, Mary and Hyacinn) top nurse's....not to mention Doctors. Sorry if I didn't get their names.

They explained what the procedure was for the day before blood results came 2 day's latter, checking on me every hour until fever and chills where under control.  Results came back Negative everyone passed by and said Hi.  Outstanding service and staff excellent hospital.

I'm a US Army veteran.<//review>< name>

<Review>$4,000 for a shoulder injury that was never diagnosed, nor given treatment other than a prescription for pain killers. walked out of the hospital not able to lift my arm fully for roughly a month after my discharge.  The only thing useful was a sick note.  Called, and emailed offices during office hours in attempt to settle billing and payments, no return calls.  One of the offices gave me a figure of roughly $600, to which I said that doesn't sound right.  Staff then proceeds to suggest calling a separate physician, and separate radiology department, that apparently never showed up in their system, when I asked what my bill was.  Had I paid the $600, would they still hold me liable for the amount that only later showed up?

All associated entities, including physician and radiology are hospital departments, yet their bills did not reflect on the overall bill, I had to practically call repeatedly to investigate as to what my exact bill is, on top of numerous calls not being answered.

I can understand that an emergency room fee being elevated than urgent care, but at $4,000 for virtually absolutely nothing being done, this seemed excessive, which makes me think if it's priced to cover expenses I don't know of.  The agreement between insurance and this hospital was not made public, so it could literally be snake oil they are charging us for...< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2b6f83a67fdcd:0xe418c09b8f34ff58</Gmap_id></record>

If I could give this hospital zero stars I would!!!!! Worst hospital ever. My cousin with disabilities was there twice and his mom never got to speak to a doctor. They ignored court documents and never had a Spanish speaking translator, nor they would allowed a family member to translate even with mother’s verbal consent..</Text>

Emergency room nurse patient ratio is unacceptable. Nurses were being rushed to get patients out they didn’t have time to clean their rooms. Triage would bring patients back to rooms and not let the nurse know she had a new patient New grads were noticed to be trying very hard to take care of patients and be considerate and were continually told your not fast enough hurry up this is about money and getting patients in and out don’t worry about anything else<//Text>

<Review>Absolute worst hospital I ever been to. I’m from out of town and was in a head on car collision, sent to the ER with a lack of urgency. I’ve been here since 4 pm and have yet to be fully examined with a Cat Scan for my chest pains and hip. Workers here lack knowledge and attention to their patients with information on what’s going on. If I could give zero stars I would.  This place needs new administration ASAP !</Review></record></dataset><record>

Worse hospital ever.. My toddler was having breathing complications.. We called 911 and the ambulance suggested they take the baby of course I road with them. The Nurse Michelle was really nice but didn't have any real medical knowledge.. They discharged my daughter because someone else's needed the bed.. We where instructed to sit in the germ infected waiting until we where able to reach family members for a ride.. Everyone is sleep at this hour..I asked to speak to the supervisor for some help..Mark came out and asked if I could afford my own taxi. At that moment I knew this hospital was the worse.. The older white security was very respectful and understand to everyone even homeless people.. May God continue to blessed him and this hospital staff.. Definitely not community people.. I'm still waiting in the lobby two hours later just contacted my family smh<//Text>

ZERO STARS!!  These people need to remember the reason they have a Job in the first place.  They are more concerned about the the hospital getting audited and getting high scores while inspectors are around but forget all about the patient care in the process.  I will NEVER seek medical attention from this place.  The Insurance companies need to be notified and maybe ALL will be revealed  by having secret inspection done.<//text>

The staff was both  professional and friendly, they took time with my mother and myself to explain everything that they were doing, the doctors were great and friendly also. They did everything in a very timely effortless manner that left my sister-in-law and myself not wanting to have my mother transferred to Kaiser. We both work at different hospitals that do not give the attention to patients like  we received at Centinela Hospital.<//Review>< Pics>

<Text>NEVER GO TO THIS HOSPITAL. The hospital is in my network but the doctor at the ER was not they would not accept my insurance United Health Care nor were they willing to negotiate with them. The service was slow, rude and I still have to schedule an apt with a real doctor. Don't let them take your money.< /Text>< pics>

<Date>1560981966893</Date><text>The wait time at the ER was awful and inefficient with people signing in then leaving and returning after they had been called, which slowed everything down. I went in with abdominal pain, when I began crying in the lobby from pain the security guard checked on me and a nurse brought me an ice pack. Almost every single staff member I encountered was kind and compassionate. I was very stressed that I had to have my appendix removed but the ER MD Dr. Green was awesome and personable and made the whole situation more bearable. Everyone from the transport guys, imaging staff, to the MDs were upbeat and caring. I had 2 nurses that weren't amazing but adequate during my stay, overall I think I had great care and would recommend this hospital and staff to anyone in need.</text></record>

This hospital Management is rude to all caregivers they don't paid them the minimum salary wages according to labor dept. CA and demands a lots of work overloading staff (caregiver)with duties which  is a result of a poor QUALITY OF CARE. Multiple of patients falls it's been overall occurs in this Medical Ctr because management particularly a head lead nurse indian-amerI can related to owners they just care for bussines on going. How can they're fools the DPHS?< /text>

<text>My experience with them was great! I got sick really bad and went to their ER. Admission process was quick, my nurse was very caring and professional. The doctor explained me the diagnosis thoroughly and it was easy to understand. Loved all the staff who helped me. When you are sick, one thing you want is someone who shows compassion towards you and provides articulate medical care, and they provided me those. oh and I can't forget to mention, I got a lot better after the visit! Definitely 5 stars!<//text>< rate>

A year ago I came here due to constant abdominal pain they made me wait 14hours just to get a bed for 2hours then be sent home and be told I need an ultrasound n other tests done. Now my daughter gets bite by a stray kitten cutting finger open, we've been here 4hrs  & they still haven't helped her only helped those that came after us for only a cough!! Wtf</Text>

The worst hospital.....everrrr💯... if you are not on your death bed and maybe not even, then do not come here.  The service is soooooo bad... don't risk you life,  they don't even have a doctor who is on site.... let me drop some names so that we are clear...Dr. Atkinson, straight clown... give  black doctors the worst name... you will only be serviced by nurses from UEI, ICDC and ACC who speak less english than a 3rd grader except for 2...literally.....please don't give them your insurance money or any form of payment.... learn from mistakes.... this place should be closed ....like 2 years ago<//review>

This is a horrible hospital. Their Fast track system is very backwards and will have you seen at the earliest within 4-5 hours. And that's just for a nurse to speak with you and have you sit back in the waiting area. Take your health seriously and go the extra mile to visit a better facility that will actually care for you.< /Review>

This hospital is okay to me. When I go to the ER I get seen in a reasonable amount of time. The staff, doctors, and nurses were all nice to me. However, the restrooms are filthy and need to be cleaned. The service just depends on the day, time, and amount of patients needed to be seen.< /Text>

Emergency room personnel do not know what they are doing.  They need more training.  Like one "nurse" said, this is the only place that hired me.  Once you are admitted, you see the professionalism and level of care in the staff.</text>

<Text>My Momma was here and they did a pretty good job taking care of her. She was a tough patient at times, and the hospital did a good job taking care of her. I wish they would have explained more things to my family and I. Luckily they referred us to a very very good skilled nursing facility called Primrose which took great care of her and got her home strongly and safely.

I hope in the future they can be better and communicating things. We felt a little left out at times, but aside from that they did a good job.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

Im giving them 3 STARS because
1. PAY PARKING FOR EMERGENCY $5.00
2. STAFF IS RUDE
3. NO PARKING NEAR OR AROUND EMERGENCY ROOM.
SO if you have an EMERGENCY you will have to PARK AND WALK and possibly COLLAPSE BEFORE YOU GET THERE...< /review>

So just to sum it up someone is in the lobby sitting in their own pee, not a joke, they literally have peed on themselves twice and not one employee has addressed this issue as of 1 hour.I’m in absolute shock that this hospital is actually running. This is about as bad as it gets. I would actually rather have gotten seen by a doctor in an alleyway than been in this sad excuse for a hospital. But alas, this is the hood, so that’s how it is. Makes me sick to my stomach from the security to the nurses. It’s almost laughable, but I am truly disgusted.<//review>

1 star because the wait is not worth it they don't react quickly they take there time with everything when people are hurting, They ask you to sit down when you ask  when your getting called on or they just lie to you one spent more than 9 hours in this hospital just to get checked smh<//text>

This Hospital is horrible, avoid if you have a true medical emergency. This hospital is failing it's community. Terrible service from staff, very unprofessional. Unacceptable wait time for true emergency conditions. Staff seems minimally educated and unconcerned with aiding those who need help; not attentive at all! Staff acts like they hate thier job, their life, the patient that come through the doors and as though they have somethng better to do. This hospital is a joke like something you see in a ghetto movie.< /Review>

The hospital is clean and staff are nice but their emergency room makes no sense. I have been waiting for a bed for 7 hours! If why I was here wasn't important enough to them then why didn't they just sent me on my way.  There's no point in leaving now. This is awful< /text>

<text>Only cause I have to put a star or I wouldn't but some of the nurses suck here especially Shani (short curly haired) who is a coward and only talks but doesn't do much. So much for becoming a nurse who doesn't help and doesn't know much. What a waste.<//text>< name>

STAY AWAY FROM THIS HOSPITAL!!! GO TO KAISER INSTEAD... If I could give it zero stars I would! David that works the admitting window in the ER room, needs to be fired along with the nurse Adrianna! I checked in at 10:25 am due to a stroke and chest pain,  around 12:18 pm (still waiting) I started having chest pains, I let “David at the window” know and he told me to tell the nurse, I told the nurses that I am having chest pains and it feels tight, she said “ok, let me see what I can do.” I sat back down and waited patiently... it is now 2:46 pm and I’m on my way to another hospital now because I have not been seen or helped at all!!!!! I COULD HAVE BEEN DEAD BY NOW!< /review>

First off let me say that the first nurse and front end receptionist were awesome. While they were not super great social skills they understood the severity of my situation and took care of me really well. and they really seemed like they wanted to help even though they werent super empathetic people.

That being said for what i was in there for i had some really major problems where i was completely scared for my life forcing me to AMA myself as i knew i was in danger. I strictly asked for half doses of narcotics and as this was late night i want to be awake for anything done to me or want to be able to agree to it. However as one of the times i fell asleep i remember waking up and without me asking i remember dozing off as i already have sleep problems and they said they just gave me another vial of morphine to ease the pain. This is something i strictly didnt want, I DID NOT WANT THAT. I firmly dont like having that many drugs in me and was not fair. for the next 14 hours i was knocked out. I remember waking up and the nurse i've been dealing with was actually like "Its crazy how long you slept!" Well no kidding. they literally drugged me. The next few hours observed my significant other came over and also noticed as did i these guys were handling a picc line ( Which is a line directly to my heart) without ever washing their hands or putting on gloves. Now, most of them do carry alcohol in their pockets and can scrub it before the room. However, the nurses were literally walking into the room touching the door nob and were not doing it. I actually had to wait until she was there and confirm that this was happening for actual proof.

The next issue was i take a non narcotic medication for pain with a different issue i've been having. After being out that long i had none of it in my system and i really needed it as i was hurting extremelly bad. They forgot to put it on my chart apparently and told me i wasnt allowed to have it. At this point i was starting to have insane spasms. I was under extreme amounts of pain again i told the nurse i really needed it. And because i was getting a lack of fluids i noticed i was extremelly dehydrated which amplifies the problem.  I was denied and was told unless a doctor approves its not possible. I told them again i need it, actually need it. and finally asked if they could do something else then for the pain or call the doctor. they told me i was no longer allowed to have anything to help with pain and believe me it was so bad. i was so emotional i actually had nightmares for the next 2 nights. Maybe a third we'll know tommorow.

Lastly, they said they would contact my doctor about my picc line because they wanted to put a new one in for no other reason then "It should be changed every 3 months" I was told previously from multiple other doctors its not uncommon to have it up to a year. so they wanted to do a surgical procedure to me and claimed that they were gonna do it and have confirmed it with my doctor. i dont believe them as her hours werent in the time frame but i will find that out tommorow as i made an appointment.

Be very careful with this place. they literally drugged me and took advantage of me, touched me with dirty hands for more then likely the entire time i was knocked out. This is serious people, really serious. This place is dangerous. Honestly i've had bad experiences before but nothing like this. this is the first time i've ever even been forced to write a review.< /text>

<Review>My husband and hospitalized there.  On the parients parients parients rights a person has the right to have someone to represent them. But they won't let anyone stay unless the person is dying.  Not only was the house manager rude she showed no interest in my husband's health but was more worried about the care they do not provide being noticed.  If this hospital was not serving predominantly blacks and Hispanics it wouldn't be that way.  They treat you like a second class citizen and make got feel like nothing.  He was on the 6th floor and the truly this hospital treats us like garbage.  If anyone on here can guide me to an official place to make a formal complaint i would appreciate it.  They send you to management which is probably the reason the hospital is in poor shape.  We had to go there because that's where the ambulance took us but never in my life have I personally witnessed such a dreadful place that's job is to provide service.  It doesn't even deserve a scoring of 1.<//Review>< Pictures>

Went into emergency room for a mild allergic reaction that was becoming more severe by the minute. Waiting for 2 hours and then the nurse informed me that the doctor wouldn't be in until 30 minutes later. So much for being an "emergency room".< /Review>

Never again.
I was there on Saturday 5/26/19 a few days ago. The nurse was very nice, but I’d rather have a doctor or nurse with not the greatest bedside manner and QUALITY than nice ones who give inexperienced care. I have a picc line and it goes straight to my heart - until I can get in home care my doctor told me to go to the ER to have them clean it which has to be done once a week. And if anyone handles it, they should use sterile gloves, mask and rubbing alcohol and a picc kit.
The nurse didn’t use a mask, I had to tell her to wear a mask - she didn’t even know how to flush it - she said she’d only been working there since February 2019 (like 3 months?) she kept trying to flush it and then another nurse came over with NO GLOVES AND NO MASK, who just pulled the dressing off and opened the lock. My husband was questioning them and they made it sound as if the do it like that all the time and it was no big deal.
My husband was like, “If that’s the case, even I can do that!” My oncologist nurses said only an RN can clean my picc line and they need to follow procedure (gloves, mask, tagaderm, date when cleaned etc.) as well as the nurses where I got the picc line put in. While I was still there, I had to use the restroom - I was hooked up to fluids and I told a nurse and a young guy can over and unhooked me and said I could use the restroom - I walked to the restroom and felt something cold on my side - I thought it was dripping from the fluids and checked - it was BLOOD all over the side of my gown! The kid didn’t even lock the picc line.
I’m at the ER in San Gabriel and they are cleaning my picc line the RIGHT WAY - with the kit and according to protocol.
If you ever want to go to an ER that’s QUICK (I was in and out of there in three hours TOPS) and you don’t care about quality medical treatment, go to Centinella hospital! 😫😳<//Review>

I really don't get the negative comments.  I been to this hospital so many times for my pancreatitis among other things, and the hospital staff are wonderful. Very professional and everyone there gets seen depending on the severity of their problem something some people don't understand. It's not on about who gets there first.  I would highly recommend this hospital to everyone, the staff really cares and they always have a special way of letting me know I am not alone. I love it!< /Review>

The worst hospital I've ever been in, staff at the ER is careless, hospital is dirty, security guard at the ER is extremely rude, argued and screamed at me when i asked to see supervisor and still ignore my request said he was authority there. Smh! 1 start is too much for such a horrible place in my truthful opinion.<//Text>

If I could give no stars I certainly would..This is my first and last time coming here..The staff just mopes around so unconcerned.This is by far the WORST ER I've ever had to visit..If I could have fixed the problem myself I surely would have,but I came here because it needs doctors care..What a disappointment!!! I will drive the distance to another hospital..This place isn't fit to treat a common cold..4 hours and a doctor hasn't even peeked in to see what's up?? No the ER nor the rooms are filled with people..By far the worst of the worst..< /Text>

sorry to see all the bad reviews. i went to the emergency room a couple of years back i had to wait like everyone else but after i started vomiting i was rushed in and found out i had a hole in my intestine i was operated on right away saving my life because my system was being poisoned. we have to realize they are trying to see people as fast as they can and most emergency rooms are packed with people that was there before you. doctors and nurses were very professional. enjoyed my three week stay.</review>

I was in extreme pain and was doing my best to stay calm yet was talked about by nurses who weren't even trying to be discreet. Everyone seemed to move in slow motion and took forever to get some help even when I was in a room. The doctors never came in to tell me my results from my ultrasounds. It wasnt that busy either. They left me in a wheelchair in the waiting room when I was picked up and no one came to help when I called for someone to escort me to my ride outside.

<Text>The absolute worst urgent care/er that I have ever been to in my life. I’d rather endure the pain and go on with my day. You will be waiting for 5+ hours. Count on it, even if there’s only one other person waiting to be seen. Absolutely nothing is done to speed up the process, so pray it’s not life threatening if you must stop there. And it reeks. Smells like a nursing home.< /Text>< Rating>

<text>Unprofessional, unkempt, rude, EXTREME lack of customer service. Our 10 month old was transported to this hospital due to a medical emergency.  For starters, the security at the front lacked empathy and courtesy. Seemed like he was bothered I walked in to the hospital and he now needed to get off of his smart phone to help me out. The room they placed us in had blood on the walls and floor, there was a urine stench in the air, and there were old bandages and dirty towels at our bedside.  I must say though, Dr. Hussein, during his 5 minute visit was actually very helpful with his thoughts, concerns, and plan for our sons well well being.  After he left it went downhill again.  They roomed us with a mentally ill patient who was not being monitored and kept pulling out her IV and dropping her urine tub.  As you can imagine this added to the urine stench and blood being dripped EVERYWHERE on the floor.  When I went to complain, the nurse said "ok" and walked away.  They sent someone 10 minutes later with a bag of cookies and juice box for the poor mentally ill patient.  They didn't mind she was still dripping blood from her arm or that there was urine on the floor.  I walked out again to look for a nurse, but again no one seemed to care.  This place is in serious need of professionalism, cleanliness, and better hiring standards.< /text>< Pictures>

<userid>106984944929275519461<//userid><Text>Deducting one star because of a rude receptionist at the ER walk in. My girlfriend was in severe abdominal pain and had questions regarding the process of checking in and the receptionist was abrasive, short worded and rude, throwing the ID back at my girlfriend and simply not showing the empathy and care expected out of the staff at a hospital. she was also rolling her eyes and being short/rude with the rest of the patients that checked in during her shift, as they all complained, one lady even becoming extremely angry and verbal in response. she was at the end of her shift because she soon was replaced by another receptionist. As a healthcare provider, I understand the ER is a frustrating place to work at at times and it's lot of personalities to juggle at one time, however there's no excuse to treat people who are going through some of the worst times of their lives with disrespect because of personal frustration. if one cant handle personal frustration responsibly and adequately they should not be working at an emergency department. otherwise the medical staff themselves were great! would like to thank the Triage nurse and the second receptionist that replaced this rude receptionist during shift change for their caring and sweet nature, they listened and showed empathy. also thank you to the nurses that took care of my girlfriend for being thorough and explaining what was being done in a compassionate manner. overall pleasant experience.

edit: ALSO there was one lady, im not sure exactly of her position, but she was cleaning the waiting room during our wait... i was extremely impressed with her compassion and work ethic as she was non judgemental and kind to every single patient in that waiting room. a few examples include when she helped a homeless man who was in a lot of pain clean his beard by personally cleaning it herself with a tissue paper... or when she helped pick up my girlfriend who was in a lot of pain from the bathroom floor and bring her back to the waiting room. i was truly amazed by her and she deserves recognition for that. great work, please keep that up!</Text>< Time>

I don't recommend this hospital they treated my son really bad he had a big wound in his feet  and they kick him out they didn't care it was night time, no clothes and had a recent surgery in his feet because he was upset because a relative came to bring him something and they didn't let him come in or hand him the things it was 8:30 pm they didn't even want to give his belongings. Security Very unprofessional and rude behavior< /Review>

<text>I went in on June 5, 2015 with a severely swollen left foot, which I thought might have a broken toe.  I was attended 20 minutes after limping in.  It took another hour to be seen by a Dr. Niama, but I received an x-ray, ultrasound and antibiotics shortly after.  It is difficult to wait patiently when you're in pain, but I left in better condition than I arrived.  The staff was friendly, attentive and helpful.  Thank you nurse Linda and the staff of the radiology dept.<//text></record></dataset><record>

My time here was very disappointing and uncomfortable nor did i even get to see or actual talk to to doctor as i was here 8 /18/2017.  Doesn't value patience values or opinions.  They feel they knowledge over serve their right so to consulate never will i return or even if i was on my death bed no way no how .. Dr young and her head dr should and hopefully will be replaced<//review>

This hospital needs to be able to branch off to the airport motel across from the stadium lot just for more room.  Tons of people come to cali where we love to love.  If you're a baller let's put our money together to make sure that they have everything they need caring for our natives along with those who just want to be around us. We have always been strong.  I appoligize for leaving a little while my Cali family.  I've been back now I'm ready to make the changes we have always wanted needed to be a better place to live not be hurt...

In fact, she threw up her hands at the EMT who asked for help and said "I don't know, I'm off.." The patient was so upset she up and left out of the stretcher. The EMT then proceeded to state to his partner, "That's good for us, because I'm ready to bounce." I was absolutely disgusted by the lack of empathy and human compassion from people who are in the healthcare profession supposedly because they care about human beings. What I witnessed really left a really sour taste in my mouth... Horrible.

<review>Absolutely the worst hospital E.R. room I've EVER BEEN TO...what in the world is going on at Centinela Hospital. My daughter had a horrifying experience here. The ER room is the worst place in the hospital; the rudeness , and attitudes,and the blatant disregard you get and feel for your health and safety is scary within itself. It's shameful!! Its imperative that the State check on this hospital for all of our safety and well-being.<//review></record>

Husband was taken there after an accident. I arrived to a nasty, dirty hospital. Piss on the floor, used needle on the floor, used bandages and unused medical accessories on the bed next to him. The nurse offered me to sit down and I told her no way. Walls we're dirty With some stains, from what I don't know. The nurse we had was very good, but never let your people go there.<//Text>

<Rate>1</Rate><Text>DONT go to this hospital. The people who check you in don't care about you. I understand that people who are brought in by an ambulance get seen first but Jesus I've been waiting for over 3 hours when I walked in there were only 3 people infront of me and I'm still waiting. I asked the security guard that's on duty right now if there's any way of letting me know how much longer before I'm seen and he said no. When earlier the female security was nice enough to call to the back to find out for another patient that was asking! The staff in the emergency room don't care if you come in dying..... they'll let you die! This hospital has gone down sooooo much. Don't know why people go there. As for me never again!</Text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

<user_id>111118261163494745117<//user_id><Text>Before I went there yesterday, I called to ask what the hospital would do if I went in for the problem that I was having (abnormal vaginal bleeding migraine, bad cramps/abdominal pain, dizziness, fever and feeling faint while doing anything)and imidiately the nurse gives me attitude then hangs up. And mind you I called because I had to walk there and if I have to go somewhere I don't want to walk for no reason. So since she didn't give me an answer I had to take a 30 minute walk there even though I'm sick and probably made it worse by doing so. I make it there to urgent care and to the back where I see the first two nurses who aren't really letting me speak they're just trying to rush me out it seems. So they give me a little container to do my urine test but don't take me to a bathroom they have me wait in the hall and don't get a chair until I say I'm about to pass out. So I wait for about 25-30 minutes before they call me they send me to a room and I finally do the urine test. The doctor only finds me cause I'm asking a nurse what I do with the urine and he sees the blood. The doctor is ok even though it seems like he's rushing me a bit and isn't really getting everything cause he's asking the same questions over. The female nurse he came in with seems a bit uncaring and just tries to everything quick. So he says he's going to go tests to see what's causing this to happen. So I end up sitting at that hospital all day I get multiple vials of blood drawn but end up getting discharge knowing nothing because the doctor never came back to tell me what was causing this to happen and it's really annoying because I heard the nurses all looking at and talking about my test results but nobody came in the room to specifically tell me, and there was an elderly woman in the bed next to mine who had been asking for a nurse's help almost the whole time I had come to the room I finally got fed up and had to get up and get a nurse for her. Like how do you not care that your patients are sitting in pain like that. Even for my migraine and cramps all I got was Motrin it didn't work but I felt it pointless complaining the nurses weren't going to do anything The discharge nurse who gave me papers on what I already know and came to the doctor in the first place was shocked the doctor never came back like he was confused so he got the female nurse I started with and it's frustrating cause when I was discharged I was being rushed out by that same nurse. And when I ask her for my blood test results she prints out a paper that only lab tech can read. After she rushed me out and had to walk home at night still feeling horrid knowing nothing more than I did when I walked in. I recommend that you don't go there because this isn't the first time I've gotten poor service from this hospital< /Text>< Time>

I was there about 3 wks ago for a leg infection from a spider and the nurses there were very caring but there was one nurse who made my stay at the hospital very comfortable she was very nice and very concerned about me her name was nurse Vivian C. on the 6th floor I'm sending this shout out to her to say Thank You  for all you did for me much love to you there should be more nurses like her and also shout our to a male nurse name Neil he was very nice to me to ,but then there was this nurse name Shirley on the 6th floor also she was very rude trying to be  sorcasted and funny and smart mouthed about everything she needs to go back into training and take notes from Ms.Vivian C. maybe then she will learn something about caring about people who need help instead of her pretending to try and act like she was a certified  doctor with an M.D. degree first she needs a PhD  and stop trying to act like she was black cause I no once you go black you can never go back that's for you Shirley.....</Text>

<pics>None< /pics><review>Edward  from patient admitting was Rude and let us know that he had other patients that he had to attend to ( no one else was waiting). He made rushing gestures  with his hands as of he were in a rush. Kevin helped us because i guess that Edward didnt want to after i expressed my displeasure with his attitude. My mother is blind and in a wheelchair and you want to rush her? Why would someone want to come back to a place that is not welcoming?
He is not helping anyone and we have been working with kevin for at least the last 10 minutes.
I demand good customer service and i was extremely disappointed. My mother and father come here often but  it's time for a change.<//review>< UserId.>

Waited 2 hours to be put in room with mentally ill person who was humming and yelling for no reason about 45 minutes. No doctor visit asked why I was there by 3 different nurses. Asked for another room they put me in room with homeless man with loud tv and flatulence. Stayed ER for 5 hours saw 7 nurses and 1 doctor for 5 minutes and received one motrin no mri or xray or anything so I got up and left another couple days of pain is a gift compared to how they treat people there.

Me and my Daughterr went to the emergency room at 9pm and then we had to wait there till 1pm the next day. My daughter was throwing up and she has a severe headache and I had lots of pain and when we went there we didn't get checked up till 8am in the morning we kept begging them to check us up and when the finally did they just gave my daughter Tylenol they didn't check her at all they just gave her that. And when I told them we wanna go home all of a sudden they start checking me up and they said they didn't even know I was gonna get checked up. And when they finished checking me up they said just go home without explaining what we should do to feel better.We stayed there for 16 hours.And we were sourounded by dangerous people and I got a parking ticket. Worst emergency room ever. And the staff acted like we weren't there and we were not important.
Never going there again!!!!!!!!!!!!!<//Text>

My Name Is Luana Jackson-Gaffney. I would like to thank all the staff and Leopold Lopez the ER PA who was in attendance on my ER visit. I was on vacation in March of 2014. I was bitten by insects and had to be rush to the ER. I was seen by a very caring and professional medical secretary and triage nurse. The medical attendant was also very pleasant and made sure I was comfortable while waiting to be seen by the NP.  I notice that other patients were being treated with the same level of care and concern, so I'm sure that this is how they treat all incoming patients to this ER. Even though I was only there because of insect bites and was a visitor to LA, this experience at this ER added to another reason why I Love California. If I have another medical emergency while in LA, I will use this hospital again. Again thank you to the staff and Leopold Lopez ER PA at Centinela Hospital Medical Center ER.<//review>

I arrived to this hospital to check up after a car accident but the patient examination process was bit slow. I had severe chest pain and doctor suggested for xray but it took bit of time get my turn for xray to be performed. After an X ray I again waited bit longer than expected to see the doctor. Their  emergency treatment seems bit slow. The hospital looks clean but it was bit crowded.<//text>

When I had my stroke in February, That's when I got transported to Centenila Hospital. Not all the staff is bad  Some of the nurse staff actually care. On the 2nd floor where I was transported, they was very kind and courteous to me. But when I got transported to the third floor, they wasn't so nice. When I needed assistance with my urinal, the nurse wasn't very helpful and it tipped over and spilled all over me. Thank god my brother in law stayed over and made sure the nursing staff took care of me. They was giving me the run around when I Was going to leave the facility to Rancho facility to start my rehab. It took an whole month before I was transported out of that hospital to a Kaiser facility in Harbor City. Then my Dr. called Centila Hospital to ask what medicine I was taking, and they weren't very cooperative. I wish this on know one to go to that hospital. I do thank them for helping me, but I feel that some of the people on that nursing staff needs to be retrained. Not all of them, but some of them.<//Text>

Horrible hospital with terrible nurses, they made us wait for 5 hours just for results from blood work. The hospital has a foul smell from the moment you walk im. While waiting in the waiting room there was a mentally unstable person on her menstraul bleeding down her leg. This place is completely unsanitary. When we finally got put in a room, I heard a patient in another room desperately begging a nurse "please help me idk what's wrong and I can't breathe!" Only to hear a nurse respond "yeah sure, you better stop screaming!" She actually yelled at the patient for being in pain.Please DO NOT come to this hospital if you value your health and those of the people you love. Shut this hospital Down!!!< /review>

I had a heart attack and was taken here by the ambulance. Ended up needing 2 stents. Got there on Friday, didn't get the stents put in till Monday. I was told they don't do the angiogram  on weekends (it was Presidents Day weekend). Good thing it was a MILD heart attack. I feel like rest is important when you are recovering from anything, but that was impossible (In all fairness I did get 2 hours one night). Someone down the hall was screaming 24/7, there was a loud gurgling noise 24/7 in the air conditioner even though it wasn't being used, I had more wires hooked up to me, it was like having sex with an octopus, and a nurse was coming in every hour or so to do the same vital signs that the wires were doing. Unlike the issues the other reviewers were complaining about, the nurses, despite their procedural short comings, were all really sweet and friendly. I suppose there were some that had an attitude on other floors as one nurse told me they do 12 hour shifts and don't get paid overtime. It was somewhat hard to get any info from the doctors about what was going on. One doctor told me my cholesterol was very high, when in fact my cholesterol is so low, (97 total), I had been taking pills to raise it up. Despite all that I give them a "good' rating for the simple reason that I'm still alive. Rated as one of the top 100 Hospitals in the U.S.</text>

<Name>Jawid Akram</Name><date>1431581893319< /date><Rate>1< /Rate><text>This hospital and the attending doctor, Armund Hovonisian are responsible for the death of my father... The nurses are unqualified, incompetent, lazy, have no idea what to do in the case of a patient experiencing chest pains.  Equipment is faulty and dated and no one is accountable at this hospital

He was admitted for a virus, ended up with a heart attack in the hospital and he died.  Due to the virus he was on antibiotics and  IV. He had a heart monitor which was not working.. The monitoring desk changed it at least 12  time within a period of 3 days. The doctors and the nurses continued to give him Antibiotics and IV without checking his condition to see if he was retaining water.  Due to excessive fluids, he began having chest pains, and no one was around except my brother and I. We ran out to the nurses desk to look for a nurse or anyone to help and no one was there.. A doctor was siting at a desk, he ignored our pleading for someone to come and check up on him.. good 5 minutes went by, and finally the male nurse came in and asked my father where he was having a chest pain...My father was so angry and in pain he angrily pointed to his chest.  The nurse didn't do anything but said let me check the monitor... His heart monitor was NOT working and he said he was going to call the doctor... ALl this while my brother and I frantically running around for some one to attend to him.. Finally we decided to go downstairs to the emergency room and call EMT.. Good 20 minutes had gone by when someone finally came upstairs tried to revive him with an electric shock.. By this time he had already had a heart attack and never recovered and died 6 days later...
The attending doctor was absolute negligent, he was never available and we had to leave angry messages with his office to call us. The doctor was Armand Houvisian. He deserves to have his license taken away!!!!

We had attempted very hard to transfer my father out of this hospital and the doctor and the hospital denied it although a family doctor had made arrangements for my father to be transferred to an orange county hospital...It was because he was an out of network patient and the doctor would stand to make a lot of money treating this patient.

While my father was in the ICU, the hospital services realized that they were responsible for the heart attack and possibly his death, they attempted to talk with us and we declined, because we had all intentions to disgrace the hospital and the doctor!.. We have made every attempt to go after this hospital and the doctor, but unfortunately no one is willing to take this case  because it has become very difficult and a long process..

Any attorney willing to take on this hospital and the doctor, please do so and you can keep whatever you can get out of these people.. We don't want a penny!!! Just Justice!!!  We don't want anyone to be another victim of this hospital or Dr Armund Hovonisian ...

Any news channel reporters please investigate this hospital and Dr Hovonisian.. THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATRH OF MY FATHER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<//text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

During early June of 2010, Ms. Louise Cox my (Mom) was taken to (CHMC) for an overnight observation on (Sun.) night approximately 9 - 9:30 p.m., resulting from lower-abdominal "moderate" pain and some blood appearing in her phlegm after coughing etc., (CHMC) performed a CAT Scan, then proceeded with a "NG (Nasal Gastric) procedure, which subsequently caused her to aspirate, asphyxiate and (choking) to death during what was considered a..."low-risk" procedure.///

<text>I was born here on November 20, 1987 I'm now 28 going to be 29 this year . They told my mom the chances of me coming out alive when she gave birth to me were very low . Now that she had a lots of health problems during the time she was pregnant with me . The doctors here worked hard to save my life when she gave birth to me . Not all hospital are perfect this one at the time had a doctor that saved my life when I was a born,a baby. If it wasn't because of a doctor here and his team that worked hard to save my life when my mom was giving birth to me . I would be death right now that's reality.< /text>< Pics>

THE worst hospital in LA county by far. My friend has been taken a few times for various medical issues and every time he is given discharged early or given sub par care. LAFD rescue 65 always takes him to that one hospital. Its annoying. We are about to file a complaint with Jcaho.<//Review>

I encourage anyone an everyone not to come to this hospital ever unless about to die. I work here an I would never allow myself to bring my child or any family here at all. The nurses here arent qualified to handle people they are rude and lack respect. The doctors will have you here for hours taking xrays just to make more money then tell you that they dont know whats the problem. Security here has to handle patients who are 51/50 an inmates with no weapons of any kind an u feel bad seeing what they put up with. The hospital also looks like its falling apart as well water leaks in the ceiling in the er lobby and no air condition at all. So from an employee who works at centinela dont come here if you can avoid it an if you can get a hospital transfer if possible.<//text>

<Review>This by far the worst ER I've been to. Horrible wait time 4+ hours of waiting. The nurse/doctor came out into the waiting room in front of everybody talking about PERSONAL medical info. Extremely unprofessional this place needs to get reported how they treat patients here is ridiculous.</Review>< pics>

<time>1548576321244< /time><Rating>5</Rating><Text>(Translated by Google) About two years ago I went for emergencies because of a strong pain, they made me wait for about 5 hours to take care of me even though they saw me very bad, I never wanted to return to this hospital since it was the worst, but a week ago my doctor I programmed an operation in the sentinel, I had no choice but to accept, and I must say that I was very surprised of the excellent service they gave me, all the nursing staff and assistants were super friendly with me and showed great concern for my recovery , between scared to that hospital because of the bad experience I had two years ago, but I left very happy of the great attention that you gave me, I really recommend it when you want to schedule an operation here, but if you go for any discomfort due to emergency, I would say if the attention there, improved

Hace como dos años fui por emergencias a causa de un dolor fuerte,me hicieron esperar alrededor de 5 horas para atenderme a pesar que me veian muy mal,jure nunca mas volver a este hospital ya que era de lo peor,pero hace una semana mi doctor me programo una operacion en el centinela,no tube mas opcion que aceptar,y debo decir que me quede muy sorprendida del exelente servicio que me brindaron,todo el personal de enfermeria y asistentes fueron super amables conmigo y demostraron una gran preocupacion por mi recuperacion,entre asustada a ese hospital por la mala experiencia que habia tenido hace dos años,pero sali muy feliz de la magnifica atencion que me brindaron,de verdad lo recomiendo cuando desee programar una operacion aqui,pero si va por algun malestar por emergencia,no sabria decir si la atencion alli,mejoró</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

(Translated by Google) Nothing is terrible .. they have very bad patient service there are no people who speak Spanish. And if there are very few. Of the pior. Of the Angels. .. they don't take care of you fast since you're going to an emergency ...

(Original)
