This was really cool with great prices and unique items. It's too bad Poway seems to think they need to build more homes and condos so they are closing after today. But they did say until COVID blows over they will be available for online purchases.</Text>

A unique and eclectic store. It's a great place for finding quality houseware items for a discounted price. They have a nice variety of clothings as well. The staffs are super helpful and nice. For those who love to go thrift shopping or always want to give it a try, this is a good place to start.<//text>

I only bought once but they are amazing people. Besides the store, Casey and Rene are absolutely amazing and great people and great role models. I am talking outside the show. Just amazing people.< /Review></record>

Not sure what all the reviews are that say the store is overpriced. I found the items to be very reasonable and on par with most thrift shops. The store is actually very clean and the staff is very nice. Greet you on the way in and out which is always nice.< /Review>

<Text>Extremely disorganized and employees are rude, which I’ve seen in more than one review, leaving my own so the others who’ve experienced this know they aren’t alone. The owners responses to unhappy reviews are very unprofessional as well, it’s pretty clear they don’t take feedback seriously which is just another reason for adding to their 1 star reviews. I’m sure my review will also get a poorly written, unprofessional response. No way to run a business.

Edited to add in response to owner:

To the left of the store upon entry the items on the shelves were all over the place, stuff was on the floor, the isles were crowded, stuff was shoved everywhere. The rude employee was a large man who was very sweaty and had a lot of fat rolls, apologizes, not sure how else to describe him— just a large overweight man with reddish skin tone pouring sweat on a cold rainy day (alcohol or drug detox? Idk)<//Text>< Pics>

<Review>Tons of cool stuff with a huge selection of console games and action figures and collectables. Prices are a little higher than most thrift stores but their merchandise is also in much better condition, with several items still in package. Best selection of NES/SNES/SEGA/Gameboy cartridges I've seen in town with fair prices on them. Good amount of Power Tools, Appliances, Clothing as well. Be prepared to waste several hours if you like digging through cool old stuff.</Review><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

Looking for OVER PRICED swap meet /garage sale items. Then this is the store for you. Not to many bargins in this store. Getting two star for being on some reality show and having a large selection of items. Found better deals around the other thrift stores in Poway. But if you want pay double the value for their Star power then this is the place.I find better deals at the .99Cents store. Hope the owners dont get offended my review?<//review>

<Review>This place shouldn't be classified as a "thrift store". Prices are a bit higher than what you'd expect in a thrift store, but the stuff in this shop was specifically picked out and purchased. Many of the items seemed to be new, or collectables. Tons of variety of things to go through. Might give it a try if i was looking for something specific, and not just an actual bargain.</Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM-3UvMwzpGcuF4jVcKjEjHo-GG7QGo0xBkMU29=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOhQTIFLcoiAkZ_DfI0V9l2Ic8y1s-trsrhnZ3J=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOcb94yma1Bw7urUZMMMAwnm3BR_LfwNnKRA3A8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMVezGeNail5QFZhjPxfu-KgTqCR0yq1nhWuJe8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMyhcvMCeIHffDGcISayFQ79yaMhnCqrM8bSN0n=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNjPS5uDGiQZisxG0qwZ_M27OyWHEr2QOsJiMrY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNNPGS1VM3RPruJ7Nq4ERBhANKP1hfjXZ36aBcs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMUSqf7BEZsGxa70jtM1Uwc1uEHNuo-uQ0LGG-8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dbfa491201c895:0x52e23659bbb4c7ba< /Gmap_id></record>

<Review>I really like this place. Safest store I've been into in awhile. Everyone was wearing masks and the staff is awesome. Got some comics for a good price and did not even make a dent looking thru the comics. Was able to look thru 11 boxes before giving up for the day. There had to be at least 25 more boxes. I wish the comics were grouped together a lil better but would be way to time consuming. Will deff visit again.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Most items are overpriced. Owner is arrogant and rude. I also noticed he insults anyone who does not leave a 4 or 5 star revue. Then why are you out of business? Your prices are a joke and you are rude. So explain that?<//text>

Sorry the store is to expensive for you but since I never met you  or 249/250 of your reviews are in Oregon and WA I just assume that your are a Storage Wars Fan and just don't like us.

< Review>
Love Bargain Hunting at Bargain Hunters. Today I bought the last 2 boxes of a great fragrance, designed by Khloe Kardashian. Bought one last year and love it. Was happy there was 2 boxes left. Saw lots of boxed Barbie dolls too. Can spend lots of time in this place and well worth it.< /Review>

<text>This store is completely updated since the last time I was here. It is clean, the aisles are not too crowded to walk through, it is well-lit and the young woman who was tending to the sales counter and cash register was helpful and friendly. I really enjoyed it!

<Text>I am a huge second hand CD and vinyl person, so I loved perusing the large selection, I came away with a few good finds! However, (and I should have looked) BOTH 2 disc albums i picked up were missing one of the discs, thought they might quality check their finds but i suppose when you take in such high volume that isn't thought of much.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

< review>
I love looking around this shop...while I wouldn't necessarily classify it as a "thrift store" (they don't take donations - they source through estate sales/auctions/ storage units, etc.) it is such a fun place to go and look around at all of the random stuff they have acquired.  They have everything from comic books, old video games, old toys and such to home decor, clothing, and many other odds and ends.  Last time I was there they had just gotten a load from Lamar Odom's estate, which while at the time was not yet tagged, was fun to look at.<//review>

<review>I am very glad they have cheap, french-language '91 NHL cards. I have been looking for those. Only reason I will not give five stars is because, based on their responses to Google reviews, don't take any criticism lightly and can only live as being without a single flaw in the world. I am very pleased with their items, though.<//review><user>108702916555830839843</user><Time>1539659679600</Time>< name>

Was there twice today because I forgot to buy an item I wanted . The lady working was fun to talk to and was extremely helpful went out of her way to ensure our experience was great . Would stop and greet Every costumer coming in or leaving . You just don't see that much these days .

Rene was there when I came back to the store. You could tell he was busy, but still made time to answer my questions . I ended  up buying a bunch of comics , some older video games and an Atari Jaguar!  Got great deals on em too.

I'm moving to Italy this weekend wish I had found the store when I first got here .< /text>

<rating>5< /rating><user>101343279189124548937< /user><Text>Review a little late in coming.  We came up to this store because we love thrifting and are major fans of Rene and his wife on the show.
My son saw him, and you would’ve thought he had met Brad Pitt.  Rene was super cool with him and suggested we take a photo with him and my son.  Great guy.
Now, the store.... it has everything.   I mean that, everything. I can’t imagine doing an inventory, because if you are looking for old comics, they have old comics.  Musical instruments? they got them!  Clothes? yup. (Not yuuuup! (TM))  Antiques, of course! Household items? Do you even need to ask?
The inventory is constantly changing and updating.  I’m lucky I don’t live closer, because if I could, I’d end up spending all of my disposable income here.
If you are in the Poway area and want to look for interesting unique items at a good price, this is the place to go.</Text><GmapID>0x80dbfa491201c895:0x52e23659bbb4c7ba< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>This store is massive and has a surprisingly eclectic variety of goods. Prices on quite a few items feel rather high for a thrift store and verge more into a collectibles store's territory, especially when it comes to pop culture and electronic goods. That said, clothing prices and variety were excellent and worth shopping for.< /Review>< Rate>

Very good pricing and some quality stuff, better than the surrounding thrift shops. Plus you can watch the owners in action on Storage Wars.

I'll be back, because I scored a great deal, and I should have bought all they had!</text>

There is such a diversity of merchandise, kinda like a Museum that takes you back in time. From old video games & systems to tools & antiques. Dishes, DVDs, CDs, electronics, kids stuff, sporting goods & tons of clothing. 5500 square feet of fun...& Great music playing with an Awesome Staff to match!<//Text>

4/18/19 Bought the collectable Chewbacca mug from here and when it arrived, the mug, original box with the original sticker price still attached and even the original packing material FAR EXCEEDED my expectations. I bought it as a gift for my military (SFC) SNL (son-in-law). Thank you Rene! This Warsteiner's for you. 🍻😀👍

Update: 5/8/19 Not to break up a set, I bought Darth Vader & O.W.K. today. Thanks again Rene!</Text>< pics>

2 cons, 1 pro. Pro is that there is a wide range of merchandise. Cons are some merchandise seems priced too high, and they don’t allow customers to use the restroom. I came in here intending to do all of my Xmas shopping, easily $100 and up worth, but nature called and the manager told me to go to the restaurant next door and that I would have to buy a drink from them!</text>

The restrooms is not our doing . Poway  has very strict Restrooms laws , we almost didn't open the store because of those , In order to comply with those laws we would of have to spend over 20k in renovations or we had the option just not to offer public restrooms. The whole shopping center doesn't offer public restrooms with the exeception of the restaurants because they have to by law . We use to send people over there all the time and they would get mad . So now we tell people the restaurants have them but they usually expect you to buy somethings. Anyways Merry Christmas !!!"}< /resp>

I love browsing through Bargain Hunters, they get many items you'll never find at an average thrift store, great tools, antique jewelery and furniture, high quality bikes instead of junk bikes as found in most thrift stores. They even have welding equipment and generators from time to time. You'll just never know what treasures you will find when visiting. They should change their name to Treasure Hunters.</Text>

<Date>1552291524118<//Date><rating>5<//rating><text>I'm indecisive with this place I don't really know what to rate it so I just rated it 5 stars I don't want to mess up their reviews. I come pretty often here. Their stuff is pretty well organized maybe one of the best organized I've seen. I always seem to come here but never buy anything. For some reason they tend to have the same 10 shirts in a row and it's not very motivating to look through since it's kind of annoying to look at the same thing 10+ times in a row (probably the only con to this place). They have some nice stuff. The fitting room is way at the front of the store if you want to try something on and it's only 1 fitting "room" it's just a wall basically with a shower curtain. The employees are pretty friendly here. I have no clue why they sell dinosaur desktop computers for expensive prices even though they are worth $1 maybe $20 at most. I think I saw one for maybe $60 that's a stretch especially since it was like a Windows XP (in other terms it's just super old) computer and people give those away for free all the time. In my own opinion this place is good for tools and movies. The tools are pretty cheap they have like dollar bins for random tools. The Blu Ray's can be a bit pricey but a pretty good selection. They have all sorts of stuff for example: clothes, car rims, bikes, collector items (nic nacks/cards/coins/etc), and retro games.

Overall I still come back it's been about a year since I started going still have yet to buy anything but I still keep coming back. That's why I'm not sure what to rate this place. I guess I recommend coming here? Never had a bad experience here.<//text>< Pictures>

I especially like that you are a humble and suggested to the viewers to do the same. I myself buy auction units in nj and nyc, it is hard work. Thanks Rene for being a cool dude. I am good friends with Joe P the legend, he was in storage wars ny. Hope to see you one day at your store.< /review>< pictures>

<rate>5< /rate><review>Negative reviews can be from anyone.   Probably just a lot of wise crackers who never even visited the store.   As far as price - look, it's a local store with local prices.  Ebay, Amazon, etc. are global & online.   Either support your local stores or they will be gone.  These people carry a ton of risk running a family owned thrift B&M in this digital climate.  If you have to pay a 5% more to buy local... do it.  Either you're giving your money to the likes of Bezos who already has Billions or your local retailer who will appreciate every sale to support their family.< /review>< Pictures>

Sucks,  the people  hardly speak English  .And the  place smelled like raw sewage  .The owner  was fat rude. Kept reminding  people he was on t. V.  And we were all idiots  .Some  of the stuff was over priced  .And some  if the stuff liked like it should be placed in the trash. On the plus side the store was big and did have slot of stuff. Down side everyone was rude
And I did like want was  being sold. My advice  shop somewhere eles</Text>

You shouldn't, as an owner, insult customers who give you bad reviews. That is very poor customer service, and that doesn't involve any price issues. Get the "picture"?< /Review>

I was so excited to finally go see Bargine Hunters store today. We finally got there..OMG!! It was such a HUDGE disappointment...most of the items in the store were very old not worth 25 cents. Very dirty unorganized.  Very disappointed.

If you read my review you would notice it says NOT WORTH 25 cents.. Dont get upset about mu review. Just CLEAN IT UP. MAKE IT WORTH GOING.</Review>

Had a couple of great pieces of furniture and prices that made me wish I wasn't moving into a studio apartment.  Parts of it feel a little claustrophobic and disorganized, but that can be fun too.< /review>

< review>
So theres about 6 thrift stores right in this one shopping center n one across the street. Best part about here amongst the other thirft stores, is bargain hunters stay open the longest by and hr or so. Prices r a lil high but still can find good deals. Random stuff at times which keeps me goin bak(never know what they have next). Good selection of dvds, n tools n Right in front usually have shirts n low priced clothing. And yes lot of times u see mr bargain hunter and his wife helping out n talking with whoever. Chek it out</review>

I had a hard refund I had to file. Jackson Hewitt made everything easy. And took the stress away. The lady’s were friendly and did everything they could to get me the biggest refund they could. The price was way too high but everything else was good</review>

This Jackson Hewitt office is open now through April 20 2020. The fees are reasonable. The tax prepares are very kind, knowledgeable, and patient. They offer full tax services. Including electronic filling and ability to pay fee straight out of your return. So no need to wait for money. I'm a 3 year customer and very satisfied.< /Text>

This Lady is AWESOME!!! Carmela T. has always treated me with kindness and she's a truly an experienced tax preparer. She's very knowledgeable and she moves quickly to get your tax return filled. Times moves by fast because she's so personable. I've been going to her for years. I highly recommend her to prepare your taxes. Thanks Carmela!!!<//Text>

Olivia was a dream to go thru taxes with, my husband and I had a blast laughing with her.

The office is clean, conveniently located and staffed with upbeat, polite professionals who take you in hand and walk you thru the process step-by-step making certain both of us understood clearly what was done and why, how it would adversely affect the end result doing it differently, discussing the pros and cons with us...

That personal attention was worth every penny and Olivia worked to save us money while getting more back than what the fees were to do it, you don’t get that every day or just anywhere.

I highly recommend having your taxes filed here.</text>

Last year I will use Jackson Hewitt.

Horrible customer service, very rude and cannot schedule appointments properly. 2nd year in a row we recieved horrible service at least the first year they attempted to correct the problem. This year was just horrible on all accounts from mis scheduling to showing up and being halfway through the filing when someone else comes and being told to collect our papers and come back tomorrow. Down to the scam that is their early return gimmick. They dont give early return dont fall for it. They dont tell you that the bank has to approve it and then they dont, they just suck you in to filing with them. They have no control over their bank and yet tell you you will have your early return in less than an hour. Then you get text saying your went approved and your stuck waiting same as if you waited for the w2s. Its just a gimmick and wont fall for it again.

Horrible service and gimmick advertising< /review>

We just had our taxes done and Gracie and Carmela did a great job taking care of us, Carmela even went so far as to review our taxes from last year by another company to be sure we did not over pay our taxes.
Both ladies were very kind and patient and I would recommend them again<//text>

<text>Came in wanting to switch first of all manager was extremely nice asked what service we needed and told us an estimate time on how long was the wait so we went to Starbucks next door came back and it still wasn’t our turn which is understandable it was extremely busy so if you’re thinking of stopping by plan to be in there for some time . The girl who helped us out was really nice gave us an amazing deal on the iPhones that me and my husband wanted offered us a case and screen protector at first I told her no because they are super pricey !! But then she told us the benefits on why we should get them there , her and her co worker with long hair even showed us how well the life proof cases are ! The environment in the store is amazing seems like everyone there is enjoying their job there and not like those other stores u go to where the workers just don’t even care about ur questions . The amazing part is that she helped us set up our T-Mobile account most workers just tell you to do it yourself , thank you Kimberly you were so helpful !!< /text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None</response>< GmapID>

Called ahead of time to make sure the phone I want to purchase was in stock. The associate named "David" reassured me they do indeed have it in stock. Came in prepared to purchase phone, but when they brought the phone out, it was a totally different model phone!!! Wasted my time, my gas, with no apology. RUDE AND UNPROFESSIONAL AS WELL AS UNAPOLOGETIC!!!! #TMOBILE YOU NEED TO RETRAIN YOUR ASSOCIATES!!!
You'd think it would be easy to check if there's a certain phone in stock! But no, they are too busy chit chatting how they have it the worst, working on July 4th.

<text>I purchased two IPhones the rep put my cellphones under someone else's name instead of mine. I provided my driver's license and i verified my full information with someone over the phone. Now, I have no service because I'm under investigation with T-Mobile department for 2 IPhones. I have a sheriff report looking at me as a criminal. I did everything accordingly to the law. Please do not go there they steal people's identity and you get stuck with charges without using them.< /text><Date>1522197825347</Date>< GmapID>

<text>If I could give this location no stars I would. They have very bad customer service instead of helping out with my  issue they just told me to call customer service. I asked simple questions about my bill which the representative didn't want to look back at the memos to help me with my questions. I think they are very lazy. The only time the representatives want to help some one out is when they are selling u a phone other than that they really dont care< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

My rating is based on my experience with Alex, i've been going to this tmobile for about a year now and i prefer if Alex helps me out because i've gotten all my family members' phones from him, he does things quickly and gives you the necessary info you need to make a good purchase and has always addressed any of my questions or concerns readily. the store is a few blocks from my house so it's super convenient for me!</text>

Worst service ever. I never do reviews but man this store just gets on my nerves this is by far the worst store from T-mobile I've ever been to. If you want to go to a T-mobile store, please do not go to this one.</Text>

<Date>1451781012501<//Date><rate>2</rate><Review>They are usually helpful but I went in and this time I got Alex. He was unhelpful. For an issue I had on my phone he said "you have to call it in. We don't do that." When I mentioned they have done the warrentee exchange before at the store he told me NO. I asked if he was tired he said "no, I'm just bord."
Then I asked is this job borning? (As a joke)
He said "yes, sometimes".
Wow! This was such bad experience and I was trying to be nice and this dude was just so negative and unhelpful! And my sister was so excited to get a new phone! And we wanted to kill 2 birds with one stone but this Alex guy he was so negative and really rude! We just went to another store where they were so helpful and just did the warrentee exchange on the spot!<//Review>< Pics>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) Not a star deserves this store, they are despots, rude, poorly ordered and they never help you, nor do they mess with your account. I recommend you go better to the one on Pacific Street, there if they serve you with desire, with courtesy and kindness

(Original)
Ni una estrella se merece está tienda, son unos déspotas, grosero, mal encargados y nunca te ayudan, ni a tu cuenta se meten. Les recomiendo vallan mejor al que está en calle Pacific, ahí si te atienden con ganas, con cortesía y amabilidad< /Review>

(Translated by Google) You never know how to solve a problem, I never have to have a line with you, it is always the same. I would not recommend this place at all

(Original)

I read Yuri's review and was intrigued by the "zen feel" that she mentioned. I agree! Old Torrance Coffee and Tea is a small, calm shop where we relaxed and discussed our plans for a vigorous day full of adventure! I got the acai smoothie for its antioxidants. It was filling, cool, and refreshing at the same time! That was a yummy breakfast for me!<//text>

When I lived in Torrance I used to go there more often than I do now that I don't live there. I was in the area today for breakfast and while I was waiting to meet my daughter I walked over to this fine store and made a couple of purchases. They're iced chai tea latte is the bomb! Great job, Jennifer!!<//Review>

My cold-brew came with free unicorn flowers. Good luck getting that from a big corporate spot. Seriously though, I drink primarily black coffee and cold brew and this spot has some of the best around.<//Review>

<review>So I called during lunch which I had few minutes left to get back to work coming from the bank and hoping they had food ,which usually the food suck at coffee shops ,I got no choice so I decided to give it a try knowing I was hate it, but the way I was treated over the phone when I placed my order made me feel so welcome and for some reason very at home then I added an iced coffee. So when I picked up my order felt so happy with the awesome vibe and how professional they are.My surprise was the tuna sandwich was so big and healthy freshly made with a side of fancy fruit ,,so so happy and grateful I enjoyed every piece of it .I'm definitely coming back again when I'm the area.thank you !<//review>< Pics>

**GREAT BREAKFAST SPOT IN OLD TORRANCE**

Support the local businesses! Located in Old Torrance, this family-owned café serves a variety of specialty coffee drinks, teas, smoothies, pastries, desserts, and other food items.  We enjoyed a tasty breakfast on their patio -- quaint, friendly, and easy-going. All the good vibes.

PARKING
========
Plenty nearby, on the street or the public lot.

OUTDOOR DINING
================
Several provided patio tables and chairs, completely sanitized and COVID-friendly.
Be sure to order inside first before claiming a spot.

FOOD
=====
ACAI BERRY SMOOTHIE - $6.75
Super fresh and delicious. Didn't taste any added sugar (thank you). Generous portion and I felt much healthier.
RATING: 5/5

BAGEL W/ CREAM CHEESE - $3
What a deal. The bagel's texture was chewy and toasty; the onion flavor was divine. Returning for this one.
RATING: 5/5

SERVICE
=======
Quick, efficient, and friendly. All the likes.
They also accommodated us, 15 minutes after closing (sorry, thank you).
Wonderful staff.

OVERALL
========
Definitely liked the vibe here. Nice café and I'm all for it.

HIGHLY RECOMMEND if you're in town for breakfast. Will order coffee (duh) next time.< /Review>

Love Love Love Old Torrance but cant give it 4 stars because the WiFi never seems to be working properly.  Very polite when I ask, but has only helped once.  Dont need massive data stream but everything creative is cloud-based so I can't think I'm alone with this concern.  Otherwise, if you like sweet things, good service, and cool al fresco atmosphere -this is the place.< /Review>

<Review>On a recent trip to the Bay Area, I was craving my Seattle coffee something fierce. One of our friends excitedly took us to his favourite neighbourhood coffeehouse. There was parking in front (wait, what?!) and we walked right inside.</Review>< Name>

<text>This is the only coffee shop in old town torrance would able to get a blended ice coffee. Not Torrance bakery, nor clutch and coffee. The trophy goes to Old Torrance Coffee and Tea.
The coffee shop is not huge but with out door patio seating and the decor inside is so cozy with an edge. It’s that huge brick wall totally got your full attention. Owned by this young lady Jenni she is very sweet and brilliant. So if anyone craving for ice blended coffee drinks, you do not need to go to Starbucks anymore!<//text></record></dataset><record>

The sweet Barrista made me a delicious sugar free Vanilla latte with soy milk.

Baristas are quirky and casual in the best ways. Has wifi and multiple, accessible plug outlets -yay!

Tons of great antique shops are nearby including an incredible WWII antique store right across the street.< /review>< Pictures>

It's definitely has a local shop feel. The menu board was done by hand with chalk, which I thought was a nice touch. I would go so far to say that their pour overs can hold their own against the likes of Intelligentsia and Blue bottle.</Review>< Date>

It's raining all over Southern California so I figured I'd go for a ride.  Lucky for me I can now add to the hundreds of reviews for this charming coffee house in Old Town Torrance!  The Old Torrance Coffee & Tea will not disappoint when you want to getaway but still remain close to home.  Welcomed by a heavy wooden screen door & a beat up pock marked concrete floor I could hardly wait to sit down to watch the rain dancing down from the sky.  The huge picture window here made it worth my while!  Of course they have the standard old scratched up leather chair and couch plus an upholstered chair that's been sat in so often that the springs have sprung.  Trust me though when I tell ya that you won't mind sinking in to it to enjoy your cup of comfort (coffee drinks, tea, chocolate...).< /text>

I like my coffee more coffee flavored than milk.

Although everything I ordered was great so a great experience and have been back twice since.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

After grabbing a breakfast burrito from Astro Burger, head over here for some coffee!  It's a very short walk across the street.  I know it says Food in the name, but it's hard to pass up that burrito from Astro's yo.  So no, I haven't had any of the food here.  But that coffee?  Yes!  Get the FLAT WHITE.</Review>

Cute coffee shop adjacent to Plum Market. They have a lot of seating with good sized tables (one of my gripes with Starbucks). They do not have skim milk or sugar free syrups, but maybe that means they are more authentic?

I got a chocolate ganache latte. It was lovely. The finish on the top with the foam was a nice touch.<//review>

Awesome little coffee shop with amazing pastries and great coffee! Lovely interior with a couch and comfy chairs, as well as a couple of two person tables to sit at.

Larger groups can sit outside at their larger tables with a street view!

Pro tip - if sitting inside at the couch and plush chairs,  don't use your computer and WiFi. That area is reserved for people who want to sit back and gave an IRL conversation!</Text>

Good cold brew, hard to find that. I hate Starbucks coffee, so it was nice to find this place in the area. Great Iced Mocha.

Cheddar bagel w/ cream cheese is also great! Not a bad selection of pastries and baked goods. And they have some fancy desert items I would love to try.<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Loved it, the coffee was amazing, very nice service and likely the best place in the neighborhood, where you can get a delicious oatmeal breakfast. Highly recommend the place.< /text>

<user_name>lana walling</user_name><date>1435361028451< /date><rating>1< /rating><text>Had a very unfortunate experience here. The sign says $2 minimum to use the wifi for up to 2 hours. My friend and I spent the morning there working, after spending over $20 on food and coffee. We left for a while, then came back in the afternoon to buy another $5 coffee and wait for a friend.  Less than 30 minutes later we were asked to leave because of their wifi policy. WE WERE ASKED TO LEAVE. We weren't even using the wifi anymore, and besides that there was a customer who had been there all day on his laptop. But he wasn't a black man, whereas my friend was. There's no explanation except that this place practices racist policies, and it was a very sad and embarrassing situation for us both. Deeply depressing to see these kinds of practices happening openly in today's culture. I urge you to take your business elsewhere.<//text>< pictures>

The person working they drive through must be on a timer to take the orders because they give very short answers to menu questions. My 5   Piece chicken tender was cold.  If chicken can taste  stale that's what this chicken tastef like. They are also trying their hand at cold fries and got rid of the potato wedges. It seems KFC is taking fast food to a whole new low unfortunately< /text>< Pictures>

Myra, the night ‘manager’: was little to absolutely no help and even had the audacity to hang up on me when I called to ask why my order was incorrect. Admitting that she often hangs up on customers because that’s the protocol at night due to the influx of prank calls- doesn’t seem professional but, sure. Had a lot of HAIR in my food which is why I was calling to complain and the food was all upside down. Honestly, it appeared that the food had fallen, and then simply been put back into the bag. The popcorn chicken was hanging around the bottom of the plastic bag. The bag holding the food had hair all over the bottom of the bag alongside the food. Miraculously, would not offer a refund. As if i would want a replacement order from this same location? Yikes. Spent over $30 @ this location, to call it a wash. Fire everyone.<//text>< Pictures>

<Review>Order a family meal, it took 25 min to get my order, before u ask yes they had plenty of chicken. The employees look like they were taking their sweet time to do anything.Also order a chocolate cake, instead they gave me a cinnamon bun, that is basically their bread soak in sugar and cinnamon.Love the food but not going back anytime soon.</Review>< Pictures>

The restaurant looked nice and clean. Great customer service from Alex at the front counter. Chicken was finger-licking good! The only con was that power outlets didn't work.<//Review>

<Review>If I could give zero stars, I would.  We stopped for a quick meal on our way down south and I thought we could get a variety of food, and vegetarian dishes for some in our party that don't eat meat.  After 20 minutes in line, we finally were able to order.  Or try to order.  They did not have any mac n cheese.  Or corn on the cob.  Or fries.  Or potato wedges.  Or popcorn chicken.  Or cole slaw.  Now we knew why it took so long to order, because everyone had to rethink their meals!  We finally ordered, got to the front and were given our food.  Then told they did not have bbq sauce.  Or silverware.  Or napkins. PATHETIC!</Review></record></dataset><record>

Always fresh and good meal deals for families. Better for larger groups on the deals ask for the $21 call or meal you get a bit more for almost the price of the meal deal for  $18+tax< /Review>

The food was ok. Maybe it was just my luck or a bad day but the chicken was a little dry, the Mac and cheese also a little dry. I went around 12:00 during lunch time.< /text>

For being fast-food, they have excellent customer service every time I go. I love the $5 fill-ups (chicken littles & famous bowls). Sometimes the drive-thru line is a bit lobg, but they get you through rather quickly & order correct.<//text>

Drive thru was closed, while a car was getting their food at the drive thru window. We were a few 5 minutes before closing & didn't expect this to happen. I guess they want to give business elsewhere.< /Review>

Kfc can be busy at times but know that the products always fresh. I myself was a chef so I can guarantee that it's always hot and ready.</Review>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Review>Horrible customer service. Went up to drive thru intercom and no one responded for minutes and then we went up to the window and asked "is the speaker working?" And this lady comes and is like, sarcastically "oh yes, it works" . Then she was complaining to her workers that no ones on drive thru. These guys have no idea what they're doing. Scum service, scum employees, get rid of them.< /Review><Time>1489375557204<//Time></record></dataset><record>

The fish, rice, zucchini and coleslaw were FANTASTIC. The portions were so large we'll happily be eating again tomorrow. This is a great place that we will be frequenting from now on.</Review>< Gmap_id>

<review>This place is a solid five. They added Paella to the menu. The Paella was good but a little dry and the seafood a little overcooked.  The salsa, fish tacos and the  rest of the menu is real solid.  Very clean and very nice owner and staff.< /review>< Gmap_id>

<Date>1612326493842</Date><review>to start off, I really enjoy this place. We especially love taco Tuesdays. However, tonight my wife placed a phone order at 6:10 PM. She was told the order would be ready within 10 minutes. I arrived at 6:25. I watched four other parties who walked in after me and ordered from the counter get their food and leave before the manager checked on me. While I appreciate his attention, I did not get my order until 6:45. This is the reason for 2 stars. The quality of food deserves five stars as usual. Hoping things get better.< /review>< gmapID>

This place is quickly becoming one of my favorite go to spots. Fish is fresh, flavoring is just right. I love that I can request zucchini and brown rice without some ridiculous up charge.<//review>

<Review>Love this place but lately, when I place an order for pick up, it's never ready on time. I call up to 20 minutes in advance and I am always told that it will be ready in 15 min. The last 2 times, I've had to wait at least 10 minutes for my order. I can I'm advance because I'm tired after work and I just wanna grab my meal and go. I don't always mind the wait but I would like to know I'm advance, that I will be waiting a while regardless of how early I place an order.
But the food is amazing and you cannot beat taco Tuesday. I will never stop coming here lol< /Review><Time>1603859860204</Time><name>Celi Gonza< /name><Rating>4<//Rating><pics>None<//pics><gmap_id>0x80dd33d6db3a0aa3:0x4bc3210525e9263<//gmap_id>< user>

I had the fried catfish. The batter was very crunchy which I like a lot. I do not like mushy batters. I also had grilled zucchini and fries with it. I enjoyed my whole meal. Found it filling hot fresh and acceptable price for what I got. Full plate, full stomach. Nice clean environment nice staff. They also have food on display at the counter so you can see what you're ordering. I will revisit again.<//text>

<review>After two years, I finally got around to coming to Howlin Rays. Thankfully, I went at an hour when the line wasn't terribly long, so I was able to get my food in 1 hour. What I noticed about this place is that though it is a long line, and jam packed inside the restaurant, everyone is in such a great mood and the staff is hospitable and helpful. No one is cranky, nervous, or panicked because of the workload.<//review><name>Samuel Collins<//name>< user_id>

Best taco Tuesday if you're looking for fish tacos. Can't beat $1 per battered or grilled fish taco. They also serve alcohol and have a great selection on condiments for your food.< /Text>

I can still taste the flavors of their tostadas and like Pavlov's dogs I salivate at the thought. The gnoochi is my fav but so was the steak and the duck and the other dishes I tired. Working through the menu apparently. It's the kinda place I want to stay open so feel obligated to spread the news but it's also the kinda place I want all to myself. I even took my mom and she's a tough one to please lemme tell you. What else can I say....it's all good!</review>

Good place for reasonably priced fish plates.  Tacos on Tuesday are $1. Not the best but definitely good for the price.  I come for the fish plates.  It gets crowded at lunch on Tuesdays.< /Review>

<Review>My boyfriend and I went in yesterday to get some fish tacos for taco Tuesday and let me tell you ! My boyfriend said they were the best tacos so he needed to take me to try them. We ordered probably 5 minutes before getting there through the phone. We got there and paid, the whole thing was quick quick. Under 5 minutes later after we paid our food came out and we were ready to go. Delicious $1 fish tacos on Tuesday! Either grilled or battered ! DELICIOUS! I ate only 3 and I was full along with my boyfriend who can eat more than I can. Good sized tacos.
Definitely recommend!< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

< Review>
I was looking for a nice place to get some fish. It really looks nice on the outside on the corner of Willow & Cherry. I just had the basic fish & 2 side items. The fish was ok a nicely battered and flakey 🐟. I got fried Zucchini, and rice. The rice was undercooked. Total cost was about $11. You bus your own table. So really it is like fast food fish.</Review>

Delicious fish prepared to order. Service is friendly and relatively quick. The owner and staff remember customers and makes it feel like a friendly place. I love their salmon in lemon butter sauce with grilled zucchini. There are many types of fish and side dishes to choose from. There are also daily specials. We like to come here frequently.<//review>

For healthier fast food options, this place is a better choice for the area. Ordered the salmon and two sides + drink, and the salmon was quite good! Not fond of the raisins in the cole slaw though. People are eating less carbs / sugar these days. Raisins spoil a good Cole slaw if you ask me.< /text>

Food was pretty good. Not sure if they normally supply dipping sauces for fried fish/shrimp or shrimp cocktail, but our meals didn’t come with any. The customer service was poor, both the front desk and the manager. Didn’t want to help resolve the issue.

I ended up resolving the issue through postmates.</review>

<Review>Good high quality healthy food of course by the name you can guess they focus on Seafood but reasonable price. plenty of parking and friendly staff. I have been here several times and every time was a good experience. Also it's a very casual atmosphere a couple of TVs with usually Sports on. It's in the same parking lot as Home Depot so I usually go have lunch here after I'm done at Home Depot.</Review>< Pictures>

This was my first visit with my daughter and grandson.  First of all I am a little biased because the manager had a LA Chargers jersey (Woot Woot). The dining area was very clean and presentable. As for the food it was very good. The simple fish and chips was very good and my daughters shrimp and scallops kabob was amazing. What was unique was their tartar sauce which is made fresh daily. It was different but actually enjoyed it better than the traditional one. This will not be my last visit when craving fish and chips. Especially for the excellent staff, the atmosphere,  and food.< /text>

They have amazing food and yes, they sell other stuff beside seafood. They also sell chicken and clam chowder soup.I love the fact they have phone orders because the wait time could be lengthy at times
In regards to the pricing: THey can be a bit pricey ($10-$13) but it is to be epected because it is fresh seafood and that is always expensive anywhere you go. However,they do have $1 fish tacos on Tuesdays and these can be fried or battered ascan be the chicken. THe chicken tacos are not $1 though. THe staff is always friendly. No complaints whatsoever there and they keep the place real clean all the time. THey helpacommodate large parties as best they can and try to speed up the process of receiving orders. . I will definitely return. GOcheck them out and then follow our travel vlogs on instagram @thehungrynomadz<//text>< pics>

<time>1541389497264< /time><review>This is a good fish place. Fried fish is crispy, grilled is done right, and prices are OK. The slaw is sweet with both raisins and pineapple, which I don't like. Stand up ordering and waiting takes a long time. Pay attention while waiting, because they overlook and mix up orders more than they should.< /review>< user>

<review>I like every thing I've ordered there! With that being said you must try the "Cippino". It is only served on the weekend & until sold out that specific day. (That is my only problem) They don't serve it every. It is a tomato based soup/stew filled with Shrimp, Fish, Crab, Oysters, seasons, onions, celery, etc. AMAZING Flavor. My first time trying it! Try it if you go on the weekend.< /review>< Gmap_id>

Ok...this is weird:
Earlier today, I was at a convenience store and bought a couple soft drinks for the Vietnam Veteran in the red trainers.
Then I come here for dinner and the manager, Salim, comped my supper when my debit card failed.

The broiled catfish was amazing.
Definitely get the slaw.
The service...
A++++++++++++++++

+++++

everybody please, PRAOK.

I always enjoy the grilled fish tacos.  I like that it's cooked fresh ,so don't mind waiting.  Atmosphere is clean, pleasant  and staff friendly.  Great meal for modest privce.  Great location in Signal Hill.  Not to mention the view from the hill at nights is spectacular !< /Text>

Friendly people. Taco Tuesdays are best here since they still have $1.00 taco unlike everyone else in town that's raising the prices.
They have a salmon dish that's really good as well. It's kinda cool that one of the owners us a fitness enthusiast makes you feel like she would watch to serve you healthy food, plus she's behind the counter working as hard if not harder than everyone else.< /Review>

The fish is great and cooked perfectly. Their fish tacos are only like $3 a la cart which is cheaper than Del Taco and about 10 times better. I highly recommend this place!< /Text>

<review>Amidst all the fast food places that can easily give you a heart attack in this area, Fish-o-licious is a welcomed breathe of fresh air and fresh seafood.  Food is made to order (except fried options).  Fish is fresh and prices are great.

<Text>Very nasty cold food I ordered $40 in food and the cashier Leslie took the order wrong I corrected her then my food still came out wrong & cold they didn't clean the shrimps all the way so there was still veins left in the shrimp then they had to cook the zuchinni again because they served it very cold. I will not be returning.< /Text>< GmapID>

ASADA TACOS: one of the best meats I have tried can definitely compete against king taco asada meat. Products are fresh. Meat portions are nice.

GRILLED SALMON: I always ask 3 minutes on each side. Its fully cooked. Excellent taste. Not a fishy taste.

OVERALL FOOD IS GREAT AND HEALTHY.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

< Review>
I was a little sceptical after reading some of the reviews, but I am completely satified I love sourdough so the bread was perfect fish was good, nice size pieces. Only thing that was a little weird were the shrimp not bad but weird I love fried shrimp, but not sure if I’ll be trying those again. Side salad was large and everything was fresh!!!!
I also ordered a brownie which on the menu says brownies for almost $3 but it’s one.... haven't ate it yet but I hope it’s really good for that price.....
Thanks fishalicious I enjoyed the meal.< /Review>

I just went there and got to go and got a fish plate I asked her what it is and they told me it's fish and chips so I said it's fried fish..tell me why it comes with the skin they cut the fish down the middle and grill the one side so the other side still had like fresh scaly Skin and on top of that I got rice instead of coleslaw and they didn't change it and the sourdough bread that comes with it is gross I honestly never leave reviews but it was just too much I had to leave one The fries were cold an stale I don't know how this place has such good reviews. And for the Price it is definitely not worth it.< /Text>

I had the shrimp which was tough and flavorless on top of vegetables that were over salted and left a bad taste in my mouth. The rolls were dry,hard, and horrid. The salmon that my partner had was flavorless that they put on top of the fries making them completely soggy and I'm sure they game me the wrong soup because it didn't taste anything like clam chowder I had ever tasted and defiantly didn't have a single clam in it. I really hate having to write this because they did have amazing customer service but I hate it even more that I paid over 30 bucks for food I couldn't take more than one bite out of because it was so bad.<//Text>

This place is terrible over all I give it a quarter of star or lower if I could. My sister's food was really crispy near Bert as if somebody had left the food cooking for too long. My son said his chicken tenders were flavorless and the sauce was not good. My fajitas didn't even taste like fajitas. They were flavorless, and when I requested salsa to spice it up, I was told that there was none and all they had was tapatio packets.I  asked for money back the girl just rounded up 5 cents. I went back to ask for the rest of my money and she declined and said "Oh it's just a dollar". The tables and floor were very sticky and the stains on the table were like melting metal and casting it onto the table. Overall, I recommend this place to nobody. This place is beyond overrated. Had this been the very last option for food in the whole world, I'd starve. From there I took my business to a real eatery, CA Fish Grill. The person that referred me here, I recommend that they dont refer anyone else to this establishment. I posted a review on Yelp and the owner was very rude and nasty because they didn't like me review. The way I see it, this business will not last too much longer< /Review>

<Review>Ok so it's Tuesday! EVERYBODY knows what that means. TACO'S!!! I wanted to try a different spot this week so I stop at Fish-O-licious on Signal Hill. The staff was polight and ordering went well. I grab mine to go. I get home to find out ordering didn't go as smooth as I had hope. I ordered some grilled fish and some fried with grilled zucchini on the side. I open up my food to find ALL fried fish taco. #ImUpset so I decide to make the best of it and dig in... It's COLD it's HARD and unenjoyable . Not Crunchy folks... HARD!! Now instead of eating TACOS and kicking my feet up I am here writing this review.. BAD EXPERIENCE for me😑</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

I didn't really know what to expect. I'm not a big seafood fan. I went on a Friday and they had clam chowder in a sourdough bread bowl. It was really good, I'm a big guy and I couldn't finish the whole thing. Not as good as what I've had at Fishermans wharf in SF, but still good. The clam pieces are small, but there's a good amount. My wife ordered the Basa fillet,  cajun style. It was a really mild and delicious fish. The cajun seasoning did not have a whole lot of flavor to it, but it was really good for someone who does not normally eat fish. I would be happy to return anytime. The place is clean and moderately busy. The wait staff are super nice. We also ordered brownies for dessert. Nothing special about those, I wouldn't get them again. All in all, a really enjoyable dinner.< /text>

Got the three tacos and 2 sides deal with rice and coleslaw. The fish was fresh, but the whole meal was bland. Nothing special. The best part of the meal was the coleslaw, rice was overcooked.< /review>

My husband and I go to FISH-O-LICIOUS very often, and our usual purchase is that of the fish tacos. Their food is very delicious, and we highly recommend this restaurant, also customer service is awesome!<//Review>

Friendly staff, lots of pretty good food for a very reasonable price, pretty ok service. What more can I say? If you're looking for the fanciest, classiest, or best Italian/Americana food in the greater Fresno-Clovis area,  keep looking. But if you want to have a great meal with your family,  or a romantic dinner with a pretty girl, or just a nice place for some lonely drinks Tuesday afternoon, this is it.

I worked at Giuseppe Gallos for a little over a year, and while there were some rough patches, and some times when the food or service was not very great, the restaurant would consistently come back with wonderful, flavourful food and a warm, welcoming atmosphere.

The head chef, Lou, puts so much time and soul into every dish he makes. He works harder than any person I've ever seen, on the food and on the restaurant. He's constantly coming up with new ideas and new ways to be better. When I was a dishwasher, I closed with all of the cooks, and Lou would always stay the longest, cleaning and prepping food for tomorrow. On every holiday, he would work himself to the bone to make sure everything single thing was perfect. He was pretty funny too.

I've seen lots of criticism of the new owners, and a lot of distrust, but when they took over, the restaurant was on its last legs. If you add to that the fact that they didn't have a liquor license for a good four months, it's a miracle they kept the place open. But they did keep it open, and now business is going great (from what I've heard). The new owners have a lot of really great ideas, and even if some of them won't work out,  they will do amazing things for this little Italian restaurant in Clovis.

*Also: Steve makes some hella bomb snacks.</text>

Been here twice for lunch, had the Kitchen Sink and another time had the Salmon. Both were delicious! If I had to chose again, I would definitely get the Salmon again! Was perfectly cooked and seasoned with a nice lemon hint. I literally cleaned that plate because it was so delicious.  I highly recommend it.</Review>

Sauce is good. I don't particularly care for Meatballs but they have the very best. Really enjoy when Parker or Sean takes care of us. Since the restaurant changed hands it's not as good as it used to be. The bread was much better before the change. Overall still good.<//text>< gmapID>

Very nice atmosphere.  They have good bread for while you wait.  Usually don't like ranch dressing but really enjoyed theirs on my salad.  Recommend Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo, sauce was creamy and delicious.< /Review>

< Review>
Portions are really small. Came in to place a to go order and was told the portions were good size. Just be prepared that the portions are smaller than you think. Staff was rude especially the lady up front. She definitely judged us based on the clothes we were wearing. Food was good but I definitely have had better. Probably won't return just because of the staff and lack of knowledge on portions.</Review>

An hour into our meal we were getting ready to leave and a few of us got up to use the restroom as she looked us and rolled her eyes.  Then she came over and rudely asked where the other two in our party were and were we ready to leave.  Well, we had 8 in our party so I’m sorry it took us a little over an hour to relax and eat!  I’m pretty sure we won’t be back.< /Review>< pictures>

We arrived at 5:30 for our reservation and they were not yet fully staffed...took 30 min to get drinks while we watched the server/hostess socialize and check her phone.
Lots of the old favorites are off the menu. Used to come frequently...now will not.
Will update if we return and give second chance to new owners.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Since the change in ownership, things are going downhill.  They changed some of their best recipes and we stopped going here.  They used to have the best pizza in town, but once they changed their crust, the pizza stopped being so darn good.  They also changed their garlic fries, and what a sad day that was.<//Review>

Waited 30 mins to be seated(in a non existent seating area) for 35 mins, asked the waitress a question about the food, 15 mins later finally got the wrong answer we where hoping for before finally being asked about a drink order (with 2 kids under age of 10. Waitress came back once in between. Awful experience, won't be giving them any more business....<//Review>

Went there for the first time tonight & it was awesome.  Our waiter was greatgreat, the food portions were great. I had some & bread before my meal & had about 4 bites of my plate  but couldn't eat more. I was simply stuffed. Had the chicken Alfredo, it was delicous. Definetly recommend this. With reservations our while visit lasted an hour. Great service, great food< /review>

Love Giuseppes, the food tastes homemade which is so comforting, compared to the typical chain restaurant menu. The service is always great, very friendly and accommodating. The music they play in there is old fashioned, frank sinatra like, and even though I am young I love it! It's just so different from any other restaurant, its appealing. The only negative I have is the set up of the dinning area, it looks like they haven't updated the layout in a while and Chef Ramsey would love to go in there and dress it up so everything flows better. Yet this does not affect me from going there or even choosing another italian restaurant.<//Review>

Great service, and very cozy atmosphere. We loved the bruschetta and  deep fried zuchinni  for our appetizers and our dinner was so amazing!  We had the chicken marsala and chicken parmigiana. Can't wait to go back!<//Review>

Went there for dinner at 9:30pm on a Saturday after a softball tournament because their website said they were open until 10pm. We were told unceremoniously that it was too late. Didn't even say they were sorry. So much for trying to patronize the independents...< /Text>

Wish I could rave about this place, but their food is so inconsistent that I can't rate it above good.

Staff is fantastic.< /Text>

Great place to spend the night. It is a first come first serve basis. As soon as you enter the campground, pick up an envelope from the box and look for a empty spot for yourself. Once you occupy your space, fill up the contents in the envelope and put your money in it and drop it in the drop box. It off a total self service campsite.
It had 52 sites to occupy. Each site costs $12 which is pretty reasonable. At max 6 people per site. RVs are not recommended here because the roads are pretty narrow to enter. No potable water in this location.</review>

<text>Peaceful and clean campground. We easily found a site by arriving in the early morning. The road to reach the location is sinuous but really fun! 🏕< /text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMO8WMlIU6wi4VKuUX6BOdv0E7X_L-1KNI9VS7k=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x8096e8fc041cae79:0x4c5e82c378658146</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Stayed for three nights in late July. Rather crowded during the weekends. We arrived at 8.30 AM Friday morning and were able to get a nice spot. Gary the Campground host was a nice very nice guy. Quite primitive - only pit toilets and no running water. There is a creek in which you can take a quick dip (though it is cold), and also use the water for boiling. Nice new tarmac on the 3 mile road from the main road to the campground.< /Text><username>Peter Rosenbæk Olesen</username><Resp>None< /Resp><pics>None<//pics></record></dataset><record>

Gary is a helpful camp host that enjoys his job and it shows! He let us walk around and pick out a campsite. We arrived at 7:30 on a Wednesday morning in mid August and had quite a few to choose from. No water except creek water.< /Review>

<review>Gary the camp host is very professional, camp grounds are a good size, with a bear box, fire pit, and picnic table. This campsite does not have running water or showers. The trail head for El Capitan starts here.</review>< pictures>

< Review>
Tamarack flat is a great campground in the high-country of Yosemite national park. It is located towards near Crane Flat about a mile and a half of the SR 120. The campground itself is nicely situated in the bottom of a valley — it takes about 10-15 minutes to drive in — which keeps a lot of visitors from using it. The campgrounds are nice with bear-vaults, picnic table, fire-pit, parking pad, and your camp-spot. They can, unfortunately, get dirty towards the end of the season. The campground also does not have any running water. All water must be collected from the stream and treated. There is a lot of great hiking right out of the campground which also serves as a trailhead for trails that go up to El Capitan, for example.</Review>

Simple campsites with table and fire ring. Stream nearby for water.  We arrived on a Thurs morning and happened to catch someone as they were leaving. The place was full the 4 days we were there. It cleared out a little on Sunday morning. Otherwise, it's tough to get a campsite. 40 min from the Valley and 1 hr from Tuolomne Meadows.< /text>

Visited last in early 80s, it seems by others descriptions to have been improved upon given it was once closed down for sanitation issues. Sites are generous and quiet.< /review>

<review>It's hard to get a first come first served campsite, but this campgroup is pretty nice  it's tucked away from all the tourists and it had a relaxing environment. There a charming little stream running through which is nice. My only complaint is that you can only pay for the campsites in cash. Other FVFS campgrounds offer the possibility of paying with a card< /review><pics>None</pics><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x8096e8fc041cae79:0x4c5e82c378658146</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Great Campsite, you can have your privacy and enjoy camping, the downsize is there is no running water and it will be cold at night. Otherwise this was one of my best Trips to Yosemite.</review>

<rate>2< /rate><text>It's a pretty basic campsite that doesn't take reservations, so it's tough to guarantee a spot. Campsites are wide, but are hard to tell where the boundaries between sites are. The sites near the entrance get pretty loud and people enter at all hours of the night, so it's not a very quite camp site.</text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

such a great place to camp.  the 3 mile road to the site is freshly paved and isn't scary to drive down.  This will now be an annual tradition.<//Text>

Absolutely amazing place to spend the night(s). We stayed here for 4 nights. The toilets are clean, though they are non-flushable. Some campspots are located on a hill, which is inconvenient when camping in a tent. The supervisor seemed friendly though we did not see her that often. You are allowed to make campfire's, which is a big plus because the nights can be very cold.<//text>

< Review>
Visited after the July 4th Long weekend. Looks like I was lucky to get a campsite.
Campground  : 5/5
Maintenance  : (-10)/5 reason I gave 3 stars.. Toilets can't stink more than I experienced out there.. I am regular camper and but haven't experienced anything like this.
Camphost -   I didn't see him during my 4 night stay. Might be the reason behind toilets stinking soo bad. I am sure he is good guy but sir you need to take care of the toilets.. $21/night was not cheap.

Anyways - leaving aside the smell, the campground was too good. Not very far from Yosemite Valley.</Review>

SO I WENT AND BOUGHT A 2018 33FT COLEMAN. THE PEOPLE THERE MOST ARE VERY NICE, BUT THERE ARE A LOT CLOSE TO THE MANGEMENT THAT ARE TROUBLE MAKERS THAT DONT CARE FOR THE FOLKS OF COLOR MUCH. FOR TWO MONTHS THING WHERE GOOD, THE ALL SH---- HIT, MY FAMILY AND MYSELF HAS HAD TO DEAL WITH A LOT OF HARRASSMENT AND SOME ONE MESS'S WITH MY NEW RV , THEY HAS MOVED MY TEMP FINCE SO MY DOGS COULD GET OUT, THERE ONE LADY HERE THAT TALKED THERE NIEGHDOR INTO MAKING A FALAS REPORT TO BOTH THE MANGER GARY AND TOO ANIMAL CONTROL. FOUND THIS OUT THROUGHT A TEXT THAT WAS SENT, AS WELL AS ANIMAL CONTROL CAME TO LET ME KNOW THEY DROPPED THERE COMPLANT. THEN I WAS GIVIN A 30 DAY TO MOVE OUT. WITH OUT RESON BECAUSE THEY CAN, GARY THE MANGER IS A BULLY AND HIS BOSS GOSE ALONG WITH ANYTHING HE SAYS. THEY ARE GETTING RID OF GOOD PEOPLE AND KEEPING THE TRASH. HELL KNOW I WOULD NOT TELL ANYONE ABOUT BAMBOO TREE RV PARK . THE MANGER TELLS EVERYONE ,EVERYBODY BUSSINESS HE IS NOT PROFESSIONAL AT ALL. SO IF YOU LIKE LIVING IN DRAMA, DEALING WITH RACIAL SH-- THAT WE HAD TO ENDURE. THEN THIS IS THE PREFECT PLACE FOR YOU. THE BAD PART IS I STAY TO MYSELF AND ONLY KNOW 1 PERSON. WE WERE NEVER GIVEN A KEY TO THE LAUNDRY ROOM OR TO THE RESTROOMS AND SHOWERS THAT ARE HERE FOR TENANTS.. SO DONT FALL FOR THERE SWEET TALK ITS REALLY ALL BAD. MAKE SURE YOU TELL PEOPLE  TO STAY AWAY FROM HERE IF THEY WANT TO LIVE A PRIVATE  LIFE. THIS ALL HAPPENDED IN LESS THEN 3 MONTH. THE COLOMAN IS MINE  THE REST IS WHATS HERE IN THE PARK, I WAS TOLD THAT MY SPOT LOOK REALLY BAD. LOOK AROUND. THE FRIST AND LAST BELONG TO ME. GOOD LUCK< /text>< pictures>

<Text>I've been there for 6 months or so. Park is clean. No drama or BS. People keep to themselves. Quiet at night. I have no complaints.  Colleen, the Manager, has always been very friendly with me.  I would recommend this park. Rates are very fair. I Just wish it had cable but you can't have everything in life and that's why they have satellite TV systems!<//Text></record>

I am the current manager of Bamboo Tree MHP. Management and owners are working diligently to make this park a great and inexpensive place to live. It is an older park and along with that has some "backbone" issues that we are addressing. Just recently we completed a major renovation to part of the sewer system on the RV side of the park and are planning major capital improvements in the coming years. The issues with roaches can only be put on the people that allow them to thrive within their trailers as it is with any home... it is as clean as you make it. We are striving to see that all homes are kept clean and free of any type of infestation. Bamboo Tree is centrally located with a light rail station a five minute walk. Sac Flea Market is right next door with a Rally's a ten minute walk. This is a great park for those on a fixed income with RV rent  averaging $550 a month including elect and water. The mobile home side rent is $474 plus utilities. There is overflow automobile parking available as well as RV and boat storage for a fee. Come on by... it's a nice place with great folks living here... there's a reason we have very little turnover and spaces rent quickly!</Text>

<Text>Bamboo Tree has all the hallmarks of a troubled RV/MH park that has been neglected by management - HOWEVER - There's a new sheriff in town, and the park is under new management, and Kirk and Colleen are great, and are doing a wonderful job removing troublesome tenants. Between May and August 2015, at least 6 of the existing Mobile Homes wound up with new owners.

Sadly, there's not a lot that can be done about the RV side of the park. It's an extremely cramped slab of asphalt wedged in between the Folsom Flea Market and the Social Security Office. There's no shade, and there was no way I'd have been able to deploy my slide with the narrow spaces.

Fortunately, there are a number of spaces available on the Mobile Home side of the park, which are VERY generously sized, reasonably priced, and there is only one available site that has no shade whatsoever.
For a long-term stay, AT&T U-verse is available at up to 18 Mbps as of May 2015.

I stayed 3 months in the summer of 2015, and was VERY happy with my stay.
I'd give the RV side 2 Stars, and the MH side of the park 5 stars, the weighted average being 4 stars.</Text>< GmapID>

<Review>I have.been here scince August 2015 and  it so far very friendly community other than that its still a  rough around the eages and needs some work in areas but i think management has a long way to go before they get things really worked out but if your looking for a place to stay. AND you have a R V or TRAILLER its not that. BAD some of the stuff I said before it's still true but you now we cannot forget about the Cockroaches that all the tenants have and the bed bugs this place is not a good place for people with brand new RVs or trailers to live and the managers roommate is more like a prick and he cries to overrun with the manager says so he thinks he's in charge my suggestion to you do not move here it would be the worst thing you could ever do and now they're trying to do now is make this place look nicer buy painting trailers and resurfacing the blacktop and we can't forget about Soos massage salon which it turns out to be a whorehouse and then this month and the last two weeks of last month of this year we have had no manager since the last one left chubby assistant managers in charge< /Review>< resp>

People are real cool..
Everyone. Some people seem mad at the "owners" of this place for several reasons. The rent is kinda super high and electricity is included.. No matter how much you use. Super stupid. This of course has resulted in people (with the "I don't care I'm not paying for it" attitude) as well as people trying to see how much power they can waste. Several extra a.c. units & tvs etc. With open doors etc. Many people are unable to get power when its really hot and the electrical grid can't handle it. The bathroom is locked up for whatever reason.<//text>< name>

<text>Worst haircut I’ve received so far. Left the back of my head looking like it’s been a month since it got cut. Trimmed my beard hair short in some places, leaving dark and light spots, and changed the shape of my beard line I had going. Put “clay” in my hair without asking (even after I stated I don’t use product at the beginning).

Absolutely terrible, I will not be returning again. Waste of $22 and the haircut lady should have her license revoked. Looks like Stevie Wonder cut my hair.

Look at how the haircut lady let me walk out of the store with my beard line. Who on earth would let someone walk out of their business looking like this?</text>< Pictures>

<Text>Anne took great care of me. She was and is professional, courteous, and listens to and gave me what I asked for. Anne is the reason I will be returning to sports clips.
Anne will go above and beyond the call of duty to see that you are not just satisfied, but elated on how your hair looks.

Tina was amazing from the second I opened the door! She happily greeted me and helped me check in - being it was my first time. There was no wait (because I checked online before I left) so she was able to take me right back. There was no problem explaining the haircut I was looking for. I showed Tina a few pictures, she asked a couple questions, and then worked her magic! She used clippers and shears and stopped along the way to tell me what she was doing and show me progress. Very friendly and made me feel comfortable the entire time I was there. To top it off, the haircut was extremely affordable. Best price for an awesome cut, hands down! I don't normally take the time to leave reviews, but this experience deserved it. I've been in CA for 2 years now and this is the very first time I've been please after a haircut. This will definitely be my spot from now on. Thank you so much!<//Review>

It was our first time cutting my sons hair at Del Mar Sports Clips. It was a pleasure experience. My son who’s 12 he was impressed and so am I. He’s in a swim team so he’s constantly in the water. We love the way the lady explains to him how important it’s to clean his hair and massage his scalp after swimming with a good shampoo so we bought the shampoo as well. Thank you so much! My son is looking forward to go back to Del Mar Sport Clips. Excellent Service!<//Text>

<Review>Showed up here because it was close by and I needed a haircut for a date. I was running low on time so I found this location close to where I was at. They saw me very quickly and the haircut was on point and didn’t take long at all. I was also sold some product for my hair and it didn’t feel pressured at all. I don’t live anywhere near this location but I’ll probably be back anyways!< /Review>< Pics>

The girl who cut my hair was amazing! I can’t remember her name but she came in on Black Friday during her days off and was extremely nice and personal, two thumbs up. Even though I’m from Oregon I would come down just for a haircut.

<review>Most of the stylists at Sports Clips Del Mar Height could use some training in listening to the client.  More than 50% of the haircuts I have received there are cut way too short.  When the stylist asks me how I would like my hair cut, I give a specific amount of hair to be cut off.  But the stylist just cuts my hair in the quickest manner possible.

Perhaps they would give a better haircut if there were more stylists, so it doesn't make it seems that they are in such a hurry.</review>< GmapID>

<Text>The service was excellent and the staff friendly.  I told my barber to leave the sides long and just trim the fuzzies from my ears and neck.  Also to shorten just the long hairs hanging over my brow.  My barber got carried away, evidently, and did much too much scissors work all over, including the sides that I wished to not shorten.  What was she thinking?  I'm not in the military nor in public service.  I want to keep my hair full on the sides.  Not happy with the results.< /Text>< user_id>

The lady that cut my son’s hair on 9/13did an amazing job (I’m sorry I don’t recall her name) She truly cared about giving him the best hair cut ever which is difficult because he has lots of hair and super thick. In addition, my husband had totally messed it up by attempting to do it himself. It was a disaster, but she didn’t rush and fixed the unfixable and made it looked perfect! Needless to say my son was extremely happy and so was I. Thank you so much for your hard work! You Rock!</text>

I checked services available beforehand, MVP, Triple Play, etc. I had already shampooed that day so didn't accept the offer of a free shampoo for first time customers. No massage or hot towel was offered. When I left, I was billed for a full MVP experience.  Maybe I'm off base but that doesn't seem like how I would treat a first time customer.</Review>< Date>

A full MVP experience is the haircut, shampoo, scalp massage, hot towel and shoulder massage. We do not have this in partial packages.. for example, a haircut and massage only or haircut and hot towel only, etc. If you paid the full service but only received a haircut only, we'd like to make this right with you. Please email Spencer@SCJM.solutions so we can work something out. The MVP experience is worth it if you haven't tried it yet!"}</Response>< Pics>

This is my favorite place to get a haircut. The women who work there are all great people and are very fast. They also welcome friendly dogs and will give them treats and water. This Sport Clips makes you feel apart of a community.<//Review>

< Review>
I "had" been going there and I guess playing Russian Roulette with my hair for 3 years. After not cutting my hair for three and a half months I went in for a trim before a TV interview. First question - what would you like? Basic Trim nothing more. Second Question - about this much, 1/2 inch? Yes no more. 15 minutes later and I have both sides and back cut down to military grade high and tight and a general mess on top. I have calmed down to the point where I will go in to have them fix whatever hair I have left for free then I go somewhere else.

So I call in to ask for the manager to call so I can get what hair I have left fixed and no call back. I know they can't re-grow hair but they can at least get rid of the ridges she made by not knowing how to use clippers. Oh that reminds me I said "NO CLIPPERS" she forgot that as well.<//Review>

Literally just had to fix a haircut from here. The lady missed several spots on the back of his head, did not know how to blend apparently and took a chunk out of the top of his hair....that was just the aftermath.  During the haircut she complained the entire time about the work environment, how she couldn't grab his hair(what?!?), and other personal issues.  She then upcharged for a previously promised complimentary wash. The worst experience, absolutely will not be returning.</Review>

Price point is similar and since it was my first time I even got a massage...I now know how my wife feels at her fancy salons. Anne cut my hair and did a great job. She was very friendly and listened to exactly what I wanted. Overall, very impressed with SportsClips and thanks Anne!<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Asked for a low fade just above the ears. Left with my hair almost 2 inches shorter and almost a high fade. Just a cycle of messing up and then having to go higher and shorter to fix the mistake.</review>

<Text>I am talking about this particular RALPH store.
The problem is the Manager. I am not sure why but every time I shop there he will be waiting at the exit back entrance, and when he sees me exiting he leaves. This guy makes me feel uncomfortable. I mean does he think I am going to steel or something??? He is totally paranoid.
Some of the employees are not pleasant and welcoming.
I have been coming to this store for 5 years and the former Manager was nicer as well as the employees, but now it's not. They better change their attitudes otherwise it should be changed. Unfortunately it's the only store in Fullerton where I reside.
Totally disappointing<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Ralphs is expensive! And the parking area around it is very tight and difficult to get in and out. I only stop there for food if necessary.</review>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>There is a good mix of businesses here. Anchored by a Chase bank, Ralph's market and The Black Bear. There's a Ralph's gas station next door and the prices are lower than most. Plenty of shops in between (Google it). So next time you go to Hillcrest Park swing by afterwards and check it out 👍🏻< /Text>< pics>

Great little shopping center. Be cautious of the parking lot. It gets busy and is a little on the small size. If you have a larger vehicle I’d suggest parking on the north side of the center by Chase. The lot is bigger and has less traffic.</review>

This center has Ralph's, Chase Bank, a ton of eateries, and a Black Beat diner. Love this place. Plus... it's across the street from the park which is a lovely place to enjoy lunch or a snack or time together.  Get over there and check it out. #enjoylifeitsfree</review>

Hillcrest Park is under a beautification project but you can still enjoy the two separate kids playground area, bbq area, take a brisk run and use the very clean restroom.</text>

<Text>Love the renovations. The stairs can be a beast if you do the long way but you can make it easier if you take a side route. The new fountain is beautiful and really provides a central focal point for the park.< /Text>< pics>

There's a Ralphs supermarket in here. Ralphs tends to be a better store than the neighborhood it's in, and this one's in a rather upscale neighborhood near North Orange County Superior Court. It has a deli with Boar's Head brand products, a bakery with fairly fresh bolillos, grinder and Kaiser rolls, and a friendly, engaging staff. All of the shopping carts are clean and none have game wheels.<//Review>

<Review>The Ralphs in the shopping center has a nice salad bar for a quick lunch, sushi made right in front of you, lots of other dishes to choose from, and fresh produce so I can grab something for dinner. They also have a Starbucks inside. There's also a restaurant that I like to get pho from, and there's a churroholic for your sweet tooth.<//Review>< Pics>

Love shopping at this Ralph's the people there are extremely friendly and they remember you. That's why I drive extra far to come here and shop at this Ralph's. Been shopping at this Ralph's for 30 years It feels weird to go to another grocery store where people aren't as friendly. If i could give this Ralph's  a 10 star raiting out a 5 I would.</Review>

<Review>I was pleasantly surprised at the service I received while visiting. It does take a lot to keep a business like this afloat and while making customer service your top priority, some may see this as challenging. I would definitely return as they rank high marks with me on the appearance and maintenance side.<//Review><UserId.>105310276843156754030</UserId.>< Gmap_id>

Great little shopping stop with variety.  One can get groceries at Ralph's and choose from six places to eat, rent a car, take Karate classes, step over to the dentist, get a manicure, have a hair cut and call it a day.< /review>

I come to this shopping center frequently and I like it. The parking lot can get a little congested when Ralph's is busy but other than that it's great. I've been coming here for 20+ years so I suppose it holds some nostalgia for me as well.</text>
