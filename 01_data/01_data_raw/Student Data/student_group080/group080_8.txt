<Review>Betty is awesome!!!! She is so thorough when waxing.  I'm always pleased with her service. She is my very favorite for waxing.  I love her sweet spirit.

Also, had an amazing massage by Chris!  Hands down the best I've ever had.  His hands are pure magic!  Ask for Chris, you'll be glad you did.</Review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x809ada4d15b7661f:0xe256ed08973b5874</gmapID></record>

<Review>Celebrating my cousins birthday; Mermaid Spa Party. Only disappoinment was they didn't provide the hot rocks with the 'hot stone foot soak' and their robes need to be upgraded. Was able to bring our own food and drinks. Staff was nice, facility was nice and I had a great time!</Review>< name>

<Review>I booked an appointment for my girlfriend for Valentine's day and Vanessa (her masseuse) did such a great job with not just getting all the kinks out of her back, but also made the entire experience mentally relaxing for her as well. I would definitely recommend Mellow Me Out Spa if you need more than just a  massage, the prices are well worth it and the staff is super friendly.< /Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMyQfOs6QHww_biUF52Cga1O2vG14Iu-G4xIZg1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNh1o9Gt4REkqgMgcvzfx4rlNjIPUmVRbp1IO6D=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO_MdhBXRgDJO3L1rvdRDSi5eViNE_ohug74avF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP0OSVpnT6jXIoTF3DbUx2bdEJHP_oZdE17jFFV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< response>

The facility is huge and very new looking, lockers and nice robes. The beds were heated. The esthetician walked me through what she was doing and why. Fabulous facial! I'm very impressed and can't wait to go back.

Thank you!</Text>< pics>

<text>Booking my appointment for a deep tissue massage and getting settled in as a new client was simple and they were easily able to book an appointment that wasn't too far off. There was east parking and the environment inside was soothing but it was nothing stellar. Their facility is clean, great hours and friendly staff.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><time>1553915703853</time><GmapID>0x809ada4d15b7661f:0xe256ed08973b5874<//GmapID><Resp>None<//Resp></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Really hard to find off the street; no signs anywhere. But it's BEHIND Western Dental.

The staff was really friendly and helpful. The overall look and feel of the place was janky though. With as much money as that places makes you'd think it would be nicer inside and outside.

Good prices. I mean, you get what you pay for.</Review>

The staff was friendly but, the ladies that did me and my friends nails completely rushed it. My nails dont look like the picture i brought to the salon at all. They are completely botched and I even had to tell them how to paint them correctly. They didnt understand that because of the color i chose my nails needed a white base layer.... And when i brought this to their attention they didnt even take off the previous coats. Now my nails are sloppy and deformed.</Text>

Mellow Me Out Spa should mellow out. Taking away parking for Senior citizens is crazy. They don't need all that parking space. They don't have that many customers. A friend told me I should try it, I wouldn't go there if they were giving away gold. Can't believe a business would be so thoughtless, and not care about the wellbeing of Senior citizens.< /text>

Bought a Groupon for a Brazilian. It took almost an hour on my appointment. I was in so much pain that I kept having to take breaks. Lady would pull the strip of wax and couldn’t pull hard enough so it was so painful with the same
amount of hair still left. Terrible experience. I’m now going to European Wax Center and I’m out in 15 min and virtually painless<//Review>

<Review>My mother and I went here for the first time. We got massages, facials and pedicures! It was amazing the staff is wonderful!
The first room they take you in after you change in to your robe had a huge painting on one wall and it just feels tacky and the paraffin wax pots all sit in the floor. So I was concerned about what was to come. But it was fine after that the other rooms were much nicer.
I would come back here.</Review>< Pics>

It's a great place!!!!! They have a few energy workers as well, so you can get a little free Reiki at no extra charge!

That review is old, ever since Jen M. left in May I stopped going. She was my favorite and I used to come weekly, now I don't go to that spa at all.</text>

It's been over a year since I've had a massage, the very first real one I had was at the downtown location and it was just for my birthday. I knew I needed to get back in because between doing cross fit and carrying 80lb ladders at work my back became very tense but with life it took a while. Finally made an appointment for Deep Tissue with hot stone placement. I had the the awesome CMT Shay Brooks, he was a god send. He got me started on a path to help release tension I carry in my back, he was very professional and gave excellent advice. I will definitely be back, session 2 coming soon<//review>

I had a birthday spa day with my friends it started off nice as we're lounging around. I booked all my friends appointments as it was time for our massages we all went our own ways. So for 45 mins of getting our back and feet massaged we realized that one of the girls weren't in the locker room. We thought she finished early. After tipping and paying for our services I asked the lady where the other lady went whom was in my party(my friend). She told me that she was in the lounge. Once we found her they told her they didn't have enough time to do her massage or facial! So while everyone else was getting serviced on my birthday my friend was left out. Horrible service! I booked in advance also another lady came in during our party and she got serviced. I definitely do not recommend this horrible spa! Ruined my birthday</text>

My mom has been going to this place since they were downtown like ten years ago. I recently bought her two spa packages and was excited, but terrified because she's I'll and usually reacts negatively to massages that leave her really sick and in worse pain. It baffles me, truly.

So I was THRILLED to see my mom come home both times totally relaxed and not in pain!!! Vanessa did such an amazing job I cannot accurately express my relief. I know that I complain about back pain all the time, but my mom is a prisoner in her own body compared to me and most people, so what a wonderful place that can offer actual reprieve for those that need it most! Thank you, Vanessa!</Text>

I got a Groupon deal for a facial and 20-minute foot soak with calf and foot massage. First of all, the 20-minute stone foot soak with a calf and foot massage is a little misleading. You get a 20-minute foot soak, but the massage part only lasts about a minute. That was very disappointing. Secondly, this was my 3rd facial ever and the only time they used a tool to go to town on my barely-there black heads. I've never had a facial hurt before. They popped things that left holes and red marks on my face. Then the one brand new pimple I did have, they tried popping (which it wasn't ready for) and now it's red and swollen 3 days later still. The products they use must not be very high quality because this is the only facial that has left my skin more dry than when I started. 3 days later and my skin is still flaky dry when it wasn't like that before. My past facials have always left my skin better than before but not this time. They also need new robes as they said to pick one that would be comfortable, but all they had were XXLs and I'm a small. So I was swimming in the robe, and it was thin and worn. For the cost, I'm really disappointed. The head massage was good, but a facial should never leave your skin worse than before.< /Text>

i have been here before and had one of the best experiences...this time was the worst massage i have ever had. the person that gave me the massage was not even there, would not give me the massage that i requested, instead telling me she "doesn't practice" that type i asked here to go little deeper, instead she pushed my shoulder with her hands like she was trying gently wake me, very disapointed!!< /Review>

<name>That Gibbo</name><Rating>1<//Rating><Text>Went in a few months ago around 830-845pm and had a good experience. However I tried calling tonight for my wives birthday (super last min. I know ) knowing she had a rough day and the lady I spoke with basically told me I was lying, they've never taken anyone that late, all while raising her voice and speaking over me as I was trying to explain in a little more detail our first visit.  Anyways very disappointed, I'm all about customer service, been in the CS field for over 15yrs and even if a customer was in correct I would never handle someone that way. She later stated she was the owner (which furthered my disappointment) and began to sound very nervous when I asked her name and info. I'm not one to write reviews, in fact didn't write one when I had a good massage. But this encounter really did not sit well with me...<//Text><userid>105003381541448352426< /userid>< Pics>

<text>For Mellow Me Out, I have one song stuck in my head “Don’t be fooled by the rocks”. My sister in law booked this spa place for our girls gathering. I was totally looking forward for a heavenly experience. At first, I thought the spa was located in Fair Oaks inside the Arden hotel. I must be day dreaming and got my venues mixed up. My dreams shattered into glasses when I saw the location of the venue. If you are reading this review, Mellow me Out is located behind the McDonalds. For a first time comer, this place can be little overwhelming with the area.
We reached the spa at 2pm, checked-in and they guided us to the waiting room. Not the best looking waiting room but it was descent.  After that, we were escorted into the locker room. In the locker room, most of the lockers were either occupied or not working. They have three changing rooms inside the locker room; they could only accommodate three people at a time. Six of us had to share two lockers. We didn’t mind sharing but what happens when there are so many people? They informed us we could change our clothes into the robes. When I glanced at the ropes, I was a little torn apart. They were old and did not have the plush feeling. They provided us flip flops but it was hurting our delicate feet’s. I know we do not come from palaces but we’re paying $110 that’s without the gratuity.
Afterwards, we went to the lounge, there was a mermaid on the background. It was dark with bright colors and lights were dimmed. After we sat down, they filled the bowl with water and hot stones. It felt nice and warm and within few minutes the water became cold. I wish they had added flowers to the water to add a little excitement to our spa experiences. We had booked a spa package thinking, we’ll have the lounge to ourselves but that wasn’t the case here. We had to share with random strangers. And we were allowed to bring wine and snacks but it was a common lounge, it felt strange leaving behind food unattended. And they didn’t set up the table as expected for our wine prior to arrival. I was a little disappointed; the business advertises for the spa packages but not prepared to provide a thrilling experience.
From our package deal, we had the option of choosing two things: Swedish massage, facial or pedicure. Each person was guided into their respective rooms separately.  I was the last one taken for the massage. My masseuses took me to the massage room next to the chiropractor office. I didn’t know they had a chiropractor at Mellow Me Out. My massage experience wasn’t the best. The guy did not massage my lower back and hands. During the massage, he asked if I wanted my legs massaged too. I replied, yes. The massage on the upper shoulder areas was great. He applied pressure on few stress points but the massage was less than 45 minutes. Oh no, I was ripped off on my time. They took me into the room late. After massage, they lead you back to the waiting room before the next service. I waited additional 5 minutes for my facial therapist. Anyways, my facial therapist was on a mission to keep applying and removing different products on my face. . However, she did not perform any dermalogical and extractions. I was totally saddened. My facial experience lasted less than 30 minutes .
I guess that’s why we always notice groupon deals for Mellow Me Out.
Overall review from the girls, we’re not returning back. It was not the best experience.
And yes, it will be hard to recommend this place. For now…all I can keep thinking is “don’t be fooled by the rocks…”</text>< Resp>

I got a Groupon for this spa on a whim, and came here a week ago. Even with the Groupon, the service was excellent and extremely accomodating. I enjoyed a foot soak and a massage. My therapist was very attentive and really helped me relax. Every member of the staff here is very courteous and professional. I'm sure I'll go back.<//Review>

<Review>Great deal for the price, but lots of loud discussion not really conducive to mellowing out.  Services were fine, but not spectacular.<//Review>< Pics>

<text>3 stars because the "party coordinator", America,  did not do her job. Last sat I booked the Margarita Party (which was pretty nice) for today (5/18/17) at 9am. America was suppose to email me a confirmation form, within an hour same day, about the persons involved and terms and conditions in order to save our spot. I called Tuesday because I didn't get an email yet. America called me while I was at work on Wed saying she haven't recieved the forms and if I didn't send them by 1pm, she'll block our appt. I didn't listen to the msg because I was working. But I found out this morning, she didn't email me the forms untill 5 mins after she called! Seriously? I came in for my appt this morning and she cancelled our appointment. Dale at the front desk this morning was very nice and accomodated the inconveince and set our appt for an hour later. The massage and facials we recieved were nice and relaxing but America is the reason for the 3 stars.</text>< pictures>

We ordered 2 item plate.. orange chicken and broccoli beef w chow mien and fried rice. It was terrible no flavor.. totally not worth the $10 spent.. buy when we took it back the guy behind counter blew a gasket  told us to never come back.. good.. weren't planning on it..  but he was very rude.. with his red face.. do not recommend this place< /text>

I like this restaurant! They have good dishes, their menu is large, The cook in that restaurant is well trained, I like very much eating all their food. The food is consistently good, the service towards the visitors  is agreeable. I often eat in this place and I not even once was unhappy. I recommend it with no hesitation.< /text>

Okay, so I was actually trying to go to Aloha Hawaiian barbecue next door but they were temporarily closed. I looked at the reviews and while there are clearly some fake five-star reviews on there (very American names with very American pictures, but with the kind of grammar you only get from a non-native speaker) there were enough others that I figured I'd give it a shot.

We will start with the good: 1.They are the friendliest people you will ever find in a restaurant. 2. The price paid per amount of food is quite good. A two item combo could fill up 2-3 hungry adults for $10.

The less good: The food is just okay. I ordered mushroom chicken and the house special chicken, and neither one were anything to write home about. They tasted pretty similar and there wasn't a lot of flavor in either. If you use the hot sauce, all you will taste is the hot sauce.

That said, the quality of the ingredients was reasonable for the kind of place it is, so the value proposition remains decent.

It would be a fantastic place to go if you had to feed a group of teenagers on a budget.<//Text>

CASH ONLY...not an issue if you carry cash. We went to get cash and came back because I didnt want to pay an atm fee....It was VERY WORTH the drive to get cash! I wish we didnt live 300 miles away. The food tasted amazing, the portions were huge AND they knew most of their customers by name. Will definitely be back when we visit!<//Review>

<response>None< /response><Review>The staff is friendly and pretty clean inside. But the food was very very dry. I barely ate any orange chicken. And I kind of had to force myself to eat the teriyaki chicken. The noodles were also very dry... idk if the food was sitting a very long time but it wasn’t good at all. And beware they only take cash and they point you to their atm that they charge you extra! You’ll pay 2.50 more. It’s smart for them to do this little scam but not for everyone else. Cash only.< /Review>< Time>

Just wow!!! I hardly write reviews mind you. I felt it was necessary. I have come here since I was a child. However, this was one of the worst experiences I've had at any restaurant. Went as far as calling the police. I called back told them if was pointless but in the end we wasted the our time and money at this place. Don't give these people a chance to keep treating patrons like garbage. At this point it isn't about the food they could have the best orange chicken I have ever tasted. It's the mere principle of the fact that their customer service is horrendous. If I wasn't happy their food in the first place why would I want to switch it out? They refused to give us our money back when we were clearly dissatisfied.</review>

< Review>
I had orange chicken with fried rice.....very dissapointed. All I can say is bland & disgusting. Their was a spider on our plate. We left at 8:56pm,their was still people inside eating & they turned their lights off on customers inside eating. I don't know how the owner allows this. I will never go back & I will let everyone I know not to go there. Update:Yes spider you read right!!!! Disgusting! Don't go there!< /Review>

<text>This place is terrible. Yes they give good portions....but quality is poor. I got 3 large side dishes...Beef & broccoli, orange chicken and spicy beef $8 each and it all tasted like it came from a microwave tv dinner. Beef & broccoli was 20% beef & 80% broccoli.veggies in spicy beef was overcooked, limp, soggy and not spicy at all. Orange chicken was hard on the outside & rubbery on the inside. Ive had better chinese quality from places located in grocery stores.<//text><username>Ted Pham</username><user>111904545188931853697<//user><Time>1488939223971</Time><gmap_id>0x80dd289664bb34e9:0x685108d0bdad9806</gmap_id>< Rate>

Decent, had worse but had much better. Has some mild spice to the curry, but the chicken in said curry was bland. Mushrooms a little undercooked in mushroom chiken but has a nice sauce. Chow mein noodles where so so, cooked long enough but bland.</review>

I dont know what the negative reviews are talking about because I've been coming here for chinese food for YEARS and have NEVER experienced half the stuff they talk about.
They have always been super nice to me and I've never had foreign objects in my food (i.e insects, hair, etc)
The only downside is that their drinks are overly priced, but I guess the cheap food makes up for it< /Review></record>

< review>
I loved the store when it first opened. The store manager catered to our community when stocking items that we use daily. But now they see long lines and one of the clerks go on break and leaves frustrated customers to the other clerk. Plus they close down the store a lot during the day for a good 45min or close early like they did Friday 12/18/20. They need a good manger to get on those employees especially at night. Felt bad for the ones that walked to the store thinking it was open . Last I heard the store closes at 10pm.< /review>

<text>It’s dirty outside and inside! They never have bags. They make money by selling the customer a family dollar bags. Someone can get hurt with all those boxes full of items that need to be stocked. They are lazy and bad customer service. You need a new manager because the one you have orders items that our neighbor hood don’t use. And maybe you should order 6mos worth of bags. So you never run out!!! The outside is full of trash! It’s disgusting!!!<//text>< pics>

<text>As other reviews had pointed out... Dirty, dirty, dirty store, indoors as well as outdoors. Untrained staff, lacking in customer service and more knowledge about their inventory. Unfortunately it comes to no surprise since they're continuously hiring new employees but usually have only two employees at a time... Which makes it vulnerable when it comes to thiefs.< /text>< time>

The service is pretty great. The staff themselves for the most part, at least from my experience, are rather nice and seem to care about answering your questions. The products are there but if you don't find what your looking for it doesn't hurt to ask.<//Review>

So there was no carts when I went in so I went looking for one and it turns out one of the guys had it to make his job easier so I grabbed the stuff and took it out to use it and then one of the employees comes and tells me that her Co worker was using it if I can give it back.

<review>This place is always messy and NEVER in stock. If you need to grocery shop, save yourself the hassle and go to a REAL store. The employees never have anything you ask for or they're too lazy to go look.  Shopping here is a waste of time.<//review>< pics>

(Translated by Google) Horrible!!!!! The poor cashier who looked for another job does not work for customer service, she is a dark-haired little woman, black hair, face of stomach pain. She does not say her name on the receipt and that is why I will NEVER go back to that place nor my family and I do not recommend it badly!

(Original)
Horrible!!!!! La cajera q me atendio pobrecita que busque otro trabajo no sirve para atencion al cliente, es una mujercita morena, cabello negro, cara de dolor de estomago lastima no dice su nombre en el recibo y por eso JAMAS volvere a ese lugar ni mi familia y no la recomiendo pesimo!< /Text>

I have finally found affordable quality chiropractic care. I have been returning regularly for three months now and feel better than I have in years. Also, the convenience of walk-ins makes it easy to choose which day of the week works for me.< /Text>

I use to go the Whittier location in the past and had actually cancelled my membership last year. It has been a while since I’ve gotten an adjustment and I REALLY need it but didn’t like the doctor’s adjustments at the other location. I heard a lot of great things about the Doctors in Downey so I decided to just check them out. I was greeted immediately by the receptionist and she was very kind to help me with my account. For some reason Whittier stopped my account I don’t know why if I cancelled but the lady was so quick and eager to help me out she reassured me that she would fix it. She called Whittier right away and thank god I was able to get my adjustment. The doctor was so kind too and helped me SO MUCH with my spine. The other doctor didn’t even do my legs and this one did! I didn’t know there was more to it then just the spinal adjustments. I brought my boyfriend in too and I’m so glad I did! We both ended up getting the membership together and definitely coming back to this location even though we live in Whittier. So worth it.</review>

<Review>The lobby area is very inviting. Receptionist Crystal is very friendly and punctual on checking patients in. Both chiropractors are amazing at what they do and I trust them as I usually have to go twice to three times a week. Being a former gymnast my body does need maintenance. You could say it requires high maintenance. I love this facility and I wouldn’t go anywhere else<//Review>< Pictures>

I went in for a pinched nerve feeling in my neck, and after 2-3 visits I felt better and gained more mobility in my neck. I usually go to Dr. Kevin and leave feeling great. Crystal in the front is always so sweet with a delightful attitude!</text>

{'time': 1611613698252, 'text': 'Hi Cariiime,\nSorry for your inconvenience. Our Wellness Coordinator always ask if new prospects were involved in any car accident. I am not sure why our WC missed to ask you the question. We are really sorry for your inconvenience but our clinic is a wellness clinic and does not specialized with patients that were involved in car accident.\nAnthony'}<//response>

< Review>
Spoke to a rep over the phone about coming in. She took my name down and gave me prices, but she did not ask me if I was in a recent car accident. This rep tells me to just come in, so I ended up going the following day.  I get there and a different rep immediately asks me if I was in an accident, I had been in a small accident the previous year but nothing came of it. They denied seeing me because the doctor could lose their license if I were to take my case to court. I kept telling them I wasn't going to take my case to court but they still refused to see me. The original rep should have initially asked me over the phone instead of wasting my time. The second rep didn't even ask me for my name. This company needs to make their front desk reps ask new patients this question over the phone instead of making people waste their time by walking in.</Review>

<Review>I have serious spine issues and they've been really helpful in my recovery. I sometimes can't even walk but when I make it in the adjustments provide me the relief I need. Customer service is great!< /Review></record>

I love Crystal, Kevin and Dr Himes. Please do what you can to keep them. It's always a very welcoming place to be.  Dr kevin is the first doctor to reverse my scoliosis. The monthly package is the best deal. It's nice to be able to afford weekly care.</Review>

This place is so welcoming. We always being greeted from kristel so friendly and sweet. I would com in with my husband and father in law when I was pregnant but hesitant to do the treatment then. Now that I had my child I really been having a lot of lower back pain so I finally came in a few months later and there I see kristel always so joyful and ready to get me in and out. I went with Doc Kevin and am so glad that I finally listen and came in. It was an INSTANT relief. Like magic. I got on the wellness plan right away and will be seeing doc Kevin more often with my husband. Thank you so much for your help and looking forward for my adjustments!!<//review>

Unfortunately, the only clinic that is able to process your cancellation request is your home clinic where you signed up for your plan. We detail this in our membership agreement so that each patient knows the cancellation process.\n\nIf you visit the Long Beach location, they would be more than happy to take care of this for you, and we welcome you to reach out to us if you need any assistance connecting with them or have any further questions about the process. Again, we would love to help but unfortunately we are unable to process your request at this location.\n\nWe would also like to note that while we don't take X-Rays on site, each patient will undergo a thorough consultation and exam before adjustment, and our doctors will refer you to a place to get them done if necessary. Your health is our priority, and we are here to assist if you have any further questions. Thank you!\n\nBest in Health,\nThe Joint Chiropractic"}< /Response>< Rate>

The receptionist at this location is the outmost most unprofessional receptionist at any Joint location. She is not fit to be the front image of the Joint and has the poorest of customer service skills. As a receptionist, you have to be welcoming, show empathy, be of service and willing to help a patient at all times. She doesn’t. The doctors here are great especially Dr. Himes, but it is a shame that the image you get prior to seeing the doctor is someone that gives off such a bad vibe. On top of that, she gives you wrong information and doesn’t abide by the standards of the joint when you are given your free passes as a new member.
I had gotten a youth membership for my daughter and after her 4th visit she tried using her pass and the receptionist is told her she couldn’t use it with out giving her a clear explanation. If they aren’t going to be able to use them, then why even offer them.
I highly recommend people to go to the Lakewood location where the receptionist there is absolutely amazing! Always welcoming, always smiling, and super nice. This receptionist needs to get some pointers for her. I live in Downey, but will not hesitate to take the extra drive to q place where I can be granted some optimal customer service.</text>

thursday 10/8 i came in around 5:30 and the lady was on the phone when she realized i was not a returning customer she said oh and hung up the phone. she would not let the dr see me because i do not live locally and was not interested in purchasing a package just an initial visit. mind u i am in excruciating pain. & needed this emergency visit. granted if i would have liked the doctor i would have totally signed up. i wasn’t opposed to it, just the pressure to make decisions when all i feel is pain and want relief made it difficult. i called the lakewood office and they assured me they would act professionally and get me the help i needed. also, they are corporate the lakewood office. so they hold true to joint standards. unlike the downey office. i’ve been to many chiropractors for almost 20 years. to work at a chiro office you need to be compassionate about people not about money.</Text>

Called to confirm if walk-ins where welcomed before arriving. The receptionist answered and asked if I was a previous patient and I replied I wasn’t a member. She put me on hold for more than 10 min. I hanged up and tried calling back several times and no one answered.<//Review>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Text>Great Spot! The Chiropractors at this particular location are highly skilled and the front desk people are pretty helpful. However, they recently changed their front desk seating to these hard clear seats and I must say that is a HORRIBLE DECISION for people who come in with constant back problems. Hard seats with no lumbar support is absolutely abysmal if you have to wait more than 10 minutes which is normally the case. Please bring back the comfortable seating! If I didn’t actually really need the adjustment I would have left out of the mere fact that sitting on a hard chair really doesn’t help my back issues.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2cd70d3b78a07:0xc612e38ec0733eff< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I went in with so much stiffness and pain in my neck and shoulder that lasted 4 days and walked out feeling AMAZING! Dr. Del Rio and the lady at the front desk were so polite, professional, and patient with me.  I couldn't move my head in any direction without pain and as soon as I got up off the bench I felt better! I'm sold! I'd gone to chiropractors before and I always felt really nauseous afterwards and this time I didn't at all! Thank you!</text>

<Review>I was a walk in and asked for the $29 session I saw on the window. I knew it was a scam when the front desk associate dismissed my request and began lecturing me about chiropractic care. She stated that the price in the window is how much my visits would be if I bought the premium package. What's more is that the chiropractor at that location showed less customer service. With every chiropractic package expiring within a month and not after the visits are used, it's not worth it for a person with a busy schedule. The reason I give only 1 star is because rather than empathizing with me, the front desk associate began to lecture me on how I couldn't cancel my "membership" until I paid for another package. Yes, you automatically get locked into a membership once you pay for a package. If you don't personally walk in to cancel, your credit card is billed every month till you do so. Also, you will not be allowed to cancel until you pay. This is definitely a class action lawsuit waiting to happen. My advice, hire people that know how to retain customers rather than make you feel like your making some back alley deal. I mean the front desk associate doesn't even take pride in her appearance.< /Review>< date>

Came in for walk in, front lady was rude and told me to wait and sit down. I waited, she handed me forms to fill out. I filled them out, then waited, and waited, and more customers came in the door and got attended before me. It was almost an hour before I finally get attended and didn't even address my discomfort I disclosed on the forms. Without good customer service, this place is done.. Can't recommend it with rude customer service.<//review>

Sat there for over 40 minutes, mind you, I had an appointment, as I sat there I heard the same "Dr recommendations" of wanting to see the patient 4x.... just so happens to be the amount their cult plan offers.. No thank u! I left!</review>

< review>
This facility is poorly maintained avoid at all cost!
Do not store your property here try US Storage by the 10 Freeway (Fremont exit) or the storage across the street.

The door handle to enter the facility has been broken for over a month!

The elevators are constantly broken which takes them days or even weeks and in one case a entire month to repair.

I called the property manager and left a voicemail two weeks ago and never got a call back, I called the district manager "Tony" aka Antonio last week and he hasn't returned my call.

I tried calling the regional manager today but haven't received a call back yet.

There are major ADA violations here and nobody seems to care. This facility also recently declared that they are reducing access allegedly due to break-ins...maybe the break-ins have to do with the door handle being broken for over a month and the door being propped open with a rock?!

Daisy was consistently the only staff member I remembered encountering who was of help regarding associates at this facility. She is polite and efficient. I have to lower the review from 5 stars to 3 because after a break in I discovered there is absolutely zero surveillance on the floor my unit was located. As a customer it would be nice to be informed regarding best security practices or knowledge of known surveillance. There is surveillance outside the facility, but to my knowledge at the time of rental, there was none indoors. This poses a tremendous security risk since valuables were stolen from my unit during a break in. Would recommend people rent from here only if there is a way to monitor storage from your own perspective otherwise proving anything to the authorities will be a complete nightmare from the customers perspective.</review>

<Text>The system cancelled our reservation, even though it was 11 days before the move in date, but I have changed the review from one star to 4 stars. Why? Because the district manager called me personally to deal with the situation. I found a unit that will work for the day we need to move our items. We moved to a different location in order to find the size we needed, so no longer in Alhambra.</Text></record></dataset><record>

My storage was broken into and the employees knew about it and did absolutely nothing. I had valuables that are irreplaceable.  They knew there were break ins and didn’t alert the customers about it. I am beyond devastated and in shock. This is a horrible company. Do not place your items here. I would not be surprised if the employees were in on this . Stay away from this storage.  No apology was given to me for my loss.<//text>

<Text>I thought renting out a space would be difficult but with a great helper like Adriana it was super easy. Came in the day before yesterday asking questions, shown around a few spaces and yesterday I came in for the final rental. Adriana was wonderful and patient when it came to my questions and concerns. Such a wonderful personality/worker! If you're looking for a place to rent look no further Adriana will be your guide.< /Text><pics>None<//pics><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

This location raised my monthly fee by $65 after only a few months there. I think they're very good at getting people to commit, then immediately force higher fees once they are in. They should at least wait until 6-12 months.<//text>

Leslie gave excellent service and did a wonderful job explaining to me the sizes of the lockers available and helping me choose one that was right for my needs. I appreciate her being so courteous and patient with me as I am a very difficult person to assist. Leslie did an exquisite job and I will gladly recommend this public storage to my friends and relatives. THANKS LESLIE !< /Text>

I stopped by this storage place to get some information on prices, Adriana was very helpful not only did she answer my questions she showed me a space that she said will fit my stuff, she really wanted me to take advantage of the promotion and didnt want me to miss out on it. I dont need storage now but when I do I am coming back here to get it because the service is outstanding and the place looks really clean and secure.< /text>

This public storage has the friendliest workers and is clean. They helped me get the correct storage unit that I needed for all of my stuff (i have a lot) and they had supplies to help keep my stuff protected. Thank you Melissa for all your help.<//review>

The clerk was polite and courtesy and did a great job of informing me of what Public Storage had to offer to suit my needs. I was very pleased. Before I had went to another place and I was trying to asked about, what I now know is a climate controlled storage area. The people at the other place looked at me like I was crazy and made me feel unwelcomed. Public Storage helped me figure out the space I needed and offered other accessories, such as boxes and packaging supplies if needed. It was a much better choice than the first place I had went to.< /review>

I am very happy with public storage not only for their friendly attitude but also they are concerned for people's stuff and security. Chris helped me out to get the best storage size that fits my needs and he warned me right away when I did not lock my storage properly. I am very great full with him not only because of his welcome attitude but also for his concern and great job that he performed. I strongly recommend it.</Text>

The service at Public Storage in Alhambra was exceptional.  Jonathan helped me out from the minute I walked in. He was very efficient, showed me the units and got me signed up without any delay.  It was great to speak with someone knowledgable and very helpful.  It was a great experience and the units are very nice too.  Thank you!</Review>

Melissa is the best, most professional employee at a Public Storage place I've come across! She helped waive a late fee that I accidentally incurred being that I was out of town filming on location and thought auto pay had been set up when it hadn't already (nb: they need the physical phone in person in order to set up auto pay. Cannot be done over phone!). They also have one of the cheapest monthly rates I've come across for a storage unit of this size $105/mo w/a first month $1 discount. Definitely recommend!</text>

Want to say thank you to Adrian at Public Storage...
I went to US storage ,  econo storage and found Public storage the place I want to do business with.
Adrian was helpful , kind to my situation and even made me laugh.
He made my experience a good one.
Plus the prices can't be beat .</Review>

Very unprofessional,friends storage was broken into and they are unable to give the simplest detail, important ones like what day did this happen there answer we don't no someone just noticed your lock was missing.Can I see video,no i would have to ask the general manager ok when ,Idk,I ask what's his name,not allowed to give it out.This is so shady the way this business operates.
Beware of this storage facility doesn't matter if you've been there 15 years your business means nothing to the live in management there job is to pass the blame and hide the facts why would you want your important belonging in the hands of unprofessional business tactics used to avoid any type of responsibility or should I say incrimination.These tactics our simply to delay or make your situation so unpleasant that you move on every piece of info on the site is so unhelpful since no names of authority are ever mentioned following a contact number other then a P.O BOX...
You be the judge just sharing facts.</review>

Always amazing service!! Always go out of their way to make sure I get want I need! If they don't have it in stock they order it for me ASAP and even call me to let me know it's ready!!! Highly recommend The Vape Shop for all your vape needs! The points system is an even better incentive to continue going!</Text>

Knowledgeable group of guys here.  Prices are standard fare these days.  I don't mind.  They got a good juice selection as well.  Being new up here, they recommended a bunch of food spots and venues to check out.  Thanks!

Parking is metered FYI. Pay the Curtis Jackson for 30 minutes.<//Review>

great customer service with lots of sample juice to try out from the generic tobacco flavors to the exotic tropical sensations of mango and lychee.
All of the staff over the years have been extremely knowledgeable and the newest addition to the team, Jack, is no exception.

Everyone makes you feel welcome and relaxed.  They offer a rewards club to get you to come back, a point for every dollar but the service is what i come back for each and every time.<//review>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>I was looking for Smoke shops around Hollywood LA area and I came across The Smoke Shop on Sunset Blvd. G was the guy who helped me and gotta admit he did not rush me, asked me what I wanted to get out of vape device and recommended me the ideal set up for my needs! Super professional and knowledgeable about their stuff.

Definitely one of the best smoke shops I've visited in Hollywood whether it's the customer service or just a simple atmosphere the second you walk in it feels cozy and welcoming.
G really hooked me up and assured me of any future help that I might need. The place is fairly new but you can already guess its going to be loved by their customers just because they know how to treat a guest RIGHT! You definitely want to come here to buy something than any other smoke shop in Los Angeles area.< /Text>< pictures>

Jack was EXTREMELY helpful when I came in looking for a Blu Citra Zing. I have been driving everywhere looking for it. He went online and researched and found exactly what it was and ended up recommending something not only similar but better. I ended up buying a non-disposable and I couldn’t be happier.

Jack ended up setting the device up for me and while I smoked, we talked about life and I ended up gaining not only a new vape but also a friend.

If your life’s journey happens to take you into this shop, you’ll be glad it did. Treat yourself.<//review>

Let us see never been around the area and I am dressed business casual. I asked the lad working if he had matches being a smoke shop and he rudely said no purchase I get nothing! Truthfully I was going to make a purchase until I said to myself that this is probably the worst customer service that I ever encountered! Wow in this day and age there is less to fear from outside competition than employees that give extremely bad service! I really hope this was not the owner because the guy working on 10-24-18 is a real bad employee completely unfriendly. I wanted to buy a lighter and he was flat out rude!</text>

<text>Never vaped before. Wanted to get one to smoke socially with a friend on a trip. I told the guy I had 5 minutes to purchase a vape. In those 5 minutes he gave me everything I needed to know, exactly what I wanted, and checked me out without issue. 10/10</text><username>Matt Wyatt< /username>< Time>

Very helpful. Awesome selection. I went there to buy juul pods and the guy at the counter told me about a cheaper alternative called ziip pods. He saved me like 40 bucks. Love it here!</review>

<review>Great prices, friendly staff and a clean and welcoming environment always stocked with my favorite juice !

Discounts on bottles when purchasing two so I usually kinda go nuts lol.

But really , I drive around LA a lot for work and I can usually hit all 3 of their stores in a given week;

Dean at sunset as well as Benji always make me laugh,

Alex at Hollywood is the man! Funny and knows not only Vapes but dope tricks you can do with them !

This chain really does it right. If you want something and they don't have it , they can order it and that has helped me a lot.

10 stars if I could .

Thank you guys !< /review>< UserId.>

Absolutely the worst

I was the only one in the shop walking in at 1130 on a Sunday.
The white dude with long hair that was “helping me” was completely ignoring me, like he was lost in his own mind.
I asked him a question and he said
“Here’s your receipt have a nice day!”

Never coming here again
I need to be more aware of the time. not worth the drive if you’re running low. Stock up at your “friendly” vape shop during normal Buisness hours.<//Text>

Dean was wonderful. I came in looking for a Juul, and Dean showed me the new Suorin air. I had the Juul but it’s expensive to maintain. Dean didn’t just yes me and sell me an item, he asked me about what I liked about my current device and told me the new pod systems are cheaper to maintain and can be used with your own selection of juice ! Between the store being so clean, the really cool selection of devices ( squid industries? I can’t find those anywhere, I’m coming back next paycheck for that!) kudos to the manager for hiring this guy. Any place can sell Vapes, but the mentality of all the employees here is what keeps me coming back. They don’t care about the sale, they care about the customer and for that, you’ll always get my money lol. Thank you guys for also being the kings of late night vape supplies! Google.... 10 star this place !</text>

The first time I ever came to this shop my mind was blown, the fact that it wasn't only a  vape shop.. also carried a smokeshop inside!!!! The employees were very nice and very helpful, plus can help you with any of your questions. Walked away feeling good with my products that I bought, highly recommend this place if you need anything with your vape products or your smoke essentials. Check them out please you won't be disappointed. OPEN LATE  BEST PRICESS!!!😁😁😁😁😁😎<//review>

We carry over 400 flavors ranging from Fruits, Deserts, Menthols, Tobacco, mixed fruits and many more. Our prices across the shelf are the cheaper in comparison to our competitors. We offer daily specials for our customers to save since they shop with us.\n\nAs for our staff, retail could get tricky, as much as we do our best to cater every customer at the least amount of time, sometimes many people do come in together and make it a bit more challenging to help everyone sooner.\n\nI wish to invite you back and offer you a better experience as much as we can.\nAlso, would like to offer you a bit more discount to save you more for shopping with us. Please do email us before you come so we can arrange everything.\n\nThanks for your time writing this review!"}</Resp>

{'time': 1614635004734, 'text': 'Thank you Heidi for your feedback, we are thrilled you enjoyed your massage. We are currently training new front desk staff and appreciate your patience while they are still learning. We always want you to have the best experience possible and do offer membership options to every patient that can always save you money but we do apologize for you feeling as though we were trying to upsell to you. To ensure the best health and safety precautions especially during this time we do make it a priority to clean our rooms and equipment right away after each patient, you may always ask to speak to your massage therapist if you have any questions or would like to speak with them personally. It is required for patients and staff to have their masks on at all times for the exception of the patient only when the patient is only laying facedown on the massage table for the duration of their massage. We do appreciate all criticism to help us live up to the best standards possible and thank you again for your time, we hope to see you back soon!   -Taylor, Patient Coordinator at Health & Wellness Chiropractic.'}</response>

It was clean  and the massage therapist was very nice ! They stated wouldn’t need to wear mask while getting massage. I did anyways felt more comfortable. It was a bit far for me from my location but they assisted with changing time as needed. I will say they try and “ up sell after the massage by the owner.” He was very nice just weird I didn’t get a chance to see my massage person and tip personally. Otherwise great experience !< /text>

Doctor Sembrat  is hands down the best chiropractor I have been seen by. I am a builder and need adjustment regularly. I had the opportunity to bring my lady friend in also and she was very impressed as well. We are feeling great! The Doctor is very attentive and has a unique technique.

<Review>I visited the office due to neck stiffness and shoulder pains. Upon entering the front door, I was greeted by a friendly staff. The decor was modern and welcoming.  The great variety of quality therapy equipment and service offerings were an indication of an office that takes its patients' overall health seriously.  I had a deep tissue massage on my neck, shoulders, and upper body, as well as a neck and spinal adjustment, muscle stimulator, and cryotherapy. It helped relieved the pain significantly. Will return again and recommend to others. Thank you Dr. Pham and staff.< /Review><Rating>5</Rating>< Pictures>

<review>David is an amazing massage therapist! He really helped with my lower back and knee pain. I have been having this pain for years and after the massage I had lasting relief! He is extremely knowledgeable and will explain any questions that you have regarding what he is doing.

I have had a lot of massages in the past and this was by far the best one that I have had. I will definitely be seeing him again :)</review>< pictures>

Because of a major car accident I was stressing immensely with crazy back pain. After treatments w/ Dr. Pham, I'm feeling incredibly better. He's very smart, professional, caring & knows what he's doing. I'm walking & moving more normally. The entire staff are nice & personal. The new office is spacious, very clean, & in a great location. I overall rate them all ++A, 100% satisfaction. Idk what I'd do without him.< /review>

<Review>I am a LASER engineer & an avid cyclist...bicycle commuting 100-130mi per week for fitness & to help reduce my carbon footprint on Planet Earth. Before seeing Dr Pham & Jennifer @ H&W Chiropractic, I had been suffering from an old injury for several weeks...& had nearly become an invalid, with pain in my shoulder, neck, back 24hrs a day. After only 3 weeks, I was pain-free & back to my regular lifestyle. Now at age 50, I feel stronger & more agile than I have in 10-15 years. I highly recommend seeing Dr Pham & Jennifer at Health & Wellness Chiropractic.< /Review><date>1554145310068<//date>< name>

Dr. Pham is very specific with his diagnosis and is effective in providing proper care. I have been under his care for months now and have had decreased pain and increased mobility.

His staff is professional, efficient and genuinely friendly. The office is well designed and very comfortable.

<Text>There are not too many chiropractors that I trust.  Chiropractics is one of those fields where there are a lot of shams, crooks, or quacks.  Dr Pham however is one of those chiropractors who actually takes the time to care about his patients and provides a great service.  Seriously, he's great!</Text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>After my first serious accident,  I was recommended to see a Chiropractor and after the first treatment, I felt such an intense release of pain from my back and I just felt better --mentally and physically.
My body is in a better balance and mind is clearer.

Over the course of 5 years, I've seen a handful of Chiropractors, Dr. Pham and his staff are very friendly and most accommodating to your needs and schedule. They are genuinely concerned with making sure that I was well taken care of and it shows when you step in their doorstep, they made me welcomed and answered any questions or concerns that I had.

Dr. Pham- he was very knowledgeable and with my problems and spasm that I had frequently. He gave me great tips and stretches that I could do daily to release those tension. We also came up with an comprehensive treatment plan that works with my schedule and affordable to my budget.

Highly recommended! So glad I found this office during my drive by!< /Text>< UserId.>

Of all the physicians that I have been to Dr. Pham ranks a 10 out of 10. He's a very knowledgable chiropractor and makes it a priority to make his patients feel comfortable. Dr. Pham has a relaxed and pleasant demeanor that puts one at ease immediately. He also provides alternative methods and exercises to strengthen those areas that may be plagued by chronic pain. He also listens to what you have to say with open ideas and suggestions and doesn't waver from his own experience and knowledge and he'll best prescribe his patients with the best care and professionalism money can buy. Awesome Doctor. I would recommend him to anyone I know that may be in need of a chiropractor.< /Text>

<text>After a serious back injury suffered from heavy lifting, I noticed that my lower back, body, and mind were not the same as before. Although the pain from the injury slowly subsided and went away with time, my body still did not have the range of motion it used to, and prolonged sitting and other certain movements were uncomfortable. Immediately after my first visit at the office I noticed a substantial improvement in my body: increased flexibility and lower stress levels. I simply felt better, and I think Dr. Pham might have even added an inch to my height with his moves.

The office space was beautiful and bright, creating a relaxing atmosphere. Dr. Pham is a kind and knowledgable man; he made sure that I knew what was wrong with my body, and what he was doing to help fix it. I Highly recommend a visit to his office if you are looking for spiritual and bodily healing!<//text><gmap_id>0x808fe6d4097c7d83:0x63adc5a47a01667</gmap_id><response>None<//response>< time>

<Review>I was recommended to see a chiropractor from a serious auto accident. After my first treatment, I felt such an intense relief from pain of my back. Not only did it help me feel better physically, it also put me in a better place mentally.

Dr. Pham and his staff are very friendly and most accommodating to your needs and schedule. They are genuinely concerned with making sure that I was well taken care and it shows when you step in the doorstep. They always made me feel welcomed and answered any questions or concerns that I may have.

Dr. Pham- he was very knowledgable with the issues I've had and the spasms that I had frequently. He gave me great tips and stretch techniques that I could do daily to release those tensions. He also came up with a comprehensive treatment plan that works with my schedule and affordable to my budget. I would highly recommend Dr. Pham!<//Review>< date>

I have chronic low back and neck pain almost 2 years ago from a car accident.  I went and saw few chiropractors since but was not happy with the results and outcomes as I wanted.  I still have a lot of pain after 6-9 months care from two different chiropractors.  I came to Heath and Wellness Chiropractic and was blown away by the excellent services from the front desk to the doctor himself.  Only into my third visits, I have gained mobility in my neck with no pain and able to move around a lot more in my low back.  Dr. Pham is experienced, professional and has outstanding bedside manners as well.  He is extremely compassionate, caring, humble and personal to all my needs.  He explained in details each adjustment in simple terms so that it make sense with my pain and suffering.  I am very confident with the continued care with Dr. Pham that I will get better and well at 100%. I highly recommend Dr. Pham and his staffs for chiropractic care.  He is very knowledgeable and friendly.  Thank you Dr. Pham!!!</text>

< Review>
I have always had issues with my neck and back for years and just dealt with it and got used to it over time. After my first visit with Dr. Pham I was able to feel relief in all my problematic areas.
He was very knowledgeable  and thorough with my exam. We went over my xrays together and He was able to show and explain to me the severity of my injuries Along with other underlying issues. He helped me understand the importance of preventive care. Dr pham took the time to customize care to cater to my issues instead just adjusting me and sending me on my way.
It is very apparent that Dr. Pham and everyone is his office are experts in their craft and really genuinely care for their patience health and well being. I will definitely be coming back and referring my friends and family.</Review>

Very prompt getting out for an estimate, arriving on time for the job, very friendly, great work and good value. After the crew had finished the job and sent the invoice I had some questions about some of the work that was done and Mike came out quickly to double check things and put my concerns to rest. They were great to work with!<//review>

Loveland originally quoted us an 8 week turn around time to get our roof repair done, after checking in with them and saying the leak was now causing interior damage they made an exception and came out as soon as they could. They worked with our schedule, were quick to respond to any communication, and provided me with multiple pictures of the issues they found and the fixes they did. They didn't have to go above and beyond, but they did and it is greatly appreciated.< /Review>

Zander came out, did the inspection and took care of all that I needed.  It may not have  been a big deal to him, but to my client and I it was HUGE!!!!!

Being a real estate broker in the Auburn area, I rely heavily on having a great roofing company when I need one. Mike Loveland has always been their for my clients and has responded to my requests promptly. It's been almost a year now that I remodeled my home and Loveland Roofing was called on to install the roof on my personal residence. As always, Mike and his crew did a wonderful job. They stand behind their work and are friendly and do what they say they will do. I highly recommend Loveland Roofing.<//Review>

<text>Loveland Roofing did a great job on our roof. Mike is professional and reasonable. Loveland Roofing did the roof on our house and we were so happy with the job that we called him back to do the roof on our barn. We are putting solar on our barn after re-roofing and Mike suggested integrating the solar mounts while roofing to make a cleaner appearance and a better seal.< /text><Rating>5</Rating><UserId.>107489196623388490218</UserId.><pics>None</pics><Response>None</Response><user_name>Basil Alfaqih< /user_name></record></dataset><record>

Loveland Roofing is easy to work with and very affordable. I used them on a rental property I have in Elk Grove that had a tile roof with multiple tiles cracked. Mike came down the day after I called him and gave me a very affordable estimate. Mike was able to get the job scheduled for later that week and he even sent photos when it was completed. Loveland Roofing is one of the best in the business we appreciate their services!<//text>

Mike and Jon Loveland do a great job and are easy to reach. They respond within 24 hrs. (I know when they are at a job site they can't respond right away, but never go past 24 hrs.).  They do honest work and have generally beaten competitors bids.  They are my "go to" for roof work and I have referred them to several people in my sphere as well.< /review>

I previously used a another roofing contractor. I was referred to Loveland by another real estate agent who had nothing but good things to say. After doing my own diligence I saw they have a great track record. I concur 100% in our first business dealing they saved the day. I highly recommend them.</Review>

As a realtor I require roofing services (repairs and replacements) on a regular basis and have used different roofers over the years. NO ONE is as reliable, fair in their pricing or skilled at their trade as Mike Loveland, at Loveland Roofing is. All I can say is thank you for your attention to detail and always doing such a great job for me and my clients.</review>

Loveland Roofing and Mike the owner are great. He has done a new roof at two of our homes. He does quality work and the lowest price we found. He is honest and fixes any problems that may arise. He even drove 2 hours from his service area to bid and replace a roof for our vacation home.  Now that is service above and beyond.</text>

Owner seemed like a nice guy during the initial meet but basically no other communication until he emailed the $825 bill. Not even a heads up before the morning his son showed up a few weeks after our initial meeting. Pretty random scheduling, good thing I was home that day I guess. He sent 1 person,  his son, to do my tile roof inspection/repair. Used a leaf blower to blow out my gutter, not sure what else he accomplished in the 45 mins he spent on my roof.  Didn't offer any report or follow up info.  Did I mention this cost me $825?  And, he cracked a roof tile in the process. Had to call them back to fix that.  Never heard from the owner again, until this sudden request today to review his company. I'll use another roofer next time. I would have kept this to myself but you asked.<//text><pics>None< /pics><response>{'time': 1564608386307, 'text': 'Mr Clark, thank you for your response.

<Time>1564535246673< /Time><Text>Loveland Roofing is a fantastic family owned business.  I discovered Loveland Roofing last winter when I had a client who needed to have a new roof done quickly in order to close on the sale of their home.  Loveland Roofing was able to get the job done quickly and a little below budget.  Since that experience I have requested bids for many other clients and they always come through.  Repairs or a new roof - they do a great job and are always competitively priced.  It's nice to have a business I feel confident recommending to all my clients, friends and family.  Thank you Loveland Roofing!  You are fantastic to work with!

Mike Loveland is a class act gentleman and his company does a great job. I'm in Real Estate and lots of times I've had to call Mike on a rush inspection and he always comes through for me. Most all of my clients have picked him to be the one for their re roof when needed and I've never heard any complaints!</Text>

We referred to Loveland Roofing from a friend who had used them for a repair and they were very professional. They fixed the leak in our roof that was caused by storm damage. Our insurance company sent out a different roofing company and after meeting the other company we decided to shop around. It’s tough finding an honest company especially to work on your home. I would recommend Loveland for any of my families roofing needs.<//text>

I am a property manager and realtor. I have used Mike for over 20 years.
He has fair prices and does a beautiful job. He gets busy so you may have to wait for him but he is worth it. He is loyal and will always return if something is not right. I would recommend him to anyone that asked me for a referral for a roofing contractor.< /Review>

The company went out to my house in Nevada City to look at a repair that needed to happen. The technician didn’t even go up on the roof but just inspected from the deck. He couldn’t possibly see the skylights from there. There had been a carpenter ant infestation which I had taken care of and now needed the roof fixed around the skylights. I called him and texted him multiple times but he never returned my calls or texts. Very disappointed.< /review>

We had Mike Loveland’s Roofing repair our roof after we had our house painted. The painter moved the tiles and didn’t put them back correctly. They also cleaned the valleys where the roof had some overflow and leaked. His son and his wife did a great job!! I would highly recommend this company ☺️<//review>

<Review>I had Loveland Roofing come to my house because some tiles had fallen off and need to be put back on and had to replace ones that was broken. They did a great job I couldn’t even tell which ones they replaced. They got here when they said they would and the price was very fair. They even checked the rest of my tiles to make sure that they were good.<//Review>< Time>

Loveland Roofing from Jacob to the office to the owner Mike were recommended to me 3 years ago by a respected Lyon agent from my office. It's difficult to get an appointment with Loveland because they are so busy all year long. This is because everyone I work with recommends them.  Loveland has gone way out of their way to help 2 of my real estate clients. Way above what any other roofer let alone contractors has done for my clients. This is why I refer Loveland to all my clients and to other agents and friends. I will not make a recommendation unless I'm sure they will make me look good for recommending them.  A competitor roofer did a roof inspection Loveland had already inspected and repaired. The other company said $1800 was needed in additional repairs and there was no roof Cert. there was a roof cert and Loveland told me he's take that other report, compare it to the repairs and cleaning he had already done and stand by his roof Cert. Mike Loveland did exactly that and found there was nothing additional needed to be done on the roof. What else can I say but forget their competitors and call Loveland.<//review>

So we moved to Newcastle several years ago & our Real Estate guy Rocky referred us to Mike Loveland. We needed a complete roof tear off & redo. We met with 4 roofers & got bids. One of the roofers we had used for a few roofs over the years. Well dang, Mike just lived down the street from us & his kindness really hit home to us. Now, I am pretty picky & had a specific list of materials I wanted & things I wished installed. Here it is, Mike was so easy to deal with, very attentive, very friendly, and communicated greatly. So, yea we went with him. His crew did a great job. Now here is the kicker as to why Mike Loveland roofing is the way to go. Yes you see some complaints on here but I tell you there is no way they are telling the truth & giving the whole story. Well Mikes crew cleaned great, but not enough for my OCD & I called. Mike himself came right over & cleaned meticulously all around the house. Oh, I forgot his crew forgot to install my ridge vent in a few places and of course his crew was over like instantly & fixed it quickly & greatly.  They forgot since roof vents were normally not put where I wanted extra. You know when it comes to construction & mistakes or something forgotten or communication most people suck. Not Mike! Our solar company wreaked our new roof by Mike. He was way overboard in helping us with getting the "Solar City" company to pay for Mike to fix there catastrophe. Hell yes, go Mike. This guy even welcomed us into his home years later & bought tamales from our kid and started calling his friends right then telling them all he was sending is over and to buy tamales. You rocked Mike. Thanks.....</Text>

I have used loveland roofing company twice and one time for my client.  Both times I had multiple bids but loveland gave my the best price and service.  I have called him with  issues on my investment properties a few times- he follows through and i consider him very dependable - as i do not have time to meet them on site or call repeatedly.  I am an investor and a realtor - i will use him on my next purchase - i wish he can expand his expertise to take care of the entire rehab project.  I am very pleased with the quality of his work as I am told by other contractors who have worked on the property.</Text>

<rating>1<//rating><Text>Terrible. Messy. Unprofessional. Terrible communication. They left trash, food wrappers, nails, broken tool boxes, extension cords out, ladders leaning precariously at the end of a work day. They should have cleaned up after themselves at the end of each day, put away tools and extensions cords (instead of leaving them where people could trip over them), and placed ladders on the ground, not left where my kids could have:
1.) Climbed up them
2. )Knocked them over.
The worst was that they left a trailer in front of my garage for a week. They left one day, and didn't come back for a week. They didn't answer the phones in their office nor return phone calls. We could not access our garage for a week. This was not ok, not professional, and definitely not courteous.
Once the rains started, we had a large leak in our skylight. It took them 5 weeks to come out and fix the leak. It was not a small leak either. It was very large.
Very poor follow through.< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< UserId.>

Great brunch! The staff is so friendly and the food is top notch. It may be a bit pricey but it is totally worth it. It is also a great location to walk to museums after a nice meal.< /review>

< Review>
Best hotel in LA county. I would never consider staying elsewhere. Location is ideal, corner of PCH and Hwy 110. You can explore the entire city, including the fabulous beaches, using this BW as a home base. Parking is sheltered, secure and free! The staff keeps the property immaculate (muchas gracias Laura) and they give valuable advice regarding traffic and tourist destinations. Check-in with Lorena was efficient and check-out with Alma was super smooth. Everything in between was wonderful. Thanks again for another delightful stay!</Review>

Dear all,
Nice hotel, but sometime not for beginners. Most of the important services are present: onsite parking, coin laundry machines and functional rooms. Breakfast wasn't available but the restaurant is literally next to the hotel.

Housekeepers does a great job with the rooms, but some sort of remodel should take place in the common areas.</text>

<Review>My family stayed at this affordable hotel, and I was not mistaken about choosing this hotel because all we need was all intact. The services they provided were competitive despite their lower cost compared to other hotels out there. I'll be giving this hotel a "5" stars for providing me genuine and outstanding assistance. The best place to stay with family.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None</response><GmapID>0x80dd35ecb90c03f3:0x355740521da101e2< /GmapID></record>

<Review>Man in front office lied and said they don't accept cash only credit. Then have us stand in the lobby for 10 minutes while they change shifts & the next guy says the can all a sudden. Obviously, they don't accommodate their out of town guest much at all. Don't know if I will ever be returning again over this scrutiny.< /Review>< Pictures>

Price was fair and very friendly! The rooms are very spacious and clean. Had all the amenities: wifi/cable TV/fridge/microwave/very generous amount of storage space and closet space. Cons: No free breakfast due to covid-19. Parking is tight and location is at an awkward area when entering the property and exiting. Can be dangerous but overall it was near fastfood, freeway, gas station, stores.<//Text>

Clean, comfortable hotel.  Morning breakfast has a nice variety of food.  Staff are friendly and helpful.  We stay here the night before we leave on a cruise, parking is free for a week, then it's $10 a day after.  Highly recommend this hotel.< /review>

The neighborhood is in armpit traffic like New York City can be very difficult pulling out into traffic but the buildings kept in pretty good shape and for about a hundred bucks a night in a check out time of 12:00 noon or thereafter if you choose it's a pretty good deal is the Denny's next door open 24 hours and other convenience stores and fast food nearby it's directly off the 110 freeway at Pacific Coast Highway so that can be advantageous</Text>

<Review>Hotel room was in great shape and newly updated. The whole hotel is older, but their renovations help keep it looking new and modern. Only downfall is it’s right by the freeway but they are so kind to provide you with ear plugs. We didn’t need them, wasn’t that bad/loud. Breakfast was nothing spectacular at all-go to Denny’s next door.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><UserId.>117355769715589641500<//UserId.></record>

< Review>
The hotel was easy to access, and had it's own parking structure on the same property as the hotel. The room itself was very clean and spacious. Had a great selection of TV channels and had a nice laminated TV channel guide, for channel navigation. Refrigerator and microwave were clean. Had a hair dryer in the room, and the beds were very comfortable. I enjoyed being there. We paid for a room/breakfast. But they werent serving breakfast because of Covid. Being able to book a room and breakfast, but not getting a breakfast during this time, I believe, was Booking.coms fault. Otherwise, our whole experience there was great.<//Review>

So this hotel is more like in the industrial side in town. When we arrived to the hotel we noticed that there were a lot of homeless people around the hotel, we checked in and we started noticing that a lot of homeless people were staying in the hotel. At night it was hard to get some rest because the rest of the rooms sounded like they had parties really loud I would not recommend stay in there I can’t see how this hotel has 3 1/2 stars. The AC did not work The meaning refrigerator didn’t either the hallways to the hotel where hotter then outside< /Text>

Had business in So Cal so stayed two nights. Very impressed by staff, facilities and amenities. Everything worked well so no complaints. 24 hr Dennys next door is very convenient. Lots of parking.  Easy access to 110 freeway. Will definitely stay there again if I have business in the area.<//Review>

Nice small hotel. 4 floors. Nice room, but it's no holiday Inn. Rooms felt bigger, or maybe it's just the one I was in. Cool place. Awfully or conveniently close to the 110, too!< /text>

<review>The entire staff including house keeping was filled with smiles, generosity, warm hearts, kindness, caring and respect. Especially the front desk staff! Rooms were very well taken care of with FREE cleaning everyday regardless of how long your there. Pool and hot tub were located on sight outside. Beds were relaxing but not the greatest. The continental breakfast tho is a must offering waffles, eggs, sausage, bagels, toast, oatmeal, cereal, yogurt, juices, hot tea, milk, and coffee. This is THE place to stay for the price you PAY!!!</review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Our stay at this location was very pleasant. The place was clean and our unit was up to date. The breakfast was great with everything that one can expect from a  buffet style self serve service. The crew is very welcoming and make every effort to make feel important and comfortable . There is also a vending machine , and laundry area for the guest in case that they require to refresh their clothes...prices are $1.75 for wash load, $1.50 drier...way less that a regular laundry mat. We are very pleased with our experience at this hotel.<//Text>

<Review>Yasmin was fantastic! Her friendliness and attention to detail was outstanding. I was the first to enter the dinning area when breakfast opened. No only was she attentive (asking if I needed anything etc.), but I noticed how she would continue to work to keep the dinning area just as sparkling as it was when I got there. She would wipe up small splashes or spills behind the guests as soon as they occurred. And would greet and engage them as well when they entered. I truly felt more like I was eating breakfast at a friends house then out on the road! I travel often for both work and pleasure, and I must say that she is head and shoulders above the rest! You guys have got something here, do your best to keep her!</Review>< Gmap_id>

<Text>Rooms were nice and large. Overall clean hotel. Great breakfast offered.
Maid service was very lacking, would not clean rooms, or replace towels/soaps/empty trash/make beds. We had to ask twice for maid service.
The front desk was very helpful and service oriented.<//Text>< GmapID>

This is a very nice hotel with all the amenities you would expect. It is right off the 110 freeway and within minutes to Long Beach terminal where we were going on a cruise ship. They also allow you to park your vehicle at the hotel while you’re on the cruise at no additional charge. Thank you very much management.<//Review>

Very close to the San Pedro Port so we spent our pre-boarding night for a beautiful Princess Cruise here [with FREE parking for 7 nights...$100+ less than at all other equal local hotels].  Best All??  Staff Members Gilbert and Pamela were extremely warm, helpful  good representatives for large hotel chain.</Text>< response>

The front desk agent that I spoke to on 06/11/18 was very polite and professional. The rooms are clean and neat each night that I return to retire for the night. The room service is amazing, none of my items were ever moved from where I left them. Nothing came up missing either. I still have 2 nights to go, but so far so good. I would recommend this place for sure and would stay again if I'm ever back in LA.<//Review>< pictures>

Rooms were reasonably comfortable but not in the best repair. Front desk discounted our bill by $15 for the inconvenience of not having a locking bathroom door. Housekeeping was less than stellar, and asked if we needed maid service at 4:30 in the afternoon. Probably would pay a little more next time to stay somewhere else.<//review>

There were no noisy neighbors and there was a little debris from the remodelling outside the rooms but other than that, it was fine. The employees were all very friendly and I met a security guard early in the morning who explained that he would be patrolling the outskirts of the hotel from 10 to 6 to keep out solicitors or other disturbances outside the hotel. The breakfast was very good and the place had the items neatly placed. Overall, I loved it. Thank you.< /Review>< Pictures>

<review>Not sure where to start. I arrived late, checked in. That went fine. I noticed that the lobby and elevator where more dirty than is typical in a hotel lobby. I shrugged it off and headed to my room, only to find what looked like a blood stain the size of a fist awaiting inside my door.
I'd needed to pee since I left the airport an hour ago, so I rushed into the bathroom and found 3 cockroaches staring at me. I quickly killed these, and flipped my mattresses to check for other creepy crawlies. Thankfully I've found none.
The next morning, as I was taking a shower, I looked up and noticed 2 areas of black mold.
I'm still here for work the next 25 days and am not sure if I should ask for another room or just go to another hotel.
This hotel is a really nice 4 min from where I'm working, so it's kinda a hard decision.<//review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x80dd35ecb90c03f3:0x355740521da101e2</Gmap_id></record>

About 3.5 stars but still highly recommended. You can't beat their generous extended parking policy if you're going on a cruise nearby. The room was very nicely modernized and had plenty of amenities (TV, microwave, mini fridge, coffee maker, iron, comfy chair, desk, etc), albeit some of those things are a little clunky.  Our tub didn't hold water well and the key card lock was tricky.  It is true that the walls are paper thin so you will hear everyone and everything. Their Continental breakfast was VERY well stocked and delicious. Staff was generally friendly.  Despite a few hiccups, I recommend this hotel to anyone on a budget looking for a nice place.<//review>

<review>Sadly, our room reeked of animal urine. Very obviously there had been a dog lo led in the bathroom. There were significant painted over dog scratch marks inside the door and it was just overwhelming. Even with the bathroom door closed you could smell it in the room. I like to leave positive reviews,  but when I notified the girl at the desk, she just smiled and said, "thank you ".< /review>< pictures>

I stay at this hotel whenever I fly in on business. Clean, well-maintained rooms, very nice hot breakfast, pleasant staff. There's a Denny's right next door.

WiFi is adequate: my room tested out at a consistent 7-10 mbits/sec, plenty fast for email, browsing and some streaming video. The password worked on multiple devices simultaneously which was great.

Parking is a bit tight but workable.

My only real complaint has nothing to do with the hotel itself, but that it is in a very noisy area. Trucks, horns, sirens and loud motorcycles until the weekend hours of the morning. You know your in for it when the maids leave a couple pairs of foam earplugs on the dresser.< /text>

The room I stayed in was on the 3rd floor and looked to the back of the hotel.  It was very quiet, breakfast was fine with some hot selections and the hotel is right next to a Denny's where we had a good dinner.
Wifi was free and fairly fast.  TV had my favorite station, Discovery Channel.< /review><Date>1555286379630<//Date></record></dataset><record>

<Response>None</Response><rate>4<//rate><Review>This is a standard Best Western with comfortable rooms. The advantage here is the cruise parking policy. We were on a 19-day Panama Canal cruise and parked our car free for 14 days with an additional 5 days for $10 per day. A huge savings over parking at the terminal. A Best Western employee explained the policy incorrectly at first, and another cruise passenger staying at the hotel mentioned the actual policy, which the desk person verified. The front desk person also called a taxi for us to take us to the cruise terminal. All-in-all an outstanding offer from this Best Western for anyone on a cruise.<//Review><user_id>117569266184483713304<//user_id>< pictures>

<text>The hotel itself is very nice but the area around it is a bit dodgy. The room was clean and well presented. The TV in my room had a nasty habit of making this loud buzzing sound as if electrically shorting out.  Irritating. The continental breakfast was standard for Best Western hotels. I stay at Best Western hotels because they have common standards wherever they are located.<//text><pics>None</pics><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

<Text>The check in process was easy. However, when returning to the room around 9 pm the elevators were down. My 7 year old and  my senior mother had to take the stairs. We were placed on the 4th floor and there were no other options. This was a huge inconvenience. The breakfast was nice.  There were no large towels placed in our room and no microwave.The room was decent and clean.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None</response>< GmapID>

This review is base in the dates from 12/28/18 to 12/30/18 in room 424:

Pros:
-Fast and easy check-in
-Friendly hotel staffs
-Clean room

Cons:
-Bed bugs: I was woken up around 4am with very intense itch. It was 4 small red bites align next to each other (the manager insist that its spider bites, which I would be in the emergency room if that’s the case!). It’s been almost a week and the itch has not subside and the bites are still there.
I got some trash bags to put our belongings in so I don’t transport those bedbugs to my home!

-Manager John: The employees was expecting him to be here at 10:30am but he was late... has no compassion that we didn’t get much  sleep and had to drive 5 hours back home!
He has no people skills, very rude and looks like he hates his job.
He offer to give me 30% for one day stay:
For what?!
1) The risk of getting those bugs to my house?
2) The lack of sleep the night prior?!
3) Super itchy bite marks that won’t go away?!
I DID NOT PAY TO GET BITE AND NO DAMN SLEEP!
Damn inconsiderate fool!

- Thin walls
- Fire alarm is detached from the ceilings and just hanging on to dear life.

For the past few years Best Western has been the only hotel I stay whenever I travel and this hotel is by far the worst.

You been warned, stay at your own risk!

Good rates per night and excellent location to stay compared to other sites throughout the city. Check-in staff was very friendly and even more helpful with me and my friends the next morning when guiding us to the breakfast lounge. Rooms and beds were very clean and serviced nicely both mornings while we were away. Television and free wifi made the stay more comfortable and the buildings location was easily accessible from the street. This place will be a definite go-to spot whenever we come back.</text>

<review>Had a great stay, Lovely Motel. -  However, we had a long drive over on Friday, and went to bed early.  Was awoken at midnight by first a phone call, which stopped before I could answer it, and then by someone banging on my door stating that I had parked in a Handicap space with no sticker.  I told him to go out and look at the License plate and quit disturbing me.  His name was Richard and he worked for" iSecure", the patrol people hired by Best Western.  He was an idiot, but unfortunately I was unable to get back to sleep and have asked for a one night credit because of it.<//review>< Pictures>

Nice room, good shower. Wonderful breakfast layout and offerings. Best hotel waffle I had in a long time. There is a serious lack of outlets in the room. I may have to start packing a surge protector/power strip as this is common.<//Text>

The room is clean and beds are comfy. The only things I didn't like are not enough outlet in the room, not enough channels to watch, breakfast needs more flavor and just need to add bacon or sausage but other than that room smells clean, staff are friendly and you will sleep good at this hotel. Definitely will recommend this place.<//Text>

Good big rooms. Clean facilities, decent breakfast. Nice pool and hot tub. Slight shame the pool isn't heated, there's no change facilities and they don't want you to use the lift after, you have to climb the stairs to your room.< /review>

Great place to stay! Staff are always friendly and smiling. Great breakfast and lots of things to chose from to eat. Nice clean spacious room. Well furnished and huge bed. Wifi was fast. Location could be better as its next to a noisy street. But overall great experience</Text>

House keepers were indeed very helpful. The rest of the staff was lazy, and NO where to be found. The entire 3rd floor was under major construction all day & night. Asbestos dust all over us. Huge boxes and materials blocked our door way. Plus loud vulgar words the workers chose to use. Loud Spanish music echoed throughout the unsafe hallway. We spent way to much $money$ inna place where we got NO SLEEP! IM NOT HAPPY!</Review>

<text>We stayed at the Best Western Worldport for a couple of reasons. The price was right and it was close to our destination in San Pedro. The hotel itself is pretty much like any other of its kind. The one downside is the proximity to lots of automobile noise as it is at the intersection of the Pacific Coast Highway and SR 110. There is a 7-11 across the street if you need anything simple, though, and it is fairly convenient in terms of getting to the beach or to San Pedro.< /text><rate>None< /rate><Date>1442188800000<//Date>< Resp>

Has marijuana smell in elevator and throughout hallways.no grass area for service animal.also Dilbert the Gilbert at front desk seemed a little to rude for hospitality at check in he did not want to accommodate me was displeased with his attitude</review>

Very loud traffic noise all night.  Windows and walls are thin and don't filter out much of this noise.  They do provide ear plugs in the rooms, so this is a known issue.  Otherwise, this is a clean and nice hotel with decent breakfast with friendly staff.</text>

Location was convenient & that's about it. Asked for extra towels, received them & housekeeping took them away. Therefore had to get more towels during stay. Housekeeping took all day to clean room. At 3pm, room still wasn't clean. Toilet broken, but it was fixed by the time we returned to room.<//review>

Four of us stayed at this hotel before and after our cruise.  We were pleased with the amenities and the proximity to the port and airport. Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone leaving on a cruise from the port. They have underground parking and allow vehicles to be parked there.</text>

It's too bad  several of us from our Union wanted to rent a room at Best Western in Wilmington California off of Pacific Coast Highway, for a week we were told that it would be $99 for the first three nights, the fourth night would be a hundred and nineteen and the fifth night would be 139.00 and it just keeps going up. It's too bad they lost out on a lot of money. We are working people from out of town, I guess that means nothing no more!<//text>

We stayed for 1 night before boarding our Cruise.  The property is not bad, parking is a bit narrow - so beware if you drive a big suv.  Staff not very friendly, but not rude. Just kind of blah.  Our room, while very clean, needed serious updating.  Beds were very bouncy, decor and fixtures old.  A/C worked well but was quite loud.</Text>

I wouldn't even give this 1 star!! It was infested with roaches!! I Complained to the manager John as soon as we got into our room and seen it crawling on the wall, showed them pictures and he stated they have been having the problem for awhile now and have an exterminator come spray every 2 weeks.  The next morning found another roach in the breakfast area by the waffle maker. When we showed the employee working, she said "I'm so sorry, we can't seem to get rid of them" She then switched out the waffle maker.. my family left immediately feeling so gross to our stomachs! The manager said he could only offer us a 30% discount, but after we left we have not heard from him again. And Expedia who we reserved our room through cannot get in contact with him now either! Worse experience ever!!</Text>

I have slept in better hotels in Mexico than here. Should be more like a $20 a night instead of the rate they are charging!<//Review>< rating>

<Time>1343779200000<//Time><rating>None< /rating><Review>Well, when I reached after a five hour long flight at 8 am in the morning...I got to know that the check in the room was only going to be for 2 o clock in the afternoon. I was so tired and was with my family. I sat on the disgusting sofa that they provided. The receptionist was quite rude to talk to. Once I reached the room..I wanted 2 non smoking rooms..and to my surprise..the entire floor smelled of smoke. The bathrooms were not so great...And the continental breakfast was absolutely rubbish.There were flies in the muffin tray. The waffle maker got spoilt. Sharp 10 o clock they would start removing the breakfast spread(hardly a spread) without even considering that the guests were still eating. Majority of the staff was very rude and impolite.I would suggest you NOT to stay in this one my friend.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

Very dated facilities, paper thin walls. Terrible parking situation unless you're driving a tiny car. Don't plan on making a left-handed turn on PCH... If you don't mind these things the staff is super nice.</Review>

<Review>Good value for the money (paid $110/night on the weekend), given the proximity to and hotel prices in Long Beach.  Breakfast was typical continental style, limited seating.  Pool and hot tub were open and the water was clear.  Parking is a bit cramped and inconveniently situated.  Shower water was hot and room was clean with no odors.< /Review>< Name>

I don't care for the location. I asked for a roll away bed and microwave they didn't have it. The parking is horrible, the forth floor is hot and my room smelled like a man lives there. Also my TV didn't work and the breakfast had mold in my yogurt. The elevator had  graffiti In it so that what make me think the area is not that good. The one good thing I can say I will not return  and the staff and nice personalities .</Review>

<Time>1533085393673</Time><pics>None</pics><text>Very nice hotel for the price, staff friendly and polite, room clean and well-maintained. King size bed which, as a tall person, I very much appreciated. Room has no microwave, but does have a refrigerator. Full breakfast available though (I had eggs and sausage, and some pretty decent coffee.) Beats the usual "Continental Breakfast" of fruit and granola bars. One very positive feature is solid Wi-Fi. For a hotel network it's great: it tested out at 23 mbit/sec down, 25 mbit/sec up, and I was able to run Duo, Hangouts, Netflix, Skype and Plex with no issues. Very happy with that. The only complaint I have is that my room (I'm sitting in it as I write this) has very few electrical outlets. If you're someone like me that has a lot of electronics, bring a power strip. That's not enough for me to dock them a star though, as I'm having a very pleasant experience.<//text>< rating>

For cruise travelers, particularly from/to San Pedro Port, the hotel is at a prime location. Rather than pay for parking at the port for the duration of a four plus night cruise, staying one night is more than worth a nightly rate with inclusive parking. The beds are sufficiently comfortable, though the pillows are European square and quite thick with cotton, so you may prefer your more traditional American feathery rectangle pillow or the bosum of your lover. Just kidding. But not really. Anyways, the parking for your cruise or otherwise, is quite excellent and safe... Safe enough for my Tesla. If I owned one, but I don't. But it should still say something. The TV had about 25 channels, lots of them in Espanol, and lots of them fuzzy. Eat at the Baja fish place nearby, not many more options, and an excellent one. We had no notable experience with service so cannot give more than five stars. Would stay again for a future cruise and update thereafter. Love you< /text>

Semi hard to get to durring peak traffick times. Staff is nice. Water running through pipes is loud enough to wake a light sleeper. Walls are thin enough you can almost make out conversations in the next room. Cable is lacking and half the channels dont come in well.<//review>

< review>
I came here because our original plans fell through for accommodation and things book out quick and I was in a wedding so it just needed to be close to the venue but not super pricey being as we had a lot to do and I needed several days.
It is right off the free way however it's a left turn on a very busy road so I just went to the light ever time maybe in the off season you can make a left with out waiting forever.  But that wasn't to bug of a deal.   It isn't in the best neighborhood so I would not leave anything in your car that is visible that being said.  It has a good lit up parking lot which is nice.   Bring wish clothes I don't know if they had a shortage or what I have really long hair so usually need a towel for my hair and body yeah they are really stingy about that.  They also for two people gave us one wash cloth and one hand towel.  Was kind of annoying.  Even when we asked for them.  Fortunately I brought beach towels so we made it work.  They do have a pool and hot tub it's small but fine the ph was off by alot though it was super foggy and not very clean.  We noticed the same garbage was left on the tables and ground everyday and accumulating.   The room was fairly clean.  Not as clean as I would have liked but not to the point that we felt the need to leave just wear slippers your feet will be instantly black.  We also had to  wiped things down ourselves.   They had breakfast it was typical what you would expect only bummer is the eggs were ice cold so I don't know what happened there.  So I guess I would say If you just need a place to sleep this place will do we didn't have much time to spend here anyways which was for the best.  All in all I wouldn't stay here again for the price I wish I had picked the other place but it wasn't the worse either.  I am not sure why it has the reviews it has but I'm it's fine.<//review>

<text>Have been staying here for 2 nights so far and have 2 nights to go. I have requested on 3 occasions to have the TV fixed or replaced in our room. It keeps turning itself off several times in an hour and is obviously faulty. Surely we could get a replacement.<//text>< pics>

We stayed at this hotel from Dec. 31/16-Jan. 2/17.  Location was great for the area.  Staff were friendly.  Check in-out were painless, they even let us check -in 1 hour earlier because the rooms were ready.  We didn't get the rollaway bed we requested, however, the staff gladly equipped us with extra sheets and blankets to make a comfortable bed on the floor for the 5th person in our room.  We were even able to enjoy the fireworks from our rooms on New Years Eve.  Close to the Harbour at Long Beach for the Fire Works and the Whale watching and Pacific Aquarium.  Breakfast was OK.  The usual Waffle maker, bagels, mini muffins, danishes, yoghurt, cold boiled eggs.  No hot items.  Also surprisingly, they didn't have any tea bags int he room, and only had Lipton Orange Pekoe in the breakfast room.  Pool was under renovation.  Wi-Fi works great most of the time.  Limited TV channels but who cares because we didn't come to watch TV.< /review>

The price was $80 for two beds, which is about average but the beds were nice to sleep in. They had newspapers for free, the room was large, the front desk help was a small young spanish speaking girl that was annoyed that I was there interrupting her texting or cell phone activity. She treated me like an annoyance rather than important. The heater in my room was difficult to get working, it was disfunctional. There are not rooms on the first floor, they are all 2nd and 3rd floor rooms, you have to take the elevator. It is next to a freeway intersection and so it is very noisy in the front rooms, if I stayed there again, and I may, I would pick a back room away from the street. Over all, it was just ok!< /Text>

Two people were in my room when I walked in--I was told they were plumbers (really? Older Asian couple? With no tools?); changed rooms because a/c wasn't working well; sand in the sink in new room; remote wouldn't turn on TV; ladder left in the hallway; power went out in the middle of the night with no room emergency lighting (and phone didn't work)</text>

(Translated by Google) Good hotel, good breakfasts, there is a cafe nearby where you can have a snack in the evening, ample parking. Of the minuses, the noisy air conditioners are internal (they freeze well) and there is a relatively noisy road nearby, but it was normal for us

(Translated by Google) Very good hotel Clean, friendly and for a reasonable price, if we consider it to be a tourist area. The person at the reception very friendly and talkative, makes you feel like family. And the breakfast is rich and with a lot of variety, and the people who attend it are very kind and helpful. Thank you. In general I liked it a lot. And the price is very reasonable. I told my husband, when we return for those directions, we have to book hotel.

Muy buen hotel. Limpio, agradable y por un precio razonable, si consideramos que es zona turística.  La persona de recepción muy amable y platicador, te hace sentir en familia. Y el desayuno es rico y con mucha variedad, y las personas que lo atienden muy amables y serviciales.  Gracias.  En general me gustó mucho.  Y el precio es muy razonable.  Le dije a mi esposo,  cuando volvamos para esos rumbos, ya tenemos que hotel reservar.<//text>

<Text>El hotel es viejo y la zona donde esta es fea y alejada de todo, no volvería una muy mala opción, por equivocación reserve en una habitación para fumadores pedí q la cambiaran y no lo hicieron. Nada recomendable. El desayuno muy sencillo. Nada de este hotel me gusto.< /Text><pics>None</pics>< response>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Good price but I would not go back.
The fourth no smoking smelled like cigarettes.
At breakfast that is from 7am to 10am at 9:10 am there was no egg and the girl who was in charge was kind and slow to respond to the shortages.

(Original)
Buen precio pero no volveria.
El cuarto no smoking olia a cigarro.
En el desayuno que es de 7am a 10am a las 9:10 am ya no Habia huevo y la chica q estaba a cargo poco amable y lenta para responder a los faltantes.< /Text>< pics>
