<user_id>117800810006792070934<//user_id><rating>5</rating><Text>I have recently moved to the area from Los Angeles and was looking for a new vet to take my cats to. My first visit was great! Took my kitty who was experiencing an infection of some kind and they got it all sorted out and issued medicine to take home. They emailed invoice receipts and gave pamphlets on the medicine and their usage as well as in general cat care etc.. A big plus as well is my cat did not seem scared or traumatized whatsoever when I picked her up so they must have been kind and sweet to her because she's a timid cat for sure. I have found my new vet and will be taking my cats here in the future.< /Text><Name>Gabriel Campiran<//Name><Pictures>None</Pictures></record></dataset><record>

<rate>5<//rate><text>Our poor baby Zoey (Mini Dachshund) came down with a rare immune disorder called IMHA, where her red blood cells were being destroyed by her own body. Dr. Moore and team were quick to identify the issue and give Zoey the best possible fighting chance for this terrible disease.

As heart breaking as it was to watch our little Zozo wasn't able to beat this disease and God took her gentle soul home on 4/1/2021. Dr. Moore gave us the gift of exhausting medical science and knowing we did everything we could to save our dog; her genuine empathy, kindness, love for our pet, and support will never be forgotten.

Rest in peace our sweet girl.< /text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMEhSRZxpptKofPz0NL3CAx07xTZbEFI7pZVbEf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x808fb61443b7c4ff:0x842ef3962b716839<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Wonderful!
I finally got fed up with my vet and joined Pet's Friend Animal Clinic. What a breath of fresh air!
My dog needed to be seen right away, and my previous vet said they could see her in a week. That was unacceptable.
Pet's Friend found a way to see my dog the same day, despite the fact that I was not yet a member! All of my dog's records were transfered to Pet's Friend within the hour.
I also have 2 friends who speak highly of this clinic.
I am relieved that my dog is now in capable and loving hands.<//Text>

Soon after moving to California, my little poodle found himself in a bit of trouble with a major cut on his foot. He required emergency surgery to stitch it all back together. The vets a Pet's Friend Animal Clinic were wonderful and amazing through the entire situation. They gave him such love and attention when we came into the clinic and were great helping to meet his pain needs.

I stopped in one morning to pick up some medication and talked with Dr. Miller. I told her he wasn't feeling very good and she immediately cleared her schedule and had me bring him in. She did a full examination, ran tests, and prescribed medications to get him up and running. He's been feeling great.

I am so thankful for the care provided by the vets here (we've seen all of them and they are all great). The front desk staff are all so friendly and return calls/questions in a timely manner. If you're looking for a new vet, I highly recommend this clinic. Thanks for all you do!</Review>

Have been here several times for my cat in the past few years, mostly for regular check ups. Now that he developed a condition, I was happy with how friendly, professional, and caring the staff is. They do take time to explain everything and are concern for the well being of your pet.</review>

While the COVID-19 pandemic rendered our first visit to be in the car while the pup went inside, I really couldn't be more impressed with this practice so far. Even before getting our Siberian Husky, the staff at Pet's Friend were so helpful in suggesting several resources to aid my and my partners learning, resources on environmental considerations, and small businesses we can support should we need training and boarding.

This clinic is really outstanding and I'd encourage you to call them to learn more if you are on the market for a new Vet.</Text>

<review>Worst customer experience ever! I called the office to make the appointment for today and got confirmed. And then when I came to the office today, I was told that they could not find my appointment and they could do nothing about it! I need to do the health check for my cat today or tomorrow in order to get insurance for her (I bought insurance from healthy paws two weeks ago and it needs health check to be activated). But I was told the earliest date is the end of Jan and they could not make any exception even if they made mistake!<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

I have only been here once so far, but it was overwhelmingly positive. The front desk staff was friendly when I called to make the appointment, and I love that I could email any records to them ahead of time. They have a nice set-up for visits during COVID, and it all ran very smoothly. The doctor (Allison Moore) was so friendly, sweet, and knowledgeable; she even looked up a study while we were talking to ensure her advice was relevant to my dog's breed. They even gave me a little picture of my pup after the appointment. I am so happy I found them, and that they are so close to my house! :)</Text>

Dr. Alison Moore is the BEST! I brought my puppy for her check up,  as she is soon to be 1 year old. It was of course a no contact visit, the check in procedure quite simple. Dr. Alison called me after my dog's initial exam and explained everything to me and answered all my questions very thoroughly. I never felt rushed. Dr. Alison seems to really care for the animals she treats and makes you feel like your pet is special. The friendly nurse was great and after explaining my invoice item by item, everything seemed to be reasonably priced.  This is our second visit and will continue to use Pet's Friend and especially Dr. Alison Moore!<//Text>

<review>Was referred to Pet’s Friend Animal clinic through another Dental clinic for my first dog. Very professional and fast and absolutely thorough. Got an appointment for a puppy wellness exam with Dr. Koski for our new puppy and we got there early and they took us in early as well. Had proper protocols in place for the pandemic and was very friendly. Got all the wellness exam record via email quickly the next day and with fast response too. Thank you and see you folks on our next puppy vaccine appointment! Will be switching our dog and cat over to Pet’s Friend Animal Clinic as well.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

My cat did not need it and she reacted very poorly.  In addition, at our visit yesterday after checkout, they forgot to bring me my pet!  I called to let them know I was still waiting in the car and they were surprised I didn't have her with me...  I expressed my concern and was met with a rather unprofessional response. Additionally, at my first visit - a vet tech provide very confusing information about my kitten's gender (she's calico so it's pretty easy to know).  After the vet confirmed she was a female cat, the tech came out and said we don't know what the gender is and we cannot know until she is older.  What?  Unfortunately I got an unprofessional vibe here on a few accounts and will be returning to my previous wonderful Sunnyvale Vet.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Very efficient setup for safe vet visits - we were nervous because it was our first vet visit for our newly adopted dog, but the staff was super friendly and quickly calmed our anxious pet before bringing her into the clinic from our car. Our new vet, Dr. Moore, called us after a swift checkup and not only gave us the full run-down of our dog’s health, but also stayed on the line to address our concerns and many questions (as first time dog owners)! We learned so much and our dog seemed completely herself again by the time she was carried back to our car, which must have been magic since our dog has been so uncomfortable without us so far. Keep doing what you’re doing - you’re providing a great experience even given unstable times and we could all use some of the optimism!< /text>

Cheers to Pet's Friend for a using common sense approach to pet care, this is just what we needed. The vet took extra time to talk and explain things with us and didn't try to upsell us on anything. Ordered an Rx thru Chewy and had no issues.  Would recommend without reservation, they are organized, attentive and responsive. Thank you PFAC!!< /Review>

<Review>Recommended by friend, we visited Pet's Friend twice for our puppy's wellness check and DHPP and Bordetella vaccination. They are very professional, you can also ask them general question about the puppy by a simple call, that is lifesaver to us.< /Review>< Pics>

<rating>5</rating><text>My girlfriend & I took our rescue puppy to her first vet check. It was our first time having to take her to the vet so we didn’t really know what to expect ourselves. They were so professional & her visit was pretty good! Her vet called us & was so nice ! We had a list of questions which she answered & reassured us that we were doing well for our very first rescue pup! We were relieved that that made our first vet visit a great one. We were waiting to see if after our first visit , we would take our pup elsewhere. But after this we are most definitely going to keep this as her clinic!</text>< Pics>

The 2 veterinarians who examined my dog in my last couple visits were very professional and spent time with me on the phone explaining treatments and answering all my questions. I never felt like I was rushed off the phone. Most of the support staff has been very friendly, caring, and professional as well. And as an added bonus, the location is VERY close to where I'm living now. I recommend them.</review>< pics>

I have make an appointment through the phone number on the window of this clinic. But this appointment is not showing in the database. And maybe for appointment, we may need to double check whether the appointment is made successfully or not. Super bad experience< /Text>

We just started taking our pup here and have been so impressed by how helpful and thorough the entire team has been. Unlike some other vets they haven’t made us feel pressured to buy any products or treatments and they have been so informative regarding any questions and concerns we’ve had. We are so grateful to have found such a great fit.</review>

Due to Covid-19, a nurse takes the dog in alone, and we had to wait in the car. Even with that, the staff was kind, professional and super patient (while extremely knowledgeable!), as they guided us and explained everything that was happening. We came back two hours later due to a mild concern, and team ran another checkup on our puppy with love and care (and no additional charges).

<review>Let me first say that I'm one of those crazy cat lady people, so i'm very, very picky about who I let take care of my babies. Very picky. That being said, I love everything about Pet's Friend Animal Clinic! Both my Mom and I have taken our cats there for over 6 years and will never take them anywhere else. We happily drive (or more accurately, sit in traffic) from Redwood City to Sunnyvale to go there.  Dr. Alison Moore is not only an incredibly competent veterinarian, she is kind, caring, compassionate, and understanding. She will give you an honest assessment of your cat's health without trying to push unneeded tests or procedures. We've also seen Dr. Koski when Dr. Moore was on vacation and she is just as fantastic. The front desk staff and the vet techs are also wonderful - they treat you and your pet with kindness and respect.  I can't say enough good things about this place.< /review><UserId.>104082182548557262313</UserId.>< Pictures>

<Review>I love this veterinary clinic. All the staff, from office staff to technicians to the vets, are extremely caring and compassionate people. The vets have doggedly (!) pursued answers to unusual health issues our dogs have had and always answer our questions clearly. We recently had to put our one of our dogs down, and the staff was incredibly sensitive to our needs. The vet even cried with us at the end!< /Review>< pictures>

<Text>The Vets are really cool and knowledgeable, but I feel like they have to make a quota on sales. They update you and suggest you do this test and this test, then do more labs etc. Of course we love our dogs so we do what they say but at the end of the day it just comes down to dollars to them.  I am disappointed because we came in for a simple cough and left with an $1200 bill. Ouch. On a teachers salary that is difficult.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

I can't say enough about this vet.  They wonderful with my pet. The building is old and needs some remodeling but I'll take great service and care for my dog over a fancy building.  They also take in abandoned animals. They simply live animals.  They've done a good job with caring for my dog.</Text>

<review>excellent service, except the pricing is rather high. The spay/neuter is sometimes free at shelter, but here it costs over $1000, if I remember correctly, which is not covered by insurance. If you don't care about spending above average cost, this is a place I will recommend.< /review></record>

I love how efficiently this office is run but I mostly love how friendly and genuinely caring every single one of the staff members are. Our doctor is Dr.Alison Moore and she is the absolute best veterinarian we've ever had. A bit ashamed to admit bit I've been to many, many veterinarians and Dr.Moore is by far the best. We recently moved to San Francisco but continue to make the drive down to Sunnyvale to see Dr. Moore.</text>

Brought my brothers cat Lucifer here for a broken toe/nail. Turn out to be infected. He need antibiotics which they were able to offer me 3 types being pill, liquid,  and shot. I asked for the price difference of liquid and pill being about $45 and the shot was about $71 67. I went for the shot (way easier for my cat) and he came home with gauze soaked with chlorhexidine $16.00 and pain medication of buprenorphine $43.40. He also got the rabies shot $29.50 and FVRCP shot for $36.50 good for 3 years. Overall my experience here was more then amazing. They explained everything he had going on what he needed and cost was affordable from other Vets. Physical assessment was $74.50 making the total bill of $271.57. I like to put the prices because I know I can't be the only one who likes to read reviews before heading over with my fur baby and would like to know if its going to cost me an arm or a leg or just a few hundred dollars. Alot of vets are more about the money then the wellbeing of the pet. I hope this helps any one looking to bring their fur baby to this Vet!!!< /text>

<Review>My cat was not doing well. Not eating lethargic etc..
Dr. MILLER attributed it to stage 2 kidney disease and suggested the usual fluids and diet change. Prescribed the usual meds as expected. I called her 5 days later in the morning to see if I can come in to get more fluids in my cat. She didn't call me back until 20 min
Before they were closing and told me to go to emergency vet. That didnt sit well with me.
I went to emergency vet and within 3 min
Of exam he felt a large lump in her intestinal tract.  I agreed to xrays ultra sound and biopsy. Results came back the next day and confirmed there is a tumor  the Size  of a walnut in her intestinal tract.  Even the Dr. Said he doesn't know how the other Vet. ( Miller) could have missed it.
So NO, I highly do NOT RECOMMEND GOING TO THIS PLACE.</Review>< Pictures>

<text>I've been to several other veterinary locations in the area and this is by FAR the best one.  I took my cat in for urgent care and they were very gentle and caring to both me and my furrkid.  I had Dr. Miller and it was clear she knew how to handle cats well.  I had blood work done and got the results the SAME day.  I wasn't up-sold at all (other places like to tack on things like nail trimming) and pricing was very, very reasonable.  The place is very clean, not smelly at all.< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<review>My husband and I took our cat to Pet's Friends Animal Clinic and the vet spent much time trying to become our cat's friend. She ended up scaring our cat who hid under the bench. We had to bring our cat back multiple times to the vet to get treatment. First, we were told the cat carrier needed to be smaller so that the vet could try giving her treatment while the cat was still in the carrier. That didn't work. Next we had to put medicine in our cat's food to sedate her so that she would be calm for the treatment. That didn't work either.

Our cat is not a mean or aggressive cat. She's just like any other normal cat, scared of strange people and needles. We weren't even allowed to be in the room with our cat while she was supposed to get treatment. How are we supposed to comfort our cat so that she will be calm enough to get treatment?

After three traumatic sessions at the vet, the vet came back in the room holding the cat carrier with our cat in it and happily announced with a huge smile that our cat had refused treatment. What a waste. We don't need a friend for our cat. We need a vet for our cat. We won't be taking our cat back here again.< /review>< rating>

A couple years ago, I unfortunately had to put my beloved 16 year old cat to sleep. I walked in, and was immediately sent to a private room, and was taken care of. The doctor was so kind, and let me have all the time that I needed with her after she was gone. At the end, I didn't have to sign any forms, or pay a fee, what was important to them was for me to go home and grieve. A couple days later, I received a card with my cats paw print and hand written notes of the doctors and nurses that work there.
Fast forward to 2017, I take my 7 year old cat, who is very shy and is not a fan of new people,  in to get a check up. He was hiding under the chair, and instead of picking him up and putting him on the table, she sat down next to him, and did the examination on the floor. She made sure he was comfortable and eventually had him purring.
As one of those "crazy cat lady" who fusses over the well being of my animals, I never worry that he won't be comfortable.  I know he is in good hands when he arrives.
Highly recommended!<//Text>

Beautiful loving people to care for your pets. I came in with very little money and they understood that I was using my food money to care for my pet. They listened and chose the best options to get the best care for my cat for my money. Their care is impeccable.</Review>

<review>I moved to the Bay Area with my cat, Buddy, in the Summer of 2015. After going to the same veterinarian for nearly my entire life, I was very anxious about finding a new vet which I could trust to take care of my cat. The vet staff at Pet's Friend Animal Clinic are wonderful! I have now taken Buddy here twice, both times to see Dr. Allison Moore. You can tell that she, and the rest of the staff, truly care about you and your animal. I'm very relieved to have found this exceptional clinic, and I plan to continue taking my cat here for the foreseeable future!<//review>< Response>

We are so glad that you and Buddy found us after your move and that you are happy with the care we have provided to both of you! We look forward to being Buddy's care team for many years to come!"}<//Response>

<text>We just got a new pup and found Pet's Friend when he had a little medical emergency. They fit him in between appointments and took great care of him. We look forward to years of care with the team that really is a friend to pets. And, they communicate well with humans too.< /text><Resp>None</Resp><Date>1536701262141< /Date>< Pics>

Best Vet in California. When your vet cries with you, you know they're good. Dr. Miller and crew are loving, compassionate people. They've been ours for almost 10 years. I highly recommend them.</Text>

<text>Their services are just fine and everything.  However we ended up switch vets because my dog was coughing and the ladies at the desk all but accused me out right of abusing my baby.  A few days later I had to take her to the emergency vet at a different clinic due to her coughing fits.  The people at the other clinic quickly identified the problem and helped her.  They even called up a few days later to make sure she was okay.  So when I decided to change vets I called up to get my dog's medical records released to the other place.  The lady was extremely rude about it.  She said she'd send the records to me and I could release them myself and followed it with a snyde sounding "okay bye" and hung up on me.< /text>< user>

<text>This place offered me excellent customer service and helped me return a dog to it's owners and make friends at the same time! They have a chip scanner, and were referred to me by The Pet Hotel (The one right on Wolfe and Central) after I brought in my neighbors Shin Tzu Cavalier 🐕 who was walking around the neighborhood. Luckily he had a chip, and they were able to put me in touch with the owner within 15 min.  Also, the lady at the front gave me a leash to keep him on while I waited for them to get in contact. Very nice staff at the front I appreciated their love and sincerity for animals -- which I value in any animal care facility.<//text></record>

< Review>
To be clear, in years past, we had a decent experience with this vet but we recently bought our cat in to get her ears cleaned as she has an allergy that causes bacteria in her ear. It seems they got too deep into her ears and messed with her equilibrium. She was dizzy the moment we brought her home and vommitted serval times. I was immediately alarmed and brought her in again the next day. We were charged much more than expected and left with no conclusion. We were charged for steroids and other things that we didn't ever agree to. I called to voice my unhappiness about the charges and the treatment of my cat and the manager was quite rude. Not good customer service. Our cat has now been dizzy for weeks (we were told she would "get her sea legs" and it would go away and it has not). We called a week ago to make an appointment or get advice and still have not received a call back. Not a good experience. We are bummed and our cat is far worse off than when we brought her in.</Review>

We have been taking our doggie girls to Pet's Friends since they opened. Although there have been many changes over the years, the loving care they have given our dogs, myself, and wife has always been consistent. That's because you can tell they love animals and want to help them live a long, happy, and healthy life. The Doctors are special - they take time to explain medical process, explain options to us, and really listen to our concerns. The Pet's Friends' staff treats us like family. The staff provides more than just administrative and technical support to the Doctors - they provide a professional atmosphere of confidence while making everyone feel at home. I would not hesitate recommending them to my friends.<//review>

My dog was seek and this place has been amazing!

Everybody is amazingly friendly and helpful. They suggested that we could come back if the dog doesn't get any better and they would have a look for free, or that we can send a picture by email if we have any doubt or question!<//review>

These folks have been taking care of my cats for over a decade.  They have a couple of vets and vet techs who are all excellent.  My cats don't seem stressed, it is all timely and they have a great network of specialists.< /Review>

I have three cats, and one of them is older and needs more attention.

I LOVE how Dr. Davidson takes care of me and my little Graziella. The whole team at Pet's Friend is genuinely caring and loving.

They will take the extra step for your wellbeing and the wellbeing of your animal. I strongly recommend this clinic!</Review>< gmapID>

<Resp>None</Resp><Review>This morning made the hard decision to have my "sisters'  18 year old kitty, Baby put to sleep. I will tell you why I decided. Even though Baby was mostly comfortable as she retreated to the backyard, putting her face into whatever corner. she was very weak in her limbs, slipping, esp she jumped off the bed, and once landed very badly. And she could no longer poop and she was in pain when she tried. So it was not the pain of death per se, but the high chance of painful injury on top of this.
I searched for possible nearby vets and liked that the vets here were all women...and great reviews.

I called at 7:30 and made appt for 11:30... and got cost. estimateabout !$150 for Euthanasia and cremation combined, about what I was give for the shelter services.

I was treated with much compassion the moment  I arrived, escorted into a private room instantly....and the aide started taking vitals like temp and weight...filling out forms. Why she doing that? It is not like this kitty is coming back for another appt.

I met with the vet and told her the cat's history and why I decided to bring her in...though she would probably die on her own within hours anyway. I did not want her to have accident or end her final  hours in pooptrauma... and painful yowling.

I decided not to be with Baby during the shots,  sure Baby  would not be traumatized .. However went to pay the bill and it was over $200. .. what happened to the $150 I was quoted! The fee was for the health exam. I asked for the cat to not be cremated then... They adjusted the bill and I paid it...and but the aide came out then and said they would handle the cremation gratis...so they get five stars instead of three.

So sad day, but bhe best choice, unfortunately. I would go back to them if i had a pet again...which I won't ...<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Up until my cats last visit recently I put my trust in this place but recently was told according to a feline age etc there is a national kidney function guideline I go was told after lab work done at visit my 11 year old cat who is love of my life had basically beginning of kidney failure was told to purchase prescription kidney support food which I did until I went to get a second opinion and when I did the reknowned facility I took her too said that she has normal function just needed to lose a little weight so now she's on prescription metabolic also told at this place and not the second opinion I got that she has retinal damage the second opinion said normal age related changes only and this place said my cats thyroid is problematic and second opinion said no problems with the thyroid so 500.00 later from this place and another couple hundred from second opinion which second opinion was money well spent and I wasted the other 500.00 on a misdiagnosis from a place I used to put my trust in at one point so I won't be back here for obviously valid reasons also note the misdiagnosis was the day before a three day weekend of me dwelling in her having a shorter life span and a serious diagnosis not nice at all to go through</text>

Food was hot and delicious. Staff was friendly and they got people's orders out at a good pace. They fututeproof by making lots of hot n ready items when they know they will get a lot of customers. Always come to this spot.< /Text>

<Text>I ordered online around 5:30pm and went an hour later when my app said it should be ready. I went to pizza portal and found out they aren't even using it. I then waited in line forever and was told it was coming out and being boxed. So, I waited a while longer and checked again...and again was told it's coming out of the oven and being boxed by a different employee. It took another customer in line to say something about it and all of a sudden my pizza was ready. Many people who ordered online were waiting an hour or more for their pizza orders. That was horrible! I know it's Valentine's, but that's why I ordered online ahead of time knowing it would be busy.</Text>< gmap_id>

WHEN MY ORDER WAS MESSED UP....I WAS PROVIDED THE "FRANCHISE OWNERS" PERSONAL PHONE NUMBER & EMAIL ADDRESS. THE OWNER TOOK CARE OF MY PROBLEM IMMEDIATELY (COMPED MY ORDER) & INSISTED ON COMPING ME AN ADDITIONAL LARGE PIZZA. THAT'S WHAT I CALL TAKING CARE OF YOUR CUSTOMERS. (P. S. - I COULD HAVE BEEN A 1st TIME CUSTOMER OR A LONG TIME LOYAL CUSTOMER - HE DID NOT KNOW & TREATED ME WITH MUCH RESPECT)</Review>

Love this place.. The only reason its not a 5 star is because they can't seem to make up their minds on if we can replace marinara sauce with ranch or not... Bugs that sometime they let me and sometimes they don't...same place different people...🌟🌟🌟🌟👎<//text>

<text>I waiting 30 minutes for a “hot and ready” while I could hear the team members holding inappropriate conversations which was the most frustrating part! Instead of the associate  apologizing or advising me that my food would be out shortly or something she just blankly looked at me knowing she had given others after me their food first while I had been waiting . The cashier (girl w/ colored eyes) was hollering  at the back team while taking orders. The assistant manager was on duty and he did not say anything about what was going on instead partook in the conversations. I am a manager myself and I would have wanted my assistant to correct the behaviors on the spot instead of making an embarrassment of my store. I know I am not the only one who was irritated in the store multiple customers were communicating to each other on their behaviors. VERY UNPROFESSIONAL environment!< /text></record>

Seems like a well-run Little Caesars.  We’ve had a couple visits and they were efficient, with good pizza.  Wish they had a few more if the Bestest pizzas ready each time, but otherwise everything was fine.< /review>

<review>Pizza is pretty good. You can't beat the price. We usually opt for the extra most bestest. It is better than a regular "hot and ready." The customer service is poor and they never have any pizzas ready not even the "hot and ready's." I usually will call ahead and order and I will add and extra 10-15 to whatever wait time they give me.< /review><pics>None</pics><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

Before the service wasn't anything to brag about, Now their employees are hella nice and everytime I stop here or call in they are very polite, professional and smile. And of course you have to get the $8 deep dish, it's sooooo good.  Thanks for making us feel like we are important to you.  You guys ROCK.<//text>

Service and food were really good. They have a great selection for table entree’s with lots of variety. HUGE selection of rolls. Can’t wait to go back and try some. My wife and I split the salmon and steak, shrimp and lobster. I love the fact that it’s a small restaurant with I think 7 or 8 tables plus a bar.< /review>

The absolute best of the best ❤️

They are wonderful, food is superb.  We normally get sushi rolls and sometimes we take our out of town children with us and they will get the grill.

We love it here!!< /Review>

Food was decent. Service was lacking, we felt rushed to war and run. The cook was pleasant.<//Review>

Tonight my husband and I ordered dinner to celebrate our 19th Anniversary ( couldn't go anywhere with the smoky air). He had the Chicken and Shrimp entree and I had the Teriyaki Chicken entree. This was our first time ordering food or even eating here and we thoroughly enjoyed our food. There was a large quantity of food and all of it was delicious. We will be back. Thank you for all that you are doing during this uncertainty and hope you will be back open for dine in soon.</text>

We came here for a birthday dinner party. Our group was out to have fun and fun was what we got! Our chef was delightful and humorous..the service was very attentive and fast. The dinner was very good, I thoroughly enjoyed my steak and calamari. Others in our party enjoyed their meals too.< /text>

<rating>5</rating><Text>What a great experience! Went with my family and in law's for a birthday dinner. First impressions as I went in was how clean the restaurant is. Even the overhead cooking hoods were spotless, not a drop of grease present anywhere.  The whole place was spotless.  The menu is simple and straightforward with plenty of variety.  We ordered some apps while we waited for the show.

Mack came to the grill and started his show with fire. He did a great job with a lot of skill and humor. His cooking was well executed and the food tasted great. Even my very picky son liked the chicken teriyaki, a dish he had to date refused to try.  I will be asking for him the next time I am there.
The prices are very reasonable, the service excellent. If you are looking for a fun experience in Elk Grove stop by.</Text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None</response><gmapID>0x809ac8effd3bdffb:0xd6e4b39b8e93ed8f</gmapID></record>

Definitely fun Tepan for the whole family. Chef Frank made our evening. He kept us laughing and mesmerized by his culinary talents. I highly recommend the garlic fried rice w/bacon. All the dishes were delicious and filling. Be prepared to take home leftovers. I ordered a combo Steak & Calamari. They'll give you some dipping sauces which are good, but not needed as the seasoning and grilling are flavorful enough.</Review>

I arranged for a small surprise party dinner for my husband and we all enjoyed our meals. Our chef was highly entertaining and the service was good. I did feel they could serve a bit more of the proteins, as we had mounds of rice and vegetables, but a bit skimpy on the meat courses. I think adding a small shrimp first course to all meals (something I've always been served at similar restaurants) might solve the protein problem I mentioned. The majority of our diners had grilled food but those that had sushi and sashimi seemed pleased with theirs. I was told that a table seats ten, but our nine were actually too many for the table. My only other suggestion would be that they clean the tables better; we were the first diners at our table and it was very sticky. Will definitely try Wasabi again.< /review>

First time going here. Place was really good, our cook Joe was really friendly and gave really good advice for when we come back. I know I will request him to cook for us again. The food was really good and the price was comparable to the food they have. Advice for first timers order desert. (puff pastry deep fried)<//text>

I try to visit Wasabi Twice a Month.They have the Very Best Deep Fried Sushi Rolls. Nice in size, Made with More Filling as opposed to having a Small portion of Filling surrounded by Very Thick Breadding. Also, The Teriyaki Sauce is Definitely on my All - TimeTop 3 List!! Last but not Least, The Garlic/ Bacon/ Garlic Fried Rice is to Die For.< /Review>

Always enjoy this Sushi spot. It's a regular for me. The restaurant team is friendly and efficient. The sushi is really tasteful and always comes through fresh. The teppanyaki is good but the sushi is where this place really shines. A small sushi bar with the rest of the seating at the cooking stations so you can find yourself waiting for some time to be seated. Arrive before the main surge for dinner and you should be Ok. The sushi is excellent so worth the gamble!</text>

<Review>On Saturday, I went for dinner at Wasbi with my hubby and two kids. I thought it was a sushi restaurant but to my surprise, they had Hibachi table. The grills are set up to fit at least 8-10 people at the table. it's a fun place to come in groups to celebrate birthdays or get together.

I ordered the Lobster and shrimp and my husband got the beef, chicken and scallops. We paid extra for the garlic fried rice which was awesome.

It was hot inside the restaurant. Our server was attentive and the chef was awesome. My kids eyes lite up when the chef made the volcano with the onions. It was an awesome experience.</Review><response>None</response><name>Ashi Vinod</name><Rate>3< /Rate>< Pics>

<Review>We came here to celebrate a birthday, and they definately gave us memorable night! The food was delicious, and the staff was super friendly, prices were good, but we will definately be going back for our waiter Aaron! He was awesome! This is our new favorite japanese restaurant. Thanks again for the great experience Aaron!!</Review>< pictures>

<review>Spend $94 for family of 4 (6 & 9 years old), and my stomach and wife was half full.
how do you expect average family to comeback once every 2 weeks? or weekly. I think portion all too small . Probably cheaper to order 2 kid's portion than regular.
4 -star mainly for the hibachi style cooking, but  cost too much.<//review></record></dataset><record>

<rate>5</rate><Text>A fun place to have dinner. The meats/seafood (depending on what you chose) is prepared right in front of you with a show-like experience. I recommend the garlic fried rice option because it is very tasty. They give you sauces to dip your meats/seafood in. The food here goes well with Sapporo or Asahi. Highly recommended.<//Text><gmap_id>0x809ac8effd3bdffb:0xd6e4b39b8e93ed8f<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>I am only giving it a 1 cause the fried rice my husband had was good. Way to expensive and you have to wait around for the chef to finish at other tables. Too loud and drinks are Horrible. Don't plan on going back. Very disappointed.</review>< user>

Not too bad...the veggies were firm, the steak and shrimp were fresh, and the chef was pretty entertaining. Would give additional 1/2 star if possible.</text>

Horrible! We were regular customers!  A month ago we ordered a large take out order, after we took it home there was a human nail in one of our plates!  I immediately drove back there and showed the owner, then she offered a refund on that one plate!  Should havr learned then but we didn't amd gave them another chance and went in today for my daughtere's 10th birthday,  and our waiter was nice until he brought in the wrong appetizer.  I then asked him to bring us the correct one,  his response to us was absurd, he couldn't since my kids ate 1 of the shrimps! Our order is always well over 150$, there are 6 of us.. Being frustrated with his response and hostile demeanor I asked to speak to the manager.  The manager was decent and understanding trying to make things better, but the waiter refused to calm down, arguing and yelling!  When I asked the manager for my bill because we were leaving our waiter's reaponse was bye! Took my family and paid for whatever they brought out,  gave them a big tip and left!  They're customer service is great as long as nothing goes wrong!  It's miles below par!  Rude and don't care for their customers!!  We will never go there again, nor recommend this to anyone. Many better sushi places in town!</text>

THIS WAS SO DELICIOUS!!!! My boyfriend and I stopped here to pick up a slice because they have vegan and regular pizza. They also have a great 2 slices one beer deal. 100/10 will be coming here again. Their crust is so crispy! 😍<//Text>

<Text>We had a great experience with Mr Moro Pizza Ocean Beach and will definitely be back. We came to this location specifically to get the vegan cheese/pepperoni for me. It was so good, the cheese was so creamy and the pepperoni had such a good flavor! Not all locations have vegan cheese so make sure you check the menu before hand.

There’s so many interesting flavor combos (or you can make your own like me) I added garlic, pineapple, and green pepper!

Pro tip: if you like them on Instagram you can get a free knot!

We’ll definitely be visiting for more yummy pizza, soon!< /Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNS2gJxEOUpPXXS5HeegkVDauRU9jGbixTYwufh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO_6ASCWgQpd_k1bZhllJf7loMHZOu8TCUMrt2h=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< Resp>

<Text>Once again this location fails. Every time I go here there is a problem with my order- it’s wrong, takes too long, gaslighting from the staff, or just basic mismanagement of their check out process. The pizza is ok at best. I go there for the pizza but now I will never be going back because of the poor poor quality of customer service and complete lack of basic take out skills. I can’t stress enough how consistently bad their service is. DO NOT ORDER FROM THE OB LOCATION.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

I was very wowed by the service here and also how efficiently they work while maintaining the freshness of the product. I really enjoyed trying their different pizza-by-the-slice options as well as their amazing garlic knots. The stuffed knots were simply to die for and I can’t recommend them enough. That warm and gooey ricotta filling is where it’s at!! I look forward to coming back and this time bringing more bellies because this is a place to sit, eat delightfully and fill all the way up!!</Text>< gmapID>

< Review>
A restroom stop after watching the sunset turned into one of the best pizza’s I have ever tasted and I’m Italian! Great pricing for some super delicious food.. before we realized and did some research Mr Moto himself was at the restaurant working behind the counter. Very nice guy. Super cute place. You have our vote all the way from Florida.

Great pizza and garlic knots, and good salads, too. We stopped here briefly and had a bite, and we both enjoyed a slice. Great place for a quick lunch,  highly recommended in Ocean Beach.< /Review>

<Rating>2<//Rating><review>I have ordered from them three times. 1st time the order was completely wrong. I am willing to give in for small things, but not everyone wants jalapeno on their pizza. When I called to report it they wanted a picture. I text it immediately. The second time they got it right but it was super late. Tonight....I am still waiting. They said delivery in 55 minutes. It has been one hour and 20 minutes. When I called, they blamed it on a new driver. Who knows when it will get here...decent pizza but not worth the drama.< /review>< Pics>

<rating>2< /rating><Review>The food took way long to get, even though I had called in advance. Poor quality, and too expensive for what you get...$22 for sub-par meatball Sandi's. I waited 15-20 minutes and they were still lukewarm when I ate them 5 minutes later.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

<Review>Experience started off great, nice chill environment. Ordered a build your own pizza. The order became ready and luckily we checked before leaving. In the order we never said anything about what kind of cheese or cheese at all. We let the cashier Gibran F. know of the situation, she then decided to say it’s vegan cheese and that it was ok. Another associate as well said it was vegan cheese. The owner himself Mr. Moto came out to look at it himself and distinguished that it in fact was regular cheese. Gibran then said typically when you order a pizza it said that it automatically comes with cheese, as if it was our fault in not saying no cheese when it was a BUILD YOUR OWN pizza. So for one we were blamed at fault for quote on quote not saying to add something when we never asked for it in the first place and then 2 being lied to about it as if it was going to be ok. We’re both vegans, vegan cheese or not if I didn’t ask for it then I didn’t want it. I will say I was displeased with this experience and probably will never go back again.</Review>< pics>

First off, no one named Christian here. Been sitting here for almost a hour. Only two workers so hard to say how long I will be here. I DO NOT recommend this place. Been here a hour and no one has even said anything to me. Horrible experience. Never again</Review>

Highly recommend them. Cris not only helped me in a timely manner, he clearly explained my options  by giving me all related information so I could make a educated decision on the best coverage best me. He also made sure DMV was promptly notified I had insurance, to ensure my driver license  was not suspended.< /Text>

it turns out that they do not write one month policies ....screwed myself pretty good here ...Its best to just be honest to your potential customers as opposed to just saying anything to get them in your office.<//Review><Response>None</Response>< UserId.>

I think few of this 5 stars are fake , they charge too much for their services,  i paid over 55 just for a sticker for my car , they wanted 55 for their service plus the 22 for the replacement of the sticker , ill probably change insurance too</Text>

I've been starting to have Mimi regularly do my nails since I moved from the bay area. I had been seeing my previous nail tech, for about 6 years, and it's been hard to find another tech half as good. I think Mimi might be an aspiring nail artist as I noticed she photographs all her work. When she does my nails, I think she senses that I am particular, so she takes good care of me, and is trying hard to learn my style :)  She remembers the little things-that I like my cuticles and fingertips trimmed of dead skin, because I have a lot. (nail biter) or other small details that make a big difference. I'm excited to keep seeing how she 'wows' me, because I wanna keep her!!<//Review>

Not my first choice but it's not bad either if needed I would go back but only if I cant get into my normal place.

Omg. This business is so clean and workers are so nice.  They do a really good job on my pedicure.  I drive from Stockton to Galt where they are located because Im happy with their business. I pass so many pedicure places to arrive to VIP nails.  I will reschedule my next appointment and tell all my family and friends.
Thank you to them.< /text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Text>Worst pedicure I have ever had! Barely any massage.  The guy grab my ankle so hard and even after I said it hurt he still didn't let up. I had to move my foot. Then when he was doing my fill, he argued with me about the way the looked. Don't go here. They were so over booked we had to wait for 20 mins for our appointment.  There were some people waiting over an hour for their appointment.< /Text>< Pictures>

I get my pedicures from Quinn.  She does a very good job for me.  She understands and speaks English well and is always good to be very careful with one sensitive toe.   All the ladies seem very nice.  The plexiglass set-up between the massage chair and employee seems very safe for preventing COVID-19.< /review>

After I left I realized that the nails on one hand were longer than the other. It was decently clean. Save your money go else where.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

Really reasonable prices for a manicure and pedicure. You also get a shoulder and neck massage with your manicure. They also do a great job on eyebrow waxing -- with plucking and trimming. They pay attention to the details here. The staff is also very nice. Recommend<//text>

I my first time at OP and I'm really happy with the results I felt very pampered and my nails turned out very perfect and that's how exactly how I wanted it to be you! You can see how much time and effort they put into your nails because the outcome of your nails is amazing! & I would highly recommend this anyone<//review>

I have been to so many salons over the years and I'm in love with this place. First time went there was last week and I love the way my nails were done and the product used is fantastic. I have a phobia of drills so get a bit nervous when I get my nails done. Jenny was amazing and didn't feel like she was going to burn or cut me at all. I will be going here from now on.<//review>

<review>Not the best place, I went there because of the good reviews and I had a BAD experience. my nails had to be redone 3 times because she couldn't just make them square. I've been to many places and this was not in the top 3! And now I just took my GEL Polish off and it messed up my nail so obviously they use the best gel Polish because I have never had that happen to me, never going back!!< /review></record></dataset><record>

I have gone to this salon for over a year now. The old owner (david) and his wife opened a new shop in rocklin and his brother kenny took over. They are super nice and have a lot of pedicure options. No one yells or anything at anytime that i have ben there. They dont whisper but i dont mind. Plus im not paying 85 dollars for a manicure either.<//Text>

North coast church Carlsbad is an awesome campus. They have lots of friendly staff and people. They have free coffee and desserts on Sunday mornings and Saturday nights. The staff is very welcoming, there are lots of opportunities to serve, weather in the parking industry, kids in daycare, sound system, setting up the parking lot, helping with coffee,  working in the café , And much more. The sermons are awesome and you can always find help when needed.<//text>

North Coast is blessed with so many great churches but this is by far my favorite. They preach good strong Doctrine and have a real world and common sense approach to the Bible. They're very welcoming, non-judgemental, and just a great healthy place to go to church!<//Text>

Here you'll find great people, excellent worship and there's always morning coffee with an assortment of breakfast items. There is a family room if you have a baby and places to sit in the lobby where you can watch the service as well.< /Text>

I luv this church, the message is easy 2 understand, every1 is quite friendly 2 make u feel welcome, helpful & always willing 2 help, if nd be. An added plus, the pastors can be comical at x's, while preaching the word, no matter what age you are.<//text>

It's my third sunday lastweek and I'm so blessed by his teachings everytime I listen to him. I like the way he delivered the message, from bible to you with no filter what so ever.  He speaks the truth about bible.

Small and quiet spot for Southeast Asian food. Menu selection is not that wide but the food has authentic flavors and dishes you can not find in most other places. The people working here are efficient. The interior space, decor, cutlery and overall vibe sadly still have a lot of room for improvement.< /Text>

<review>Good place for lunch or snack. I have had the Char Kuay Teow and the Coconut Laksa. Both are very good. I know I should try other things on the menu too, but these are just so good that I don't want to try anything else! lol

also their kopi is pretty decent

they take to-go orders over the phone, so you can call it in and pick up. Nice people working there too.< /review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMpZtYa1gzNkhcGBAHbGE-aMqbuXBxIANEDuWBu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< Resp>

<text>The food is so delicious here. I had the #8 Indonesian Fried Noodle (Mee goreng) and fried tofu. The place is small but there was plenty of seating. If you walk by the place, you will miss it unless you are looking for it. The owners are from Indonesia and Singapore and so the cuisine consists of dishes from the region. They are very friendly. I highly recommend this place!</text>< pics>

SINGAPORE 🇸🇬
Excerpt from Eat the World Los Angeles:
If you have ever traveled in Singapore and some of the larger cities of Malaysia and Indonesia, the letter Q used twice in names will be very familiar. Small street vendors, hawker stalls, and full restaurants all use it similarly, most of which have nothing to do with each other. The term originated in Taiwan and has spread throughout the Chinese-speaking world with many meanings and usages.

In terms of food, the literal translation is akin to "chewy," the Taiwanese version of which sounds like the way people say the letter Q in English. Chewy does not tell the whole story of QQ though, as it implies that the item in question has a good resistance and mouthfeel. Not too soft, a good bounce, nice and chewy.

A good introduction and a wonderful barometer of how satisfying the QQ here will be is a handsome plate of Singapore char kway teow ($9.95). Also full of the other textures from meats, vegetables, and egg, the broad flat noodles have some of the best QQ in town and are the perfect vehicle for a well-balanced blend of seasoning and good spice level. Each bite of the char kway teow reveals a deep level of skill by the chef and just the right amount of each ingredient. When the meats (beef, Taiwanese sausage, shrimp) and vegetables are slightly charred, they give the surrounding elements even more flavor, a technique Cantonese chefs describe as "wok hei" or "wok's breath" in English. This simple phrase might be the best way to describe the simple satisfaction that comes from eating the dish.</review>

<text>We dropped by for lunch. Is right across the street from Pasadena City College. 1 hour Street parking only. They cater to the students and workers around the area.  We couldn't stay long because Pasadena parking enforcement is very active here so 1 hour means you can't really be having much of a conversation with any gatherings. We tried the laksa and char away teow. Both were flavorful and is close enough to what you get in Singapore. No fried pieces of pork fat here. Laksa taste from the $4 packs from the Asian supermarket is stronger than what's served here for $9.95. char away teow is not using the dark sweet thick soy sauce used in Singapore. No cockles (blood clams, "ham"). Kopi at $2.95 is not thick nor strong enough like what you get in Singapore. Kopi-C tasted a little too much like instant.  Evaporated milk taste was present. Still a good place to get something similar to what you get in Singapore. Much better than the fake panasia place.</text><name>w chia<//name>< gmapID>

<Review>First and foremost this place has a great staff. They also have great food, drinks (Thai iced-tea is the best!), along with a great selection of music that makes for a great atmosphere. I recommend coming to this place with your friends and family so that you can all try this place out .< /Review>< pics>

Tiny, friendly Singapore-style coffee shop across the street from Pasadena CC. It took a moment to convince the disbelieving owners that we were legit in our request for everything extra-spicy, but they eventually made with a delicious chili sauce that brought it all home. High marks for the Indonesian-style fried rice, which was spiced up with fresh green chilies, and the popcorn chicken. Any place rocking the Milo Dinosaur is 100% ok with us.</text>

If you are Singaporean or Malaysian and longing for food from home, then this is the place to find it. Selection is very limited but the Laksa and Char Kway Teow is second to none in the greater Los Angeles area.< /text>

Then we get better and tried again and right away after the meal, my family was fighting with a terrible cough and my son had a stomach ache. Not to mentioned they gave us the wrong order, pricy and very small portion but I question their hygiene< /Review><user_name>Freedom Song</user_name>< gmapID>

So happy to find some good food around PCC. Hainanese chicken over rice was what I was looking for and they do a great job at it. The place is small and busy. The boba drinks are good. But the food is awesome.</review>

< Review>
Small fast food outpost serving inexpensive Asian dishes. Most items on the menu are good, not great. Laksa is the curry style rather than the assam style. The test of any Hainanese chicken rice dish is the rice and the one here is not fragrant at all. Still, if you're looking for Indonesian, Singaporean or Malaysian food in a pinch, this place would serve you well.</Review>

Nothing better than sitting in the patio with a drink and some tasty Mexican food. The service is great as well. We ordered to go but it ended up being wrong.

They have a full bar, EXTENSIVE tequila selection and a solid section of domestic as well as local and craft beers on tap.

Nice salsa selection as well, 2 reds and a tasty green are Mainstays.

Come relax and have fun.< /Text>< UserId.>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>I just ate here a couple hours ago with a buddy of mine after our hike. I had to say we worked up an appetite and we're looking for something delicious that would get us full for a good price. Mezcal Grill was definitely the place for that offering a super burrito that made me stuffed but at a reasonable price. The cashier was very friendly and even cracked some good jokes with my friend which made all us laugh. I recommend this place if you haven't tried it before or wish to get some quality food without breaking your wallet. I will be visiting this restaurant again ready for some more delicious food.<//review>< Pics>

Service SO RUDE so bad just not worth it- love Mex food but after the 5th wrong dinner order in a row 👎(not exag unfortunately) mezcal refused to fix, replace, refund or in any way make right...employees very rude to Polite roommate w accusations of lying about order for money when we only requested a remake/ correction dinner to eat after the 3rd time...Very unfortunate and not necessary when we are good customers & as former restaurant workers we tip absurdly high -and just want the food we paid for- but RUDENESS is the normal at this restaurant👎👎👎</Text>

It was great overall. The waitress was very kind, the restaurant was clean and the atmosphere was fun because of the music. I got the shrimp enchiladas with mole sauce, mole is a sweet sauce so I would only reccomend if your into sweet and savory flavors.<//review>

<text>Even though this restaurant was only taking to go orders due to the virus it was a good experience. Super friendly staff delicious food clean environment.  They did take extra steps to keep environment clean such as spray and clean menus spray down counters and spray down the credit card machine where you use your finger to sign for the bill.  Did i mention how good the food was?  Lol</text>< Pics>

< Review>
Food is always great. One of the better Mexican restaurants in  Natomas.  I ordered special burrito. They made it really small so, I asked the server about it.  She later came over and made a price reduction on the receipt.

They were really concerned about us having a good experience.  I was happy they were able to accommodate us. We like this place a lot. Highly recommended if you're in the area.</Review>

Food was great, excellent taste on the food. However, the employee taking the order and the other employee with green hair need to smile more and stop staring customers down. That was uncomfortable. Maybe focus more making customers feel more welcome.</review>

What a great little place! They have the lightest, freshest Mexican food I've ever tasted! We are from Missouri so maybe it's just the Cali thing, but we were impressed. We left full and totally satisfied. I ordered the Mixed Seafood Ceviche Tostada (SO good!) and Mahi Mahi Taco (a la carte), my husband got the Enchiladas de Mole Plate, and his brother got the Mezcal 'Wet' Chicken Burrito. Everything was delicious! They also have a chip bar where you can help yourself to chips and 4 different salsas. Plus - friendly staff, good prices, and clean. Wish we had time to go back again!<//text>

<review>Honestly I don't really ever leave bad reviews, but I have to share my experience with this place.  The servers are nice but the wait time was less than exceptional. Waited about 5+ minutes to be seated when there were a few open tables.  Ordered a beer and food and 30 minutes later still didn't have our food.  Other people waiting also looked a little frustrated.  Seemed as though the kitchen was backed up but it's a small place. Nice ambiance, poor execution. We won't go here again.< /review><time>1583640590919<//time>< Name>

<Text>I was very surprised that this place was so nice. There aren't very many places in Natomas to get good Mexican food, but this place was great. Their shrimp tacos were really good, as well as their burritos, and their bean dip. Service was excellent as well, and the owner of the restaurant is very involved in ensuring quality.</Text>< gmap_id>

This is my go to place for fresh Mex. I am working my way through the menu. So far I super delighted. Fresh Mex made to order. Will prepare special plates for those with food allergies too. Excellent friendly service. Eddie you are the BEST! Excellent service and always with a smile!   😊  I love the salsa & chips bar.  DELISH!< /text>

<text>Great food, great drinks. A little pricey but you definitely get what you pay for. Everything ordered was top notch. Great taquila selection and nice craft beer choices for their limited tap.</text>< gmap_id>

<Text>If I had been told I was gonna get charged with $5.94 extra. I wouldn't buy anything.. They are ok tacos but not $3.48 a piece.
I would rather drive all the way to citrus heights and stop at dos riós restaurant and get better tacos... Apart on several occasions when I asked for an al pastor burrito instead of meat they have put scrapes.
So I'm done with this place..</Text>< Time>

From out of town and we just wanted a good place to go with the family. Google did not let me down, and we had great food at a great price. Easy to see the signage from the road, and a lot of parking is available. Tables are available outside. You order and pay, and they give you a number for your table where they bring your order. The person that took our order made great recommendations, and the margaritas was so good and refreshing. We had the enchilada plate, fajita plate, quesadilla plate and California burger burrito, and all of it got 2 thumbs up all around.<//Review>

<review>If you want truly authentic Mexican cuisine that's perfectly prepared and beautifully presented, this is the restaurant for you. My husband had the cheese enchiladas and chilli rellenos; both came with the most amazing sauces. He could not stop raving about how delicious his dinner was. After sampling his meal, I totally agreed with him. I had the grilled shrimp salad. The shrimp was sumptuous and wonderfully seasoned. It was a light, yet satisfying meal, which is exactly what I wanted. Our waiter was wonderful - attentive and conscientious. This is now our favorite Mexican restaurant!<//review>< pics>

My wife loves this place far more than I do - she'd undoubtedly give them 5 stars.  I like the food well enough.  I only order for takeout because of two major issues:

1) The chairs are very skinny and so very uncomfortable for a heavyset man like me

2) The one time I went the service was unbelievably slow and no comment was given by the waitstaff on the wait.

Otherwise it's great food, clean, and with friendly staff.  Highly recommended. :)<//Text>

The food is great the staff is friendly. I would give it 5 stars but the 3 times I have been there it took more than 20 minutes to get my food, so if your not in a hurry it's worth the wait.< /review>

Order at the counter, but they bring your meal to the table. Complimentary chips and salsa, very good. I had Mezcal Burrito Wet, and my wife had Sopas. Both very good. $$</Text>

Love this place. The food is good but it's really the staff that are truly stellar!

Went to dinner with my friend and her extremely finicky 4 year old granddaughter. They were happy to accommodate our requests for Scarlette and even came up with a suggestion that made the child's meal even more perfect for her.

I ordered the steak fajitas but what was delivered was chicken. They very graciously and quickly corrected the order. My meal was excellant as well as the margarita.

Thank you Mezcal for a lovely meal. I'll be back whenever I come out to visit my friend.<//text>

The lunch crew today had very bad customer service. My parents come here every other week and they were so disappointed today. The waiter we had was very short and kept telling us to “hold on” when we had a request (which was for a straw). I won’t be coming here again. Also the music was too loud. The food was good and so was the chips and salsa but we were very disappointed with the staff today.< /text>

<review>The chef is so consistent.   I've  resorted to ordering the daily special as it is always solid.   Clean establishment,  well staffed,  kitchen is efficient and solid.  Great value as well.   Salsa bar is awesome.   This is the type of Mexican place that Davis needs so bad.    A sit down,  traditional Mexican restaurant.    We have plenty of taqurias  but it's just not the same experience.    Awesome place that has only gotten better in the 11 years I've been eating lunch here.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

<Text>First time to this restaurant today and I would definitely go back again. I ordered the sopes meal with chicken as the meat. Everything was seasoned well but not laden with fats for flavor. I really enjoyed the freshness of my meal. The portions were great, I was not overly full nor under fed. My only con was the sope seamed just a tad over cooked but it was still delicious</Text>< pics>

Best ground beef taco anywhere period. Put the ground beef on everything,  so good . Carnitas are good but ground beef is special . They cook it well done so its crispy beefy goodness. Rice and beans also top notch .</review>

Delicious food! They served each of our plates as they were ready instead of bringing them all at once, which means we had fresh food. We had a very kind server who was also quite helpful when I couldn't figure out what I wanted. Had the Carne asada fries and they were delicious!</Text>

The mood of the place was perfect, if you want a ethnic experience you're getting it. They got comfy padded wall seating and the food was absolutely amazing.

This isn't your El foressto or Aldebertos or Carolinas burritos,  they're unique and the first bite into that Asada burrito reminded me of home cooking.  The taste of the beef reminded me instantly of family events and the fresh cows we'd chop up and cook.

Service was most excellent as well, very attentive and accommodating staff.<//review>

The food here is great! I ordered the Mezcal Burrito, the temperature and atmosphere was also really good. They have a chip bar for you to serve your own chips and choice of salsa, their drinks seem to be limited.. But as such! Great place overall! I recommend!<//review>

I love this place, it's super close to my work.  I always get their chicken enchiladas.  Good sized portions.  Clean restaurant.  Friendly staff.  Yummy salsa bar.  The surrounding location is a little meh, but overall a nice place for foods</Review>

The food is flavorful, seasoned, beautifully presented, and consistent. The servers are excellent and recognize my family and me, and entertain my young daughter briefly. They even have kids meal options. The Camarones a la Diabla are so spicy, I just love the endorphin rush I get from it. Mezcal really rocks it with the flavors and good portion size. I highly recommend this outstanding restaurant!< /review>

My wife and I love this place.  The atmosphere is good, but most importantly, the service is outstanding.  Favorite plate over there is the Enchiladas Mole plus the food is never bad there. I highly recommend the restaurant</Text>

I had the sopes plate with the side of beans and rice. The food was great and was a great value. The server was friendly and the restaurant clean. They also have a large salsa bar that is clearly labeled with a large variety and spice levels from mild to hot.<//Text>

<Text>This place is unbelievable. The staff is friendly and attentive, the food is seasoned to perfection, portions are huge and the price makes me feel like it's 1980 again. I could eat here every day. The new location is immaculate - seriously, I would eat off the floor it's so clean. The Molcajetes are the best thing I've ever eaten. Just go. Don't think about it. Go now.</Text><gmap_id>0x809ad6fb3b363d77:0x2dce3e55a9fb3f62< /gmap_id></record>

< Review>
Been coming in since they opened many years ago. The food has always been great.
SERIOUSLY have tried atleast 75% menu and everything has been on point and tasty. You can even make some of your own requests too.i really like there mole sauce and have gotten it put in a quesadilla and got a burrito wet style with it, covered that burrito with it. So good. The shrimp salad is amazing too. Loaded with grilled marinated shrimp and has a mango vinaigrette.
Ayce nacho bar comes with your orders.
They also have kids options too.
Plenty of parking and service is great!</Review>

Really friendly staff and pretty good food, especially for the neighborhood. Their seafood is particularly good, but other menu items are also above average. Prices are above a cheap taqueria but still very affordable.< /review>

Tasty, appetizing, delightful, scrumptious, heavenly....some words to describe my relationship with Mezcal

With my love of  Mexican food, I was excited to find a little gem in the neighborhood of Natomas. Great  burritos, chimichangas,  tostadas, tacos...amazing dishes that always makes it hard to decide what to order. I remember my first thought when I had my first meal, I knew I had to bring everyone here. Everyone that I've brought here has  loved it.

Everything made here is exquisite and their service is excellent.<//text>

Mezcal grill is definitely a little more catered to "American" tastes than other options nearby, but mostly in terms of the decor. Their menu has a lot of classic Mexican dishes, including mole, regular and "street" style tacos, and a whole bunch of other stuff that looks great. I usually stick to the burritos though, both because I'm poor and the main plates are a little pricey, and the burritos have never disappointed. They never go too heavy on the seasonings, if anything it tastes lighter than most other burritos, if that makes sense, the flavors are well balanced, and I've never had a messy burrito (no one wants a messy burrito).  They have a good variety of salsas, but I've never gone for any other than the standard pico de gallo and green stuff (I gotta figure out what it's called) because they're outstanding on chips and as a garnish on whatever you're eating.  This place is my go-to for all of the above reasons.<//review>

<review>I decided to do a review today which I will also do one on Yelp as well. The last 3 times I came here my order was wrong which is upsetting. I decided to call in and order today when I did the service was very rude he sat the phone down and didn't say anythjng. I decided to just come on in and order. As I arrived Fabien which was on the phone and took the order over the phone which was never placed. He was so rude and once I placed my order he went to the back and spoke in Spanish and everyone looked out the window at me which made me very uncomfortable and also questions if I even wanted the food after that. My normal expirence is ok I come all the time but I won't be back the food is ok but not all that for me to pay 40$ 50$ Everytime I come to be treated so poorly and rude if your African American be aware they will not treat you equally as they treat another race Fabien needs to be fired he has a bad attitude poor customer service he was eating the entire time speaking in Spanish and had bad attitude I think he's in the LGBT community and for that he should be more humble considering judgement ECT Fabien your service was poor and your attitude was extremely rude.</review>< Pictures>

<Rate>4<//Rate><Text>This is the spot! Quick and friendly service, the perfect amount of caliente (just a touch) to their dishes, very flavorful! Their guac could use a lil' more avocado, especially since they charge like $2 for a tablespoon amount. Chips could also be better. The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is that they use peanuts in the mole and they don't mark it on the menu. Also, they don't all seem aware that the mole contains peanuts (one person said yes, another said no). This is a bit frustrating since peanuts are the #1 food allergy in the U.S. and the deadliest food allergy.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

<text>Came here for a birthday dinner. It's somewhere in between one of those casual Mexican restaurants where you order at the counter and get to enjoy all the delights of the salsa and chips bar, and a full blown fancy restaurant where your every whim is catered to. This place has a bit of an upper crust look, and it tries to travel in the same direction with it's fancy menu as well. This was perfect for a birthday celebration feel. I tried the Chile relleno plate, my husband got something with shrimp, and my mother in law got the nachos. The nachos were loaded, no doubt. I didn't try the shrimp plate but my husband said it was good. The Chile relleno was as I expected -- the truth is I have to realize I'm just not much for the blandness of the Chile relleno plate where bite after bite is the same. It's not that I don't like chili. I do. I love spicy peppers. It's just... Like I said, you take one bite, you have taken them now. Now let me say though that it was coated in a delicious red sauce. However.... It was fully coated. So it left no difference for comparisons. The waiter who assisted us was very nice and pleasant and attentive to refilling our drinks. We brought our little one with us also and the restaurant was very accommodating. Overall a pleasant experience, but perhaps should have tried a super burrito or their tacos instead.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x809ad6fb3b363d77:0x2dce3e55a9fb3f62</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

The food here is great!!!!  This is a hidden gem...close to downtown. At this point I can say this is the best in Natomas and North Sacramento...They also serve a variety of wine and beer!!!!<//review>

Decided on Mezcal via Google rating and really enjoyed it while in SAC overnight. Really friendly service and the Pastor Mezcal burrito was fantastic.< /Text>

<text>This place offers fresh options. I love their tortas de azada. The bread is freshly baked, veggies are fresh and meat is tender. Their complimentary chips and salsa are also great. Prices are slightly higher than other mexican restaurants, but their service and ambience is great.< /text>< date>

Excellent food. I work close to this restaurant, so coming here often is easy for me. It has a lot of good food, and I've spent time ordering a lot of different things on the (continuously improving) menu to get a really good idea of the food variety they have to offer here.

They have great meats here, my favorite probably being the chile verde. I love that you can get it in a burrito! That's a standard order of mine. Lately I've been branching out and getting crispy tacos with al pastor, carnitas, carne asada, etc. They're all great. They have outstanding shrimp tacos as well, that have a bit of spice mixed in. A wonderful tomato-based sauce goes with 3-4 large shrimp in each taco.

The salsa bar is pretty good, and while I like spicy foods, the flavor of the mild salsas here are better, for me, than the spicy varieties.

The rice and beans you get with meal plates are standard. They're not amazingly special by any means, but they give you what you're looking for when you get rice and beans: carb-y bites of nicely-done rice with creamy refried beans, and a touch of cotija on top. Standard, and good.

Yes, I'd recommend this place.< /text>

<review>Great food, but a bit over priced and I ended up with an 18% gratuital tip being added to my bill with only 4 people in my party when the waiter only brought food out. Drinks are self-serve so such a tip should not be acceptable.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>{'time': 1535320635654, 'text': 'Hi there. Thanks for the feedback. Gratuity is optional.

When the food came, I knew I was spot on. I ordered the super nachos with carne asada and taco salad with carnitas. The portions were more than enough even if you come in starving and they are generous with the meats. They use romaine lettuce rather than iceberg like most other taquerias so that was a plus. They also have a chips and salsa bar that you can help yourself to. The avocado salsa was simply amazing! I repeat, amazing! Much thicker and creamier than I've had elsewhere and even had chucks of real avocado still in there.

If I didn't live so far from this place, I would be a regular.</Review>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) Good service I liked the right one of the waiter and I recommend the broth of 7 seas I felt the rich flavor that should be served in a broth and the whole seafood unlike other places previously visited the seafood has touched me almost or half I almost recommend seafood mashed.

(Original)
Buen servicio me gustó la correcta del mesero y recomiendo el caldo de 7 mares le eh sentido el sabor rico q se debe optener en un caldo y los mariscos enteros ah diferencia de otros lugares antes visitados los mariscos me an tocado casi o bien la mitad o casi puré de mariscos lo recomiendo .< /text>
