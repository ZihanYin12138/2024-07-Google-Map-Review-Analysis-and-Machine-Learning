< Review>
Good place for a professional massage at a good price. I have unintentionally encountered a few other places where a different profession was their primary profit source, so I have come to appreciate HDS as a place for real massage at good prices. I recommend tipping well. I am sure the pay is below the value of the service.</Review>

It was more painful than relaxing. Had to tell masseuses’ multiple times to lighten up. Incredibly rough. It felt like they grinded their way to the finish line. This is a discount “spa” and respectfully not returning.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>Feeling a world of hurt worth of body aches, and this place had decent reviews and reasonable prices. I’m fairly familiar with Chinese massage, so when I was introduced to Kevin, it was little wonder that his English was only better than my Mandarin speaking.

Kevin was fantastic!  He didn’t need to really speak to me, and he found all the kinks, took his time to work them out with a combo of strokes like the usual therapists I see. He didn’t rush and was thorough especially on the most painful parts.

The “combination” package has 1 hour of body and 1 hour of foot for $75. Really, it was about 1.4 hours of body and 0.6 of foot, which was exactly right for me. I am definitely getting this same therapist and package again next time.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

This location is the worst.. They all smoke so there for it smells like smoke inside the place, even my clothes smelled like cigarettes after I left. I saw employers walking around without masks on I walked out without actually getting the massage and the guy chased me outside begging me to come back. No way I will ever step foot back in this place.<//Review>

I've been here many times!
So soothing, peaceful and wonderful.
A "foot massage"  starts with soaking your feet in warm water while they start massaging you from the head, neck,shoulders, and the arms, down to your hands!
Then you're nice warm feet get massaged including your calves up to your knees and then as an added bonus you turn over and they completely massage your back and neck and shoulders!!
This whole "foot massage" takes one whole hour!
I don't think that the workers make very much money by the hour so make sure you really tip them!
$10 or more.
Make a note of your favorite people so that you can ask for them by name when you come again! If you request somebody by name, you might want to tip them even more. My favorite, favorite people I tip at least $15 sometimes $20 if it is super unbelievabley fantastic!
and once you start to be known in there as a good tipper the massages which start out as fantastic, become out of this world!< /Text>

Cheap. But not a proper massage. Communication was poor. They didn't ask me anything about where I was tight, where my knots were, what discomforts I was seeking relief from. It just a one size fits all theatrical massage. YMMV.</Text>

I am their customer for last 4 years. They have been excellent all through but my last visit and my visit today were not up to the mark.

The staff has been totally insincere- while massaging they were so busy whispering/talking  and laughing- the foot massage was useless. If you can relax there may be you would be able to relax in an office hour light rail.

I saw the staff joking about a lady customer who was a bit over weight.

I am so sorry to see an excellent place go bad</Text>

I've come here often for the famous foot massage which I really like.  Today I and a friend tried the swedish oil massage.  We found it to be as good a massage experience as fancier and expensive spa massage places.  The masseuse did an awesome job of locating and working out all those obnoxious achy knots.  I think it's an awesome value, I recommend this place to friends all the time.</Review>

<user>107756006106117178899< /user><Text>the happy day spa is absolutely amazing. my family and I went there for foot massages and they give you wonderful massages for a very cheap price. It is very clean and the rooms are so quiet and relaxing, with nice chinese music playing quietly in the background as you get massaged. I highly recommend for anyone looking to relax and get their whole body massaged really well. My masseuse was frank, and I can not recommend him enough to anyone who wants a firm, yet not too harsh massage.<//Text>< Rating>

<text>I’ve been here once and it was a decent massage. Came in again and will NOT come back due to sanitary concerns. I walked in and the front waiting area smelled so bad I heaved.

I understand there’s inevitably going to be the presence of body odor, but this was like decay smell-rotting flesh.

If you do not believe me go in and see/smell for yourself.

I inquired about if an air refresher can be used and no movement or attempt whatsoever.

If one goes in for a massage one should at least be able to breathe.

Thank you.</text>< pictures>

Orig review 8/'18, & revised review 8/'19 the same:
-- 3 Star service: Nothing stellar, but they are consistent and polite in getting the job done of relaxing the ol' body.
-- The great room containing 12 beds tends to be noisy with customers coming/going/talking/snoring, and the workers being heavy handed (noisy) with handling the foot-soak tubs and metal riser racks.
-- The workers also tend to sniffle (like a nasel drip) and throat clear throughout the entire massage. And, are heavy handed body work versus touching drop arm vs. setting it back on table.
-- 4 Star price: cash prepaid pack of 10 one-hour foot massages (in great room, but entire body with under clothes on gets done) is best way to go. Pay before service. Get what you pay for. Tip booklet given to patron post-service to leave cash tip--or, can give credit card at receptionist for tip.</text>

My experience here was awful the man who gave me a massage was very firm to the point it was uncomfortable, and most disgusting is he kept thrusting his penis (errect) into my hands and around my body. I feel completely violated and you bet I'll never step a foot into any massage salon.< /Text>

Nothing for size small. This store discriminates against petite people even though the demand for size XS and Small is high. Even in new items, there is no size 0 or 00.< /Review>

<Review>Love the the fit and style of express clothing.  One thing I don't like are their prices and their "deals," which still turn out to be quite expensive.  Nevertheless, this is usually my go to place for formal and semi-formal attire.<//Review></record>

They need to fix their automated voice message. Called to see when they're open, it said 9am. I show up and get a different answer saying they're open at 10am. What's up with the disorganization? Not cool.<//text>

If you like sea food  and grate service this is definitely the place to come. The owner is really kind and takes good care of her costumer's and makes sure they are well tooken care of while you are enjoying some really great Aqua chilles. I highly recommend it it's my wife's favorite place to go and mine as well.<//review>

Love coming here, food is always fresh and made to order. The same lady is always there, and always friendly. Tostada Mixta is my go to every time, leaving the crab meat out and it never fails to satisfy my mariscos craving!</text>

I called to place an order I was not done when the lady hanged up on me. I called back to tell her I wasn’t don’t ordering she answered me with an attitude and she said “ yeah you already told me what you wanted” I told her I wasn’t done. I told her to cancel my order. I rather give my business where I’m treated like my money matters! Never again going there.< /Review>

Very friendly staff and service was fast. Delicious food! I highly recommend the shrimp tostada. Best sea food spot I’ve found in Los Angeles area. It’s in the corner of the street (hidden) but easy to find once arriving to the location<//review>

<review>I loved the shrimp tostada, it's super fresh and raw, pickled in lemon. So tasty! I also had 7 seafood soup, several large shrimps, 2 mussels, plenty of octopus, and fish. Yes I realize that's only 4, but my favorite 4. Rice was good with soup, as well as the carrots and thinly sliced potatoes. I brought home a giant shrimp burrito for my dad and he loved it!

And yes this place is easy to miss Bc it is tucked into the corner of the oddly shaped mini mall.</review>< Name>

<review>The staff is very friendly.
The menu pricing is inexpensive.
The menu is limited, but overall really good.
I've tried everything on the menu many times, it's ALL REALLY GOOD! ☺<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Friends and I came for happy hour. Cajun fries were delicious. The potato egg roll was interesting. It tasted like a smaller deep fried potato skin. The sauce was not ranch, but had a kick to it. The nachos were alright. It was topped with black beans, Pico, sour cream, and cheese. I won't order that again but I would try other things on their menu. My friend had their sliders and that looked good. Unfortunately, he didn't let me have a bite so I had to drool up close.

I didn't drink this time around, but my friends had more than one round of drinks so I assume it was good.

Maybe 5 TVs, with one game that has sound, inside the restaurant. And most importantly, the staff was friendly and attentative. A lot of things I liked about this place that I will be back.< /Review>

Awful food. The ceasar salad came undressed with sides of ranch and vinegrette. Had to actually ask for ceasar dressing which we then had to toss ourselves. The burger was "fine" but the obvious pre frozen fries were soggy and inedible. Joke of a restaurant.< /Text>

Just for your own knowledge all Fries are typically  frozen before they are actually cooked, do you think they just sit out in the fridge? We go through 20 cases a week of fries, where would they actually go ? Should we just go to Idaho get a bag of potatoes and cut them each time you come in ....  This is a “joke” of a review .'}< /resp>

<review>Amazing food and service!   We switched from a nearby place where we were not being served at all because the kids were starving. They were super conscientious and attentive.  Food was amazing! Owner was here and super friendly!  I had a great derby mule.  I eat mostly vegetarian so I had the potato egg rolls and house made black bean burger with salad.  Amazing! Kids loved the grilled cheese, sliders, and garlic fries! Wife loved the chicken wings and wedge salad with beef brisket.  The place is impeccably clean.  Can’t wait for dessert!  Another great Franco Find!</review><rating>5</rating><pictures>None< /pictures></record></dataset><record>

Nice people. Severely understaffed and only one cook. Out of Cabernet. Waitress has not come by in 20 minutes. Pitiful on 10.27.19. Good food though. Will come back.

Edit - in response to owner - did not know employees had been evacuated. Feel bad for them. Tough day for them. Will be back. Folks were nice and food was good.

Edit 11/10/19 - Went back today as I said I would. What a pleasure. Service was perfect, bartender was perfect and she had only been there a week. Do not pay attention to my review from two weeks ago. The fires caused the employees a hard time so they were short staffed. Definitely will continue to go back. Super nice folks.< /Review>

Will not return.. Just got off work and all i wanted was 1 drink. My coworker and i stood in line for 30mins just to wait for 3rd bartender to clock in..  Two bartender decided to ignore us while greeting guest that had just walked up. Tbh i really feel as if i was being driscrimitated due to my race.

Waitress was nice enough but seemed to be a little overwhelmed and stressed.  Both bathrooms were a mess!  Had a burger which was NOTHING special at all.  Habit for 1/3 price was better.

<Review>Horrible! One hour for two beers, 40 minutes after ordering told they were out of veggie burgers. Food was cold, awful, what a waste of money. Everyone was upset with service and wait times. Will never go back. Left and went to Elliott’s for six dollar mega poor cocktails and served in 2 minutes!!!</Review><Time>1531596722634< /Time>< rate>

<review>Here we go.... Food was decent. But when the wait is long and the price is high, food taste a little bit worst than it actually is. I paid $50 for 2 tostadas with scallops. Only been there once I dont know if irs always like that or I happened to catch them on a bad day. I wouldn't mind trying it again ONLY if someone else is paying the bill next time lol<//review>< pics>

I love this place. The food is delicious, I love that they have homemade fresh corn tortillas. I've had their shrimp ceviche and various shrimp plates and they all have been good. Definitely recommend.</Text>

Quality of food is under par and is not fresh, I ordered Agua Chiles and took about 30 min and the place was empty,  to top it off the waitress was having an intimate dinner with her boyfriend on the job.... Horrible will never come back or recommend them... stay away<//text>

(Translated by Google) I went to pick up my order by phone and when I accidentally went to the bathroom, I heard a fat lady talking to someone from the kitchen staff very ugly and arrogant. It is not fair to me that they treat badly people who work very well food but I think they should improve

(Original)
Fuy a recoger mi orden por teléfono y cuando pase al baño sin querer escuché mire una señora gorda hablándole muy feo y prepotente a alguien del personal de la cosina. No se me hace justo q traten mal a las personas q trabajan muy buena la comida pero creo q deben mejorar</text>

<Text>This is a hidden gem.  It's a small place and from the outside it might look like an average strip mall Mexican food place but do not be fooled, the Carnitas are some of the best I have encountered in my travels.  Friendly service.  The place inside is very small so I would suggest takeaway, this way you can enjoy at home and not be afraid to unbutton those pants after your 3rd serving.</Text><user>110288048283544547182</user><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

Food was delicious.. However, it was very hot inside. They had the door open but the grill just made the place too hot. It also took about 15 minutes to get our food and drink. A bit Pricey but very very tasty.< /Text>

Pretty decent food fair prices but they're is one item that keeps me coming back that you all need to try and it's there Lengua Tacos I've never have Lengua this good before this is the some reason I keep going back must try. For those of you who don't know what Lengua is or those of you who never eaten more extravagant parts of a cow don't look it up try it first then look it up I promise you will thank me later don't possibly scare yourself away like some people even I at first was sceptical until my pops secretly had me try it and I'm so thankful he did lol. Get the Lengua Tacos<//text>

Great food will be a 5 star but don’t have a system in place as far as a wait time waited over 50 minutes for 4 Medunos and they told me it was going to be 20 minutes, my advise is to call before you come here they do have great food though just no customer service or management skills</review>

Best tacos Ive had in a long time!! Highly recommend this place. The chick and carnita tacos I got were great! The facility was clean the staff was very polite. They just got a new regular customer< /Review>

The carnitas here are great. The taquitos are good as well. I love getting the pound of carnitas and taquitos. The rice is also very good here.< /review>

The hot sauce was soooooooooooo good, spicy but so good with the chicken. and who doesn't love Hawaiian bread? I also bought a lemon cake that was delicious!. I'll be returning.

P.s. i like legs🍗<//Text>< pictures>

Appointment made for mammogram, ultra sound and bone density test.  Easy to make by phone.  Facility is beautiful and clean.  Quickly seen by front desk and taken in the back waiting room area.  Mammogram tech and physician were very efficient and thorough.  Next bone density tech took me to exam room.  Super nice, explained the procedure and it was done in less than 15 minutes.  The best part...got my test results later the afternoon of the day of the test.  Go to Memorial - they are THE BEST.< /text>

Beautiful facility to have a breast exam, mammogram, and ultra sound. The technician was very professional and compassionate. She explained every step of the process and even told me what to expect in terms of discomfort. The waiting/changing room is peaceful and clean, it almost feels like being in a spa. In order to have my appointment I had to wait more than a month but it was well worth it!</Text>

It was my first time at this facility and had a wonderful experience. As soon as I entered the building I was kindly  greeted by a gentleman who directed me to the location of my appointment. Once there, the staff was very kind efficient, and very friendly. Kindness is always important, and even more when in places like this. The technician who performed my mammogram was kind, friendly, and very gentle! Overall an amazing experience!< /text>

The most pleasant experience for a necessary annual exam. The rooms are new and beautiful. Lovely robes and waiting rooms. It was like being at a spa! Truly a great experience. I forgot to mention the lovely staff as well. My exam person was Pat who made the experience of the actual exam feel like it was nothing at all. The equipment was all new and high tech with no discomfort what so ever.</Review>

The office is beautiful, they called me back on time, everyone was very professional, they called me the day before to talk about my out-of-pocket expenses so I wasn’t caught of guard. My favorite part was the detail of having a beautiful picture on the ceiling to look at. That is so easily over looked and it makes a big difference when you are stuck on your back. Whoever designed the office did a fantastic job and put a lot of thought into it!< /text>

My Dr. Reffered me to Memorial Care Breast Center. They got in touch with me to make the appointment and got me in within days of the referral. They are all very friendly and professional.  The facility is very clean. Parking is very accessible and check in was fast.. I was there of an ultrasound
&  biopsy and even though I was worried/nervous, I was put at eased because everything was explained so thoroughly...thank you Sandra (Tech) & Dr. M.Sardjono</Review>

<text>I have been getting my routine mammograms here since I moved to Long Beach three years ago. Even during the pandemic they are providing quality care. This most recent visit i was seen at my appointed time, scanned by a pleasant professional, and my doctor had the test results the same day. Highly recommend.<//text>< Pics>

Actually, since there were fewer people waiting than in the past, there was almost no delay. Everything was clean and streamlined, and the staff was friendly and upbeat. My only complaint is the $6 charge for parking in their lot. (I parked across the street...)< /Review>

This is a very clean, well organized office. The staff is very friendly and the entire office is VERY quiet and relaxing (almost spa like). The front desk ladies are quick and get you checked in efficiently. The technicians in the back are friendly and do their job painlessly (which is a big plus). I left the office with a smile on my face😁< /Review>

I love my Doctor, Phyllis Oster, and her recommendations. Was able to squeeze in a Bone Density @ the same time. The site is very welcoming.  Staff and nurses/Doctors are tops!

Memorial Care breast center is the most wonderful experience in every way.  Not only is the facility beautiful and filled with soft, feminine art, the lobby and waiting room are bright and open.  The dressing rooms are clean and pleasing and comfortable.  Every effort has been made to create a soft, welcoming, pleasant experience.  The staff and technicians are polite, helpful and efficient.  The only caveat is the small parking lot.  When it is busy, you might have to park in an adjacent lot or on the street, but there are lots of options.  I highly recommend this facility.< /text>

i GO HERE EVERY YEAR AND THIS WAS WAS DIFFERENT.  i WAS ORDERED BY MY DOCTOR TO GO ANOTHER CENTER AND i JUST COULD NOT DO IT.  i CALLED THEM AND THEY COULD GET ME IN AND MY AUTHORIZATION WAS TO GO IMMEDIATELY.  THEY ACCOMMODATED ME WHICH TRULY IS A BLESSING.  i AM COMFORTABLE THERE, AND THEY TREAT ALL OF US WOMEN WITH DIGNITY.  NO WORRIES, NO EMBARRASSMENTS, AND THE ROBES ARE PERFECT FOR THAT KIND OF SITUATION.   i HAVE BEEN ALERTED TO HAVE THE WHOLE BODY SCREENED BECAUSE i HAVE OVER SIX PLACES IN MY CERVICAL MRI SHOWING MULTIPLE MYLOMA OF MY BONE MARROW.  IT IS GRIM, AND SAD AND NON CURABLE AT THIS STAGE.  YOU CANNOT TELL UNTIL A FEW THINGS START TO HAPPEN.  WISH ME LUCK, AND TO YOU ALL.....  i WISH THE BEST FOR YOU TOO!</review>

For the first time getting a mammogram this office set the bar high. The staff was friendly, efficient, and made the exams as comfortable as possible. The dressing room and waiting room had a spa like feel and the low music they had playing was a comfort.</text>

<Review>It’s a beautiful facility which makes you feel welcome and at ease. The staff is very professional and caring and takes good care of all of us who are there to have a mammogram.
I just have two complaints: the chairs in the second waiting room (holding room just before having mammogram) are extremely low and close to the floor and people like me who have difficulty walking also have difficulty getting up from a low chair, and even though I’m short myself (5’2”). So I’m sure it’s also difficult for others!
My other complaint is the horrible robes that are given to everyone. They are heavy, hot and very uncomfortable. If you take one side off in order to have that breast X-rayed, you can hardly manage to keep the other side on due to the weight of the robe. I wish I had a lot of money, because if I did I would purchase all new robes to give the Breast Center for the comfort of all the patients who go there.<//Review>< pictures>

The people at the Breast Center were friendly and I was processed (paperwork) quickly. When I was called in for the actual  mammograms and  other test, I was in and out in less than 20 minutes. The staff was very professional and they were very kind.</review>

Overall I really appreciate the time, care and attention to detail that memorial care provides their patients.  I had a couple procedures last summer and the radiology doctor was wonderful and kind.  This month I went back in for a follow up and the radiology doctor was not as kind or understanding as last time.  She was very casually throwing around that she does not know what my condition is and how "weird" my condition seems; even saying "she has no idea if my condition grew or not because she can't tell where it starts and stops".  This would be perfectly fine if she had spoken to me about it in a professional and educated way but it was said in a very condescending manner and like I was wasting her time.  She couldn't give me any definitive information (which is OK but leave it at that and don't throw around words like "weird" and suggest other conditions that NO OTHER doctor has every suggested to me over the last 10 years of care I've had).  As a healthcare professional  myself I found it very UNprofessional and not compassionate.  When you are dealing with any patients, ESPECIALLY patients with breast-health concerns, nonchalant and casual is not that way to go. I am HOPING she was just having a bad day because I really, really liked and trusted her last year.  I will be back and the techs are AMAZING, just disappointed.  Off to my breast surgeon and hoping for a better experience.  Overall I'm not upset that she doesn't have all the answers (that's for my breast surgeon), but this is a very sensitive topic and it's my health that I'm trying to keep up with.  I was saddened by how burdened she seemed with seeing me and answering my questions.<//Text>

This is a  well organized cluster of offices to obtain your regular breast mammograms and follow through with surgeon and oncologists, if their is any abnormality.  The centralized care makes it easier. Every one involved with Breast disease is of high caliber, the Physicians, technologists, nurses and volunteers.   Thank you.< /review>

As usual, MBC patients were given the A+ treatment.  The waiting room and exam rooms were spotless.  As a  "senior" patient, I was given help, if needed, to get on/off an exam table, etc.  The techs and office staff answered any questions I had.</review>

<rating>5</rating><review>I was scared. I had a planned biopsy. The assistant Ms. Sandra was so attentive! I expressed my fears & concern to her, & she immediately put me at ease. I thank GOD for her! The actual procedure took less than 10 minutes. They made me as comfortable as humanly possible. Thank You ladies, from the bottom of my heart!<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

Your  tech was very professional.  Her manner is gentle in performing the mammogram making me feel comfortable and calm. She has a very nice upbeat attitude a well. She is definitely an asset to your Breast Center at Long Beach.< /text>

The customer service was phenomenal and straight to the point. The parts clerk/cashier provided information that made my core exchange easy to understand and set my expectations as to when I'll receive my refund. Highly recommend to anyone, novice to veteran mechanics<//Review>

The clerk cost me an extra hour on my trip to town. Went to pick up parts for son in law, grandson went in the store to pay for and pickup the parts he was told the parts weren't there yet come back in the morning. We left and headed to our next stop we were 30 mins away and son in law called and said parts were there. Got back to the store and they said oh we had them but weren't sure about letting you pick them up waited for us to leave and then contacted son in law to see if it was ok for us to pick them up. So we were almost to Oroville in bumper to bumper traffic and had to turn around and go back! Because of traffic we spent an extra hour driving. COULD HAVE CALLED son in law while we were there and saved us time and gas! Very ride and annoying!!<//Text>

UNITS is GREAT and I highly recommend them.  They are a local company and treated me very well.  I tried to call a national company that offers the same services and was treated like a number.  Well not UNITS.  Dee runs the storage units and delivered a storage unit to my driveway.  We filled it over the weekend and Dee picked it up the following week.  Dee is great, on time, friendly, honest and punctual.  I prefer using local companies and UNITS is exactly why I prefer this.  Highly recommended.<//Text>

<review>I was very impressed with UNITS. Weeks after I made my reservation, I wanted to change the drop off date. I needed to start my renovation project a week or so earlier than planned. UNITS were able to make it work, and dropped off the storage unit earlier for me. They also price matched, which was a plus. All together UNITS met and exceeded my expectations. I would gladly use them again in the future.</review>< Pics>

He has superb skills as a driver and last week we got to see his excellent managerial skills as he coordinated the schedule with us.  The pods were clean, in excellent condition and kept our belongings dry and safe.  We couldn't ask for anything more.  Thanks Dee!<//review>< pics>

This is the third time we have used Units to move us and I couldn't be more pleased. The staff is professional and courteous, making it easy to schedule the drop off and pick up of the Units. The Units are clean and safely stored until we were ready for delivery to our new home. They work closely with the packing company to make for ease of communication and scheduling.

I highly recommend Units Moving and Portable Storage of San Diego to anyone in need of moving/storage services.</text>

For most it’s a good company. When I had my Unit delivered I wasn’t asked what position it should be placed in the parking lot, fortunately, there was enough room to maneuver the trailer and it turned out okay. It got better when Dee had taken over the operations. I would recommend them to a friend.</text>

This company put a storage unit in the driveway of our neighbor. The pictures speak for them selves. I was concerned for the safety of any kids or pets who might happen to crawl under there and retrieve a ball or something. This looks highly unstable and is too high off the ground! I called Adam Martin at Units, and he told me they have never had any problems with liability and have never had an accident. All it takes is one accident and a fatality, Adam!  Do we really have to wait for that before this company will come and fix this? When I first called him, his attitude was "that's how we have always done it." That was not comforting, so then my dad called him from out of town (after seeing the pictures I sent him), and the guy gave my dad the same song and dance. Then my dad mentioned Units would have a lawsuit into the millions if someone gets hurt. Adam finally agreed to send someone to fix it. We are still waiting. I also had the police call Adam as well, just to make sure this gets fixed. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY PLEASE!</review>

<review>Adam was flexible and wonderful to work with.  We had to make some schedule changes and there was no problems.  The delivery and pick ups were right on time and exactly as arranged.  I would highly suggest UNITS of San Diego.  I’ve used them before and they were great so we decided to use them again and Adam did not let us down.  If we need storage in the future, we will definitely use UNITS again.  Thanks Adam!!!<//review>< Pics>

So far I've only rented a storage unit.  Service is good and prices are reasonable. I would recommend this place to friends.
UPDATE 9/10/2020, I wanted to add that my wife and I are moved and UNITS has our containers in their storage. "D" in San Diego is the man to go to for all your moving needs in short distance transport. If you need long distance transport he can hook you up with KIM who is their long distance Coordinator. They provided local movers in both California and Arizona to assist with loading and unloading our containers. I will update with the info after we finally move in to our new house.</Review>

< Review>
I have used 3 different companies over the past 4 months to clear out the estate from my parent's home.  Units was the 3rd company.  I booked the listing through the location in Charleston, SC and specifically worked with "Jody Howell" to book the trailer.  I have not had this outstanding of customer service is the past 10 years... in any industry.  She was compassionate, friendly, efficient, thorough, and simply kind.  I give the highest praise to this company for employing such people as Jody.  Kudos.< /Review>

<review>UNITS Mobile Storage provided exceptional customer service! They helped make a stressful move so much easier! They were right on schedule with pick up and delivery and didn't provide a large window of delivery/pick up times as their competitors typically do. Thank you to Lisa, Grace and the rest of the UNITS team! I am a huge fan and will refer you to anyone moving or remodeling in the San Diego area!< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>The reviews for other mobile storage services scared me. So with a little more research, I came across Units SD, who had great reviews on Yelp. I'm happy I chose this local company. They had great customer service that made the whole process easy. The drop-off, pick-up, and final delivery were smooth. All of my belongings came back in the same shape I packed them in. This was so much better than driving back-and-forth from a storage unit on move days, and I found the price to be comparable to a first floor "drive-up" storage unit. I was still able to access my stuff in between moves, if I wanted to.<//Review>< Pictures>

<review>UNITS! UNITS! UNITS! UNITS! UNITS!!!!!!
I researched costs all around town and Units was the choice. I thought I might get what I payed for in customer service but the Staff and Drivers were 100% professional and showed up when they said they would. They were able to perform delivery and pick up in the time frames I provided. I found the items that I stored in the Unit exactly as I had left them when I opened it up. Units Mobile Storage is the only call you have to make when moving or storing your belongings<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

SD Units Mobile storage is the best. They work with me when I give them very little notice, they pick up on time and their customer service is great.
They also help the local San Diego Habitat for Humanity affiliate with donated and discounted units.< /text>

I was not blown away by the flavor and although, the patties are made well and cooked well, I can honestly say that some competitors are just better at the "smash" style of burgers. The service was good and and speed wasn't terrible so there's that.<//text>< date>

<review>Amazing, delicious burgers! Not too greasy, not too much sauce, pickles just the right thickness that and didn’t distract from the burger itself. I got mine without onion and looooooved it!!! My boyfriend got everything on his and said the onions were diced and were perfect amount of onion. We split an order of fries with cheese sauce on the side. I normally and not a fan of cheese sauce, but wow, this was so good! You can order the cheese sauce on the fries or in a cup on the side. I would recommend the cup so you can control how much cheese is on each fry when you dip, and then maybe save leftover cheese for chips at home. Splitting the fries with my bf was the perfect amount of fries for me, didn’t feel too full.

Also, Boylan sodas are so good! I got black cherry, and my bf got root beer. So good!

The staff was super friendly! And our order was ready way faster than they estimate, which is great. There’s parking behind and next to the building. We appreciate that all the packaging was paper, no plastic!< /review>< name>

Regular burger: pretty good. Two crispy smash patties w sauce and pickles. The flavor is great but it's missing that umphhh. Maybe more veggies?

Fries w cheese:
The fries are sooo good. The cheese sauce is alright; a bit too much for me. I got it on the side and am glad. I definitely have leftover cheese.

Sioux City prickly pear soda:
Pretty taste and sweet. It tastes more like strawberry than prickly pear but still good.

Maine root blueberry soda:
Tastes good, but I think the blueberry kind of tastes like medicine. Can't drink too much of it.< /text>

<date>1610938907729</date><Rate>5<//Rate><review>Very tasty burgers and fries, made with quality ingredients. They have this amazing cheese sauce for the fries too. It is so good, the best in LA. You can just taste the love and care that goes into that sauce. It is nice and thick and perfectly coats the fries. You can get the fries with cheese on top, or you can buy it by the cup. With a cup of this heavenly cheese you can dunk your burger AND your fries.  If you buy extra cheese sauce, you can take it home and make gourmet level macaroni and cheese. I highly recommend Burgers Never Say Die.< /review>< pics>

< review>
I came here on a Wednesday night around 7PM and there was no wait! The burger was delicious! The best part for me was the crispiness on the edge of the patty. The fries were great also! The only downside is that there’s no restroom here but other than that everything was good. I would definitely come back.</review>

A long overdue return to our favorite smash burger spot! The focused menu may be small but it's quality over quantity. The well seasoned ground beef patties are consistently juicy throughout and crisp at the edges, remaining true to the simplistic ethos of a smash burger. Simply finished with diced onions, ketchup, mustard, american cheese and some delightful sliced pickle. Ordering two is a no brainer. The fries might be the best I have tasted, fried in beef tallow which provides loads of flavor, it nostalgically reminds me of british chip shop chips. Wonderfully crisp and lightly salted their taste can hold their own if that is all you ordered. Paired with a cup of their in house cheese sauce it truly is a great flavor combo. Service is always warm friendly and Covid-conscious. It's a great experience that I wish I could do more frequently, enjoying top quality patties and fries off the warm hood of your car.</Text>

<Text>Really good burgers and fries. Awesome selection of drinks.

Burger has two thin smashed patties with delicious crispy edges. Fries are similar to McDonald's style but bit higher quality (and a lot of them!).

Only reason I give it 4/5 is price for what you get. Really delicious, but for $8 a burger it's a bit steep.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

The Fries were good. Plentiful and put inside a small paper bag.
The hamburger were a different story.
I have read the reviews and I was anxious to see  what the hoopla was about.
Yes the burgers are very thin and grilled to a crispy finish. I ordered the double but the thickness of it came to a regular burger size.
I don’t think I’m going back.(I live in the valley) to come all this way for this style of burger.
People like this style by the evidence of the long lines.
Is it a fad? No!! It’s a good burger!!< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><username>Oscar G</username><gmap_id>0x80c2c748eebd79e5:0x35d71da5acdb75fa< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Great place to have a burger! Not really looking to turn vegan, but I will admit they were very delicious and could not tell our whole meal was plant based.  We loved the cheese they used which is the Follow Your Heart brand. My wife and I are in the search for the same cheese since she loved it that much.</Text><user_id>118276390736559591086< /user_id>< GmapID>

<Review>I have been to BNSD many times and every time I go the food is made not only consistently but is always so freaking tasty and delicious. It's crispy on the outside, seasoned to perfection, soft toasted bun... You can tell that all the ingredients are thoughtfully put together. This is the type of restaurant where they make one thing and make it well and I hope they can continue to do so for a very long time.

The customer service is always friendly and helpful and yes, the wait tends to be long during peak hours. They are a busy restaurant for a reason. This is why I recommend you CALL AHEAD! The food is always ready for me at the given time slot and I don't have to wait.

This is literally my favourite place to get a burger.<//Review>< pics>

<Text>There is not much more that I can say that has not already been said! These burgers are absolutely delicious. They remind me of a burger from Shake Shack but with a taste that must be experienced to believe! I highly recommend. The wait is long but worth it. Call ahead to make sure that you arent waiting too long. I also tried the fries which are adequate and do their best to not outshine the main attraction which are the burgers that never say die!< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

It’s a very basic burger with super thin meat patties, I don’t understand why folks are hyping this place up. I also got the cheese fries and it was just terrible basic fries with a ton of that cheese that you’d dip your large carnival pretzel into or your nachos. Eh... too bad. Also if you’re going to disregard this review, make sure you have at least half an hour or more to spare. There will be a line, and it will move slowly. Down to one star from two. Owner is a joke! Regret ever spending a penny at this place. Incredibly unprofessional customer interaction & clearly has a low self esteem because they clearly can’t handle criticism. Insane.

<Review>This restaurant has the best burgers in town if you specifically seek a McDonald's-style double cheeseburger. The staff work very hard to keep up with the high demand, yet the cashier will always greet you with joy and courtesy. The business model is like seeing the hipster child of In-N-Out burger graduate with an MBA from UCLA and then take the family tradition to a fun, new direction.<//Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM4oLMov_Yl2gMuSvF4clQG7SLQyvyQ9dwWwY7T=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< response>

Burgers Never Say Die was a beacon of shining light for us during the first parts of quarantine. We would drive 30 minutes just to pick up their food, eat in our car, and drive 30 minutes home. It gave us something to look forward to and was our special treat every once in a while. It was delicious and correct every single time. I wish we could eat there every day...!

I also appreciate that they are serving their customers to the best of their ability while still taking safety precautions and procedures seriously for their staff (and customers).</Text>

One of my favorite burger places in the entire world! I learned about it from watching 'Worth It' from Buzzfeed.

The burger is absolutely amazing. The burger patty is crispy on the edges, buns are nicely toasted, the fries are fried in beef fat!

The menu is very simple and the staff was attentive.

Every time I've been here (4-5x) there has been a wait. The longest I waited was 20 minutes in line and 20 minutes to get the food. It is well worth the wait!

If you're in the area, this is a MUST TRY!!< /review>

<username>Mira Edorra<//username><time>1599054505598</time><rating>4</rating><text>5 stars for the classics burgers, 3 1/2 stars for the fries, and a solid 4 stars for the service.

I called in my order since I think it's better to support the restaurants directly during these times, not a delivery app. When I called in, the voice on the other end of the line was really nice, friendly, and helpful. I went to pick up my burgers and parked in the lot, which was quite busy. I arrived 5 minutes early and was told to wait. Definitely order ahead, this place is hopping.

Let's talk about the food. They offer double "smashburgers" and quad "smashburgers" which were on the smaller side, but packed with flavor and crispy edges. Just cheese, onions (which I asked to be taken off, but they were still on there), pickles, ketchup and mustard. Super classic style burgers, and extremely delicious. The fries were on the soggier side, but still pretty good.

Overall these burgers are quite good and I would definitely go back!!<//text>< Pictures>

What a warm and inviting atmosphere for customers. This is definitely a place I want to support.

Just kidding. Never spending another cent here. Maybe tone down the authoritarian mask enforcement and you’ll get more business.<//Review>

Had to try based on hype didn’t live up to it IMO taste similar to McDonald but price and wait much higher also not much info about product sourcing so I would guess quality is same as McDonald’s too I’d rather have in n out personally updated review due to bitter response sorry both your burger and fries taste almost identical to McDonald’s homie</text>

Favorite place to get a burger in LA. Fries are killer, soft serve ice cream is makes me feel nostalgic. Get 2 burgers, you'll be full after the first one, but it's so good you'll crave a second.< /review>

Delicious hamburgers that brought me back to a simpler time of non-corporate hamburger stands.  The slight crispyness to the char on the burger made the taste really pop. The process could be a little more efficient as it takes a while to get your food. The fries were really good. All in all winner.</Text>

The burgers and fries are good in this location, but I've tried many locations and cooked my own flat burgers as well. The price is way to high and reminded me of Five Guys since everything is separate instead of offering combos. Still a good burger place, but in my opinion, I can hit another joint and grab several burgers at that price.</review>

<Review>This is our go to place for burgers fries and a beer!!
They have great gluten free burgers and sweet potato fries! I love that I can get grass fed pink burgers and my SO appreciates that she can get here's well done.
They have cider and great beers on tap.
I've never had to wait to long for service or a table,  although I've seen it get pretty hairy on a Friday night at 7pm</Review>< username>

<Review>My friend put me on game about the original spot in Russia, so when we heard they have a location here in LA we just had to try it and I have to say it was pretty good! The taste was definitely different but in a really good way and the burger was juicy which was a major key point on why I gave this burger such a high rating.

<review>Elevated McDonald’s - the meat quality is much better and the texture of the meat is better as well. Really sweet customer service but waiting 30 mins for this wasn’t worth it. Would be nice to have more lettuce or something fresh to cut through the greasiness of the meat. And it’s expensive for the size and quality. Definitely an overhyped burger place in silverlake< /review><response>None<//response>< Time>

<Text>Nothing here was really bad, but nothing really wowed me either.
The burger s pressed flat (as is their intentional style), and we waited ~45 minutes (basing this on hearing 12 songs on my phone until they called on us), for our order : 2 basic cheeseburgers, 1 side of fries and 2 bottled drinks.--granted, they did warn us when we ordered that they were backed up, so I appreciated the heads-up, but to wait over 40 minutes for a flattened beef patty with American cheese  and 2 pickles, I was expecting to be blown away with something really unique.

Overall the service was nice, and the food was good, but not really incredibly remarkable. Will come back in a year to give them another shot.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Simple. Classic. Uncomplicated. And yet, their virtually non-existent menu and severely limited options seems to work, as not only was this recommended, but it was bustling. I think my personal question has to be why, because while other places are making delicious, massive burgers, Burgers Never Say Die seems like the mantra for how long they will cook that tiny, thin little patty.  The burger might not have said die as it passed from edible protein to a black cracker, but it did in fact die.</text>

Good God this was the best burger I've had in LA, bar none. 2 Thin crispy patties with melty cheese and really simple toppings at a good price. Their fries are bomb too. No fluff, no crazy options, just eat the damn burger and ascend to heaven 😂 can get quite busy some days, go go go!< /Review>

The burger was amazing. Very high quality meat, well seasoned, cooked to perfection. Wings were big and meaty. I want to call out the huge amount of thought that went in to how the items were packaged for delivery. They cleverly keep the bun, patty, and toppings separate, and the result is that it ends up looking just as good as it would at the restaurant. I will definitely order again.</Text>

A friend told me about this place a year ago and I've been meaning to get there for a while and we finally stopped by. It's delicious, just like everyone told me. I think what makes this place unique in today's food industry is it does the basics extremely well. They aren't trying to reinvent the burger, just make a simple burger tasty enough to not need to be loaded with ingredients that may or may not belong on a burger. I think the best way to describe it is a hand crafted McDonald's style burger but with the highest quality ingredients. The patty is a flavorful, crisp smashburger style that's still soft on the inside. The regular is a double and was the perfect size. I would even say fries are similar to McDonald's but a little thicker without the weird aftertaste or grease. The prices are fair and they have CVT soft serve. We will definitely be back soon.</Text>

The GREATEST Burgers of All Time. Doble recommended this place and he's right. This guy knows his food, so we go for his birthday and they are the best burger in SF, probably in the world. Well Big Mouth makes a great Hangover burger too, but really really delicious.

It's a Whole Lotta Food!</review>

It's a bit overpriced but it tastes like a solid smash Burger, also it takes quite some time to get the order out. Fries literally came in a bag lol but was tasty. Would go again if I'm in the area.</Text>

A great spot for a simple burger done really well. Menu is very limited, and portions are more reasonable. Roughly $10 for a hamburger and drink. Not a smashing deal, so it won't be a regular place, but definitely a place I will return to for a treat.< /Text>

Very yummy, esp if you love sloppy messy smash burgers. Better than shakeshack because of the double patty, not as bready as an in-n-out double-double. Price is in between the two. Final touch I’d love is chili peppers for the lift; I will probably bring those myself next time.

Would go back, but would not wait in any crazy lines.</Review>

Saw the recommendation on tasty’s YouTube but it’s literally a steak and shake burger at a higher price point. I ordered 2 regulars (double cheeseburgers) and 2 sides of fries. All totaled out to $25 total. Their ice cream machine wasn’t working(?) waited 20 minutes whereas a Steak ‘n Shake drive Thru, they would’ve been about 3 minutes total wait time and 10 dollars less INCLUDING a drink. Makes me miss the Midwest 😪 I’m spoiled< /text>< Pics>

<text>I'm eating my way around LA's best burgers and Burgers Never Say Die is definitely near the top of the list. The burger is two super thin smashed patties with awesome char and extremely flavorful. Every bite is delicious. The fries are standard fair and you get a lot with your order, but I would probably just stick with the burger and like they say order two. So far I would probably only place The Apple Pan over this spot. If you're visiting LA put these burgers on your must try list.<//text>< pics>

Limoncello is my favorite neighborhood sandwich spot! The Speciale sandwich is my go-to. The sandwiches are all made with fresh ingredients. The shop also has cool imports from Italy like nocciola (real nutella). The owner Chris always has a smile on his face :)</Review>

Ordered a regular and Twisty swirl ice cream ... this is not my 'dream' burger but it was good. Reminded me of a Mickie Ds double cheeseburger from the dollar menu. I'll stick to In n Out.
Ps Brady's OMFG and Chocolate Chip Cookies were dynamite and were awesome with the soft serve Ice Cream.</review>

The staff is amazing! The food doesn't disappoint. For me, the burgers are a little on the salty side, but they surely are delicious! The menu is pretty much burgers and fries and some specialty sodas, but sometimes the best is....simple. Definitely a regular stop.<//Text>

<Text>Downtown in a door with lots of other food options to pick from which is great in case your party wants to try different foods. Ordered a burger here and the taste was worth taking my time to write a short review. The meat was just juicy enough to impress me, might be one of the best burger patties I've had to far in LA and I've tried a lot.

Staff was very quick and food came out in a reasonable amount of time.

Great for the price which does not include fries but we ordered some loaded fries which added value to our meal for sure.

Make sure you get a seat before you have to stand!< /Text><gmapID>0x80c2c748eebd79e5:0x35d71da5acdb75fa</gmapID><Time>1583769873808<//Time>< user_name>

San Francisco's hidden gem, unless you're at the hotel across the street or with a local you'll probably miss this one. That's regrettable. The burgers are unique, tastey, and filling.

Best fries ever, get any combination of two: fries, rings, sweet potato.

Also for the lesser portion option get the quarter pounder! I'm a fan of options :)</Text>

Wherever you live in the greater Los Angeles County, this fine, savory eating establishment is worth the drive. The staff is amazing. The burgers are amazing, the fries, drinks and shakes are excellent and you must definitely have the bacon wrapped tator tots. Don't just have one, order 3! Believe me, it'll be well worth it.<//review>

<Text>When I visit Los Angeles CA, I eat at Pearl's Deluxe Burgers. I would come just for the fantastic crispy onion rings, but the burgers (I prefer the bacon burger) are also great and the shakes round out my meals in a truly satisfying way for just over $20. If only I lived closer than Indiana! Seating is extremely limited, so plan to come either before or after the normal meal times or be ready to carry out.< /Text>< pics>

Pretty good. Glorified McDonalds is accurate. But it’s something about the burger that feels shake shacky too me, maybe the buns and the patty. But the pickles and onions with ketchup are just like McDonald’s. Something about the way the patty is made, every bite is fantastic and feels much more authentic than a common McDonald’s burger. The fries are somewhat better than McDonalds, they are for sure more salty but they are fried lighter, and I didn’t have a single burnt fry or a soggy one so, 5 out of 5 for fry execution.<//Text>

< Review>
My favorite burger place in Los Angeles! I love it love it love it! The smash burger is delicious and flavorful and everything that a burger should taste like and the fries are to die for!
Few annoying things about BNSD though but it’s not food related: 1. they have a tiny parking lot, so finding a spot in the area can be a little annoying. 2. They don’t have restrooms 3. Very limited seating
But these 3 things don’t stop me from going there twice a week, I think I’m addicted!<//Review>

There's something about these burgers that I just can't explain. It's the purest and simplest burger you've ever ate, and I think the simplicity of it all brings out its true flavor. Their menu is also short and a sweet. They only serve burgers, fries and ice cream. They've added cookies and trinkets to the menu, but you know you're there for the burgers.

They come out with two flat patties, cheese, raw onion, ketchup, mustard and pickles. The patties are somewhat crispy which I find the be the whole charm of the place. It's a fun bite, and because of the lack of fancy condiments, it takes you back to more nostalgic times. It also reminds me of a McDonalds burger, except made to order!

Seating is all outdoors, and a few benches are found inside. They do have a small parking lot, but it does fill up quick. Street parking is available, just make sure to put enough time in your meters! This is no drive thru!

Keep in mind that because everything is fresh and made to order, the wait is usually out the door! You can't order ahead, so you have no choice but to wait approximately 30 minutes for your delicious burger!</Text>

<Text>The burger is not too bad but the stuff is very vey rude. They have unorganized system of taking the orders, they don’t separate their pick up and order lines which creates confusion but in the end the stuff is uncontrollable and literally screaming at people for no reason. There was like 10-20 people on the patio standing and waiting around and everyone witnessed and agreed how inappropriate the stuff handles the orders, outrageous. I won’t be visiting that place ever again and will suggest to all my followers on social media platforms to avoid this place and take their money somewhere where they make better burgers and stuff is actually reasonable.</Text>< Pictures>

<Response>{'time': 1597930787436, 'text': 'Another "influencer" makes broad, sweeping generalizations that aren\'t true, threatens to go tell her followers. Then goes on Yelp and writes multiple fake reviews to make it seem like her followers wrote them. The give away was the same spelling errors, and the fact Yelp removed the fake reviews without us even asking Yelp to them do so. It\'s like we\'ve never had to deal with this kind of behavior from an  "influencer" before. Nina, did you actually talk to all 10-20 people standing on the patio regarding what they witnessed and agreed upon? Was it more like 10 people? Or more like 20 people? Because the difference between 10 people and 20 people is significant. Or, was it more like just the two guys who were trying to pick you up and using the situation that you caused as an opening to talk to you? We watched the surveillance footage and none of what you claim happened. This is the second time you\'ve caused multiple problems with our STAFF and during this most recent visit, you now caused problems for other customers because you refused to step aside so they could get their orders. You\'re no longer welcome here. So take your self-absorbed, entitled "influencer" attitude back to a Tiktok party in Hollywood Hills and leave it there with all the other "influencers" who think they\'re way more relevant than they actually are. If you come back, you will not be served, and will be told to leave. Screen grab this, put it on social media for all your followers....we don\'t care...we\'re just wondering though...how many of your followers are actually real and not paid for?\n\nYou\'re only "famous" to the people who know you.'}<//Response>< GmapID>

It's a good burger. It has a charred taste, thin and has crunch when you bite it. With everything on it, it's a good one. I had my kids with me and I did a cheeseburger with a single patty and ketchup, and another single Patty and no added items. Both tasted great, with the plain one tasting like a summer backyard BBQ. The fries and soft serve were the hot for me as they complimented the whole taste. Perfect combo of salty and sweet to satisfy those two cravings. They do take credit card. The seating is limited and the order wait times are approximate. Friday @230pm the wait time for the order was 30 minutes, but ours came out faster even though it was 3 burgers, 3 fries and 2 soft serves.<//Review>

One word to describe this place.... Delicious. Burgers cooked to perfection. Fries are awesome as well. Downside only is that this place is always packed so expect to wait 15 to 20 minutes for your food. Met the owners and they were chill. It was also cool to know they came from the IE just like me! I would definitely go back and recommend this place to all my peeps.</Text>

<review>Not bad, not spectacular. Burgers are small and expensive. Fries are good, good quantity but also expensive. Burger meat is very thin and sloppily made. Also takes a long time for burgers to be made, likely because of the hype. Try it and see if you like it for yourself.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

<text>First things first: one of the best thin patty burgers hands down. Best fries as well (if u like in-n-out fries I'm not talking to you anymore). The only bad thing about this place is their price, and their slogan. "Always order two" when ur burger is not filling and cost $7.50 is kinda hard to read unless u rich. And it's literally the only thing to watch since the place has a street food feel which is quite cool. Cool and cold. Since sitting only outdoors. I am wearing sandals and can't wait to be back home. Anyhow, the place is good and among my favorite burgers in LA.

The burgers and fries were really good, but the place itself is not the best. The smash burgers were crunchy and had a great flavor. The fries were crunchy and didn't get soggy. The food was honestly great, the problem is the restaurant is small. The wait is long and there aren't a lot of places to sit. Would still give it a try. The burgers are solid and the fries are perfect.</Review>

<review>Good burger, nothing extraordinary,  I paid $16 and change for 2 double cheeseburgers no fries no soda,  that are a little bigger than a McDonald's double cheeseburger... overpriced hipster burger joint offering good classic small burgers< /review>< pictures>

Burgers are good but they remind me of a mcdonalds double cheese burger: 2 patties, 2 cheese, pickle, onion, mustard and ketchup.
I traveled 20+ miles just to try it and it was worth it. The fries were just the right texture and saltiness.< /text>

<review>This place is definitely worthy of all the praise it gets.  It is easily one of the best burgers I've ever had. It is a minimal masterpiece that will leave you wondering how such a simple burger can pack so much flavor. The way they make their patties is unique (as far as I know), they smash them until they are thin. This process results in a patty that has a unique, yet extremely satisfying texture and flavor. The edges of the burger have a delicious crisp to them. I could go on and on but just go check it out words cant describe this burger. Some tips tho: seating can be very limited so go ahead and eat in the parking lot or in your car, there is no shame in that and plenty do it. Things can add up quick here, keep costs down by ordering one order of fries per two people, they are very generous with fries here. Also they can triple or even quadruple stack the burgers if you ask!< /review>< Pics>

I went here because I heard online that these burgers are unbelievable. Their average. What's unbelievable is the price. $8 for a standard burger that is a double cheese burger. With one piece of lettuce. This taste like a normal hamburger you could get anywhere else for half the price. Save your money.</Text>

< review>
There’s something about these burgers that I just can’t explain. It’s the purest and simplest burger you’ve ever ate, and I think the simplicity of it all brings out its true flavor. Their menu is also short and a sweet. They only serve burgers, fries and ice cream. They’ve added cookies and trinkets to the menu, but you know you’re there for the burgers.

They come out with two flat patties, cheese, raw onion, ketchup, mustard and pickles. The patties are somewhat crispy which I find the be the whole charm of the place. It’s a fun bite, and because of the lack of fancy condiments, it takes you back to more nostalgic times. It also reminds me of a McDonalds burger, except made to order!

Seating is all outdoors, and a few benches are found inside. They do have a small parking lot, but it does fill up quick. Street parking is available, just make sure to put enough time in your meters! This is no drive thr

Keep in mind that because everything is fresh and made to order, the wait is usually out the door! You can’t order ahead, so you have no choice but to wait approximately 30 minutes for your burger!<//review>

<review>This is the perfect execution of a McDonald's cheeseburger and fries. But done in a smash burger style, with beautifully crispy edges and well seasoned (nice and salty).

The fries are perfect.

Just love this place.

Only gripe is the wait time is a little long.</review></record>

As I've said before in past reviews, I'm in a gourmet burger club. We get burger all over LA, and this burger is hands down my favorite. The burger is very simple, and the fries while also simple, are absolutely amazing. Similar to McDonald's fries, but a little softer. I was pleasantly surprised, and the staff is super nice!<//text>

As for the food, Ladyhawk and I both like the food.  It's not bad at all.  The buffalo burger I had was totally satisfying.  I wouldn't say this place wow'd me with it's food, but the other intangibles made up for it.

I'd, like, totally suggest this to people in the area who want some food fast.<//Review>< Resp>

The burger is so delicious! Perfect size-perfect brioche bun-just yum! Fries are great but large portion-can share. They need to buy more tables to sit at. Amazing!! Will be back:))<//review>

Thought 2:30 on a Saturday might be a good time to visit.  Was told there would be a half hour wait. Found instead it was a 45 min wait. Burgers are good, but not exceptional.  Slightly charred/crispy edge with a McDonalds Cheeseburger texture /flavor (soft flat burger mixed with melted cheese). Generous amount of fries (somewhere between In-N-Out and McDonalds - a good thing). Chocolate Ice Cream was the highlight - rich and flavorful. Nowhere to sit, so it had to all be consumed in the car.<//text>

I've traveled around the world in search of the perfect burger, and let me tell you, this is as close to the Holy Grail as you can get. In terms of under $10, down and dirty, simple burgers, this is #1. The way the burger patties crunch and the American cheese oozes out, covering the entire mouth, alongside the punchy pickles and McDonald's style diced onions can only be described as an orgasm in the mouth. Perfect bun to meat to cheese ratios, great fries (close to McDonald's), and good people. Simple. Minimal. Tastes like nostalgia. Just remember, always order two.< /Review>

<Text>Burgers ever say die is good. It isn’t great. If I was in the area I’d come. But it doesn’t compete with in and out at all. Prices are decent burgers aren’t filling the moto is buy two burgers. Which doesn’t make sense, you end up spending a bunch of money. Anyways quality is good but just go to in and out, doesn’t stand up to the hype<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Traveling from Arkansas and watched a video about the top burger places around LA. This was no lie, I was worried that it wouldn't live to the hype, especially for 7.25 a piece. I bought 4 because I thought they were smaller. My girlfriend could only eat one and it was 10pm so I did waste one unfortunately. The cheese so amazingly gooey, the taste is so good, the crispy one the outside and juicy on the inside meat. Just an incredible burger and story< /review>

This place is located in easy location to get to from anywhere in LA.Best buger I've ever had close to In N Out for one of a kind taste. Has a nice size parking lot. There could be a wait but the service is great and fast.  Only reason this place doesn't get a 5 star from me is due to the price of the burger much higher than usual. In n out wins bc of price.< /text>

Kind of an overrated boutique version of the McDonald's cheeseburger. Very similar just crunchy texture to the beef. Better bun. Better quality. But it ain't much different. Fans are just fooling themselves because they are too embarrassed they like McDonald's 😀</Review>

Lunch with my sister and her first experience here. We walk in and its roughly a 45 minute wait. My sister wasn't too happy but I told her just trust that it's worth the wait. We hung out messing around with everyone and all of a sudden our order was ready without a minute to spare. Think my sister was ready to kill me. About ten seconds in to to that first bite and my sister looks at me and says, this as an absolutely perfect burger. No BS, special sauce or artisan bun. Just a great burger. Ridiculously happy, we packed up after stuffing ourselves full and off we went. Believe the hype people, these burger were amazing before they opened the shop (in case you've had one before they opened) and they're still just a great burger. Do yourself a favor and stop by. Sure there will probably be a wait but its definitely worth it. Just have some ice cream while you wait.< /text>

~$11 will get you the classic burger and fries combo, which is more than worth the price. Smash patties, soft buns, raw onions, mustard and ketchup work together in their simplicity. The fries, thin but not shoestring, and crisped perfectly. Just a great burger and at a reasonable price.</Review>

Great smash burgers! If it's your first time be sure to order 2 and the fries are big enough to share between 2 people. We went around 6:00pm on a Saturday and the wait was 30 minutes.< /review>

<Text>Dang.  Solid burger... Super delicious and juicy.   The fries were fantastic and I dipped them in their AMAAAAAZING habanero aioli as well as the Burger shop sauce which is probably one of the tastiest I've tried.

I was going to knock off a star due to ordering my burger medium well and receiving it barely medium - lots of pink, but the burger was still super delicious.   The bun was a little dry and maybe old, but I also was the last order of the night.   This is a must-try if you love a good burger!<//Text><rate>5</rate>< GmapID>

Def a great place, i can see why it was on Eater. The Burgers were juicy and perfectly cooked, full of flavor. The cheese was melted in with the ketchup and onions. Wish i would’ve ordered two to honest.The fries were so fresh and fried to crisp. My boyfriend and I topped it off with a Dr. Pepper and a strawberry Fanta. It made a delicious lunch.

If you get a chance def stop at this place and give it a shot.</review>

I have tried a lot of burgers. This place is officially in my top 3. Loved every bite of it. Seasoned perfectly. And such a perfect balance of anything. I'm from Jersey and I've had a lot of amazing burgers in NY. Definitely check this place out. I'll be back.<//Review>

Recommended by my coworkers so decided to try this place during break fast time time around 7:30.  Ordered the cheesy burger medium done with garlic fries.  The burger was delicious, the patty was so juicy and flavorful.  The garlic fries was also great.  The place fills up pretty fast around 8pm. Burgers Never Say Die< /Review>

Our burgers are cooked one way (we don't offer medium done) and we also don't serve garlic fries. Just won't to clarify so others don't come in asking for garlic fries and their burgers cooked medium. :)"}<//response><gmapID>0x80c2c748eebd79e5:0x35d71da5acdb75fa< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Just walking along the street I wanted to eat a little and found this place. The food and service was excellent. Sweet fries are better than mine in other places, and the burgers they give with it are so good! Be sure to check if you are nearby.< /Text>

I'm still trying to understand what happens inside of an American brain as to why they get all over the top with certain things. It was a Mc Donald's cheeseburger but patty smashed with extra maillard reaction and oil. Literally. I understand and agree with the "minimal and quality" concept : the minimal was there but not the quality, so why that price? The staff seemed cool and the place had a family street feel to it. Good luck to them.</Review>

<Text>Update: In a previous 3 star review -I had made note of the greasy bun and the fact that they would not let me put notes on the order to make it perfect. Today I went back and asked for an extra bun -they did better than that. They sopped up the grease and put on a fresh toasted bun for me. I can now say without exception this is the best burger in LA, probably the best burger I've ever had.<//Text></record>

Awesome new burger joint in Silver Lake, very limited menu but executed to perfection. The burger manages to transport you happily and nostalgically to family barbecues or fast food after school, even though we all know this burger is far superior. Fries aren't to be missed either, but if you decide on a second burger instead, no one will judge you!< /Text>

Under normal circumstances nothing is worth driving to Silverlake. As a rare breed of Angelino that was born and raised on the west-side, we don't normally find ANY reason to drive to Silverlake. Burgers Never Say Die is one of the only reasons you can find me making this pilgrimage, sometimes MORE than once a month. I'm not going to sit here and express to you how delicious their burgers truly are, but don't miss out, you will not be disappointed.< /review>

Pricy and worth the cost. There is a great sitting area down the stairs in front of the coffee shop. Stop by the excellent and reasonably-priced coffee shop on the same trip.  Note that the burger restaurant does not have a restroom for customers, but the coffee shop does have a restroom for customers.<//Text>

Outstanding burger!  Very thin patty makes for a crispy crunchy bite that melts in your mouth!

Dont sleep on the fries here either, everything was like a gourmet McDonalds cheese burger and fries and i mean that in the best way possible!

Employees super chill also!</Text>

Keeping it tight with one fry, one burger, and two ice cream options. You may have to wait a bit for the food to come out, but it's worth the wait and we didn't come across too many campers in the seating area outside.  Each burger had two thin patties grilled to a delicious crunch, don't be afraid to follow the instructions and order two!< /Text>

I’d get a better burger from Ralph’s at a quarter of the price. In fact, I think they get the burgers from the frozen section at Ralph’s. Don’t waste your time!</review>

It was good. Prompt counter service only.  They read back your orders to you. Ordered two standard burgers and fries. They run out fairly early. Best to come early or check ahead before making a long trek. Off street parking available but limited. Very new. Very spartan. No public restrooms! In a mini mall w other bizznzs. Outdoor table seating only.< /review>

Wicked good burgers, great fries, CVT soft serve, weird cake-flavored Louisiana soda, fast service. I reckon each of those things is worth at least one star. If you combine them all, though, you should prepare to be totally chair-locked after you're done.<//Review>

Its 10:05pm on a Tuesday and they tell me the register is closed for the night. I thought closing time was midnight?

I would say this place is a glorified McDonalds. If you opened the top bun and
put it side by side with a McCheeseburger, they look the exact same. Pickle, mustard, ketchup, diced onions, american cheese. The meat does seem like better quality, but then again any burger joint has better meat than Mickey Ds.

4 stars for the burger, 1 star for closing two hours early< /Review>

<Review>Well I appreciate the appeal of the simpler burger, and stripped down menu. The price (~7.50) for a burger however, just doesn't seem justified. It's an ordinary fast food style burger, thin well done patty, (no med-rare here) and kraft singles. The fries were the most basic, frozen from the bag, shoe string fries you can imagine. $11+ for a burger and fries isn't expensive, but it isn't cheap either and there's nothing above middle of the road here. It's smaller than an In N out double double (which is cheaper) and smaller than any other gourmet style burger...
It's as if they brought the old flip style phones back but are charging you a premium because of how old-fashioned it feels.  (and oh how Instagramable!)
The wait can be long as well.<//Review>< pictures>

It's a very simple burger yet perfectly balanced in its simplicity:  buns, two smashed beef patties, diced onions, pickle slices, 2 slices of cheese, ketchup and mustard.  It's like a gourmet version of a McDonald's Double Cheeseburger.  The fries are almost spot on McDonald's too.  If you haven't tried this place before -- run, don't walk, to this burger heaven located in the Silver Lake area.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80c2c748eebd79e5:0x35d71da5acdb75fa</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>If McDonald's, sometime in the mid-80s, decided to beat In-N-Out at their own game, by paring their menu down to the bare essentials, while also focusing on elevating their minimalist cheeseburger to gourmet status (you know the one: thin patty, squirt of ketchup & mustard, micro-diced onions, neon yellow American cheese), you'd have Burgers Never Say Die (or BNSD for short).

"The Regular" is the name of the main event here: two thin patties ("smashed" in the local lingo, apparently to ensure the edges of the patty are perfectly crisp), gooey golden (not neon yellow) cheese slices, on a sponge-bread bun with just a hint of golden-brown toasting on the cut edges. Top it all off with the obligatory squirts of ketchup & mustard and a thin-sliced pickle or two, and you have a moment of near-perfect burger excellent that, alas, seems gone too quickly (perhaps I just ate it too fast).

Fortunately, the french fries are also approaching perfection. Served hot after being thin-cut and fried in beef tallow (McDonald's apparently only "flavors" them to taste like beef fat), one might even argue that they're worth a trip on their own.

Also very enjoyable is the soft-serve provided by CVT, in either chocolate, vanilla, or swirl. My disappointment that they didn't serve it to you in a cone quickly went away after tasting the first spoonful of swirl. The chocolate half is very reminiscent of Wendy's Frosty dessert, while the vanilla definitely has the edge over Mcdonald's soft-serve (although I'd still like to see a cone in the future).

My only complaint are the prices. Bring at least $20 for a burger/fries/drink/soft-serve meal. Ouch. I didn't mind so much after the first bite. Otherwise, it's a great new burger joint in L.A.

Recommended for both veggie-haters & meat-lovers.<//text>< Rate>

<Text>very disappointing experience. I drove 40min across town and when I arrived their payment machine wasn't working. They wouldn't accept cash. I asked Bonnie what they intended to do for the customers that were inconvenienced and she smirked at me and said "nothing at the moment". I left my name and phone number with a request for a manager to call me back. It is a real shame they treated me this way as I was very excited to try their food and the least they could have done was offer it to me on the house or taken my info and charged me when they were up and running.  I wouldn't try coming back here and I think its very unprofessional they didn't update their instagram to reflect their technical issues. I lost 1.5 hours of my life and they couldn't have cared less. I would have preferred to address my concerns over the phone but I am not surprised they didn't bother calling me back. They also have limited comments on their insta so beware of that. The general vibe I got from this place is that they are doing us a favor to let us eat here and no thank you to that.</Text><pics>None< /pics><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

A classic smash burger, one of two ways (with or without cheese). My partner and I have been here a handful of times and always leave loving the food. Only frustrating thing can be the wait times.

We’ve seen people leave over the wait times. Shortest it’s ever taken us was about 15-20 mins. Totally fine. Longest was the last time and it took us 1 hr 15 mins. CRAZY!! That said, we walked straight in to order—we’ve seen *that* wait take another chunk of time.

Order extra fries and some soft serve from CVT and you won’t regret it. Great burgers in Silver Lake, service is good (all the girls at the front are nice and doing their best), if there was only something to be done about the wait!<//Text>

BNSD is like chemotherapy; the results can be amazing but the process is painful, and longer than one would expect for a meal that only requires indirect heat.

26 min after ordering, I was aghast to hear the two burgers I ordered had been rung up as one!!

The woman with a taxidermy cheeseburger hat decided it wouldn’t be fair to expedite the second burger, and I’d have to start the entire process again.

It’s 52 past one, ticket 74 was fired at 1:04 and we finally have our intended order. Now I ask you burger baron, is this fair...

Edit with regards to the owner:

Your goonish tone does not intimidate anyone, it only makes you look pedantic and incapable of processing feedback to promote progress.

The fact is your POS only displays single items as they are rung in, then a grand total. Maybe get a square or toast display unit if it’s the clients responsibility for order clarification.

Sorry for not looking over the line item receipt, I wasn’t aware we were entering a binding agreement. Glad your hubris is intact with the help of your multifaceted surveillance burger shack...< /review>

OMG hands down best cheese burger ever! (from an innout enthusiast) Burger is on par with innout, the BUN tho is probably better than innout and fries are like a better version of mcdonalds fries.

Just the right amount of cheesiness, and simple toppings of pickles onions mustard and ketchup.

“Glorified McDonald’s”
It’s simple, although the burger was a bit much salty. They do give a pretty large serving of fries which is great.<//review>

<review>It's so overpriced and basic burger. It tastes like McDonald's mcdouble and costs 6 times more. The fries are the same as McDonald's but double the price.< /review>< Name>

For those who love burger in Los Angeles I would recommend this restaurant

The restaurant has a very plain design that takes you to eat and sits overland in shaded but tasty and cheap tables and chairs

للي يحبون البرقر في لوس انجلوس انصحهم بهذا المطعم

(Translated by Google) The burger melts in the mouth. It's incredibly hipster, quite expensive, but frankly very good. The portion of fries is quite large (at least for a non-American), easily share two. To test urgently, even to zap the in'n'out and other chains
