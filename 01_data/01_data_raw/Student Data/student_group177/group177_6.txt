Excellent office staff! Will work with you on appointments! Want an hour or two off from your kids and hubby ? Just ask for same day appointments!
They also explain all work to be done and are amazing at making sure you are comfortable. (My son said he felt no pain)
My son is having a good bit of work and though he was really scared of dentist ...He is so relaxed with this office.
The office staff and hygienist are always smiling and the whole office just gives a great vibe !</text>

The staff is so friendly! Dr. S explains exactly what work needs to be done and the reason behind it. The hygienists are amazing! They made me feel relaxed and definitely eased my nerves. Wait time was maybe 5 minutes!< /review>

Dr. Dastrup is very friendly and kind! I have had a lot of bad dental experiences and he made this one seem like a cake walk! His staff is also amazing! I cannot say enough about them. I appreciate all of the help that they gave me while I was there. Thank you Chelsea for being such a wonderful assistant! Thank you to all the staff, you made my experience better!</text>

I’ve moved out of Chowchilla since I started coming here and have continued to make the 30 minute drive to come out to this office because they are just that good! Dental offices I have been to before have never been as friendly, clean and comfortable.

The office had actually changed ownership and with the new change I have only noticed great things!! The new staff members are literally amazing.

I had a cleaning with Melissa on Monday and she was so great, so friendly! She was so knowledgeable, so helpful and so respectful with offering tips to improve my dental health!

Everyone was awesome with answering all of my questions, addressing all of my concerns and making me feel absolutely comfortable and listened to. The new doctor, Dr. Dastrup is fantastic and super friendly also.

I really couldn’t say enough positive things about this office. If you are looking for a new office or have been nervous to go to the dentist.. don’t be.. come to this one!! I 10000% recommend. 😊👍< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< rate>

<Text>Great people with a great service. Been coming here for years back when it had a different name. The main dentist is different now and so is most the staff except two personnel.  I really liked the older dentists but the new main dentist is a young family man who is very bright and well skilled.  Everybody is very friendly, knowledgeable, and does their job to the fullest. I’ve never had a complaint.
Thank you precision family dentistry for helping me maintain a beautiful smile.<//Text>< pics>

<text>Everyone was extremely nice and caring. I have been horrified of going to the dentist since a young age and everyone from front staff to back staff were very comforting and understanding. Dr. Dastrup was understanding of my fears and helped me to feel as comfortable as possible while there. The hygienist did an AMAZING job! She really impressed me with the cleaning she did. The numbing they gave me was pleasant and there was no pain at all. I 10/10 recommend everyone to come to this dentist, even if you had bad experiences with previous offices, he will help you through it all and understand you. They all made sure they were clear and informative with their responses to any questions.< /text></record>

Visited the office for my 6 month appointment. Jill is the best at what she does! I have been going to this office for years and Mark is the absolute best and I trust him in the care of my teeth. I am sad that Mark is not at the office anymore, but I am willing to give the new Dentist a try. So far so good. This office has been really good to me over the years and I hope it continues! Thank you!<//review>

Precision Dentistry was very clean and felt safe. All employees were pleasant and respectful. The dentists and hygienist were thorough, caring and interested in my best oral health. They also were helpful in suggesting on how to make my decisions according to the support of my insurance company. A patient for 15 years, I am proud to continue with them knowing they will do their best to care for me and my family.<//Review>

Although I have not been and I need to get in to see Jill, my husband Sergio goes regularly and Dr. Davis and his staff have always provided exemplary service and always go above and beyond to make the visit a seamless and enjoyable experience.  Jill takes good care of her patients and always provides the most up to date techniques with professionalism and a smile.  We drive from Merced to our appointments in Chowchilla and this is evidence of how much our entire family trusts the staff.  We wish we could give a rating of 100 stars because the entire staff deserve this rating.  Kudos and hats off to the staff for always doing a great job of taking such great care of our family.</Text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

I’m new to this area & I just googled a dentist in Chowchilla.   I’m so glad I went to the office of Precision Family Dentistry.  The staff is amazing from the front office staff to the x-ray person to Mark Davis DDS to the teeth cleaning staff.  They have quite a “team” as everyone works together.  I will definitely  stay with this dentist office.</Review>

I've been coming to this practice for a while now.  Everyone is knowledgeable, friendly,  helpful.
The staff is really great to greet you as you walk in and the facility is very clean.  The hygienists are gentle and I felt like my teeth were thoroughly cleaned.
I also decided to remove my old silver fillings w the composite ones.  Dr Dastrup is GREAT.  Very comforting and really good w the injections.  I recommend this place to anyone.  Give them a call.  They also provide very accurate quotes for dental work.. with or without insurance.</text>

The staff are always there for you. I called after hours, plus I was able to send a text message. As soon as Mary came into the office, she called and offered to have me come ASAP.  I was seen and relieved that my problem wasn't more serious. Thank you.</Text>

I’m writing this review at 4am because I cannot sleep due to the pain I am having from just getting fillings. I miss Dr. Davis. I know Dr. Dastrup will get there but we all need to give honest reviews. First, it’s the details. The fillings on my right side are smooth and we’re done with care, done by Davis. My new fillings are done sloppy and I still have stuff on my teeth, Dr. Dastrup. Second, Dr. Dastrup injected Novocaine into my artery. My jaw hurt more than child birth after the numbness wore off. When I went back yesterday  to find out this information I was told just to take ibuprofen. I’m nursing so Tylenol only. I can’t take any more Tylenol and the pain is a nonstop irritation now.  I can’t sleep. Going to work has been a nightmare because I’m a teacher and sub planning isn’t fun and even more when it’s distance learning sub plans. Last, I miss the music Dr. Davis would play. Now the music is a mix of my jr. high and high school rock show at the Paul Paul. Memories I don’t need while I’m hearing part of my tooth be sawed away.  Suggestions:  keep the fillings smooth and clean. Give pain killers when it’s obviously needed. Bring back the Christian music.  I was told I’d get a follow up call today, didn’t get it. Just furthered my disappointment.</text>

I didn't take pictures,  but the place was amazingly clean, organized,  good and attentive service, priced to match other places. They were busy but yet my son was in and out in a timely manner.  Will definitely recommend it.< /Review>

<text>I been getting my haircut for about 2 years now. I will recommend you to make an appointment is faster than showing up and hoping that no one else is there. It's always busy.

Great job Erika/Ladies 👍🏼< /text>< pics>

I'm still back to ask for a favor and I say in a good way that if they can fix you and get my eyes out and treat me in a very bad way ... if from the beginning they did their job well I would not return for rework, right ... but they do things wrong and they still get angry no pos wow less 6 clients thank you .... STOP STEP

(Original)
Ok muchachas! La verdad yo creo que si pago por algo me meresco un trato digno sin actitudes o feos modos...la muchacha rubia la verdad no recuerdo el nombre le corto el pelo ami hijo y la verdad me lo traskilo bien feote...todavia regreso a pedir de favor y digo de buena manera que si pueden arreglarle y me tuersen los ojos y me atienden de muy mala manera...si desde un principio hicieran su trabajo bien yo no volveria por rework verdad...pero hacen las cosas mal y todavia se enojan no pos wow menos 6 clientes gracias....PARESEN ESCALONES< /text>

(Translated by Google) I am disappointed in this place .. On Saturday I went to cut my hair and the truth was that the cut of some sides left me very well leaving long and the sideburns they left them very ugly..of course the one that I cut it is called VERONICA. ..

<Review>(Translated by Google) That place they charge you what they want, they don't have a separate flat rate once I tipped a girl and the owner stayed with her and gave her nothing

Bone his wife of the owner hahaha and if it was from some other stylist be sure that at the time it was given, thank God we are honored people. But thanks for taking the time and gifting me 1 star.

Such a beautiful park.
Greenery everywhere you look.
It has so many nice features, from a playground to barbeque grills, a number of clubhouses, a baseball field complete with  bleachers and a hot dog stand. There's the swimming pools too!!
There's lots of picnic tables and open restrooms.
And they've even added a bicycle dirt/ramp area for those who like a little bit more fun.</Review>

<review>We hiked the trail about side of Harvey West Park to the old pogonip Clubhouse. Moderate difficulty, beautiful nature. Be aware that there are some homeless encampments at the beginning. God bless them.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<Review>This park is really great. Lots of open space, well maintained. It's been a life saver during quarantine. I miss our swim lessons here, but one day soon, they'll be back.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x808e4034d4a23f0d:0x4aaa3c568cea2134< /GmapID></record>

The playground is really neat. The area is nice with the trees and stuff and the lawn is always nicely manicured. The location is just not the best since there's always weirdos around but there's always weirdos everywhere in Santa Cruz, so what do you expect. Great playground though and lots of trails to hike on around it.<//Text>

<text>Beautiful family park for all ages with a swimming pool that offers lessons baseball fields for the little league teams hiking trails with gorgeous redwood groves old oaks and a diverse range of wildlife plants and a wonderful place to have family celebrations and wedding parties There is large picnic areas a meeting or club house playground with an old train engine and a stage coach station for the kids . A Mountain bike trail and even a dirt bike track nestled in the back for kids and adults of all ages to enjoy. .they have special events and is a really SAFE well maintained friendly park that everyone can enjoy. Its been my favorite park all my life and I highly recommend the old EVERGREEN CEMETARY where the first  locals who settled here even before the civil war  have been buried . a very historical place that is alive with something for everyone.</text>< GmapID>

A nice city park with a playground,  pool, baseball and soccer fields, big picnic areas, and trails to adjacent open space and neighborhoods. Grass, Redwood trees, free parking, and an old steam locomotive. Near Costco and next to the historic Evergreen Cemetery< /Text>

<text>Love Harvey West Park. I have been coming here since the 1970's and it hasn't changed much. Still has the pool, but no high dive. The snack shack is closed, but you can bring your own. Baseball is very popular there during Spring and Summer. Check the county guide for activities at the park and pool hours. Very tranquil and clean. Also, there's a pump track for bmx.</text><resp>None<//resp><user>109015450473574930993< /user>< GmapID>

As a BMX rider, I can say that the jumps are amazing! The pump track carries great speed if  you can ride it correctly. Me and many others just helped out to rebuild it so head over there now as it is FRESH< /Text>

<Text>Harvey West Park is a hidden gem of a park in the very remote corner of an industrial/residential area. It offers a friendship garden, an old locamotive train for observation & photos, as well as plenty of grass, trees, & shade. There is an area for children to play, & there is a swimming pool facility. You'll find an old school BBQ area with plenty of tables as well. I like to come here to relax under the trees & get away from it all.</Text><Resp>None< /Resp><time>1558291904708<//time></record></dataset><record>

The transient types haven't been too bad lately but don't be shocked when you park next to someone who's been up all night working on their car and they're still grinding their tooths down to nubs. The cops patrol on the regular.
The pool is awesome and the bicycle pump track is often in good shape. Please don't ride it when its wet. It screws it up. Baseball field is that. Check out the old Cemetery. Bring the kids. Its trips them out to be in the presence of old dead people.</review><Pics>None</Pics><UserId.>112159628901490215487<//UserId.><Name>Kevin Onorato< /Name></record>

<Text>Such an amazingly hidden gem of a park in Santa Cruz County. It has a playground, a swimming pool area, an old locamotive train for viewing, plenty of shade or sun. There are picnic areas (small & group), with bbq's. There are also historical cemeteries.<//Text>< Resp>

Make sure you don’t leave your belongings anywhere here not even for a minute. We had a an iPhone stolen. It had a picture of our son in the case the screen saver was of our 2 year old daughter. We turned on the find my phone app and the GPS displayed it was still right in the area. After calling it and sending an alert the phone then shut off. We attempted to get help from the snack shack and the children in the announcement booth but they were of no help at all and showed no kind of empathy. A phone can be replaced but the pictures of our children can’t. Hopefully we never have to return here again.<//text>

<Text>I like this park and my kids do too. My only complaint is I wish there was a bench or two in the shade by the play structure. I also miss the train that kids could climb on back in the 90's. They removed part of it and the rest of it they fenced off.</Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMtNVHAIunIHJRSf7wE4Wvvzz3qKgbf-gzMUKNT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x808e4034d4a23f0d:0x4aaa3c568cea2134<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Reasonable price, quality of meats with basic side dishes. Marinated meats were really good and  probably the best price AYCE Korean BBQ in the area.</Text>

<Review>Was looking forward to checking out this restaurant, since I'm a fan of ayce kbbq. I was pretty disappointed! While the price was wallet friendly, the food and service disappointed me big time! First the meat - normal selections you would expect at an ayce kbbq so nothing special here to talk about. The extras were lacking - like there was NO lettuce!  The self serve bar was tiny and the fruits were from a can and had no fruit taste!  Second the service - the limited staff was definitely short on people so we had to wait long for the meat to come out. I sympathize with them but blame the management for it.  Over all, didn't really enjoy the experience and would NOT come back.  This is a shame since this branch is closer to me than driving out to Korea town.  Oh well, gotta go where the good food is!</Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOQNxgb7jifMvKrWbu2hwtfknINc2TsqqC8uiN0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< Resp>

This is the place when people want to spend minimum money for AYCE Korean BBQ in local area. It only costs $19.99 per person to get a different kind of meat and seafood. I love to eat beef belly, rib fingers, and pork belly because they have good quality.  Also, it has mini salad bar which I love to grab tofu, fish cakes as much as I want. The service here is great, and food always cone out fast as well.  Also, beer is not expensive here for a mud size so next time I may order one as well.

It is very good place for 2 or more people to come here for BBQ because it has good environment, good quality of meat, and services.< /text>

<Text>Awesome place for meat lovers. A little step away from traditional restaurants so if you are looking for something new and delicious, this place is perfect. Tons of different meat choices and a very attentive staff. The prices compared to other Korean BBQ's is pretty good too. I try to come here whenever I get a chance.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x80c2c55d6819a0f7:0xb4cb7b906de408</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

The food was amazing! The service was the best that I've ever had at a KBBQ! Well beyond what I would have ever expected. The quality of the meat was the best I've had, and the free salad bar was a huge plus as well! I'm definitely making it my new mainstay!< /text>

<Text>Friendly service and the waiter made himself available. The salad bar was laid out and presented well, but some of the items didn't taste very fresh. Most of the meat was very good though.<//Text>< gmap_id>

This place is hidden. Other then the lack of staff this place is not bad. The steak was the best part also, the Korean wine was not bad. Kept the bottle since I am ghetto. For the price and location of this place, quality of food. I give it four stars.< /Review>

<review>Im really surprised why this place is so quiet. There is a wide variety of meat and cooked Korean sides. The quality of meat is great and 16.99 per pax for a buffet dinner is really really a great deal! Definitely a hidden gem waiting to be discovered by more!</review>< Pictures>

<Review>Excellent place for all you can eat Korean Bbq. The meat was high quality, and for 21.99 on weekdays, you really can't beat the incredible price. I asked their cold food bar as well. Overall just an incredible cake for money located in monterey park.< /Review><Name>Lu Yang< /Name></record>

Went there as part of an Christmas Office party, where our group was distributed to several tables.  The place is clean, well-designed and brightly lit, upstairs in a somewhat shabby multi-use complex.  Tables typically seat 4 around a stainless grill at the center of the table, where you cook your own meat selections.

You order meats from a long menu -- including marinated beef, pork and chicken as well as unmarinated selections like steak, bacon ("pork bellies") and shrimp.  The staff will deliver up to three meat choices at a time to the table and you share.  Standard tableware are chopsticks and a single steel tong to be used in common to turn the meat.  There's a self-serve salad bar where you can also get some grillable accompaniments.

The grill surface is stainless steel and the staff will lift it off and replace it with a clean unit after your first round of meats.  There's a button on the table to summon a server when you are ready to order a second round of meats.  Theoretically, it is all you can eat, but two rounds was all we could manage.

This was my first experience with Korean BBQ and I think the newbie would want someone more experienced along for a first ride.  How satisfied you are is likely to vary with how successful you are in selecting meats and managing the cooking process and the traditional Korean condiments.  As simple as it is -- and there's nothing complicated about laying meat on the grill and turning it over when it appears to be done -- you will want some reassuring instruction from your companions.  The staff may be used to instructing newcomers -- I don't know because we had some experienced diners among us.  Service, as far as bringing meat and clearing the table, was efficient but not particular friendly or interactive -- that might not be case if you were not part of a large office party as i was.

The apparent quality of meat was very high.  I found the marinated beef especially tasty.  I am not sure I like sharing my table with a very hot grill, but that's necessary to the experience i suppose.  Other people i know said Honey Pig is as good as it gets in the Korean BBQ category.

Pricing seemed fair.  Standard gratuities are added to the bill.<//text>

Good service, great location, but so-so quality meat... Their grill doesn't really catch oildrips and it constantly gets burned and makes black smoke. I'd rather spend few more minutes and go to Ktown to get real meats.< /Review>

<Text>this would of been 4-5 star, but i can't eat here alone. let me re-phrase that, they don't allow a single person to eat for table of 1. i just wanted good lunch. you are required to come in with 2 or more people. i like the food and the meat selection and that fact that there is a KBBQ so close to home. why HONEY PIG!?! why can't i just grub on my own?!! WHY DO THIS TO ME? i'm hungry and too lazy to go to New Gen or RTS.< /Text>< pics>

As a Asian I don’t understand why she point out da tips. It is afraid that we won’t pay the tips or something ? Cause we go there often and we pay TIPS EVERY SINGLE TIME.We went to ask the waitress at the front door she said i point out Costumer tips every time. Which is so suck !

For the $17 price tag, I think you are getting a good value.  Big selection of marinated and unmarinated beef, pork , chicken, and seafood.  A pitcher of beer is only $10 with blue moon included.  Self serve salad bar.  This  will be a regular spot for me when I want kbbq and beer.<//Text>

The quality of the service was great but believe me man, this is not the place to come for Korean barbeque. The quality of the salad and select meats were great, but there fish cakes or crab cakes that were presented on the salad bar gave me food poisioning. If you really want an authentic Korean barbeque meal go to JBBQ on Vermont Ave in LA. That my friends is higher quality meat and same great service.</Text>

<Text>The atmosphere in the restaurant is perfect. Nice music and clean table wares. Service is average. BUT the star of any restaurant has to be the food which, at Honey Pig 2.0, is what I find very lacking in taste and quality. While the price tag seems pretty good for an average Korean barbecue restaurant, the quality is just not there.
First, let's start with the sides because that is what you will have to walk up and get it yourself in a buffet style which is fine. There are typical Korean sides such as kimchi, rice, mash potatoes, etc. what strikes me the most is the fried chicken which is stone cold. Kimchi tastes like it is bought from a store that comes in a plastic jar container.
Moving on to the meat which is very lacking in consistency. Brisket sometimes come with extreme amount of fat and no fat at all. Beef short ribs are very tough like rubber. Beef galbi came in a very strange condition. The beef itself is charred and seems like it has been partially cooked once before it was served.
Overall, the restaurant fails to highlight the most important thing, the food.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<Text>Went during lunch time on Friday. The service was prompt and attentive. Refills were prompt, food came out quickly, the dishes were nice and clean, the side dish bar was nice and well stocked.

Best part? The pork belly, the marinated pork belly was delicious and full of flavor, the kalbi was boneless and prebbq'd lightly so it wouldn't take forever to cook on the hot plate.

Also, unlike most KBBQ places, this place actually turns on the hood, so that the place isn't smoky and you don't end up smelling like KBBQ when you're done. This is how it's supposed to be done, the other KBBQ places could most definitely learn a thing or two from this place!<//Text>< Pictures>

No stars if possible. Food was not that great and the sides looked like they were left out all day. Plus some lady wanted the tip. Never coming back here again.<//review>

<rate>1<//rate><Text>(Translated by Google) Service attitude is quite bad. Going at night, the waiter saw that he was getting off work, and he couldn’t help but rush. . Go quickly, there is nothing left! I won’t go again.

Professional and courteous service. Responded quickly to my quote and complete the service faster than expected.

I had a duct with restricted airflow and an overflowing drain pan.

Told me exactly what was needed to inspect/repair and kept me posted throughout the entire process.  He also gave advise to maintain the system.

Would definitely return for future service.</Text>

This was my second time with Ultimate.
Eddy did the first check and visit. He was very nice.
Nevertheless, Ezer, the owner, finally repaired it. He was nice, quick and extremely knowledgeable, AS ALWAYS.
And also, last but not least, Jennifer, the lady over the phone who I never met in person, was AWESOME ! Super kind and warm, also very qualified and helpful.
VERY much recommended !!< /review>

Ultimate Air made sure I knew exactly when the appointment was via text, showed up on time, diagnosed the problem and was able to fix it in under 30 minutes. Thinking I had a major problem with my A/C, I could not of asked for a better scenario. On time, Fast, Friendly and inexpensive.<//Review>

Eddie knew immediately how to fix my air conditioner and he was so kind.  I greatly appreciate that he took the time to wear protective gear, (mask and gloves) and he was very patient with all my questions.  He fixed the issue and did a full service check.  I am grateful to Home Advisor for making Ultimate Air Conditioning Inc. the perfect choice for any future A/C needs. Also, Yadi, the receptionist was super helpful and friendly!<//Text>

I am thoroughly stratified by this transaction.  Mr. Ozeri and his staff are consummate professionals.  The project was completed in satisfactory time, and without a hitch.  The people at Ultimate Air went out of their way to accommodate my requirements, and were always pleasant, respectful, and maintained a professional manner throughout.   I am completely impressed, and highly recommend them.< /review>

Ultimate Air saved the day for my family.  We moved into a new home and a week in the HVAC dies.  We had another company in that we had previously dealt with and they would only talk to us about a complete replacement.  They took over 36 hours to get back to us with pricing.  The quote from that company was $13K!  We promptly called Ultimate Air which is now our first call always of course.  They came the next day and suggested various options of which was also replacement within moments of the end of house call.  In the end we decided to replace the system, because it was old and it made sense.  Ultimate's quote was way less and so reasonable.  They were quick to get back to us on all fronts and a pleasure to work with.  You can image July in the valley not being the time to wait on an HVAC install.  They came the day after I approved the estimate to eye ball where the crane would park, and they were back the following morning earlier than their 8 am call time.  They made everything painless, including having a crane come to put the unit on our townhouse roof!  I truly felt like they wanted to help, and would do anything to make it all happen as quickly as possible.  I cannot say enough good things about this company and everyone I dealt with.  They should be your first and last call.</text>

<text>Definitely will call any time I need a repair. These guys are transparent and honest, patient and thorough.

Our condo has some wonky issues, what would be a simple DIY install always ends up being an 8hr goose chase that requires professional attention.

Our AC setup was no different but these guys patiently helped solve the mystery with us over 3.5hrs. While understandably they could have left once things were up in running, instead they also took the time to make sure everything was in 100% working order.

(P.S. Also very respectful of Covid-19 safety)</text><gmap_id>0x80c29cc30c9ac133:0x5e13463218b5666d<//gmap_id>< Rate>

< Review>
I had a technician come out to replace my old mercury switch thermostat. After he got started he discovered that at some point one the the safety features of the unit had been tripped which meant the thermostat was not communicating to the actual unit. Once he tracked down the problem he fixed it and didn’t charge me any extra. I will definitely call them if I have any problems in the future.< /Review>

<time>1515006285097< /time><Rate>5</Rate><Review>My air conditioning unit  was acting up. Called a few other companies they could not get to the bottom of what was wrong.  They all suggested to buy a new unit. Keep in mind the unit is only 2 years old. Luckily i found Erez / Ultimate Air on Google. this was the only company to actually figure the problem out this saved me a lot of $$$. Very professional and knowledgable priced well. Highly recommended.<//Review>< Pictures>

Ultimate Air Conditioning and Erez are amazing! After numerous unprofessional or overpriced estimators from various companies we choose Ultimate Air Conditioning to revamp our heating and A/C work done improperly by another contractor in 2011. We were referred to Erez by an Engineer friend in December, 2017 who told us that Ultimate Air Condition had a very reputable reputation for honesty and hard work. Not the cheapest and certainly not the most expensive. Just Fair pricing for intelligent, well thought out hard work.

Erez promptly arrived for his estimate and gave us the confidence in his ability do do the job. He came up with better alternate designs which even the largest corporate estimators missed. Many HVAC companies have little interest in smaller jobs or use scare tactics to convince you they are your heroes. Erez and his crew arrived on time with email and text notifications detailing estimated arrival times. Even signing the digital contract to commence work was convenient.

Approximately a two and a half day job, Erez neatly installed the new duct work for more even distribution and came back to make any necessary adjustments as needed. Erez and crew are polite, very hard working and professional. He was also very helpful in finding a solution when it was discovered that copper piping was in the way of a new duct that needed to be installed. They always swept up and left the construction debris cleaned up at the end of each day. They truly went above and beyond.

I typically never pay for a job until completed, but in this case when a return air box being built offsite was delayed a couple of days due to the Holiday, I still paid in full once the main job was completed. That is the level of trust which I placed in Erez. There are many "hit and run" companies which overcharge or never come back when there are issues. We have renovated dozens of homes throughout the years and have nightmare stories with other installers. Erez and Ultimate Air always returned when stated to complete the job.

Whether zoning, or installing complete new systems, Ultimate Air Condition is the go-to company recommended by many Realtors and satisfied customers. With neat installation, fair pricing and professionalism, my wife and I absolutely recommend Ultimate Air Conditioning.<//Review>

They gave me an SUV with the tire light and maintenance required message on the dashboard. I brought this up to the attention of the staff who then took it to a gas station to put air on the tires, came back with it and the tire light was still on. At no point did they offer to give me another car.  Had the tire actually gone flat while I was driving I would not have known as the tire light was on throughout the entire week I had it. They stated that the maintenance was done a couple of days prior to me getting the car. I took pictures of the tire light a long with maintenance message and huge stains on the backseat (pictures) Furthermore, the staff forgot to add a period and charged my card $52,987 (see picture). Upon returning the car the only thing i was offered was to waive the $50 gas charge because it was at half a tank. The service was awful from the start and I am highly dissatisfied. I would not recommend this place to anyone and I would double check your charges immediately after paying.<//review>

I cannot say enough great things about this location! I have been yearning for a new car for the past few months and was finally in a good place to get one. I knew right away that I wanted to purchase through enterprise, as I've heard great things. Kevin Yaros was my salesman/contact and he was VERY helpful, friendly, and honest. 3 of the things I was looking for in a car salesman. No gimmicks, he answered all of my questions about the car and I felt good leaving the lot with my decision. I ended up getting the Nissan Rogue 2018 and I LOVE IT. Thank you again Kevin and Enterprise for your customer service.</Text>

<Review>I rented a full sized SUV for our wedding.  When we arrived at the Vista, CA Enterprise Rental location I ended up waiting between 30 and 40 minutes to pick up the already reserved vehicle.  Since we were in a rush at that point I drove the vehicle off of the lot even though the vehicle was extremely dirty inside and out with bird poop, scuff marks and a film of dirt all over the vehicle. The vehicle was not vacuumed and there was white, dried mild over the console.  Also noticed that the front left tire was practically bald, which caused concern when we were driving out in the rain that Sunday morning.  My wife and  were a bit disappointed with the rental and after paying $400 for the two day rental I am still in disbelief to say the least.  If there was another vehicle option that day I would have taken it but there wasn't. Very dissatisfied and I would not recommend that location.  When dropping off the vehicle that lady was not very customer service savvy which further rubbed the salt in the wound.  Not good at all.<//Review>< rating>

The car originally that was given to me smelled smokey so they gave me a different car. An easy change and done quickly. Everything was handled professionally, the only problem was because the rental was through my insurance they could not offer me Enterprise points. I always go to Enterprise for rentals, but because they have a hard time giving me points I may try elsewhere next time.<//Text>

Pre-ordered and paid for this vehicle 2-day prior to arrival.  Scheduled pickup time was 12:00 p.m.  Upon arrival I was advised that there were no cars available for the agreed upon price until 1:20 p.m., or I could pay more and get a car immediately.  I waited until 1:20 p.m. and received a vehicle that smelled so strongly of smoke, I needed to drive with the windows down.  As my schedule did not allow me to return the vehicle immediately, though I did end up returning the vehicle early.   I have been a long time customer of Enterprise and have had good service and quality of product in the past but this was my first rental at the Vista, California location and will be my last.< /Text>

<text>When you're renting a car, it's because you need it.

It's very frustrating and inconvenient when you choose your car type when making the reservation, then confirm said reservation with someone on the phone and they reconfirm the type of car you are PAYING for, and then you show up the next day at your scheduled time and there are no cards left...

I waited over an hour before I was even told what was going on. I actually learned about the situation through other conversations with people that had been waiting over 2 hours for their cars.

I do think the people working at this location are nice and tried to work with me as well as several others that also did not have a car reserved for them, but it just comes down to inconvenience.

I understand you cannot be promised an exact vehicle but when you're making a reservation for a small or mid-sized SUV and you are offered "the only car available" which was a giant 4 door pick up truck.... no thanks. Customers should be able to trust that they are booking with a reliable company.

I was renting my car for a job out in Palm Springs and I ended up just leaving and canceling the reservation on my way to another rental car place. It totally impacted my work and day in a negative way. I would just be aware of this when renting at this spot.

I am super bummed because other Enterprise locations have been pretty reliable, but this experience was so irritating I am worried about even renting from another location and having to go through the same thing. I really just dont get it how this seems to keep happening.</text>< Response>

I am giving one star because I have been to this branch four times in the past three months and on three of the visits, I saw workers not wearing masks. This includes workers in the office without masks and workers cleaning the inside of cars without masks. I mentioned this to the Assistant Manager during my last visit. I also emailed the branch to tell them.

As someone who has traveled to this area to take care of elderly relatives, it has been stressful knowing that the cars I have rented may not be safe. It has also added extra work for me to sanitize and then air out the cars for several days.

The employees at this branch are extremely friendly and provide efficient service. They are good at their jobs. I also got a great rate and the employees were always ready to help me work through some complications with my contract. Their service deserves 5 stars. However, all things considered, I don’t think I will rent here again.

Enterprise emailed me asking for a review, which is why I am posting this.<//Review>

My wife's vehicle was involved in an accident.(10/13/20) Once the responsible partys insurance accepted full responsibility we were referred to this location. When calling them to acquire a vehicle they had no vehicles for us to use. They then said that I couldn't get a vehicle that matched my vehicles size to meet my families requirements. We spoke with Mercury insurance whom was the responsible parties insurance and they approved for the larger vehicle daily rate. It took us roughly 3 days to get a vehicle that was big enough for our family. Upon pick up day I was then questioned about the approved daily rate. In which I provided the updated reference number. There seemed to be a few unsatisfied customers at the time I was there and I could tell employees began to lose patience. We got our vehicle back after repairs and then I received a phone call asking about the pricing. I told enterprise I would call them back.. then the rep I originally spoke with wasn't available and left a message requesting a call back. I never got a call back. Then I received a text regarding a customer service rating. I rated it with a 2, with the lowest being a 1. At this point I expected a call back at minimum for curiosity of the low rating. Then to check this morning that I had been charged for something I shouldn't have with no call back and I've been waiting on several attempts to reach the office. After 12 min the line hangs up. I tried 3 times.. At this point I would highly not recommend this location for any rental vehicle services.

Update:
11/13/20

Called to see if I could get a refund or reasoning why I was charged.  The associate I spoke to said I would be refunded and I would receive an updated receipt via email. Still a waiting on the email.

Update:
11/17/20
Received a phone call couldn't speak with the representative at the time. She said I would receive a call back later that day which never happened.

Still waiting on receipt email update regarding my refund and my refund as well.

Update:
11/18/20

Received a phone call with a sincere apology.  I also received my refund as promised when this representative told me I would receive it. All in all quite the challenge for things to be corrected but glad to finally have my refund.</Review>

<review>What a dumpster fire. I booked online after renting dozens of times. This is the last straw. Booked a reservation and scheduled my checkin for noon. Arrived at the location and was told that they have no cars. I explained that there were a bunch of options online and the guy said 'reservations doesn't communicate with us or know how many cars we have'. Everyone was just standing around inside. I asked why they weren't proactively calling people to let them know and he just gave me a shrug. Never renting from Enterprise again.< /review></record>

<Review>Awful place. To pay with a debit card you need a California license and proof of address matching the address on the license but they only accept paystubs, paid utility bills, or home insurance. They won't accept vehicle registration, mail from the county or government, no bank statements or checks, no pictures of your family INSIDE the house, nothing. So no, they don't specify clearly which sucks<//Review>< Pics>

Everything went very smooth. The attendant was professional and efficient in processing the rental. It was the day before Thanksgiving and the place was busy. Returned the car on time and left keys in drop box. The final bill was perfect.< /Text>

Spent half the day trying to report an accident claim. Customer service tells us to call Roadside. Roadside tells us to call local branch. Local branch tells us to call customer service. None of them want to open a claim.

Called this local office. First, an employee tells us that she cannot open a claim and refuses to let us speak to a supervisor. After a couple of call backs, we finally get a supervisor on the phone. The supervisor (Daniel)  puts me on hold and hangs up. We call back, supervisor spends 20 minutes trying to locate the vehicle in their system, tells us that the car was not even rented on the day of accident. After I tell him that it's listed on the police report, he says he was finally able to find it, and is going to start the claim process, places me on hold again, and after a few minutes, an employee picks up the line and tells us that the supervisor is now in a meeting and will not be able to help us. Absolutely ridiculous!< /text>

<user_id>106882757427298070574< /user_id><Review>DO NOT RENT FROM HERE!

I have had a horrible experience renting a car from this location and am extremely upset and disappointed. I have rented cars with other enterprise locations in the past and haven't had any issues, but this particular location has been a nightmare.

The last week of jan/2021 I rented a newer Ford Fusion. There was no issues with the car while I was driving it - it wasn't until after I returned the car I encountered problems with Enterprise. When I arrived at this location to rent the car, the person assisting me was trying to upsell me a vehicle that costed more than insurance would cover each day - I SPECIFICALLY said I DO NOT WANT any upsells, and only want to rent a car completely covered by insurance. She then pointed out 2 cars, one of them being the Ford Fusion, saying each one of them were completely covered and NOT extra. I agreed to the Ford and paid a $107 refundable deposit. I drove the car for about a week until it was due back on the 30th - which i returned ON TIME, in tact, and with 3/4 filled gas tank (as that is how full it was when I received it, and was to return it as such).

On the 28th, I called this location and asked a representative if I could drop the rental off at the property after hours, as they close at 5 or 6pm and I was scheduled to work until 8pm. They said I could "leave the keys in the dropbox" and that I would not be charged an extra day. Just to be sure, I called again the morning of the 30th (the day the car was due back) before my work shift to confirm I could drop off the rental after hours in the drop box without being charged an extra day. Again, the representative confirmed this to be true, and I felt relieved and confident I would receive my $107 deposit back in a few days.

Dropping the car off was a bit frustrating. It was dark and there were no signs or instructions where the dropbox was supposed to be. The front door was blocked off by a podium, so it was impossible to see that the dropbox was directly behind that. I looked around the corner of the building and saw "truck dropoff" and placed my keys in there. The next morning I called to confirm they received the keys - to which they replied, truck employees are not here today, but will be here tomorrow and only they have access to the box. But don't worry, we see the Fusion parked out front and see that you've returned it and you won't be charged. I thanked them and hoped it was over after that. I was wrong.

Sure enough several days later, I did not receive my refund. When I called the location to figure out what was going on, they tried to tell me that I dropped the car off on the 31st - the day after it was due back. They also informed me that apparently the Ford Fusion id been driving was an additional $4 per day! I explained that I returned the car on the 30th and put the keys in the dropbox, and insisted before renting the car I DID NOT WANT Q CAR THAT COSTS EXTRA!!! Either the representative that assisted me that was didn't know how to do her job correctly, or she completely and unethically verbally mislead me to believe the car was completely covered. I asked to speak with a manager, but the representative said they were busy and would call me back. I still haven't received a call back, or a solution.

Rent here at your own discretion - I would hate for other people to be ripped off the way I was!</Review>< pictures>

<text>I'm here now trying to pick up the mid-size car I reserved for after my wedding. They now tell me they have no mid-size cars available here or at any other nearby locations and are kindly offering me a truck or mini-van (why?) and the ability to pay significantly more on gas during this trip. Getting to this point has taken an hour.</text>< Date>

<text>My wife and I initially reserved a vehicle far away at the SD airport for our out of state vacation.  We live in coastal north SD county, so when we learned that Enterprise has a site in Vista, we canceled the SD reservation and reserved an SUV in Vista.  Danny was very helpful; gave us his undivided attention as we discerned which model would be best for our travels.  As it turned out, we drove off with a fine quality SUV.  Perfecto.  He was also there 9 days later to greet me and conclude the rental.  Excellent service, experience.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1605087160951, 'text': 'Hi Robert, we are very happy to have provided you with such a positive experience!

Worst rental car location I have ever been too. Rented a car for 1 day and was assured we could drop the car off after hours. Ended up being charged for 2 days, so I called the location to see what the issue was. I was told they would refund me for one of the days as I had the car for less than 24 hours. I was also told I would receive an email with a new invoice. A week went by and no refund, no email, so I called again. Was once again told I would be refunded and receive an email within the next 20 minutes. 4 hours later no email, no refund. Called AGAIN. This person tried to tell me that because I returned it after hours I technically had the car for 2 days which I clarified when I picked up the car that returning it after hours would have no effect on the charge. The person then tried to tell me that because it was over a month since I rented the car (which when I called the first time it was not) it had to be approved by the accounting team and would take at least 4 more days to go through.  Decided to go to corporate because this location is completely untrustworthy and obviously had no intention of giving me the refund. Would not recommend to anyone renting a car from here!

Also we had to wait 45 minutes outside to get the car because they did not have one ready for us when we arrived even though they told us to pick it up at the time we got there. When we finally did receive a car it had the check engine light on.</Text>

<Text>I rented a minivan for a trip from San Diego to Santa Cruz and soon discovered it had no backup camera. It was a 2019 vehicle, so by law, it must have been equipped with one as it is an important safety feature. Car rental companies can make extra money repairing body damage. This is speculation, but I hope Enterprise does not deactivate them on purpose.
Other than that, the car worked fine and the employees were courteous.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<review>I was overcharged by two weeks while this car sat in their parking lot. I returned the car during normal business hours and called the office to let them know that the car had been returned. I did not receive a receipt from the transaction. Fast forward to a month later, several charges appeared on my credit card statement. They never checked the car in, they had to review the cameras to confirm that the car was there, and they never called me back after stating that they would call me before they closed. I had to call everyday for a week to receive a refund from this office. I will never go back or recommend this location to anyone.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Time>

< review>
I rented a car from the Vista office of Enterprise while my car was being worked on. When I dropped my car off, Enterprise was supposed to pick my up. A half an hour later I have to call to get picked up, wait another 30 min for them to get there, then find out they have no cars available (this has been scheduled for days). I get driven to another town, to wait another hour for them to prep cars, I'm 3rd in line. It took 3 hours from when I was supposed to be picked up until I received my car. I am not impressed. Either the management in the Vista office is asleep, or its systemic to the company, I dont know. I will never rent from this office again.</review>

My husband and I got a rental vehicle about a month ago due to a car accident. We have received the worst customer service throughout this time. We had a lot of back and forth on issues with payment and provided them with updates. Needless to say, my husband received a call from Riley and left him a voicemail threatening to call the police on him and report the car as stolen. It seems like reps do not know what their processes are as there is so much back and forth and we get inconsistent information throughout the entire time we have had the rental. As I informed corporate, the last thing I need is for Enterprise reporting a stolen car (Tesla) on an African American male due to current climate. I don’t want no harm caused to my husband and want him coming home safe to me and my family. If the reps and Riley at this location would have read the notes we could have avoided all this ruckus. We are good citizens and Intend to keep on paying Enterprise for rental. Overall I do not recommend this location due to poor customer service, lack of follow through and for the inconsistent information being provided.</Review>

<text>Rented a car for the weekend. Had to take the car back yesterday because the breaks were squeaking, they gave me a replacement and I realized while out, the right break light was out. I left a few messages and an email so we could switch it out, no one returned messages so I called and was on hold till the call hung up and suggested I try and contact later. I called back and the same thing is happening, on hold and they close at 12. If I try to drive this car I could possibly  get pulled over and given a ticket. Very disappointing. This is the location on Vista Way in Vista.</text>< time>

I reserved a large full size SUV Tahoe or similar, for a family trip, I reserved it in Fallbrook. When the text reminder came in it said Vista then I got an email reminder that said Fallbrook, I was very confused so I called.  After being on hold for quite a while the guy at Enterprise said the Fallbrook office was closed so I asked why the website let me make a reservation at that location, obviously it was not his fault it was a corporate issue I'm sure due to covid, fine it's only 15 more minutes farther to Vista, I asked him if they would absolutely have the SUV I reserved he said yes. So I showed up to get the car since I did everything online so it would be a fast easy pickup...yeah right, there were 15 people there all waiting for cars they had reserved in advance, after about almost an hour I took a walk around the lot and realized  they didn't even have a full size SUV on the lot, so I asked the guy  working there what was going on. He said sometimes people return cars late and they let people overbook. I was about ready to explode when a premium SUV pulled in and he said I could have that one witch took another hour to get ready, and it wasn't as big as the one I reserved so we had to leave 2 bags home and drive with one between us in the front seat not very comfortable. Overall I felt sorry for the workers having to deal with that. I was disappointed and next time I need to rent I will not use Enterprise.< /Review>

Good prices and close to the house.  I have rented from here probably a dozen times over the last 5 years.  They loose a star because the cars aren't always very clean and the last couple have had maintenance lights when I picked them up.  I will keep renting from them, but have taken to cleaning the windows and dash gauges when picking up.< /Review>

It's because of Jules.  She'll go out of her way can get you a car loan.  Not because it's her job, but its simply because she really, really cares.  She actually does want to help.

They worked with me after GEICO didn't want to pay for my rental any longer, and kept me in the same car at the low rate I reserved for . They have great customer service and are very sympathetic, not to mention attentive to their clients right when you walk in. Me and my Fiance were very happy and satisfied customers.

<review>The only reason for it not being a zero star is the vehicle is good. When I received the car the lady made it seem like we had to get the basic coverage at minimum when you dont need to at all. Deception being apart of their practice for greed. On top of that we were informed we would have the car three days and turns out we are only allowed to have it less than 48 hours. How does 3 days equate to less than 48 hours?. Disgusting.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

This is the biggest 5 star rating I can give!...I want to give huge thanks to Bobby...This young man is not only super polite and efficient on the phone but his customer service is clearly outstanding...and I must say everyone   we came in contact at the Enterprise Car Rental in Vista , CA. location was excellent and they were super busy at the time we were there but handled it well...In addition, my stepson had left his wallet with all his ID and cash in his wallet...I called and of course Bobby answers the phone and guess what the wallet was returned to lost and found with everything in it!!! GREAT GREAT JOB to Bobby and Everyone at Enterprise Vista...they have integrity, honesty, super friendly and efficient,,,I simply cannot say enough..Thanks so much for making our rental a great experience.

Reserved a car online, showed up on time, and was told there were not any cars available. After willing to wait, they took our info but then we were told that they would not accept our debit card. Okay fine, we’ll get a car elsewhere however we just Ubered here thinking we would have a car to get back. The associate, who was nice and tried to be helpful, offered us a shuttle when available but looked at the woman beside him, who I assume was the manager, and she basically shut down that idea right away saying it would be hours until she could do that. Not happy at all and then had to order another $20 Uber back to our hotel all for nothing.</review>

The service at Enterprise was good and the car they rented me was easy & nice to drive. I was disappointed in the condition of the car when it was given to me. The windows were a mess with spots & swirls on the glass everywhere, the outside mirrors were so bad I could barely see in them. With what is charged to rent a car I think the car windows should be clean as well as the inside and outside.</text>

My experience with the vista location was the best out of all my rental experience I’ve had with enterprise, the hole team at that location is always ready to serve you and get you in and out quick with a car that you like there’s no hidden fees just straight honest employees working there, that’s what’s going to bring me back there and rent my cars when ever I need one . They all work like a team and they rock. I rented a car on 5/14 returned back on 5/15 so the team that was there on those days are who have customers return for more business. Thank you for the excellent work. I’ll be returning back for any rental needs. Keep up the hard work!!!<//text>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><text>DO NOT BUY A CAR FROM HERE ! THEY SELL YOU DAMAGED CARS . I bought a Nissan Murano from them and took a three year finance with the car. I bought the car at 27,000 miles and I was super excited about the purchased!! I genuinely loved the car! And of course they try to sell you warranties but with low mileage ! Now I am a driver for lyft and Uber so when I purchased the car I told them ahead of time that I needed a reliable vehicle because I would be driving a lot of miles. ( you would hope they do the right thing when your honest about what you need ) I I did everything I could to maintain my car I always change my oil and constantly took it to my mechanic to make sure the car ran well ! This is where they screwed me .. They sold me a car that the transmission fluid needed to be changed every 35000 miles , which I was not aware of and they did not disclose to me....I bought the car at 27000 so I been driving the car for a year and what do you think happened! Had I known that I had to change the fluid that quickly I would have gladly done it ! But of course now am stuck with a $ 5000 bill because the transmission burned out ! When I called them up and told them to help me they made me waste my time to come back to the dealership and attempt to make me do a trade but because they knew the transmission was damaged and they wouldn’t make any money off of me for a new trade , they basically told me it’s better you go fix it!  Honestly I recommend to look else where it might not be every car but the fact that they were unwilling to work with me knowing my income depended on a vehicle was really disappointing. They made no effort to even try to help me they just ask me to come in for an opportunity for them to make more money! Take your money somewhere that you know they would be will to help !<//text><resp>{'time': 1582966821519, 'text': 'Hi Heidi, I would like to know more about your experience so I can help.

Another week, another rental needed. Made the reservation weeks in advance. We have:

* 2 Vans
* 1 Large Truck
* 1 Tesla

Do you want the truck or the van? (I reserved a sedan bc driving a truck or van in a highly populated area is a PITA).

Never, ever, ever use this business. There’s other rental places close.

Sooooo....ya. I waited around for two hours for them to “pick me up”, got a ride to the place, then got tossed around for 40 minutes of “what about this car?” Which was a bunch of SUV type gas guzzling monstrosities. I kinda wanted to do something with my day instead of play “wait for Enterprise”. If my company booking software didn’t book here, I would have cut bait and left.

10:10 won’t book here again.</text>< Pictures>

I absolutely love the staff at this location. They are always professional and patient. I love that they offer to pick you up to get your rental and will drop you off if you need a ride once you're done. They always have reasonable prices and their service it top notch.

Had to get a rental due to my car being involved in a hit and run. Great customer service from the guy that picked me up from the shop and also the lady behind the corner.

Cons:
They ready don’t derail the cars in between users.
How is it that it takes them 5 seconds to take the deposit out of your account but 5+ days to return it🤔🤔<//Review>

Best Enterprise location, best car rental experience ever. Quick and efficient service getting us in and out , excellent customer service, minimal wait while the vehicle was finished being cleaned. This was by far the best price I have ever paid for a weekly rental and by far the best car rental experience I have ever had! Thank you very much! I will never rent from another agency again.<//Text>

<Text>Unprofessional place, had to file a complaint through corporate for either a lack of simple cleaning their cars after an extensive rental period or staff who steal what's left back and never turn things in. Their phone customer service is subpar at best, at times leaving you on hold for 15 minutes and forgetting you were on the line, very disappointed in this location and their Management, can't not recommend.< /Text><resp>{'time': 1593708902268, 'text': 'Hi Dario, we would like to look into this further but need some more information.

<Review>To be honest, I was a little disappointed. Enterprise prides itself on customer service. I wanted to schedule my car rental at 7 but the earliest option was 8. I figured that at least they could get me out quickly. This was not the case. I did not get out of there until 9.  It was not terrible but this did not meet my high expectations of Enterprise.</Review><user>116703614374908967773<//user></record></dataset><record>

We had an easy seamless purchasing experience.  Enterprise had what we wanted at the fair price.  They handled ALL of the paperwork.  We believe their stars are well deserved.  They have sold to several of our friends who are also most pleased.  We highly recommend the team in Vista CA.< /Text>

My car buying experience with Enterprise was as easy and helpful as it could get. Steven even went to El Cajon to get the color I wanted and then picked me up in Oceanside after I took a rental back.  Frank handled the paperwork and even that was made painless for me.  Thank you, Enterprise I'll be back and have already recommended you to a friend.</text>

Enterprise in this area has too many procedures and restrictions when it comes to renting a car.  That isn't this locations fault though, so all things considered, the staff was professional, and wonderful.  High quality individuals.  The truck was clean, and the process went smoothly.  My only complaint is that the company I work for issues me a debit card for all my expenses, and enterprise will only accept a credit card for a rental...  I ended up swiping my personal credit card, and got into some trouble with the boss.  I feel that this may push some customers away.< /Text>

<Text>I love Enterprise!!! The employees are always nice and so helpful. We rent cars in the Oceanside and San Diego area quite often when we are in town. Can't beat the weekend deal when they run it. Last time we got a free upgrade! All the cars are clean and run great. The paperwork is minimal and they get you on your way quickly. Most locations will pick you up for free and drop you off after you return car. We will never rent from anyone else.< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Terrible!! The guy behind the counter seemed like you didn't want to rent a car to me. He was busy but he didn't even ask me if I could hold on for a minute or I can get to you after I'm finished with these people. He was outside checking the car in and realizing I wasn't the first in line I asked him if I could reserve that car. He mumbled something as he was walking away and so I waited around and waited around. Finally I talked with him and he said he had hundreds of reservations. There were only a couple of people in line behind me and I said that I would like to rent it for tomorrow morning. He reiterated. I went to my car but before I left the yard I gave my name to him and my phone number and I said if you want to do business tomorrow call me. Red, as I'll call him, seem to be having a bad day period two days ago when I went in there and wanted to rent a car for Thursday or Friday he was real nice when no one was in line. Guy has a lot to learn about business</Text>

They never offered me insurance coverage and when I asked about it, I was told they would take it out of the $200 hold/deposit I was required to give. I declined the insurance since one rep told me it was "around $20" and the other said "around $22" both of which were double the other agencies which offered insurance for $9 and $11. The floor mats were wet which I didn't find until the next afternoon when the car smelled like a wet dog and my bags were soaked. When I made the reservation I used my personal email and their system asked if I wanted to use my work email, to which I responded NO and now I'm getting emails from Enterprise non-stop to my work email, along with the receipt and requests for a review. So they did what they wanted anyway. The only good thing about the experience was the gas refill when I returned the car.  I wasn't going to leave a review but since they continue to send emails to my work email I figured maybe people should know what a bad experience I had with them.<//text></record></dataset><record>

Had a need for a rental while I had my car in the shop. Your pick-up service is valued highly by many. My mechanic referred to the service and the convenience for customers needing to pick up a rental car. The service was good and the car ran well. No problem considering Enterprise when I need a car in the future!< /Text>

Great service. I reserved a full size car, but when I  got there, I  was upgraded to a SUV at no extra charge. Alrhough I  wasn't  sure of this car,  it turned out to be very comfortable and easy to drive.  I would highly recommend  Enterprise as a rental choice. I will use them in the future for my rental services.
Thank you Enterprise.</Review>

<review>I have never had a bad experience with Enterprise, they have the best customer service there is in car rental. I have been their customer for years and have always left with a happy face thanks to their awesome hospitality, they make you feel important and really want to satisfy your needs, and if you were not 100% happy with your rental for any reason whatsoever, they will definitely make it up to you. They are the BEST!!!<//review></record>

They were helpful but low on stock for what my insurance would pay. They did give me a larger car which I didn’t need. Biggest problem was when adding insurance & when they gave me the pricing there seemed to be a miss communication on price. When asked for the the car they were giving me, I was given $8 for basic but it seems it was basically $8 more for that car than for the smaller car. I’m expecting maybe $130 max & it was over $450 for the 24 days. They did take off 7 days worth but still twice was what I thought. So unhappy.</text>

< Review>
This is to Describe the CAR rental Office  not the truck side .
First of all  the guys at the truck side are sharp and very professional.
However  the the other side  is Lacking  professional salesman  & customer  service personal,  from recently promoted manager to rest of his staff.
I get it right  ( the way I was dressed ) not gangster or street  like but not clean . like a client who need it  a rental !!!.
If I had the commodity  of home I could have been dressed  in a way more pleasant for the people of the sales lobby and perhaps appear less Mexican.  Manager neglected  our reservation didn't respected the price reserved obviously.   and passed it to a couple of Caucasian  ladies with out having  even the curtesy of asking them if that's what they want it . He decided  it was a better ride than the one assigned previously to them. We were supposed to receive  our rental at 1pm finally left the lot 1:55 pm with a bitter  unpleasant  service by the actual  floor manager, who I asked to get the supervisor  and he said he was the only  manager . whatever
... . This unprofessional worker kept whispering about our appereance and how he didn't  want it to rent anything to us. As another worker entered  the lobby and noticed the lack of attention excused the time of waiting as a response on whispers by manager " they are borrowing  money look them they want to rent car and can't afford  it"
.. during the time I waited been in and out two more Latino customers were turned away and he  went the extra mile to get the vehicle  for another customer from a different race .
I personally  try to see both sides of the situation but this time I have to share the rental  experience.
Very poor customer service.
The car was rushed out the detail for ovious reasons  but still had a great appereance  for the given time .
Thanks to the people who said hello, how can I help you & to the detail guys . I have to say  enterprise  good rental place.  BUT THIS EXPERIENCE  I COULD DO WITHOUT< /Review>

<rate>5</rate><Review>I rent a car once a month from them. Ihave never had a bad experience with Enterprise, they have the best customer service there is in car rental. I have been their customer for years and have always left with a happy face thanks to their awesome hospitality, they make you feel important and really want to satisfy your needs, and if you were not 100% happy with your rental for any reason whatsoever, they will definitely make it up to you. They are the BEST!!!< /Review>< pictures>

<Text>I had a reservation to rent on Easter break and they ran into a problem with the lack of vehicles. It was tight but they came through and made a heroic effort at the last minute to get me my vehicle at end of the day which luckily did not effect my trip. Always use this company over any other company for the convenience to help you get where you need to be at a decent rate. If ever I have a different experience I will also post that. No such thing as complaceny in dealing with customers, especially when you ask for a public mention. No sugar coated words just keeping it real. Thank you to those who are on their game and have so far kept my interest in the exclusive use of Enterprise. Kudos!</Text>< username>

<review>Picked up car on a Monday morning, have had some problems with this office in past-this car had no floor mats and the base carpet on the driver side was worn through where people have placed their heel while manipulating the brake or gas pedal. Looks tacky, and at some point may become a safety hazard. Seats were also stained. Fortunately work cancelled my trip that same afternoon, so I returned the vehicle the next morning. Friendly staff, and the first time I've been to this location out of 20+ visits that I haven't had to wait 15-20 min.< /review><time>1555814136281< /time><response>{'time': 1556665987913, 'text': 'Mr. Emery, we would like to look into this further.

I reserved a 15 passenger van to take the family to the San Diego Zoo. 6 adults and 4 children.
Was told I could pick the van up Monday morning at 8. Got a phone call at 7:33 am that the van was not there. He said they located one on Pendleton and would have it there by 9. Got another call at 8:22 saying the van was on the way and was 15 minutes out. That would make it 8:35ish. Got there at 8:45 and 6 people ahead of me. At 8:55 was told van was not there yet but on the way. Completed paperwork, now 9:10, and was informed the van was dirty and would now take additional time to wash and detail the van. Cancelled agreement and left. BE AWARE!</review>< pictures>

I always use Enterprise for my auto rental needs. The pick up and drop off at one's home when in need of a local rental vehicle is so important!
Everyone was courteous, as usual, and the entire experience was pleasant.  The surplus deposit was returned to my account promptly. Thank you Enerprise, Vista, CA.< /Text>

<Review>It took them 2 hrs to pick me up at my home. I tried calling them but no one picks up the phone.
Then after arriving you have to wait for 30minutes and there is no system or a line. So you don't know who is next on line. After I got the car (new Chrysler 200), it malfunctioned  after 2 hrs of use. I called the customer service and they can't deliver a car to you. I have to pick another car at another office. It was really a bad experience and ruined my weekend. The only good thing is they credited back 1 day. But I think this is not enough for all the trouble.<//Review>< Pics>

<text>OMG this place is the best!!! That Chloe chick that works there is pretty rad. Some really ignorant lady was yelling at her when I went in and I was surprise she didn't pimp slap the lady in her mush mouth. Every time I stop by the whole team is absolutely on point I don't know how they deal with such annoying people all day every day I'm pretty sure Pope Francis is going to award sainthood to no less than half of the staff.< /text></record>

Rude and Run Credit Check?  You reserve a car at a great price/deal.  When you walk in they tell you the car you reserved is "Not Available" thus Force you to rent a car at a higher rate.</Review>

The worst customer service I can't believe they have 4 stars. I rented a car and reserved it a week before. I called to confirm my pick up on the phone and they told me to come pick up the car Saturday at 1 pm. I asked if I could pick it up earlier around 10:30 and they said no come at 1 pm. I show up at 1 pm and the sign says we close at 12. I talked to the employees on the sales side and they tell me, " oh that happens all the time"
So I got screwed, my trip got ruined because of their incompetence. Thanks enterprise.< /review>

< Review>
UPDATE!!! i emailed your care(less)@enterprise and a roboresponae said i had to use an email i sent a complaint from?! you guys are just a shiny beacon of quality all around!!! lol!
sad but true, with these stupid rains i HAVE to go back and rent a car...maybe things will be different this time...i doubt..im gon walk over instead of bothering with the ride that never gets there AND "for quality service, this rental will be recorded!"  so try!!

ok,leaving my old review so you guys can see....well, i try!

so, second time renting from them. i scheduled a pick up...never came! i eventually called and let the phone ring on speaker and someone answered. i was told they would get me in 20. about an hour later,i get my ride. so, at the rental office, i see it is beyond busy...why dont they have any more help desk people?! i dont know. i got told the car i wanted (or as energy efficient) is not available, but i get a free upgrade! ....THE DAMN CAR IS IN KILOMETERS!!!  mind you, i did graduate, but my insta-conversion is off. when i brought it up at return, i was told "it's rare that it happens" but...it had to happen to me?! no sorry no whatever. fine. the thing chugs gas more than im used to. sucked it up. i shouldve just waited for the one i wanted but i actually have things to do than just wait for the damn rental company.  upon return, i go again into a busy office and one worker. i won't give her crap but when im just returning and she filling in 2 more car apps, it does take the piss out of you. THEN, i finally get my keys tooken, she does the walkthrough without me (and does not check that the gas is over again, so no credit for gas..AGAIN!),  then im supposed to wait lord knows how long for a shuttle...i took the bus home! yeah, i decided on public transportation out of my pocket (again) than to get the enterprise pick up-drop off service i heard about. in finishing, im done! i found hertz is walking distance from them (as i was walking home) and have competetive rates! so, iunno if its corperate or that office, but i have been patient with them. sucks that i guess since i dont have a kid screaming at full lung, or a car insurance renter, or because i look like a punk mexican kid (im 34 mind you), you get the "luck of the draw" with customer service. again, patient...but two different visits and the same crap...

oh, cherry on the pie: i'm in the process of planning to buy a car. was gonna think about going through enterprise.  what you think im gonna do now?!

(first review)
well, besides being ignored in the "sales" area of the place and never told where i was, if i was being helped.. heck, i got eyeballed twice, but help?! no. when i finally snapped and asked one of the helpers..or car dealers..whatever they are, i was sent to the rental area. then,i was told i needed either a credit card or a debit card and proof of a bill with an address?! look, if i knew i needed all that, i wouldve been ready. THEN i get told there has to be the full amount on the card used. i finally was told i shouldve been called the day before and told all this...along with a courtesy ride offered...i got neither. i ubered it over. so, after about an hour of crap (and magically find proof of my credit card payments) i get my car! once you at that point, its all butter. check the scratches, shown the gas (mind you, it was at 3/4 and i filled it to full...never acknowledged when i got back...) and was on my way.  look, i get busy days. i get my mistake being in the wrong area, but customer service iiiis a bit lacking with certain people at this establishment. i know, they gave me a 20 dollar break on the deposit,but i think that was more a "just get this guy out of here already!" than a courtesy one. either way, im going to rent with them again because...they the only car rental place in town...yeah! monopoly! lol! i kid. na, i will give them a shot again because..they were not horrible...just glitchy. and some people wont be as nice as me, and decide to take their business elsewhere</Review>

If you want a great deal on a car - see these guys first.  I did my research and the service and price at Enterprise beat everything with no one else being close.  Even other rental car places like Hertz and Avis do not offer the deals available from Enterprise.  I have purchased two cars from Enterprise.  The first was a Kia that I had for 5 years then traded it in when I bought the latest car.  Our HOA has strict rules and I needed to park both cars in the garage and my Kia was too big.  I went to Enterprise online.  Selected a car in Long Beach.  They brought it down to Vista.  I test drove it and bought it.  The gave me a fair price on my Kia - deal done and home I go a happy car buyer.< /Review>

I forgot to call an hour before the appointment - it was confusing because I rent Enterprise in Philadelphia and don't recall doing that!!!  Anyway the pick-up driver was prompt and very, very nice.  The rental of the car was no problem until I got a "Bug" VW!! Yikes!  I have always disliked those cars but the bright red color was soooo cool.  The car handled oddly - I drive a 1975 Mercedes - LOL!  I got my 91 year old mother an I about for the four days.  Upon return there was no problem, however, the young landy forgot we were there for a ride home!  The same young man that picked us up returned us to our home and he is just a wonderful person and very personable - Mother and I are from Philly and his father is from New York so we had a lot in common!  Overall - very good service and we will use Enterprise one more time!!!!< /text>

<text>I’ve always had nothing but great service when picking up or dropping off a vehicle I rent. All vehicles are very well maintained, cleaned and gassed up ready to go! If anything happens with the car in which your unsafe or unhappy their response time to fix the situation is very quick. In being a company error they give you the option to pick another vehicle at your nearest Enterprise without a hassle. I highly recommended over any other rental company in North County San Diego area. Reasonable prices, great customer service and a variety of vehicles to choose from.</text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<Review>Good place for drink some beer or boost. They have really good hamburgers and also they have a billiard table ($50 cents per game) and knew they do some live music too. Nice place.</Review>< user_name>

I really enjoyed myself, there. It was very down to earth, mellow atmosphere. Very, friendly people. The kind of place i know i would frequent often. It was worth the distance. The karaoke was 👍 great. The kj was most handsome and talented. The bartender was charming.  A shame i didn't visit it much sooner, as i will be moving soon.< /Text>

I walked in and was warmly greeted by the owner and bartender for lunch and had an awesome hamburger with a side salad which was not iceberg lettuce but a delightful spring mix. I took home some chicken wings for my neighbors who raved about them. I will certainly be back to this fantastic rustic bar and grill!!</text>

<text>As an El Monte resident, I cannot believe I had not discovered this place before!

The service is adorable! It's family-oriented and has a very homely feeling. If you are a regular, the staff will recognize you and will converse with you about how you're doing, what you're up to, etc.

The food is great for an affordable price. It's a great deal deal here. Probably one of the best breakfast spots in El Monte.

If you're looking for a mom-and-pop joint in this area, I highly recommend this spot!<//text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO2NNLQwW8W9ST5rmUvlQ-sZh9l3dvfmNew56fQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNqsPPX9Rz0NRYsaxUcfKBo0-5P2Tk_CUyS1wDY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><userid>102726075962551189803</userid>< Rate>

This place is awesome. I love going here when I'm in Chino. Food quality is excellent and the servers are always nice. If you like large portions and country style breakfast then you should check this place out.< /Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>Anyway, we had a group of seven of us.  Our order was taken as quickly as it could be and the food came out quickly.  It was delicious.  Service was excellent and friendly.  The waffles are so yummy, light and crisp.  The Sour Dough French Toast was okay, a little overhyped.  Eating sour dough was not a good mix with the cinnamon sugar for me. Excellent</text>< pictures>

Love this place!! The atmosphere is very welcoming and I really like how they have a little bit of history on the walls!! (Pictures of El Monte dating back to the early 20th Century) All the employees are nice, attentive and easy going, the restrooms are always clean but most importantly the food is amazing and a great value!! The refried beans are delicious and the food is never over cooked. Will definitely keep coming back! (Try the green chilaquiles🤤😋)< /text>

A great place for breakfast and lunch. Their table salsa is better than what you'll get at most places. Friendly staff. I always get a fried jalapeño with my breakfast.  Worth checking out.</review>

Have been coming to Flo's for over 15 years and the breakfast is always great! I always order the breakfast burrito with nacho cheese and home made salsa on top. This time I opted for French toast which is also very good. Yoli the owner always makes us feel welcomed. The coffee is also delicious!</Review>

<text>So happy that Flo's Coffee Shop is open again! My mom and I came in today and enjoyed lunch on the patio. We shared the brisket breakfast burrito and chicken sliders from the Pop-up. Everyone was socially distanced, the food was perfect, and we felt 100% safe the whole time. So glad to enjoy the coffee/horchata again!<//text>< Pictures>

Flo’s was awesome when I was a kid . The original owner who ran it like 23 years ago did a better job . Now this place  is garbage.<//review>

I celebrated my birthday yesterday in this great restaurant. I am glad to say that we passed a incredible evening and the place was clearly one of the reasons for that outstanding meeting. The waiters  cooperated in a gorgeous manner, the cooking was great and my friends were extremely  delighted. We shall surely visit again for more celebrations. Thank you very much.<//review>

Flo's is morethan just a coffee shop. It's your mom and pop's diner that serve good breakfast and lunch. I was looking for a go0d diner and ended up here to grab breakfast. I had coffee, a pancake, veggie omelette cheese with potatoes and buttered wheat bread. Their coffee taste good. Similarly, their veggie omelette taste good and of good portion. Pancake and wheat bread were soft, tasty and fluffy. Moreover, their potatoes were fresh and tasty. Staff were amiable, attentive, and professional and competent. Indoor atmosphere was very welcoming and typical mom/pops kinda vibe. Indoor seats were huge. No outdoor seating. Prices are fair and competitive. Ample of parking space. Overall, I highly recommend Flo's and will come back again.< /review>

The environment walking in was very welcoming.   We took a seat up front and the coffee kept being poured... loved it.  The staff was super friendly, welcoming and inviting... our food took a bit but the whole time we were reminded that it was on it's way that it just was super busy... definitely loved it here and will be coming back.   Food was hands down delicious.</Text>

Was greeted and seated right away. Service was great, entire staff was friendly and it wasn't one waitor to a table, but more like 4 to all tables. Not to mention the food was delicious and brought out fast as well. My family and I definitely recommend it.< /Text>

Just recently moved to the area and I was in the mood for a mom and pop type of cafe. I googled and Flo's Coffee Shop popped up. I wasn't sure if it was the same owner as the one in Chino, but I thought I'd give it try.
I ordered the Country Breakfast, eggs over easy, hash browns, biscuits n gravy and a sausage patty, and of course, a cup of Joe.
Everything on my plate was absolutely delicious! The biscuits n gravy were soft, just the way I like them. I definitely recommend Flo's Coffee Shop. I will be coming back again and again.</text>

A friend had told me that this was a great place for breakfast, so I thought of it yesterday when Peck Road was closed going north because a dead body had been found. So I had to go south. I also looked it up and it was #3 of 176 restaurants in El Monte. When I got there I thought it was closed because all their blinds were shut. But the sign said OPEN, so I went in. It's not crazy cheap, it's reasonable. I ordered the enchiladas verde with 2 eggs. It comes with either rice and beans or potatoes and beans for $8.95. Delicious. I'll try lunch next time because some of the sandwiches looked quite good. Menu said they come with a side. Parked right in the front of the door.< /review>

One of our favorite places for chicken fried steak, refried beans and eggs.  Yolanda the owner plus many family members welcome you as though to  her own home.  The restaurant is decades in operating and serves many in the community for breakfast and lunch only from 6:30 am -2 pm.  The civil employees frequent Flos restaurant, especially police and fire personnel.  Prices are modest and pictures of historical nature of El Monte California enliven the walls.</review>

Found this restaurant just down the street form where I was staying for the night. Stopped in for what turned out to be a great breakfast and a great price! Most items on menu are only $7.95 or less! Wonderfully pleasant waitress. Great way to start your day!</Review>

<Text>I went to Flo’s because I wanted some breakfast type food from a non chain restaurant.  Since I was traveling alone I wanted to be around regular people. Locals maybe.  The food was good.  The cooks made great Mexican style egg dishes.  I think I ended up getting chilaquiles and it was everything I expected it to be.  There were a few locals inside.  The lights were dim and it felt like I was at someone’s house having breakfast before  I headed out for a vacation.  It was a nice way to start my day.  Nothing fancy just regular breakfast with regular people.  I’ll probably go back next time I am in the area.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

Decent atmosphere and AC. However, a downside is that the room is small and there could be a lot of people. I suggest the owner to take over the empty stores next to it to expand her business.< /Text>< Time>

Smaller menu, but what the lack in offering, they more than make up for in quality. I personally had the country breakfast, and was offered thier salsa. Very delicious and spicy, my favorite combo. Biscuits we're fluffy and gravy was rich and delicious. Hash browns are perfectly crispy and eggs were cooked to perfection. The service was prompt and always available, my coffee was never empty. Overall a perfect in and out breakfast experience.  Will be returning.</Review>< userid>

Service was quick.  The older waitress, the owner maybe, kept reminding 2 younger waitresses to be more efficient & attentive.  And this is one of few diners I've ever been to that offers tater tots!</Review>< pictures>

If you come to Flo's for breakfast your good, nothing to go crazy over. However when it comes to the salads they're just hideous. No effort or thought of making it pleasing to the eye. And forget the burgers(heres a tip) ask them to make you a burger using the ground beef they use for the hamburger patty w/eggs breakfast plate not the frozen discs.</text>

This will be the first place I think of when I want to have breakfast out. They did expand their dining area to the next door building so there is more room.

It was understaffed when we came in for breakfast for the first time and the waitress knew it.  She was an older lady but she was so nice and attentive when she could be and apologetic about the situation.  It happens, you know.

Anyway, we had a group of seven of us.  Our order was taken as quickly as it could be and the food came out quickly.  It was delicious.  Service was excellent and friendly.  The waffles are so yummy, light and crisp.  The Sour Dough French Toast was okay, a little overhyped.  Eating sour dough was not a good mix with the cinnamon sugar for me.

It seems Yelpers were very impressed with the coffee.  Even my group thought it was delicious.  It turned out to be nothing but a canister of Folgers Original.  LMAO!<//Review>

When we arrived we waited around 10 minutes. Inside is a cozy little place and it was actually full for a weekday morning (I think). Our waitress kept repeating our order with items we did not even mention/ order. When our food arrived to the table some items where a little on the overcooked/ burned side. The waitress seemed like she changed our order and when I asked she was super rude. Not to mention she didn't bring half the stuff I ordered and gave me something totally different. But it seems like she was doing it to other customers too (we overheard complaints). The food was ok, but a little to pricey for what we received. To make matters worse ugghhh the waitress was trying to charge me for items I never received and duplicates of same items! I came as a group, but once is enough for me :(<//Text>

Great hole in the wall breakfast joint. I would say skip Denny's or Ihop and grab some food that Isn't chucked out of the kitchen like some soulless factory. If you're around Saturday or Sunday their menudo is great. A small plate is just under $6 and it was enough and delicious. Next, try their country fried steak with a side of tater tots and a biscuit and gravy. I really don't care for biscuits but I love to dip my tater tots in the gravy and its gooood with 4 o's.  If your just in the mood for some traditional eggs, sausage, bacon, hash-brown, and pancakes then this place  won't let you down. Finally just wanted to add that its one of those places that has been there forever, or at least it seems like that. You'll see the walls covered in pictures of El Monte from the early 1900's. This all just adds to the experience. With great service and great food at the right price what more can you ask for.<//review>

<text>For my first appointment, I arrived to a very friendly and  pleasant front desk staff that got me checked in.   When I met with Doctor Mitchell, she was kind, and listened to my concerns ordered a panel of tests to assist in the diagnosis.  She informed me about the practices’ prescription program  offered to patients.   You can use your regular pharmacy but I found that  using theirs will save me thousands on my name brand prescription (generic doesn’t work for me).   Plus, the prescription service delivers for free and they kept their commitment to deliver it by 10 am. the next morning…. In fact,  delivered it two hours earlier.

I was signed up for My Chart, and the next day received a message from the doctor that all of my tests were  normal.  She invited me to come back if I have needs prior to my next scheduled appointment.

Great doctor, great practice.  As a newcomer  to CA, I am delighted to have found such a jewel of an office, and a smart, wonderful, and caring doctor.

The office is in Huntington Beach and I live in Irvine.  It took me twenty minutes to make a ten am appointment.<//text>< pics>

As a new patient, I was very impressed with the first visit.  Dr. Mitchell sat down by me and asked about myself.  She obviously was more interested in my health/background than the data on my chart.  I am glad to have her as my new doctor.<//Text>

I am a 67-year-old new patient for Dr. Mitchell, and I feel very blessed to have found someone who is not only interested in my medical issues, but has taken the time to get to know me. She is thorough, knowledgeable, and very personable. I highly recommend her to anyone looking for a caring primary care physician.< /Review>

Once called back the nurse was extremely friendly and helpful, even offering me water as I waited to see the doctor.  I came in due to complications with my asthma and the Dr immediately gave me a breathing treatment and shot to counteract my symptoms.  I felt better quickly.  Always a place you know you will receive good care!<//Review>< Pictures>

She does not  tell me what I want to hear but she doesn't push too hard on a certain course either, unless it's really important. Dr Mitchell has always worked with my unique, crazy hectic travel schedule and I couldn't be more grateful.

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>I have been seeing Dr. Nanette Mitchell for several years now.  She is very approachable and willing to share her knowledge beyond the purpose of the actual doctor visit.  I never feel like I am being rushed,  Dr. Mitchell gives me her full attention.  She listens to my concerns and  allows me the chance to try alternative avenues when I inquire. Thus, the highest rating.<//text>< Pics>

<Text>In spite of seeking help from specialists, Dr. Mitchell was able to remedy issues with a simple change of prescription and some soothing words. She takes time to explain and uses terminology I understand.< /Text>< user_id>

<review>Bernal Heights Park is an easy hike to mountain top and a great spot to see San Francisco skyline from the south. This is also a great park for dogs and dog lovers. Didn’t see any signs but most dogs are unleashed in the park. Gladly all the dogs are very friendly and cute! The official parking lot only has 3 spots, but street parking is easy even on weekend.< /review><Date>1622934912642< /Date>< user_name>

Brilliant place to see the city/landscape with a wonderful sunset backdrop to end the day.

Fairly easy climb which I think most people can manage.

85 and sunny gets you out doors and wanting to exercise! It’s a beautiful little spot in the city to take 360 degree views of almost the entire bay!</Review>

Uniquely beautiful views of the city's high rises that I would appreciate a lot more if more people understood the need for dog leashes. My dog isn't friendly like that, he is a guard dog and at 9 way too old to change that now (not that I even would change it), so my ability to enjoy the park is somewhat ruined by the constant barrage of dogs running at him and owners calling them back anemically as I hold the dog such that no biting can occur.

Also the rocks look like the land is rich in mercury and the 5G tower makes your teeth hurt if the wind is blowing the right direction but if like me, you aren't worried about that, then it's a beautiful park.<//Text>

<Review>Great hill to walk around and see phenomenal views of the city and surrounding areas. The path up to the top of the hill is wide enough for many people to walk at the same time and still keep a good distance.
Besides the amazing views, I was surprised to find a “Altar for Healing” at the top of the hill.  A beautiful piece of art that allows one to write a note to a loved one who has passed. Having experienced the loss of a family member this year, I was so moved by whomever created this platform. Thank you for bringing our community a place of peace during such a chaotic and grief-filled year.< /Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMp77MXvTSYpjanDVBtvcn4XRtLlYn6NoduS6A=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO77bDC-mgAe7ieveyIAxleXet6bGtia4Na760=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< response>

Paved and non-paved though well marked paths.  Fantastic views of SF and the bay.  There is also a meditative labrinyth to enjoy.< /text>

It was freaky going up since I'm afraid of heights, but man was it beautiful half way at the top! I cannot wait to go back! Definitely considering the big move.</text>

Beautiful place with incredible views, short hiking trails, and a lovely rope swing at the top. You're able to see pretty much a 360 view of San Francisco/the Bay Area, and it's truly beautiful. Definitely a must-see when you're up in SF, whether you're a tourist or a local. Great for walking pets too!<//Text>

Great views of the city. The paved road to the top is closed to vehicles and the walk is a fairly easy incline. Worth the walk.</review>

Maybe one of the best places to enjoy sunshine in this city. Great place for dog walkers. A little steep, so it's not very accessible, but you can drive at least part of the way up if walking is not an option.</text></record>

<Text>A gem to watch the city and sunset. Came up here with my friend to take sunset photos and I gotta say the vantage point is amazing. Getting to see the city skyline and also the bay and Golden Gate Bridge is pretty awesome! Behind the hill, you can see the fog roll in when the sun sets. Oh and the Sutro Tower is visible on the west side. Simply nice. Bundle up though, it does get cold.< /Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP0wmiCSlKHoOYethhtkw9nz_3uscNtcKM2wWcC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< resp>

Great park and usually plenty of space to exercise. Don’t take any of the small paths and stay on the larger paths. Great views at the summit or just on the lower path.< /review>

<text>2 stars for nice view and wide open spaces.

Lost stars for dog walkers who don't have their dogs on voice control and take up the entire trail. Be prepared to fend off dogs/dog fights. City regulates 8 dogs per walker - many of them have more than 8 and upwards to 15 or more.< /text><GmapID>0x808f7e5a8d77c955:0x6005f1a5fe870695</GmapID><UserId.>105473176316387886289<//UserId.>< user_name>

Went for an early-morning walk on a foggy morning. Was very peaceful up there, watching the city wake up and gradually get busier and busier. Had the swing all to myself as well :) On the way back down Google Maps recommended some adventurous route through over-grown lanes. Loved it, but was not expecting the steep muddy slopes :)<//text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>I visited this park because it was walking distance to my AirBnB.  This was perhaps the best view of the city at sunset.  There were lots of people walking their dogs and the climb up is easy, unless you prefer the more challenging trails.  The swing at sunset is truly a magnificent experience.<//Text>< pics>

Such an amazing park for grand views of the city. Some of the trail can get pretty rocky with sheer drop offs but just take the high ones. This park is beautiful for watching the fog roll over the city in the evening or looking at spring flowers in the morning. Really anytime is the right time here. Also you can take your time or make it a quick trip. Five dog tails up!<//Review>

This is a great vista on the city, East Bay, western corridor out to the ocean through the Excelsior. Bernal Heights is one of the last areas in the city to be paved over. There are still little dirt road areas in general it has the real neighborhood feel to it. You can walk from Bernal Heights Park down to Cortland Street to enjoy the businesses there. All in all, good exercise and cool part of San Francisco.</Review>

Great spot to catch sunrise and sunset. Great spot to walk your dog. Great spot to come for a picnic. Great spot to read a book. Great spot to watch the cityscape as the sun changes direction through the day. Great spot to swing on the beautiful swing here as you enjoy the view of San Francisco and the bay. Great spot to just do nothing. Must visit to get a view of San Francisco minus the interruptions. No ticket is needed. Just walk up the pathways. Do wear your sturdy shoes as the paths can be muddy in rainy weather.<//Text>

<review>Top view point of San Francisco!!!
Go and have a run. Bring your dog there if you’ve got one. You might both find new friends. Always some dog crews walked by their sitter/trainer.
Di you want to feel like a kid? Go on the top and grab the swing!!
There’s a 360 degrees authentic view with a unforgettable panorama that intrigues at weather changes. Love at first sight!
Perfect for all purpose, especially for a romantic kiss.< /review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPiP67UA9yWMGaDz7zQem1BkiE7KurXXXcVZPKV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNWIaQf5Ds8DhZ7MTtJs_m2AGzQ495HfNF-ljFG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN1h8lkPTCkS-vnj1K63Ec9le64paKf29Kl5Bgs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPneCwSMSRjDZwsdg0gG3vMgiH757IicHG2Z-1Z=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< Response>

I've lived in the San Francisco Bay area for more than 25 years, and this was my first visit to Bernal Heights Park. San Francisco never ceases to amaze with its high heels and shocking views.

Read up on the geology of Bernal Hill. There are tons of interesting Internet resources. Read about how the chert protects Bernal Heights from earthquakes.

One of the things I love most about Bernal Heights Park and Bernal Hill is the 360-degree amazing view.< /review>< Date>

I might just like Bernal better, but the drive up to Peaks is definitely more fun and windy. There's a really fun swing (one wooden and one tire)  at the top.

Nice jagged rocks make for some epic photo compositions. My friend and I didn't nearly explore everything, but we walked a circle around the main hill and really got to enjoy a panorama of the city. It was really refreshing to be so far removed from the hustle and bustle of San Francisco below.

Parking is really easy to find here. Highly recommended... Great hikes and a view to boot.< /review>< pictures>

Nice park to see San Francisco city skyline. The parking was easy on weekdays and you have a lot of options in terms of walking / hiking.< /Review>

Best point for tourists (not for locals) for you have a city view from San Francisco. I lived one of the best moments of my life here with a group of friends and my ex-girlfriend. Missing a lot those good times!!!<//Text>

Best off leash dog park and city view: day or night. With easy parking!

I have been living in Bernal Heights for 5 years and I am yet to get bored of this place. I almost get goose bumps every time I come with my husky.

✨You will:
- meet nice people
- meet nice dogs
- enjoy easy parking and stunning city views (360degrees)
- make your dog off-leash happy. Good recall is a must
- get inspired by local runners
- catch a swing ride (swing is down sometimes)
- might sight a coyote. Do not feed. Wild things need to stay wild
- take the best pics with the city scape
- make your out of town guest impressed and happy<//Review>

<text>Providing a 1-mile loop trail filled with scenic views, the Bernal Heights Park Trail accommodates walkers, joggers and runners of all skill levels. Accessible year-round, this is a pathway often used by dog owners.
The sweeping views of San Francisco come courtesy to Bernal Heights Park’s hillside terrain. With thriving grassland features, an abundance of wildlife, and plenty of walking trails to explore, it’s hard to believe that Bernal Heights Park was once just your average rock quarry.< /text><resp>None<//resp><time>1531118378659<//time>< Pics>

A great park. It offers great views of the city, especially the Mission. The park is also very large and has more than one peak, with a few trails that go through the grassy areas. The main peak has a large radio tower on it, and offers some of the best views. There is also a swing there, which is surprisingly sturdy and is fun to use.

Just be mindful of the weather, as it can be extremely windy. I've also seen coyotes here before, even on crowded days.</Text>

Day or night, dog or no dog, Bernal Heights Park is a great little city park where you can do as much or as little as you like. It is definitely worth a hike to the top for the 360° views and photo ops. Please be mindful that coyotes live here, so keep an eye put for them, especially at dawn/dusk/night and if your pup has come along. Enjoy!< /text>

Great views of The City that rival that of Twin Peaks. I might just like Bernal better, but the drive up to Peaks is definitely more fun and windy. There's a really fun swing (one wooden and one tire)  at the top.

Nice jagged rocks make for some epic photo compositions. My friend and I didn't nearly explore everything, but we walked a circle around the main hill and really got to enjoy a panorama of the city. It was really refreshing to be so far removed from the hustle and bustle of San Francisco below.

Parking is really easy to find here. Highly recommended... Great hikes and a view to boot.<//Review>

It's incredible. I wish the city would do something with making the trails safer to go up the hill, very slippery. Not welcoming to tourists who do not have sports shoes on them.</Text>

<text>AMAZING hidden gem. Yes it’s away from the sights and downtown but so worth it. You get 360 views and see the entire city, including the Golden Gate Bridge. There’s a fun swing and trails to see all over the city.</text>< Pictures>

Excellent views of SF Financial District's and Rincon District's skyline. This place is good for jogging and walking; some parts are still under construction, thus consider hard snickers</Text>

It's incredible. I wish the city would do something with making the trails safer to go up the hill, very slippery. Not welcoming to tourists who do not have sports shoes on them.< /text>

San Francisco looks good from many angles but the mix of nature and city makes this place particularly beautiful. It offers lesser known but just as stunning views of San Francisco that are comparable to Twin Peaks and Hawk Hill.< /text>

We just happened to be staying nearby, and our breakfast waiter recommended seeing this park. I know lots of people will say there is a great view, but that is super under-selling it. I refuse to post a picture, because it won't do the view justice. The park is also small enough that it isn't a hike to get around it. Lots of friendly dogs playing fetch and whatnot, as well. Great spot to go in the morning after breakfast.< /Review>

Best views of the city and bay area (good during the day and at night), nice walking trails on top, nice road for running a loop around (1 mile loop), and lots of parking if you don't fancy the hike up.<//review>

Well worth the hike with stunning views of the city. My recommendation is to bring a bottle of wine and some snacks while just taking your time to enjoy the view!</review>

A perfect, well-kept little neighborhood park. Great views. Rest rooms. Playground. I nice tables. Stately trees. Streets lead up to it from all sides. Quiet..path around the perimeter. Found it through "Stairway Walks in San Francisco", a great book.<//Text>

It’s probably windier than you’d like. It’s probably a bit busier, louder, and less green than you’d like as well. But, the view is killer and it’s actually pretty close to a bunch of other interesting stuff too. Hang out for a bit, then go explore around Bernal later. It’ll be a good day.</review>

I’m lucky I’m a neighborhood resident here and get to go up to this park any old time. This hill is steep but the views from the top are pretty incredible. It’s very rustic - trails are not super maintained, and there aren’t any amenities whatsoever. But it’s a community gathering place, wondrous lookout point, and excellent place to feel excited, recharged, and pensive. Bernal has a bit of an understated wild streak, and this hill is a core piece of the neighborhood culture.</review>

It's a cool place if it doesn't get too crowded. No public restroom available. Not much trees or shade available. 2 stairs for access. Small parking lot. Almost a 360° view of the city.</Review>

Fantastic view 360 at the top of park even on a cool misty January. Fun swing overlooking SE. Kid tip: with young kids walk along the road to the top. We had a few slips and heart stopping tumbles climbing up the steep trails with our 3 and 4 year old.</Review>

It’s wonderful park looking out the entire San Francisco Bay. There are trails to go to the top of Bernal Heights Park. You can enjoy the view of the city from different point of view. It’s dogs and family friendly park.</review>

< Review>
One of my favorite places to go for a walk either by myself, with friends, with a romantic engagement, or with my best friend CK - my dog. 🐕

This really is one of the less known gems and one of the seven main hills of San Francisco.

Quick guide:
Drivable up to almost the top. 2 small parking areas. Disabled parking available.
NO public restroom.
Great for walks.
Paved road with a few benches.
Trails for hiking.
Great views.
Dog friendly - expect lots of dogs.
Water fountain dog and human closer to the top
Tree swing on top
Alex Nieto memorial.
Total time to walk up and down from the bottom parking lot - around a half hour.
Suitable for good 2 hours of relaxed hillside hiking or quality time with your dog.

Verbose description

There is hardly any vegetation and very few large trees so your view is mostly unobstructed, on a clear day that is. The summit area is fenced off and houses some sort of a smaller radio tower but the area all around the fence is walkable. The public can enjoy the summit, the tower doesn't hog all of it.

There are many ways to access this park but the main way is a paved road at the end of Folsom Street. Follow it past Cesar Chavez a few blocks and it winds up the hill. The first stop you come to is a small parking lot of 4 spots and 1 disabled spot. From there, a closed for driving paved road goes into the park and the other road keeps going up the side of the hill and around it. You can drive further up and there is more parking, mostly street parking. One disabled parking spot is available on the top also. Lots of parking along the road. Access to the other side of the hill, Bernal Heights neighborhood, Bayshore, etc.

The paved road that is closed to cars leads up to the top parking lot also and continues up almost to the summit. To get to the very top you will have to hike up a little bit of gravel or dirt trails. There are plenty of trails available on the side of the hill and a large open space on the South Eastern slope.

This area is most frequented by dogs, dog walkers, dog owners, and people exercising. Be prepared to see many dogs of different kinds doing all sorts of doggy stuff. Another common sight is patents with young children.

There is also an open space at the level of top parking area. It features an impressive maze laid out of large stones, similar to the ones you may find at Land's End, MacLaren Park, and other Bay Area landmarks. There is a drinking fountain for humans and for dogs here. This area also has plenty of trash receptacles filled mainly with hundreds of pounds of bagged up dog poop. A great place to have a picnic. 😂

There are a few benches along the way so it is possible to sit down civilly, rest and enjoy the view.

There is a swing in the tree on the very top. If you aren't afraid of heights you can enjoy the view South and East of the hill while swinging pretty wide and high off the ground.

Mission is known as the sunniest part of town so it isn't rare to come up here and have open clear views of the city. However, it can get very windy so be mindful of that.

About half way up the paved road there is a community made and upkept memorial for Alex Nieto, a local resident who fell victim of police brutality. He was shot and killed by an SFPD officer on duty.

Please help keep this space clean and have fun!< /Review>

Our dog goes nuts here! Never too crowded, mostly warm neighborhood folk getting their workout, walking their pets or just coming out and enjoying the panoramic view of SF. Twin towers in the west, bay to the east, beautiful skyline to the north and McLaren park and SF Neighborhood views to the south.. it’s just so beautiful. Oh, while you’re at it, enjoy the swing hanging by the top most tree on the hill!</Text>

Great hidden spot in south San Francisco area. We went on weekdays so it was easy to find parking. The best thing on this park apart from view is swing on the top of the hill. Great Instagram photo location 😉< /Review>

Great place to see the whole of San Francisco... Even the Golden Gate bridge is visible if it's a clear day. There's a swing that you can sit and swing on while looking over the bay. The hike is a bit steep in certain parts but it's something the average person should be able to do. Definitely visit Bernal Heights to get an exceptional view and great photos</Review>

Awesome park! Off leash animals welcome but only if they don’t stray too far because it’s not fenced in. There’s a great drinking fountain with water bottle filler and dog bowl.<//review>

A neighborhood park approximately in the center of the Bernal Height.  There's a antenna at one end.   Some great views but it seems to be mostly for dogs walking.< /text>

Amazing place. My bf took me here, but it was feezing. Be ready to take a jacket and a cup of hot tea and a blanket haha. We got there before sunset so we can see the city. There was fog so we couldn't see much. Keep it clean and dont throw garbage so that it is an enjoyable view  and to be able to sit and chill . 😉😉☺<//Text>

Went to check out the swing, but must have been taken down due to covid.
Great views of the SF skyline!</review>

I was taken here by friends, and had no idea what it was. I climbed a trail I thought I would die on, and wondered if it could possibly be worth the effort.

At the top, I found a complete panoramic view of San Francisco that was absolutely awe inspiring. Remember that scene in Mr Roger's Neighborhood where they would go to the land of make believe, and you'd see this lovely little fake town? The view is like that, except its real. Like a real life tilt-shift image of the city.

The crowd was small, and I never felt crowded. The only thing I'd recommend is to be in ok shape, and wear good shoes. The slopes are steep, and the ground feels loose. Many good experiences in life have a feeling like you could possibly die if you trip, and this is one of them.</text>

Great views and fresh air. Midday is usually perfect to catch the perfect views but you can't lose with this spot. Usually you'll catch dogs on the trail. Lots of parking around the incline but can get crowded on a nice day.</Text>

This is one of my favorite parks with a half dozen little trails with some steepness. If you want a longer hike, you can easily do loops here.</text>

Great views here! You can see from downtown to Daly City here. Going on the swings at the top gave me the feeling of being up high.<//Review>

Biggest drawback these days is the foxtails!!!!  Be sure to check your dog's fur, tail and feet and pads for foxtails (various grass's seeds).  Then there are the coyotes hunting for food to feed their young.  Beautiful, so please be kind to our park!!!!!!<//Text>

Great place to sit and look at the city. The views aren't as great as Bernal Park but you still get a nice view and it isn't as busy. It's also a great place to hang out with the neighborhood dogs if you're into that sort of thing.</review>

This is one of my favorite parks with a half dozen little trails with some steepness. If you want a longer hike, you can easily do loops here.</Text>

Great views of downtown San Francisco & the bay. Very easy hike from park entrance to summit via mostly paved road. Strollers & wheelchairs can approach the summit & reach a fantastic view of downtown. But access to the highest point is via a short but steep foot trail. No bathroom facilities.<//Review>

This place is very similar to twin peaks but with less tourists. The view from the top is 360 degree. Unlike the crowd and blocked views in twin peaks. If you wanna enjoy the view without seeing the crowd and enjoy some time, go here.<//Review>

Not a ton of parking. Great views. I like to walk around and try to make out visible places I've been. There is a swing which is very cool. Seems like a popular place to run or walk for exercise.< /Review>

<review>Absolutely loved this park! Took my little on a Wednesday morning and it was empty, which is the best when you have too energetic of kids! The parking was taken over by a filming crew but there is always street parking, the park is very clean and it does a great job of making you feel away from the city without being away away!</review>< gmap_id>

One of the very best places to take your dog off leash in the city. Just be careful of foxtails during the spring and summer months! There's even a drinking fountain for thirsty humans and pups.< /text>

Its always a pleasure going to this park, it's quiet, and never too crowded, also I've been pretty lucky and always seem to find parking near or at the park. Plus if you get hungry there's good food a few steps away. Good place to bring to go food and have an impromptu picnic. Enjoy it!<//review>

Wonderful views of down town and both bridges from one side and a view of the bay from the other. A quick walk up the hill from any side is well worth it. A nice swing near the top and parking on the north and south sides.< /review>

Beautiful. Not much effort involved getting there hence you might want to extend your hike from mission and probably cover other places like the slide park. However, a must visit place for visitors to SF</text>

Easy hike with a great view of the city. Dogs are mostly off leash so if you don’t like dogs running around you, I wont recommend this.

The instagrammable swing is also not there already as of writing.</review>

Absolutely wonderful!! Large park with 2 different play grounds one for smaller children one for older children. There's a basket ball court. Bathrooms are clean..a place to BBQ and have birthday parties. Taking a brisk walk under all the trees and pushing a stroller is definitely lovely.< /Text>

<review>It's a nice steep hill with big views of the city all around.  You can see Twin Peaks, Buena Vista Park, San Bruno Mountain, Hunter's Point Shipyard, Financial District, etc really well from the top.

Very popular spot for people to walk their dogs.  There is a paved road that circles around to the top, but there are also dirt trails all over the hillside.

There used to be a swing hanging from the tree at the top, but last time I was there, it had been removed.  I was sad to see this, because you could get really high and it was really exhilarating to swing way out above everything like that.

Also, I have seen a coyote there several times, which apparently frequents the area.</review>< time>

<review>Great off leash dog park for dogs that don't need fences. Small parking lots on either side. A mixed use park as well so some people come without dogs to exercise. Has a water fountain on the south side. There is no playground equipment for children. And has a resident coyote so watch the smalls around you.< /review><Gmap_id>0x808f7e5a8d77c955:0x6005f1a5fe870695</Gmap_id><pics>None<//pics>< rate>

I'm here at least 3-4 times a week for a wonderful off-leash dog walk to the top. It's always full of friendly people and well behaved dogs. Watching the seasonal paintings on the Bernal rock change is always fun for me. My only caution is that a coyote lives here that can be seen at any time throughout the day. So it's best not to let your dog stray too far.</Text>

<Review>I've always loved coming and walking my dog here. I've been visiting this place since I was a little girl. And now I bring my little 4 y/o daughter Everytime I come here and she loves it too 😄 we always go to the very top and she goes on the swing they have up there and she always points out our house to me. I highly recommend this place to walk your dogs or even just to sit n relax n enjoy the view!</Review>< pics>

I grew up playing on the hill.  Great place for all.  Dogs run off leash, kids explore, adults enjoy the view.  You can take a short walk down to Cortland for food and coffee. Frequently very windy.< /Review>

Beautiful. Not much effort involved getting there hence you might want to extend your hike from mission and probably cover other places like the slide park. However, a must visit place for visitors to SF</text>

Wonderful views of down town and both bridges from one side and a view of the bay from the other. A quick walk up the hill from any side is well worth it. A nice swing near the top and parking on the north and south sides.<//Text>

<review>Great off leash dog park for dogs that don't need fences. Small parking lots on either side. A mixed use park as well so some people come without dogs to exercise. Has a water fountain on the south side. There is no playground equipment for children. And has a resident coyote so watch the smalls around you.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<Text>I'm here at least 3-4 times a week for a wonderful off-leash dog walk to the top. It's always full of friendly people and well behaved dogs. Watching the seasonal paintings on the Bernal rock change is always fun for me. My only caution is that a coyote lives here that can be seen at any time throughout the day. So it's best not to let your dog stray too far.<//Text>< Pics>

I grew up playing on the hill.  Great place for all.  Dogs run off leash, kids explore, adults enjoy the view.  You can take a short walk down to Cortland for food and coffee. Frequently very windy.<//review>

Nice little park in San Francisco with a good little hike up the hill. Lots of folks walk their dogs off-leash here. It's a nice place to come and enjoy beautiful views of all of San Francisco. I love this little hike and nice climb for exercise. 😊</Text>

All it takes is a super leisurely hike for one of the most beautiful views in the city.  And by super leisurely, I mean I've walked up the hill in heels before.  It's also a good place to walk your dog.  Every time I'm here, I wish I had a dog to borrow!< /text>

Beautiful park with 360 views all around! Best to visit after the area gets some rain, otherwise the grass tends to turn yellow quickly. Never too crowded and a great place to have a little picnic.< /Review>

Love this park. I have been coming since my childhood. Great for walk a run and even to swing for a bit. Great view of the city as well.</Text>

Fantastic view, challenging climbs, and a great overall ambiance.  It manages to have a wild and private feel, though not very large, or rarely empty.  Great walks, too, in the surrounding neighborhood.</Review>

For pets?  Its a pretty good spot.  But watch out for the foxtails and other thistles.  My GoldenDoodle came back with over 30 foxtails in his hair.  And he was on a leash on the trials.
Parking is horrible out there on nice weekends.  Midweek is decent.
There is also a really cool attraction at the top of the trail.  You have to go there to see it.  I wont ruin the surprise.< /Text>< Pics>

<text>The best-kept secret of Echo Park by far, this park is amazing, the grass is super green despite the drought, and the views are amazing, I would have to say the one downside about this place would just be the small parking lots, but it's a small park, so it really isn't a surprise or anything.<//text>< user>

Stunning views in every direction. Getting to the top can wind people who don't walk a lot or exercise, but the walk around the top is easy and beautiful. Great for dogs. Bring a date and a bottle of wine to the top and watch the sunset over twin peaks.</text>

A great place to walk or jog. I feel its primarily dog walkers so be careful where you step. I tend to take a portable disc golf basket up the hill and practice putting with a nice view in the mornings. There is also a hidden gem where you slide down near a set of steps. Bring some wax paper if you want to go really fast...< /Text>

<Review>My friend took me here as a surprise before I left SF at the end of summer.  The view was AMAZING.  I definitely recommend coming here if you like to sightsee, or dog-watch. It's pretty windy though so your hairs gonna get messed up if you're not careful.< /Review>< pictures>

One of my favorite places to walk up to the top of the hill and get a good look at the city. It is a pretty gradual elevation change. There are usually tons of dogs to pet while walking up to the top too.</Text>

Giant hill in the city. Nice place to just sit and chill, and great views of the city. Much quieter than twin peaks. Also nice to come at night time too.<//review>

There is a common theme that I like parks. This park is so so pretty. The view is fantastic, and you get such a nice view of the city. Next time I go, I need to try the swing.< /text>

What an amazing view of the city and surrounding neighborhoods. In all the years that I've come to visit San Francisco, I have yet to visit this look out point. On a clear day, you can see as far as the Bay bridge and Golden Gate Bridges. You can see the skyline of downtown and parts of the East Bay.

There's an access road to the top (there's a swing up there) and a dirt trail that wraps around the other side of the hill. Take both for a view from all sides of the park. Dogs off leash everywhere! And an adjacent hill with trails and blooming yellow flowers.</review>

Great place to enjoy the veiws of the whole city. It has great 360 degree veiws with clear days you can see for miles. This place is dog and kid friendly. Also, if you go a short distance there are a lot of places to eat before and after you come here. There is a nice single swing near the top too. You can get a good hike going around the park. On certain parts, you will need to have good footing but it is worth it. Overall, a great place to go.< /review>

It's great to camp overnight or daily. I enjoy watching some of the women jogging along the way. I can walk around naked without anyone caring. If I get too stoned or pass out from 'shrooms; I sleep it off on the hill. The place is convenient for conducting a ritual at midnight with my followers. We have a great view of the moon and Pluto.</text>

Views of San Francisco are not quite as stunning as from Twin Peaks,  but Bernal Heights is more fun since there are trails that allow you to walk up the hill without the risk of getting hit by a car. It's about a mile walk from the 24th Street BART station. Also, the weather here tends to be sunnier and less windy.</text>

Excellent views of the city and bay! A bit of an uphill climb (but you don't need anything more than decent walking shoes), and as usual for SF make sure to dress in layers.</Text>

<review>Not a well known place. You won't see a large crowd here. But this is a good spot to catch good view of the city. Also a good place to see all the fireworks during new years. You will find easy parking and just a 2 mins walk up the hill and the view is amazing..If you are visiting san francisco and want to avoid the crowd at twin peaks this is a good place to visit.</review>< rate>

Plenty of great views of the city that I've never seen before. It's not that far up of a walk either! Parking can be limited but it never seems to be too crowded when I've gone</review>

A mostly treeless park with great views of SF. There are some nice short walking trails around the building at the top. Great for picnics on a sunny day.</review>

<review>The best views of the city can be found on Bernal Hill. A must-see for all San Franciscans! Also, the loop around the hill is fairly flat and is just shy of 1 mile—perfect for a metered run or walk!</review>< Pictures>

<review>Take a short walk up from Precita Park to enjoy an awesome view of the city. There are usually dogs running around, someone with a guitar will inevitably show up and start playing, and if you're lucky you can swing on the swing and feel like a kid again.< /review>< pictures>

Best view in San Francisco, Fresh Air, Dog Friendly, Great place to get a workout in and the walk up the hills just to the view is also a workout.  This is one of my favorite places in San Francisco.<//text>

I come to Bernal Heights every weekend and it never get's old. I definitely wouldn't classify it as a "hike" per se, but it's more intense than you're average uphill walk (depending on if you take the road or one of the many dirt paths).
It's a great place to:
- see an amazing panoramic view of the city
- catch a sunset
- walk your dog
- sit and talk with a friend
- meditate / do yoga with a view

Check it out! Note: in the summer/dry season.. Bernal get's very dry!! After the wet season, Bernal is super green and is a bit prettier (looks like the Shire from Lord of the Rings)<//review>

I was part business and part tourist. After getting used to the Neverending climbing and workouts, you find that you can get to just about anything you want, to do, or need in 20-30 minutes. 60 minutes from the beach or the mountains. Not too shabby!< /review>

(Translated by Google) The best of Sfo to walk or run (with caution since it is a hill) free and minimal risk of contagion (covid 19 or flu) there I saw the conjunction of Jupiter with Saturn, I took my family and it will not happen again until 800 years more the panoramic view of San Francisco is worth.

Please be careful as the wind is strong and your feet are bad. Good as a shooting place!
