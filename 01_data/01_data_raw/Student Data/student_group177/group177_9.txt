<review>Steve and the West Coast Muffler crew are the best! They took care of me back in 2007, and they took care of me again in 2021. I wouldn't go anywhere else. Exceptional customer service!</review><user_name>Edward V</user_name>< date>

Always excellent service and high quality work. My dad and I always bring our cars here for exhaust system work, the latest being my 2000 Ford Excursion for a catalytic converter. Past cars I’ve brought here were my 1936 Chevy Pickup, 1990 Jaguar XJS V12, 1997 Dodge B3500 van, and 2002 BMW M5; all for different types of exhaust work.<//review>

Great customer service, honest desire to help. My catalytic converted was stolen and West Coast Muffler was the 4th shop I reached out to. I was told what I can do to save money I didn't need to spend. The work on top of that was grade A work and I highly recommend this shop for any services you need that they offer.< /Text>

Contacted Steve and left a brief message on doing some work done on my exhaust, next day he called me up and put me down for the day I had suggested in my message. I had a bad tailpipe and resonator with multiple holes from Wear and tear over years. I wanted to slightly modify it but staying true to the original sound.I had a vision and within a few hours hand crafted my pipe and did some extremely professional work and exactly what I had visioned at a incredible price.<//text>

Several years ago, the exhaust pipe on my '95 Del Sol Vtec got snapped on the freeway due to debris I couldn't avoid.  Concord Honda wanted to charge me 350.00 just to tell me they couldn't do the repair.  I asked my chiropractor, Dr. William Haley (who's awesome) who he could recommend to repair my car.  Without hesitation, he recommended West Coast Muffler, and said they had done wonderful work on his cars.  I called them, and had my car towed there.  Apparently, my car originally had a curved pipe leading to the muffler.  I got a call about an hour after they got my car, and I was told they could custom make another curved pipe, but that it would be far cheaper, and just as stable, for them to put on a straight pipe. The difference in price was about 400.00.  They could have just done the more expensive job.  I wouldn't have known any better.  But they gave me an option, so I of course took the less expensive route.  I've never had any problems with the replacement pipe, and I recommend their shop to anyone who will listen.  Thanks again for the great work, great customer service, and most of all, the great ethics.<//text>

<Text>Steve and West Coast muffler do outstanding work, are super helpful, friendly and highly recommended. I brought a little old Honda Elite 80 exhaust/muffler to get repaired and they did a fantastic job, even cleaned and coated the unit with rust inhibiting paint! Looks brand new and saved me lot's of $$!<//Text><user_id>115229835944196976519< /user_id><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

I have used West Coast Muffler a couple of times now. They dueled my truck before. This time they added K&N CAI system. Both visits Steve provided excellent work and service.

I grew up knowing the sign of a good automotive service business is that it is a busy business. West Coast Muffler is a busy business.< /text>

Love this place! I have taken 4 Trucks to them for exhaust and brake work. Great service, very friendly and the quality is suburb. The welds are so much better then other places Ive been. All three trucks were show trucks and came out excellent. Thanks Steve and staff! Also very good prices for the work they do.< /review>

<Text>So my Saturn had a exhaust leak I thought. I took it to Certified Tire in Concord and left it. I got a call later fr,om them telling me that I had an exhaust leak at the manifold. I knew that so can you fix it? No they said, you gotta go to a muffler shop. Oh and by the way, its gonna be $62.50 for us to tell you that we cannot fix it. I took the car to Steve at West Coast. This cat used a stethoscope to find my exhaust leak! He then told me that he could not get to it now and had to order parts since it was a holiday weekend and gave me a accurate quote to fix it. He also said that I did not owe him ANYTHING since I did not fix it. There were tons of custom hot rods all over and the place reeked of So-Cal hot rod heaven. I will take it back to him next week. This cat was decent, shop was spotless and he had integrity.< /Text>< Pictures>

West Coast is wonderful.  They essentially built my '67 Camaro with an LS2 drive-train and completing a great resto-mod.  The car is featured in some of the photos (blue-white).

Steve was great at managing the project and it moved quickly with the expert help at his disposal.  The car is the best conversion I've seen thus far - a joy to drive!

You won't find a better or more honest person to deal with your needs.<//Review>

<text>hello i had a 1974 chevy 4x4 that my dad had since 1975 and it was just passed down tho family from my brother then to me .. anyways i took my truck to West Coast Mufflers to get a pipe fixed cause i had one blow though the mounding plate that bolts to header and Steve fixed and he it wont do it again .. i asked him how it did that and he who ever put those pipes on they didnt crimp it right.

then a month or so later i had Steve put some used Flowmaters on it.. it had glass packs on it when my dad had it. and i dont like noise they did so i took them off and put flowmaters on it .. and hour or so later Steve said it was done ... boy it sound so much better. and i'll take my cars and trucks back to Steve again.

just 6 months ago my g/f has 64 chevy Impala and want him put some new pipes and flownaters on it and he (Steve) gave a price of $700 to $800 bucks. and of
course my g/f cant afford that. and i told my g/f i rather have West Coast Mufflers and Steve to put them on.. what did she tell me lol ... i cant afford it ugh! well we're
still driving it with those old pipes and worn out glass packs. and darn car being a X-body car it hard to route pipes for it with lots of bends and turns and alit of it is the
labor to do it. so i might have just buy my own mufflers and pipes and just have Steve
bend pipe make it fit. and i hope it just pay for his labor and time to do it..

oh and i'll rec other people to West Coast Mufflers :)

again i was very impressed in Steve and his work. GREAT JOB!!

Upon putting the van on a lift for inspection, Steve tack welded the hanger back together for the most minimum of charges.  I still had the rest of my lunch hour. Bravo Steve!< /review>< Pictures>

My new favorite spot for authentic clay pot rice dishes. Absolutely fantastic little gem in San Gabriel valley. Authentic Hong Kong style clay pot rice dishes and herbal steam soups. Ribs and preserved sausage, cured pork sausage with taro, and frog herb (Wei Kei) steam soup, all good eats.</Text>

<review>First time ate here, referred by my friends. It's hard to find parking to have a meal here, their parking lot is so small so be ready for a longer walk and park somewhere further. Long waiting time if you come here during busy hours. The place is small, only few tables setting but their food are tasty, prices are pretty decent and customer service was great< /review></record></dataset><record>

Absolutely love the menu here, apparently it's a classic hole in wall establishment with over 30 years history. Really authentic Cantonese food, the type of food mom and grandmom would cook, very good home-cooked comfort foods. And some really nice clay pop dishes are excellent too (like frog legs lol). 5 stars!</Review>

<text>A strong contender for best claypot rice in town. They have lunch special clay pots that are smaller in portion (but still cooked with lots of love) compared to their dinner counter parts. Their sauce is a weird oyster sauce blend, unfortunately, instead of being a sugar+soy sauce+white pepper mix.<//text>< date>

<Review>Not a bad spot for clay rice pot. I've driven by this restaurant for so many years without realizing what they served here. I came to know the name thanks to the sisters from HangryDiary when they mentioned this restaurant is their favorite for rice pot. Hailing from Hong Kong, I love all types of clay rice pots, especially the crispy rice on the bottom. So going into Nature Pagoda, I had high expectations as to their taste.

I came here alone on a Monday afternoon and it was very quiet. There were only 2 other tables occupied by groups but the workers had a lot of time on their hands. I ordered their lunch portion preserved meat rice pot, which also came with a small soup. I don't know the exact name but it tasted a lot like chicken soup with winter melon but I could be wrong. Once the pot came out, I waited a couple minutes before digging in because I wanted the rice at the bottom to get even crisipier so that I can struggle and dig for it at the end of the meal.

Overall taste was just okay; the soy sauce they provided was more on the salty side and not sweet enough. Soy sauce for this dish needs to be dark and sweet in order to fully enjoy it. The amount of meat was less than abundant but then again, it was a lunch portion. The part I was longing for was a disappointment though. Not enough crispy rice at the end but there still was some so enjoy at least, which is why I gave this place a four. I honestly believe I would come back and try other dishes in the future but I'll just stick to a different restaurant for my clay rice pots because I get a lot more crispy rice.<//Review>< time>

< Review>
First time here, a bit disappointed with the hot clay pot rice, rice not fully cooked and no crispy burnt rice at the bottom. Didn’t use soy sauce, instead used a very starchy oyster-liked sauce. Expected chicken thigh or leg instead of white meat, too starchy and very little meat.< /Review>

This is the place I go for the clay hot pot for the rice, and I sometimes drinks soups and herbal tea here because it is traditional (I mean it is not very sweet for herbal tea). The service here is good but sometimes need to wait for the seat because the place is small. Therefore, overall I recommended their Hog's Stomach with Ginkgo Nuts and Ribs with Preserved Sausage because it is very good in my opinion. I definitely come back here more often especially for lunch time because it has very good prices for the clay pot rice.< /text>

Been going to this place since they open years ago. It's only getting more and more popular nowadays. The Hong Kong style claypot rice is delicious. The offer many Choices for the rice topping. And they also offer traditional Chinese herbal soup.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) The food was good, but the clerk didn't dare to compliment him. He called to make an appointment to pick it up. But when I arrived, she said she didn't understand what I described. (It’s okay if you don’t hear the words clearly, super impatient). Hang up the phone without saying a few words, and then keep pulling English. It can only remind the friends to be careful about the waiter's face.

(Original)
吃的不错，店员态度不敢恭维，打电话订餐约好时间来取，到了却说我描述的她没听清？（没听清好好说话也行，超级不耐烦的那种）打电话没说几句直接挂断电话，再打一直拽英文，只能提醒小伙伴们小心服务员甩脸色了</Text>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) A friend introduced it. The taste of the clams is small. The taste is very general. The waiter sees that you are a northerner who basically ignores you. At the time of checkout, the tip is not much to ask you to make up! I have never seen such a cow shop! Desserts are not very good. I don't know how to get the four and a half stars? Those who pay for it!

(Original)
朋友介绍而来 煲仔饭菜少 味道很一般 服务员看你是北方人基本对你爱答不理。结账时小费给的不多还叫你补！我是没见过这么牛的店！甜品更是不怎么样。不知道怎拿到的四星半？花钱请的人吧！</Review>

<rate>1</rate><Text>(Translated by Google) Today around 8:10 PM my friend and I bought two cups of drink for around $5. But we gave the cashier $20, and she only returned us $4 change. So we were telling the cashier we gave her $20 but she said she only receives $10. We wanted to check the camera, but the cashier refuses to,so we lost $10 to nowhere. I advise everyone to be careful when you eat/ drink here.
It should be around eight o'clock tonight, and my friend and I came to this store to buy two cups of herbal tea, which totaled more than five yuan. We gave a 20 yuan to the cashier but she only gave us more than 4 yuan. I told her that we had given her a sheet of 20 yuan but she denied it, so we wanted to watch the video recorder and she would not let us watch it, so we suggest that if you come here to consume in the future, please pay more attention when paying.

今天晚上大該 八點多我和朋友一起來這家店買兩杯涼茶ㄧ共五塊多。我們拿一張20 塊給收銀員但是她只找給我們4塊多。我告訴她 我們已給她一張二十元但她否認，所以我們想看錄影機 她也不要讓我們看，所以我們建議大家以後如果有來這裡消費， 付錢時請多注意。< /Text>< Pictures>

<text>(Translated by Google) The opening time is 11:30am, I am the first guest, and then there are guests coming in, but the strange thing is that my first order is not my get food first. A little inexplicable production order, let the guests wait.

(Original)
开门时间是11:30am，我是第一个客人，然后后面还有客人陆续进场，但是奇怪的是我第一个order却不是我get food first.有点莫名其妙的制作顺序，让客人白等。<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<text>I was looking for a good place to repair my shoe and decided to get it repaired here. Sam and his wife provided great service the entire time I was there. Their smiles and great personalities brightened my day! They greeted me in a way where I felt like I was with family. Sam repaired my shoe quickly and efficiently. I recommend this shop to anyone who needs repairs done. You won't regret coming here. I would give this place ten stars if I could. Thank you again for the wonderful service!<//text>< pics>

< review>
I brought in my Army uniform top. All they needed to do was replace name tapes and rank. It took them 3 chances, the first set of patches they ruined. After the third strike i took my uniform knowing i would have to by new name tapes, rank, and pay some one else to fix this mess.  The name tapes were never straight (they literally just needed to align them with the old stitching).  None of the stitches are straight, and of the three corrections they needed to make, the name tape was about 15 degrees from straight, as in you could visibly see that the name tape was laudably crooked.

I am out 2 sets of patches and three weeks of time. I will never return.< /review>

I have used this dry cleaning place for over 1 year and they cannot seem to get it right. They send me weekly emails to ask for a pickup date of my dry cleaning & they never come on that date. I consistently have to call the store and see why they skipped me and when they can come and that goes the same for delivery as well. The manager Maria has compensated me for the inconvenience several times BUT this time today when it happened again and I called......She interrupted me, She told me it’s best if I go elsewhere & she refuses to serve me. Now, I’ve contacted corporate and hope I have a better outcome with them. I am a loyal and expensive customer for FLAIR cleaners to lose.<//text>

I’ve never had any issue with dry cleaning or alterations here. They text & email you when your items are ready to pickup. Open on Sunday’s as well, which is very convenient compared to most cleaners.< /Review>

<Time>1583191291395</Time><rating>1< /rating><Review>I came to Flair cleaners for alterations out of convenience as my regular cleaners is 30 min away. Never again. The older gentleman who does the alterations refused to alter my pants without my boots even after I told him I am particular about how i like my pants and am always measured without my boots for this reason. He kept refusing to help so because I needed them done asap I put my boots on only to find out that my pants are still extremely long!! Also I dropped them off last Sunday and did not get them back until yesterday (Thurs). If you're going to keep my pants for that long at least alter them correctly! I also wanted this particular set dry cleaned after the alterations were done...$12 for a uniform, smh...Flair cleaners did not get the job done to satisfaction and are extremely over priced. Next time I'll just go to my regular cleaners where they are happy to help me no matter what and I can get my alterations done in one day and dryclean my items at a MUCH more reasonable price.

Update: I was able to speak with the management of Flair Cleaners and we were able to rectify the situation in a manner that was satisfactory for all involved. Thank you Mr. Singer for your prompt attention to this matter.</Review>< Pictures>

<text>Open 7 days a week. How convenient is that! I needed some baggy pants hemmed to the correct length. They came out perfect. Nice work. Gaby was very helpful and the man that does the tailoring was very knowledgeable.  Just wished I had known you can go online and click on coupons and get discounts. I will be doing that next time.  I was told what day they would be done but got an e-mail the day before I expected telling me they were ready.  Now that is customer service.</text>< Pics>

Awful service!! Second time in only eight months the driver has “forgot” to pick up the dry cleaning. Called four hours ago and I’m still waiting for a call back for them to resolve. The person who answered the phone was not knowledgeable in any procedures and had zero clue what to do.

Awful. Wouldn’t recommend them AT ALL. I would’ve given them 0 stars but that want an option.

Go somewhere else!<//Text>

<text>Dry Cleaning: Great
Altering: Terrible
Dry cleaning is great (5 stars). They are “green,” using environmentally-friendly dry cleaning methods.  But very bad at altering (1 star).
I believe it depends on who does the altering.  I had them hem one pair of pants and it was done perfectly, just like it was sold that way.

I came back a week later and had another pair of pants hemmed (same fabric, different color) and they did such a strange job with exposed fabric tape that left the fabric falling off.  I came back again and asked them to do it like the original pants and even showed an example to a person who sews. They hemmed it, but didn’t tuck in the cut edge, just left it out unsewn and fraying.  I had to put clear nail polish on it to stop the fraying.  I’m astounded at such a completely unprofessional altering job.

Update: I found that SCV Cleaners in Canyon Country does the best job with alterations.< /text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Normally reliable. Good coupons. Had an experience recently where they couldn't find my order. I was in no hurry and they said they'd call me as soon as they found it. They never called back letting me know they found it and really didn't seem to care they made me wait. I'm just glad i wasn't in need of the garment immediately.  Just a disappointing and somewhat worrying experience.<//Review>

<name>Tony Hicks</name><user_id>110222635134269630355</user_id><Text>Their tailoring services is terrible and their dry cleaning is just like everywhere else. I am trying a different dry cleaners now to compare. (2017)
I failed to take my own advice and went back to Flair for tailoring and dry cleaning. The tailor was not able to fix either of my suits after having them both for a week. I went to Men's Wearhouse and they fixed both, no problem.

So to be clear. My order was not ready, it was not right and it was not free (I had also requested the tailoring order to be dry cleaned which was not done).

I will NOT be back.< /Text></record>

<Text>First time at a dry cleaners not recommended by family! My iron broke and I had to take all my clothes in! I came in requesting press-only and Patty was very helpful giving me price break-down and trying to give me the best bang for my buck! Pick-up was super fast and the service was completed overnight! 24 hr turn-around! This place rocks!!! They also found my husband's pocket square in his suit jacket and returned it to me in a little baggie! #realtalk so pleased and worth the expense!</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

I liked the friendly service and the accessibility to coupons. They also have Facebook specials if you like their page. I had been going somewhere that the people just seemed unhappy. Now, I'm at Flair, and was really happy with the experience.</review>

They had given away my sons shirt that went to his tux for our wedding, they gave us the suit pants in a bag looking like it was cleaned when I took it off the hanger I noticed it wasn’t cleaned and they never told me about it because there was a small rip in the pants, I live an hour away from flairs and I had to drive back 2 times to straighten out the problem they did buy me a new shirt and clean the pants<//review>

<Review>Cool screening room. I dunno what else you can do here as a visitor though. There's metered street parking and paid parking garage, pretty pricey, but I'd imagine only coming as a guest, so you can get it validated.< /Review><UserId.>112729167793190952850<//UserId.>< username>

<review>Lionsgate as a corporate office seems nice as a two day visitor. Their screening rooms are large, comfortable, and they provide popcorn for you. If you need a bite to eat or coffee, there's a small shop inside the office building!

For lunch, go out back and find Food Truck Alley!</review>< pictures>

You don't get what you pay for. You get the most basic wash even if you pay for the best wash they offer. They are not knowledgeable about the products they use. They use armor all on everything besides your tires including exterior plastics, dashboard and leather seats that will collect dust due to it being so sticky. If you go here only pay for the cheapest wash they offer because it's all the same no difference or special treatment.<//Review>

I had high hopes but service was sad, the place seems run down and my car was not cleaned well... maybe a 7 out of 10 on the clean scale. Not worth the $22 plus tip for a standard wash. And oh... if you get a wash that includes air freshener, you get to pick your favorite "tree" off the shelf.</Review>< user>

This is the worst and most overpriced car wash I've ever been to. The lobby looks like it hasn't been upgraded in 30 years and is filled with a mish mash collection of old uncomfortable chairs. The workers that dry your car and clean the interior have absolutely no attention to detail. I spent 10 minutes showing them all the spots they missed. Definitely  not worth $25.</Text>

Do not come here.
I spent $150 to wash two cars here and they not only left wax spots on the cars but they didn't even clean the interiors well. (not to mention they broke my cup holder slide cover).  I even paid for the headlight cleaning and they buffed over the grill of my car and come to see the next day they didn't even buff the headlights enough to make a difference, waste of $40.. could've put water on it myself and buffed it and might've come out cleaner.
Also just have to mention, the day i came here they backed up a guys truck somehow while it was in the wash and bent the driver door forward. How I didn't leave when i saw that is beyond me. Place is trash. FWYH< /review>

< Review>
I took my car recently and didn’t realize that when they wash or “hand wash” your car they use a brush instead of a sponge to clean your car, when I got my car I noticed scratches on my paint.my car is black so you can tell these  scratch lines.Its the employees job to ask if we want a sponge or brush wash before washing the car. I’m never taking my car here again.The pictures used on the website of a man hand washing your car is false advertisement , it does not hand wash your car.
Please wash your car elsewhere if you care about your paint job on your car.They don’t care asking you if you want a sponge or brush used to wash your car.< /Review>

Love it. Perfect car spa. They vacuum, wash the outside, clean the dash and windows inside and then hand dry it. All for $20.<//review>

New management.. didn't even wash my car right. They left a lot of pollen stains on my paint that I wiped off with my own microfiber cloth and quick detailer spray at home. Also the new head lot attendant accused me of not paying for my car wash. He had to run back inside to confirm even after to told him i paid he still didn't believe me. I've been coming to this car wash for over 10 years. I won't be back coming back after today's experience.< /Text>

Did a great job washing my car. Only thing I didn't like was that my front inside window wasn't completely streak free. I didn't notice until after I left and there was a glare hitting in a certain spot near the lower part of the front window.< /Review>

They washed my car and they still left bird poop and tree sap on my car. Also the windows were all streaked up and left towel lint all over the dash. They put an interior dressing on my dash and didnt even wipe it properly. It looks like they spilled oil on my dash and it looks all splotchy. Never going back.<//review>

Ok place. They have " We are not resposible for this machine, NO REFUNDS!" On everything ..so why have them then? Or fix them.  Customer service is ok. Lobby is clean and you can see your car being washed tjrpugh the windows inside.</review>

I love polish pros! I have been coming here every 2 weeks for a few months for Kathy to do my nails and she is AMAZING! I am very picky with my nails usually but she always does a perfect job with my acrylic and gel. Everyone here is very nice, they have a great selection of colors, and it’s very clean. I definitely recommend getting your nails done or a pedicure here.</Text>

I had pedicure yesterday. It was the worst experience I’ve ever had. She filed my skin on my toes. I is really bad. It has been blooding all night and today is swallowing and red. It hurts. I don’t recommend this place.</review>

Relaxing atmosphere. The woman that did my nails was funny and super friendly. She really took her time and did an excellent job with nail art. She asked a lot of questions to make sure I was getting what I wanted.</review>

This place is the best.  I've looked and looked and finally found the place... after another salon seriously damaged my big toe I had to find someone who really listened and cared.

Polish Pros opens early, which I LOVE.  Tracy and Darren are great and always try to accommodate your appointments.

Come in and give them a chance.   They accept credit cards but not for tips.   They have an ATM inside.<//Text>

<review>First visit/impression: Very nice place, service, and work. Best 'Classic' pedicure ever for what you pay. They even massage your legs and feet with these smooth hot stones, which I wasn't expecting at all but loved. Very happy with the paint job and selection of colors. Also happy with the eyebrow service. Worth every penny.

Edit: second time I went, the service was still somewhat nice, but the jobs themselves were not and it was ultimately a waste of money. Received what I paid for, but it wasn't thorough. Upon closer inspection, it looked like a 6 year old painted my nails and I ended up having to remove all the polish the next day.</review>< pics>

they only have one lady that can do acrylic nails. In reality they don’t have anyone that can do acrylic nails. If you want your whole finger covered in the acrylic then go there. Had the worst experience ever. Ended up leaving before my nails were even finished to go somewhere else. The lady at the next place even looked at them and was making comments about how awful they were done and looked. Don’t waste your time going to this place!

Also the pictures are definitely old because they do not even have tables. You sit in a pedicure chair to get your nails done. Not relaxing having your arm suspended in the air or having to reach across your body while they do your nails.</Text>

It may be awkward for some guys to get their nails done but these girls make you feel comfortable and relax. They clean my hands really well and help my nails look well kept.

I'm relatively new to the San Diego area and have been looking for a new nail salon and I've found it! Cari did my pedicure and did an awesome job on my nails as well as a great foot massage and made my feet baby soft! Janet filled in my acrylics and shaped them perfectly to how I wanted as well as did a phenomenal job on the design I wanted!! Highly recommend this place and these women and I'll definitely be coming back< /text>

On a business trip and decided to treat myself to a pedicure on my last day. WORST pedicure I've ever experienced. She did NOT clean my cuticles. It was almost as if she barely touched my feet. She barely shaped my nail. ABSOLUTE WORST!! I would NEVER go back or recommend anyone to go here. My techs name was Cari.< /review>

This is the second time ive gone. When i went on 3/19/19 they were acting like they didn't want to take off my acrylic nails and were rude about it. I sat down and the towel they gave me smelt a little moldy. I brushed it off and just took it. They put my fingers in acetone and began to file down the acrylic off my fingers. I asked them why they said my nails hadn't lifted i assured them they had or i wouldn't be there getting them off. So i sat there they filed down so much that they rubbed into my natural nail. I asked them to stop becuase it hurt and to use the machine they refused and said they couldn't. They continued to file my nail eventually cutting my skin. At one point they ask me what i wanted done on my nails as if i was going to get other nails or something. They had the nerve to still charge me after i complained that the acetone was burning my fingers. I made them stop and had another person use the machine to get off the access acrylic that they shaped on my thumb and ring finger. I'll never go here again.25 dollars to take off a full set that would have been 15 anywhere else. 2 and a half hours of pain that would have taken me 45 minutes at the mall and no pain. Don't go here.<//Text>

First timer, need to get nails done ASAP. I did my research and based on what I saw on their reviews, I admit lil iffy, but end result, I LOVED THEM, they were quick, Attentive, very lovely, I also loved the  great conversation with my nail tech, which btw who IS VERY sweet.

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE, I for sure will be back when I am back in town.

THANK YOU, my daughter loved them very much too :)</Review>

Super disappointed with pedi!! Shop looks clean and I was drawn in. More expensive than other places I've been and the quality of service is poor.  I paid extra for dead skin removal, none of which was removed! The massage was unmemorable and it was just an all around disappointment. I will not be returning.<//Review>

Getting a Ruby Pedicure was very worth it because of the wonderful callus scrub. They gave a wonderful scent and the staff did a perfect job with cleaning and polishing.</review>

One of the worst pedicures I've ever had. They took less than 20 min (and its a 30 min pedi). Didnt even listen to our requests. My fiances chair didnt work. Then they rushed us out of our chairs very rudely at the end. Don't trust the other reviews here, not a quality place.< /text>

Loved this place! I like to go thrifting and shop around the swap meet every sunday. After shopping for a bit, I came across this place. My feet never felt so good. Walking for a while really drains you out and hurts your feet but the massages felt so good. They have an amazing deal going on right now where mani and pedis are around 25ish dollars I think. Definitely will come back! All the workers are so cute with their matching black outfits haha.</text>

Horrible! First of all it's expensive for basic service. Girl uses my towel on her glasses then uses it on my feet. They had me give a review on Yelp and would not credit me $5 as promised for doing the Yelp review.<//Review>

Terrible teerible teerible !!!!!!!! My second time going first time was alright not great thought I would give it A second try well that was a total mistake they are way over priced for the service i wanted a fill and the lady totally reshaped my nail and said she didn't but none of them match the shape is total opposite of what I asked for the paint job looks totally messed up the gel color is all over my fingers and all blotchy not nice and smooth my toes on the other hand look like a 3 year old kid painted them the color is so messed up and no where near smooth this has by far been my worst experience ever !!!!! I do not recommend</review>

Terrible, I don't like dogs and the outside. Only reason I went was because I was blackmailed, the whole park gave me a head ache. Smelled vile, also the dogs were annoying. Not thats my words mean anything. I just don't like the park, or outdoors for that matter. Its was a nice view I saw though, I can't deny that<//Text>

Posting a 1 because I’ve come to this park during the day hours to include on weekends 4 times now. Of the 4, they closed the dog park area 3 times. So the only 1 time it was open it was during summer and just too hot as there is absolutely no shade and limited seating.  It appears the City is doing a lot more to beautiful the land space but I’m not sure why the dog areas are closed.  If you check on line when pulling up directions it will not indicate closed so you have to drive there.< /Text>

First Star: Is the location neat? Yes. The trash is never overflowing and the bags are kept well-stocked. The grass is kept neat and the structures are well-maintained.

Second Star: Is the staff friendly? N/A. Free Star.

Third Star: Is the service prompt? Yes. Even under construction the park was always open. The work was done quickly, despite several rain delays.

Fourth Star: Is the product/service satisfactory? Yes. The park is large and has plenty to do for dogs of all sizes. Some more shade would be nice, but that's a matter of patience as the surrounding trees mature.

Fifth star: Is the price acceptable? N/A. Free Star< /text>

This dog park is wonderful! It is big and has lots of places for the pooches to run around and play, it even has an agility course for aspiring dog show enthusiasts! The only downside is that when it rains the park becomes muddy and unusable.< /text>

It is a beautiful, Immaculate Park that has not only a large grass area for dogs to run and a water feature for them to be able to drink it has a second part that has and Agility course set up with all the obstacles for you to train your dog. This is a new park and they have planted trees that will some day provide shade for people and dogs who visit. There is a parking lot as well as street parking available. Adjacent to this park is a small kids park. It has water fountains that spout up that kids can run through. Benches placed around the water play area for adults. No shade for this area until the trees grow to provide shade. Picnic tables under shade. It's only negative for me is the"no shade."<//text>

People can be finicky and funny. Dog parks are very much use at your own risk.  There is a large all size dog area. I don’t personally go in there with my 10-15 lbs dogs. I stick to the small dog area and if empty, the agility area. All three are very much separate by metal gates. There are water fountains for drinking, dog potty stations and trash cans (you can easily lean over the medium height fence and throw away a used bag). I’ll add photos to show all this (and I’m only 5’3”). It is true though that there is NO shade in the dog areas, but it is very nice and plush grass! The agility area is nice and my small dogs can climb up it so I think it’s fine for all sizes. It has been very quiet this summer. Busiest on weekday evenings.</Text>

<text>Dog park sucks. It all really has to do with the city maintaining it and the way they maintain it. I don't even know if it has been open as many days as it was under construction. People don't pick up after their dog at this park. Why would they not install the doggie bags inside the dog area?<//text>< gmap_id>

<Rate>4< /Rate><review>The park has a small parking lot, and considering it's in a neighborhood I can only imagine how packed it will get on the weekends.  The park is made of four yards; the children's park, and three yards for dogs.
The largest is for large dogs. Nice running area.
The second smallest is for small dogs.
And the third is the agility yard.

The expectations I had were low since most parks in the contra costa area are left to turn into garbage and filled with fox tails which are very dangerous for dogs.

The park is near a dump of property which brings my concern of rodents that will most likely cause holes in the lawns.

My concern is how people didn't bother to ask if they can bring in their larger dogs into the agility yard when there's small dogs in there.

And the most disappointing issue I have for the summer is there's NO SHADE. In the heat how could they not plan for shade in the summer??

The park is pretty and large- I'm pretty happy with the size of the small dog yard as they usually get stuck with less than a quarter of what large dogs get. My dogs love running and seeing them take off in the park was fun.

Mostly I have concerns about the lack of shade.< /review>< pictures>

Large area set for different size dogs.
Enough room for working out without getting in the way of others.
Water and trash available.
Very clean except for a few that did not clean up after themselves.
No shade but it was nice in the morning.</Text>

This dog park is amazing; the only thing I would like to add is, it would be nice to have a few covered locations inside the actual dog park that way we won't stand or sit in the sun.</Text>

One way gates are a problem waiting to happen. Someone will be injured in these gates as they are now configured.
Dog litter bag dispensers should be inside the play areas not outside, same for the garbage cans.
Bolts sticking up on the agility play structure, hidden by bark, dangerous for people and dogs.
The agility ramps on the structure are slick and too steep.
As mentioned in other reviews, the distinction between agility area, small dog area, large dog area is blurred and invites injury to small dogs. Why not put a second agility setup in the large dog area too?
Need to install shade structures similar to the ones in Brentwood dog parks. There is zero shade.<//Text>

Koda park opened today! We didn't go to the ceremony because it was too hot but we came around 11am and there was still a lot of people.

There is a small dog park and a big dog park. There is also an agility park with a couple things in it. It was very nice but obviously structured for big dogs.

The reason I give 4 stars is because; All three sections have no shade. The poop bags and trash bins are only located outside of the yards too, which was inconvenient. Otherwise the grass was so nice and the yard was large for both.< /text>

Very elegant and welcoming spot. They offer large portions and for reasonable rates. I liked the menu very much and the staff were super welcoming and explanatory. Highly recommended.</review>

<review>This place is cute. We went there for a dinner after gym session. It as empty on a Friday night and the food came pretty quick.
However the food portion wasn't very big, or fair considering the prices. From what I remember, they have decreased food portion.
Anyone else felt the same way?

I gave 4 stars because my bf is sweet and convincing. Honestly I'd give 3.5 stars if it's an option.<//review>< Pictures>

$10 for this Pao de queijo? The orange juice is processed. Not even close to a real Brazilian place.</Text>

<review>Place has a lot of great food and a great vibe. The service was pretty fast and we were able to enjoy our meals. The portions were very big and we ended up having quite a bit of leftovers. Would recommend this place to get some Brazilian food which you don't see very often around here.<//review>< pics>

<Review>The shack (Brazil Fresh Squeeze Cafe) on University and Walnut is definitely much more famous and popular, but this place is great if you want somewhere indoors that serves the same food.

They have the same awesome tri tip that you'll get at the shack but it's an indoor sitdown place so you can visit here if the weather isn't super good or if you're in the mood for a more "restaurant-y" environment.<//Review>< Pics>

<text>I was craving Brazilian food, specifically, feijoada, so I decided to stop by Pedro's Brazil Cafe for the first time. Unfortunately, the meats were chewy, dry, and hardly had flavor. The rice also tasted like it came from a boil-in-a-bag, or it was microwaved rice. Additionally, the service was not great. I sat down and waited for ten minutes - I wasn't greeted or even acknowledged. But I may have come in at a bad time. People were switching shifts (It was at around 5 PM). Pros: I think they have a cute space and great seating outside. I think it has potential to be a good restaurant, but their food needs more love. There aren't many Brazilian restaurants in the Bay Area, so maybe competition isn't fierce enough to get this place's food where it needs to be.</text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

I wouldn't come here from the other side of the city, but definitely a great option if you live near by.< /text>

As good as it gets, Ive never been to Brazil before, but when i come to this place i swear i can have a sense of the happy Brazilian vibe. The food is very tasty and their is something about the sauce that makes you want to have another bite.< /text>

<text>First time I come to this place and it was pretty amazing. The tri-tip and chicken plate were spectacular. Also if you’re a lover of desserts, try the passionfruit mousse. Great music playing in the background which makes you want to samba in your seat! Highly recommend the place if you’re in the area :)< /text>< user_name>

<text>A staple of my Berkeley diet. Yes, please, go eat this. Support this amazing place.

Flavorful, fun, and unique to Berkeley. This is always on my list of places to take friends when they come visit. Often a bit of a wait to order and to get your food, but it's worth it every time.

Be on the look out for the man himself! He comes to visit pretty frequently.< /text>< response>

<Text>Came here for the first time after a long hike! I'd always seen the little shack but didn't know they had a sit-down restaurant. The restaurant even has a nice patio in the back, perfect for a nice day! Ordered their hot plate with tri tip and it was so delicious, i didn't get a chance to take a picture of it. I had a BOGO coupon thanks to dining advantage and the waiter took the coupon and even allowed me to check in on yelp for a mango smoothie! Service is great and they're very attentive making sure you're enjoying the food.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

It’s not worth it!
First of all, the prices that you see on the menu here are not the ones on the menu at the restaurant. The hot plate prices showed here are prices for small plates!
Secondly, they charge a lot for too small portions.
And finally, that is not brazilian food at all! I ordered a tri-tip plate and got a shredded tough meat over rice and cheese sided by bread! And it tasted awful!< /review>

<review>The only reason I give this restaurant 4 stars out of 5 is because there is usually a long wait. The food is absolutely worth the wait. I particularly love the tri-tip. The decor is tasteful and interesting, and the staff was friendly and helpful.</review>< time>

I had this food delivered so I cannot comment on the service or ambience. The pao de queijo and coxinhas are legit.  Definitely Pricey considering the small portions, but I was so happy to have these foods I'd buy them again.
The brigadeiro however is disappointing if you've had real brigadeoros. These taste just like chocolate pudding with sprinkles. Not the overly sweet, chocolatey, condensed milk, balls of heaven they should be.< /Text>

<Review>I've been coming here ever since my days at Cal. This is one of the places where I'd come to forget my sinking GPA, my overdue assignments, my bank balance and literally all misery of my life.

Sitting out in the sun on the patio at the back, on a Saturday, eating some warm and comforting feijoada and sipping on the cool mango slushies was as good as it got.

Ever since the Butcher's son moved next door, I've seen a lot less traffic here. In its heyday, feijoada would be over before 1 in the afternoon! It was that popular! I try to come here often to reminisce about the past, though not as much as before unfortunately. It still is one of my favorite spots for brunch in Berkeley. Definitely recommend this place.< /Review>< Time>

<Review>Orders can sometimes take a while. Even when the place was nearly empty, it still took longer than I expected. However, with that being said, the pork is absolutely delicious. Rice, sauce, onions are all great. Chicken was good but a little disappointing, a little on the dry side.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

Was really nice here. Came with family and friends. We had a big group of about 10 people and they happily served us all while getting our food out to us very fast. Tasty! Just don't get anything chipotle or jalapeno related there. It's spicier than youd expect.< /text>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>Great service and food! I wish I could give this place a six stars or something haha

I came here with a group of nine and we were seated right away. We called beforehand to make sure there were enough seats. Our waiter Mattheus (I hope I'm spelling his name right) was really friendly, down-to-earth, and efficient! He saw that we all checked in and brought us our mango smoothies right away. He was always checking and asking if the food was good and if we needed anything else.

The mango smoothies are really refreshing and delicious, so don't forget to check in! The tri-tip steak is a must try regardless of what form (sandwich, rice bowl) it's in. The tri-tip sandwich is heavier and a bit messier to eat than the rice bowl, but both are really good! The sauce used for the steak is amazing!!! I highly recommend this place!<//text>< Pics>

the carne asada is straight up ridiculous. this restaurant is easily one of my favorite places to eat. period. the food here is to die for, everything they have on the menu is delicious. they have specials depending on what day it is and they are very reasonably priced and even more delicious. I came across this place by chance and I am so glad that I did. I am a repeat customer and I am sure you will be too if you give pedro a try!< /Text>

Posting as an Uber eats driver. Came to this spot to pick up a delivery and waited 30 f****ing minutes. They had 2 couples inside who already were seated and had their food. What took so long? Beats me but I will never accept another delivery there again.
They have good ratings... Haven't tried their food. So my rating is again.. only based on an Uber eats driver.</text>

Delicious Brazilian food can be found here. The chicken stroganoff comes with crunchy noodle-like crackers and even though the sauce looks like butter chicken, the taste is delicious.

Their tri-tip is their specialty, though. We ordered the tri-tip plate and it was the best dish among those we ordered. Meat is tender and the side salad is refreshing. Their cilantro sauce is also yummy.

Place is kinda small, so you maybhave to wait to get a table.< /text>

It has free cardio and adjustable resistant exercise equipment in a private room. The people are friendly and there is always someone to talk to if you are willing to be friendly.
If you wish to participate in lunchtime with company, it is available for a donation. All kinds of games, classes in what might interest you, bingo, group entertainment, musical exercise classes, and more.< /review>

A little difficult to find, however, it is really nice, clean, people were friendly. Staff was very helpful, professional, and the center was busy and seemed to have a lot of things going on.<//Text>

<Review>The Moreno Valley Senior Center offers a lot of good activities for seniors, for some, it is their home away from home.  As a volunteer Dancercise instructor, the opportunity to do so has truly enriched my life knowing it benefits senior's health and well-being.   Reta B.< /Review><Name>Reta Butler<//Name></record>

I am so grateful for finding Yucaipa Dental for my daughter! They are absolutely wonderful. We are new to the area and needed to find a new dentist. After seeing such positive reviews, I decided to check them out. I am glad I did! The five star review rating is 100% spot on. The entire process from start to finish is excellent. Most importantly, the entire staff and dentist himself are amazing. My husband and I are looking forward to switching over as well.<//review>

<Review>Dr.Markham continues to be the best dentist, not only in the area, but all around. Dr. Markham and his staff are friendly, kind, and honest. You would be lucky to have one of these traits in a good dentist, but to have all three of these traits in a GREAT dentist is absolutely amazing. If you are looking for a dentist, look no further.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

I was amazed that Dr. Markham could replace my cracked crown in one day.  I have been in a lot of pain with this tooth.  It is so nice to have it taken care of so quickly.  Also happy with the staff.<//Review>

I’ve been going to Yucaipa Dental now for years now. 0 complaints, nothing but great memories, great staff, great treatment and great service. Dr. Markham is a stellar guy! Very patient and professional! They all know how to put a smile on your face. Shoutout to Brittney for being 100/10 in every category of her service. She’s such a kind hygienist and she makes me look forward to my visit. Definitely recommend to anyone who needs any kind of dental work!< /review>

Best dentist office around! Dr. Markham is amazing! He’s knowledgeable, considerate, and down to earth. The receptionist, Erica is always friendly and super helpful. I’ve seen a handful of hygienists that work there and they’ve all been great! I’ve been to other dentist offices in the area and I’m so glad I finally found Yucaipa Dental! I highly recommend them!</text>

<text>Always a pleasure coming in to see Mark and his team. Very organized structure and their ability to multitask is bar to none compared to other dental offices I've seen. Speed does NOT lack quality and this dental team does their very best to get you out on time in case you need to meet your own scheduling needs. Erica and the front desk are very, very patient and provide premium customer service every single day. Highly recommed dental office for both dental and ortho needs. Just be sure to call and schedule appts as their system is appointment-based (which makes it super efficient for everyone). Keep up the fantastic job, Mark and team!< /text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

We need more stars.
Dr. Markham has cultivated an optimal work culture for his staff.
Every worker in this office is open, honest, and pleasant.

They live up to their “Care Comes First” mindset. They vow to never let money/insurance be a barrier to treatment.
Who else does that?

The lobby is always cool, clean, and comfortable.

The technicians make big small talk,
they’re well read and well led.

This is the Effectiveness of a small business operated by the 7 Habits.

Also, no sugar coating.
If you have been slacking on your teeth -
they will CALL YOU ON IT!

Integrity, Value, Climate.

Book now.
Or just show up.

The orthodontists are masterful.
The hygienists are adept, kooky,
and overwhelmingly positive.

They even referred my then 7 year old son to a pediatric dentist for treatment that was available in-house,
just to make for a more pleasant
kid-friendly experience.

Sent money to another office?
Who else does that?

As a retired veteran;
they seamlessly process Tricare Retiree Dental Plan insurance.

They take care of me ;
my wife and our 5 kids.
They handle over 200 teeth for us.

We are gonna need more teeth...< /review>

Literally, everyone in this office is so nice. They clearly all love their job and place of employment. The entire staff was kind, funny, caring, considerate and so, so positive. I don't think I've ever gotten that many compliments in one day. Sweetest hygienist, assistants and dentist! I can't imagine going anywhere else.
Side note: this trip was for a root canal. They treated me like royalty and made me feel so comfortable the entire time! LOVE Yucaipa Dental!<//Review>

I’ve had a few big cavities filled  By Dr Markham and I never felt the needle or the anesthetic!   I am amazed at what a light hand Dr has when administering the anesthetic it’s unbelievable.

I had never been to a dentist where I didn’t feel the needle or the anesthetic going in.

I recommend this Dentist and his awesome team!<//review>< username>

Very upbeat and on top of things. Friendly staff and Dr. Steven Markham sure knows how to make you feel calm. Also Dr. Markham is a very funny and handsome young man. Updated top notch  instruments.  Dr Markham and  staff are knowledgeable and smart as hell . My daughter is the one that  recommended them to me. I would also pass the good word out to my family and friends and recommend that they should go there.<//review>

I wish I could put more than 5 stars. This is the best dental office I have ever been to. Everyone is so friendly and really makes you feel welcomed. They make an effort to get to know you and make you feel comfortable. A lot of people fear going to any dentist because it can be painful. But both of the hygienist are very gentle when cleaning your teeth. And the doctor really makes an effort to make the whole appointment painless. They are also honest about the work you need done. Everyone in this office shows that they really care about you and your health. I highly recommend it above any other office!< /Review>

Never before have I been to any office so professional, so friendly and compassionate. Clearly their number priority is your absolute comfort. Dr Markham is by far the kindest and most dedicated Dr I've ever visited, and his team goes out of their way to put you at ease.
They are speedy and efficient, and their work has always exceeded expectations.
I cannot recommend them enough!</Text>

We've bounced around from dentist to dentist with various issues for close to 13 years looking for the right fit.  FINALLY we found a dentist we can call home!  Amazing, competent staff and very welcoming environment.  I mean seriously, how many parents have kids that WANT to go to the dentist?!?!  We have been supremely satisfied with the level of service we have received over the past 2 years with Dr. Markham and staff!</review>

Dr. Markham operates a great facility with staff that truly cares and who try to make each guest feel welcome, comfortable, and appreciated. Plus, he’s a friendly and personable guy. Brittany has been my dental hygienist a few times and she does excellent work. She is also very personable and genuine, and tries to make her clients feel at ease without rushing you out the door. My family and I have been Dr. Markham’s patients for over ten years, and I highly recommend him to anyone. They do great work, they give their all with a personal touch, and they don’t try to sell you something that you don’t need. Go check them out, you won’t be disappointed.< /text>

I've been visiting Yucaipa dental and orthodontics since the days of high school! Every time I have an appointment they remind me by sending out a text or a call prior to the day of scheduling.
The quality is in their work, and they do a superior job!<//review>

I'm very happy with yucaipa dental. Dr. Markham is very good, there's never any pressure, he explains the options, and you decide what's best for you. He's very conscientious about pain. That's important to me. So I will continue to see Dr. Markham as long as he's there. He's my Dentist!<//review>

<Text>Going to see Dr. Markham and his staff is like going to visit old friends. They are so warm and friendly! Kelli is my hygienist and I just love her! I forget I'm getting my teeth cleaned because we are catching up on the last six months. The same is true with Dr. Markham. He is hilarious but always concerned that you are comfortable doing okay. He will not do any unnecessary work and is very honest. We trust him completely. We have referred many friends and family and everyone will say the same thing, "They are wonderful! And going to the dentist is actually fun!"<//Text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80db511c6e0962b7:0xff3ae5bd25b81d62</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I recently moved to Yucaipa from Yorba Linda. I was asking my neighbor if she knew of a good dentist. She recommended her dentist, Dr. Markham. In my 71 years I've had good dentists and lately a series of not so good dentists. I went to Dr. Markham and found the staff to be welcoming and professional. Dr. Markham seemed to take a real interest in my issues. He developed a plan and explained the process. I have confidence in this doctor. I think I'm going to get my dental issues solved - finally.< /Text>< name>

Since Google won't let me leave another review- I'll write a new one. Yucaipa Dental has been the BEST experience. Dr. Markham is a remarkable person along with his staff. Bree aka The Grill Master is by far the best orthodontist. Everyone at the office makes you feel right at home. Thank you for all that you do guys and gals!< /Review>

I love going to Dr. Markham. All the people that work there are so friendly and helpful. I have been given new tips on dental care that no one has ever given me. Dr. Markham is great, he always takes the time to explain the best options for you. Even if you are not the to see him he still takes the time to stop and say hi. He is one of the nicest people I know. The staff makes you feel like your part of the family. I recommend them to everyone I know.</text>

<review>Everyone who works @ Dr. Markham's office is so friendly and helpful. I've always been nervous going to the dentist but not anymore. All rooms have video or music to play during procedures,  their equipment is super high tech, and they go out of their way to make you comfortable. Now I actually love going to my dentist and my teeth look fabulous!< /review>< gmapID>

Dr. Markham's office is exactly what you hope for in a dentist. Very friendly and sympathetic staff, and any jitters you may have going in are put at ease once he comes in and lightens the mood. His goal is your comfort and he is always asking if you are doing okay. I appreciate the time he and his staff take for my appointments. He and his team are awesome and I highly recommend.< /Review>

Dr. Markham and his dental team are the absolute best. I have historically avoided going to the dentist, but now I look forward to my visits, especially when I'm getting my teeth cleaned by Brittney. She is like a ray of sunshine on a cloudy day. Her attitude and caring for her patients is always positive and on display. I like that the office uses state of the art technology too. Heather at the front desk gives a great first impression as soon as you walk in. This is the place to go for your dental needs.  I'm glad I found them. Highly recommended!<//review>

<Text>Dr. Markham is such a great dentist. I’ve been seeing him for 11years and has never had a bad experience. The staff is always in great spirits and are so thoughtful. Dr. Markham is so gentle, caring and helps you understand each procedure that will be done on each visit. The assistants are just as caring.  Never have I been rushed out. Never have I had work done that was not needed. I have such respect for each and every person in his office. The hygienist are just as caring and are amazing. Very detailed.  I recommend Dr.Markham for all ages that needs dental care!!</Text>< pics>

Let me begin by admitting that I am infamous for always having cavities.. So you can easily infer that I am a dentist office regular. I have been to a variety of dentist and this is by far the best. This has completely changed my outlook on visits and even made it to where I actually look forward to seeing Dr Markham. This the place I look forward to bringing my future children!!</text>

I love Dr. Markham and his staff - when you walk into the office you are greeted like family.  Markham is an awesome Dentist due to a past dentist giving me post dramatic stress syndrome of the dentist I finally feel comfortable going to the dentist I do not squeeze the arms on the chair until my nuckles turn white. Markham is a caring dentist who will always ask if I am comfortable or in pain while he is filling or crowning a tooth.< /Review>

<text>My daughter & I have been very pleased Dr. Markham patients for about 1 year now. The office is uber clean, efficient & friendly. My daughter loves having Kelli as a hygienist. Today, my teeth were cleaned by a new (for me) hygienist, Brittany.  She performed her work professionally and has such a sweet demeanor. Dr. Markham really knows how to staff an office! I highly recommend this dental practice!< /text>< pictures>

Warm, caring and personable staff.  Dr. Markham is meticulous, with up to date equipment and expertise (and it does make a difference).  He's more empathetic than any dentist I've ever had, and I have encountered many over 50 years in different parts of the U.S.  He does not push costly procedures that may not be necessary, unlike others I've visited in Yucaipa and Highland.
Another visit to have my teeth cleaned during COVID-19 times:  sounds effusive for a visit to the dentist, but I had a great time and appreciate the cheerful atmosphere!<//Review>

<review>I was looking for a dental office after avoiding dental treatment for almost 4 years. I am so happy I decided to take a chance on Dr. Markham's office.
From reception scheduling with Heather to x-rays and patient work up with Ashley, it was smooth sailing and a completely relaxed setting. I had my check up with Dr. Markham who couldn't be more pleasant and I am so happy I came in and finally found a dental office where I know I will be taken care of.
I had my teeth cleaned later in the day by Britney and I have to admit she's the reason I came in, I know her personally. I highly recommend her and I am very pleased with my cleaning. I can't imagine anyone not enjoying a visit with Britney.< /review><Rate>5< /Rate>< Date>

Dr Markham and his team are the best group out there. I would highly recommend them to anybody who is looking for the best dental team around. I have been going to Yucaipa dental for 9 years and before that you couldn't get me to stay with a dentist because they were all about the money. Dr Markham and his team truly care about they're patient's and it shows in the way he treats them both in greeting them as well as while they are in the chair. No one can beat Yucaipa dental. Thanks to all the staff you guys are the greatest.</text>

I used to dread going to the dentist, but not anymore!  I actually enjoy going!  Dr. Markham  & his staff care about each  person that goes into their office.  I love everyone & could just sit & visit all day!  Very personable, warm & friendly!!! The very best dental experience of my entire life!  I wish I would have found them sooner!< /text>

<Text>Such a warm and caring dental office! Like most people, I’ve had my share of bad experiences with dentists. I recently moved to the area, so trying a new dentist had me really nervous and uneasy. My fears were almost instantly dissolved by the amazing front office staff. Heather was so kind and welcoming, I immediately felt at ease by her friendliness. Dr. Markham was incredibly patient with me and made my comfort an obvious priority to my treatment. Brittney was my dental hygienist and she was so gentle...I never knew I could actually enjoy getting my teeth cleaned!! I'm so incredibly happy I found this place!<//Text><GmapID>0x80db511c6e0962b7:0xff3ae5bd25b81d62< /GmapID><Name>Yoga wZen<//Name></record>

<Review>I love using this office for my dental needs. The staff is friendly and takes the time to listen to any concerns you may have. And they don't recommend any procedures you don't need like other places I've been to. I highly suggest giving them a try if you're looking for a dentist. So glad I was referred to them!< /Review><name>vinnie_86 A< /name>< user>

Dr. Markham and his entire staff are awesome! I'm not a fan of getting dental work done, but Dr. Markham and his staff made me feel like family and so comfortable. They are so personable and truly care about each and every patient. I have recommended Dr. Markham to my entire family and friends. Brittany (Dental Hygienist) and Heather (Insurance Person/Receptionist) are phenomenal! Cheers to you all. Good Job!!

My experience here with orthodontia/ braces for my kids has been fabulous. The previous review by the unhappy client that posted a negative review today is a joke and unnecessary. I was witness to this man who came in and acted very hostile towards the staff in a very aggressive manner. After being offered a discount, and paying in full, he was still not pacified. The staff was willing to bend over backwards for someone who clearly was looking to pick a fight. Unfortunately I had to witness the circus surrounding this Allen Petty guy while waiting for our appointment- making everyone in the room uncomfortable as this man was clearly oblivious to his surroundings.  This man’s Google review personally attacking Dr. Markham’s staff shows his lack of decency/ professionalism and his clear anger issues (you know, the loud, socially indignant guy in the room that causes everybody to immediately stare at the ground, so as to not get caught in the crossfire, then everyone finally dares to look up once he leaves)... As for my experience, I couldn’t ask for a better dentist/ orthodontist and the other 99.9% of Dr. Markham’s clients can attest to this. I, too, have been coming for years, and would describe Dr. Markham as professional, efficient, and, most of all- friendly.  He’s great with kids and teens. His staff is equally as amazing, and the ortho tech is a wizard at her trade- and my kids’ teeth look great!</Text>

<review>Dr. Markham is a dental Rock Star and is equally as stellar a human. Kelly (my hygienist) and the rest of the staff are also dental studs and over the years have become like family to me. Going to the dentist has never been as much fun as it is here. They know their stuff and they are the sweetest, most genuine and positive people. One a scale of one to ten I’d give Yucaipa Dental a 25! Nuf said.< /review>< username>

Excellent staff - very kind, professional and empathetic.  They were great with me and my kids. I just had my gums deep cleaned by Brittany and it was practically painless.  Several years ago I had my gums deep cleaned at a place in Redlands and it was horrifyingly painful. This was the opposite.  I also got to meet Dr. Markham‘s father (also a dentist) who was covering for him this week. He was very nice too.  Thank you for having a professional and friendly business here in Yucaipa.</review>

<username>Joe Strange<//username><time>1531801389508</time><rate>5<//rate><Text>After dreading finding a new dentist and having an incredibly bad tooth infection which required a root canal, I was referred to Dr Markham. They made time during a busy day to see me right away for an emergency consultation and completed the root canal a couple days later once the infection was more controlled. I was DREADING the procedure. The procedure was not what I expected at all. I felt ABSOLUTELY NO pain and was comfortable the entire visit. They even crafted a crown onsite and I did not have to come back for a different visit to complete the procedure. Dr. Markham, Trish and his entire team were AMAZING! I do not plan on looking for a new dentist in the near future or quite possibly ever again. You will not be disappointed!</Text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

Dr. Markem and his staff are amazing! They have gone out of their way to make my family and I feel valued and comfortable with our dental visits. Dr. Markem is an excellent dentist who is extremely talented! We thought my daughter would have to live with the damage to her teeth caused by many illnesses, breathing treatments, and steroids in her young life. Dr. Markem was able to fix my daughter's smile and, in turn, boosted her confidence exponentially! I cried when I saw her beautiful smile finally reflect the beauty within her. I will forever be grateful! I can't thank you enough Yucaipa dental staff!!!❤< /Review>

The office is beautiful as well as the woman at the front desk. I felt welcome when I Walked in the door. No wait time at all and I had just made an appointment an hour prior. The dental assistant that whitened my teeth was very informative and I can tell was a perfectionist (which I appreciate) when she set me up to whiten my teeth. I walked back out to the front where the front desk lady informed me of a contest they were running on social media. I felt like they care about their patients. And are very engaging and compassionate. Highly recommend<//review>

Who loves to go to the dentist???  But, I will say one thing - going to Dr Marham's office is a good experience - not bad.....my Kelli is special -  very efficient - knowledgeable - she multi-tasks - which makes her exceptional.....and, to have a good looking dentist like Dr Markham -  is always a plus....

So, I would say that you get 5-stars - in all categories.

See ya in July, Kelli.

< Review>
Dr Markham and his staff are just a God Send. I had a huge phobia of the dentist and even the smell of the office would set me into a panic mode and many times before I would pass out from just the stress of it all . Dr Markham and his staff are so gentle and patient and alleviated and put to rest years of anxiety and fear in the very first visit . I no longer fear going and actually look forward to going and seeing everyone there . I have major dental needs and they all have been pain and anxiety free !!  I hold a very special place in my heart for Dr Steve Markham and his staff and will be always forever grateful for them and the help they gave me in bringing my smile back . Thank you so very much.<//Review>

I started receiving care form Dr. Markham about 8 years ago and really liked him.  A few years back he doubled his office size and I immediately began to see a decline in the quality of care my family and I were receiving.  There were multiple staff changes during this time as well.  Things really got bad a year ago when we put my daughter in braces.  Because the doctor had become so busy, most of the work was done by his assistant.  She always seemed to be in a hurry and her work was rarely checked by Dr. Markham.  This resulted in many return trips to his office to have procedures repaired or redone completely.  Brackets and wires would constantly come undone, sometimes within hours of leaving the office.  The final straw was the arrival of his new receptionist, Heather.  Billing became a joke and we suddenly had balances due for procedures that had been paid for in the past, as far back as 2 and half years in one instance.  Her attitude became condescending when we questioned why these balances had not been brought to our attention sooner.  To add to my frustration, my family and I recently began seeing a new dentist and found that procedures done within the last 6 months by Dr. Markham and his staff have to be repaired or completely redone, resulting in an added expense.  I still, after 8 years of continuous business, have not received even a text from Dr. Markham to address any of my concerns.  What a shame, 8 years ago this would have been a five star review.<//Text>

I love Dr. Markham and his staff. The atmosphere is amazingly friendly. Everyone is so concerned about your comfort. Dr. Marham is an excellent dentist and so friendly. It's the best experience I've ever had in a dental office and I'm old so I've been around. Lol< /text>

< review>
I LOVE this place! Everyone is very personable, they don't try to sell you services you don't need. I've been getting Lazer cleanings at previous dental office every 3 months (ins. Doesn't cover)  because I was told I needed them. I had a cleaning today, Lazer not necessary, once a year is good! The office text me for my bday! and as reminder for apts. They are friends, not just service providers. Make the change, you will not regret it!< /review>

Went in with a cracked bridge and in a lot of pain and, as usual, Dr. Markham and his staff fixed me up. I'm now pain free!< /Text>

I had a consultation for venners, I have never liked the dentist because let's face it it's costly when yout don't have insurance. But I was able to leave happy and knowing I wouldn't be breaking my pocket book for a smile I have always dreamed to have. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for a new dentist or a 2nd opinion on work needed to be done.</text>

The staff is so warm and friendly. They don’t push products on you and they don’t make you feel bad about having cavity prone teeth or gum disease.</Review>
