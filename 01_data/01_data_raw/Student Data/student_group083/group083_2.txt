First time visit. This store is phenomenal. Due to covid restrictions we had a little bit of a wait, which I normally wouldn't do, but I'd heard good things about the place from friends. They have an amazing selection (cheese, salami, beer, wine, etc.) despite being a relatively small space. I came for one thing, which unfortunately they didn't have at the moment due to import shortages (not their fault), but I left with a plethora of goodies. I'll definitely be back next time I'm in town.</text>

Holy cow! What an amazing shop! We landed and were crazy hungry. So we did exactly what you shouldn't do and went in hungry. They have a great selection of wines that run across all varieties. Their cheese and meats are equally varied and wonderful. Best of all, the entire staff knows their products backwards and forwards. We ordered two sandwiches to go. Had we known that each one has roughly the dimensions of a skateboard, we probably could've split one. No matter though—it was delicious.< /review>

What an amazing placed filled with amazing people! We were just in Palm Springs for a week, and we entertained friends at our home multiple times throughout our stay there, and On the Mark was our reliable source for everything but mostly their beautiful charcuterie spreads. They are kind, helpful, knowledgable, and their ingredients are so fresh that we returned 4 of our 7 nights for dinner ingredients, etc. This is exactly what our little city needed, and they were so sweet to accommodate us with a one hour notice for a spread. I can't recommend this place more, and look forward to hosting more of their goodies!< /text>

Loved their variety of artisanal cheeses and meats.  Had their veggie/cheese sandwich and the fig spread was super yummy!  My friend and I were staying nearby and got a charcuterie plate.  Best idea ever.  Super delicious!!</Review>

A great place to pick up new sauces or specialty items. You can have them assemble a great meat and cheese plate.
They have a great wine selection and craft beers.<//Review>

<text>I needed a gift basket for some friends vacationing in Palm Springs. Ryan worked on putting together the perfect basket for us. He paired wines, cheeses, meats and so much more. He was a great help and truly went above and beyond making sure it got delivered to the right house.

<Rating>3< /Rating><Review>A lovely little store of unusual finds and goodies right in downtown  Palm Springs. We were welcomed heartily and given plenty of time and space to explore their store. We've heard from friends that their hand-crafted sandwiches and such are outstanding, but will have to try them another time. Keep in mind, with special items that are often hard to find there are also some rather 'salty' prices. A fun place to explore and you may find that unique addition to your epicurean delights!< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x80db1bb84cea1625:0xc77162eff335e2ad< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Incredible hole on the wall here. Their catering is incredible but also come in to grab a delicious sandwich and try various very delicious cheeses, spread, mustards etc.

ALSO: TRY THEIR EXOTIC CHOCALATES!! Batch specific, curated chocolates... unbelievable

Their sandwiches use bread baked that am which really compliment the extreme quality ingredients they use to build your sandwich. I had the Wisconsin on fresh baked, moist sour dough with amazing carmelized dark crust... must try, the cheese and meats are out of this world!
As far as catering goes, the presentation is on a board that shows extremely well and of course the foods are on a completely nother level... TRY IT!</Review>

Great place for gifts of a foodie nature. The new store is full of little discoveries. We bought two sandwiches for our flight home. $12.95 for a sandwich and salad or chips. The sandwiches had Grade A ingredients were tasty and in typical American style, huge, not necessarily in size but in filling ingredients. I would say for those who have a light appetite, share a sandwich. Service is great, staff are very helpful. I saw some beautiful charcuterie boards in the fridge. This is just a great place. Well done!</review>

There were lots of nice cheeses we havent tried (bought a few for when we go back to LA tomorrow) and some meats, along with some other jarred delicacies. We ended up getting some sandwiches for dinner—the Italian meats one and the turkey (cant remember the names). They were OUTSTANDING! Generous and delicious! *Big plus* was having gluten free bread that held together when I bit into the sandwich and tasted like non-gf bread. What a find! Ate it too fast to take pictures, unfortunately! lol! Friendly, knowledgeable staff, too. This is definitely on our “regular eats” list when we come for our visits. Thank you!! See you soon!</text>< pics>

Cutest little shop with great selection of wines and cheeses. The owner is so amiable and helpful. Deli on site where they will help create a lovely, delicious picnic or cheese board.< /text>

Love this place have been going for the last three years on our visit to Palm Springs we had a hard time finding it this year as it moved hope Google update there map so you can find it it's actually on museum way and not on the main strip even though the address suggest that sandwiches and salads are excellent as well<//Review>

Always new delicious things to sample, many things not available anywhere else in the desert. The gourmet cheese platters and deli sandwiches are incredible.  Don't drive by, give it a try.

This place is the one I always prefer. I go to plenty of restaurants but here I go the most. The crew is very cordial and the cuisine they serve is so delicious. I never decline to have a good dinner in this restaurant. I recommend this place with pleasure.< /text>

They have a lot of problems.  Their website doesn't work half the time, neither does their other computer systems.  Was supposed to be awarded points that would have earned me a free pizza, but their system screwed up and the store manager wouldn't fix it.  Messages to corporate have gone unanswered for weeks.  Don't waste your money here, they don't care about you!  Left 1 star because I can't leave zero.</text>

First I like to start with thank you so much for staying open during pandemic. By far this is the most hygiene restaurant I have ever seen. Thank you for keeping up with current CDC policies and regulations and serving Town of Windsor.< /Review>

The pizza was completely dry with almost no cheese on toppings and looks like they are saving the cheese and just put tomato sauce!!!

How much cheese should be in pizza??
Please make it perfect.<//review>

No restroom, no tables big enough for a pizza box and more than one or two people.  We give the pizza 4 stars without regard to the restaurant set up. Good for take out.<//Text>

After the pandemic hit, I had to edit my review.

No one here wears a mask/face guard, no one wears gloves, employees are expected to work sick.  Whatever food you eat was handled by hand at some point, and odds are they weren't washed either.

This place is a high infection risk.< /review>

I order take out and delivery all the time from here. Order your takeout online and get a free pint of ice cream or 2 liter when you pick up! Also any order placed online for $20 or more is eligible for free garlic cheesy bread, just locate the offer in the specials section of the webpage when doing your online order.  This can also be combined with other online specials.

Only con about this place is the bbq sauce can't be used as a base sauce because it burns too easily. I've found that the garlic white sauce as a base sauce with bbq sauce as an extra sauce compliments it perfectly!</Text>

Top notch service! Georgia and her team are amazing. They respond instantly and always help out when needed. I would highly recommend to anyone who needs their service. They dealt with Gophers, Moles, Squirrels, Rodents and Crickets control around our property. Highly professional and very amicable.<//Review>

<text>Among Fires, Covid etc -- Gophers were destroying my yard.  And yes, I had baskets.  I was about to give up when I discovered a beautiful yard in my neighborhood that was flourishing.  Their secret -- Got Gophers.  Georgia answered my call professionally and set the tone for a great experience.  Mags and Juan  are the fierce Gopher Hunters.  They get the job done.  I have referred 3 friends.  All who have sent me success photos.  Thanks to Got Gophers?  in this trying time, I can at least enjoy my yard again.<//text>< user_id>

<review>Saw their service truck on our street. Asked my neighbor about them and called. Great, friendly, professional service. They scheduled a visit. They Inspected the property, identified problem areas and helped to clear. It was a big headache for last 2.5 years. I guess I was too friendly to gophers but they turned the yard upside down. No more! Thanks guys. Especially you Miguel. You are very kind and knowledgeable. Highly recommend.<//review>< pics>

Danny and Alfredo have been servicing our house for a few weeks and they are amazing! I’m in the customer service field and these guys exceed my tough expectations for what great service is! They explain what they plan on doing and communicate well on when they will be coming to service. If you’re not home, they leave a note detailing what they did and if they found any activity. Georgia and her team have a great thing going!! Keep it up Got Gophers!!!<//Review>

Georgia and her team is excellent. After trying to work with so many gopher control businesses, where we didn't see the results, Georgia responded immediately to the call and Miguel came by to set up the traps. They have caught multiple gophers who were ruining our lawn and finally our lawn looks healthy. Her team is very proactive, and cares deeply for the customer. They truly want to help as opposed to multiple other businesses who are in it for just making money. I highly recommend them.</review>

I highly recommend Got Gophers to anyone how has these little yard wreckers and or molls.
Georgia and Miguel were prompted, professionals who serviced my yard 1 day after I called and rid me of my problem the on the 1st visit.
I had been using another service and was getting the run around.
I can’t say enough how happy they made me!
Regards.
Dave.<//review>

Got Gophers did a mediocre job with addressing rodent issues for us. They did delay my ability to actually deal with my gopher issue with never returning after the first date and missed follow ups. My yard was a nightmare. None of their actions helped and eventually led to an unstable yard. Go with a better vendor if you actually want to address your gopher problem.<//Review>

<review>After having not much success with other places, I called “Got Gophers” and was happy someone picked up the call😄. Georgia explained the process. Miguel came by and setup the traps. After couple of weeks, they caught a mole. He came back again to follow up and make sure there were no more moles. Great service.<//review>< pictures>

We had rats under our house and needed to get our crawl space cleaned and disinfected. I requested a quote and heard back almost immediately! Really happy with the customer service and with Miguel, who came to the house. Friendly, hard working and showed up right on time; did a great job. Thanks Got Gophers! Would definitely use them again.< /text>

I’ve had excellent service & results with
Got Gophers. Great pricing compared to competitor. I’ve had gophers, moles & voles.
I wish I had called them sooner. I tried the natural methods online with little success.
I live in a wooded area so have the monthly service. Highly recommend!< /Review>

Magdaleno and Juan have been servicing our property in Santa Cruz for over two years now. We were unable to successfully trap gophers ourselves and had much destruction. Since they’ve been on board we haven’t lost any plants. They are courteous people and skillful trappers, we couldn’t be happier with them and Got Gophers.<//Review>

So relieved to have found Got Gophers -- they've been amazing at keeping critters at bay here! Magdaleno has been servicing our yard in Santa Cruz the past few months and he's great. He's super knowledgable and strategic about where he places traps and why. Georgia, the owner, walked me through all the options for service ahead of time, and really got us set up right. She was so easy to work with.  We're so glad we now have Got Gophers on our homecare team! Phew!< /text>

<review>Got Gophers is the best!  We’ve never had any mole issues on our property for years until this past October when some moles have been tunneling underground into our property (under the fence) from the neighbors’ side.  Got gophers’ team came promptly to our home to provide a quote and a consultation.  Victor laid out the traps, and within less than a week and a half, 3 moles were caught.  We are extremely happy with their service and decided to stick with them for the next few months.  We aren’t sure what our neighbors are doing to control their mole problems in Burlingame Park, but Got Gophers gets the job done right and quickly!  They are trustworthy and dependable.  They have many years of experience.  They’re the right team for your pest control.< /review>< pictures>

Javier was excellent! Responded immediately. Set traps intelligently. Followed up a week later. Caught one mole, which he buried.

Javier said they’re probably weren’t more moles. Just in case, he set more traps. Checked traps today. No more moles.

If I ever see signs of more mole activity, you can be sure I’ll call Javier. Got Gophers does the job quickly and professionally.</text>

Excellent team, especially Miguel, who set up traps and caught a few smart gophers from my front yard. Those gophers didn’t leave any holes but eating my plants silently. I would recommend this team to any of my friends.</Review>

Miguel came out and got rid of all the rats, cleaned up their mess and sealed up and replaced a few broken vents where they were getting in.

Miguel was fantastic. He came out and set traps as  our back yard had been trashed by moles and no one else could resolve the issue. Miguel knew exactly where to place the traps and he did so keeping our dogs in mind. I had worried that they might try and get into the traps. Miguel showed me exactly where he places them which is deep and also covered with cones so there is no way our dogs could get into the traps and get hurt. Miguel came back in a couple days and had caught 2 moles. If they come back, we will definitely call Miguel. Excellent service.</review>

<text>I may be calling these guys in the future since my flower garden became a magnet for gophers and moles. I lost 34 plants waiting on the other guys to return calls, and the trapper who offered to help me had a long waiting list ahead of me.

I sent a text to Got Gophers after business hours on Friday requesting their help. I didn’t expect a call until Monday, but they were texting back within the hour. Hector came to set traps on Monday and 3 weeks later I can say, ‘this house is clean.’

Many thanks for the excellent customer service by Hector, the mystery person that texted me on Friday night, and the entire Got Gophers team!<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

Best in the business. I had used another service that was much more expensive, and I’m happy I switched. Georgia, Juan, Mag and team are great and super easy to work with. They’ve pulled about 20 gophers and moles out of our yard in the last few months.

I like that they have a monthly option instead of a “per gopher” option. Saves me a ton of money. Highly recommend. Good luck with your gophers..</Review>

We are thrilled GotGopher  caught one gopher and one mole after installing the first bunch of traps!

Georgia is super efficient  in coordinating trappers responding to clients reported incidents. I’m very happy to have GotGopher to care for our yard!<//review>

<text>Highly recommend the Tandoori Mixed Grill (which is not on the menu) and the garlic naan. I would give this place 5 stars, however, their curries are lacking flavor and spices.

Ask for Alex when you arrive. He is friendly and always has some great recommendations on what to try.</text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPc5CrgynAbCzSGdllyHq1kILb-w-gI_7YzGT6S=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< response>

Had been here for evening drinks and snacks which was good. Came back for buffet. Food selection is decent, not much different from any other bay area Indian buffet at this price point. 4 stars because some of the food items were not warm even though we arrived by noon.

Updates from 10/08/2019: changed the rating to 5 star. Visited this place again for evening drinks and family dinner. Great food (I would let pictures do the justice) and enjoyed the service. Will definitely come again for this experience. It does seem like evening menu based food/service is different (much better) than other forms like lunch buffet.< /Text>

Great ambience. Good selection of items during lunch buffet such as biryani, fruit, chai, butter chicken, idli, pakoras. If you're a fan of chutney their tomato and mint is very thick and flavorful.< /review>

Came for lunch with a large group, and everyone enjoyed the food at the lunch buffet. Good selection of vegetable dishes and meat plus salads. All the typical dishes: paneer, daal, tandoori chicken and tikka masala. Plus others I don't recall but very good. Fresh naan delivered to the table. They are good at bringing more water since some dishes are spicy. None are incredibly spicy but there's many sauces you can add. They had two desserts: shredded carrot cake and cafe mousse. After Yelp check in it was only around $10 per person before taxes and tip! Great deal and good quality. Not too crowded.

Definitely recommending and coming back!< /text>

We finally made it over to try the new Urban Spice restaurant and really loved every single dish. Some were a little spicey, but we are total babies when it comes to spice. The waitress brought some cucumber yogurt to put on top, which helped with the spice and made the dishes even better. You have to try the date naan, it's not even on the menu yet, but it is the best! Also, I recommend asking for some chutney if you order the pesto paneer. And of course the chicken Tikka masala was on point!<//Text>

Food was not served till 12.30 when party start time was 11.30. The manager told us at 2.45 PM to end the party at 3PM. The next party was already allowed to enter before we wrapped up our party and kept pushing to take our stuff and clear the area ASAP. The beginning and end of the party was a chaos. Expected more coordination from the mgmt.<//Text>< pics>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>We ate at the buffet & loved it! I am not familiar with a lot of different styles of Indian cuisine & I am gluten intolerant. I was impressed with the chef, who came out of the kitchen to go over the menu with me, when I was at the front counter, inquiring about the g f. options. After entering the restaurant, & seeing the extensive buffet, I hesitantly asked about the g f. options. Again, the chef came out of the kitchen, went around the buffet to each option. He was kind, and very helpful. Later, another person explained the sauces & what foods were best with each.... without my even asking. We thoroughly enjoyed the food, and the opportunity to try different foods. We enjoyed the open, friendly attitude of the staff. The price was very reasonable. We will be back!< /Text></record>

Still a new place so hopefully a chance to improve. Very chill and casual. Had a few drinks at the bar and chopped it up with the bartender. Nice guy. Looks new, but very personable. Just a tad too cold in the room as well. Hoping for music for atmosphere, or sound from the bar TV. Will definitely be coming back.</Text>

<review>Went there on Sunday around 1 for lunch buffet and it was crowded. Had to wait for 2o minutes to get the table.
I thought the food was just okay. Most of the items were almost finished when I got there and nobody was filling the containers with the hot food. Little bit disappointed by that. I can understand the crowd makes it harder to manage but this is something very basic.
I did not feel like taking more food on the plate since I was just going to scrape the last bites of everything.
I will have to come here again to see if anything changes otherwise that will be it.
Food itself was decent but not extraordinary than any other buffet.</review>< pictures>

<review>Amazing food. Stop by for Sunday lunch buffet and found worth it. We start with some appetizer veg - Chinese noodles, cut mirchi, veg manchurian and non-veg tandoori, lamb cutlet. The cut mirchi was so crispy and juicy that i can tell on the spot that it would be fresh and just served for buffet. Same experience with tandoori. I hv never tested this soft and well marinated tandoori. It melted in my mouth. Nan was so good, 3 of us ordered 4+. Service is also good. Even after kitchen closed they served one extra nan with no extra charge. To visit again they gave us 15% coupon. Restaurant was clean and got parking.
Will definitely visit again<//review>< Pictures>

<text>This lounge is in the same building as Urban spice. We went to have some casual drinks and snacks. We shared the lamb sliders and garlic fries. Food was aromatic and tasted good but with an Indian interpretation of sliders and garlic fries. They had craft beer and wide liquor selection. I had a pint of shadow puppet's Hazy ipa and an old fashioned.
Bar tender was great an even asked if we wanted a certain music player to be most hospitable.</text>< pics>

Enjoyed the buffet. Reasonable spread of items, not super extravagant like some other places. Fresh naan was brought to the table. Water was refilled and empty plates removed regularly.</review>

<Rate>1</Rate><Text>Writing this while we starve. It's not just food, we don't even have water here anymore. Thankfully we reserved the table so there was a bottle of water at the start. Hoping for a refill sometime. Maybe it's the effect of the drought. Hopefully they will send us some food soon. Fingers crossed.

Update: Seems like some of othe orders placed half hour back did not reach the kitchen. Kitchen is closed. They are finding "something" for us to eat.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

I tried the buffet at this place. Liked the food very much. Indian style naan is served in the place. And you can request for hot and fresh  naan to the table directly. Very friendly staff and Kid friendly environment. Will be back here for dinner.<//review>

<text>Very bad service. Totally unorganized for large group. They made us sit in the bar area for food, but just one server in the whole area. Food delivery was really really really slow. We literally had to struggle to get food on table. After ordering the food the waiter came back after 20 mins and said the kitchen is closed. That's pathetic service. I mean seriously???
Never gonna come back here again. Whatever they served us wasn't that great either. Just an ordinary testing food. I dont recommend this place for group bigger than 7-8 people.< /text>< Pics>

<Text>I'm honestly not the one to give bad reviews and try my best to air on the side of giving positive reviews but this one I just have to say it as it is for the sake of others.

Customer Service/Ambience:
The customer service was good and everyone was nice, the ambience was good as well except it was freezing in the restaurent and even though when I did notify the waiter and the waiter did turn it up a bit (which Haha he hilariously turned it up to 58 degree, I could see it cuz I was sitting right across from the thermostat, I was like whaaat how cold was it before then) but even after that it was still terrible. At one point me we had to stop eating cuz our hands were really cold especially since we were eating with our hands.

Food:
Now the food, I really liked the menu and was really optimistic it would be good. We ordered 3 items 1 appetizer chicken, 1 entreé chicken and 2 biryanis chicken/goat. The food came out quick and on time.  The moment I took the first bite from each of this dishes it had a strong poultury taste and chicken was undercooked and that really killed my entire experience. And the goat was chewy and not well cooked either. The foods sauce and gravy was good but with the meat being this bad for all 4 dishes  it became a really unpleasent experience, then you add to that the freezing temperature at the restaurent.. just > :(
I even had an stomach ache that night. I'm sorry but I would never be coming back to this restaurant.< /Text>< Pics>

I had such a horrendous experience here. I was getting the food while talking to my wife on the phone. The supervisor told me to leave the station as I am not allowed to talk while getting the food. This is ABSURD !! I am never going back again. I wish I could give ZERO star to this place.<//review>

Never gonna come back here again. Whatever they served us wasn't that great either. Just an ordinary testing food. I dont recommend this place for any one... You will get nothing to eat even after waiting for couple of hours.

Awesome place! The food was great we ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala and they ask you how spicy do you want it, we asked for mild it was just right. We also ordered the Chicken Biryani and it was amazing. The bar next door is also a nice place to hangout and the drinks are priced reasonably.<//review>

<Review>Food : We ordered Kadhai Paneer, Dal Makhani and garlic naan.Kadhai Paneer and Dal Makhani were cold and stale.
Felt like it's been in refrigerator for couple of days.

Ambience: Ambience is nice but Restaurant was super cold.It was very hard for us to sit there for 30 mins.They turned on the heater when we asked for it but it takes time to heat up the restaurant.

Service: Service was fast because they are serving stale food.

Price: Given the food they serve price is high. $14 for Kadhai Paneer better go to Amber and pay extra $3 for good Kadhai Paneer

Not as expected....i didn't find spicy in any item of all buffet items..and taste also is not sooo good...its like average taste....but 3 ratting is for naans....i never ate such a thin naans which were served on a buffet on Sunday afternoon. Other then naans, I didn't like any items in spicy wise and some in taste wise... including mango laasy...<//text>

<Rating>1</Rating><review>Went on Mother's day Weekend and it's complete Chaos. After waiting for 20 minutes, Almost everything in the buffet is empty. Everyone is waiting for either curry or plate.
Don't recommend to anyone. Nothing was amazing everything remaining is also average.< /review>< Pics>

<text>Just tried this place, it's great! We ordered the Gobi Manchurian and it was delicious! We had it up a level in spice and it was great! Good heat and nice tangy flavors!

We found the house Pinot noir happened to be my favorite wine at home, Mirrassou brand! I think the house cab, is LaPlaya still good too.

We tested the Lamb sliders, they we're good nicely cooked not overdone good mild spiced flavor.

Overall service was great! Our bartender was really nice! Hope this place stays around, it's so nice to have a tastey place right down the street.<//text>< pictures>

<review>(Translated by Google) I liked the food the friendly people the very wide place but it opened buffet and the tablecloths of the buffet were filthy from dirty downstairs they use transparent plastic on the table but from the middle asia down to the floor it was disgusting and that makes it clear the illusion of thinking what else is inside if that is to the bista

(Original)
Me gusto la comida la gente amigable el lugar muy amplio pero abia buffet y los manteles del buffet estaba asquerosos de sucios de abajo ellos usan plástico transparente encima de la mesa pero de la mitad asia abajo al piso estaba asqueroso y eso ase q se t quite la ilusión de pensar q más hay adentro si eso esta a la bista<//review>< Pictures>

Tough place to deliver and pick up from. The truck entrance is marked with a white sign and is the closest to the intersection. It's a tight turn and there are lots of parked cars and pedestrians so WATCH OUT!

Recieving and shipping open up at 7:00am; don't bother getting there early because there is no room for you to sit and wait. They may recommend that you go down the street to park at the cul-de-sac near the dog park but BE CAREFUL: there are cars that park there and your trailer swing could easily hit one.

Shipping is in red and receiving is in green. Follow the blue line to exit.</review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

(Translated by Google) The managers of the 3 shifts remain the same only at their convenience, who likes them very well, the boss of the line treats all bad ones with the new people and the agency is on their side x that they take away the work but the bad thing that they never listen to you only what they design even if the agency rests it, you are only used while you serve them ... all employees are underpaid and pressured

(Original)
Sigue siendo lo mismo los mánagers de los 3 turnos solo a su conveniencia quien les cae bien te tratan bien la jefa de línea todas unas malas con las personas nuevas y la agencia esta del lado de ellos x que le quitan el trabajo pero lo malo que nunca te escuchan solo lo que ellos disen auno la agencia lo descansa solo eres utilizado mientras les sirvas ...mal pagados todos los empleados y presionados</Text>

These people act as if they're doing you a favor by spending your money on them....if anything, they should be thankful that we shop there... Lousy service and with an attitude...plus false advertising on their hours<//Review>

The owner and staff are very friendly. After they have gotten to know you they know what you want and my Pepsi are on the counter ready to go. They are also. Very accommodating when handicap peopLe come to the store. They will get everything you need with a smile.< /Text>

<Text>We had three pies and a Salad  delivered to us.
The pizza was thin crust and crispy.  The salad was fresh.  The delivery was in the estimated window of   time. The pies are pricey for the size. I do feel they use quality ingredients. I will order again, every one did enjoy dinner.</Text>< pics>

We're here last night with my friends for we're craving pizza. When it was served on the table, I tasted it immediately. It was a really fantastic pizza and pasta with organic flour and top quality ingredients. I would come back to this restaurant again with my family. Highly recommended place for everyone who loved pasta or pizza.<//text>

<Text>Really good, fresh ingredient pizza. I frequently order Papa John's Pizza via Uber Eats, and haven't had any bad experiences that were within Papa John's Pizza control (cold pizza, long delivery times quite often). I wish they offered chicken instead of pepperoni but their cheese pizza is fantastic. This is the best small/semi-affordable delivery pizza in SF that i've had.</Text>< Rating>

I order pizza all the time from a lot of places for my son.. Ana and her team made this actually the best place.  I am beyond grateful for their dedication to customer service.
I will order from them continually once this is over.

Thank you all for being there working...I am grateful for all of you.<//review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

This place deserves more hype!! We ordered the Sweet & Spicy Wings, Lemon Pepper Wings, Large Brisket/Buffalo Chicken Pizza and a Large Asada/Lebanese Pizza! The cashier was extremely nice and kept apologizing for the wait but it was honestly so worth it. They offer additional sauces on the side for free!
Also don't forget to check in on yelp for a free drink!! :)<//Text>

Never disappoints with a fire late night pizza. Also get the truffle butter. You can never go wrong with truffle butter and this is the place to customize you're pizza to your liking I love to get the truffle butta with some mozzzz broccoli and sundries tomatoes
Ask for it well done
Get a side of fresh garlic and Parmesan
You can go all out with the red crushed pepper but I'm a White boy and I don't have those taste buds but by all means.  Enjoy<//Text>

I would have given 4 stars because I appreciate good service and good prices, and they have very good deals, but pizza is not my favorite comfort food and I had already ate. All in all. Worth it.<//Review>

Inefficient, don't care about the customer. I placed an order and my husband had to drive during the pandemic to find out the order was never submitted by the employee. Waste of time and lack of care for their customers!!!</text>

In this city you have a very big competition! You must be better! Delicious pizza, but small selection. More staff and tables too!</text>

<Text>Horrible, old pizza.  I ended up tossing most of it.

Easy ordering online for pickup of $6 Med 1 topping.  Little Caeser's has been better and includes a free 2 Liter.

Location:  Dirty sidewalks but cleaner than parts of San Francisco and Downtown Hollyweird.  Parking sucks, as usual.  I had to park my car first and walk back via Google Maps to actually find it.  It right on the corner, and I was driving down the hill.  Better signage needed.< /Text>< name>

We live decently close to this place and have ordered from here on a.couple of occasions. It usually takes 45 minutes and the pizza arrives cold. I much prefer to make my own pizza. It taste better and is probably healthier.< /text>< gmapID>

If i could give this papa johns no stars, I would. They have the worst customer service. We ordered pizza for my office lunch and they forgot part of our order. We called immediately to let them know and they said the rest of our order would be delivered asap. An hour passed, nothing. I called once more asking where our order was and they said the driver was 5 minutes away, and we asked if they could accomadate a refund because we were feeding alot of people and they said no, and that our driver was almost there. Another hour and a half passed. I called to get a refund and it was the most complicated process, on top of that, the manager (who didn`t state her name) was being rude.< /review>

<review>I'm picky about my pizza (what Los Angeles isn't, though?) and have been wanting to try Papa John's Pizza for awhile. It did not disappoint! I was surprised my family and I were seated so quickly given that it was prime dinner hour but that could be due to the fact that it was a week night. The pizza was really good and the waiter we had was very accommodating- my aunt has celiac's so he helped her piece together a meal out of sides and pizza toppings that she was able to eat. Very glad we went here!< /review>< Date>

<Text>I haven't had this pizza for years but I decided to try it again. It's still the same gland crust that's dry. I don't really like the sauce either. The employee was nice when I picked up the pizza so I am giving them an extra star for that.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<text>An online order was placed for a pizza to be picked up at 7:15 p.m.  I arrived at 7:15 p.m. and it was ready.  I asked for a couple of plates and they were given to me.  I had no problem with the order.  Sure, I could complain that I had to stand in line behind three people who were there before me - but that would be kinda stupid.

Although, there was an incident that as a customer you don't want to see/hear, because such things leave a bad impression.  As I entered PJP, a lady who was already picking up her order requested napkins; the worker looked for some and I guess couldn't find any.  So, he asked the manager, who was pressing dough if there were any more napkins.  The manager, replied quite rudely that he did not have any, shrugging his shoulders as if he didn't care how this might affect customer relations.  The lady had a quizzical look.  I too wondered, how could you have no napkins - you're a restaurant.  The worker apologetically told the lady that she could go to the restaurant next door to get napkins.</text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80c2c6511da13f91:0x68c75ff5e90f9a1e< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>Horrible service. I was told it would take 45 minutes and I live close and it is way past 1 hour and they don't answer the phone!! They answered once and hung up on me!! It shouldn't take more than 13 calls just to let me know what is going on. It is so frustrating!!! Just want to know why it is taking so long. When I was giving my address she didn't even let me finish giving my apartment number and said they guy would just call me. Last time I am ever ordering from them!!< /review>< Pictures>

I had ordered two pizzas and they came back to me as if they were smashed and already eaten into. I had asked for them to make me two new ones and when they had returned with the new pies, they ended up having one pie correct...

But the gave me the other pizza incorrectly. Never will I order from this location. Terrible service.</text>

The guy that is taking orders never understands me till someone else gets on the phone with me. I don’t recommend calling or else the guy that always picks up the phone will annoy you by repeating the same questions over and over really disappointed ever since he started to pick up.</Review>

They're rude here! When the Walmart grocery store was open my bf wanted to order 2 medium pizzas. Checking from there prices it's to much and the size difference from a small to a medium is not even a difference at all and yes they charge you alot for it! The guy who was taking our order kept making a weird stare and had a mad and annoyed tone on his voice and wanted us to leave or something. He was unhelpful damn only I knew his name that woulduve been better to rate this place. Whats the downside of this place is Papa John's Pizza overcharges you for 2 medium pizzas and a 2 litter soda here ended up to be $30!? Man that's way to much and to top it off there pizza isn't  good yes I tried many pizza's  in my life the pizza here is the far worst that I had. Might as well order domino's for 2 medium pizzas and a 2 litter soda is just around $19 so support Domino's Pizza you get a better deal and you'll enjoy it a thousand times much better than Papa John's.</review>

Terrible service. Ordered a pizza, it had no taste so we called and complained, the lady promised a free credit for the exact (custom XL) pizza at a future date since we didnt want another one that same night; and all i would have to do is give my phone number. I did that and called 2 days later, the manager said they couldnt find anything in the system so the best they could do is give one topping. Bullshit. He was very rude and when i put my husband onthe phone he then started to haggle and offer smaller size pizzas with one more topping. Even though i ordered a $30 pizza. Thanks for the helpful customer service.</review>

to Papa John,
It's sad to know that even when I live under 2 miles from this location they "can't" deliver to me. I will never enjoy another "Papa Johns" pizza. I'm very stubborn and will hold a grudge till I die!

<Review>Today I ordered a pizza & paid $31 plus tip & when I opened it, it was burned. Eventually I did not eat it and I called Papa Johns quick and explained to them the situation & they ignored it. I was told another pizza would come but nothing came. I called one last time and they didn't answer. Not sure I will ever order a pizza from there ever again.<//Review>< Pics>

Slow, made mistakes with my order, bad pizza and really expensive for what it is. Being from Kentucky, I grew up on this stuff, but even nostalgia cannot save it.
For the same price you can go to a real pizzeria.  Never again Papa John's, never again.<//Review>

< review>
I've been going here for several years now. I was originally referred here by 1800Dentist. I can't say enough good things about the staff and office. The entire staff is very attentive and accommodating. So far I've had 3 crowns completed and multiples cleanings. All my experiences have been positive with good results. I honestly feel that my dental health is the best it has been my entire life and I definitely owe it to Pearl Dental. I highly recommend them.< /review>

Best hygienist ever! She is what makes my visit excellent. She is so gentle yet thorough and thoughtful all at once. Everyone is really nice and sweet but Cristina makes me always want to return 😉< /Review>

Had my teeth cleaned yesterday at Pearl Dental it was painless yet thorough
The dental assistant does it the traditional way with dental tools, I will continue to go to Pearl Dental for all my dental needs
I believe the dental assistant’s name was Brianna she was excellent<//review>

Where has this Dentist been my whole life. From the most friendly receptionist, Gloria, to the extremely detailed technicians...they are all Great!
But, number one, is the the man with the gentle hands, Dr Camacho. I would recommend his hands to everyone. I am afraid of dentists... but NOT WITH HIM!
Thank you to the entire team at Pearl Dental!!< /Review>

Outstanding service by true professionals and a top-level facility, with digital imaging and great follow-up.
They helped me with dental onlay and tooth implant; perfect fit both times!  My check-ups are regular, thanks to email/text notifications.
Staff is awesome and Dentists are very experienced and careful when doing the work.
Love them!

Pearl Dental Group is the best place for your routine dental care! The staff is phenomenal! They are fast, friendly, and professional. They know your name when you come back and they always make you feel at home. The doctors are wonderful at answering any questions you have and taking the time to explain conditions, services and treatments.
Gloria... Dr. Sara... you ROCK!
I wouldn’t go anywhere else! Highly, highly recommended!</Text>

She pulls up a stool and visits about what is going on in your life- before beginning the scheduled procedure. The rooms have lighted panels on the ceilings- with pictures of the outdoors that lend the rooms an airy feel. In this Pearl Dental office, the rooms are situated in a circle around a central open space. When you are waiting, there is  companionable activity going on around you.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

I have been a client of Dr. Trilles for over eight years. He came highly recommended from my sister-in-law and several others from my daughters private school in Glendora.

I have never experienced such a positive dental visit or a dentist as trustworthy, approachable, knowledgeable, well experienced and hands on as Dr. Erwin Trilles.  Not only does he have the fastest dental hands in the west ... he will NOT bombard you with a laundry list of unnecessary dental work to inflate costs.

At every visit I feel like a VIP client. I am greeted (by name) the moment I walk-in the office by the extraordinary, ray-of-sunshine, Gloria. The waiting room is decorated with cool calming and stylish decor ... and my favorite part - The Coffee Bar!

They are so efficient with scheduling ... by the time my coffee is brewed, the staff has called me to my dental “suite” (a private room) with a large TV screen and choice of Netflix programming.

This may be the most efficient Dental office and they work well as a team. They have several services from dental work, to teeth whitening to Orthodontic services. They respect your time ... they work swiftly, yet timely and are reasonably priced.

In emergency cases or when in need of troubleshooting ... they have worked with me to resolve the problem with ease.

If Dr. Trilles moves to the other side of the moon  ... I can ensure you ... I will follow him there! By far the best Dentist I’ve worked with!< /review>

<Review>Just finished taking the whole family for a check up & this place is amazing. We do a 22 mile drive and we wouldn’t go anywhere else. From friendly staff to an amazing Doctor. We’ve been coming here for about 3 years and my 6 year old son & 4 year old daughter have never complained about visiting the dentist.
Overall great place to bring the whole family.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

I also appreciate the care provided by Nancy who has cleaned my teeth many times. Gloria is a pleasure to work with and always provides timely information.

I can't really say I enjoy dental care but Dr. Sara and her staff definitely make the best of a bad situation. I am so thankful for their highly professional skills, patience and kindness.< /review>< userid>

Where to begin... this dental office is simply amazing.  Dr. Sara is so genuine and really looks for your best interest.  The staff is so warm and positive which goes a long way because I grew up hating going to the dentist.  They work very well around my schedule and Catia always goes above and beyond while doing so.  I highly recommend this place if your looking for a great dental office.  Thank you for your hard work.< /Text>

Hello world. It’s very rare to feel comfortable and not nervous at a Dental office but at Pearl Dental Group in La verne, it feels like you are visiting friends. The ladies at Pearl Dental are really amazing and it feels great after being in their care. You need to give them a try and experience the love. I highly recommend them because  it’s amazing and they all lead by example by being professional and they all have great teeth and great smiles.< /review>

<Text>After trying 3 different dentists for a current issue I had, I was given the name of Dr. Sara Shirazi. So glad I went to one more dentist. She really knows her stuff. Took care of the problem another dentist created. Was open and honest about what I needed and even gave me an estimate of costs, far less than what others had quoted.  She and her team then worked with my insurance to verify everything was all set.  Quickly got me in for my appointment. New crowns with bridge that is super comfortable. Even took care of a few small fillings I had. No pressure just helped me resolve the problems very professionally. Highly recommend. I've found my dentist at last.</Text>< pictures>

<user_id>112123332128881772570<//user_id><Text>Okay, so they told me not to say this, but I really enjoyed the way they had their hands in my mouth.

Jokes aside, I think Pearl Dental is the reason I started going to the dentist regularly again. I hadn't gone for years, but when I needed to get my wisdom teeth out, Pearl was the closest place to my work with positive reviews, so I gave them a try. I was satisfied with how painless the process of scheduling and billing was. They even send me text reminders because I like to forget that I have appointments coming up. The wisdom tooth removal was pretty easy as well. I wanted to "steal" one of my molars to keep because it looked cool, so they offered to clean it before I put it in my pocket lol. Since my first visit there, there have been times when I didn't have dental insurance, but they were willing to work with me with the out-of-pocket costs. Oh, and the staff is super friendly! I like that they have conversations with you even though you can't speak while your mouth is open. Don't like to talk? They can be quiet too. I'm going to keep going to Pearl Dental as long as I live in the area. Oh, and Gloria kindly reminded me to leave this review. I kept telling them that I was going to leave one, but I"m so bad about these things.

Anyway, I invite those in the area to try out Pearl Dental. What's the worst that can happen? You get really attached and end up having to move away ;P<//Text>< Gmap_id>

I’ve used the Pearl Dental Group for all of my dental needs for the past two years now.  I live in West Covina and can go to any of the many dentists in the local area, but I choose to drive to the Pearl Dental Group in La Verne. I've found Doctors Sara Shirazi and Ben Reyhani along with their incredible staff to be an outstanding group of professionals who are extremely dedicated in providing the best customer service and dental care possible. After a review of my problems, they set me up with a dental plan that addressed all issues. Their staff worked with my insurance company, to ensure my needs were met under the company's plan, and they assisted me in working out a payment plan for work done out of my pocket. I found their pricing to be within range of what I expected for the services I received and I'm very happy with the end results.  The staff at Pearl takes the extra time to ensure that your personal comfort is met and maintained while under their care. All staff members are extremely friendly and courteous, and treats all patients as family from the minute you walk in to their office. I highly recommend Pearl Dental Group to anyone looking for a full service dental practice with a touch a class. You are not just a patient to these good folks, you are family, which is why I will continue to drive to La Verne for my dental needs.</Review>

<review>I never though I would say I enjoy going to the dentist, but that was before I met the team at Pearl Dental. They are very friendly and accomidating. I have a 3 month old, and they helped take care of her while I was getting my teeth clean. Their concern for my oral health was forefront. I have had a few cavities filled here. One of them broke (I guess I am an aggressive flosser), and the Pearl Dental team had it all fixed up in no time. Definitely a great place to take yourself an dyour family for all your teeth needs.< /review>< pictures>

Dr. Ben it's one of the best Dentists I ever ever seen! Listens to you and keeps asking if you are ok. His assistant Elvi is also super carefull and does a great job assisting Dr. Ben. I defenitely recommend you come in to La Verne Pearl Dentist Group. The recepcionists are also very friendly. Ask for Gloria or Katia.<//Review>

I have copd ( chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) a condition worse that asthma and nearly as bad as emphasema. CDC mandate doesn't require those with my condition to wear face coverings. Even though I've abided by the mandate I'm told I need to call in for curb side pick up for shopping experiences because it's not fair to other guest not because of health risk factors but because I legally don't have to wear a covering and others without a medical disability are required therefore unfair. I'd gladly let someone have my health issue to be allowed to shop like everyone else. but because I build up co2 and my body doesn't exhaul properly I'm at higher risk of being asphyxiated within t a mask let alone wearing a covering and further increasing that risk. Their showing their unfair practices by denying service not by me not abiding by the mandate because I am l, but by their right to refuse service because it's unfair not for others healths as I am told on store entrance. This b.s.</text>

<review>My boyfriend only came in to get one thing and this Hispanic female working there decided to be rude and said she didn’t know what he was talking about and didn’t want to help him either with an attitude after he explained what he needed. And why would someone work there if they don’t know what the person needs.< /review>< Rating>

<review>Has products on hand, if they don't they will order it and try to get it delivered that day if not the following day. Helpfully staff. Always check to make sure your parts are in tip top shape. I did receive break pads that were bent because they were not wrapped.</review>< pics>

This place was no help once so ever. I go to get a rental tool that I was told was on hand over the phone.  when i come in and ask about it to the girl at the counter she gave me a "menu" stating that she is bad with tools and parts and that if it's not there they don't have it. Me not knowing what the tool looks like says no I was told you have it in stock I just called and they said the part is around 30, then the girl said they don't carry the part cus it's a special order part. That's when I start getting irritated. I ask for a manager another woman comes  out and tells me the same thing. Now I know there are plenty of women out there that know about cars, my only question is why dosnt this autozone hire them? I feel like who ever hires people at this autozone only hires them cus of there "prominent features"

All in all this autozone needs to start hiring more people with automotive experience. Not just women with nice body's. Poor service but great prices and front what I see it's a clean environment with pretty much everything you need. Parts on hand and 8m sure if they didn't they would order it.
Just don't expect to get any real help with those parts you seek atleast not at this location
Between great and worthless I give them a worthless.

On top of all this I looked online and seen that they have the tool, in stock

< Review>
I was searching for a good deal on auto insurance and my friend suggested getting a quote from GEICO. I called and received amazing customer service from my agent Jacqueline. She was friendly, kind and not pushy like most insurance agents who try to sell a product. The process was quick and simple, and I was driving with my new insurance the same day I called. I highly recommend calling GEICO and ask to speak to Jacqueline.<//Review>

<text>If you're looking for a competitive rate, with awesome customer service,  you Have to check out WILLIAM VELASQUEZ at the Torrance Geico office. He took care of my insurance needs, was friendly, professional, and mindful of every aspect of this process. Better coverage than what I had previous, and lower monthly payments.You Won't regret it. Thanks again William.</text>< pics>

<review>Andrei T was awesome and took the time needed to give us a detailed quote for home and auto. He explained the various options and we felt valued as customers.  My mom is a former Geico policyholder (she no longer drives) and she always raved about their service and support when she needed to file a claim or get other help.< /review>< user_name>

<Text>Johnny Lopez was very easy to work with when picking out my new policy. He is very knowledgeable and helpful every time I call with a question or want to change my policies, pay a bill or need clarification.

I would HIGHLY recommend his services to anyone looking to purchase auto insurance from Geico at an affordable rate.<//Text>< pics>

<text>Johnny Lopez is the best! He was super helpful in finding me a great policy at the price I could afford! I was a little hesitant going with Geico, but he reassured me of my doubts and after 6 months on my policy I can honestly say that I’ll be sticking with them! Johnny was kind, sincere and worked hard and fast. If you want a genuine experience you gotta go see Johnny Lopez!<//text>< pics>

<text>Was in search of new insurance as my rates with my current carrier had gone up. I initially had no intentions of buying geico, was just really seeing what options were out there so I figured I would give this office a ring and check them out.  However dealing with the rep Johnny Lopez was such a great experience, he was able to convince me to go with geico. Not only was he able to get me a better rate, but he provided me with such excellent customer service, it was hard for me to refuse. Thank you Johnny for making my experience an enjoyable one!”< /text>< user_name>

Had to make a payment in person because I couldn't get online to do it. The customer service here was excellent and the response was positive and friendly. I recommend this office if one finds it necessary to pay in person.< /Review>

I called in for a quote and spoke to Daisy Avila. She knows what she is doing she sounded professional, knew what she was talking about, and made the whole process really easy. Anyone who needs a quote or goes visits the office ask for Daisy Avila! I guarantee you will be in GREAT hands. She is licensed and has many years of experience. I know we all would like to discuss our insurance needs to someone who knows what they are doing.</Review>

Had a great experience with Andrei at this location! Really helped me find what the right coverage was for my family and I. Shopped around for quality insurance and he was the difference maker.  I appreciate all the help and will point in his direction should any of my friends or family are looking for coverage.  Thank you Andrei and Geico!< /review>

I wonder if GEICO Insurance is going Bankrupt? I have been Calling for Supplements after Supplements and been promised that they would revise estimate on Claim # 0294298990101046-04. Original Appraiser promised he would resolve this issue. Then we get a call to ask for additional Supplement. Next appraiser said he would take care of it and never got a call back. Few weeks later they state they could not Justify my photos?// But I was promised something else. Been Asking for My rated for the past 7 Years and they keep saying next month or next Estimate. Been like this as long as I remember. Please have somebody contact us about this ongoing issues with your team member. I understand if you don't want to Inspect Vehicle due to Covid 19 but there is not excuse from stealing and under writing Estimate to get a big bonus for your company. That is Wrong....<//Text>

I called twice to cancel my policy. I spoke with Veronica, I told her I was calling to cancel my policy, with no hesitation she said she would transfer me. I was on hold for over 30mins, an agent finally answered and said he doesn’t have the license to cancel my policy because I’m located in California he then transferred me again  but they kept me on hold and then they hung up. I called the office again I explained what happened in which Veronica responded “I can’t help you I’m just a Sales person” and transferred me to the SAME number without letting me talk. Really bad customer service from her part, I can’t speak for the agency as a whole but Veronica, you need to fix your attitude.< /Review>

<Text>Called over 6 insurance places and asked about something called car bond. They either said they don't have it or what is that. I was going to stop there but gave it one more shot and tried this place. Josh picked up the phone and helped me out with no hesitation and got the car bond that I needed badly. Josh right here is the true definition of customer service.</Text>< pictures>

<review>If you're looking for a competitive rate, with awesome customer service,  you Have to check out William Velasquez at the Torrance Geico office. He took care of my insurance needs, was friendly, professional, and mindful of every aspect of this process. I want to thank him for taking care of my family's needs. Better coverage than we had previous, with a discount to start with, and lower monthly payments from there on out. Do yourself a favor if you live in the South Bay, and give him a call.. You Won't regret it. Thanx again William.</review><time>1595463946847<//time>< userid>

<text>If you actually want an insurance company who will pay insurance claims look elsewhere. GEICO has a strict policy of screwing people over. As a general policy, they do not reimburse for work done at certified dealerships. I bought a new car with a warranty and was required to get my repairs done there in order to maintain my warranty. Geico refused to pay for work at the dealership forcing me to choose between paying out of pocket or losing my warranty. Not really sure what the point of insurance is anymore.....<//text>< pictures>

<Review>Please avoid at all cost !!!! Geico doesn’t care about the customer at all they just care about their money, and once you get into an accident they don’t want to cover the damages and blame you for everything and they don’t take accountability for anything. Please do your research and go else where. I got rear ended back in April and I tried to file a claim, but I was denied because apparently I don’t have the coverages. When I first got my insurance 3 years ago I specifically said I wanted full coverage because I have a leased car and I drive with my twins most of the time. This entire time I thought I was properly covered turns out I wasn’t and I been driving without collision coverage. The person who sold me the policy never added collision to my policy now I’m in this big mess where I have to go through the other persons insurance to get my repairs when Geico should up handle the situation better instead of blaming me for not being knowledgeable about my policy. All I wanted to do was pay my deductible and get my car repairs now, I have a case pending and the other insurance still hasn’t accepted liability and I’m going on almost 4 months and geico hasn’t even offer a car rental because my claim was denied I have to go through the other insurance.< /Review>< Date>

<Review>DO NOT COME HERE. THEY DO NOT HELP OR TAKE RESPONSIBILITY. Ive only had Geico for a couple weeks and it has been the worst insurance experience I have ever had. My family switched during the pandemic as we are not working so much and we needed cheaper insurance. I spent days giving them the information they needed to give me the insurance my family needed. I asked questions, and made sure that they had all the right information but once we got all our paper work that is when I noticed the terrible mistakes HE made. First, the names on the insurance policies were wrong. Second, someone that was supposed to be on the policy was COMPLETELY MISSING. The person responsible for making our family policy left out a person of my family. There is only 3 people that were suppose to be on this policy-- It is not that hard. So, not only could we not switch insurance because we paid for it as soon as we agreed but now someone in my family has to drive uninsured because their car is on the policy but their name is not. Now, if they were to fix THEIR mistake the cost of our policy is going to go higher than the policy we had before. This office managed to really damage the well being for my family and all they could do is say sorry. Sorry can not fix the damages you have done. You all should really be ashamed of yourselves. This is a scam and you hurt my family.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None</response><gmapID>0x80c2b4dbe1a5889f:0xc6ba4b474108ac71< /gmapID></record>

Avoid this insurance company like the plague or Covid. They never paid me out for a rear end accident and had the worst customer service I have ever dealt with.

I’ve had GEICO for many years.Never filed a claim for an accident. Price was unbeatable compared to other companies. For years I was happy because my policy was low. I can actually say that I was a happy customer, until that one day that I was involved in a hit and run accident. As  the saying goes “You get what you pay for.” Pay cheap prices, expect cheap service. They expect you to pay for your policy, but when they have to pay out any money all hell breaks loose. It took me 5 months to get paid for car seats that I had in my vehicle during accident. Adjusters are horrible.< /text>

My husband's car had vandalism in a store and I made a report while in that store and Geico wants to pay for one thing only because he says that the other is old, there are cameras and they do not want to check, I do not advise this insurance, they try not to pay  for the damages, now they want me to make another clear report so that they pay the deductible and they pay less<//review>

<Review>Very friendly agents i was in and out in a flash with all my vehicles fully insured. 4 vehicles and a motorcycle. Glad i switched from AAA they were hundreds more. Now every time i see their commercials saying how much cheaper they are from Gieco, I have to laugh. I highly recommend you visit the agents rather than trying to do it yourself over the phone or the internet. Nothing can replace a face to face conversation.</Review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Had a terrible experience with this so called agent ANDRE  ,very rude !!. Requested to speak to his supervisor ,he said he would call me later , no one has called since. Should not be in that line of work if had no desire to deal with the public. To think that I wish going to give him my business, I'm so glad that didn't happen. I wonder if he really spoke to his supervisor about our conversation or that supervisor is the same and don't care .seems like they want just all the easy policies, and by reading all the reviews makes you wonder!!<//review>

<Text>Like another that mentioned about underwriting, they continue to request more documents despite having already sent them. I received a letter stating the application was incomplete but didn't say why. I had to go to the office to find out they needed a copy of my registration. Ummmm... that's what I brought in on day one. They're unbelievable.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

My favorite place for a daily walk or bike ride! Always plenty of fresh air, empty benches and picnic tables, and so much nature to enjoy. My favorite is listening to and watching the various water fowl!</Review>

I’ve been here couple of times, but this my first time back on thanksgiving/ 2020.
No parking fee, no entrance fee,
It has a lot of picnic tables, BBQ area, clean bathrooms, staff working here very friendly, and the most perfect place to capture the fall colors, since the air was calm and the sun was out.
It was a little bit crowded, but everybody was wearing masks and they were good with building a distance.
This park provides a lot of different activities ... such as running,hiking, fishing, walking, bicycling, and of course be modeling.
If I stayed a little later, I will be able to enjoy the beautiful fantasy of Christmas lights.</text>

Great place to take the kids, even if you don't go to the lake. The carousel and train are fun and there is a good playground with a model jet to play on. Large outdoor areas for picnics, barbeques and fun.<//Review>

This park is so family friendly, it has several benches for picnics. Boat paddling, kayak boats, etc you could rent for 1 hr. The boat paddling is $25 an hour but I would advise to reserve your boat on their website especially if you are trying to go on a weekend!!! Anyways there is also a little train and many ducks walking around the park... overall great place<//Review>

Today was a beautiful day out at Vasona Park. Not many people and everyone was being respectable wearing masks. There were some people out walking their dogs. I even saw a cat on a leash. We found a nice area under the shade with a view of the lake and greenery of the grass and trees. Its a nice place to go on long walks and just enjoy the weather.< /Text>

This is actually a great park! The similar park to this one is Lake Elizabeth in Fremont which also offers Kayak/Boating in the Lake. Vasona Lake has smaller in size but offers much easier parking. Also the trails are better and easier to access. For South Bay guys, I will prefer Vasona Lake as it is closer to me...< /Review>

Santa Clara County parks are overrated. The walking paths are paved, crowded and shared with rambunctious bicyclists.
This would all be acceptable if it wouldn't cost six bucks and would serve only the immediate neighborhood.  But for some reason people flick here from all over the county.<//text>

It’s a great park. My comment is regarding the parking- there was a super long line at the entrance which could be avoided. If the cashier at the entry would prepare the change for and the Reciepts ahead of time it would be x4 faster. I’ve seen it done in most parks< /Text>

Recently visit to Vasona Lake County Park. Awesome fall view. Less crowded. A well spent time. No tickets. Can easily get parking. Face mask is must. If you want to see lightning pay $20(visit their site for more details) which happens in the evening</Review>

Too hot to take the boats in the summer. No shadow in the lake. The safe vest makes you even hotter. I do not recommend to go boarding in the summer. Other than that, the lake has beautiful view and lots of parking space, lots of tables for family picnic.</Review>

Beautiful day to ride bikes. The entrance fee for parking is waived until April 5th. The train is running, water activities are open and you can have up to 3 households/25 people max for picnics/gatherings.< /Text>

<text>A lovely park with a lake to walk around. You can’t do the full loop, however as there’s a dam at the other end. During the winter months there is a Festival of Lights driving light show which is very popular. Parking is also currently free because of Covid-19. Usually there is a fee to park. There is also a small playground for kids. There are a lot of different parking lots as well. Parking near the entrance means a little bit of a walk, but you’re more likely to get a spot.<//text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNEKZC9Oz5vX_zTnczsU0nRObN9q6Xpw0e7HooQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMWcEnWU1abpjZAwmo50oeZCcJe5a9TMfmqQRlp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM6q7SQeczgyZqbvNLZFQlQH_H9dIkAatXibmav=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< Response>

Great place to Walk, trail, bicycle.
And Really good place to spend time with family.
It does get a bit crowded at times, only issue was finding a decent spot under shade. Otherwise Totally recommended< /Review>

My dad used to take me here when I was a little boy, now with kids of my own it's great to know this place is still here, not to mention that the price to ride the train or carousel are still affordable along with the food.  Christmas is a bonus EVERY YEAR!< /Review>

Beautiful park.
We spent one whole day and returned home relaxed and rejuvenated. Beautiful lake with boats and ducks.
One side of the park has bbq and the bad smell/smoke travels far, so choose your place before setting up.< /Review>

Best for one day trip. It's 1hour drive from Oakland. Easy to reach. Several parking lots are available. Picnic tables make our meal time easier.  Park your vehicle based on the location. Lake side pretty crowded. So choose week days. You can walk around the lake. Boating is possible. Good to go with bike. You can see different birds and squirrels. It has washroom in different area of the picnic area.</review>

Easily the best park in the south bay - trails are fantastic, particularly around the lake. a lot of benches to sit down and relax. the paddle boats are a lot of fun for both adults and kids.<//text>

A lovely walk with the family.  Love that it connects with LG Creek and the trail.  Only wish you could walk fully around the lake.  Boating here too.  Also connects with Oak Meadow park with the carousel and steam train rides.  Popular but not overly crowded.<//review>

It is well maintained with lots of play structures. It gets crowded quickly because the overall space is small but I think this is one of the well optimized playgrounds I have seen. Kids can keep themselves entertained for couple of hours. The lake is just a minute or two walk and the losgatos creek trail. The sight of the train is fun to watch. Parking at the oak meadow park is better and it's only a five minute walk down to vasona park along the trail. That way kids get a lot of variety.< /text>

< Review>
Vasona park has natural beauty with lots of tree and greenery. It has a small lake with more than 20 ducks which roam everywhere in the park. The ducks get attracted to you if you give them food or if you carry anything. Trails are best for walking and cycling both. Children's and adults both can cycle and it's fun. The best weather to visit would be with one day when the day is less sunny. Also, there are no entrance fees right now, but remember to maintain social distancing.</Review>

Great place for strolling and relax.
The park is huge, there's a big lake, green grass plot. Almost all people wear masks.
That park will be great for everyone.
The park allows to bring a dog with you.< /review>

Beautiful, serene park located close to downtown Los Gatos, meaning easy access to and from the park and also within proximities to amenities. Usually quiet area with clean paths and trails along the lake. Recommended!< /Text>

<review>This park has stunning views it is one of my favorite places to witness a sunset at. One small issue is a decent accumulation of waste which includes plastics and styrofoam behind the plants near to the concrete. Overall this is a great place to spend time at.< /review>< pics>

Also, if you feel like exercising outdoors they have a long jogging track and some workout apparatus. Public restrooms and fresh water also available. The cool thing about this place is the Fantasy of Lights Drive-Thru. Every Christmas season you can drive through an amazing Christmas light show. Kids (and adults) have a lot of fun with it.< /Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP5nl_e3kI-miUM4riIKaWHyn2S7gItaiY0URnn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< response>

Large lake with beautiful trails on both sides - you can't do a loop though.
Lot of parking lots, including ones further away from the lake closer to kids playing structures and expansive open space where you can picnic, or play games with friends and family.</text>

I've been going to Vasona Park ever since I was a wee lad.  It's a really nice little park.  There's plenty of grass for picnicking and playing sports, as well as trees for shade.  Various parts of the park have different amenities, such as tables and playgrounds, and there are footpaths connecting all of it.  And of course, there's a really pleasant lake with boat (paddle and kayak) and paddle board rentals!  Wonderful place for a half-day picnic or just for a nice walk.</Review>

<review>Nice park. A little too congested for me to want to go on a regular basis. Proper bathroom facilities, small boating, ducks, geese, small train, bridge, fishing allowed. Concession, train and boat rentals look to only be open on weekends. This park is good for cycling. Good for walking and running. Very safe. Free parking.</review><user_name>Raven Skyes< /user_name><GmapID>0x808e35bfb5c787db:0x797f4dd6a28a1c24< /GmapID><Date>1602273343084</Date>< userid>

This place is great to go hang out for a day or just stop by for a short visit. It does cost $ to get in and park, but there is another park next door that sometimes doesn't require pays to play and you can walk over the bridge in Vasona. There is a cool playground there too. The miniature railroad is super cool to even just watch. And you can walk along or meet it at different parts of the track. Good place to make great memories!</Text>

<resp>None</resp><text>Amazing park to bring kids for a day of fun. There's plenty of open space to leave your kids at their will to enjoy. So many play areas to engage the kids. Lots of picnic tables to be used for gatherings. Covered ones to be reserved through online portal. The train and carousel are amazing too, though they mostly run on the weekends. There was a community activity going on in the grounds the day we visited keeping it busy.
Overall, its an amazing place to go and relax especially during the summer.</text><Time>1556669631673<//Time><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMc9TA2g9JjSUnPHYZrzpIOfrv8mjy4DhBLMFd_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNrlxe651dATMGKpBlKL5YstJtplun6ojJQFEcn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOkk6ULgq0n3Det7lbZ9_m476B13Y0L8QCvb2Xg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOjqMVaFQUGiNYwZw8IZu5AAe5uSU1eKH0jUIWU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPExLexp5wpmb1FsLOLbirC0eZoKtniMBQ1qjj2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipObpUE4b4-tJapkKj4WI08dwOCLKCODZdEw8YGL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMlOid2n-H4IcFZmBjXQJOq27SSUwzOvsMJhBUR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOjLbGHo0K6vY3AsqpjFEVS5YJsg7w8g-JX1w25=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipODYk4bz7EzkHFbC4YerlTdGsxOblmew4KfY5FL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPWIq0egkR0dmXb1tg44NDDsoBjfarFmH36LSnZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOCvwZqqUuQ7ZMGYNnvv4kztynFxg1uyzY3us-x=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOFOYkLf37W-FhzmL0Pzifll5xZ9ODmirRF8GZQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMnShSlTBpw47HolpgM7M3YicmJ1MpewnfSwz5n=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPvN0w2Wa2Va8ZPQieAbshJ9_-jJk6DagPhUGtw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMwbm_GcWQl4O877JK27dEPQzg2IywxWqwHTuv4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOMOBM_4bp1U7OuBOk8R7HkuYLCLUg23sGzcEZF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP9CDEeKmhCb6kO_lw0hqxvDC8bHPuibxBr5XV0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< Name>

<text>Love love love everything about Vasona.  There's something to like for everybody from walking, hiking, biking, roller blading, canoing, kayaking, paddle boating, pic nics, parties, games, concerts, there is litterally something for everyone.  Come pic nic with view of the lake, relax on the lawn, have bbq's with family and friends.  BBQ areas, bathrooms, parking, paved walking trails, fishing, water sports (non motorized) including the sister park Oak Meadow park next door.  You'll find Billy Jones Railroad, a Carousel, baseball field, horseshoes, pic nic tables with private dining areas you can reserve and so many fun things to do.< /text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x808e35bfb5c787db:0x797f4dd6a28a1c24<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Excellent park for all ages. Oak Meadow playground is perfect for the kids (though it does get pretty crowded). The lot next to Oak Meadow gets full fast too. Good hiking and biking trails around the park. Lots of other fun things to do at the park when fully open after Covid19.</Review>

Beautiful park with a big lake and lots of trails.
One of the best places for picnics, boating, birthday parties, bbq, biking, etc. Lots of ducks and goose to admire. Their Christmas lights that start from end of November look beautiful!
Closes at sunset so be careful of that! (We got stuck inside and a park ranger had to drive us out. :p )
Cabs can't come in to pick you at an inside parking if the park is closed because they close the gates.< /text>

He went out of his way to drive to this park and my first impression as a non-California resident I was impressed by the scenery and space.

There was a lot of people (Saturday afternoon) by the water and the main park entrance... I did like how there wasn't as much at the very back end of the park. I also noticed a lot of people/families not wearing their masks even like passing by othe people. That was the only thing that was sketchy.

Other than that, I want to come back and do a picnic maybe earlier in the day when there is less people.< /Text><name>Danielle Shirley< /name>< rating>

<Text>I only went to the park during the lockdowns.  It offers a playground for children, good open area for activities.  Also offers picnic area with BBQ.  You can go to the lake and take a walk along it.  The Los Gatos Creek trail cuts through the park, you might have a few fast cyclist once in a while.  I could imagine parking being a pain if there is no covid<//Text>< pictures>

In case you are wondering if the park is still open like what I did, it is still open! Google maps is incorrect. The park is still open and still beautiful. The entrance fee is also waived at this time. But it can be a bit crowded at some places in the park. Be careful to maintain social distance. It’s serious!< /review>

Good place for relaxing. Working, running, barbecue, playing with children. There are several parking lots. You need to confirm with your friends which one you will meet there.</Text>

You can even fish for bass, granted they aren't that big but it's perfect to take your little one just to have throwing in a line.  Can rent the foot petal boats and cruise around the lake and have a good time.< /text>< Pics>

Nice for families with small kids. Flat, paved walkways and a large playground. Holiday lights in December. You have to pay for parking inside the park but just outside there is usually plenty of street parking. Can be very busy, not a great place if you are looking for a quiet spot.</Text>

This is a great place to take your kids to show Christmas lights. Be prepared to be in the queue for anywhere between 30 mins to one hour before you enter into the park. The pictures doesn’t do justice, it’s better in person. Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays!<//Text>

We went to a wonderful picnic table in the shade and had a snack. The park was full of Canadian geese and a colony of squirrels right in front of us at the top of the bushes on Constant Guard and loving are carrots. Everybody was very respectful and the park was so clean! I was very impressed how everyone pitches in to help make the park a fun place to go. They also rent out sail boats, kayaks, and paddle boats!!! When there is no there AR wonderful playgrounds for the children and a train that runs the length of the Park 4 the children to see.< /text>< gmap_id>

Such a beautiful spot! I bring my dog here to work on her dog-reactivity - it has wide trails and large open spaces so she can get enough distance from other dogs. There’s also water fountains throughout with dog dishes, which is a nice convenience.</text>

All stars to this place.
A perfect location to enjoy so many things.
Nice grill near the lake shore with benches to increase the comfort.
Almost well mananged park with greenery and enough stops for parking.
Grill needs to be cleaned before cooking anything but that is the case for all parks that provide grills.<//text>

We rented a Pedal boat, paddle boards, and a kayak. Had a blast on the lake. Employees were great with helping me in and out of the kayak. I am a paraplegic and needed help in and out. Great day at Vasona.<//review>

There is a hybrid goose in the park since 2012. I saw him or her many times alone, whereas other Canadian geese live with their partner and raise their babies each year.</review>

Great place for boating walking riding a bike and fishing! Have not caught anything today but found the Fisherman's tree of Shame. I have not made any sacrifices today thus far.<//Review>

<text>It's a beautiful lake Park with a lot of ducks to run away from if you offer them some food by mistake 😂

I also went there with my family to see Xmas lights in drive through and it was beautiful. Got drive through tickets for $20 each but it was well worth it.<//text>< rate>

Park has multiple picnic tables with grills. It has few group picnic areas which are reservable. Has shades of tree for summer picnic. Has few  large parking areas.

Lake has boating facilities. Seen guy fishing in Lake.

Park has lot of trails and biking path. Park has toy train ride fun for kids.

Entry fees per car are $6.</Review>< pics>

<review>A nice park for picnicking with plenty of open space.  Meandering trails for walking, running, or biking.  This time came in through the Los Gatos Creek Trail, from San Jose through Campbell, then arriving at the park.  A relaxing place.</review>< Pictures>

<Review>This park may just be one of the best parks this side of the Mississippi. There is beauty to be found throughout it's vast landscape, from it's picturesque lake to the bounds of grassy fields. This place is perfect for a barbeque with family, a walk with your dog, or even a friendly soccer game. I love this park and I know you will love it too.<//Review><Time>1595487491434< /Time></record></dataset><record>

Love this park. My kids even more. It is a very nice clean park and i pretty much there every weekend. It has a nice train ride and carousel. Adults can ride in the train as well. Kids love the park and rides. Also they have onsite bbq hot dogs and I believe burgers. I have never tried them but other seems to enjoy it. Also they have drinks, pop corn and ice creams available as well. It has a nice park with slides, swings, model fire truck and a model jet where kids can climb up have fun. there are lot running tracks, i have seen folks with their bikes there, picnics and birthday parties. I highly recommend this place if you want to have a good time with family.Parking is $6, train and carousel rides are $3 per person. childer under 2 yrs old are free for train and carousel ride.<//Text>

<text>I love how peaceful it is to walk around this park. You’re very much in tune with nature. My wife and I come here a lot to walk around, read a book by the lake, and there’s even a biking trail. People come here to fish, paddle on the lake, and see the ducks and geese flock together. The park is well-maintained.<//text>< pictures>

Whatever reason brings you here it's a great destination and a beautiful space to be enjoyed by all!<//Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMttycFSMw7-nlXvE4G0S7zQ4HzYhQye0cg5t9u=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNNWwjgntnq4p9U_TnsRFCd_sIOKGwWLzNbO9RL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPRyVAGz6rHfxEDi3fBjrvRpXIeFeXtPe-Dk0Nb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

<review>A nice park for a nature walk less than a 30 minutes drive from silicon valley. Many birds, ducks and squirrels. Park has a nice lake and bridges to walk across it. Nice views of surrounding mountains.< /review>< pics>

Beautiful. Hosted my wife Annie's Celebration of Life here after her passing 12/1/2016. Everyone who showed loved the beauty of the park, and getting the rental was painless. This was at the Creekside site.<//review>

Love this place. The views are beautiful the trails well marked and the people are usually very nice. Yesterday, when I was walking with my mom we stopped to tell the Ranger that we saw some teenagers tearing down the netting around the playground area. The Ranger was super friendly and kind. I didnt get his name but was very impressed with him! Toward the end of our walk we witnessed a man on bike almost running into a little girl on her bike. The man was extremely rude and began cussing causing the little girl to cry. My mom and I stopped to talk to the little girl and her family. They were very nice and with some kind words we were able to get the girl to stop crying. When biking in a crowded public place remember to reduce speed ( if needed) and be kind. Overall still love Vasona!!!< /review>

Excellent facilities for toddlers, great for amateur kites when there's a breeze, you can usually find ducks in the river and geese in the field. sometimes they're even concerts at that little pavilion we really love coming here on the weekend.< /Review>

< Review>
Things have gotten lot better since my previous review. Boating has resumed, lot more folks use the park and lake. It is a great place for family picnic, even during Covid-19 pandemic. I see people social distancing, wearing mask and enjoying the nature.

My Previous Review
This used be very nice park. My recent visit revealed, things have really changed. Looks like a park in third world country now. Looks like there is no boating in the lake. Construction going on several places. Grass is not maintained. Looks like a disaster. Hope city takes some action and brings it back to its original state. There is still annual fantasy lights during christmas. This is a great place for photo shoot, BBQ and picnic.< /Review>

Wonderful local park. Picnicing, canoeing, walking and bicycle-riding, all within the park. They've recently renovated the bumpy bike trail on the east side of the lake, and it is smoother and wider than before -- so nice. On weekends, the Wildcat steam locomotive might be running, providing a bit of nostalgia, as well as a quick train ride for the under-5 set (and their parents).<//review>

My granddaughter wanted to go fishing
I decided to go to Vasona Lake Park. It was lovely day, when we arrive I asked the ranger for a suggestion and gave me directions. We fished from the pier for awhile, but my granddaughter wanted to move to the shoreline, we found a shady spot close by. We did not catch any fish, but had nice lunch saw a big turtle, geese, ducks and various birds. We had a nice time.< /Review>

Really nice and big park. Entrance is free on holidays. Beware to not leave any valuables in the car and remember to lock the car. Our cards were stolen from inside the car probably because we forgot to lock. Fortunately the fraudulent transactions were declined by my bank.<//text>

Great place to come for a run, bike or picnic. they also have paddle board and kayaks for rental so you can spend some time on the water. Lots of fishers around too in case you'd rather have some solitude.</Review>

<response>None< /response><Text>One of the coolest place to visit with family or friends for Sunday evening picnic, outing or just biking. Unfortunately, I went there alone for the purpose of a hike but there aren't a lot of hiking trails here (at least none that I could find). Otherwise great place. Also don't forget to bring a jacket as it gets quite windy in the evenings.< /Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOsK9MhfA-xg9u04NbnnWm6lbKjS_f4q6_57KgH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNG9fDMG5dKAO6eqzKfGIdlj_QWpxCWA4eQF1xW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPUuuTZAW5h9iqUgzsioOZjAYa0KhVOL9SyyHz5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< Rating>

This park used to be the Jewel of the area. Now, it is in a sad state of neglect. The grass has died and weeds are taking over. The ground is not absorbing the water, so, there is standing water near the play ground. (Breeding ground for mosquitoes, this time of year) The geese have taken over in many areas and their droppings are all over the playground; in the sand and walkways, too. To top it off, there is no shade in many areas of the park, and the surrounding areas; where is the heat prevention? (Need more over hangs, where the benches are, and the seated kid rides; the metal is hot!. Water fountains, for cooling stations. Etc) I loved coming to this park as a kid and young adult; now though, I was embarrassed to have brought my friend and his 3 year old. The poor guy was overheating and couldn't ride the swings, or the metal turtle/duck, because they were hot to the touch.
Maybe partner with Netflix, or surrounding companies, to get some volunteers to help out the staff, to return the park to it's once beautiful state?< /Text>

It is very crowded on the day we went their and most people were not wearing masks or following social distancing so that was a bummer but not a fault of the park< /text><user>103173798750592959362<//user><rate>4<//rate><pictures>None</pictures>< Time>

Nice area to relax, have bbq's and walk around. Some people were fishing, hiking, and biking on certain paths. You do have to pay to get in and park for the day. But beautiful area.< /Review>

<Pics>None<//Pics><Text>Very nice park. I went there with my small dog and we enjoyed the sounds of the birds and the water. It is great for running and biking and I even saw that you can rent kayaks for the water. I came a bit earlier than 8am and it seemed closed. I was confused if I am supposed to pay or not if there are no attendants. Either way, there was plenty of parking since it was early. I ran into a couple of people who were running and walking dogs. It would be nice to have a picnic here!</Text>< Date>

Beautiful, picnic tables, grills, play areas for kids, boat rentals. Watch for wildlife, my recent sightings include western blue bird, heron, egret, Canada goose, ducks, hawk,  rabbits, squirrels, coyote. Watch your small dogs because coyotes will eat them.</Text>

One of the best trail run places in silicon valley, miles and miles, with marks on the ground.  Beautiful scenery around, peaceful as well. Lots of running groups on weekend mornings. Enough parking spaces along the trails.</text>

<text>We visited this place for the "Fantasy Of Lights" . The folks light up the whole park with some beautiful lights and it's a drive intour only during Thanksgiving and Christmas. I am sure this is one of the best holiday lighting in bay area. Children love this place. However, one has to book tickets in advance.<//text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMXOHW2LK1o6XbmHanP_TfIKBvaLw7elIouqGeM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMtD96ZEhWCS1G7HH9BRUHZtyhDDWh0ZU7mjxB3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMUMr387TdCfH09GTglmCLBQaAmPVQAYvg3zDk1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

Great park but on the trails people are not taking social seriously. If you hang out on the grass you'll be fine.95% stay off the grass.

Oh do Not fly your airplane or drone. It is not allowed, park rules. I flew my drone 2 days in a row. Second day a ranger sped over in her truck and yelled on her truck speaker "Hey you put that away in your vehicle NOW...."!

Not a great experience I had no clue there are no signs to let you know its not allowed. I did find the park rules on their Vasona's website.

I understand everyone including the rangers are frustrated with the virus.

She could have handled me with some politeness. Other people were very upset the way she yelled at me. I'm 47 yrs old and I was with my children and spouse. Although I was playing with my drone. I'm far from being a child. Kindness goes a very long way especially during all our frustrations.

My family continue to enjoy the park its well manicured and the restrooms are well cleaned.

Thanks Vansona Park Team 👍</Review>

Still a nice place to go for a walk, and the playground is still open, but large areas of the park are closed off for repairs, meaning much of the park, including restrooms, are inaccessible. Orange net fencing everywhere. There are 2 portapotties at the top of the hill next to YSI, which at least appear to be serviced every 3 days, with a place to wash your hands available.

⚠️ A word of caution: I was somewhat surprised to encounter a coyote running around in broad daylight near the Youth Sciences Institute. It was not afraid of me either! Dog-walkers: please be careful and keep your dogs on leash, especially small dogs.</text>

<GmapID>0x808e35bfb5c787db:0x797f4dd6a28a1c24</GmapID><Text>It's got everything you need at park for the whole family. A play area, lots of open green space and picnic tables with BBQ areas for groups/ families, trails for walkers/ bikers and water too! Boating is seasonal. There's an ice cream truck that has a good selection, accepts cash and Venmo.
Plenty of parking lots in different areas of the park. All these make it worth the $6 fee.< /Text>< Date>

Vasona park and lake is one of the best managed public spaces in the bay. Besides the many trails that intersect and connect Vasona lake to bay area bike and pedestrian trails they offer boating, bodyboards,  paddle and sail boats. There are many spaces all with full bbq facilities, playgrounds, bridge, hiking ,fishing and summer  concerts. There is even an ice cream truck on the weekends. The far end of the park has a real scaled down train for people to ride. You cant swim in the lake but with the many water activities there are plenty of fun options. The cost is reasonable per hour for rentals or just relax on a grassy hill. Vasona park is free to walk in. Parking on weekends can be difficult so get there early. The restrooms are clean and well equipt.  Spaces for BBQ need to be reserved in advance on busy days. As well you are only blocks from historic downtown Los Gatos if you crave some great restaurants. Make a weekend of it at Vasona Park! I highly recommend.< /Text>

< Review>
Huge. Open spaces. Access to the river. Lakes. And a miniature railway! It really is a large area for play and exploring. The los Gatos Creek Trail runs through here, and you can always do a walk around the lake. The view South from the reservoir \ damn head is lovely.< /Review>

There are enough people to give a sense of safety, yet not too many to make it a parade route. Bring your own water. Fountains are few.</Review>< Pictures>

This park has it all. It’s got playgrounds, a lake that you can rent a pedal boat during the Summer, they have a small railroad, fields, and walking trails galore! In the Winter, they set up lights all over the Park that you can purchase tickets for and drive through while listening to Holiday music. This is the perfect place to bring your family to, or if you want to take a scenic run through.</review>

< Review>
Need to get out? Covid Quarantine Depression getting you down? I found the perfect place for you to escape to and odds are, if you're looking at this, it's in your own backyard.

Spacious and green fields, plenty of room to social distance from others. Water sports available ($18 for single or a paddle board, $23 an hour for the peddle boats) on the quaint, calm, blue lake. Honestly, it is beautiful! Plenty of trails to walk, bike, hike, etc around the lake as well.

There's a fair number of geese that will honk for food if you are having a picnic and they leave landmines here and there but hey, they're still avoidable and lay down a blanket on the grass and you're fine!

While there are tables still available, for single household usage, the group areas are off limits at this time. Masks are encouraged but again there is so much space that you could isolate yourself somewhere and take yours off for a bit if you need the freedom of being maskless outdoors.

Another "perk" during COVID is parking was free. Not sure if that's for always but it was today! That was really nice. With plenty of good restaurants doing takeout in nearby Los Gatos or Campbell, like Thai Spice or Back A Yard or, if you want to get fancy The Bywater (which you can then eat by the water... At the lake... In the park), it's easier than ever to enjoy a quick picnic in a scenic locale away from your home for a bit and off screens for once.

Enjoy!< /Review>

Place for picnic. They have a train track for kids and small lake for kayaking. We took a short break at Los gatos on our way to Santa Cruz to beat the heat.</text>

Best park around in my opinion. Tons of wildlife, a merry-go-round, working mini train and great picnic locations for groups. It's a huge property too with great trails. I grew up visiting this park and I still love going as an adult. Try it especially if you have energetic kids that need space and activities to wear them out.< /review>

<Review>Need to unwind? Or have a family picnic. There is something for all to do in this huge lake park it's a picturesque place with lots to explore. If you like cycling your in for a treat. The Los Gatos Creek trail is really a must over 20 miles of trails from meridian ave entrance or any of the many trail entrances will put you on the path bring plenty of water and some snacks and your best girl/guy and you can't be disappointed. Even if you don't bring a lunch there are many choices along the way for food/drink. But hold out until you get to Los Gatos downy town offers all you'll need. Enjoy this wonderful park for all ages. And please bring out what you bring in<//Review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x808e35bfb5c787db:0x797f4dd6a28a1c24<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>We absolutely love this park! We got the annual pass even though we are going to be here for three months because we come here all the time. The park is getting ready for their winter light show and it looks like there will be a ton of lights. Kids will ride the train and look at the lights. Soooooo cool.</text>< pics>

Very peaceful place for a walk. Please note that you cannot cross the dam. Stay on the right of the lake as you head to the dam for a longer walk. At Christmas there is a son et
Lumiere around the driveway, quite entertaining after dusk.< /Review>

This park is a great place to go and walk around. The scenery is great, lots of field, kid friendly, and theres even a train that goes around the park. Great place to do photography or a photo shoot.</text>

<review>This place is very pretty. Lots of trails for biking and running. You can rent a paddle boat or a kayak as well. About 20 bucks an hour for that. As expected you will find plenty of picnic tables. Public restrooms available. You have to pay to park but a reasonable $6 a day. They also do pretty Christmas lights during holidays.<//review><Date>1567228141266< /Date>< username>

One of the best, family friendly parks in the South Bay. They have nicely spread out picnic tables with grills, paddle boats, kayaks, and rowboats for rent during summer, and a miniature steam engine that takes trips around a section of the park. The best thing about Vasona is it’s layout. No matter how busy the park, you can almost always find a comfortable section for yourself. If you like jogging, the park connects to the Los Gatos Creek trail near the dam.<//review>

<Text>I think this is one of very nice parks at the bay area, where I can feel fall !!
Very nice lake, beautiful views with bridge, many cozy place where you can spend time with your family, friends.. At first time, this place was recommended by photography clients but I like it a lot now.  I will definitely like it more if I can find a way to enter without paying for parking every time. lol</Text>< Pictures>

The park is large with a long road. There is a lake with a pier and it Is beautiful and calming to see. You can rent paddle boats and kayaks. Great place to walk or bike. There is a train and carousel also. You have to pay for parking but it is worth it.</Text>

It's an awesome place to have picnic style children's birthdays. It's equally great to take a book and chill out on the lawn. They have fishing by the pier and options to go boating, neither of which I have tried yet but look like they might be great fun! Picnic tables, shade, sun, children's park, place to walk - they've provided for everything!<//Review>

<Review>It's a big, vast park with a beautiful, serene lake! And all you have to pay is for the parking space of $6. You can occupy 3 tables for free for the whole day! We had such a good time there, one unforgettable, enjoyable outing experience! Kudos to the management!😊</Review>< username>

<Text>Excellent for runs or walks. You can get up to 8.5 miles each way, so great if you are training for a marathon or half. Biking, for adults it would be boring. Too many people on the trails and you will go very slow besides it is mostly flat - kids on  the hand would have a blast on their bikes. The trails go along several water patches and of course Vasona lake. Makes for a pleasant run/walk/time.</Text>< username>

Excellent place to bring kids for a day of fun. There's plenty of open space, a fairly large playground, and lots of walkways surrounded by nature.
The train and carousel are amazing too - though, they mostly run on the weekends.
This is definitely one of our favourite parks!< /text>

Lake, BBQ stations, peddle boat, Kayak,  train, carousel, playground, and restrooms. Through the main entrance, you will pay $6 for parking. If you have a disabe plate, parking is free. The road split off to different sections with plenty of tables.  Some BBQ pit and tables are reserved so be on the lookout for that.  Train ride is about 10 minutes around the main area with $3 per adult. Children under 3 is free. On summer and weather permits, they sell hot dogs and burgers by the railroad station. On weekends, the park fills up quickly so arrive early if you want a picnic table with lake view.<//Text></record>

Pretty park around a lake. Too bad you can't walk all around the lake, just about 90% of it< /Text>

It's a beautiful park to spend time with family on a nice sunny day. Beautiful lake, a park, bridge, play area all these together make it a wonderful spot to take some snaps too.
It gets really rush on a sunny day and entrance kid of takes time. Too many cars waiting in que to enter and only one person to let them all in. This takes really lot of time. Hope they change that.</review>

Calm and beautiful. I used to go there to accompany kids, they loved the steam train. Now I go for usual hikes, from the lake to the beautiful downtown Los Gatos.  Lots of bathrooms and shaded areas. You can BBQ too if you wish or make a simple picnic. Worth the visit everyday!</text>

<text>An amazing  park. Very big nice open fields. Lots of play areas for the kids. I live how they have a small train that takes you around the park... parking is not free and it does get a little hard to find a spot during the holidays.. but every other day, an amazing  place to go!!</text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x808e35bfb5c787db:0x797f4dd6a28a1c24<//GmapID></record>

<Review>Best park in a wide radius. It is huge, the playground is fun and there is a carousel and little train to ride (for a small fee). Also very clean and great for picnics. Lots of shadow as well.</Review>< username>

Went on a great bike ride through Wassona park it's always nice to see. You can't go in the water but you can go on the carousel on the train ride and you could have a picnic here if you reserve a spot for a large group but you can also just sit out at many of the picnic benches or on the grass,  lots of places for the kids to run around and play.  Pets must be on the leash.<//Review>

<Review>The park is usually very clean. The walking trail is busy. If you are biking be prepared for the walkers to invade the entire path, I hope your bike has a bell. With all that said, it's a beautiful walk or ride.</Review>< pictures>

We went here to see the Christmas and New Year lights. The visit was well organized. Just remember to pre-book your visit beforehand as the visits are sold out well in advance.

This year they had many Dinosaurs, Santas, Elves, Reindeers among others displays. It took us a good 30 minutes to get inside the park.< /Review>

One of the best parks in the Bay area. Wonderful running/biking trail along the lake that goes past children's playgrounds, picnic areas, the rail road all the way to downtown Los Gatos. Great live music during the summer and has several access points which allow you to park for free.<//text>

If you can't find something you like...it is your fault.  Enjoy this gem of a county Park for everyone.</Text>< Date>

<review>Such a big park. Great place to have a pinic and birthdays. Lots of parking, and pinic tables.  My child loved it here. Especially the train and carousel. $6 for parking, $3 for the train ride and carousel.</review><resp>None< /resp>< user_id>

Saw 2018 Festival of Lights.  It was amazing but the line took a solid hour.  We arrived at the gate 45m past our designated start time but they let us in no questions.  The drive through also lasted about an hour driving slow and was well worth it!<//Review>

Open grassy fields with good supply of picnic tables. Favored by families with young children as they also offer a small train ride plus merry-go-round. We came here by hiking at nearby trails, which I'd highly recommend. Connects up with San Jose to the north, Los Gatos and down to the reservoir to the south. Excellent trails. This park offers the restroom facilities useful on the hike.<//text>

Nice place for family. Recently most of the bathrooms are out of service, hope the County of Santa Clara park and services can improve the maintenance to justify the $5 entrance fee.<//review>

This park is always so beautiful and there is always lots to do. You can go on a walk, ride the train, go paddle boating, or let your kids play on their massive playground. Sometimes they even have bands that play here. If you visit Los Gatos this is a must see.<//Review>

I love this park. It's a gem of nature tucked away in the city. Tons of green space, walking and biking trails all surrounding a beautiful lake. I come here weekly with my 2 year old and dog. They have two very nice children's play areas, the park is clean and well kept and it's such a large area you really feel like you're escaping the city. They do charge $6 for parking but it is so worth it. One of the best parks I've been to in the bay area.<//Review>

Very disappointment this year for the Fantasy of Lights WALK THRU. It has become a tradition to attend this event and I have done the drive thru in the past. We arrived at the NETFLIX parking garage were the event was offering free parking/shuttle transportation to the park entrance.  Went to the check in table to find they were not allowing people to enter, at this time it was 8:25PM (the ranger even checked her phone). She had said there was a shuttle schedule on the website. I checked the website and Eventbrite where we preordered the tickets. If there is a shuttle schedule it is not easily accessible AND if there is a last call time it should have been indicated. The only reference to time the directions had was event from 4:00-9:00PM. We arrived at 8:25PM!< /text>

Hasn't changed much over the years except the city keeps trying to find more ways to make you pay. The city parks are way over priced. But this is a lovely park.<//text>

Absolutely beautiful, it's a big wide open Park with many BBQ Pits and a whole range of space to have absolutely fun for family. They have beautiful bike trails and beautiful trails to run of course.

I will absolutely will come back to this park yet again!<//Review>

<date>1518675061445<//date><rate>4< /rate><Review>Love this park and it's been a go-to for a number of years. There is enough to do for the whole family - from the train ride and carousel for kids to boating in the lake or just a nice stroll in the wooded area. A small stream flows through the park that makes for good picnic spots near the water and there are a ton more options with bbq areas and tables etc. Parking on the street can be tricky but for a day long visit the paid parking is very convenient.<//Review>< Pictures>

I haven’t been in three years, i didn’t realize they don’t sell tickets in person... it was a little awkward to have to exit the park and pull over on the road and purchase our tickets on my phone... but it was worth it. The lights had doubled since I had been last and my daughter really enjoyed it. It made our holiday season for sure! Nothing like staying toasty in my car and seeing millions of lights 😍<//Review>

A massive outdoor space, with multiple large grass areas, several picnic areas, a historic miniature diesel locomotive train for children to enjoy as well as a historic carousel. This stunning open space also hosts a moderately sized body of water on which people sail and row boats. I loved coming here as a child and still enjoy it as an adult, I highly recommend if you'd like to bike, walk or simply get out for a breath of fresh air<//Review>

<Review>Picnic spots by the lake are fantastic. The hiking paths are very suitable for a nice walk or biking. Parking costs 6 dollars but the amenities inside are in good condition. The barbecue stands are large for comfortable cooking so all you have to bring with you is the coal and the meat. I love this park!< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Beautiful park with special activities like the train ride. My only complaint is the parking fee of $6 per car.<//text>

<Review>Great local park! plenty of open space, picnic tables and playgrounds. Paved walking/biking paths in the park, good for a nice walk or jog. The paths are part of the larger bike path system, so you can either stay in the park, or just pass through as you head further north or south, on a longer ride. On the other side of the park there is a very popular train and carousel ride and a gazebo where they have performances during the summer.< /Review>< response>

Located south of San Jose, Vasona Lake county park is a great park for family gatherings. Ideal for picnics, birthday parties, kids train ride, boat rides and many other activities. It is also ideal for those who seek outdoor activities such as biking, running etc. The park also offers a great location for bird watching and nature observation. Definitely recommended!</text>

<rating>2< /rating><Text>This review is for Fantasy of Lights.

The concept is nice but a few small changes would vastly improve the experience:
1. We reached on time at the entrance but the way was closed.  We tried to ask for directions to one of the men directing traffic, but he was extremely rude, shouted at us without any reason, and refused to answer any questions.  We asked another person directing traffic a little further and he politely and promptly answered us.
2. In order to get to the entrance, we had to take a 15-20 minute detour since most of the roads were closed.  This was not sufficiently advertised when buying the tickets, the only indication I found later was the sentence, "Event route may be different from online map routes" in tiny font at the bottom of the ticket.<//Text>< Pictures>

Beautiful park in Los Gatos! Parking is not free, but  I think it is worth it. There is lots of room to walk or bike or run. Lots of green areas for picnics, some picnic tables here and there too.

There is a nice reservoir in the center of the park. There is also a very cool kids railroad running across the whole park. For Xmas the park also puts together a light show.

This is also a dog friendly park, so you can walk with your pooch anywhere you feel like.

Lovely park!< /Text>

<review>This is a huge county park. Lots of parking and various open fields with plenty of big trees providing shade. The lake is very calm and the only negative is the duck feces all over the park. Also has a train ride.</review><gmapID>0x808e35bfb5c787db:0x797f4dd6a28a1c24</gmapID>< rating>

Beautiful lake surrounded by a park with plenty of open spaces, playgrounds and a unique Steam Train from the early days of Los Gatos. Boat rentals if you want to take to the water.<//Text>

Review for 2018 Fantasy of Lights Drive thru. Wonderful event to attend. Throughly enjoyed by my daughter. Plan to reach at-least 45 mins before your scheduled ticket time slot. The entry takes a long wait time, but worth it. We will visit it next year too...< /Review>

Close to nature...one of the best parks in bay area. Lot of trees to hangout on a sunny day. Lake side is peaceful. Parking is $6 and can easily get parking spot even on a busy day or weekend. Enjoy.<//Review>

Good place to take a walk. There is a small train that kids can ride on. A fee is required to ride. There are some picnic tables. The group picnic areas requires fees. There is a lot of grass area in the park. There is a lake where you can go boating. There is plenty of parking but fees are required to park inside the park. If you are a resident, you may park inside Oak Meadow Park for free. The park is right next to Vasona Lake.</Text>

<Review>Good park. It is usually plenty of parking. They recently changed the parking payment system and instead of buggy payment machines payments are collected by park staff. Good lake view. This place is popular for birds as well, so be careful when you walk on a grass because of litter.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

Its a great park and is spread widely. It has multiple bbq spots and open fields. We went there for our team event and I really enjoyed there. They also have boating options but we didn't do that. We did bbq and played games in open fields. There is a parking fee of $6 for full day. Lots of options for kids play area. During Christmas they also have great lighting throughout the park. Definitely a great place to spend your day and just relax. Lots of restaurants option nearby as its located near downtown Los Gatos.<//Text>

<Review>Horrible, I'm sure the park is a hoot! The festival of lights is a joke after sitting in an endless line of cars only to get to the gate and was told the only we can get in was to buy   an online ticket that was never advertised and it was sold out for a simple drive through the park 2 hours after it opens!?? pretty ridiculous and a waste of time I wouldn't waste the time or the energy to watch another one of those shows,👎👎👎👎👎<//Review>< Pics>

I like this place, it is full of life and happiness. There are a lot of geese around the lake, they are beautiful. We saw some little cute rabbits too. The park is perfect for families, the children love this place. :)</Review>

This is a nice Park to come and have a picnic. There are lots of different areas you can go and sit, benches around the park and water area or nice grassy areas for sitting on the ground in the shade. When I went it wasn't crowded and we walked around, took pictures by the bridge and sat and watched the birds. The only thing I would say to watch out for is bird poop, just watch your step. But it's a beautiful Park and a nice place to walk around.<//Review>

The plane. It's been there since before my time.  All kids (big and small)still love it. The park also has one of the last "tall" playgrounds left in our overly zealous safety conscious society (plus a couple other scattered playgrounds on the acerage of park). Then there's the lake that's nice to just walk next to on the paved path (watch out for newbie bikers though) and you can also rent kayaks and paddle boats...plus take a ride on a carousel or hop on the little Wildcat train then grab a snack at the shack and wander over to hear the summer concert series. Just don't feed any critters!</review>

This place is a jewel of a park in a jewel of the little village of Los Gatos. With a lake, tons on picnic areas, rental boats, ducks, playgrounds and even a railroad and marygoround GREAT for families, business event and even reunions. This park has a real sense of recapturing a nostalgic time when places like this were common and now it is extraordinary. My hats off to everyone involved in preserving the lovely park.</Review>

The carousel and train were so fun for my three kids. There is a $6 parking fee to park in the parking lot, but if you can find parking on the street that's for free. Hard to find street parking on the weekends, but during the week you may find it. Just be aware you'll most likely have to walk down a hill to get down to the vasona park, playground area.< /review>

Went here for 2017 December night light show drive through. Kids enjoyed well. It is seasonal light show and should not be missed. Book tickets in advance via eventbrite. Be 30 min before because the queue can be long.</Review>

<review>One of the best places to get a good run. Lots of runners, beautiful landscape, geese, ducks. This connects to the Los Gatos Creek trail too. The proximity to Los Gatos downtown also means access to great coffee and food right before or after the time at the park.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

Now that admission is charged and the park has gotten more crowded I haven't been back in years.
It should be nice now (spring, 2017) with all the runoff filling the lake better than it has been in years past.<//review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x808e35bfb5c787db:0x797f4dd6a28a1c24<//gmap_id></record>

<rating>4</rating><review>The park has allot of amenities and is great for family's with lots of kid friendly attractions. The rentable picnic areas have nice BBQs and are well maintained. There is a miniature train that you ride around the park in. A babbling creek that runs through it also. There is also a carousel you plant you children on for a few minutes of relief.</review>< user_name>

It's a nice park especially now that the bike paths have been upgraded. Enjoying the Nature's day or Persian New Year celebration which occurs almost every year in Vasona park at the end of March / beginning of April.<//Text>

Always a nice park to visit.  Usually pretty clean and the size is big enough that it feels more like a trail than a park.  I've been going here since I was a little kid and have always loved it.  6$ for parking.<//review>

Beautiful! Great for nature walks,quiet time. But if you are looking for a nice picnic with kids....just know that there are a lot of bees,almost impossible to eat as they swarm anyone with food.Geese are a great treat for kids to watch,but there are droppings everywhere,including playground.< /Text>

The main disappointments are paying for parking every single visit, and the hours are not the best (gates close pretty early at times). Otherwise, definitely a good spot.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

Beautiful location! There are so many parts to this park. Play structure also has a little plane structure. The train is fun for all ages. The lights during the holidays are beautiful, though very crowded.</Text>

< Review>
One of THE most meditative & peaceful park/lake areas I've ever been to, even with the park noise of kids playing and family bbq parties. It's just a great atmosphere.  If you are in the area, you owe it to yourself to stop by & check it out, even if for a few hours.</Review>

Vasona is a beautiful place for a nice stroll, bike ride or picnic. The place is very quite during the week but can get very busy on weekends, especially on holidays and during the summer.< /Text>

Beautiful country park with trails, a carousel, a train ride, a lake, a science education center, self-guided arboretum walk, playgrounds, picnicking, boat rentals and lessons.  Be prepared for a modest parking fee...or pick up an annual pass at the parks office which is within this park.</Review>

Open kayaks, Paddle Boards & Peddle Boats are available for rent & a small train tours the grounds. Parking is chargeable but it's free to walk through using the Los Gatos Trail.<//review>< pictures>

This park is great in its diversity.  There are playgrounds, excellent biking and rollerblading paths, picnic areas and a pretty man-made lake.   There is a lot of parking although it does get busy on weekends.   This is an especially nice park for families.   It connects with the Los Gatos trail which extends where you can get on bikes.   The only thing it is missing are enough wild areas and native habitat.  You need to go further up into the Santa Cruz mountains if you are looking for that.<//review>

Lots of space, lots of variations: lake, grassy flat areas, grassy hilly and shaded areas, a mini train running through the place. Only downsides are that a road runs a little too close to the edges of some areas (a concern if you have tiny tots or pets) and it can get crowded on weekends. Be aware it costs $6 to park a car< /review>

Greate place for picnics and open air  activities. Our family love this place. It has open fire grills, tables, water. Be careful playing on a grass. There are a lot of geese in that park :)<//review>

Great park for the entire family. Boating, picnic areas, walking and bike trail, sitting by the Creek or walk over to Oak Meadow park which connects to Vasona and take the kids for a ride on the Carousel or the train.  BBQ grills are available in the park at the picnic tables and group areas.
Playgrounds are available too.<//Review>

It's a lovely place to walk along a gurgling creek, or on the newly paved bike and walking trail along the lake... If you like walking on asphalt, dodging bicycles, being sniffed by dogs, and being run over by kids on tricycles!

... Actually, I really like Vasona Lake!</review>

<review>A lake, a creek, a bit grassy hill, tons of grass, a train, BBQ places, tree shades, what else can you ask? This park is a nice park to visit with family during weekend. Did I mention there is also boat renting? Before you sit on the grass - especially near the lake, just beware of the geese and the mess they left.<//review><user>110497774209569267443< /user>< Pics>

Very nice park. Parking is $6, but that's a small price to pay to have plenty of spaces to park. There's a lake here and you can rent kayaks or pedal boats. There are also plenty of BBQ spots and trails for biking.</text>

Great park. Well maintained, many different pieces of apparatus to have fun on...from children safe firetrucks and fighter jets (mixed amungst normal jungle gyms), baseball fields, soccer fields, to an actual steam train that offers rides and a vintage carousel...all connected by a large network of walking trails. There are many sporting groups that meet in this park as well. I've come here as a child, adolecent, and now adult. Oh, Christmas light drive through attraction during the holidays and there is a theater company that offers shows as well. Really a great park.< /review>

Got it all! Lake, paddle boats, kids playground, clean, biking, hiking, birds, ducks, bbq areas, picturesque. Well, there is a $6 or $10 entrance fee (don't remember).
----------------
I downgraded because of way to much geese droppings!  Almost all of the open grass areas are fill with potentially E.coli and its sub-bacterium.</review>

The Christmas lights at the park is definitely worth a visit. Make sure to buy your tickets online before your trip. Entry to the festival of lights can take a while, but the traffic keeps moving ...< /Review>

Christmas lights in the park is an ok-ish attraction. But the only big holiday light display in the bay area. If you have some more time, I'd suggest driving to Sacramento to visit the Winter Wonderland. That's bigger and grand. More !/$.</text>

Huge park with playground, train, carosel and plenty of places for a picnic around the lake.
Great place for biking and walking on the trails and connected to the Los Gatos creek trail.< /review>

Great Christmas lights show. I'd suggest going later at night to avoid the long lines. Also make sure you book tickets in advance - they changed their policies recently to stop tickets 'at the gate'.< /Text>

What a great park, we went on Sunday March 4th and there were alot of trails and pathways closed due to construction, but Oak Meadow park was open and functional. Train rides are $3.00 per person, well worth it to see the kids having a blast on a narrow gauge train. I remember riding on it when I was a kid and I'm now in my 40's. Thank you Town of Los Gatos AND Santa Clara County parks system for reminding us how important it is to help save and keep parks like this with in our towns and city's< /text>

<review>Definitely one of the better parks within silicon valley, operated by Santa Clara County, on the north end of Los Gatos near the border of Campbell, also bordering CA-17 freeway. The park is surprisingly quiet for being that close to a major freeway. Generally it is $6 for parking/entry fee per vehicle unless you have a pass. Facilities include extensive picnic grounds (some pre-reserved for group events, the rest first-come-first served). There is a lake with paddle boats, canoes and paddle-boards rental, and the county park is adjacent to a city park where there is a rideable scale-model train whose track goes thru part of both parks.

Vasona also has fairly extensive walking and bike trails, and lies within the larger Los Gatos creek trail, so traffic on foot and on bikes, goes thru Vasona park, between the endpoints of Downtown Los Gatos and the Willow Glen neighborhood of South San Jose.

There are also regular music concerts on saturday afternoons during the late spring and summer, near the boat house.</review>< pictures>

<Review>Must visit this park and visit for many reasons.
Running, biking, walking dog, bird watching, to play with kids, boating, fresh air, yoga, picnic, volley ball, christmas lights, other events and many more reasons. Dont forget the train ride :) kids and adults both enjoy it. Wave to people as you pass thats more fun!

Plenty of parking available and park is amazing all the year round.</Review>< Resp>

<Rate>1</Rate><Date>1522248611561< /Date><Name>Cynthia Riordan</Name><text>The park landscaping is being torn up with trucks everywhere. Large areas are blocked off and I was unble to cross the large, red bridge.  Many of the areas that used to be grass are dirt.  When a park is in this condition there should be no charge to enter, but the parking validation machine is at the entrance and the work being done is not visible.< /text><resp>None</resp></record></dataset><record>

Vasona Park looks like it's been forgotten about. The plants, trees, and the area that are for planting. Have been neglected. The park itself has been neglected. Sad to see this going on. In the middle of Los Gatos. What is going on with the fund's? Anyone have an idea 💡🤔<//text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) The parking fee is $ 6 per day. There are park grills and benches inside and there are lots of ducks. Canoe, kayak, paddle boats, etc. can be rented at $ 20 per hour. Good value for money.

1일 주차비가  6달러 입니다. 안쪽에 파크 그릴과 벤치들이 있고 오리가 엄청 많습니다.  카누 카약 패들보트 등을 시간당 20불에 대여해서 탈수 있습니다. 6불 값어치를 하는 좋은 공원입니다.</Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMcYsWZG_-wGA4jJocaekL89K5DcIKlpQR1Y_vN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMkpPgjip4sFjPu8Bt-jZuXhy3VhMZqzSFCWg-K=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMfJ5ovvx9obtU1nARs67SO1HWhsS2eXB_FLpLl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< Response>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Nice lake, however it is very busy and does not have much "personal" space. To stop for a snack and then follow your path is perfect.

A long steam train is full of passengers running in the park, making Los Gatos' Oak Meadow Park a park with a small train and a retro carousel.

【逰览Los Gatos的Vasona Lake County Park 】这座公园不仅有美丽的湖景、溪流及宽阔的绿色草坪，还在Vasona湖區旁，建造了機房和火車站，以及近1英里的軌道，让一辆长长的蒸汽火车滿载着乘客在园内奔驰，使得Los Gatos的Oak Meadow Park是矽谷同時具備小火車與复古的旋轉木馬的公園。< /Text>< pictures>
