the sushi was so filling and the portions are quite big. they have a good variety of rolls and the fish was pretty fresh. there’s a little wait time right now because of covid and the location is actually very small!</Text>

I've never been to a sushi place that charges for siracha. That is crazy! We were missing a roll and didn't even want to deal with the staff to fix it.

<Review>Took my family to Bourbon Steak for a celebratory dinner. We had an exceptional meal. After a rocky start a few years ago this establishment has redeemed themselves multiple times over. Quality of food and service is consistently high, steaks are great, sides delicious, and service very attentive. Happy to be a multiple returning customer with positive things to say.</Review>< rating>

<review>This restaurant is absolutely wonderful. My husband and I have been coming here for years. In our opinion it's the best Sushi restaurant in the city. We absolutely love the steamed muscles, squid large, the home run roll, their seaweed salad and many more items on the menu. Sushi planet is still open for takeout during covid-19 and the quality hasn't changed. We're so happy to see this place has remained open during this epidemic.<//review>< pics>

Their staff is very friendly, skilled and responsive!!! We were so pleased with the job that the technician did on our ducts.  He was courteous, professional, and so patient with our nosy dog who kept poking his head in the way. Thanks.</Review>

The sushi is always amazing and at a good price too! But the service is always lacking. Oh well, still the best sushi in town. I would recommend the white roll and the hole in one. They have happy hour too.</text>

Great food. Parking is very minimal.  If you don't score a parking spot by the restaurant be prepared to walk.< /Review>

<Date>1547269233974<//Date><Rating>3< /Rating><text>The food here is great, but the service we received was terrible. We ordered the Garlic edamame, Touchdown Roll (tempura shrimp, assorted seafood, eel sauce, tempura bits), and Happy Roll (spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, avocado, eel). All of these were delicious! But sadly that's about all the good there was. Terrible service seemed to be the theme of the night. We of the 3 groups of 2 that we're waiting, the wait staff pulled the newest group to be seated. When the hostess was notified she looked frustrated and apologized for that, but didn't do much else for the remaining 2 groups left. When we were seated it took a bit before we were able to even place a drink let alone food order. While waiting it was evident that all the tables around us had orders that were forgotten or missed.  The table that seemed to have been there the longest had at least 3 things they ordered but never came.

Despite the service, I will give this place another shot on a different day, if only for that garlic edamame.</text>< Pictures>

<Time>1463503526061< /Time><Text>Good food. Fast servers. No bad smell that sticks on your clothing. As usual ,services in the Bar is faster than the Tables. Noisy on Friday nights. Table in the far-left corner is the noisiest location due to the low-ceiling, mirrored back wall and the sound seemed to  get directed to that corner. Offers good prices during Happy Hour. Parking might be a challenge at night.<//Text>< Pics>

My personal faves are the salmon albacore . Did I mention how great their alcohol prices are during happy hour?  A beer is 1.98, beer + sake $3.</Review>< Pics>

So much yum. Their chirashi is awesome, featuring a chef’s choice of a variety of raw fish over rice. Also try their salmon skin hand rolls and delicious nigiri featuring a selection of mackerel, yellowtail tuna, tuna. Great first impression. Will be back for more.</Text>

Great food but mediocre service. I have been here twice. I love the food and the menu varieties. This time the waiter completely ignored me or forgot to enter my order in the computer. I waited and waited and waited and waited. Even my little son was complaining. I see people that just got seated being served before me. Had to call the Manager. She handled it in a very professional manner and waived the cost of my appitizer. Probably may want to seat in the bar the next time just to avoid something like this to ever happen.</review>

We ate at sushi planet on Friday. We ordered 2 different types of sushi rolls and blue fin tuna from the specials board. Very pricey and it was a long wait even though the restaurant was half full. On the positive side, everything was really fresh and the wasabi was decent.<//Text>

Good happy hour until 7pm on weekdays and 3pm on weekends. The place is small but the staff is attentive and the sushi is good. Considering making this our go-to sushi place in Camarillo.<//Review>

Come here for sunset and you will see the sun set right into the water. Also don't forget to take a couple nice deep breaths to inhale some fresh air from the ocean. I recommend this trail for older people and young kids since it's not bad of a terrain.</Review>< resp>

Stunning scenery and the sunset is to die for. Parking is VERY limited so expect to drive till you find a spot off the side of the road. Just be mindful not to park on the pavement where the bike path is.<//Text>

What a lovely area to walk! If you can't get down to the beach wherever you first approach the edge of the trail, don't give up. Keep walking around. There are several different approaches to the water, and a few of them are MUCH easier than the ones which seem most obvious at first.</review>

(Translated by Google) This is an excellent sunset viewing spot along Highway 1. The coastline has gravel, grass, and houses, which provide a good prospect for shooting sunset.

In addition, I recommend the city of Pacific groove, the beautiful sunset, the nearby 17-mile entrance, the Monterey Aquarium, the pier, the lover’s corner, etc., are all reasons to stay here. I have visited Highway 1 three times, every time Staying at Pacific groove, every time I am next to the coast, every time I am satisfied. Compared with Carmel, here is less hustle and bustle and looks more peaceful.

(Original)
这里是一号公路沿线绝佳的日落欣赏点，海岸线有碎石，有草地，有房子，给拍摄日落提供了很好的前景。

此外推荐Pacific groove这座城市，绝美的日落，附近17英里的入口，蒙特雷水族馆、码头、情人角等等，都是在这里住宿停留的理由，已经三次游览一号公路，每次都在Pacific groove住宿，每次都是在海岸旁边，每次都很满意。这里相比卡梅尔，少了喧嚣，显得更加宁静。</text>

<review>(Translated by Google) There is a very nice path along the coast to go for a walk, which is much used, because there are also benches, pavilions and great trails. But just to see the sunset, many people come here and sit in their cars.
I was there in November and it blew a pretty breeze, so taking jackets with can be very fresh, maybe they sat in their cars because it was too cold for them.

Es gibt dort einen sehr schönen Weg der Küste entlang zum spazieren gehen, der viel genutzt wird, denn es gibt hier auch Bänke, Pavillons und toll angelegte Wege . Doch nur um den Sonnenuntergang zu sehen kommen hier viele Menschen und sitzen in ihren Autos.
Ich war im November dort und es blies eine ganz schöne Briese, also auch Jacken mit nehmen kann sehr frisch werden, vielleicht saßen sie auch deswegen in ihren Autos weil es ihnen zu kalt war.

Even with being short staffed on occasion these folks managed to create the most wonderful meals and a friendly inviting atmosphere. The restaurant and the bathrooms are always clean and they serve the best banana macadamia nut pancakes with coconut syrup you'll ever try.
The chicken-fried steak there is worth a million!<//Review><name>Kelley Albright</name>< date>

<review>Donna's kitchen is like Cheers.  It took only a couple of visits before we were greeted by name, and our preferences for beverages were nailed, cups appearing before we ordered.
The food is fresh, the service friendly, and the prices fair.   If you want a good breakfast or lunch in Paradise, this is the place.  We have not yet come in for dinner.</review></record>

<Text>Owned by a long time friend. I have only eaten there once but it is good food. You won't be sorry for going to Donna's Kitchen. Wait staff- very capable.👍👍👍👍👍 Unfortunately as of about 60 days ago from 7/8/88 this restaurant has closed.< /Text></record>

<text>I really enjoy the quality they bring to your table! It's been a long time since the ridge had a restaurant for breakfast that delivered such quality and service! And their biscuits and gravy are awesome, but so has everything I've had there!< /text>< Pics>

Excellent customer service and greeted right as you step in the door!

Love their breakfast sandwiches; American cheese melted over fresh eggs and side of bacon and hash browns for an affordable price! Coffee is hot and tasty!< /text>

<username>Mike De Witt</username><text>Donna's was good a while back, but the quality of the food and service has gone south in my opinion. However they are pretty busy on a regular basis. I guess the expectation is just low and folks in Paradise just accept it. Only good thing is that it is inexpensive, but you get what you pay for.< /text>< gmap_id>

I had the Bacon & Eggs. They did the eggs over medium, just as I asked... the bacon was perfect, done but not brittle. Potatoes were good and the Jelly was excellent.</review>

I like the breakfast and the service is always good when the young man my server. The only reason I'm giving all three stars because it takes a long time to get your food but the food is really good just make sure you're not in any hurry< /text>

Food that tastes like it was made at home especially for you!  Donna and her help are so fun to be around, what a pleasure to dine here.  Such a nice change to go to a restaurant in town that in not a clone or all the others in town.</text>

Ordered the chicken cordon bleu.  Wanted soup but they ran out.  Wanted blue cheese dressing but they ran out.  Potato was not cooked through.  Put butter on it and it didn't melt.  Chicken dish had cold sauce and the ham inside was cold.  Chicken was luke warm.  The other people at the table had better experiences.< /text>

<rating>5</rating><review>I don't usually write reviews, but this place deserves it. They provide some of the best beer and spirits selections in the area and beyond. They will offer up recommendations and never disappoint. If you're reading this and never been to Giant’s Liquor stop reading and go. Overall they provide amazing customer service with some great humor. Thank you, Giant’s Liquor, for always making me laugh. This place is as legit as it gets and also they have some of the best variety of craft beers in the neighborhood. Some of the more popular ones sell out quickly so it's best to ask what their delivery days are for the upcoming week! Don’t forget to add them on IG! 😎</review>< pictures>

Love this place! Raj is very knowledgeable with beer and has some rare beer that’s hard to find.  The selection is always spot on and changes with the seasons. We found a lot of microbreweries because of Raj’s recommendations. The beer is always fresh and always high quality!  The service is also very personable and they are always happy to see you!</Text>

Giant's is definitely a hidden gem for craft beer lovers with a great beer selection and even better customer service. Raj knows what's hot on the market these days and is constantly bringing in the best and most interesting beers.  If you don't believe me you can check out all the latest shipments on their Instagram page, but if you see something you want act fast - the good stuff doesn't last long!<//review>

Plain and simple. There’s dozens of bottle shops in the area without a doubt. But Giants is super diligent about working with top tier brewers to get an excellent selection of bottles to share with everyone!! Second to that, they are fantastic with communication. Always informative and responsive with questions in a very timely manner. I look forward to more future business and hope others can enjoy the same!<//review><pictures>None</pictures><date>1613290333815< /date><name>Lucas Hoffenkamp</name></record>

Not only do Raj and Priyanka keep their shelves stocked with the newest craft beers, they’re always so welcoming! They also take orders to hold your beers (via Instagram) which makes the process so much more simple. If you have any questions or are stuck between your selections, they’re always happy to provide you with some insight and suggestions that are always spot on!</Review>< Pictures>

The selection of craft beer and customer service at Giant’s Liquor are the reasons why I won’t go anywhere else to buy my beer. The owners are very welcoming and they always have new & rare craft beer available. If you haven’t checked this liquor store out then you are definitely missing out!<//text>

This place is my #1 when it comes to rare and exotic craft brews. I’m a huge sour head, and they always have something ready on the fly or an exclusive drop almost every day of the week!!  The owners are the coolest people, and they will take the time to listen to what you like to find exactly what you need to scratch your “spirit” itch. If you’re a regular/returning customer, they will probably give you a nice discount too!! My boyfriend is a big whiskey guy, and they have some rare finds for him as well when he’s on the hunt for something that’s sold out everywhere else. I’m telling you, whatever you’re Jonesin’ for, they got it!! You have to check this place out. You can find all their daily drops posted on their Instagram @giantsliquor with full descriptions and availability!!< /text>

<Time>1604341091567< /Time><Rate>5</Rate><Review>Giants is by far the best liquor store I’ve ever gone too. Raj and his wife have created such a welcoming environment at their place. I drive from San Jose about once a week to come and get some of their new drops. It seems about every time I visit them that I learn something new about beer that I didn’t know prior. They have an amazing selection all around, you can tell Raj what you’re looking for and he will always point you in the right direction. I absolutely trust his opinions and recommendations. If you end up coming here you there’s no doubt you’ll leave happy.</Review>< Pics>

Great selection of knick knacks, craft beers (IPA, MILKSHAKE, SOURS, STOUTS, FRUITBEERS), ciders & hard kombuchas. The previous owners of this place were great, but the new owners are better (i.e. knowledgeable, friendly, hip with the trends, etc.).

Love talking shop with the owners, being in the industry myself, we share secrets of the trade. 😈😈<//review>

Raj has a gift for making connections, with his distributors and patrons alike.  You will be hard pressed to find a friendlier purveyor of fine craft than Giants Liquor.  Continually bringing in new breweries, and special/limited releases, plus the convenient location, this is my go-to spot.  @brewfomo</text>

This spot does a great job of supplying fresh craft beer to an otherwise “dry” nook of the Bay. Helps that they’re great people too<//text>

Outstanding customer service and an extensively curated beer and wine selection. Ask Raj what to get! He will ask you what style you want and find the perfect beer or wine for you. He really knows his stuff and is a delightful person.<//review>

<Review>I Highly recommend this place if you want to find a good (huge) beer selection. Do not forget to follow their instagram to see their new selections!

Honestly, I cant help to swing by at least once a week to get some good beer (some I can’t even find in the bigger stores) the owners are super helpful when it comes to recommending beer or just to get some basic beer knowledge.

Check this place out the next time you are in the area.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics></record>

I’ve been going here for a few years, since it’s close to home. Beer selection is very impressive for a small store. They get some unique beers I don’t find at the big stores. It is also recently under new ownership and is much improved. Super friendly and knowledgeable staff.  I highly recommend.< /Text>

This place has always had a decent inventory of craft beer, but was lacking in customer experience and rotating selection. Now, under new ownership, the beers are amazingly curated and the folks who own it really take intiative to help guide you in the right direction based on your beer preferences. 6 out of 5 stars, for sure!<//Text>

Came to this store after long time. The store looks so different. It's clean and new owners are very funny and will go up and beyond to get your stuff. I was looking for Hibiki 17 or Yamazaki 17 and they were able to find both for me. Can't be more happy. They made my day! I always wanted to collect both and now I added these both of my favorite Japanese scotch to my collection. I ama customer for life. Give it a try when you are looking for some rare hard to find liquor, beer or wines. Thank you!! Thank you!!</Text>

<Review>I would NEVER recommend ANYONE to have ANY dental work done here. It is always a hassle just to get an appointment even tho I am paying $6,000 for braces that I’ve had way longer than I was suppose to have , Never missed any appointments but yet still have them on . Haven’t been to dentist for adjustment for 2 months now because they are “Short staff” on doctors. Then I finally get an appointment for today at 1:30pm , I come on my lunch break and they are CLOSED 1pm-2pm , Now I am going to be late because I’m going to be waiting on them once again.  I’ve tried to switch offices and make complaints, but they won’t let me switch offices unless it is out of town . By far the WORST service you can get .</Review>< gmap_id>

<Text>I had an appointment at 11. I filled out my insurance info and they had me wait till 1145. And then they told me they could see me at 2. I drove an hour to get here and have to work today. Why would I have to wait till 2 if my app is  at 11? I asked to talk to the manager and they told me they were out for another 2 weeks. This place needs to get their stuff together. Get it all together put it in a bag. At least the waiting room doesn’t have chairs so I can stand for 45 minutes< /Text>< user_id>

<Text>I love this place. I have had extensive procedures done. I've had dental implants, bridge, and 4 crowns done.  The manager Janet was amazing she made it possible to have all this work done and made it possible for affordable monthly payments.  The dentist is punctual, friendly, and informative.  The staff is friendly. I love western dental and will have all my dental needs taken care of here.  Thank you for getting my smile back.<//Text>< userid>

I am pregnant and had the most pain I ever experienced in my life. The people at western dental were so kind and answer every question with patience and respect. The dentist was so sweet always asking if I am ok. I am now in no pain and so grateful for the first night in a while to not to cry myself to sleep. Thank you Western dental.<//review>

< Review>
Beware - if you want a cleaning and basic routine care, you need a full exam at every visit. Mad I wasn't able to book 2 appointments back to back to make sure to get a cleaning same day. So frustrating and inconsiderate of people's time.</Review>

<review>I started with Western Dental in April of 2019 & will be having my braces coming off soon (beginning of May 2021). The whole time I've been a patient here the staff has been very rude & unprofessional. They have only submitted 1 claim which means I've have been paying out of pocket for 2 years now while my insurance has only covered up to $400. I have tried talking to them about billing my insurance but no one can ever seem to help me. I WILL be having corporate run an audit after my insurance pays off the $1,500 so I can be reimbursed because it is no where okay for them to be collecting a payment from both my insurance & I!  I would not recommend going through Western Dental because even though they may seem like the "cheapest" place to get braces … they ARE NOT! Then they'll try & have you sign a waiver stating you can't sue them if they mess up ... LOL I ripped that paper right out of my packet in front of the lady & she looked at me all crazy. I'm glad I didn't sign that ridiculous document because the very same day I got my braces put on the lady dropped a big piece of cement on my lip & laughed like it was funny until I told her that it was burning & she right away went to try & scrape it off my lip with her fingernail! This place is full of charlatans & is just ridiculous all around!</review><pics>None< /pics><Response>{'time': 1615664988957, 'text': 'We are truly saddened that your experience was not as great as we would have liked.

Rather than try to help you find some affordable solutions or temporary solutions they forcibly try to make you pay for the most expensive procedure. They told me I was covered for a root canal and a crown and once they gave me some numbing medicine and then asked me how I was going to pay for the crown.

<review>If I could give them a minus star. I would the customer service here is terrible! They keep canceling my mothers appointment with out notice twice. We take time off from work to make it to the appointment only to hear the doctor is not in or the call center booked for a wrong time. Very unprofessional go some place else. The staff is also rude !< /review>< Pictures>

The worst place to get your teeth done. They wasted my time setting an appointment for an extraction and didn't  even do it. But they were happy to charge my insurance for no service at all. These people are scam artists. Committing insurance fraud. The city councel will hear about this place for sure. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE!!! They are full of lies. I want to know who is gonna pay my lost wages for today. I also noticed the owner will not answer any negative reviews to avoid conflict. I was wondering why they have you sign the waiver to not be able to sue them if they screw something up. Funny thing is i can't sue western dental but anyone can sue the owner. Thanks for that free copy of the waiver idiots..< /text>

Thumbs DOWN for sure! My daughter was scheduled for a routine exam. I am fortunate enough to still be working during a pandemic,  so I requested time off of work so my daughter could attend this appointment. We show up on time and for nothing. As soon as we approach the front desk/receptionist she notifies me that my daughter would not be seen that day due to a dentist not being present. I was not given any other alternative nor was the front staff apologetic or understanding of my frustration. Later that day I called to speak to their supervisor and I was given the runarounds and was told no supervisor was there nor was I able to leave a voicemail. I was told there is no way in order for me to contact the supervisor. My family and I will no longer ever schedule with Western Dental!< /Text>

<text>I had braces on and I told the orthodontist that my teeth weren’t straight not even aligned right and Im very dissatisfied with my teeth and he said that it was the best he can do and now I’m in retainers with 4000$ down the drain and I still don’t like my smile. Plus I still have to pay for my retainers so there goes another 2000$ and I now have to go see another orthodontist to fix my smile that I paid someone to do</text><user_name>graciela douthard<//user_name>< Resp>

<Date>1570143159556<//Date><Rate>1<//Rate><text>Horrible service.  ALL they care about is MONEY....  Had implants with dentures done.  Bottom one broke in 9 months.  Filed a grievance because they said first I had to redo my whole contract that I had already established and pay an astronomical fee.  They responded with a call and said we can leave your existing contract alone but we will replace denture because they claim my husband or spouse called and said I needed my teeth fixed because I was a teacher and my pet had chewed the dentures up.  So nothing would be fixed for free.  Outright lie.   First I have my husband call they would not be able to speak to him about my case because of privacy laws.  Second if I did something to break I would have come up with a lot better lie than my pet chewed them up.  Janet stated Brenda documented it when he called.  Brenda was also right with me when I gave the Dr. the Dentures and told her what happened with the DR.   Janet said how else would they know I was a teacher.  HELLO IT"S IN MY FILE MY INSURANCE is from the SCHOOL system and under employer its my school district.  They just do not want to admit they messed up my dentures.....< /text>< Pics>

Today I visited my implant dentist to get some adjustments to my lower dentures. Everything went really well. I would definitely recommend WD to get implant dentures, they have a great team who really cares about you and your overall dental care.</text>

<text>Had appointment today at 9am. I was sitting in the waiting room while people checked in for their 10am appointments. Didn’t get my teeth cleaned until 10:45am. The dental assistant literally spent 5 minutes on my teeth (10:45am-10:50am) and said I was good to go. Scraped my teeth with a pick and put the gel on them and that’s it. Follow up next day: Western Dental has been calling me non stop all day saying that I was a no show yesterday to the appointment I arrived early to. I’ve asked every time for them to stop calling and it still continues.<//text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Back in January i had my 4 wisdom teeth removed and after a few days i noticed my tongue was still numb. Which till this day a month later is still numb. The surgeon told me it’s normal it will go away in 6 months, however i feel this had to do with him not doing his job correctly. When he was pulling my teeth out it felt that he was being very rough. Now im here scared trying to stay positive it will go away in 6 months 😢</text>

Staff is responsible and the prices are really reasonable .They work with you as much as they can and you are not overpaying for services. This is my second time having braces. My first time was a private office very well known here in hanford and they were super expensive and did not want to use my insurance money. At western dental they used my insurance and did not overcharge me and i got the same services. I am very pleased!< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<Text>Scheduled my son's six-month dental check-up for a Saturday so there would be a child dentist there.   I got a phone call from them confirming the appointment for my son. At no time in that phone call did they let me know there was no child dentist on staff at their facility. After a more than two hour wait in they're waiting room I finally got up to say something about the wait to find out there is no child dentist and that the only thing that was going to happen today was the x-rays that they made sure they got done so they had a way to Bill me. If Google would let me I would say zero Stars. Extremely unprofessional cannot believe they run their business this way!<//Text>< gmapID>

DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE. Front desk does not know what the hell theyre talking about. One day they tell you one thing then tell you the complete opposite the day of your appt. Waited over 2 hours just for them to tell me something i already knew. The DOCTOR WAS SITTING IN THE BACK ROOM ON HIS CELL PHONE while patients were seated waiting on him for over 2 hours.</text>

This western dental has to be worst place ever for braces! They are always running behind, the staff are rude and they make appts then tell you that you don’t have one. Super WAC!! 2 months later and nothing has changed! 2 hours for a check up for braces!! I would recommend NOT to go here unless you have 2 hours to wait every time.<//review>

HORRIBLE!! Made an appt for my 2 children. I waited 3 hrs and they had only done 1 child's x-ray, NO cleaning or exam.  My children 3yrs and 4yrs are very polite while waiting but they got antsy after 3 hrs.  The dentists and assistants were all in the back room having a meeting and laughing while we were waiting.  We left after no one had checked on us in over 1/2 an hour.  They then CHARGED my insurance for both children X-Ray and full exams.  I called and they hassled me about it.  So I simply waited till they were eligible for another cleaning in 6 months and went to another dentist. DO NOT GO HERE!!< /Text>

<Review>The staff was unbelievably rude. The girls in the front desk put in my insurance information wrong which lead me having to do so much more work then what was needed cause of their mistake. I well overpayed because of their mistake with insurance & now my payment is being audited through corporate so it can be fixed that they said takes 10-15 days.I walked in on a Wednesday asking for an Itemized receipt after paying my total amount due over the phone with corporate after being told I can just walk in for a receipt. Well the front desk girls told me on that day it needs 48 hours for them to be able to print it. They told me to come back Friday. Which I did. Well according to the same exact girls...its impossible for them to print a receipt..so they mailed it to my address...after explaining im moving out of state! Call corporate AGAIN they explained they are going to send me an receipt to my email 2 days ago...I have yet to get a email or call about anything. I have never experience such awful customer service probably ever. Im moving out of state in 2 days. All I need is them to fix my insurance information&an   Itemized receipt&refund me what I over paid because of THEIR MISTAKE of putting my secondary insurance for my primary&visa versa. Never coming back nor do I recommend Western Dental more so because of their awful Front house Staff.< /Review>< Pics>

If you plan on wasting your whole day for no reason and have your appointment canceled for no reason go to this PLACE! Plan on listening to Rude Receptionist and Staff giving you every excuse known to man telling you and everyone else why they can’t see you. I wonder if this is an actual business or some type of insurance scam because no one is working and customers are not being seen at all and turned away. Staff are solely there to collect a pay check and not work. When the Staff actually get up off their lazy chairs to work, they purposely don’t keep appointment times resulting in being there for hours past your appointment. Bring a large cooler with beverages, sandwiches, snacks and prepare to be there for Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner. Hell, might as well bring food for the Rude Staff too, maybe they’ll actually work if you feed their faces. This place is a SCAM and using the Western Dental name to collect your insurance money. Some one call the Police because we are all getting SCAMMED!</review>

Western Dental has very much improved. I would like to share my experience and it has been great. I can check in quickly and have been called back just as quickly. Take care to note it is important to ask questions and know your own treatment plan when walking in any office in the case there could be a mix up that needs to be corrected. It is always necessary to know about your treatment plan and any concerns by asking questions and listening in case issues arise in any situation that may concern your health. The receptionist and dental professionals at WD are helpful and courteous and provided me with options to a payment plan to choose from that would suit my budget. The dental provider that is working on me is exceptional in his work he is fast, gentle, and explains every procedure as he goes along. I am very pleased with my new experiences here at Western Dental office in Hanford off 11th ave. Great teamwork!

Warm Wishes, Deborah Moroles< /Review>

< Review>
ANY parent going here needs to read this!!! So I have a four year old daughter that was up all night crying about her two bottom  molars  hurting, you could see inside on her gum it was swelling and full of puss. We took her her on short notice. The doctor said it's going to be $800 to pull these teeth, but I'll do it now for $700... I asked if they had to be pulled and he said yes and it needs to happen now before it spreads.. so I said ok...  they she was screaming the entire time and gushing blood for hours after.. I took her a few other places and this is what I found out from multiple dentist.. one they shouldn't pull two major teeth on a four year old, second there was no way they could of numbed her because the infection causes liquid in the gums like puss so when they inject a liquid numbing medicine it doesn't do anything!!! She felt the whole thing!! He should of given her a antibiotic to take the infection out but he didn't knowing she couldn't be numbed!!! I'm so furious and taking legal action... she's four years old and now horrified of the dentist..</Review>

<Review>These are the most un-organized, goofiest people I've ever dealt with.
X-rays and Exam - $400, no problem insurance paid, but now I need a specialist, OK waiting, 1 week passes, I call them, they say the specialist is on leave, the only one, and comes from out of state, such a Mickey Mouse company, a lot of un-educated workers fresh out of high school it seems, not professional at all, in fact it seems like most of them don't even know what the F**K they're doing.  I've already switched providers, but still waiting on these creepy chicks to send my referral....UGHH!@!!$#&%!!<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Text>This place is a RIP-OFF ! They will tell you need a bunch of unnecessary procedures especially if they know you have somewhat decent insurance! I should’ve listened when all my coworkers warned me about how they scam you and when my sister warned me about this specific locations  roach issue (which I saw for myself with a dead roach in the corner in my exam room!)  and switched Dentist. But I was switching jobs and wanted to use my insurance before it cancelled for my yearly cleaning and they’re were the closet Dentist to me . So during my appt in October their Hygienist did an exam on my teeth and told me i had a mild case of periodontal disease and had to have a expensive deep cleaning done on my teeth. It was a two part cleaning and I paid my co pay for that one and scheduled my second part of the next month, now I moved before I could have the second service performed and after looking over my contract found out that they had also charged my insurance for 2 fill ins that were never performed! So I went to this location and spoke with the office manager regarding the charges on my contract for service that wasn’t even done and wanted them to be removed. She did that for me and I paid the balance I owed them because I wanted to have  it satisfied before I left the state. She told me that my balance was 0 and my account closed this wasin December. Now here it is May and I’m getting calls and letters from a collection company telling me that I still owe them $370!! When I paid them almost $900 last  year for a service I didn’t even damn need because after visiting a dentist where I live now, I’ve been informed that I DO NOT have damn periodontal disease and was I  SCAMMED OUT OF $900!!!  And they are still saying I owe them $340 more!!! DO NOT GO HERE OR ANYOTHER WESTERN DENTAL FOR THAT MATTER! ALL THEY WANT TO GET IS YOUR INSURANCE MONEY!< /Text>< Pictures>

<Review>Please do not go to this office. I had 8 teeth pulled by a brutal dentist, no pain medication, I was told by one the dental assistants that I didnt need pain meds because I was getting them pulled anyways. Also the BRUTAL dentist pulled my teeth on my right side when I was not numb. The BRUTAL dentist that pulled my teeth left teeth fragments in my mouth and put my stitches in without taking the fragments out. The staff mainly the main dentist told me that I would get monies token off of some of my services and that was a lie. I made 2 complaints and they only took $422 off of my account supposedly.  The brutal dentist goes to a lot of Western Dental's in this area. Now I am dealing with rude calls every day and all day. They lie and they are rude. PLEASE BEWARE OF THIS DENTIST OFFICE. NO HUMAN SHOULD BE TREATED THIS WAY.</Review>< UserId.>

<Text>Receptionist are very RUDE! They have 3-4 Receptionist working that have no idea how to manage and or keep appointment times. Every time I have an appointment I’m never seen on time or within the hour of the appointment time. Expect to be there for 3-4 hours past your appointment time. This Western Dental is like the DMV. Might as well make it an all day event and pack a Lunch, cause you’re going to be there all day if you’re ever seen at all.

I have never been treated so badly in my life. I had an appointment and checked in with the Rude Receptionist. The Receptionist told me my appointment was canceled for some reason. Then all the Receptionist starting laughing at me because of my appointment being cancelled for no reason. Disrespectful people. I’m horrified to go back.<//review>

Dental Office? More like a Mental Office for the Mentally Challenged Receptionist who can’t even sharpen a pencil if their life depended on it!
Western Dental? More like Western Mental Faciility for Lazy Incompetent Mentally Challenged Window Licking Receptionist who are looking at midget porn when they are supposed to be working. If you want to waste your entire day and see a free Freak Show for Mentally Challenged Receptionist go to this Western Dental. Don’t expect to be seen, don’t expect to keep your appointment time, and dont expect the Receptionist to have half a brain to do their job to keep appointments. What a bunch of FRUIT LOOPS!</review>

<review>Not helpful at all.  I’m finding another dentist. They have a 15 min policy. And I’m coming from lemoore. And I’m 16 min late. 1 min late. And no one wants to help me.  Didn’t even ask if I want appt. The girl in the front desk have this mocking laugh in her face while I ran to get there in the desk.  But nobody is flexible to hear me out why I’m 1 min late.  Don’t go here. Terrible receptionist.< /review><user_name>Eldhanna Liss< /user_name><Pics>None</Pics>< Rating>

I had got my appointment but it turned out that I couldn’t go in because it conflicted with my school schedule, so I rescheduled my appointment and unfortunately I had to wait a month before they were able to take me in again. Service is slow, staff are rude. Overall seems like their gossip is more important than their patients. When with patients staff speaks Spanish assuming that their patients won’t understand. I’ve got to say that when I call in, it seems that I speak to Maria, and not once could she have been nice she is rude. Folks, if you are looking into a place to get ortho work done this is not the place. Try the one on Lacey, personally I have not gone to that one but give it a try, i’m sure it’s better than this place.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x8094c3838ed0879d:0xc315b7847eb046ff<//Gmap_id></record>

What a bunch of Acrobatic Clowns! If you want to see a Real Circus Act, go to this Western Dental on 11th Street! I’ve never seen so many people work so hard to not work. These people will not help you at all. If you suddenly collapse in thier lobby don’t expect the Staff to help you or call 911, they’ll just laugh at you while they’re surfing social media behind those computers. These people will probably take a selfie of your corpse and post it on social media because the only thing they care about is how many LIKES they get not customer service. Someone please push the POWER OFF BUTTON on this place!</text>

This place is just awful and I hope no one eats stuck here because of insurance. The head staff barely do their jobs and are disorganized as all hell. I can't list any names because only 2 people wear name tags and they did a great job. The head dentist and orthodontist don't know what they're doing and don't take their patients into consideration whatsoever. The dentist was much mor concerned with his phone rather then his 4 patients that were waiting in front of him. And then when the orthodontist came over she looked everyone overs and told everyone to floss or brush more and then left the nurses to do all of her work while she fiddled with the radio stations.</text>

Never again! Should've listened to my gut after I read the reviews before my first appointment & cancelled. I made an appointment for (1) immediate treatment of an abscess & (2) a full exam for a future plan for the rest of my problem teeth. First the X-ray tech was obviously inexperienced & I had no less than 20 pictures taken and she had to get help. Never on my life have I had that many x-rays & I've had oral surgery & extractions previously. Then I meet the very young dentist who does a great exam & I explain to her I am well aware that many of my teeth have issues & the possibility of dentures is very real & accepted. I expect her to first address the excruciating painful abscessed tooth, but no all of a sudden nothing can be done & I need a full mouth reconstruction!?!? My whole mouth needs to be what? So she writes a referral to a prosthodontist. I call DentiCal, tell them what has happened (because the office mgr @ Western dental sd she can't refer me directly I must call my insurance) the first ask if I've been in some sort of accident or even have teeth at all. I inform them no accidents & I have the majority of my teeth still - they are just weak, prone to breaking & I have an abscess (oh yes, the dentist did hand me a script for amoxicillin & ibuprofen). They say the nearest prosthodontist is approximately 4 hours away & I better tell Western dental that is not an option & get a second opinion. I call WD tell them the insurance Co thinks ur insane (so do I), I want to see the much more experienced dentist in the office & WTH about this abscess. Told them I called an oral surgeon, but she needs to have a referral specifying which teeth to remove (duh). So they bring me back in, other dentist looks at me for 23 seconds says "it's beyond my expertise" & I say then refer me to someone who can - that is then the help I need. He walked away. Sends in idiot office mgr, now I'm angry & tell her do you Know that an untreated abscess can be life threatening, I'm trying to get treatment, I'm entitled to treatment, I want treatment. All a sudden here comes Mr walk away & he now claims he sd he could pull it. No you did not. You sd beyond ur MF expertise. Ripped up the referral to the unattainable unreachable prosthodontist & threw it at her. Now why do I think they refused to treat me & blame it on my mouth (BTW they never explained why I needed a full mouth reconstruction)...I'm 100% disabled due to mental illness & her first question after my exam & B4 my sudden referral was what is ur illnesses-im honest about these things because it helps the Dr treating me. And secondly I told her any pain MGMT would have to be in conjunction w my GP as I don't do opiates unless there's no other alternative. These things scared them. I called them out on it & I've reported them to the ADA, DentiCal & the state board of dentistry. Everyone I've spoken to has a nightmare story about Western dental....there's so many reasons why. I'm seeing a specialist in Fresno next week - they we're appalled to hear I had the abscess still...<//text>

<Review>I went in last week to get an exam done an i my experience was wonderfull. From checking in to getting called back to see the doctor the staff was nice and worked fast. When i saw Doctor Ara he was very gentle with my exam and he explained everything in details. I wish i was able to get all the girls names because they were all wonderfull and attentive during my visit they all deserve a raise. I want to especially thank the front staff Maria, veronica, jeanette and janet for being so polite and welcoming me with a smile. That is what good customer service is not like other places where they dont want to help or look like they dont want to work. Thank you girls and doctor ara for making my visit wonderfull will definately be back again. :)</Review>< Pics>

I really like the staff and office here. They're very friendly and helpful when it comes to dental hygeine. Maria and Isbel are very kind and can quickly resolve any situations and sort out any confusion. I go here for both dental and ortho. Vero might rub off as an intimdating woman at first, but she's actually really chill and knows what she's doing because with her work and advice, my teeth are shifting a lot faster than expected but in a good way. The same goes for Janet, very helpful and kind. Unfortunately I'll be moving out soon but I will definetely be coming back in town for my dental and ortho because of their great and friendly service.<//Review>

<review>service is horrible. My son was seen there for a routine check and they offered a free orthodontist check, so we did that and my son needs braces. We find out that my insurance is only accepted for dental and not orthodontist services at western dental. So Western Dental tells me to find  out through my insurance who can he be seen by. So I did. And this is when all the issues start. I go back to western dental and tell them I need a referral to the orthodontist, they tell me no I don't, just go, and they will do the referral. So I do that, and now everything is being denied due to the fact that the primary dentist (western dental) has to put a referral in. I called western dental back, multiple times and they refuse to call me back, even the office manager. And in case you are wondering, yes we have now changed dentist.<//review>< userid>

We used Sherwood Florist for our wedding flowers and they did a wonderful job! We had a small ceremony at City Hall in San Francisco, and needed a bouquet, boutonniere, and four centerpieces for our reception after. I met with Alina for a consultation and had a rough idea of what I wanted, but was open to her suggestions. She exceeded my expectations and did an amazing job on all of our arrangements. My bouquet was breathtaking and the centerpieces were a perfect fit at our reception. We opted to bring the flowers to San Francisco ourselves and when we picked them up they were carefully packaged for transport. I am so grateful to Alina and team for their hard work and attention to detail. The flowers at our wedding were truly a spectacle! I highly recommend Sherwood Florist for any and all floral needs.< /Text>

I sent the arrangement with the pumpkin vase from abroad to a family member in the hospital, and her exact words when describing this arrangement were: "Beautiful! I've never seen anything like it. People stop by to compliment me on the flowers all day." They were delivered on time, the price was not too high, and the recipient loved them! Great florist, highly recommend.< /Review>

I made an online order (which was extremely easy) for same day delivery, they went above and beyond to make sure it was delivered on time. The lady I spoke with was very very kind and extremely helpful. The arrangement was beautiful, the flowers were fresh and lively and very strategically placed. I will definitely be ordering from here again.< /review>

We're EXTREMELY pleased!  Ordered a gorgeous Garden Comforts arrangement that came with a little bird and in a Beautiful basket for our Mom to enjoy well before Mother's Day and the flowers were delivered mid-afternoon by a man who was very cordial and thoughtful!  The arrangement is fresh and should last for a long while to still be in pretty shape through Mother's Day and beyond!

The entire experience was a Joy for us to know that the arrangement was delivered on time and Mom truly Loved her gift!  What a Blessing!  We have been very satisfied with the Service that Sherwood Florist has provided for us in the past and we see no reason to change!  We highly and Thankfully recommend Sherwood Florist as they are more reasonable than many other florists and they are Gracious and Quick to deliver whatever we order!  Thank-YOU!, So Very Much!

<text>I ordered a bouquet remotely from the East Coast, and the initial bouquet didn't seem to match the picture. However, the florist fixed it and the bouquet delivered in the end was GORGEOUS, better than pictured. Also my friend who received the delivery said that the owner was super sweet.</text><userid>101817728856993174825< /userid>< Rate>

My daughter recently ordered flowers for me from here, they were just so gorgeous & lasted a long time! I've also been into this shop myself several times. It smells so good when you walk in. I love the flowers, the homeade chocolates, jewelry & beautiful gift shop selection. It's always such a lovely & friendly experience, the owner (Alina) has really given it that personal touch. Especially during the holidays (like now) when it's so beautifully decorated. We'll be going back again & again...☆☆☆☆☆< /review>

The flower arrangement was exceptional - delivery was early as requested and ordering/paying was easy. Will definitely use again!</text>

<review>Very nice women that sold me this for $39. I will use again for future florist needs. I also enjoyed the neat storefront in the Village.</review>< Pics>

<user_name>Sherry Brown<//user_name><text>I love this place. Since we are out of the area we needed a reliable source to deliver flowers to our mother. I worked at a floral shop so I know a enough about the business to know if the service, quality and talent is real,  This place is the real deal.  I have talked to the owners and designers and have only good things to say about them. Many times I have called at the last minute and they always take care of us.  My mother in law in always in awe when she receives an arrangement. If your looking for a reliable, experienced and talented florist this is the place for you. I highly recommend Sherwood Florist.< /text><Resp>None< /Resp>< UserId.>

This place is amazing! They literally made the exact arrangement I was looking for custom on the spot, with a mug a stuffed animal and truffles, all for under $100. The staff were very thoughtful and pleasant. It's been a very long time since I have received service of this caliber.<//Text>

This place is great,I have been in there and have seen wonderful displays.  But this time I needed help.  Some online place forgot my order for my wife"s birthday so I called up about closing hours. They took my order and delivered it within one hour. totally saved the day,and a beautiful dozen roses. thanks  I will always go here for flowers</Review>

You're lucky to get anyone that works there to even acknowledge your existence. I waited over 15 minutes to get a hello and then waited for the walkin customers to get their order filled to pickup my prepaid flowers. Almost 20 minutes to spend 5 seconds getting me out the door. Guess they don't care when they have your money already I can basically get the job done at Safeway. No reason to go out of your way for this place...<//Text><Name>Ashton Kelley</Name>< Time>

Was told a corsage cost $29.99 and agreed.  Then was told to pick out a keepsake bracelet.  When I was rung up the total was $53.  The keepsake bracelet was an additional $19.99.  Wish he was more upfront.<//text>

<Review>The women working here are very nice. However, there is a very rude man that works there that will try to sell you anything, and he will also up charge you for things without telling you. The corsages and  boutonnieres all broke. Flowers fell off all of them because they are just glued with cheap glue, and they are pretty expensive. Some of the flowers were already wilted and then just fell off within 5 minutes of wearing them. I would never go to this location again for flowers especially if the man is working because he was so rude and made our group uncomfortable.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>2 am appointment. It is a tight place for OTR trucks, I arrived 10 min before my appointment,  parked out of the way, walked inside with information needed and had a door by 2:05.

Parked in the door and walked back to notify shipper and took a nap. By 4:30 I was loaded, shipper was at lunch so I took my time to close the doors and get my tandems set. By 5:10 a.m. I was at the TA scaling.

Overall,  everyone was courteous. 24/7 Monday through Friday and please respect that they have scheduled breaks and lunch.< /Review><rate>5<//rate><user_id>100642053165238491250< /user_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>LAZY PERSONNEL. I HAD 2 DELIVERIES YESTERDAY. 1 TRUCK WAS ON TIME 30MINS BEFORE HIS APP & STILL TOOK THEM 8HRS TO UNLOAD 20 PLTS. 2ND TRUCK WAS LATE DUE TO SHIPPER'S TANKING LONGER TO LOAD ( KEEP IN MIND THIS WAS A 50MILE TRIP) THESE LAZY AS H##S CHARGE US LATE FEE & STILL TOOK THEM 8HRS TO UNLOAD. SO IF YOU ON TIME THEY TAKE EXTREMELY LONG TIME & IF YOU LATE THEY CHARGE YOU & TAKE LONG TIME. THEY DO NOT ANSWER THE PHONES. TRUCKERS STAY AWAY IF YOU CAN OR MAKE SURE TO BILL YOUR COSTUMER MORE MONEY TO COMPENSATE ALL YOUR HRS YOU WILL WASTE HERE. I WILL SUGGEST ANY TRUCKER TO AVOID LOADS GOING TO THESE LOCATION OR LA MIRADA,CA I HOPE UPPER MANAGEMENT READ THESE COMMENTS FROM ALL THESE PEOPLE SO THEY CAN START RESPECTING THE BACK BONE OF AMERICA, US TRUCKERS..!!!!!</Review>< gmap_id>

No one answers the phones...brian(operations manager)is unavailable and no where to be found or contacted....somethins goin on over there that sidetracks people in the office from answering calls etc.. Expect HUGE delays in getting ANYONE to respond back at all...not good..being "busy" at both locations isnt a valid excuse either...gotta have SOME accountability...jeez<//review>

Horrible receiving practices. Stay far away from this place. Slow workers - We were late for an appt after driving 2.5 hours in traffic to get there from the port.  Denied our driver unless we paid for overtime.  Even though it was during the course of their hours of operations they requested overtime pay in order to receive.  Every Weber facilities is the same as these bozos.</Text>

< Review>
I really enjoy coming here for lunch when I can. My usual is the ham and cheese with the French roll. You cant go wrong. The side of macaroni or potato salad may seem small but believe me it's enough.... all in all. Tummy stuffer is the best sandwich shop on slausan .my name is Ryan  ruiz and I approve of this message.<//Review>

<review>Ordered the Turkey breast sandwich with provolone on squaw bread, yes squaw bread ( hard to find ) Sandwich was delicious, girls behind counter were polite, professional.  Price was very reasonable, great variety of sandwiches and salads.  I will definitely be coming here again.  A little diamond in the rough catered to fill your tummy.</review>< Response>

<Text>This is the best company I've ever used! They helped me out with my moving from San Diego  to Las Vegas.
But I needed some days to hold my whole stuffs in the storage. And this company has her own storage, it was very comfortable for me.
I didn't waste my time to find moving and storage.
All my stuff was packed and moved without any scratches.
I definitely recommend Rhino Moving.< /Text><Time>1624028744763<//Time><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN12_m0I8Mw3sR8QG4J3zBa6faPFyDgHOnKMVDm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPOPLZzthKSV7t62mh2EdxQPPWBweuuZdF9Dx_7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< resp>

Fantastic, organized, no-nonsense, friendly movers. Four strong men and the big trucks arrived exactly on time and got straight to work. I appreciated the care in which they wrapped my items and made sure everything was safe and secure. I felt comfortable from start to finish. They even took the time to re-assemble my bed once my items were moved in at the new place - and they did it faster and better than when it was initally delivered two years ago! I paid exactly what I was quoted for the move - no extra fees or cost changes.

I would not hesitate to hire Rhino again. I will recommend him to anyone that is in need of local or out moving services.</Text>

Absolutely wonderful to work with Rhino Moving!  From management to staff, they are professional and hard working.  I requested a certificate of insurance and received it immediately, unlike other companies. It was my first experience to move so far, I was moving from San Diego to Phoenix
They showed up on time, promptly called me. They had on hand all the packing materials that I could have needed.
The packing & wrapping job was one of the best I've seen. Took great care of my furniture and everything arrived in same condition.
I would definitely recommend these movers to anyone. If I find myself moving again, I'll definitely use them. Thanks again, great job and good luck!<//text>

Rhino Moving provided the easiest, most efficient, and drama-free  moving experience I have ever had. Andrew (AJ) and David were an absolute delight--they punctual, respectful, and extremely accommodating throughout. When we ran into a hiccup with a loading zone at my building downtown, they immediately figured out the best way to unload given the unexpected circumstances, which required them to walk up a flight of stairs, instead of using an elevator. They did all this with zero complaints, and still unloaded everything so quickly. Separately, the booking experience was seamless, and Alexei was really helpful, and remarkably responsive when I booked and confirmed my move. I will absolutely recommend Rhino (and AJ & David specifically) to anyone moving in the area! Thanks so much!< /Review>

Alex and AZ did an amazing job! They were very careful wrapping everything valuable, yet moved quickly and efficiently to move an entire house in a day. I will definitely be calling them again next time I move and recommending them to my friends.<//Review>

<Text>I had an amazing experience with Rhino Moving. The team arrived on time, packed up everything carefully, and moved everything into our new home. No damages, polite movers.
This is my second experience with moving. With the first one I've had very bad experience, of course not with this company.
But Rhino Moving is very efficient and I definitely recommend!
Good job!!!</Text></record>

It was my first experience with this company. But I choose after reading all of the good reviews. It was easily done online. The company responded to me over email and phone very quickly.
The team of this company arrived on time. They protected all my items and packed the truck with efficiency. What was the best that they have a storage that can be accessed at any time. I definitely recommend this company!</review>

I have done many moves, and these guys were great! On time, hard workers, careful with my belongings, professional and reasonably priced. Alex the owner was open and flexible to my needs. Bradley and Daniel did my move and were excellent! I will use them again!</text>

<review>Drivers are absolutely clueless when they see "Slow Vehicles Use Turnouts". Instead they plod merrily along at 30mph, with traffic stacked up behind them, passing numerous large turnouts and using none of them.< /review>< gmapID>

<Review>Rhino Moving is the best moving company my family has used. We have used their services two times now and they are the best. From management (Alex-owner) to staff, they are professional and hard working. If you live in San Diego and need moving services, you should definitely give them a call!< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Time>1615413496925</Time>< username>

If I could give this company a ten star rating I surely would.  After my 89 year old father's life was threatened by his stepson and he was forced to flee from the retirement home where he was living in San Diego, CA, he moved to Klamath Falls, Oregon, to live closer to me.  So we needed to find a mover willing to pick up his things without him being there.  I called Rhino Moving Llc on a Tuesday, they picked up on Wednesday (and also did some light cleaning so he wouldn't be overcharged by the retirement home ) then they delivered his things to Klamath Falls the very next day!  This company restored my faith in humanity.  They are THE BEST!!!<//text>

<Text>A month ago, I got a new job in San Francisco. I hadn't time to pack all my belongings. I was scrolling on the internet and came across this company. It was easy to book them through the internet for packing and moving ( I am a person who doesn't like to talk on the telephone and really don't have time for this). For me it was the best choice. These guys visited my house and packed and moved all the stuff quickly. I didn’t have to worry about anything. All of my stuff was completely fine after shifting. Thanks to this amazing company.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x80d955c0ba80987f:0xf314874fedeab5da</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Be careful with this company. Half way in the day I found out they picked up a mover from the corner at Home Depot. No qualifications for moving. Then I found out that the lead mover had been convicted for home invasion in his past. Really questionable staff background. Nice manager though.<//Review>

Professional and friendly crew were provided with masks, gloves and sanitizer, it is really important nowadays. Excellent service, quick time and all of this for a really good price! All furniture were covered to exclude any damages.

Alexei was able to schedule us the day that we requested in short notice. He also was patient in answering all of our questions or concerns. When it came to the actual moving, the 3 young men who helped us during the move were super efficient and professional. Would definitely recommend and use again when it comes time for another move.</Review>

Extremely surprised and disappointed with the service received. I called them to move my 1 bedroom apartment which was 5 minutes away to my new one. The movers took 6 AND A HALF HOURS. The mover was hungover and moved very slowly, so when I called Alex "The Owner" of this LLC to talk to him about why I'm being charged $600 (Cash), He stated "You have been talking to me for 15 minutes, do you want me to add this time to your bill too?". The movers told me that he might just have a bad day and wasn't feeling, but that's no way to talk to a customer that recommended your company to three other people. Please stay away and find other moving companies, don't trap your self with this extremely unprofessional company.<//Review>

Second time we used these guys. The first time was okay. Second time wasn’t terrrrrible.... but, they damaged some stuff on the move (no big deal to me) just some scratches and bent things. But they also lost our umbrella. Idk how that happens. I checked our original residence wasn’t there checked all around our new house, wasn’t there either. My wife emailed them two times with no response. So now we have a base and no umbrella. Not a huge deal just super annoyed they never got back to us.

We also had an alcoholic looking dude that seemed extremely out of shape and idk quite a few screws loose. Like the one worker seemed good but the alcoholic dude seemed idk pretty off.

Second time took like 1.5x as long and I moved way more of our stuff myself then the original move. Just was disappointed. Will be using someone else next time.<//text>

We moved our belongings in a POD from out-of-state to Carlsbad. I contacted Alexei with Rhino Moving. It was easy to arrange a Sunday morning move-in and our friendly two-man crew of Andrew and Mo did a great job. We were very satisfied with our Rhino experience.</Text>

<Review>This was the Worst Business Experience in my 74 years of life . . .
We hired Rhino because we were moving from San Diego to Bakersfield & Alex who came to my home to assess our needs which included moving our Street Legal Golf Cart stated that this could be done with No Problem what so ever as they had done this before as stated in the Review I read.
To make a long story short I personally packed Everything myself in boxes so all they had to do was pack & unpack the truck leaving room for the Golf Cart loading last . . .
When they were done they did not leave enough room for the cart. They said they couldn't do it & that is what they were contracted for. They called their boss who told them to Fix It.
They pushed pulled & threw my things everywhere. When they finally stated their was room enough for the cart they Discovered the lift was not long enough for the cart.
Prior to this I had spoken with Alex several times & specifically asked him several times if their lift was long enough to handle the cart I even asked him if he had measured the lift & he again assured me it was No Problem.
After 2 hrs of deliberation & Stupid Hair Brained Ideas like putting the cart sideways on the lift outside the closed door & traveling 4 freeway hrs they got in the Fully Loaded truck on left me there to figure out what to do even though the contract included transporting the cart.
Alex was nowhere to be found & would not answer his phone as he was at a Birthday  Party in Tijuana, Mx & couldn't be bothered.
In the mean time here's a 74 year old woman & her 83 year old husband sitting on the curb. $500 more & several hrs later I found someone to take the cart the next day to Bakersfield.
And the beat goes on, the next day down 2 men from 4 the disaster continued. My new desk was broken in half, our wall unit bed which was also in the contract to be taken apart & put together again looked like something out of Alice In Wonderland & the young Drive/Mover who had been an absolute Disrespectful Terror through the whole process fought me at every turn not wanting to take responsibility or do his job.
I can't even tell you of All the broken things I have encountered in unpacking besides the Desk & Bed.
Bad enough to have to move from your home of 30 years during a pandemic & at our ages, then to have to put up with the Lack of Professionalism & Disrespect as well. I have tried to call Alex & Rhino several times to resolve this issue in some way & They Do Not Answer Or Return My Calls . . .
SO-OOO Sad, what has happened to Customer  Service, Common Decency, Integrity & Respect?
By the way this company is a contractor for Allied . . .

I want to give Rhino Moving 5 stars, but unfortunately due to one of the workers not wearing a mask, I am giving them four stars. He asked me if I had one for him to use, I, unfortunately, ran out of disposable masks. Rhino Moving should be supplying them with an endless supply of masks, especially since we are in the most restrictive purple tier! I think it was unprofessional to show up unprepared; it would have been considerate if they stopped at a store on the way to pick up a mask instead of asking me for one.</review>

I am currently 7 1/2 months pregnant at the time of the move and my husband was away for work. I hired this company to move my 2 bedroom home. They arrived on time but the day quickly went astray. I honestly felt like they were trying to take advantage of me being alone during the move. The movers on that day had only been working for the company for 2 weeks per his own words. Although one of the managers assured me that he had "moving experience". They moved very slow and did not have a plan for the move which resulted in wasting time during the move and a charge of excess hours. It was not until I mentioned the time, that the movers decided to "work faster". They were stated to have moved a 3 bedroom in 6 hours however could not move all of my belongs in the 8+ hours that was attempting to be charged to me. They did not move all of the items that were at the previous house and did not complete the move. They did not offer any assistance other than to call Law Enforcement when I disputed the amount being charged to me. The movers damaged the front door at my previous place as well as damaging the wall at the new place. When the damages were brought up their response was "its not that bad". The movers also took apart my bed frame and agreed to put it back together at the new place. However they left bolts for the bed at the old place and was unable to put the bed together. Instead of fixing the bed or finding the parts that they had no idea were missing, they blamed myself and my furniture for having defects when it indeed did not. The movers then left the bed in pieces. I was told by the apparent owner that someone would come the following morning to fix the bed. The morning after, no one showed up and my phone calls were being sent to the voicemail. I left a voicemail and no one returned my phone call. I also sent an email regarding the issue but again, no one returned my inquiry. They also left the hookups for my washer and dryer at the previous place and blamed me for being cautious of time and thats why they left them. They constantly talked in another language and when asked to speak English so I could follow the conversation, they ignored my request. When I asked for a receipt of payment they refused and did not verify payment. After all this there is more that went wrong with the day but it goes without saying DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY. ITS A RIP OFF AND THEY WILL BECOME COMPLETELY UNRESPONSIVE THE MOMENT SOMETHING GOES WRONG.< /text>

UPDATED JANUARY 2021

On our latest move out of our Cortez Hill apartment, Alexis and team have been very fast and efficient, as always. The crew is always in communication with us, asking important questions about placement of items, protecting our desks with blankets and pallet wrap, etc. The crew all wore masks throughout the pickup and drop off (and properly!) As I said in my original review, you could not ask for a better team to move you and your belongings from A to Z.

*************

My wife and I were very impressed with Alexei and his crew at Rhino Movers on a recent move to Cortez Hill. With us moving from Boston to San Diego and using a POD to do so, we were concerned about adding a moving company into the mix. Alexei put us at ease with his detailed explanation of the process and responsiveness on emails with our questions. He was very easy to work with and his crew on the day of the move were quick, efficient, and communicative on placements of larger items. We cannot say enough about the professionalism of Alexei's operation and his staff. The entire process was seamless from start to finish. We would recommend Rhino Movers to anyone moving in San Diego County and plan to use them on any future moves in the area.< /review></record>

<text>Moving is never fun, but Rhino Movers made it not only made it easier, they moved fast, and didn't cost us an arm and a leg.  They gave us regular time updates, treated all our items as if they were own, and were extremely efficient at their job.  They were so good, that I had to remind them to breathe and take water breaks.  If you need movers, I highly recommend going with them.</text></record></dataset><record>

This is the second time I have moved with Rhino. Alex, the owner, and Vlad and his crew were great to work with. This move was a tough move and required that the truck be unloaded at street level and then carried or dollied up a tree canopied driveway to the top of the hill. Alex, personally, help me plan this complicated move in advance. He stayed in touch with me leading up to moving day and throughout the move. Tough job!!! The movers hustled the whole time working hard to save me money. They took great care my furniture (much of it very heavy), wrapping every piece as they went. I will never need to call any moving company but Rhino and have referred many my friends and contacts. Moving is stressful and it's great to have quality people you can count on to get the job done.</text>

We were very satisfied with their services and highly recommend.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

March 2019 local move ( about 1 mile) great experience: on time, relevant knowledge and skills, listened to customer preferences, effective wrapping of furniture with recyclable /  reusable materials, careful with your things and your buildings, time efficient, familiar with South of Market / Mission Bay buildings, and their requirements.</Text>

<Review>Chris and Matthew we're very courteous and efficient, especially considering that they had to move all our stuff up to the third floor via stairs! Also was really glad that Rhino was able to schedule our move last minute - the day before - as our previous plans fell through. They were quick to respond to my inquiry and the quote process was straight forward. Thanks Rhino!<//Review>< pics>

<Review>I asked for a 3-person team because the old place was a 2+2 condo on three levels.  They showed up on time, introduced themselves, walked through the old place with me and then dove into the job.  At the new place (2+1, single level), everything was delivered to the appropriate rooms and things that had been disassembled were reassembled.  Less than 5 hours start to finish.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80d955c0ba80987f:0xf314874fedeab5da<//gmapID></record>

<review>I've moved several times and have to say Rhino was by far the best moving company I've ever had the pleasure of working with! The staff is very professional was attentive to my needs. Prior to the move they came to my residence "on a Saturday" reviewed all of my items and provided an accurate estimate the same day! They provided full packaging service as well and arrived early Sunday morning with a full crew to do so. I was amazed at how professional they were in handling my belongings ever so carefully. My items where wrapped and stored in boxes for the next crew to receive. All of my furniture was wrapped with blankets and again in plastic. The carpeting, walls and surrounds where very well protected as well. The following day the next crew arrived early and on time! They moved everything to the truck and in no time and we were off. Upon arrival to my new home they assembled all of my beds, furniture and alike, unpacked my clothing and other items. I was able to comfortably settle in to my new place with easy. I highly recommend Rhino to anyone looking for a reputable, experienced and professional moving service!</review>< pictures>

<Date>1481833831740< /Date><Rate>5<//Rate><text>After a week of packing and being completely stressed out, I am happy to say that Rhino Moving, LLC made the day of our move super easy.  It was the first time I could sit for an extended period of time in weeks without feeling guilty.  This move from San Diego to Los Angeles is the furthest I've ever moved.

Going back to the beginning, the estimate staff was helpful and knowledgeable.  They were the only ones that did an in house estimate out of all of the companies we contacted, and it paid off.  When the estimator, Addison , said that we would have around 60 boxes, we thought he was crazy - but he was so right!  They do this for a living, I definitely do not.

The morning of our move, the team of 4 called me about half an hour before arriving to our apartment. Blake walked through our apartment, noting which items were and were not ours, as we have a roommate who was not moving out.  For the rest of the time, I sat at the kitchen table and answered a few short questions of whether something was ours or not.  They took great care with our items, and wrapped everything securely.  Boxes and bins that I had already taped up, were taped more securely, and all of our furniture, artwork, and lamps were taken care of with their materials (included in our quote).

So happy with the decision we made.<//text>< pics>

Good price. Showed up on time. Didn't lag or delay. No damage to items or walls. Worked quickly in the rain. Only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 was because One of the movers said he couldn't fit everything  in one load and tried to say he'd have to come back (more mileage +more time=more $), but the other moved named  "V" made the effort to fit it all in one load-much  Appreciated!!!</review>

<review>We could not have done our move without them! Our moving team:  Noe, Dimitrii and Victor R. were so AWESOME. They moved our three bedroom home in a day, and they maintained such a positive attitude the WHOLE time! These guys worked so hard, and also made sure there was no damage done to any of our property. Best movers in San Diego. The front end office, especially Addison, was prompt to answer all my questions and put us at ease leading up to our move! Timely, responsible, and friendly! I highly recommend Rhino Moving!</review>< userid>

Shawn and Vladimir were amazing during our recent move. They were totally flexible, and willing to problem-solve for some items that had been packed strangely (i.e. not in boxes). They were so helpful and quick, and got the job done well fast. We had them move us into a storage unit, and will definitely be hiring them again when we move out of it!< /text>

This is the second time I have used this company and both times they were excellent. On time, cost effective, friendly, efficient, and no problems, they knew what they were doing. They took great care to take care of my belongings. They had the right size truck and the right amount of people. Both times were a great experience. I highly recommend them.<//text>

Best move experience I have had from start to finish.  The guys were professional, efficient, talented, upfront and very careful with our stuff.   Even when the location we were moving made it difficult they just kept on going, getting it done as quickly as they could.  They were trying to work for us the whole time.  And Addison in the office is GREAT!!</review>

Wow, I am so impressed with Alex and Rhino Moving!

I was desperate when I called. It was the last day of the month, it was already noon, on the last day of our lease, and my scheduled movers had been in an accident, and were not going to make it. I am really glad they didn't, as it gave me a chance to use Rhino Moving.

Jonathon and Kendall were sent to the rescue! The men arrived ready to work, with great big smiles on their faces! They went quickly through the move, wasting no time whatsoever, but not so fast that anything was harmed!  It was so wonderful to work with two men who completely understood the stress of moving, and made this a very easy, painless, 5-star move.

Thank you Kendall and Jonathon. Handsome and really outstanding movers...great job guys!!

A total pleasure to do business with Rhino Moving. I can recommend them highly, would give them 6 stars if I could, and will use them again without reservation. Do yourself a favor. Hire these guys. They are true professionals in every sense of the word.</review>

Really great experience. Needed to schedule a move on short notice. Kendall, Jesse and Mike arrived on time and were excellent, taking great care of our family heirloom furniture. They even got our golf cart onto the truck. They were polite, courteous and got the job done right. Thanks guys!< /Text>

Blake and Francisco helped make our move seamless.  Thank you.  As a military family we wanted a company that could help us with a long distance move and from the professionalism of working with Addison in the office with the scheduling... to the delivery... we had a great experience.  Rhino's prices were affordable and they took care of us.< /Text>

< Review>
Wow, was beyond happy with the service we received from Rhino Moving, LLC. We decided to use them for a move from San Diego and it all went super smoothly. Though the move was 500 miles, delivery occurred very shortly in our window and we were very pleased.

1)  This guy was so accommodating of the many many changes we had along the process and was always quick about updating our inventory and providing advice. Great customer service from Addison

2) We had a ton of pain in the ass changes regarding our delivery thanks to a very unaccommodating destination apartment, and Alex was great about being able to adjust for these changes and keeping us updated.

3) San Diego pack up crew WOW, these guys were awe-inspiring. Very quick, very professional, handled all of our inventory with respect and were nothing but courteous. They were in and out in under 2 hours. The fact that our goods made it 500 miles with ZERO damage is a testament to their packing skills. They are a true asset to the company, they really bust ass for their employer.

Thank you much Rhino Moving, LLC

Would do business with them again.< /Review>

After living in our home for 40 years we had the opportunity to move to another beautiful home. The move was not easy as we lived in a two story home on a steep driveway and the new home had three levels. Rhino was VERY good. Their staff is courteous and no task is too heavy or too cumbersome. It was a pleasure to see how they work as a team. Because of a family emergency we had to stop the two day move after one day and continue later. Alex was very understanding and made the adjustments very easy. I had five estimates for the move and Rhino was very competitive. It is expected there may be some minor scratches on furniture, but there only a couple on ours. I highly recommend Rhino. They are worth every penney and deserve a 5 star rating!</text>

<Review>Worst movers I’ve ever used.  One of the movers dropped a large top piece off of our 3 piece wall unit and it hit our 60” flat screen TV causing damage to the TV.  The mover argued with me about hitting the TV.  He told me that he didn’t hit the TV which I replied yes you did I saw you.  He then still tried to argue with me about hitting the TV.  Our TV is ruined now.  When I called to report the broken TV I had to leave a voice mail which no one returned.  I called several times and got the voicemail box.  Which once again none of my calls were returned.  When I finally got ahold of Alex because I called again and he told me he would check with his workers and get back to me the next day.  Again Alex never called me back.  I gave him a few days to call me back and of course he never called.  So I start leaving voicemails again without getting any response from Alex.  After a couple of weeks I finally got a live person on the phone who told me to send an email regarding the TV.  Well just like all my phone calls I didn’t get a response to my email.  I called today and actually got to talk to Alex.  He told me that the insurance company would only reimburse us $60.  Now keep in mind Alex never called me to let me know they could only reimburse us $60, I had to call him to get that information.  His explanation for not returning any of my calls was that they are very busy.  When I booked them for the move Alex returned my call the very next day to schedule our move.  He also called to confirm that we still wanted them to move us a week or so prior to our move, but never called us back about our TV.  I asked to speak with a supervisor and he said that he was the supervisor.  So I asked him to give me their corporate office.  He told me they didn’t have one and that he is the owner of the company.’ He told me I had to call their insurance company to further discuss being reimbursed.  I asked him if he was the owner of the company that he should be able to handle the situation.So I asked him if they  had a CEO which he replied saying that they didn’t have a CEO only he used letters that sounded like CEO, but not CEO.  So I asked him if he even knew what a CEO was and instead of answering my question he hung up on me.  WOW WHAT A GREAT BUSINESS OWNER.  I guess they only want to talk to you or help you out when you’re going to pay them thousands of dollars to move you and when something gets broke you’re just out of luck.  I guess when you move over 400 miles away from San Diego they don’t feel the need to answer or return calls regarding damages.  I guess they feel like they are never going to see you walk into there office because of the distance.  So they just don’t return your calls I’m guessing because they think they will never see you in person and that you will eventually stop calling as well.  Well guess again Alex.  Oh and he was real quick to spout out $60 is all the insurance company will pay.  So if he got that information why didn’t Alex call me and tell me instead of me having to call.  Since he hung up on me I guess I will have to all back about being reimbursed.  This is such a horrible way to run a business and treat customers.  I wouldn’t recommend this moving company for anything.  They probably couldn’t move a bottle of ketchup from one table to another in a dinning establishment without breaking the bottle.  I bet they would expect you to clean up and pay for the broken bottle and also say that they didn’t even touch the ketchup bottle.  Worst customer service ever and they have no problem lying to you.  Save yourself the grief and hire some junior high kids.  I bet they would conduct themselves in a more professional way than Rhino.</Review><rating>1<//rating>< Pics>

I booked a last minute move from my office to my home and they were happy to accommodate me.  They arrived early, came with all the necessary supplies and equipment (nice clean and new model truck), and were quick and efficient.  Reasonably priced, and didn't charge an inflated rate for a weekend move, like other companies wanted to.  Getting the proof of insurance required by my office building management was also not a problem.  Friendly and professional - I would definitely use them again, and recommend them to others.</text>< pictures>

Second time that I've used Rhino moving and received EXCELENT service.
Their prices are extremely competitive and reasonable, with NO HIDDEN FEES!
Alex the owner personally saw to my move and was extremely quick without risking the safety of my belongings.
Highly recommend using them for any size move.</Review>

<Review>Extremely disappointed with the service here. I've moved numerous times and this by far has been the WORST experience.  I moved last Friday and have discovered at least 5 pieces of furniture damaged from the move. I just saw my dining table have a huge gash on top. Earlier this week, we saw 2 of our beds damaged, a vanity table and bookshelf.  The damages aren't even small, it's as if the movers took no care at all! It was a 10 mile move that should've been fairly easy. Do not use this company! We complained to the manager and he came by and dropped off a furniture marker! The damages aren't little scuffs, they are huge!<//Review>< GmapID>

He was helpful over the phone and gave a reasonable quote and was able to book us for a busy holiday weekend without a problem. The moving day went so smoothly, we were a little shocked at how well it went. The crew, ​Kendall, Vadim and Anuar, worked quickly and efficiently. We were impressed with the care they took in wrapping all of our furniture to prevent damages, and the had no problem with all the outdoor and workout equipment we had in our garage. Highly recommend!< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

<Review>We had a great experience using staff from Rhino Moving as labor for an event we hosted. We needed extra help moving boxes and furniture throughout a huge hotel and they were so helpful. They did anything we asked, brought plenty of equipment and were very responsive to last minute requests and needs. I'd recommend them for any moving needs!< /Review>< pictures>

Note that there is a 3-hour minimum.  My brother also used them for his move, and he was very happy with them.<//review><name>Jim Sung</name></record>

From the moment they arrived they hustled and kept reminding me to sit back and relax. I'm used to doing half the work. They had my 2 bedroom apartment emptied in no time. They arrived at my new home within five minutes of me (I'm used to the movers disappearing for an on the clock lunch break). They finished the job 25% faster then I had guesstimated it would take and not a single item was damaged (including my curved tv!!). 5 of 5. Request Danny and Leo.<//Text>< Pics>

<Text>I am a senior citizen, and this is the first time I have been on my own in a move.  I was expecting problems, but there were none!  Rhino Moving is the best, and Mihai, Sardor and Leo are amazing!  I was surprised at the care with which my possessions were handled.  Mihai, Sardor and Leo were friendly and professional, and their service was nothing short of phenomenal. I now reside in a senior citizen community, and I have recommended Rhino Moving to both management and tenants.  Thank you, Rhino Moving!<//Text>< Time>

We are currently in the process of opening our family restaurant "Alfonso's of La Jolla in Solana Beach.  We hired Rhino Moving to help us transport our new kitchen equipment from downtown to our new location.  Alex the owner has being amazing from the very first time I called him to inquire about his services and his rates.  Before he picked up the equipment, he visited the store where the equipment was bought and spoke to the general manager to square away all the details before the pick up date. Days before the delivery, Alex came by our restaurant to see were he would be loading off the equipment as well as, checking out which entrance the equipment would be brought in the building.  The delivery of the equipment went better than we expected.  Once the truck arrived on site, the crew new exactly what to do. I give Alex and his crew 5 stars for their amazing service and professionalism. Thank You Alex<//Review>

First off they broke the water line to the washer behind the wall and had to shutdown the main to the house for two days until the plumbers could come and repair the line, that cost me $450.00 plus repair to the wall. They continued to destroy about $8000.00 worth of art work, neon signs and furniture, Plus banging into the walls everywhere! DO NOT USE THEM!< /Review>

But in today's I felt a positive and compassionate vibe from everyone at south bay family dental. I was greeted by probably the best receptionist, Elaine. She was so kind and made me feel at ease and welcomed.  Brian, was awesome, very professional,  and genuinely concerned of my comfort.  Then, Dr. Lee, took his time working on me and was very thorough explaining my health.  He is a Navy Veteran and I thank him for his service then,  and for his continued service to us. I had an extraordinary and pleasant experience, thank you!<//review>< pics>

I recently moved here from out of state and needed a new dentist. I’m so glad to have found Dr. Lee and his team! They got me in quickly for my first appointment and took X-rays, did my exam, and my cleaning all in about an hour. They were very professional and their customer service was superb (thanks Elaine and Brian!). I was so impressed that I’ve already scheduled my Nov cleaning. I also plan to bring my family here for their dental needs when they move to San Diego this summer!< /Text>

I looked for a dentist within the options of my insurance [tricare] and I picked Dr. Lee based in my last dentist who was also Korean (NJ), best decision ever!
Did a cleaning and a filling exchange with Dr. Lee, came back for remove some old resine. He is excellent professional, very polite and confident. His work is amazing, my teeth looks great and his crew is also very good. Price is very fair. Highly recommend Dr. LEE, totally worth it the ride from SD to Imperial Beach.<//text>

<response>None< /response><Time>1611002660748< /Time><rating>5< /rating><review>I want first to state that my experience at this dentistry was great. I am often anxious to visit a dentist's office—especially when it is a new one during a global pandemic. However, the staff at this office took my worries away. Upon arrival, Elaine welcomed me in, took my temperature, sanitized my shoes, and gave me a protective hairnet. Elaine was so kind and quickly checked me in before Brian took my x-rays. I mentioned to Brian that I was a little nervous, but he was very understanding. At the start of each procedure, he explained what would happen and regularly checked in with me. Next I met Dr. Lee, who was patient and compassionate. I was able to ask him all of my questions and never felt rushed or ignored. He was great at simply and clearly informing me of which steps to take next. In the end, Elaine walked me out, both of us chatting along the way. Overall great staff and environment—I hope I can revisit them!</review>< Pics>

<text>I cannot say enough positive things about this dental practice. Dr Lee and staff are truly caring with unique needs/fears  Dr. Lee is a perfectionist - yet - does not charge for something you do not need. Hi staff, Louisiana and Elaine have always been the most friendly of folks - actually remember who you are - not just a number or client.< /text><gmap_id>0x80d94c1125e21c83:0x3a06bf2297effd83< /gmap_id><Resp>None<//Resp>< pics>

The dental services here were amazing. It has been many years since I have been to a dentist due to bad root canals that lead to multiple tooth extractions. I had cracked my tooth way back in March right when the pandemic hit. I ignored it because it never hurt, but last week I was in so much pain I couldn't even sleep. So I called them up and hesitantly scheduled an appointment. Everyone there was very nice and professional. Elaine made me feel so comfortable while I waited to be seen. Brian and Luisana were calming and so professional as they prepped me and took x-rays. And when the tooth was removed I felt no pain at all. The Dr was able to remove it in one go without it breaking further. After I got home I was finally able to sleep. I would highly recommend them to anyone who has a bad experience with dentist before.< /Text>

Always a great experience here! Shout out to Dr. Lee, Elaine, Luisana, and Brian. Staff is always incredibly helpful, constantly asking if I’m in pain during the procedure. Truly make you feel like family here. They even worked with me scheduling my procedures to accommodate my insurance coverage.<//Review>

First time coming to south bay family dental and this has to be one of the best and friendliest dental office I’ve ever been to in my life. Luisana and Elaine were so friendly that it felt like I’ve known them for years. Dr. Lee was also very friendly and professional. 10/10 I recommend this place!

My experience at South Bay family dental has been an A plus or 10 out of 10. Dr Lee was very informative regarding my situation, which is unique due to the fact that I just completed chemotherapy and radiation. Elaine helped me tremendously regarding my appointments and scheduling. She goes above and beyond her regular duties.  Luisana who is responsible for taking X-rays and seating you in the dental chair was great. She completed her duties with me in a minimal amount of time and advised Dr Lee that I was ready, and he came to the room immediately. All in all it was a very good experience and the entire staff at South Bay family dentistry deserve kudos.</review>

I recently switched to Dr. Lee after having been with another dentist for over 30 years. I have been very relieved to find such expertise in my neighborhood. The entire support staff (Elaine, Luisana and Brian) are warm and professional. As a senior, I appreciate Elaine escorting me to my car after sessions and the cautions taken re Covid.<//Text>

Dr. Lee and staff did an excellent job with my wisdom teeth extraction. The follow up appointment was quick and easy! Elaine is great and welcoming as soon as you open the door! They are happy to answer any questions you may have. The whole experience was literally painless and I am healing nicely~ Thank you all.

*Also, I am very pleased with the practice's response to COVID-19 guidelines (temp checks, etc.) for both their staff and clients!</review>

<review>Highly recommend!!
Phenomenal is how I can describe my service and attention at South Bay Family Dental. Even during these times of Covid. They took all precautions, treated me like a long time patient (it was my first time), were very attentive to my needs, made me feel safe and comfortable. I had a dental emergency and they saw me that same day and resolved the issue. All staff members were very nice! All costs where transparent and doctor was very clear about his procedure. No hidden fees! I paid cash and did not want to use my insurance. They do take insurance but I didn’t want to hassle with it. I needed the tooth out! My comfort and pain level was managed to perfection. I even received a call after to check in on me. After my years of dental trauma... this has been a corrective experience for sure! Thank you All!< /review>< user_id>

<Text>I want to thank Dr. Lee, Elaine, Luisana, and Brian. This was my first visit here and when I have to have any dental work done I get anxiety. They did a great job of taking my mind off of my fears and made sure I felt no pain before beginning the procedure. My whole family has been coming to this office and highly recommended South Bay Family Dental to me. Im happy I came into their office and actually look forward to getting the work I need done here.

<Review>Recently started coming to this office after several negative experiences at other locations. I was tempted to prove for myself the reviews were real! I can definitely agree with everyone that has mentioned the exceptional service by Elaine and Luisana. Along with Dr. Lee and Bryan, they go above and beyond to make my family’s visits very comfortable and pleasant. I’m glad we decided to make the change and lucky to have them so close to home :)<//Review>< Gmap_id>

<Text>excellent service from the moment I called! Very friendly ladies working in the front, very helpful!! They make you feel like you've known them forever even if its your first time there! My husband needed an emergency extraction and once we got home they still called to check up on him and see how he was doing! Definitely recommending this dental office to all of our family & friends! We definitely found our dentist for good! Elaine & luisana in the front, thank you for being so friendly and being on top of everything!</Text>< pictures>

<text>Amazing staff, super friendly, family oriented and just great people!

Got my daughter in for an emergency walk in with a cracked tooth with no issues.  They ensured she was calm and not scared and assisted with the removal.

Only 1 week later they seen my 3 kids all back to back with overly zealous smiles and friendly attitudes.  They were so kind and friendly and playful with the kids.  All the kids were deathly afraid before going and after their visit they were begging to go back and claiming how much they loved the dentist.  This was All attributed to Dr. Lee and his amazing staff.  Thank you South Bay for changing my kids minds for the better and being so friendly.  We will definitely continue to return and use you as our friendly family dentist<//text>< user_name>

I've been super over the dentist after a few shady ones but this is BY FAR the best dentist I've seen. The care taken is beyond compare. Dude! I gotta root canal and they checked up to see how I was doing later that day!! I don't feel like a customer, I feel like family. My kids love them too. 10 stars if I could. Elaine and the crew are epic and deserve your biz. Mad Love!<//text>

<Text>I am truly grateful to have found this dental clinic. I had called earlier this year (Jan 2020) looking to have extractions & treatment for my four wisdom teeth that were giving me pain. I spoke to Louisa, who was so kind yet saddened to tell me that they were not currently open due to CoVid19. She followed up with me 2 weeks prior to their confirmed reopening in May to set my appointment. When arriving to the clinic , I was greeted by Elaine, who made me feel welcome and comfortable. My appointment with Dr. Li & Brian went well each time. They were constantly informing me on the health of my teeth with every step they took. They were also very considerate with my pain level which I appreciate. Their teamwork, technique & precision made me feel 100% confident in the treatment I was receiving. I recommend this dental clinic to all my friends & family.< /Text>< gmap_id>

What a great family place. They clearly care about their patients and what everything to be comfortable. DR. Lee is very knowledgeable, Eileen and the whole front reception lives what they do and they prepared everything very quick. I was in and out very fast and the whole process was comfortable. GIVE THIS PLACE A VISIT!!
I promise you it’ll be your new dentist, because it is for me.</review>

Best dental experience I've ever had. The staff is more than welcoming and create for a calm and non intimidating environment. Communication is clear and direct through the entire visit making for a easy process.

Highly recommend. The staff are consistent creating great comfort and have your best interest in mind always. Again the environment is very welcoming and everyone carries themselves with great positive attitudes, clearing any fears or intimidations one might have about the dentist.</Review>

They are so amazing ! They walk you through everything they are doing and they check to make sure you’re doing okay while they are working on your pearly whites. I hadn’t gone to the dentist in about 10 years because of prior bad experiences but they turned it completely around. Now I feel more obliged to take better care of my teeth because I know I have a solid team taking care of me :))</review>

This dentist is by far the best dentist we have been to in San Diego! As soon as we walked in the door for first visit we were greeted with smiles and treated like family! My kids were nervous about their cleaning and were immediately at ease! Elaine is so kind and absolutely amazing! Luisana was so caring and patient with my daughter and Brian really took good care of my son. Dr. Lee was caring and honest and my 10 year old said he could not wait to go back next week! We have found the “Best Dentist Ever” and felt very well taken care off! Will recommend this place to everyone we know!< /Text>

My wife recommended South Bay Dental. On my first visit I was thoroughly impressed with all  the staff I encountered.  For someone who avoids the dentist, my visit was pleasant.  So pleasant that I decided to have the whitening procedure.  Luisana, who performed the procedure, was professional, courteous, and friendly.  She explained everything step by step, and kept me informed of our progress.  The end result exceeded my expectations and therefore, I recommend this dental office to all.....</Text>

<text>Semi-new to the practice. I picked it because it was close to home but staying because of the great customer service and great care from Dr. Lee & staff. Elaine and Luisana are caring and friendly. Easy to schedule appointment within reason and they even called me to come in sooner when they had a last minute cancellation, because they knew I was in pain. I didn’t even ask them to do that. Dr. Lee is gentle and cares about his patients.< /text><Resp>None</Resp><UserId.>116951053015186966552<//UserId.>< pictures>

What a great team here at South Bay Family Dental! The front desk is so sweet I had an emergency root canal needed and they got me in the next day! Elaine and Luisana are so sweet and their work is very much professional. No problems yet with the root canal, I have a couple appointments left but they make going to the dentist fun and exciting!!< /review>

Dr. Lee, Luicana, Elaine, and Brian are amazing. The passion for what they do shows in the way they treat each patient. I have high anxiety when it comes to dental work. I didn't experience as much with this office. Everyone makes you feel so at ease and make sure you are comfortable at all times.  I feel like I built a relationship with all of the staff. Brian has such good bedside manner and such a calming tone to his voice. My extraction was a breeze! Thank you guys so much for giving me my first good experience at a dental office at the age of 40!</text>

Dr. Lee and his staff are phenomenal! Very warm and welcoming. They make you feel at ease and knowledgeable about what work needs done prior to just giving you a bill. My family comes to this office and will continue to do so 💜<//review>

Really kind people, they make you feel welcomed. It makes you feel more relaxed when your about to go in to your appointment. They are really nice and keep up with you after they have done a teeth removal to see how you are feeling. Their installations are really clean and family friendly. I am a new patient and I was really satisfied with their services.< /Text>

I was reluctant to switch dentists at first, but I wish I had taken this step sooner. Doctor Lee lived up to all of my expectations and then some. He showed a genuine interest and concern about my recurring tooth pain. And the best part is that he was able to diagnose and treat my problem on my first visit. Thank you Doctor Lee and staff for your highly professional work and level of care!</text>

<Text>Generally, I hate the dentist but Luisa, Elaine, and Dr. Lee gave me a wonderful experience at South Bay Dental. The office was clean, staff was ready for me as soon as I arrived for my appointment even though I was 15 minutes early. Dr. Lee and the hygienist were sure to make sure I was comfortable and in no pain for the duration of my exam and cleanings—and I was able to get an affordable quote on my fillings. If you’re looking to switch dentists, South Bay Dental is a great choice.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x80d94c1125e21c83:0x3a06bf2297effd83< /GmapID></record>

I'd like to thank Dr. Lee & and his amazing staff (Elaine and Luisana) for welcoming me into their establishment with open arms. South Bay Dental has provided excellent service to my family for the last four years and we've never thought about going elsewhere.

I was nervous at first when I arrived to the office. Elaine and Luisiana were very attentive and comforting while I waited for Dr. Lee to extract my tooth. Both Dr. Lee and Luisiana were thorough in explaining the procedure to me and aftercare. I would happily recommend this office to anyone who is looking for a good and gentle dentist. Thank you so much Dr. Lee you helped me so much. No more pain.</review>

I have had the good fortune of having Dr. Lee as my dentist since 2006. The hospitality and care that I receive from not only him, but his office staff as well is beyond words. They don't treat me like just some patient, they treat me like family. Dr. Lee always provides me with the best dental care. He is understanding and compassionate. Elaine, Luisana and Brian are the best! They make me feel so comfortable and are always on top of answering any questions or concerns. I would definitely recommend this dental office to anyone and everyone!</text>

This review is for my mother, who doesn't get online much. Dr. Lee was recommended by a friend. My mother says she is very pleased with the good fortune of having chosen this clinic. She and my father had, for years, gone south of the border for dental care. We convinced her to try here. She regrets not having met Dr. Lee sooner! Though her treatment is not done, we are off to a great start. She is pleased with his patience and good care. The entire staff is welcoming. She would not hesitate to recommend him to family or friends.< /Review>

What a great experience my daughter and I had visiting South Bay Family Dental in IB. The staff was amazing. Elaine talked with my the entire time my daughter was getting her wisdom teeth out making sure I was comfortable. Luisana and Doctor Lee were great with my daughter. I could hear them talking with her making sure she was comfortable. Highly recommend them. 😊< /review>

I went to this office to get a second opinion about my teeth/gum condition. Dr.Lee was very nice and explained to me how the cleaning and prevention procedure works. Luisana, Elaine  and also assistant guy were also very kind and made me feel very comfortable. I've been looking for a good dental office which is also affordable and have a clean office and I FOUND ONE. I totally recommend this office to anyone!!!
Thank you South bay family dental!!!<//Review>

This whole team is beyond amazing, Dr Lee is so professional and really good at his work. Elaine is like an angel in scrubs, so nice and always concerned with each patient that walks through the door. Everyone in the office carries themselves with a level of professionalism while also making you feel like you’re amongst family. Best dental office in San Diego County !!< /Review>

Dr Lee was recommended by a friend and I've been to see him for a couple years now. My sensitive teeth don't bother me anymore and his work is remarkably painless. His assistants Elaine, Luisana, and Ryan are very pleasant. Never a problem with billing to insurances and no rework needed. I highly recommend using South Bay Family Dental.

Well, I posted the following about a year ago and I just got back from my latest visit. Now the only change that I would make to the review below is to make it more enthusiastic and add at least 3 more stars. Coming here is like coming home for the holidays. Warm, smiling, friendly faces greet you in the waiting room until you are escorted into treatment area. There you meet a charming and efficient Dr Lee and his associate who preform the required treatments with speed and smiles. I can not say too much about this organization.
===========================================
I recently moved down to this area and faced one of the hardest decisions one has to make: I had to choose a new dentist. Based on the reviews I read here, I decided to give South Bay Family Dental a shot.

After going there, I couldn't have been more satisfied. The staff was friendly, courteous, and attentive. Everyone I dealt with was knowledgeable and carried out their duties with speed and efficiency.

So, if you're trying to choose a new dentist, you can't go wrong here.< /Review>

I visited Dr Bruce Lee's office today and was requested to make a review for this dental office.
I have nothing but great experiences while seeing Dr Lee, an excellent and gentle dentist. His team was great. Listens to what I have to say, answers, recommends and explains everything all the procedures and everything that needs to be done in a very efficient and professional manner. This team is the best I've seen and I will continue to come here with my dental problems and would highly recommend them to anyone. Way to go team....</Review>

I had so many major work and surgery done in the past. I feel like most dentists are like car salesman but Dr. Lee is very genuine and caring. I had my teeth checked and cleaned by him (most dentist has hygienist do it). I also consult the office about bleaching my teeth! Their price is so reasonable (half price from other dentist). I already make an appointment for my teeth whitening. So thankful to find a dentist who cares. Thank you Dr. Lee and his staff.</Review>< user_name>

<Text>Simply the best dental care in San Diego. Elaine and Luisana are the sweetest people. Dr Bruce Lee will give the best information for dental care rather you need serious work or simple maintenance. You can make an appointment the same day or week. Give them a call today so that can have your nice and white smile.< /Text><pics>None</pics>< response>

This office is a great place to get dental work. Dr.Lee and his staff are very friendly and they see you as a person not as a patient. Elaine and Luisana were top notch! They made me experience a good time. Even the dental hygienist was very excellent. Always making sure that I was doing okay while getting work done on my teeth. I highly recommend going here if you are looking for a good place to get dental work!< /review>

<rate>5< /rate><review>After several bad experiences with Western Dental, I was skeptical about finding a dentist that truly cared for their patients.  I decided to give South Bay dental a try, and was pleasantly surprised when I walked into the office and wasn’t treated like a dollar sign or fast food customer. Elaine was very friendly and made me feel like I was part of the family.  Louisiana was funny and professional while conducting my X-rays. Dr. Lee was very thorough and  ensured I was comfortable during my procedures.  As a Navy Vet myself I enjoyed talking to him about our Navy experiences. My search for a dentist for me and my family is over, South Bay dental has won me over.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x80d94c1125e21c83:0x3a06bf2297effd83<//gmap_id></record>

I highly recommend this dentist! They always have a smile on their face and are happy to help me with any questions and/or concerns I have. It was my first time going to the dentist in over 5 years and they worked with me and let me know what needed to be done! Dr Lee always makes sure I am comfortable when he’s working on my teeth. If you’re looking for a family friendly and great dentist they’re the ones! ☺️ Elaine and luisana are the best with welcoming me and making sure my days going great and reminding me of my appointments! ☺️ Once again I HIGHLY recommend South Bay family dental group!< /review>

The whole team is awesome here. They’re honest and I don’t feel they’re trying to get unnecessary services out of me and my family. Dr. Lee and Louisiana always makes me feel comfortable before starting. Elaine is so welcoming, she makes us feel like family here.</Text>

Also, the dentist Dr. Lee is extremely professional and takes the time to get to know you as a person, not just his income. And his assistant Luisana is also amazing, very funny always keeping it light. If you have to see a dentist, this is the place. 100%<//text>< user_id>

<Review>I called late last night (Sunday) to schedule an emergency appointment for today as my boyfriend had a severe toothache for 5 days.   We are from out of the area but he is working in the Chula Vista area during the week.  The office called me as soon as they opened Monday morning and was able to get him in right away.  The scheduler was super friendly and thorough giving directions on their exact location. Luisana  and Elaine were very professional and friendly ladies.  I am so glad we found a nice dental
Office that was able to get us in working around his busy work schedule and get this tooth problem taken care of right away.  He had to have an extraction and it was quick and easy and he feels so much relief now that it is out. Will definetly be going to this office again! I will be recommending to everyone I know!</Review>< pics>

I’ve been taking my big babies to Dr. Lee and staff for a few years.  Elaine is always so welcoming upon arriving.  Her smile and sincerity helps reassure my kids that they are in good hands.  Luisana works great along Dr. Lee’s side.  They both make sure to let my kids know what they are doing and to make sure they are comfortable.  Great office all around!</Review>

This practice was recommended to me by a friend's father who is a dental surgeon. Dr. Bruce Lee and all the staff is always so kind and welcoming. They really make sure you know exactly what's going on in the chair and behind the scenes (with insurance, etc). If you want a personalized visit and to be known by name and face, definitely come here!<//text>

<review>South Bay Dental delivered the best dental care and customer service experience for our entire family.
Elaine at reception, and Luisana who works with Dr. Lee always went above and beyond, making sure our questions were answered, our insurance billing was correct,and never failed to follow up and check on us after procedures such as extractions or root canals. They are some of the kindest, most caring people ever.
Getting dental work was so much easier because of them.
Dr. Lee did a beautiful job with cosmetic dental work, and we have shiny, white, healthy smiles because of it.
Thank you all so much!<//review>< user_name>

In all my life, I have never had a Dental Practice who makes you feel like Family! I had such a fear of Dentists, but they soon put that fear to rest. Dr. Lee and the entire staff are so caring and beyond excellent in their services. Dr. Lee was aware and so understanding of my fear and treated me with patience and kindness. And Dr. Lee's Assistant Luisana was wonderful and patient as well. I had quite a bit of work to be done over a period of time and after my first visit with them, I didn't fear going again! They even take the time to follow up with a phone call the next day to check on you. A welcoming smile and care from Elaine will greet you when you enter.  I highly recommend Dr. Lee and his Staff at South Bay Family Dental Practice to everyone!!<//text>

<Text>I am so blessed to have come across this office as I have not been to a dentist in over 20 years due to being anxious and bad experiences. I happened to need emergency care and walked in not knowing if I can be seen that same day. They squeezed me in as soon as Dr. Lee was finished with his patient. Wow! He was so patient and gentle with me. The entire experience was amazing. Dr. Lee and his staff (Elaine, Luisana, and Brian) are professional, courteous, friendly, and most importantly treats you like family and not just another patient. The staff is great and super meticulous with their work. I would recommend this office to anyone looking for top quality care in South Bay.<//Text><name>Lyn Vicente<//name></record>

First time patient - will be a lifelong one now. Amazing experience! Super professional and friendly office staff. I woke up with tooth pain and facial swelling in a panic. Luisana bent over backwards to get me in same day and early too! She was very kind and understanding on the phone. Elaine at the front desk was warm and friendly. I'm pretty sure we're best friends now. The facility is very clean and modern inside. Dr. Lee saw me quickly and I was in and out in less than an hour. Prices were beyond reasonable which is a blessing as I have no insurance being self employed. This place is amazing and I am actually looking forward to my follow up appointment next week. I would highly recommend this place. I had nothing but amazing customer service from start to finish today. Couldn't have asked for a better visit given the circumstances.<//Text>

My kids were going to a “pediatric dentist” before I brought them here. Dr lee and his staff knew just how to help an anxious and afraid child. My daughter hasn’t had the best experiences in the dentists office before this, even though I took her to dentists that advertised that their specialty is children! Elaine helped greet my daughter in a sweet, caring and personable manner. And Luisana then was very encouraging when it came to sitting in the chair and showing her the instruments and how they worked. My daughter walked in there “scared” from previous experiences, and by the time we left she was laughing and smiling and so happy that it was a good visit. They are the best! I would highly recommend this great dental clinic, and I will definitely be recommending them to my friends and family.<//text>< pictures>

Dr Lee's office is the best.  Luisana and Elaine are great.  So professional and courteous.  Also clean and neat. There has never been a time they couldnt see me on short notice when an emergency comes up.  I would recommend them to everyone.</Review>

<Review>A fabulous experience, which begins with Elaine’s friendly and personal phone call to remind us of the appointment. The entire staff is knowledgeable and efficient, but they are equally adept at making customers feel welcome and comfortable. I have always hated going to the dentist, but both Luisana and Dr. Lee have made me feel at ease about my visits. I love that I found this place!</Review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None</response>< gmapID>

This is an awesome location to be seen!! They work with all insurances. Dr. Lee is very personable and gentle. Luisana is so friendly and sweet. And Elaine is the top reason I go there. She remembers me and asks how I'm doing and gives great advice for upkeep on my teeth. Great job guys!!!</text>

Dr. Lee, Luisana and Elaine are so considerate and caring-they give the best care to this big baby! I was afraid to go to the dentist until I started coming here. Any work you need done is explained so you can understand and you are treated as if you are a friend. I am encouraged to take better  care of my teeth, and am now consistent in my oral health.< /review>

The staff are great! Especially Elaine and Luisana. I got called back from Elaine checking on me before they closed. They really care about their patients.

Dr Lee did a great job on checking my teeth the first time and consulted me what needed to get done.

Today he conducted a tooth extraction which went well.

I do recommend this place for any dental care.

I will be coming again!</text>

I came in this morning with a horrible toothache. Elaine was very friendly, professional and courteous.  Luisana put my nerves at ease and walk me step by step on what was to come from my emergency tooth extraction.  Dr. Lee was gentle and prompt during the process.  A great experience through a painful moment thanks to this awesome staff.</review>

I would recommend this dentist and assistants for any dental work you need. I am a big coward when getting my teeth worked on but today I know I will go back for dental problems of any kind. The dentist,
Assistants,  Elaine and Luisana were so helpful and caring . They pulled my tooth and did it without me feeling no pain at all. Thanks to all of you.<//review>

I recently needed some crown work done and was taken care of by Dr. Lee and Luisana in the office.

Highly recommend this office and staff when you are need of dental work.< /text>

<review>Very professional!  From the warm welcome from Elaine when you first walk in making you feel like family, to Luisana being very thorough by walking you step by step on the procedure that’s going to be done, to Dr. Lee’s concern about how you are feeling while he works on your teeth.  Very good communication from the front of the office staff to the back of the office staff. Great teamwork led by Dr. Lee.<//review></record>

<review>Have been coming here for years. Painless and relaxing. Luisana and Elaine are quick and thorough with everything they do.  Friendly and very sincere.  Everything is always taken care of and always seen on time.  Dentist has soft tough and never experienced any pain since being treated here.  Would not go anywhere else.< /review></record>

<Text>The time I waited at the lobby was pleasant and at ease with Luisa and Elaine, it transfixed my previous doings and unwinded them. I enjoyed the time I spent with Dr. Bruce Lee and his assistant Zahir because it felt comforting being open to my doctors. A friend of mine and myself, at the clinic, were very well attended, respected, and understood. If there’s a place where someone feels concerned about visiting the dentist because they think they’ll get hurt, I recommend coming here because these guys are experts. Speaking with a clear voice, from my experiences, I don't leave hurt from coming to this clinic, and I believe that anyone who visits will find themselves at a comfortable stay. I think that you’re check up is done rightfully.< /Text>< Name>

<Text>I have always been one to dislike going to the dentist, but if I had to ... this is where I am going. I can not say enough good things about this practice. A great expirence from start to finish. Elaine is awesome. She is very welcoming ! She makes you feel at home & even takes the time to make conversation as well as remembering past conversations she had with you. Luisana is great. She helps talk me through my anxiety with dentist visits. So many times she has calmed me down & gets me through every time. Dr. Lee is amazing. He explains every step as well as what to expect as he works. He makes me feel as comfortable as can be. I even took my almost 2 year old son for his first visit & Dr. Lee was very understanding and patient with him which I thought was amazing !!!  I highly recommend this group of amazing people to every and anyone looking for a pleasant visit.<//Text>< Pics>

My daughter was having problems with cold things touching her tooth. Over the weekend it only hurt more. We went to South Bay Family Dental Practice for an evaluation. They were all very professional and friendly and were quickly able to make the diagnosis and recommendation for eradication of the problem.
We are very pleased with South Bay Family Dental Practice and highly recommend their services to anyone in need of dental care.<//Review>

I came to this office for a consultation on a implant for to tooth.
Elaine at the front office was very nice and was quick to schedule me a consultation appt.
Luisana took me back and very very good at explaining to me what involved in a implant procedure.
Dr.Lee is a great dentist.
I would highly recommend this office for all your dental needs.Top notch staff and Dr.</Text>

<review>Dr. Lee is by far the absolute best dentist I've ever had! He does a fantastic job and his staff are the most sweetest people , Elaine and Cindy always make me feel really comfortable. They focus on one patient at a time which makes the process a lot faster and it makes me feel at ease. Such a professional and pleasant atmosphere I will continue to come and recommend this dentist.<//review><user_name>Selina Delvalle<//user_name></record></dataset><record>

<Date>1552947197540<//Date><Review>My husband and I have been patients of Bruce Lee, DDS, since he came to the south bay, after his Navy career. We were among his first patients and I, who hate needles, drills and PAIN, DO NOT mind going to Bruce Lee as his temperament is calm, cool and knowledge infused!!  We have referred several friends to this practice and will continue to do so.

The staff is super friendly and very professional. Their smiles are indicative of the service you are to receive. They know how to handle your insurances and always look out for your benefit. Everyone here really care about THEIR patients!!!  This place is a class act!!< /Review>< Pictures>

<review>This is a great place if you are looking for a fresh start on dental care or for any matter needed. The staff is great and friendly, Elaine and Luisana went the extra mile to make sure I got the care I needed and answered any questions, they provided great genuine service. The dental work is just as awesome. I got extractions done and the dentist made sure I was comfortable during the whole procedure and it really did helped ease the experience. I definetly recommend trying them out.</review>< Pics>

Dr. Bruce Lee has been our dentist for about three years now. He is very professional, and works well with my three-year-old son. Elaine and Luisana were there to help on our last visit, and they were friendly. We plan to return for our recommended six-month appointments.</text>

I couldn’t speak any higher of Dr Lee, Luisana and Elaine.  As someone who as a big baby about going to the dentist, fear no more.  Dr Lee is so gentle and kind.
The prices are very reasonable,  had to do extensive work and considered going to TJ, UGH.  No need affordable.  And with cleanings every three months as Dr lee recommended for me and my case, we have been able to put off some of the work for for 5 years now!!
I recommend them to anyone who mentions they’re looking for a dentist!</text>

He was great with my 2 year old’s first checkup and amazing with my cleaning and crown! He even did all the cleaning himself, which is rare for dentists! He didn’t bounce around between patients and really took the time to focus on just one person. His techniques were awesome and the numbing shot didn’t even hurt! The staff is super friendly and Elaine at the front desk is incredibly sweet! She always remembers me. Don’t let the outside of the building scare you (it’s a little bit of a rough area). The inside is very clean and modern, however. Absolutely recommend this office!!</text><GmapID>0x80d94c1125e21c83:0x3a06bf2297effd83<//GmapID><userid>113450732388235838480< /userid>< response>

Everytime I've come here I am always greeted with hospitality it is such a welcoming environment and I get the best treatments wether it be a tooth cleaning or a pulling. Luisana and Elaine know how to make someone feel welcomed as you come in for an appointment and offer you a seat and unlike other dental offices this one is very nice and treats their customers as family. 10/10 would reccomend to family and friends!<//text>

I've always had a great experience here at South Bay Family Dental, Dr. Lee is always great in taking care of any issue, and Elaine and Luisana are lovely, informed, and always willing to help.  It is a friendly and cozy environment that is always welcoming.</Text>

I have been going here for about 5 years now and the whole staff at South Bay Family dental is always a joy to be around. I've always had a great experience here even when some of the dental procedures are not the most pleasant thing to go through. The staff really makes this place!< /Review>

<rating>5</rating><pictures>None<//pictures><Review>It's been years since I've received dental care and was very scared. I started bringing my children here at first but I then noticed the relationship I developed with Luisana and Elanie. So I decided to become a patient and here I am 2 years later still coming. I have nothing but great experiences here with Dr Lee and his staff.  From the moment you walk in the front door to the phone call you receive later on before the day's end you feel the warmth and caring. I would highly recommend Dr Lee for any services to anyone from the young to the elderly.</Review><userid>105311906468495904749< /userid></record>

I love this dental office. The staff treats my son and I like family. Appointments are easy to arrange with Elaine at the front desk and Luisana is the best dental assistant especially when my son is in the chair. Dr Lee is cool, fast, efficient and gets the job done. Never had any issues with this place. I no longer live in the area but still continue to go here because of  how great this place is. And next door there's a riteaide so you can get ice cream afterwards😁</review>

Wow, what a staff! I usually don't like going to the dentist but once you walk in, Luisana and Elaine make you feel at home. The staff is incredible! I would recommend South Bay Family Dental Practice to anyone, especially friends and family. - Rogelio Brown.

Elaine and Luisana are amazing! They are so kind and helpful. The music in the office makes you feel at ease and Dentist Bruce Lee makes you feel comfortable. Great job guys! Definitely recommend. - Lala Brown< /text>

< review>
So I took my husband to get his wisdom teeth removed here about 3 weeks ago.  He said the dentist  Dr. Lee was great.  I was apprehensive about his review since I didn't experience it first hand. I truly hate going to the dentist.  I always feel the pain of any procedure even after getting novocain.  Let me begin with Elaine. She is a very sweet lady.  I called her today to get an emergency appt and she brought me in right away (within 15 min). They took xrays and Dr Lee came in and checked my teeth.  He said I needed to extract the tooth and have a bone graph done for a future implant.  I was super nervous and very scared. When I mean scared, I mean shaking literally.  They gave me a blanket that's how much I was shaking.  Then Luisana came and calmed me down. She walked me through the entire process and I was actually calm. She has a very soothing effect. Dr Lee made sure I didn't feel any pain.  This was the first time in a over 20 years that I didn't feel any pain during a dental procedure.  I love this dental office.  The ladies are all lovely and deserve much respect for what they do. Dr Lee is awesome and he will now be my dentist that I go to. There was another girl there,  but I don't recall her name.  She was great too. Kept me calm while the novocaine kicked in.  Thank you ladies and Dr Lee.< /review>

Dr Lee and his team are the best! You never wait too long in the office and Dr Lee is gentle and most importantly, painless. Clean office too, which is very important.< /Review>

<review>(Translated by Google) We visited the children for the first time and had a basic checkup with the clinic. Once my doctor was in Korea, I was able to communicate comfortably and I was very grateful for the patient. It is a long - term examination, but it was more thorough than the examination in Korea. The treatment was recommended for the necessity. The second treatment was well received. The staff are kind.

아이들과 처음 방문 해서 클리닉과 기본 검진을  하였습니다. 일단 의사쌤이 한국 분이시라 편안하게 의사소통할 수 있어 좋았고 진심으로 환자를 대해주시니 감사했습니다. 오랜만에 받는 검진인데 한국에서 진료 받을 때보다 더 꼼꼼하게 검진해 주셨어요. 치료는 꼭 필요한거 위주로 권하셨고. 두 번째 치료도 잘 받았습니다. 스텝분들도 친절하세요.</review>< pictures>

no change of place. Dr. Lee does an excellent job with the smile of my family, he is honest and tells you the options you have to repair your teeth, quite reasonable prices, gives you the best option according to your needs.

(Translated by Google) I had to find a dentist because I could not stand the pain of my tooth and I was not wrong to choose South Bay dentist. Since I entered the office I felt welcome. Elaine and Luisana were very kind and patient to help me with my insurance. From the first day I went I felt like family. From the moment you enter until you leave, you are aware of what the client needs. The doctor. Read very kind, patient and very profecional. And Brian very nice too and I explain everything with details of the procedure. As I was very satisfied with the work of everyone in the office, I made an appointment to all of my family members. Definitely from now on I will go with them.

Tenia que buscar un dentista porque ya no aguantaba el dolor de mi muela y no me equivoque al escoger south bay dentist. Desde que entre a la oficina me senti bienvenida. Elaine y Luisana fueron muy amables y pacientes para ayudarme con mi aseguranza. Desde el primer dia que fui me senti como en familia. Desde que entras hasta que te vas  estan al pendiente de lo que el cliente necesita. El dr. Lee muy amable, paciente y muy profecional. Y Brian muy amable tambien y me explico todo con detalles del procedimiento. Como quede muy satisfecha con el trabajo de todos en la oficina ya les hice cita a todos los de mi familia. Definitivamente desde ahora voy a ir con ellos.< /review>
