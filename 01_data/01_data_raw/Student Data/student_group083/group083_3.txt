<username>CaliPharmGirl<//username><Date>1592658513672</Date><rating>1< /rating><Review>Unfortunately my previous optometrist retired a couple of years ago. He took care of my eyes for nearly a decade. Going to Stanton was my 2nd attempt at finding a replacement. 😕
I needed a contact lens exam. Suffice it to say, I'm still looking for another optometrist next time need an exam. If you want personal, attentive service don't go here. The exam is done without the physical presence of an optometrist which I didn't realize until I was taken to the room for the exam. Patients should be made aware of this immediately upon check in. I feel as if this fact was purposely hidden. The wait time was horrendous. They were out of a sample for my prescription contact lens. Plus they tried to force me to buy 6 months of contact lens without trying the prescription sample first. I had to tell the guy, "No!" twice before he accepted my answer as final.
Not the service I'm used to. Ask questions about the exam upon arrival so you know what you're getting into. Pro side, the guy who checked me in and did my pretest for glaucoma was friendly which made this bitter pill a little easier to swallow.</Review>< Pics>

<Text>Appointment was fine it's been harder to pick up prescription glasses because they won't tell you correct information about their hours. We called at 5:20pm on a Wednesday and they assured us they closed at 6 and when we got there at 5:40pm they told us they were closed. It would be helpful if you would update you website to the correct hours.Today (Thursday) when i called again they told me Wednesday and Thursdays they close at 5 and all other days they close at 6.<//Text><date>1616093578019< /date>< response>

<Review>The staff here is phenomonal.  I was able to make an appointment same day.  They were personable and helped me find the perfect pair of glasses and contacts.  Nathan was informative and the receptionist as well.  I would highly recommend this place.  My insurance wasn't covered here but the deal was worth it.  Thanks again!<//Review>< gmapID>

< Review>
Pay attention to the bad reviews!!!! The workers don’t know how to do their job. They need retraining and maybe to go back to high school to learn basic skills again. You’ll have better luck at eyeglass world. Vista Stanton optical is trash and they like to waste ur time. And if the owner replies to this comment don’t just say a bunch of bs claiming to have high quality stuff. Resolve an actual issue for once jesus. Whoever owns this store shouldn’t own it. Get better management and workers or just close the store down.<//Review>

Whatever you do, don't go here! They make it sound like they have all kinds of deals but when you arrive,all the pricing changes. When I first got there I was told it would be $115 of my $150 insurance allowance for my exam alone, but when I pushed back and said my insurance card says $20, suddenly they magically found some "new" pricing that made it $20. You don't get to see a real doctor, there was just someone on a video screen. They didn't ask me any of the usual questions I get when seeing an in person doctor and the exam was very limited. The prescription contacts they gave me were awful and I could not read anything with them in. I had to wear readers over them at all times. I called the next day and told them that the contacts didn't work and to cancel my order but they STILL billed my insurance for the box of contacts that I never picked up and that I cancelled less than 24 hours after leaving the exam. So I am out over $70 worth of contacts that I never received and told them I could not use. When I called to cancel the order I was told no problem since I cancelled within 48 hours of the exam and then they billed my insurance anyway and THEY got paid for the contacts that I never received. Now my insurance allowance for the year is used up and I still have no contacts  This is a SCAM! They try to swindle all the money they can out of you. Go somewhere else!
UPDATE: I see the reply below and my response is that I have already called multiple times. I called customer service yesterday anjd asked to speak with a supervisor and after being put on hold AGAIN, I was told they were in a meeting but that the supervisor would call me back. I have NOT received a call back.They took all my info yesterday, so if you want to make it better, please call me.< /review>

My husband and I have been extremely unhappy with our experience with Stanton. My husband got glasses through them and the frame snapped after a month and a half. He didn’t drop them or anything. We went back to utilize the warranty and had to pay a fee to use the warranty. We did it. Then 2 months later, while sitting watching TV, the frame snaps again. I called to see what could be done. And they said they basically couldn’t do anything because the frame warranty was already used. They told us we could buy a new frame and that was it.

Needless to say we won’t be returning. And I definitely would advise against going to anyone else. Go to Lens Crafters instead. Prices are pretty much the same and they actually stand by their products!<//Text>

I usually go to this place I liked them. But my prescription expired today and I had a accident with my very last pair and was down to 1 contact. Which is extremely irritating to me.  So I call to place an order my prescription expires today I work all weekend I'll come next week. But they refused to place an order for me so I can not have to work with one good eye as soon as possible.  But they wouldn't. I felt this was unreasonable. I mean help out here I'll come thru on Monday. Still no so no theyey will no longer be getting any more of my money.<//text>

It is a total scam.
Do Not give them money
There are No refunds!!! Ever!!
No optometrist on site
All done via television
I went in for new contacts
Was told i would have them same day
Then at the end they didn’t have in stock
Said they would order
3 days max
Been 2 weeks. No contacts. No refund.
I guess i will try disputing the charge with my bank.
Whatever lame response they put on this review is fake.

<review>I probably will never use this company again. I'm in customer service so I'm always careful of how I handle customers when it comes to the price. This company is a prime example of "Bait and Switch". To advertise one price to lure people in and go from 500 dollars  and then  lowered it 3 times.  I wanted to leave because I felt like I was being ripped off. They really don't care about repeat business like I do. Hit the customer once and see you later< /review>< resp>

This pace is a RIP OFF. Horrible experience. Remote eye exam. Remote Ophthalmologist. 2 week wait time. Upgrades are ridiculous.  2 for the price of one CLEARLY does not exist.

...Beautiful, new, 3 month old store with a large selection of frames for every budget.  Their location was very easy to find, and had very ample parking.
The whole crew from virtual opthalmologist, to the 2 store managers, and all technicians, were  so nice, and  patient. I noticed each one,,,, go the extra* step to make sure, each of their customers were satisfied with their new glasses, before they left the store.
This location will definitely  get  more organized as time goes by. Our family will be happy to recommend your store to our friends and neighbors.<//Review>

<review>I don’t really do negative reviews but in this case........
I went in for an eye exam to see if my prescription had changed, my distance vision is blurry but I have no problem reading fine print. My exam was conducted via tele conference with the doctor. Not what I’m used to but OK. After the exam I was told to pick out frames while we waited for the results. Knowing my insurance covers frames up to $100 I said sure. The associate then went over the results of my exam where I was shocked to learn the Doctor recommended progressive lenses to help me with my reading. Hmmmm, I then picked up the card they had on the counter to determine if you need glasses and read every line easily. The associate then went over what the glasses would cost me out of pocket after insurance. Needless to say I had already lost all confidence in the honesty of this establishment. When I told the associate I would not be making a decision right then they snapped “I thought you were here to buy glasses today “ I said “no I came in for an eye exam.” The associate said they were going to get the manager to “close this sale.” I told them they were wasting their time and left. I felt like they were using pretty shady techniques to increase sales. I also saw 3 separate customers come in having problems with glasses they had purchased there. To their credit the problems were met with a “let’s get this fixed “ attitude but not exactly confidence inspiring. Take it for what it’s worth, I’m staying away from Stanton!< /review>< pics>

Checked out the 59.00 special. Typical bait and switch. For me all I needed are reading glasses. But I need 325 magnification. That is extra. Unless I like frames that are really ugly, they go from 29.00 to well over 200.00.
The people seemed great, very professional. But I don't see anyone getting out of there for anything close to 59.00.</text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Review>A disheartening experience using virtual optometry. No one tells you you see an eye Dr. via call center. No real person to check your eyes. No questions about what you do or even a simple hand shake. Staff is friendly enough but they should mention you don’t Actually see a Dr. ( in real life). Computer age fine. But this is ridiculous!!!

I brought my 7 and 8 year old here for exams. The eye doctor was amazing and patient with both. Only one child needed glasses. The other had something slight and if he was dishonest could have recommended we pay the extra for glasses but didn't. Overall everyone was very kind and helpful. They took the time to explain all the deals to me with good attitude, I can ask a lot of questions :)</review>

<Review>Terrible customer service. Called for a quote on eye exam and polycarbonate lenses.Spoke to three different employees and was put on hold for 15 min. Each time I asked for a price on an exam exam for single vision I was asked what time I would like to schedule my appointment for. Pressuring me to make an appointment when I don’t even have the information I need as a cash patient.
I have my own frame, specifically stated I DO NOT WANT TO BUY FRAMES JUST LENSES AND EYE EXAM and again with “if you buy two pairs of glasses...” that’s not what I asked. Each person I spoke with gave me a different price. I worked in the optical business for many years and never have I heard of employees having lack of knowledge when it comes to their services. Glad I called before I walked in there! Will not be using their services.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Well, I had a bad experience getting the sales person understand that I need them for short and last distance at the end I received them only for long vision so I couldn't read a book so I went back and I talked to Jon Solda a new. Manager and I was pleased with his professionalism and apologies; he solved all the issues immediately...go to Stanton Oceanside you get a good deal if not near your expertises......<//Review>

Went here back in September because I needed glasses same day....
First off complete bait and switch, the initial quote they gave me was about $520 or so, way more than what I expected given their promotion. This was with $20 frames, imagine if I would've picked something a little nicer.

Was told to come back at the end of the day, went back, not ready, after them giving me the run-around I was told they would have to ship them to me, so much for the same day BS

Well today I called asking to have my prescription emailed to me, which I paid for, now I'm being told I have to drive 2 hours there to show them my ID so they can email me my prescription.

Do not go here, complete waste of time, money, terrible customer service, bait and switch.

Uncomfortably pushy sales tactics, terrible all the way around< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>{'time': 1561067026421, 'text': 'Thank you for sharing your feedback, we really appreciate it and we will definitely send it to our management team.'}</Response>< GmapID>

That wasn't a problem for me. After all, we all have first days on the job, right? However, when I finally received my glasses, (3 weeks late due to Hurricane Maria), they screwed up one of the pairs of glasses.

Store selection is pretty broad, and employees are courteous, but don't seem to care about service. Selling was all. Optometrist had appointment over skype(?) and I could hardly understand him. Assistant left the room and did not help me with the removal of the headgear. Took us thirty minutes to get the transcript. Mind you, the store was empty.<//Review>

This place is a rip off. The whole 2 for $59.99 is a lie. I just took my wife here and after her exam the guy said she owed $89.00 for the exam and had to pay $300.00 more for her glasses. $100.00 per frame. This place false has false advertising. Don't go here.< /text>

<text>Today was my first time here and it was the BEST eye glasses place I have ever been to. The employees that work here are all friendly, helpful and kind. I was having a pretty upsetting day and they all were able to put a huge smile on my face and work around with what I wanted. They have amazing deals that I have not seen anywhere else. Also ontop of all of this ... they also have a very wide and HUGE selection of glasses to chose from. Everything is priced reasonably at a perfect price. I do not think it is possible for someone to not find at least one pair of glasses here that they will absoultly LOVE! I thank all of you who helped me today to have the best experiece and you all made my day. Thank you all again and I look forward to coming back (: I am very pleased with the experience I had here today.< /text>< pictures>

I'm sorry that wasn't your experience."}<//Resp><Text>I do not want to give ANY stars but I have to give at least one to post this review. NOT GIVING ANY STARS ON THIS REVIEW.  First, I made a 1:30 appointment and the I was told the doctor had just left wen I got there at 1:15.  Eye exam was via Skype with a "virtual" doctor.  I asked to have a "real" doctor review my test and check my eyes.  I asked about eye HEALTH testing such as cataracts or glaucoma.  The  doctor said they had the equipment but that it was not set up yet. When I questioned him, he then said it wasn't functioning properly.  He suggested I be sure to go to a doctor to get my eye health check up because that is VITAL!  DUH, I said that's why I am here.  I asked if he was an optometrist but got no answer.  He is there solely to sign the prescription from the "virtual" doctor. So I had to wait an additional 30 minutes for him to return from lunch and sign my prescription.  Then when I went to order glasses, I had to wait for Claudia, even though two other reps were available to help me but they could not ring me up.  I left and came back to the same foolishness, so needless to say, I took my prescription and went to another optical shop to order my glasses. It was a waste of time and money for the exam.  I went in on Tuesday as a walkin and they had 2 people waiting.  I went in on Wednesday with a 1:30 appt. and had to wait around for the doctor to SIGN my prescription.  But left after over an hour waiting to order my glasses.  I forfeited my $45 exam fee because they were NOT able to help me on 3 separate days.  RIDICULOUSNESS!  I feel I was cheated out of my $45.  How can you apply the exam fee to the glasses if it takes 3 days to get them ordered.  NEVER going back, they don't have their act together yet.  The clerk said they had been open 2 months.  WAY TOO LONG FOR THIS MUCH POOR SERVICE< /Text>< pictures>

<text>There are only two people at Stanton Optical who knows what they are doing or/and what's going on. Anyone needs to be fired cause they sound like zombies or they don't know what's going on. If you go.. ONLY deal with Claudia or the main manager from Santee. I think her name is Michelle.

Beyond these two don't or you'll regret it. I had three experiences with this Oceanside shop. The first two experiences were amazing but the last one.. I wanted to scream and write a nasty review but I can't 100% cause 2/3 of the time was great.

First time I went in Claudia was there to welcome me with a great smile, she help out get my frames replaced (get the insurance its SO WORTH IT), they took my lenses with my broken frames, they said they will pop out the old ones and; put the old lenses in the new frames and than she sold me on some new awesome Swiss sunglass (that I LOVE), second time I picked my new sunglasses which were perfect (again Claudia and Michelle both were awesome again) ..but than the third visit had to happen (UGH). I was told my glasses were ready and I could pick them up. Well I get there.. They say only my frames were there and they needed the lenses. The very same lenes they took on the first visit. The girl there fights me on it at first. Than the scramble for my lenses begin. I am waiting and waiting patiently but In the end Michelle has them cut new ones. Claudia had the day off.

I am telling NOW! Only deal with Claudia or Michelle. One huge thing thou I'm sure a lot of people hate.. is the phone number. I don't why we need a out of state number. Its a minor thing but I find it odd. You're better off booking your appointment online.<//text>< Pics>

<review>Drove a total of 45 minutes to get to location specifically for this special only to hear that we must spend an additional 150$ along with the 30$ I spent on the groupon in order to use the groupon. So, the deal really is buy one pair, get the second for 30$. Super ridiculous. Such a waste of time, money, gas, and mostly, patience. If only I could give negative stars. Smh at this false advertising. Makes me not want to use groupon anymore.< /review>< user_id>

I made an appointment for an exam over the phone but when I arrived they said they were only allowing exams for glasses not contacts. I thought this was very bizarre since an optometrist has always done both for me without an issue in the past. After finding out that 'the optometrist' is not actually in the office and does exams via skype from a cubicle with phones ringing in the background and you can hardly understand him I chose to go elsewhere.< /Text>

<text>I went to the Modesto Dental office to see about getting my partial fixed nothing else.  Then they can up with capping teeth not telling me the cost & why.  After months and $2,000 I still do not have a partial.  The partial they remade two times does not fit.  Do Not Go There.  I guess I will either go without or find another dentist.</text></record>

I expected a better experience for my wisdom teeth removal . The negatives were the dentist after he was done didn’t explain anything that happened, I didn’t even know if I needed sutures are not because they didn’t tell me and so I was worried and wondered why I didn’t need them when I’ve heard it’s common to get sutures i also I had to ask for the print out of how to care for my extraction sites . It just seemed like they were in a rush and the front desk ladies were not friendly at all.< /text>

<Text>My daughter had braces on.. after going to other ortho dr i liked this one the best.. he didn’t remove any teeth and although my daughter has an underbite he suggested not having surgery for that, so that was a blessing, i was terrified to even think of her having that procedure.. 2 years later she has a beautiful smile, her treatment was very mild pain.. the assistant s were very gentle and sweet..
Front office staff were not my favorite but they accommodated her appts to where we were able to take her in on my schedule..
overall we had a good experience thank you Bright dental 🦷<//Text>< Pictures>

<Review>I made my appointment for 2 weeks. When I arrive the dentist takes all of 3 min to visually look at my teeth and tell me the amount of time I would need braces. He doesn’t do X-rays so that was odd to me. Then the coordinator comes after him to tell me how much it would cost. Of course she does not have the information ready because my insurance office is closed. It was a Saturday! Of course it’s closed. I’m writing this at 4:30 pm Monday following my appointment and I have yet to hear back. I was told Monday I would be contacted with a quote. Worst part was the sink are where I was told to rinse my mouth out was dirty. We’re in a pandemic, that office should have been spotless. I would not recommend going.</Review><pics>None< /pics><user_id>106282803960803431381< /user_id>< time>

Not a long wait I was very comfortable everybody was so nice. I love the staff and the actual doctor she is highly educated and explained so much in so little wording and I feel very safe going back for my further appointments. If you have wisdome teeth come here. I'm never going anywhere else ever again. They are so kind.<//text>

I had my first appointment here a few weeks ago. The staff and the dental hygienist were very nice, but they were running late and I had to wait about 45 minutes after my scheduled appointment time. The doctor was not friendly; she took a look at my teeth and without explanation she told me I needed my wisdom teeth pulled and braces. She did not explain why she was recommending this and was rude when I asked her questions about it. I’m 30 years old, have already had braces and three different dentists in ten years have never told me my wisdom teeth were an issue.

I just called to reschedule an appointment I have  on Monday morning which is 68 hours from now. They told me they would have to charge a $75 dollar rescheduling fee because Sundays don’t count towards their 48 hour cancellation policy. I was already was suspicious that they were trying to get me to do unnecessary procedures because my insurance would cover it, now I’m pretty convinced this place is just out for your money.</Review>

Cons: Wait times, Rushed, poor receptionist customer service
***Dentist overlooked Notes; almost did the same procedure

Pro: I saved nearly doubled in prices for Deep cleaning and Braces, I was amazed just by choosing this quiet, nice dental office versus Western D. I enjoyed the pleasant receptionist as well as the dental assistant. Always polite. If you’re trying to save more with receiving the best best Results his is the place.

******Con: My first visit the wait was long but I felt that since this is the only one in the county.. I had a deep cleaning in my right. After, they rushed me out, like okay your done byeee. Well I had to ask to stop and rinse my mouth because I literally looked like a bloody mess. The second, WATCH THE DENTIST. He seems really nice but rushing. I went back a week later for the LEFT side portion of deep cleaning. He started numbing the RIGHT. I had to tell him that “you know you’re doing the right side?” He stopped looked at said I was right. He overlooked the notes.
Imagine if I didn’t say anything, the time and money wasted. Just be aware of what needs to be done.<//Text>< time>

The thing about Bright Now is that once they get you in there they won’t try to work with you when it comes to rescheduling. I talked to Sabrina this morning and I was running 10 min late and she said to not come anymore. Now I have to wait a month to be seen and I’m paying an extra charge for it. I’m very very disappointed. You don’t do that to your customers specially when it’s only 10 min late.< /Text>

Bright Now on Sisk has always been a pleasant experience.  Everyone listens to your needs, from the front office staff to the dentist's, which can be uncommon.  We've all felt like some doctor isn't really hearing us or understanding our needs, but not at Bright Now.  They're always there to listen and support their patients.< /Text>

I had just changed insurance companies and needed a new dentist for my routine check up. I had never been to Bright Now Dental, but they took my new insurance so I decided to give them a try....I just want to say I'm glad I did! I'm terrified of dentists but the staff were so professional and put my fears at ease by explaining everything to me and my options for pain medication if I still felt uncomfortable... thank you Bright Now for not making me feel insecure about my fears.<//review>

Scheduled an appointment for 2:30, I was there on time. After watching people go ahead of me who had appointments after me, I waited almost 90 minutes.  I asked for a refund of the service fee because I couldn't wait any longer. While getting my refund they then call me back. I don't know what happened, but someone made a mistake. Staff is real friendly. I have to find another dentist who respects my time.< /text>

Waiting time in reception was around 45min. Was transferred from Hayward to Modesto and they tell me my paperwork hasnt been transferred and my contract would be changed. Braces were suppose to be off in 3 months they dediced to give me an additional 9 to 12 months so my payments would be higher. They dont explain anything and you dont feel welcome. They basically told me to stay with my old office.< /Review>

This is my second visit for cleaning at this location. My appointment was at 10:30, I arrived at 10:15 signed in and sat down to wait. At no time was I told that they were running behind.  At 11am i went to the desk to ask how much longer (I had somewhere I needs to be at 11:45). That was when I was told they were running behind, more than 40minutes after my arrival. I had to reschedule for another day and I have a very busy schedule that I already had to rework to make my appointment.< /review>

When clarin comes back I will come back but as of now .. no. I'm not happy with anything and I was a loyal patient.  But the customer service I got today was terrible.  Rushed me to sign a 500 dollar fee that was to be collected and I didn't understand whT I was being charged like the collection lady couldn't even tell me why and what I was being charged for and on top of that my root canal still is sore after 3 weeks with 2 days of being worked on.  I'm good</Text>

You just are not able to do anything about my dental work because of my insurance doesn't cover your charges for my teeth and that's why I don't like how you do business with me I can't afford to pay for the dental work I am A low income person who needs to live on what I get each month.<//Text>

Terrible customer service and management.  The owner has some maturing to do.  "Everything is everyone else's fault" is the Mission Statement of this company.  STUDENTS BE CAREFUL!  This is the type of management company that will sue you when you leave and take what they can from you.
Outside vendors be careful!!  Owner thinks VERY highly of herself!  You could find yourself in a compromised position.

YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!<//Review>

Very disappointed in their lack of respect. Management is unorganized, unprofessional, respond when its convenient to them. Take too long in repairs, deny receiving repairs requests, delete the request, and are not properly and ethically responsive with loyal tenants.< /Text>

<Review>After overcharging my account, they advised their system does not allow refunds. This is the worst property management company, I have ever dealt with. They are rude, do not respond in a timely manner to maintenance request. They use their proximity to Chico State to lure poor students in then are abusive and will keep your security deposit, be prepared to go to small claims court!< /Review>< Response>

Kathy is possibly the most unprofessional human I have ever had to deal with. They took over our housing from IPM and right from the get go where rude and uncooperative. They had the ledger wrong and where trying to charge us an extra $500 that we did not owe. It took the owner of the property stepping in and saying to knock it off for them to get it taken care of.  Me and one other roommate where moving out and they took it upon themselves to say that we three out mattresses outside of the dumpster and it has to be us because we're the only ones who's reported moving and we will be charged accordingly. After sending them the proof Kathy asked for she threw a tantrum fit for a 15 year old and blocked me from the portal laving me no way to pay rent. She acted like some 15 year old who was entitled and if you called her out on her attitude she would throw a fit.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

I had a great experience with Chico Sierra.  Very professional and responsive.  They looked out for my best interests and treated me well, whether it was a maintenance call or on move out.  I honestly don't get the negative reviews.   I got treated well and got a fair refund of my deposit.  Nothing but a good experience.</review>

Unprofessional with poor service. Swimming combination. The agent told me to lie on on my cosigner application. I would avoid doing business with these guys if you have an alternative.</text>

After a week and half later they made up contradicting illogical reasons for why I can not rent the house. No definitive reason why I am denied when I was first in line for the house. They make things up on the fly to get through the conversation a d get you off the phone. In the end I am happy I am not going to do business with this company.

If I could give zero stars, I would.

When we moved in, we were told that the place had been cleaned. But we found a can of soda with a ziploc bag of HUMAN FECES on the floor in the bathroom. It would appear that the previous tenants were angry too.

1. I told them when I signed the lease that my dogs ESA license was in the mail, but it was taking forever to get here because of COVID. They said that was fine, and the pet deposit could get refunded when it was here. Then when it was here, they pretended like that conversation never happened.

2. A couple months into our lease, we were informed that they were building another house in the backyard and that there would be construction workers coming and going. The backyard which was a big selling feature for us (for the dog.) Nothing of this was mentioned before we signed our lease. They were silent when we went on and on about how excited we were about that yard.

3. Only 4 months into our 12 month lease, we are now being told that if we do not renew our lease right now, they will be processing new tenants.

4. We asked them to not bring in potential tenants into our home due to Covid concerns (and our lease isn't up for 8 months). They basically said they were going to do it anyway. So we have 3 people entering our home against our will today.

If all of this is even legal, it is at a minimum unreasonable and heartless. Do not rent from them. And double check other businesses; they appear to be changing their name... I would too if I had an AVERAGE of one star on Yelp.<//review>

Went several days without basic living necessities and then was lied to from chico Sierra on when they would be fixed. Only respond to maintenance requests and problems with the house when assisted from legal services. Name calling and threats are a common interaction between company and tenants. Several occasions where the house was broken or damaged and it was blamed on us. I could go on all day about this company and in the wise words of chico Sierra, “I have the pictures and documents”. Stay away from this company if possible and don’t get discouraged to get legal services involved to fix any problems. Hi Kathy :)<//Text>

The worst housing management I have ever encountered. The staff disregard your concerns and are unprofessional. When I had questions regarding my deposit I was pointed to the head of the management Cathy who could only be emailed, and her responses were no help, but rather rude. They made assumptions that my roommates and I threw couches and a mattress in the dumpster and were charged. Mind you, we had absolutely no furniture. I could go on, please do yourself a favor and do not lease with this management.< /review>

2 of my daughters rent from Chico Sierra and I have been really happy.  Both have rented from other Companies in town with much less success.  Renting again this year, and expect to have another  good year.  I have read some other reviews that they do not fix anything, but that is just the opposite of what we have experienced.  Maintenance shows up fast and always takes care of the issues that they have.  Front staff is nice and always helpful!  Like them a lot!!!<//Text>

Very unpleasant and unprofessional. I lived with them for 2 years in an old house with lots of problems from about 5 years of tenants living in it with just lease takeovers. charged us excessive amounts of money to fix problems in the house that are just basic maintenance things. They were also not concerned with our privacy, and showed our house over 10 times when we did not re-sign the lease. They also come through and just look at the house occasionally for no apparent reason. The front desk people are rude and seem incompetent at their jobs. They seem to do whatever they can to inconvenience their renters. The landscaping crew often didn't show up and we would have to harass them to get our lawn mowed. Other maintenance tasks were just as difficult to get done. They are in this business to make as much money as possible, not to make sure their renters are happy. I would never rent from them again and I recommend everyone avoid renting with them if possible.< /review>

<review>Horrible outfit. Property was falling apart, repair companies would come into house without authorization or notice, CSPEM stole damage deposit for issues what were clearly preexisting after failing to come for the inspection on move out day because they had "overbooked".

Even sent me a letter requesting an additional $250 for damages, threatening legal action. Turns out they can't do math either - the $250 was because they added incorrectly.

Unprofessional and unethical people to do business with. Stay away if you've got any sense.<//review><username>Dylan Stompe<//username></record>

Terrible management! Over charges for move out and adds charges for things that were damaged before you move in. Even if you provide proof of damages that were there before you moved in they will not take it into consideration. Do not trust! Do not move in! Only if there was a rating of 0 stars. They deserve that.<//review>

<Text>Property owners: do not use these folks! Read these reviews! Your tenants will be talked down to, disrespected, and asked to simply pull out of their lease so that CSREM won't have to deal with the complaints (no hot water? a broken appliance? : CSREM "I'll be happy to let you out of your lease"). Who has time for that?! My daughter rents from them. She is a single tenant. Twice recently they showed her apartment to potential future tenants and she came home to her toilet unflushed and the toilet seat up. Disgusting. She asked if they can monitor their tours a little better, but only got the usual snarky response in turn (i.e. "move if you don't like us to use and leave your bathroom filthy while you’re not home").</Text>< Pictures>

Just moved out, did not get all of my deposit back, but felt they were very fair based on previous people I had rented from.  Been with these guys for 2 years and they took out about $217.00 out of $900.
Certainly did not leave the Apt. spotless.
Anyway I like using them, would use them again.  Currently rented with Sheraton due to needing a bigger place, so we will see how that goes.<//text>

Great People!! Not only did they help me find a home, but they helped me rent my home as well.  They have been great to work with and I would tell anyone to use them.  Seems like they get really busy during the Summer months, and things take a little longer, but They have always taken car of all my needs, and as far as my rental home, they are on the ball.  I hated doing it myself and they have been great.  I give them two thumbs up.  Thanks guys<//Review>

They didn't tell us that one of our checks didn't go through, so we ended up with more than $300 of late fees. They said that we were notified multiple times, yet we didn't get any notices. We were told that the late fees were waived, and then told by the head person that they weren't. This company scams money out of people. I wish I read the reviews before I signed a lease with them.

<Rating>1<//Rating><text>Horrible experience. Repairs were rarely truely fixed. They did alot of repairs by patching things with temporary repairs than full replacements. Day 1 we found mold. Was damage. Cockroaches and oder and none of it was fixed by them. We took care of the mold and bombed multiple times for roaches but they would just move to other units through the wall's and heater system and then return later. Discovered the unit hadn't had carpets replaced or walls painted in 5 years (lease takeovers). You could see the filth along the top of the walls where the cleaning ladies missed when they came through to clean after the previous tenant moved out. Steam cleaned the carpet 4 times the day we moved in and was getting nasty brown water. Only had to steam it twice when we left because there was less dirt built up in the carpet. Not a good company to rent through if you have kids. We had a neighbor making false reports because our kids would play during the day when that tenant was trying to sleep. Had stray cats peeing on our door and they refused to do anything about it. Let themselves in to other people's units when they were gone. Peeked between curtains to see inside. Using inspections more often than what the law allows to harass tenants over false claims. Refused lease renewal because of retaliating against a negative review. Tried to evict us. Used email blocking to harass us regarding our negative review making threats to slander us to blacklist us from other rental units. We left the apartment cleaner than when we moved in and because the eviction fell through they called cps and tried to have our family torn apart over everything they refused to address in work orders. Their units were all poorly maintained and had mold water damage. Roaches etc. Kept our entire deposit. They no longer own the unit we rented from. They were extremely rude to anyone who confronted them on issues or their behaviors. It was so bad we stopped leaving home together because we didn't trust them not to just walk in and start snooping like we saw them do with other units. They tried to violate our lease over us talking to our neighbors .</text>< pics>

< Review>
Been living in one of their apartments since Dec. 2017 and so far not the best.  I've put in 2 requests to have the microwave fixed, each time someone came to "fix it" it just ended up not working again, haven't heard  back about them coming to replace it like I asked. Also haven't heard back about the stove that's ancient and 2 out of 4 burns do not work. Best of all they have not done anything about the roaches I've complained about from the beginning.  Lastly, what really makes my blood boil is how unprofessional and rude Cathy is! She is a total nightmare to deal with.</Review>

<Review>***AVOID THIS COMPANY!! *** This is the most unprofessional establishment I have ever dealt with. When my room mates and I moved into the unit it was FILTHY. Spider webs everywhere, floor was disgusting, carpets had thumbtacks in them, did not look like they attempted to clean the unit before we moved in. NOT TO MENTION ROACHES AND MOLD IN THE UNIT. We dealt with flooding throughout the year and constant problems with the unit. I couldn't close the window in my room for two months because there was mold in my room caused by the flood and the smell was too bad. However, they still held us responsible for problems caused by the flooding at the end of the year even though I put a request in to get the situation taken care of. After the flood they took my room mates carpet out and failed to replace it for months until we moved out, it was still carpetless. They are great at responding to maintenance requests, however, you still will not get your security deposit back. After dealing with constant flooding and problems with the unit (which we filed maintenance requests for) we still did not get our security deposit returned. Overall just a very UNORGANIZED and UNPROFESSIONAL management company.< /Review>< Time>

<Review>The office personal are completely rude and unprofessional. They seem to talk down to college students simply because they're college students.They lie to you in order to get you to submit more applications for the application fees knowing we would not be able to reside in the location applying for. Also told us they would give us an apartment that someone else planned to sign a lease for already????  LIARS! RUDE! UNPROFESSIONAL- find a different company!<//Review>< pics>

< review>
Went in to pay my rent today, and had some crazy person in the lobby ranting and raving about something stupid.  Made everyone that came in, want to leave.  The staff behind the counter dealt with it, but almost had to call the Police.  I do not normally write reviews, but this made me give them a thumbs up.  You could not pay me enough to do this job.  Seems like everyone hates their Mgmt Co.  I would have given them 5 stars, but sometimes the maintenance people can be a little slow.  Other than that, after 2 years I am still happy with them.  Would and have recommended them to friend.< /review>

<Text>If I could give this company a zero, I would. They were by far the worst place I have ever rented from. While living in their property, we experienced mice, cockroaches, holes in the wall leading to the outside property, and many other problems. I cannot express enough how difficult it was to work with them and how cheaply they tired to fix the problems. After finally moving out and waiting on our security deposit to come back, we had over 40% taken out, more than $400, in petty fees. We had left the house in better condition than received. Please SAVE YOURSELF from renting from this horrible company. Don't only take my review into account, go ahead and read everyone else's as well.<//Text><name>Ashley Manley< /name>< date>

As a senior (and no longer a student) I was shocked at how unprofessional the communication is at this business.  It would be easy to assume students are deadbeats but I cleaned for days and was told the house was dirty after 3 years of tenancy (it wasn't, just an old house with lots of problems).  Incredibly, we had to jump through hoops to get a walk through and then it ended when we attempted to film the process.  Now we received an email (and they are always angry--even from the beginning--insulting and rude just like other reviewers mention--not sure why even) saying my son's 4-inch service dog (7lbs.) gouged all the doors and they may need to be replaced.  As a former property owner I am shocked that long term tenants could be treated in such a way.  I hope other property owners as well as prospective students realize that this is no way to treat students in our community; we have always received our deposits back but this time I think we may not only denied--but asked to pay even more--it certainly appears to be their MO--read other reviews and don't let it happen to you!</text>

AVOID this company if you can. They take as much of your deposit as possible and it is detrimental to the bank account of a struggling college student. On top of that, it takes them forever to fix a problem in an apartment or house, and the companies they hire to fix and clean do NOT do a good job. I am more thankful than ever to be free from this company, AVOID AT ALL COSTS.<//review>

<Text>I got an apartment throught them in August and moved back out in Septemeber due to personal issues and I had to go through the process of getting someone to take over my lease. I called and asked what needed to be done and they told me so I advertised it everywhere and the man there told me they would do the same. THEY DIDN'T!! I had so many people interested and they all applied and I had called back to check up and they said no one had applied which was a lie because a lot of people applied. A while went by and I was getting so frustrated so I called and emailed them and when I called I asked about it and Megan the one there told me they had better things to be doing and was really rude. I would ask and look around first because they are NOT helpful at all. DON'T CHOOSE CHICO SIERRA!</Text><Response>None</Response></record>

The absolutely most unprofessional rental agency I have EVER dealt with. I am not a student, which really should make no difference, but I am a professional adult with a great rental history. They literally yelled at me in front of customers when i asked questions about my rental and lease. They called and threatened lawsuits when they misplaced rental checks, I could go on and on. Do NOT rent from them.<//Text>

<review>These people think they have right to keep entering they Want to do 3rd inspection in less then 6 months fishing for reasons to charge more and or evict us. So Do not do business with these people. They contacted my co signer when we pay our rent on time because we told them that the next inspection would be considered harassment and now are insisting on doing a 3rd in less then 6 months of living in the unit

I will consider editing this in a more positive manor if and when they stop harassing me and send a written apology.

If you like illegal activities form your apartment management company these guys are for you.

They are rude and unprofessional. They were nice until you stand your ground when your within your legal rights. I'm still renting form them but are being threatening so who knows how long which is also illegal. I have a right to speak the truth when being wronged and to give warning to others.

Know your rights and report any wrong doings with this company and they will learn a hard lesson. For anyone else that needs LIC ID 01526383

Original post as follows
________

These guys dont follow civil code 1954

1954. (a) A landlord may enter the dwelling unit only in the
following cases:
(1) In case of emergency.
(2) To make necessary or agreed repairs, decorations, alterations
or improvements, supply necessary or agreed services, or exhibit the
dwelling unit to prospective or actual purchasers, mortgagees,
tenants, workers, or contractors or to make an inspection pursuant to
subdivision (f) of Section 1950.5.
(3) When the tenant has abandoned or surrendered the premises.
(4) Pursuant to court order.
(b) Except in cases of emergency or when the tenant has abandoned
or surrendered the premises, entry may not be made during other than
normal business hours unless the tenant consents to an entry during
other than normal business hours at the time of entry.
(c) The landlord may not abuse the right of access or use it to
harass the tenant.
(d) (1) Except as provided in subdivision (e), or as provided in
paragraph (2) or (3), the landlord shall give the tenant reasonable
notice in writing of his or her intent to enter and enter only during
normal business hours. The notice shall include the date,
approximate time, and purpose of the entry. The notice may be
personally delivered to the tenant, left with someone of a suitable
age and discretion at the premises, or, left on, near, or under the
usual entry door of the premises in a manner in which a reasonable
person would discover the notice. Twenty-four hours shall be presumed
to be reasonable notice in absence of evidence to the contrary. The
notice may be mailed to the tenant. Mailing of the notice at least
six days prior to an intended entry is presumed reasonable notice in
the absence of evidence to the contrary.
(2) If the purpose of the entry is to exhibit the dwelling unit to
prospective or actual purchasers, the notice may be given orally, in
person or by telephone, if the landlord or his or her agent has
notified the tenant in writing within 120 days of the oral notice
that the property is for sale and that the landlord or agent may
contact the tenant orally for the purpose described above.
Twenty-four hours is presumed reasonable notice in the absence of
evidence to the contrary. The notice shall include the date,
approximate time, and purpose of the entry. At the time of entry, the
landlord or agent shall leave written evidence of the entry inside
the unit.
(3) The tenant and the landlord may agree orally to an entry to
make agreed repairs or supply agreed services. The agreement shall
include the date and approximate time of the entry, which shall be
within one week of the agreement. In this case, the landlord is not
required to provide the tenant a written notice.
(e) No notice of entry is required under this section:
(1) To respond to an emergency.
(2) If the tenant is present and consents to the entry at the time
of entry.
(3) After the tenant has abandoned or surrendered the unit.<//review><GmapID>0x808327ac6558c5ad:0x43e58a08e2365cd6<//GmapID><resp>None</resp>< Rate>

Rude management staff. There were cockroaches that had infested every single apartment and when they bombed one place all of the roaches migrated to another apartment. Told management the only way to get rid of them would be to bomb all places at once and they never got back to us. Bed bugs infested every single apartment by the end of the year. Tried to charge us for the pest problem and over charged for everything else. Terrible terrible management company and terrible horrid properties that are so old and run down that you have different problems all the time. NEVER... i repeat NEVER.... rent from this company.< /review>

Had a fun time here.  Very professionally done tour with a good mixture of history of the building,  the story of the business,  and the production facilities.  One hour fifteen minutes for the tour was just about right,  and they gave warning to use the bathroom facilities before we began.  Pleasantly surprised they not only allow but encourage photography and interacting with some of the sets.  If this is your thing it's worth the trip.< /Text>

Great location for a concert.   Two entrances and fast moving lines.   They facility is clean, large and updated.   The bathrooms are clean and located throughout the building.  I have been to a few raves and always enjoyed the place.   I recommend using the VIP entrance and coat check.   It is easy to get an Uber or Lift so DON'T drive.</Text>

This is freaking cool. Do the tour. The building history is fun but what they now do with it is awesome and fun to check out. Our tour guide was awesome too. She was fun, cracked jokes and was informative.</Text>

Sexy times... that's all I'm gonna say. 😎 kink you will be missed. They are still gonna be around, just not here. It's a complicated story. Basically they are losing money due to production costs. & the city of San Fran wants a change here too. It's no hard feelings or anything like that. I was here during the Folsom fair back in 2015. I met a lot of empowered independent thinking people of all kinds. I met so many amazing people, that was all before I got my first smart phone. If I had one back then, I would've taken a million pictures of all the places I went to, including of course kink. I can't say what I saw or what happened. All I can say is there are many amazing independent sexually empowered people who live in the bay area. That's all I can say about that. Cali is a great state, & the bay area is good too. Kink I say to thee...you will be missed. Peace & love for ever to you all. Oh and one last thing. The armory has amazing look & history to it. I just find it so strange that it use to be a national guard place. Given its recent history, I find that difficult to imagine.<//review>

I love that this space does tours of their facilities. The tour was perhaps a little too long but the tour guide was really great and friendly and she had a lot of fun tidbits about the building and the company that, err, films there. It was certainly a unique experience. I would love to take a friend there without warning them first :)< /Review>

Security actually do their job which is great. No parking for this venue unless you want to get to the parking lot across the street early- when we arrived parking was $50. Ended up parking 20 mins away. They only let you exit out of one door? Even though the place is surrounded by exits, youd think they'd want us out faster. Think of a giant gymnasium, that's this place.</Text>

Very amusing tour in this historic building! The tour guide was informative, open for all questions and we got to see a lot of different sets and props. Also got some neat inside information! Glad I did the tour! Next time I'll play an extra ;)<//review>

This place is a hoot! If  you are interested in SF history or how adult movies are made take the tour.

Please note the SF Armory is for adults only.< /text>

A really cool place.
A true porn studio in a historic building.
I recommend going for one of the tours.
Though it is a bit disapointing that we can not see porn being shot in real life.<//Review>

Company event here, with Weezer as the highlight entertainment. Sound was phenomenal, staff was kind and congenial, and the whole place was a great environment. Capped off a fantastic visit to San Francisco.</review>

Tour-
The building is beautiful and historical.  Interesting, but not worth the price of admission.

Our guide seemed disinterested and bitter.  She reminded us several times that piracy puts people out of work.  Felt a bit rushed.

I would wish I would have been there to see a set being built for device bondage or talked with some of the props people.</Review>

<review>Came here for a concert last weekend. The venue inside here is pretty massive. Way bigger than expected. While each concert may vary with experience, the venue itself was nice.

One thing that was lame was if you ordered a water they didn't let you keep the cap. So you had to drink it or hold it in your hand. Not sure if this is the venues rules or was a show specific one.

Either way, I would totally come back.</review>< pics>

It's ironic that this edifice built to suppress 'anarchists' should host the Anarchist Book Fair, but they do. It's also ironic that certain anarchists choose to boycott because this is arguably the largest niche film production studio in San Francisco. You can take a tour and watch films in the making. The tour price may seem steep (to me, anyway) but there are frequent 2 for 1 offers. American Conservatory Theater has presented a play here. Skateboarders give the front steps five stars and the walls are popular with urban ninjas.< /review>

We visited different sets on multiple floors including Dungeon (basement) and learned about history of the building, how it became home to not-a-movie studio and how it is being used these days.
Through the tour you will learn about porn studio operations, hiring, policies, workshops, community e.t.c.
Also it is a good chance to get detailed answers from professionals so feel free to ask ANY questions!
From other reviews and pictures I can tell that content of the tour can change depending on studio workload and guide, so your experience may differ.</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

R.e. their tour: Right from the start our tour guide Dane was a wonderful orator.
There was eight of us on the tour which was just the right size to be personal (I think they take up to thirty).

Despite being billed for ninety minutes we ran a little over (which was great, as I didn't want it to end!).
Dane was very conscientious the whole time, and never made us feel out of place. A wide range of subjects were covered from the building, to the company, to his personal accounts of what goes on 'behind the scenes'.
Asking questions was encouraged, never felt awkward, and always replied to in an knowledgeable and interesting way.

I would recommend to anyone with even the slightest interest!<//text>

Actually surprised at how well put-together their tours are - worth it! They also throw great events (NYE and Halloween) that are worth paying for. Just beware the lines on those larger event dates...get there early.< /Review>

Really amazing the breadth and depth of this building. Saw this on the Kink tour, though I hear they have a pretty fantastic halloween party. Inside there's a sort of weird cave and running river, basketball court, victorian outfittings, dungeons, old rooms where they used to store ammunition . Lots going on for a building.<//text>

I recently took a tour of this place and was thoroughly amused.  Where else in the world can you see something like this, nowhere to be exact!  Be forewarned only the openminded and accepting welcome.  Our tour guide was extremely hillarious and wouldn't think twice about locking someone in a cage.  Even as a mild kinkster I enjoyed myself.< /text>

Everything we have tried there has been great. My favorite thing to drink in the summer is the wine slushie. They have live music on certain nights. The owner is super nice. He always remembers my mom and I, even when it's been awhile. Definitely a place to eat if you're in Oakdale.< /review>< time>

The food here is amazing. Beautifully plated and most importantly, absolutely delicious. Highly recommend ordering the crostini for a starter. Topped with goat cheese, craisins, sweet and sour sauce and basil. A combination made in heaven. The lamb shank was also amazing. Great place, great atmosphere, great people.</review>

Tonight at Rivi's we experienced some of the best customer service we've ever had at any establishment thus far. We got to converse with the owner himself who made us feel like we were already long time friends. I will highly encourage all my friends and family to visit and enjoy their amazing food, wines and hospitality.<//text>

Oh my goodness, this is a hidden gem! So many differant atmospheres in this place. You can sit in a comforatable room with your friends on couches and chat, sit beside a gas firepit in an enclosed patio or in the dining area inside. I recommend the prime rib sliders! Great food friendly service.< /Text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>Been a customer for almost 10 years. Great service, wide range of products,and very patient with me. Been to other facilities before Dr. Wesson’s and didn’t get the treatment no where near what I received from his facility. Look no further!! This is the staff you need when it comes to hearing care. Believe me, they do care which is hard to find now days. They get an A+ from me . Six stars if it was available!!!<//text>< pics>

<Review>This is the best place to get hearing aids and the service is outstanding. There's good hearing, better hearing in Stockton,(terrible service) but this is the best. Wouldn't go any where else. Thanks Wesson hearing center.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Time>1597397306975</Time></record>

{'time': 1595896977580, 'text': "We are very sorry to here this. Upon looking at your file, we noticed the office staff tried to contact you 3 times and got a busy signal. Also, your hearing aids were registered to a different last name and were purchased from another company. This and the fact Phonak are furloughing employees due to Covid would slow down the process at the manufacture. A 2 week turn around on repairs is industry standard. While at your appointment today, you didn't bring any of this to our attention. I would have gladly had a conversation to fix any complaints you had. Unfortunately, we cannot program hearing aids purchased from another business without charging a fee. We suggest you visit the business you purchased them from and have them correct the warranty information. Thank you."}<//Response>

<Text>Wesson Hearing failed to; contact me when aids were repaired and returned, inform me that they do not support Phonak hearing aids from the start (thus forcing me to have to go to original hearing center anyway just to have my aids be functional or even charged), and also failed to show any accountability when settling the charges.

Overall highly dissatisfied and I do not recommend going here.</Text></record>

My hearing aids had an issue, they took mine in right away and gave a loaner set that was the same as I had, a week alter I got a call mine were ready and they gave me a new pair. Service and people are always friendly and they always take care of their customers well. If you feel like being treated like family come have your hearing needs taken care of here.</Review>

My wife has been wearing hearing aids for more than 25 years but her hearing has still slowly deteriorated. Her three-year-old hearing aids were helping but still so much sound, especially speech differentiation, was just lost to her. She read several articles about the Oticon Opn hearing aid, its new technology and the real success hearing loss sufferers had exxperienced with it. We were interested in more information about the Oticon product but Diane had not been particularly impressed with the level of interest or effort her most recent audiologist provided so we began to research hearing aid distributors. Thankfully, we read about Doug Wesson and his hearing aid centers in and around Manteca. Diane called for an appointment and was able to go to the Ripon location the next day. No money was exchanged but she left Wesson's office that day with Oticon Opn demo hearing aids to try! We never expected that kind of service. Diane wore the hearing aids a week and experienced life altering improvement in her ability to hear - and more importantly - to undertand speech. She hears things like rain and the furnace running now. She is delighted both with these new hearing aids and with Doug Wesson and his whole staff for their nonflagging support. If you have hearing aids that still leave you working too hard to try to understand speech, or most especially, if you have hearing loss but have never invested in hearing devices, we wholeheartedly recommend the new Oticon Opn product paired with the kindness and experience of the folks at Wesson Hearing Aid Center.<//Text>

Josh and Kayla made my painting experience as easy as it could possibly be. The roof of my car was oxidized and a real eye-sore and now it looks brand new again. My car is almost eleven years old, but I love it and they saved it for me. Everything they promised, they delivered on. I'm so happy driving my car now. I'll never let it get like that again. A big thanks to everyone who worked on my car at AutoCraft!!!<//text>

<Text>The people at AutoCraft were extremely helpful and very knowledgeable. I was treated very well from start to finish. Everything was clearly explained to me and all my questions and concerns were answered. Very nice facility and professional atmosphere throughout. I would definitely use them again or refer anyone in need of collision repair to them without a doubt. It's nice to know there are still people out there that take pride in the work they do.

<Review>I had my Toyota Camry in for a rear end accident which bent my trunk out of use, and damaged a rear light.  They beautifully restored my car, looking better than it was before the accident.  They have excellent customer service and are as friendly and as they are professionally.  Auto Craft delivers above & beyond expectations.</Review>< Pics>

I just moved to California, and so being an out of stater, I didn’t know which auto body shop I could go to that wouldn’t take advantage of a young girl. My classmates told me about them and so I took my car to get fixed and I’m glad I did! Their facility is like no other. It’s not gross and grungy like most others, instead it’s super clean and looks a lot like a car show room! They made everything so easy and even had a rental car I could use. I also loved how they communicated with me via phone and email. They did such a great job and even detailed my whole car. The staff was super sweet too and make me feel comfortable. 10/10 would recommend.<//text>

Awesome experience!!!! Our Silverado was double rear ended and ended up bending the frame!  It looks like new!  The hitch receiver had  a sentimental Harley Davidson piece that was made out of aluminum that they were able to straighten!</text>

This is my second experience with Autocraft to repair body damage and repaint. The work was excellent and the paint match was perfect. They take great pride in a job well done. I had a very restrictive time crunch on this last job and due to their hustle, it was ready a day early! I recommend them highly if you value your vehicle.< /review>

<Review>I have used Auto Craft twice now and have very pleased with the service and work that I received. This most recent experience was a front and repair from an unseen pothole in a parking lot the raised my bumper and broke the cover and fog lamps on my brand new vehicle. AutoCraft took care of everything for me including the small amount of unseen work that needed to be done that my insurance company did not include in their estimate (fog lamp bevels under the bumper wrap). They handled the additional charges directly with my insurance. The paint match on the graphite grey was impeccable. I’m sure you won't be disappointed if you choose AutoCraft to handle the repairs on your vehicle.<//Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
I've always used autocraft for all my auto body needs. The owner got us a rental one time when we called everywhere and no one had one. He will make a very bad situation not seem as bad. Let's say he takes the hard part and makes it as if it was his problem and he makes you feel like you are just there to get your car detailed.then before you know it your car is back and it's like nothing ever happened. It's kind of a good experience from r something that is such a bad thing to have to go through. I send everyone I know to these guys and I always will. Professional kind and generous is all words associated with the word autocraft< /Review>

Highly recommend this shop!
Derek in the office looked at the damage to my truck, took the time to explain what they would do, and why, and gave me a very accurate estimate on the spot. Very knowledgeable, and curteous. The work was Perfect! You can't tell there was ever any damage. I ran my hand over the dented area, you can't feel a thing, the metal work was Amazing, and the paint is perfect. The office staff kept me informed, and made everything so easy. Thank you so much!
I will definitely recommend them to everyone.<//Text>

These guys are awesome. They did not settle for the sub par replacement parts that the insurance company tried to approve. When it became apparent that the repairs were going to take longer than expected, they even contacted the insurance company to aquire a rental car. If you find yourself in the unfortunate situation of needing some auto body work, then come to the best shop on the Central Coast.< /Review>

<Text>I was pulling out of a parking space and sideswiped the car in front of me causing lots of cosmetic damage to the passenger side of my Mercedes SUV.  It has a specialty paint job and AutoCraft matched that paint and fixed the damage so I can't even tell where it started or ended.  They were professional and pleasant and got the job done in a timely manner.  My car looks like new.  They also had it detailed by Mike's Customized Detailing and it looked amazing inside as well.  Nice job AutoCraft!  Thank you!</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<Review>This is my 2nd vehicle to have body work, my 2006 Avalanche and my 2018 Silverado that someone backed into: the work on both were excellent. All the employees are professional and polite and I would highly recommend this body shop to everyone.  They do not cut corners and the quality of work is impressive: great job all, thank you again.<//Review>< pictures>

I had a list of issues with my car that were complicated and had looked into a few repair shops before deciding on Autocraft repair but I'm so glad I did. Everyone I felt with on their team was amazing and worked hard to get everything done in a timeframe that worked for me. I really appreciated the regular updates from them on how the repairs were going and how hard they worked to get me the best price on parts and labor. I've heard great reviews from friends that have used them in the past and I'm glad I listened. I would highly recommend them for any auto repair needs.< /Review>

AutoCraft Paso Robles provided professional (5 Star Plus) quality auto repair, and administration services. AutoCraft was highly recommended by my auto dealer, and others who have had autos restored/repaired at AutoCraft. The repair quality is "good as new". Tony and staff were over and above helpful, with co-ordination/resolution of insurance company issues. Tony and staff were also very helpful with co-ordination/provision of a replacement rental vehicle. Thank you Tony and staff at AutoCraft.< /Review>

I have used AutoCraft for two of my vehicles. They are an excellent company. My vehicles look like they have never been in an accident. They repaired, painted and even detailed cleaned my vehicles to perfection. They have great customer service and their work is guaranteed.  I will definitely come back if needed and recommend friends to them.<//Text>

It was the first time I have ever got in an accident with my Mercedes. AutoCraft in Paso Robles did a great job in repairing my car in a quick and professional time frame. They used OEM parts and made my car look newer and better, they kept me updated throughout the week with notification on my car and on what procedure they were on. Tony was very helpful and knowledgeable during the repair of my car and kept the best interest in keeping my car run like brand new. As well as Kayla being very helpful and friendly. If you are ever needing repairs on your car this is the number one spot to go! Thank you AutoCraft Crew!</Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>When my car had to be towed to AutoCraft Collision Repair, I did not know what to expect.  This was a 1st experience for me.  It began in the office with my telephone call (I'm so sorry, I forgot your name), reassuring me that it was going to be alright.  Then, with Tony, who walked me through the process.  He was patient and explained the process so that I could understand and to deal with the insurance company.  Lupe also called me along the way to keep me informed, again, very patient and explained the situation so that I was very well informed.
I'm hoping I never have to go through something like this again, but, if I have to have 'any' work in the future, I will request AutoCraft Collision in Paso Robles.
Great Work Team!  Thanks!<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

The work they did on the van turned out great. It took way longer than expected but that was mainly due to the insurance. They were never rude and stayed professional which is a big deal for me.</text>

Recently had a run in with a deer and dropped my car off with AutoCraft. The whole crew I came in contact with from the office to shop guys were very helpful and professional. The work and customer service provided by the team was top notch. Kayla made things super easy by providing updates via phone calls and text. If I had any questions, I texted Kayla and she was prompt in her responses. Overall, this shop is worth checking out.<//Text>

I went to Autocraft to get my car repaired after I was in a hit and run. From the beginning I was treated with absolutely top notch service! They got me in immediately for an estimate. Tony Flores walked me through the process and explained everything to me that they would need to do. I left feeling like I was in good hands. I had forgotten a few items inside the car and came back to retrieve them after dropping my car off for repairs. Kayla pointed out my school parking pass and asked me if I would also be needing that. A couple days later I asked to look in the car for a missing cellphone and they again allowed me to get into my car. When I went to look for the phone I had fully expected my car to be sitting on the lot waiting to be started, but it was already being worked on with the parts removed that were going to be fixed. I was definitely impressed with the whole experience. I highly recommend this company!<//Text>

I needed my vehicle repaired and wanted a place that would just handle what needed to be done.  Autocraft was that place,  I took it in, went through the estimate efficiently, and left in the ride the had coordinated for me, to the rental car place.  I received text updates on status with a call when it was ready to pick up.  It was ready in less than 2 weeks.  I went to pick it up, the work was excellent, the vehicle was cleaner than when I left it with them and all I needed to was sign a few papers and go.  Overall, great service, quality work and no friction to get the work done.< /review>

I took my truck to AutoCraft last Fall to remove a major dent from a golf ball. They did an excellent job & only charged me $65.00.
In March, another driver backed out of a parking space & smacked the side of my truck. I didn't even waste my time talking to other auto body shops. I went right to AC. The damages totaled almost $7,000. AC was 100% amazing start to finish. Their customer service went above & beyond. They communicated with me every step of the way. They walked me through the insurance process. And the end result is a truck that looks as good as new (it is a 2010 GMC). I would highly recommend them for all your auto body repairs.<//text>

Amazing job repairing my BMW M235i! Kayla was fantastic keeping me informed on progress and the guys (Tony & Ray) in the shop did a great job bringing the car back to pre-collision state, including perfectly matching paint. Highly recommend this team!< /Review>

<Review>I'd write a brand new update, but as things are, we got hit again.  I don't get a "Write a Review" link on google, just "Edit your Review".  This time, we got hit by a deer, front right bumper.  Back to Autocraft!

The repair service was filled with extraordinary delays of parts deliveries. What was most impressive is how diligent Autocraft was just in letting us know what was going on and getting the job done.

Our vehicle came back, once again, over-the-top in fine shape.

Sincerely, our heart-felt thanks for all their efforts!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This month was the third time (since we have owned the car)  we've had to bring in our beloved Leaf for repairs.  First two were over the front bumper, and this time was the rear bumper.  It didn't look too terribly bad, but went south from there.  I was so glad to have AutoCraft  taking diligent and expertise  care.  I have to say, the customer service from beginning to end  is 5 star amazing plus (thank you, Tony).  With that, we return for the fantastic work they do (and have done) with our vehicle.  Estimates are good, analysis of damage and insight into repair needs and costs well explained, rental car seamlessly arranged, and car repaired and returned like nothing had ever happened.  This will always be our first place of choice for collision repair needs.< /Review>< pics>

They kept me updated with the status of my repair and were always professional and friendly. Lupe and the rest of the staff made everything super easy for me and the quality of the repair was as if it was brand new.

I took my car here after it was broken into and needed a new window, all the staff went above and beyond to help with anything I needed. Lupe was such a huge help in dealing with my insurance company and keeping me updated on my car. I absolutely have nothing bad to say about this auto shop and would think twice about bringing my car back! Definitely would recommend.< /Review>

< Review>
First and foremost, Thank You to everyone that works in this establishment. These people are the other family members you never knew about. I went through the one of the worst experiences and stressful moments with my vehicle and everyone here was my shoulder to lean on for support, trust and understanding. One of the first things that I felt coming here was warmth and that welcoming feeling that lacks in basically every other business you approach for help and they treat you like a priority like you’re the only customer that they need to help even though they have many customers before you. They worry about your safety and have that desire to help you and lend a hand wherever they can. This whole process was a whirlwind of emotions, mostly bad but in the end, everything turned out just right. If I could wreck 20 more cars to take here just to get the same experience and care over and over , trust me I would. To the AutoCraft Collision family, I can’t thank you enough from the bottom of my heart for everything you did for me and for going the extra mile just to make sure I’m taken care of in one of my worst times of need. My new family for life.

The first day I went there I met Tony the estimator. What a pleasure Tony was. My truck was filthy. He actually took a detailer solution and wiped my whole truck down. Now who does that? From Ashley at the front desk, to Kieth I believe is the owner. I was impressed from the time I walked in. To when I drove my truck out. They did a beautiful job! They also detailed my truck from top to bottom. I don't write to many reviews. But I had to on this place. If you want a quality repair, with just great people. Take you car or truck to Autocraft!!!</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Great service.  They handled all insurance billing and rental car arrangements including pick up and drop off.  They did great repair work and the vehicle was completed when they said.  Very painless repair process and would highly recommend.  Thanks AutoCraft!< /review>

As a local Fleet Manager, I'm responsible for a fleet of commercial and non-commercial pickup trucks. I have used a couple of the other auto body shops in the Paso Robles area and had some disappointing results. When it came time to have work done on my own company truck, after a deer jumped in front of it, I decided to give Autocraft a shot. Best decision I could have made for many reasons: communication, quality, timeliness and courteous. I was always informed and updated by the service writers assigned to my truck. Everyone is really friendly and eager to keep you satisfied; from the folks in the office to the guys taking care of the repairs in the shop. I am a stickler for detail and was very impressed when I picked my truck up. Autocraft went above and beyond to touch up other issues they noticed with scratches and scuffs as well as detailing my truck to really accentuate the repairs they did...IT LOOKED BRAND NEW! I couldn't tell that anything had ever happened it. I highly recommend using Autocraft if you are wanting the absolute best in autobody repair, I know I have found my shop in town to take more fleet vehicles to when they need any sort of body work. You will not be disappointed!<//text>

<review>We have gone here twice now. The first time for just a front fender on my Ram Dakota, the 2nd for our Dodge Challenger, which had been blasted by a gravel truck. Autocraft took care of everything, from getting the insurance to cover more than their original estimate when more damage was found to providing a nice rental car that they have. Ashley in the front office is amazing, as well as the whole team. I highly recommend this business!< /review>< pictures>

Some how something had sprayed on the paint of my BMW and I had about 40 small spots which had eaten through the clear coat into the paint. This was on the hood, top, and trunk.I filed a claim and my insurance company and they denied it saying that it was just normal ware from driving around. Four months later, a friend recommended Auto Craft Collision to have a look at the paint damage. I met with Derek, he looked at the problem and he said it was some type of caustic material that most likely came from another vehicle on the freeway. I contacted my insurance company again with Derek's opinion and his photos of the damage and they accepted the claim to repair and repaint the vehicle. Auto Craft didn't just tape off things to paint around lights ect, they disassembled a lot of the vehicle to paint panels and around the edges. Their workmanship is of the highest standards and the car looks like new. Had it not been for Derek, I never would have got this repaired. He worked on my behalf with the insurance and got everything taken care of. A big thanks to Derek.</Text>

<time>1578785162656</time><Review>I am shocked that Office Depot continues to exist considering their pathetic service!  I purchased office desk and chair on 12/29 and told that I would receive delivery on 1/2.  No delivery but I got several text and phone calls delaying the delivery several times.  The most recent delivery would be for 1/13 , fourteen days after I paid for my merchandise in full!  I got a verbal confirmation from their local distributor, Ryder Final Mile, that my merchandise would arrive by Thursday, Jan 9th.  I waited all morning and finally called Ryder Final Mile here in the Bay Area and was told that I was not scheduled for today, but that in fact my shipment was cancelled!! They then offered the 20th as my arrival date, now 22 days after I paid for my merchandise in full!
I called Office Depot after my call with Ryder Final Mile and was told there was no cancellation on their end but they would escalate the issue .  All I can say is at this point I want my merchandise by Friday, January 9th!
I will keep you all posted. Meanwhile, think twice before buying from Office Depot and don't ever use Ryder Final Mile!
Update as Friday, Jan 10th. After assurances that my case was being escalated I had to call Office Depot myself to find out what the status of my order is.Now they tell me that someone will call me Monday to tell me when my shipment will arrive. I called them again and got a contractor named Brandi who gave me her email address to ask for updates. I emailed her and of course got no reply. Now I am on the phone with Office Depot and Ryder Last Mile and they are telling me there are no spaces on the truck at all. Sarah at Ryder is telling me I should have accepted the Jan 20th date even though they were supposed to deliver on the 2nd.  Worst customer experience!
Update still Friday: got Sarah at Ryder to again escalate my case and got Donna on the phone who finally told me my shipment would arrive tomorrow. I will post here if it does.
Update on Saturday: after another round of assurances from Yvette at Office Depot and Donna from Ryder Last Mile  I still have NOT received my shipment! Li edto again!!< /Review><Response>{'time': 1578929606786, 'text': 'Hi Anna, Thank you for bringing this Customer service issue to our attention.

Shopping experience was OK.  Store clearly has issues with maintaining inventory as many sections contained limited selection of merchandise or was completely bare.  Might go the way of Sears if they can't secure financing.<//text>

This was without a doubt the most depressing Office Depot I have ever been to, and I’ve been to dozens of office depots in numerous states including here in California. The layout, the other customers, the selection, everything was depressing.<//Review>

<Text>These guys are producing my favourite beers at the moment. Locks of Sif is the most drinkable blonde ale I've had in a long time and my wife loves the cider available here. They have a small outdoor seating area and some tasty sandwich style offerings at the moment. Absolutely must stop by.</Text><UserId.>110726005057905757607< /UserId.>< rate>

Cool low-key place. Glad they're finally open! Small food menu, but good beer. Having the oatmeal stout and it's tasty. Would be cool if there had a food connection with Mi Pueblo. Nothing wrong with tacos and beer in a viking brewery!</Review>

<review>The food and beer were both very good. The service was veeerrrry slowww! I finished my taster set before the food came out.  Maybe we hit them at an odd time. I would give them another try  because the food and beer were good.</review></record>

<review>Was told this was a great new brewery and we needed to try it. This business is destined to go the way of Old Redwood Brewing Company. Nothing special about the beer or food to recommend this brewery or too go back for. There are several breweries in this area to visit and even a couple to wait to get into within 5 miles of this business such as Bear Republic and Russian River.</review>< pics>

I’m not a business owner but if I were I’d post a phone number that someone would answer at. Especially two hours before the Warriors finals game 6. Was gonna check this place out and called three times around 430-5 pm to see if they have a tv and we’re gonna have the game on. Just rang and rang. Doesn’t make any sense to me.< /text>

Laid back customers come here for the laid back atmosphere. The outdoor seating is better than most places on this busy street. The food is an afterthought. Breakfast and lunch fare that a college student would be proud of cooking themselves.<//review>

Waitressses are clueless. There is a list to sign in and they don't even look at it. Others just cut in line and sit down on their own...they also move like snails. No sense of urgency at all...the food is great, though.<//text>

I absolutely love S.C. Cafe and the staff is so friendly and the food is excellent. Parking can be very tricky and the spot is a little hard to find. This hole in the wall cafe is definitely worth giving a try if you haven't been. I almost didn't want to review for selfish purposes of becoming to busy for me to be able to get parking and get in. Very quaint place.< /Text>

Delicious coffee and specialty coffee drinks!  There's usually quite a line, but so worth the wait.  (Oh, and check out their pastries!  I'm saving up the calories for one of their gigantic cinnamon rolls!)< /review>

Stopped in off interstate, great little breakfast nook! Super layed back, portions are pretty large so keep that in mind - they serve lunch all day which is a huge plus if you are not big on breakfast foods :-)</review>

<review>With the complete utter disrespect for cleanliness the server look like she just walked out of her bed or maybe she sleeps underneath the counter in the back her hair needs to be addressed when is waving around but anyways let me get to the point.  She gave me a water that had a 2 foot clear white hair on it which I then swallowed half way down to my throat and had a gag it up on the table.  Did not stay long enough to try the food.  Enter at your own risk.<//review><pics>None</pics><resp>{'time': 1493225389035, 'text': "Hi C,\n\nOur apologies for the hair in your water.

<text>This dispensary is great! I came in with my mother for patient appreciation day. They gave us 5G eighths and edibles. The bud tender was really cool and gave me 15% off my plug in play since the flower deal was the same as the first time deal. They’re open late nights and early mornings which I love! They have weed tacos for 4/20 so you know I’m pulling up. Great vibes always love you guys< /text>< pics>

today was my first time here and Chyna had helped me out. I usually go to the shop down the street but they were closed and I end up
Stopping here. The customer service here was amazing I really appreciate that because that is something that really matters. I had got the 5 gram eighth deal which was pretty cool. And also I had picked up their wax as well and got a great deal. The weed and everything here is really the best. I definitely will be cooking here more and will be here for the 4/20 event</review>

<Text>I came in for my first time to the west coast to visit with my brother and sister-in-law. I asked them where I could go to get some “items” for our 6 day hike and this was the random place my brother chose “his job does not allow any type of consumption” so I walk in and for my first time buying it- it was a pleasant experience! There is one particular employee (ALEX) was very knowledgeable and more than helpful in making sure I was happy with my decision. Once I made it back I needed to revisit and the girl there even remembered me (probably because I sound country AF I’m from WV) I highly recommend this place to anyone that is visiting this area. I couldn’t be any more pleased with this store. I plan on visiting my brother about 3-4 times a year and I am happy to say that they now have a customer for life! Thank you to Alex. Next trip is set for September 2021 and I hope the same people are working and can help me again! I hope the white recluse pre-rolls are still on point and burn slow!<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Came in to nwa and maxi help me out with some fire top shelf pre rolls. She told me to check in on Yelp and follow them on ig to get hooked up daily deals. They alway have great customer service and make sure you leave happy with you purchases. I found them on weedmaps. They have 5 gram 8th and live resin carts and wax. On daily deal you can get 50% off the wax. Starting at $5 bucks. The vapes here are real and cheap and they have cheap weed start at $20 cap. The guard are friendly and make sure we are all safe and it’s always clean in here. They wear gloves and mask to serve the patient so I’ll definitely say you have to come see the best dispensary in Compton< /Review>< Pictures>

Best customer service by dory! She showed me top shelf flower as well as strains off of their 20cap shelf! The edibles they carry smack too like the STNDRD and Galaxy! But my favorite are the gnarly cupcakes and the live resin carts they carry ! All CDC guidelines followed!</Review>

always come here and I love it it’s one of the best dispensaries in Compton and I’ve been to a few. It’s a 20 cap shop for sure! Ang always comes and serves me with great costumer service. They  have really good deals on the moonrock and the stndrd edibles. I came in today and bought some moonrock along with the stiiizy carts & plug n play. I always leave here satisfied. Plus they keep the place clean and sanitized. They keep gloves on and they always have their mask on. They have cheap weed and deals on literally everything including edibles. This is a place that I will forever be loyal to. PREROLLS WEEDMAPS CHEAP WEED BUD SHOP ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️<//review>

Chyna had served me today and was very friendly. This was my first time coming here and I really appreciate everything. I had came here and got the first time deal and they were really good about it because most shops really be stingy with the deal. I had got a 20 cap and it was really fire. This is definitely my new spot in Compton to go to always. I had also bought a couple of half gram stiizys and got one free that was really a good deal. I really appreciate everything ladies I definitely will be being a friend in so we can get some great deals.<//Text>

<Review>This is my favorite dispensary, not only in Compton but out of the entire LA county, okurrr! Buds are always fire & they stay with quality $20 eighths. Nowadays it’s hard to even find an eighth at $20! The customer service is A1 like steak sauce, make sure you ask for Curley Jae! All the ladies are sweet & great with customer service which keeps me coming back everytime! Stop by on their patient appreciation days that fall on the 2nd & 16th of each month. Come check out my late night dispensary for the dispensary deals !!<//Review><Name>Miyana Jones</Name></record></dataset><record>

<rating>5<//rating><text>I came in today looking for the best flower deals. This is the closest cannabis store to me so I had to give it a try. Juice and tiny hooked it up with a killer deal I walked out with everything I need and some. The best bud shop in Compton by far. The madras vapes are the cheapest I’ve found in a LOONG time! Like wow.  Not only did I get a freebie for my purchase but happy hour too? The best customer service. Thank you ladies<//text>< pics>

This dispensary always got the best deals ever this is why I love coming here. Mc helped me out and had hooked me up with a deal and I got 10% off edibles. I had picked up the medicated canna candys and they are really good and had got me really high for 100mg of thc. I usually come in and pick up the standard gummies but she had put me on something new. This is really the best dispensary ever in Compton I really appreciate the customer it’s always the best. Check them out on Weedmaps as well to see the variety of everything they got!! Also check them out on the 2nd of june they are having amazing 5 gram eighth deals! Best 5 grams for $20 I've ever had! And got a moonrocks joint for only 10 dollars as an upgrade! After she still hooked me up with a free dab for spending over 75 here! This is my #1 go to late night dispensary!!!</text>

I just found a late night 20 cap dispensary in Compton on weed maps today. They have the best prices on west coast cure pods and plug n plays which i stocked up on today. They also gave me an upgrade on my eighth for a half gram of wax. They also give out free dabs with a donation and pre rolled joints. I also picked up a one of a kind glass bong as a gift for my friend they gave me a great  discount on it for my first time! Bratz was amazing and helped me out with my entire transaction ! I’ll be back soon< /review>

The experience overall was excellent. Customer service is very good, I always feel welcomed. The bud tenders  are knowledgeable of the cannabis product and are always of great help. And lastly the strains of bud are without a doubt the best and there is a variety of selections for indicas, sativas and hybrids. Thank you! A very happy patient here.<//review>

She adding me to the text deals so I can get exclusive coupons. When I came in I was glad to see all the worker had on gloves and mask. They welcome me in and all the patients in line seem to really enjoy coming here. When I was checking out the board I notice they had a lot of options for $20 caps including moonrock. I saw they are planning a 420 sale starting 4/19 and I definitely will be here to get medicated taco Tuesday. Maxi help me out today and she told me I’ll be getting 9 grams for $35 on some fire flower. She gave me 2 free weed grams for being a first time patient deal. I also check out the house wax and it was fire and I got a free dabs with my donation. If your looking for a dispensary deals that will have you hooked and get the best customer service  this is the best cannabis store near me.< /Text>< pics>

<Review>I love it here this is my first time here and they showed me so much love. Cookie helped me out and had the best customer service I have ever experienced. Aside of that this is the best dispensary near me with so many options of weed and deals. I couldn’t choose they have so many upcoming 4/20 deals they have one of my favorite sativa stains called blue dream. They have cool moon rock joints and also CBD vapes as well! I loved everything about the place it was very clean and real organized I will definitely be coming back with more friends!!!</Review>< user>

Angie helped me out today and gave me the run around for my first time and hooked me up with a plug n play live resin cart and gave me 15% off. They have a dab bar here also and gave me a free dab for spending money here! They have a variety of things here from wax, edibles, moonrock joints, and CBD EDIBLES AND BUD. Now I have found my new late night dispensary that stays open til midnight. I got a nice bong for my first trip here today. I'll for sure be back to see you for your patient appreciation day and get me another fire 5 gram eighth! Look for ang she will take care of yall with much information that I didn't even know about!</text><UserId.>116154878200130949401</UserId.>< pictures>

Shout out to the bud tender Honey who helped me out.. she made sure every deal I could get I got and got the best looking smelling nugz you could ask for!
After that she proceeded to take me on a shop tour giving me all kinds of goodies based on the amount I spent. Idk if all the bud tenders are this friendly but she was a great representative of this shops product and staff. I will be coming here again.< /Review>

Chyna had told me to come here on Saturday for the deal on the wax today and here I am then had such an amazing time the customer service is the best I notice the selection of edibles had grew even more. Usually I just get the standard only but this time she had me try the galaxy gummy and they were amazing as well. Everyone should check this dispensary in Compton out they will get you right. Check them out on Weedmaps to see the selection of weed and more! Yes< /review>

The coolest cannabis store near me🔥 I always feel so welcomed and joyful when I step in this Compton dispensary. Sometimes I just stop but because they are the only spot with free dabs near me, I love it. I always feel hooked up. No other late night dispensary provides quality service, cheap weed, Plug n Play, etc... This last time I was in there, there was a line so one of the girls sparked up a danky moonrock joint and passed it to us! It’s always a vibe in here. Thanks to Jules, I tried a live resin cart for the first time and I fell in love! It’s a potent high in discretion which is just what I was searching for. Check them out, specifically west coast cure!! Ya won’t regret it. My favorite the best in town</Review>

I always come here and I love it it’s one of the best dispensaries in Compton and I’ve been to a few. It’s a 20 cap shop for sure! Chyna always comes and serves me with great costumer service. They  have really good deals on the moonrock and the stndrd edibles. I came in today and bought some moonrock along with the stiiizy carts & plug n play. I always leave here satisfied. Plus they keep the place clean and sanitized. They keep gloves on and they always have their mask on. They have cheap weed and deals on literally everything including edibles. This is a place that I will forever be loyal to. PREROLLS WEEDMAPS CHEAP WEED BUD SHOP ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️< /text>

I was looking for a dispensary near me that have $20 eighths and i’m so happy i found this marijuana shop near me! I came in on a budget looking for some cheap weed. I got a 5G eighth for my first time and a free dab! Dory really hooked it up.  They have everything here y’all, $25 eighths, Plug n Play, moonrock joints, west coast cure joints, bongs, friendly tenders & a great selection. I will for sure be returning! Especially since they have a deal running every day and coming foe Mother’s Day They are also a late night dispensary!! No other Compton dispensary is open till midnight like them! They really are the best in the city.</Text>

Thos shop is a wonderland in Compton. Nice budtender that knows their stuff and they have the best weed in the area. I got the pennywise og and they invited me to patients appreciate day on Wednesday the 16 of Sept, I'll be back to vet that Bogota one stiiizy pod deal. Also check out their sourz gummies. It's a really great price with a upgrade. Ask for maxi, she the best</Review>

<text>This dispensary always got the best deals ever this is why I love coming here. Angie helped me out and had hooked me up with a deal and I got 10% off edibles. I had picked up the medicated canna candys and they are really good and had got me really high for 100mg of thc. I usually come in and pick up the standard gummies but she had put me on something new plus I was getting the 50% off for the daily deal. This is really the best dispensary ever in Compton I really appreciate the customer it’s always the best. Check them out on Weedmaps as well to see the variety of everything they got!! Also check them out on the 15th they are having gnarly deals! Best 5 grams for $20 I've ever had! And got a moonrocks joint for only 10 dollars as an upgrade! After she still hooked me up with a free dab for spending over 75 here! I will be here for your 420 party</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Best dispensary in Compton. It’s my birthday and I came it with $5 and maxi hooked me up with a fire 20 cap gram and a big cupcake edible. I like the service here and they have great deals . I also got some fire top shelf joints. They are open early morning dispensary and this weed shop is full of great brands. Ask to see their live resin carts from stiiizy and wcc. The wax collection is huge with good daily deals. Thank you for making my birthday fire nugz with attitude</text>

Quick & easy located dispensary found in Compton. They have cheap buds, great customer service & even a large selection of vape products. Recommend everyone to come here & ask for curly to be your bud tender. The edibles are fantastic with high percentages, checkout the standard gummies & sourz edibles!</Text>

<Review>Best dispensary in Compton. I found them on weedmaps when I was looking for 5 gram eighth. They was open late night dispensary and I was able to come in last minute. Maxi help me out with a great deal on 3 full gram stiiizy carts . She said they carry the best live resin carts in town. I like how they follow cdc rules and wear gloves and mask. This marijuana store had the best customer service I’ve ever seen in a weed shop. I felt appreciated the how visit by the whole staff. The guard even makes you feel safe while your there by staying on the floor and calming down issues before it starts. I’ll be making this my go to shop for now on</Review></record>

chyna had helped me today and really gave me a good understanding since i’m new. i really appreciate the first time experience. I originally came in here to buy a wax pen they didn’t have the brand i wanted but i end up trying a dime cart and that was a great choice ! what i really like about this dispensary is they have a great selection of everything even cbd pens i will definitely try one next time since they have a lot of benefits. i also appreciate the freebies they gave i got a 250 mg chief treat edible and it’s fire !!! thank you guys this is the best dispensary in compton i definitely recommend this to anyone and go ahead and check them out on weedmaps also ! will be back on patient appreciation day on the second for the crazy deals on wax and weed😍< /review>

Best dispensary in Compton, Angie helped me out with some fire 20 cap! Looked them up on weedmaps and boom I’m here! I got to pick up some live resin cure pods! And got a fire live resin dab. They hooked me up with a fire pre roll and edible for the first time! They have the best customer service in ever!<//Review>

<text>Shoutout to Dory for making my first time experience really good. I usually go to the dispensary across the street but that dispensary was closed so I went on Weedmaps and found this place. I was so amazed that they had a dab bar I haven’t seen one in years !!! The deals they got here is amazing I had bought some fire for 20 a cap and on top of that I had came on patient appreciation day so I got a crazy deal and end up getting 5 grams for $20!!! I also had end up trying a Juicy joint the one that’s wrapped in keef and it was so fire and the best part is I only paid $5 and regular price goes for $15!!! Because here they do upgrades when you buy a Eighth or more. Keep the customer service up guys it’s wonderful and I will definitely be bringing more people in so I can continue getting that great deal with the 5 grams.</text></record></dataset><record>

This is the only marijuana shop you need to go to because they have it ALL! Dab bar, west coast cure carts, great customer service, great deals, Plug n Play and more… I like to come during happy hour because they give a deal on whatever you’re looking for. It’s always a good time when I come in here because the staff is so genuine and helpful. I would definitely recommend them to a friend or family member who’s looking to try cannabis for the first time or is already a connoisseur. You won’t get let down! Number 1 on weedmaps compton</Review>

Maxi hooked me up with some exclusive popcorn for 20 cap. Its their best buds all together and you get super high on it. Look them up on weedmaps to see their menu. They have fire live resin carts like sticky and West coast cure. I bring my puppy here because they are a pet friendly dispensery. Ask for the honey cocaine og , its one of my favorite bud shop.  They have the best dispensery near me on customers service and I'm always satisfied with the experience here.<//Text>

Best dispensary in compton, look them up on weedmaps. They have great daily deal and 20 cap special. Ask for cookie and maxi. They are my #1 and #2 hands down. They tell me they best deal for my money and they hook it up. I come in with a bad attitude and they will make sure I leave super happy by reminding me that everything will be ok and they get me some fire to help me feel good and they give me great customer support. I love this compton dispensary. Ask how to get 5 gram 8th and try the $5 upgrade for some fire gifts. And make sure you spend the wheel. Thanks guys for making my day 😍<//Review>

I really enjoyed coming here but after this I will no longer spent a dime at this location I spent over $100 this vape was half empty first of all they sold me pods and didn’t explain I had to buy a battery I had to go back then I call them to see if they can do anything for me because is not right the employee who answered was very rude no apology what so ever she hung up the phone and didn’t care if you visit this place make sure you check your products before stepping out the door.the product is cracked as you can see on the photos the last picture is the other side of the pod is completely dry<//Text>

I came to this dispensary in compton ca and was helped out by juice today. She gave such great customer service skill she knew all about the Stiizy carts I love the gelato one and you guy had have an full grams.  They also have live resin witch is strong at a low price. If your in the compton this is near you. The weedshop was very clean and they also carry the plug and plays. When I checked out they gave me a free pre-roll. I love it here it super cheap an net by my house.<//Review>

Nwa is the nearest dispensary near me. The best bud shop in Compton by far! The cannabis is always fire! The cheapest weed prices and best deal on stiizy carts. The pre roll selection is amazing and will definitely be back. Tiny hooked it up thank you !< /Review>

<review>This is really the best dispensary ever in Compton, I come here all the time for the $20 8ths but today Chyna had told me about the dub deals and I end up doing that for some fire weed. They always got the best deals ever all the time and definitely will not disappoint you. They have everything at this dispensary from edibles and also CBD items they have an amazing selection of that so you guys definitely gotta check it out. I found them on Weedmaps.<//review>< Name>

<review>Came to the nearest dispensary near me and nugz came right up. I came for the stiiizy deals and got my second one for only 20! The selection of pre rolls and bongs are fire!. I found them on weed maps and I’m glad I picked this shop over all the others. Next time I want to try the standards. Tiny has amazing customer service, see you guys on the 16th</review>< pics>

I come here all the time for just flower usually but Chyna had talked me into trying some fire  wax for the weed I had bought. What I really like what you can do is once you buy weed the price gets knocked down for the wax. This dispensary never disappoints me ever they will make sure you will leave out of here with what you want. I can’t wait to see what’s up with the patient appreciation day coming up on the 2nd they always got them poppin plus with the great deals.< /text>

This dispensary always got the best deals ever this is why I love coming here. Chyna had helped me out and had hooked me up with a deal and I got 10% off edibles. I had picked up the medicated canna candys and they are really good and had got me really high for 100mg of thc. I usually come in and pick up the standard gummies but she had put me on something new plus I was getting the 10% off for the daily deal. This is really the best dispensary ever in Compton I really appreciate the customer it’s always the best. Check them out on Weedmaps as well to see the verity of everything they got!!</Text>

This cannabis shop has the biggest selection of weed and at such a cheap price. Ive tried so many shops on weedmaps, but nothing came close to nwa. The top shelf pre rolls are stright fire and the cannabis quality is more than expected. Next time I come I definitely will be teyinf the Madre vapes ang suggested.

<Text>I came to this dispensary for the first time last week. Brix really hooked me up with the first time deal. I left with more free items than I what I actually bought. Service was great! When I got home and tried everything the quality was 100% I will definitely be going back to this dispensary. It is well worth the 20 min drive from where I live. The free dab was 🔥🔥 too. Everyone was super friendly. Hoping Brix is always there when I go because she was super nice and I also appreciated the social distancing.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Check them out , they open from 8an to 12 midnight they have the best live resin wax starting at 5 dollar with a combo deal ask about there daily deal and get hooked up every day at the best weed shop in Los Angeles. Cheap weed. Bongs for raffle. Many many more!< /Text>

<Text>Juice had helped me out and was really the best. She took her time explains everything and really had good customer service I love the vibe. They literally have everything that you need in this shop for all the prices. There’s not too many shops that have $15 8th and that’s amazing. I had bought a Dime cart for my first time I usually buy something called a oc pharm pen which they have but I went out and tried something new. She had also gave me this really good tasting edible by LA famila for free !!! For spending more than $75. This is going to my number one shop to go to in Compton I will always be coming here. Check them out on Weedmaps as well for the selection they have they really have everything even CBD pens for those who only do CBD!! Thank you guys again for the experience will be back soon with a friend also for the party on the 2nd< /Text>< user_id>

Found them on weedmaps. Maxi hooked me up with a free top shelf of gram of weed shop. This is the best dispensary in compton. They carry live resin carts in stiiizy and great bogo daily deals on vapes and edibles they have 5 gram 8ths and 50% off deals. Ask for a top shelf joints for free and they are open late night weed shop< /Review>

Chyna had told me to come here on the 16th and here I am then had such an amazing patient appreciation day. I notice the selection of edibles had grew even more. Usually I just get the standard only but this time she had me try the galaxy gummy and they were amazing as well. Everyone should check this dispensary in Compton out they will get you right specially with the fire $20 cap and $1 dabs for happy hour. See y’all on the second for the next patient appreciation day!!<//review>

Found them on weekmaps and I'm so impressed with the great 20 caps and quality of their bud. Max hooked me up with a fire free 32% thc gram for being a loyal patient. Im so appreciate that I apart of this best dispensary near me. They have the best customer service and deal I've ever seen. I tried the live resins cart and I can say it's high in quality.

The coolest cannabis store near me🔥 I always feel so welcomed and joyful when I step in this Compton dispensary. Sometimes I just stop but because they are the only spot with free dabs near me, I love it. I always feel hooked up. No other late night dispensary provides quality service, cheap weed, Plug n Play, etc... This last time I was in there, there was a line so one of the girls sparked up a danky moonrock joint and passed it to us! It’s always a vibe in here. Thanks to Ang, I tried a live resin cart for the first time and I fell in love! It’s a potent high in discretion which is just what I was searching for. Check them out, specifically west coast cure!! Ya won’t regret it. My favorite</text>

Love this place. People are awesome and tree is fire. I highly recommend this place. I had went to chyna and she really hooked it up with the daily deal they had today! I had got a 4 gram 8th today which is pretty cool and the beat part is that they have deals like this all the time. This will always be the best shop ever in Compton there customer service is always good and you will not leave this shop disappointed at all. They are really COVID safe everyone is wearing masks and gloves which I think is very important. Check them out on Weedmaps they got some bomb stuff!!< /text>

I was looking for a dispensary near me and found this one! My whole experience from checking in to walking out was so dope! I came looking for some cheap weed honestly & got hooked tf up. I got a 5G eighth for my first time and a free dab! They have everything here y’all, $20 eighths, Plug n Play, moonrock joints, west coast cure carts, bongs, friendly tenders & a great selection. I will for sure be returning! Especially since they have a deal running every day. They are also a late night dispensary!! No other Compton dispensary is open till midnight. The best in the city. Look for angie always has the best recommendations for my needs.< /review>

Best bud shop in Compton! There are many shops near me but new has the cheapest weed deals and biggest selection of pre rolls! This cannabis shop tops every Compton shop, the customer service is amazing and tiny helped me and hooked me up with fire top shelf joints and the most delicious Sourz editables. Did I forget to say they have the best editbles as well!?! I recommend the standard gummies 🤤 thank you guys< /review>

The best Compton dispensary you can go to! I’m so glad weedmaps near me helped me find this location because I had an amazing experience. From the receptionist, to the bud tenders (especially cocoa) , to the weed quality, everything is on point!! I like that they carry $25 eighths because I’m balling on a budget. Who doesn’t love cheap weed? They have the coolest bongs, lit dab bar and the best moonrock joints. The give free dabs with $20 donations too. There’s no comparison here. I got a 5 gram eighth for being a first timer, a couple joints & an invitation to their next party on Feb. 2nd which I’ll definitely be attending! Can’t wait. If you want to try a new Compton cannabis dispensary, look no further.< /Review>

Looked up the nearest cannabis shop in Compton ans nwa came right up, with all the great reviews i had to check it out. This cannabis shop has the biggest selection of weed and at such a cheap price. Ive tried so many shops on weedmaps, but nothing came close to nwa. The top shelf pre rolls are stright fire and the cannabis quality is more than expected. Next time I come I definitely will be teyinf the Madera vapes tiny suggested. Amazing experience thank you<//text>

I usually go to the dispensary across the street but that dispensary was closed so I went on Weedmaps and found this place. I was so amazed that they had a dab bar I haven’t seen one in years !!! The deals they got here is amazing I had bought some fire for 20 a cap and on top of that I had came on patient appreciation day so I got a crazy deal and end up getting 5 grams for $20!!! I also had end up trying a Juicy Joint the one that’s wrapped in keef and it was so fire and the best part is I only paid $5 and regular price goes for $15!!! Because here they do upgrades when you buy a Eighth or more. Keep the customer service up guys it’s wonderful and I will definitely be bringing more people in so I can continue getting that great deal with the 5 grams.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

Maxi was my budtender and she hooked me up with a 20 cap 8th that was sticky and smell so good. She told me I can get a 5 gram 8th on March 2 for a appreciation day and they will have bogo deals on edible and vapes. She said ask for the live resins carts cuz they taste the best and are at a great price. Come see them for your early morning dispensary</text>< pics>

They had an amazing PAD today !!! I come here all the time for edibles  but Chyna had talked me into trying some wax for the weed I had bought. What I really like what you can do is once you buy weed the price gets knocked down for the wax. This dispensary never disappoints me ever they will make sure you will leave out of here with what you want. I can’t wait to see what’s up with the patient appreciation day coming up on the 16th they always got them poppin plus with the great deals. Check them out on Weedmaps also.< /text>

Fire! I found a fire 20 cap dispensary on weed maps and it was nearby in Compton. They hooked me up with a fire 5gram eighth on the top shelf. They have the highest thc percentages in the city. I picked up a west coast cure 3 pack of joints that were hella dank. Bratz helped me out with some fire edibles from stndrd and invited me back to a 5G eight party. I’ll be back soon</Review>

<name>Elvisreyes Nichols Dar<//name><rate>5<//rate><text>Shoutout to Chyna for making my first time experience really good. I usually go to the dispensary near my house but that dispensary was closed so I went on Weedmaps and found this place. I was so amazed that they had a dab bar I haven’t seen one in so long !!! The deals they got here is amazing I had bought some fire for 20 a cap and on top of that I had came on patient appreciation day so I got a crazy deal and end up getting 5 grams for $20!!! I also had end up trying a Juicy Joint the one that’s wrapped in keef and it was so fire and the best part is I only paid $5 and regular price goes for $15!!! Because here they do upgrades when you buy a Eighth or more. Keep the customer service up guys it’s wonderful and I will definitely be bringing more people in so I can continue getting that great deal with the 5 grams..love this place< /text></record></dataset><record>

I brought in a first timer and they got a discount on their bong. The dab bar is honestly my favorite part next to my budtender Sugar who offered me a bunch of desls . Everyone in there is sweet , but the deals are sweeterrr . BEST compton dispensary!!!<//review>< date>

Customer service is always great here. Thanks ladies! I found the shop on Weedmaps, it is the closest cannabis dispensary near me. They are also a late night dispensary open until 12am. They carry brands like STIIZY, DIME, & WCC<//review>

Nugz with attitude is the hottest out right now. They have amazing weed and the best customer service honestly the best dispensary in Compton they have so many different options of weed and amazing deals everyday. My favorite strain from the week was Gary Payton and if you know your weed you know that’s one of the best out. I love how they keep there shop up to par with decorations and keep it clean I would love to bring all my friends here to have the same experience<//review>

I love this Compton Dispensary! They run deals every day on every product you can think. Products like Plug n Play, Live Resin Carts and moonrock joints! They recently got this brand West Coast Cure and I looove it! I love their joints and they a deal when you buy 2. I found this spot online when I googled weedmaps near me. And it's also the customer service for me! All the ladies here are so friendly and knowledgeable in cannabis. They always hook me up with a dab from the the dab bar during my visit as well. It's just such a good vibe her! You need to check them out....</review>

Came to this late night dispensary in Compton because they offer $1 dabs bar . Chyna  helped me out with the first time patient deal. I got 5 grams of marathon og and a gram of moonrock for only $30 bucks. Chyna showed me some fire bongs on sale and she told me to come party with them on april 2 for appreciation day. I’ll definitely say this is the beat weed shop in Compton. They have a lot of selection in live resins carts like stiiizy and now they carry raw garden battery. Come get taken care of with the best service in town and make sure you have your mask when you come. And check them out on Weedmaps!! And be sure to pull up for there 4/20 party</Review>

She showed me the Supreme OG and I had to cop an eighth. It’s Sunday so I got 4grams for it! Check them out it’s a good shop and they follow covid guidelines. Dope!< /text>

I picked up a plug n play cartridge and they have the best price for them in the city. They have tons of variety of flowers and edibles including stndrds and sweeter high edibles. I had moonrocks for the first time for a $10 upgrade and it’s my new vibe ! Bratz and the girls did an amazing job this is my new go to<//Text>< pictures>

They have a variety of products and the best customer service in the city. I was so happy to find plug n play & west coast cure carts here! They also have stiizy carts. If you're looking to pick up any of the following, come on Thursdays because they give vape deals every Thursday. On Tuesday you get a 4.5 gram 8th of any shelf which is awesome. Sunday you can get a 4 gram 8th come during happy hour 4:20-6:20. Sometimes I'll just come in to hit the dab bar or pick up a couple moonrock joints. Whatever it is I'm looking for, I come to this cannabis store for it cause they got it all! Thanks to Evelyn and all the girls here for their hospitality and warm energy!! Check them out people you will not regret it they got edibles vapes wax bongs etc anything you need they got even the packwoods. Btw they open as early as 8am and close at 12am everyday which is awesome.

The best Compton dispensary you can go to! I’m so glad weedmaps near me helped me find this location because I had an amazing experience. From the receptionist, to the bud tenders, the weed quality, the cleanlines, everything is always perfect!! I like that they carry $30 carts for my pen. They have the coolest pipes, great dab bar and the best moonrock deals. They give free dabs with $20 donations !!! I really do love it here. my first time I got a 5 gram eighth, a couple fire joints & an invitation to their next party on Feb. 2nd which I’ll definitely be attending so i can get another 5g eighth, Can’t wait. If you want to try a new Compton cannabis dispensary, look no further. As you can see, they always got the deals.<//Text>

I found this shop on weed maps and i’m definitely coming back! I came for a stiiizy cart and learned that they have live resin carts too! Chyna hooked me up with a buy 2 get 1 free deal and some la familia edibles. Those edible taste soooo good! They have vape deals on their patient appreciation so i’m coming back to try a plug n play<//text>

< review>
I found this dispensary on weedmaps and I was greatly satisfied! I was looking for some cheap weed and got a great 20 cap! I got a fire gram and a gram of moonrock all for just 20!!! I also was impressed to see that they carry all my favorite vape products like stiiizy, plug n play and madres vape! I also sampled their gnarly cupcakes which were sooo good! I recommend them to everyone. They have happy hour 3 times a day where you can get a dab from their dab bar for just a DOLLAR! Sooo fire! They have a wide variety of prerolls & sourz edibles as well. They have it all! Thanks for all your help really appreciate it!! I will definitely be coming back to this shop. Check em out If your looking for cheap weed then you need to come check them out, the 20 cap Compton shop don’t have nothing compared to NWA 20 cap shelf. It smells and looks like it should be price higher. I always get high from everything I choose here and I also get the sourz edibles, my favorite so far is Stndrd gummies. They get you so high and you don’t crash at all. If your looking on weedmaps for a weed store that will have everything you need, this Compton dispensary will end up your everyday go to. Thank you Angie for hooking me up with some new edibles to try, I’ll be back tomorrow to let you guys know what I thought about them.</review>

If yu haven’t been to N.W.A you’re missing out. It has three leagues ahead of your traditional herbal dispenser. I highly recommend coming here before going to any of your regular shops. I promise you won’t be disappointed. And the girls are all very pretty that’s a win-win for me</Text>

<text>I always come here and get hooked up forreal!! I love all the staff, especially Jules that’s my girl! Sometimes I just come for a dab because this is the only spot with a dab bar near me. I also come here for their buy 2 get 1 free on stiiizy , stndrd , sourz edibles and prerolls. They have cheap weed and supreme weed, whatever your heart desires!! I love coming on their patient appreciation days because it’s like a big party with freebies for everyone! This is the only Compton dispensary you need to go to. They have all the good cannabis products and the best customer service. If you bring a friend as a referral, you and your friend get a bomb deal. This place is great! I found them on weedmaps.</text></record>

I come here all the time. The customer service and the flower they have is amazing. I love the 4/20 party they have I already knew it was gonna be the best. What I really like about this shop is that they always have deals going on all the time anytime and the prices is for everyone. I always pick up the Marathon Og but they have some new stuff called Hardcore OG and it is fire. Chyna has been telling me about vapes for the longest and I’m definitely going to try it tomorrow for the buy one get one free you can’t go wrong with that. Keep up the good work ladies!</text>

<Review>I found this Compton dispensary on weedmaps today so I decided to stop by because I was looking for stiiizy & stndrd products & I saw they carry them! As soon as I walked in I was greeted by all staff! That really stood out to me because you don’t get that kind of customer service at any other bud shop around here. Jules was great help during my visit today. She told me I’d really like Madres vape & plug n play since I like stiiizy. I’m going to get both my next visit for sure!!! She hooked me up with prerolls and I got a dab from their dab bar before I left. I had such a great experience here so this is going to be my number one shop now! Open late & they have everything you’d possibly need! 1 stop shop with awesome customer service and great deals too. Check them out!<//Review>< Pictures>

So far, best dispensary near me!! I smoke vapes and this shop has all the fire brands like madres vape, stiiizy, plug n play and some 20 cap selection of some fire cheap weed! Who doesn’t want more for their bucks?! I know I do, they have a 10 dollar upgrade of moonrock of kief prerolls. Check them out on weedmaps! I picked up a 5 gram 8th for my first time visit and got a bomb free dab from their dab bar. All the girls here are so cool. Customer service is on point! Shout out to Jules for her kindness!<//Text>

This is the best dispensary near me! I’ve been to a lot of bud shops in Compton but this one blows the rest out the water! Here’s why, the staff is more than helpful & polite, they always have a great deal running on their supreme weed, prerolls, stndrd gummies, moonrocks, stiiizy carts, wax & they got cheap weed!  They even have a nice selection of CBD here. 20 cap options are also available. It’s great because they have products for everyone. One stop shop!!! They have a dab bar running all day too, like whaaat!! The only spot I know with a functioning dab bar near me! I just wanted to say shout out to Jules for putting me on to the galaxy gummies. They are so good and taste just like sourz edibles. I found this spot on weedmaps. This is my new spot, I’ll never go anywhere else!</review>

<Text>If your looking for Compton cannabis shop, Nwa is the best dispensary near me. They have the best brands in cartridges like madres vape, plug n play cart, stiiizy carts and stndrd carts. I can’t wait until they get the mooonrock carts too but I love how they have the color carts as a choice carts.  If your looking for cheap weed at a great quality then you have to come check out their 20 cap shelf. I’m always finding some fire bud there. It’s sticky and smells so good. You also get free prerolls with every purchase. And for only $5 you can add a sourz edibles to your bag. Definitely the best weedmaps near Compton. Thanks guys for always making me feel taking care of, cookie always hooks me up with all the deals they are promoting and I really appreciate you guys.<//Text><user_id>103059288261864321887</user_id>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Coming to nwa is like walking in a weed wonderland, the shop is always clean and following CDC guild lines. The weed collection is huge and they have something for everyone. If your looking for cheap weed then you need to come check them out, the 20 cap Compton shop don’t have nothing compared to NWA 20 cap shelf. It smells and looks like it should be price higher. I always get high from everything I choose here and I also get the sourz edibles, my favorite so far is Stndrd gummies. They get you so high and you don’t crash at all. If your looking on weedmaps for a weed store that will have everything you need, this Compton dispensary will end up your everyday go to. Thank you Angie for hooking me up with some new edibles to try, I’ll be back tomorrow to let you guys know what I thought about them.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>{'time': 1607970134040, 'text': 'We appreciate your continued support!

This has got to be THE BEST dispensary in Compton, the budtenders are so welcoming and the flower is amazing. I also remember seeing them on WEEDMAPS which is great!
They also have AMAZING deals everyday.
my fav is the stizzy deal, buy two get one free! Like whaaaat?!?!! Birthday cake , purple punch and skywalker are my go to stiiizy pods.
They even do 5g for $20 all the way up to 5g for $75.
This shop is a must if your trying to get a bang for your buck or trying to find real quality!< /Review>

I love Nugz with Attitude! The best dispensary near me and number 1 on weedmaps! They carry all my favorite products for vaping like madres vapes , golani , stiiizy carts , plug n play, just to name a few... You can get 10% off any vape on Thursday! I felt hooked up for sure! As for edibles, the best are the sourz edibles , galaxy edibles , stndrd gummies , gnarly cupcakes & they have more than that! Just ask the girls & they’ll show you their favorite! They always got something new. They got cheap weed, 20 caps , moonrock combo deals , all that. All the girls are friendly and offer the best customer service in Compton, hands down. They follow covid guidelines and always seem pleased to help you! Clean shop in general. Love it here. Bring a friend as a first time patient and you both will get a nice deal. They got prerolls for days and they offer a top shelf one for leaving a review. They’re the best in the city. Thanks again Jules for your help & knowledge! I'll definitely be back soon.</Review>

I’ve been coming here for 6 months now, I love the concentrate they offer. They have great prices and run 50% off house wax twice a week. The service is always fun and inviting and I always leave feeling super hooked up on their freebies. Try the gnarly cupcake, it’s so good you won’t even know it’s a edible 👏🏽👏🏽. If your lookin for quality cheap weed, this shop has a large collection in bud and they clean your weed of stems and never put shake in your jar!! The prices start as low as $15 for a eighth to some super fire at $60 eighth. They run great deals on bud like 9 gram quarter for ftp and referral! Ask your budtender how to make your sale a combo by adding moonrocks or sourz edibles for $5 or $10 bucks when you get any eighth. I swear this the best cannabis dispensary near me. I looked them up on weedmaps and their google maps account came up. When I saw they carried Stndrd carts and Stndrd gummies, I had to come check them out and I’m glad I did because now I come 3-5 times a week. I’m getting free top shelf prerolls just for letting you guys know how great they are. Definitely a good dispensary near me open from 8am- 12 midnight daily!!!< /Review>

Nugz with Attitude is the best shop in Compton and weedmaps!
They got fire on every shelf. Whatever you’re looking for! 20 caps, CBD, stndrd gummies, moonrocks and more. If you’re a first time patient or referring a friend, you’ll receive a 9gram quarter! Bomb deal! All the girls are sweet and genuinely interested in helping you find what’s best for your needs. Best customer service I’ve ever received at a cannabis dispensary. They follow Covid guidelines and the shop is very clean. They’re having Black Friday specials so I’m definitely coming back! Thanks Jules for all the help!</text>

Plus the staff I'd super dope, always having deals no matter what day you come thru. vibes are off too, love coming here for all my weed necessities, edibles selection is great..from drinks to tinctures to cookies..all kinds of goodies.

I Always come to nwa to see my favorite budtender maxi. She really takes her time and listens to what I really want. I can trust I’ll be satisfied with what maxi suggest. Nwa has the best quality in this neighborhood in Compton. The shop is always clean and everyone is friendly here. They follow COVID-19 stop the spread guild lines by always having gloves on and not letting guests in without mask. I get a 4 gram eighth anytime I come in with my student discount. And I leave high on a free dab of their house wax. Maxi always reminds me to get a half gram of crumble to add to my weed. It’s 50% off when you get a eighth. I told maxi they need to get their menu on weedmaps so we know what’s in shop before coming in. But ask for maxi for the best customer service and deals. All the girls are great here so I’ll definitely suggest coming to see what they have</text>

The cannabis products at this cannabis dispensary shop are amazing! The products are consistent, and I can honestly say I have never had a bad experience. The bud tenders are super knowledgeable and friendly. Their deals are amazing! Come check out this place you won’t be disappointed! Super sanitary and follows CDC guidelines. They started carrying PLUG N PLAYS too!</Text>

Best dispensary in Compton, max hooked me up with 20% off. She told me I can get the first time patient deal for 5 gram 8th on Wednesday. Check them on weed maps for the menu. The stiiizy are Bogota at 10 at the patient appreciation day. They also have great sourz gummies. Stndrd gummies are the best here<//text>

Love this dispensary, thanks weedmaps! Best in Compton for sure. When I came in I was politely greeted by everyone and I was pleased to see they follow COVID guidelines. I came to pick up a stiiizy birthday cake cart and got a bomb deal. Buy 2 get 1 free! I also found out they have my favorite stndrd edibles so I had to get some too. I love that they have 15 dollar eighths and great 20 dub deals. Thanks Jules for explaining the daily deals and when is best to come for what I need. You can find parking right in front or turn on cookacre, there’s parking there too. If you bring a first time patient with you, the both of you will get a 5gram 8th. I will definitely be coming back for their patient appreciation day on November 18th. Looking forward to it! Check them out, you won’t regret it.<//text>

I was referred by a friend and I couldn't be happier with my experience! As soon as I came in we were kindly welcomed by the girls and they explained the deal I got for my first time. The customer service at this shop in unmatched, especially in Compton. Everyone was wearing a mask and gloves. I got a nice deal on high quality bud, you can't beat that. They carry a wide variety of products from CBD to liquid edibles. I suggest everyone to check them out. You won't regret it!! My favorite cannabis dispensary off top!! I'll be back on the 5th of August for the party they are throwing. Shout out to the staff here they are amazing!!<//text>

<Text>Today was my first time at nwa and I got the ftp deal for 15% off my birthday cake stiiizy Pod. The budtender was kind and knowledgeable and told me I can get a 5 gram eighth tomorrow for their patients appreciation party. The shop was  clean and everyone was friendly there. My budtender hooked me up with a nice goodie bag for free and I got some fire sourz gummies to sample. They even have free dabs with $20 donations so I left super faded. I’ll definitely recommend this dispensary as the best in Compton. Thanks for the great product, service and price. I’m so glad I found you guys on Weedmaps 5/5 stars ⭐️<//Text><Rating>5< /Rating>< name>

< Review>
The best experience I’ve ever had at a cannabis dispensary here in Compton , and probably the best cannabis in the area of Compton 20 cap !!! This cannabis shop gave me the best costumer experience. The first  time patient deal is probably one of the best deals I’ve ever received . THEY ONLY CARRY TOP QUALITY PRODUCTS LIKE STIIIZY , PLUG IN PLAYS and many more !!!<//Review>

Came in today and was served by Blue who was super friendly and hooked it up with the daily deal which was a 6 gram special! I ended getting a gram of moonrock and ended up checking their 20 cap shelf and got the pennywise strain. Ill definitely refer friends and family to get my first time patient deal again!</Text>

<text>I came in to just pick up an eighth but after I smelled the Supreme OG I had to take buy the half. I haven’t seen this type quality bud in Compton anywhere else. I also purchased two of their sourz gummies & they gave me a free one! They also have some good 20cap deals. They got it all, I got hooked up with a really good deal so I walked out a happy man.< /text>< Name>

Great cannabis dispensary shop! They have a wide selection of cannabis strains, and delicious edible and vape products. I come here for the SOUR GUMMIES & STIIIZY PODS all the time! They never run out and bud tenders are super sweet. Highly recommend. They wear masks and gloves with hand sanitizer readily available. Thank you Nugz with attitude!</text>

<text>Best cannabis dispensary in Compton!!! They got my favorite cannabis juice, stndrd gummies & cool 20 caps when I’m looking for something good & quick. They always have stiiizy here b2g1, stiiizy birthday cake is the best. They have a party twice a month where they give a lot of freebies & 5g 8ths on Supreme OG. Best strain ever.
Check them out!!!< /text><user_id>101395086215664867721<//user_id><time>1597725809712</time>< pics>

<Name>Dam Her< /Name><text>max help me out over the phone by placing 7 grams of pennywise OG to the side for pick up. when i arrived, recep was very friendly and invited me to a smoke out on aug 19 with free snacks and edibles. When i got in the med room all the ladies made me feel welcome by greeting me all together. max told me i could bypass the line since i had a order on hold with her. i ask about vaping and she said stiiizy was the way to go. i told her i wanted to try it for work since i cant smoke blunts there and i heard vaping could help keep me high without any one knowing. she said vapes was know for its descret smell and instant high. she offer me a HYBRID call birthday Cake and i got 5 off my battery pack as a combo deal. ill definitely suggest checking this place out. if your tired of butender treating you like you need them then you need to come here and get the customer service you deserve when picking up weed!!!🙏🏽🧡 this shop also follow the guidelines to staying covid free😷< /text><resp>None< /resp></record>

They got good deals everyday and the new budtender Gio is super knowledgeable in CBD if you got question and will always give you the best weed in the shop when he helps you. The vibes is always good when you walk in, weed is fire always. great selection of vapes and edibles.

<review>I come to nwa all the time. The 710 concentrate available is the best and they have the best deals in Compton. i can pick up my cannabis juice and sourz edibles all at the same place also. They have a huge selection in edibles here with bulk and combo deals to drop the price. If you are a vaper then you have to ask them about the buy two get one free deal on stiiizy. I always ask for stiiizy birthday Cake, its my favorite strain and i suggest you try it out. Ask for maxi,  she hooks it up always!!!<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

< Review>
I come here all the time for just flower usually but Chyna had talked me into trying some fire  wax for the weed I had bought. What I really like what you can do is once you buy weed the price gets knocked down for the wax. This dispensary in compton never disappoints me ever they will make sure you will leave out of here with what you want. I can’t wait to see what’s up with the patient appreciation day coming up on the 16 they always got them poppin plus with the great deals. Go ahead and look at them on weed maps as well do you can see the amazing selection that they have from edibles to vapes they got it all!! Keep up the customer service ladies!! This was really the best 4/20 party ever thank you!!<//Review>

All these other compton shops might have good prices, but their weed is whack. I might have to spend a little more here, but at least i’m guaranteed the quality i’m paying for. BEST PRICES AROUND I PROMISE!</review>

< Review>
Nelly was super helpful on today’s choices and best Sunday deal for me and my family celebration! The last time I was here was 4/20 & had major fun and most importantly the deals I got before going out of town! It’s the best dispensary in Compton and realizing that comin in today! They have some good 5G $20 eights for beginner starters but the best is the $50 cap recommendation! I’m not goin anywhere else. My new home shop no matter where I travel</Review>

This the only shop that have $20 1/8ths caps on their flower. This the best shop I recommend to any family and friends in Compton.  Whatever I look for in flower, carts, and wax they always having a deal and best quality. A real hidden gem and the Budtenders always sweet and recommending the best deals . & Best $10 moonrock upgrade ! They have the best moonrocks and s/o to Nelly!< /Review>
