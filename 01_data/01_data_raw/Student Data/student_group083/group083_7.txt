Great group of mechanics. I drive from Placerville just to have them work on my car. Straight forward, trustworthy, affordable and they will not rip you off like most mechanics and dealerships. 5+ stars and a huge thank you to Chris and your team for always fixing my mess ups with my cars!<//text>

Nick was very helpful, knowledgeable, and from what I can tell, honest. He applied multiple discounts, went over the details and explained what was necessary and what could wait and applied no pressure.  Quality of work seems to be great and have had zero issues to date. Highly recommend!<//review>

<Text>My experience was very good. They were nice and professional. Very knowledgeable and straight forward about repairs and up front about estimates and prices after the fact. I knew what to expect. They were able to do same day service which was what I needed. It cost me a bit but they didn't over charge me. Brakes and rotor replacement ALWAYS cost you. They actually were able to tell me the back ones weren't good either, but one thing at a time. Overall I was happy with the service and will go back again.< /Text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>{'time': 1603118036885, 'text': 'Wow D. G. we love positive feedback!

<userid>115974562167729553449</userid><Text>Hello everyone who is reading this
I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!!
last week I gave them a call and some other places about my totoya sienna and I asked around for an estimate on how much it would be to replace my driver side A/C blend actuator and to replace 2 front motor mounts. I figured the problem on my own and wanted an estimate. On their billboards they advertise free estimates. When I was on the phone with an associate of midas she told me that she can't give me an estimate unless I come in. So I came into the store and talked to her she said that they need to run diagnostic of my car which will be 65$  the thing is I already told her what the problem was so they didn't need to run diagnostics all I was looking for is for her to give me an estimate. I really needed to get my ac fixed so I agreed to the diagnostic in hopes of them giving me a down to earth estimate. I then left the car with them and went home and was waiting for a call. I waited for 3 hours and called the store the same lady picked up and said they are gonna give me a call before 5 since that's when they close. I waited till 5:20 no calls from them i then called the store again and some dude picked up the phone and told me that he has my estimate and that the price is going to be 2,500$  that is ABSURD!! What kinda pricing is that. I then asked what would be the price for just the ac fix and they quoted me 360$ for the ac blend actuator and told me some bs of how its gonna take them 2.5 hours to do. So for the work of doing just the ac would be over 600$ I went on orielly online store found the same part for 165$ I ended up having to pay midas 65$ for basically killing my whole day waiting for my car and charging me for a "free estimate" I would not recommend this place.
This place is a money hungry scam machine!!

ps: I ended up fixing the problem myself took me no longer then 45 min to fix and total pricing was 165$< /Text><time>1604812448985< /time>< Name>

<rating>1< /rating><review>So I called Midas to get a quote for an oil change, I explained that I had a coupon from the Midas website. The manager said that because they were a franchise,  that  they do not honor that coupon. So I asked for a qutoe for an oil change, the manger said that it would be 59.99. I reluctantly agreed to that price and said i would be over shortly. When I got there the price jumped to 68 dollars. So I signed their document to have the work done and I went and sat down. About 20 min later a guy walked in with the same coupon that i had inquired about and the manager greeted  him; and accepted his coupon. After he told me that they don't honor that coupon. So I asked him why that guy got to use that coupon and I didn't. He said "Oh because he is getting a regular oil change". Before I could correct him, the lady at the desk told the manager that the coupon included the service I was getting. She said that they could honor it this one time. I grew up near a racist society, so I know what racism looks like. This was without a doubt one of the most blatant forms of racism I have seen. I will never go back there and make sure my family and friends don't go there either.< /review>< pics>

I had good experiences in the past but the last time I went there they estimated a job for me then when I went back to do it, they told that I didn't need to do what they had previously said. also, they claimed that the manager I had spoke to was not the manager anymore and had no notes about the previous visit. I felt like the person I talked to was being kind of rude and pushy about the repair so I decided to go somewhere else.</review>

< review>
Just moved to Sacramento from New York, not knowing anyone and with it being a Sunday I was worried I wouldn't be able to get my truck serviced. I found this shop open on a Sunday I called and spoke with Josh. He immediately got me into the shop ten minutes later. The whole staff was friendly and welcoming. They worked with me on the issues and walked me through in detail. Josh immediately called the noise in my drive train as a bad u joint. This place is amazing and the staff was knowledgeable and happy.<//review>

Thank you Midas. I really felt like they took the time to check out my car and keep me updated. I'm glad they caught some of the problems going on, and they showed me so I can understand.
I even got lots of advise on what to do to prevent future problems.<//Text>

I had my car towed to this Midas location due to the proximity from where my car had stalled out (alternator and battery died). The folks at the counter were helpful, polite and prompt. I received an estimate on the work fairly quickly but it was grossly overpriced at $1,300 versus calling around to other local shops and receiving quotes in the $700-800 range. The dealership quote was even less expensive,   which rarely happens. I called to notify the Midas that I would be having the work done elsewhere. The folks at the counter were also polite and helpful when I came to pick up my car and one of the technicians helped with a battery installation so the vehicle could be driven to the other shop. Overall, I'd say the people were very kind but I can't say anything about the work since I didn't opt to have the vehicle repaired at this location. If you have time, other places will likely be less expensive for the same or similar work.</Text>

My wife took my car in the first time and was told the ac diagnostic was going to cost 150$. I went in myself today after making an online appointment. Ac diagnostic was 60$ for me..... I had just replaced my ac blower motor, the resistor and 1 relay so I needed a pro diagnostic to tell me why my motor would not engage. They tell me it was my resistor and wanted to charge me 400$ to fix it. I Told them no thanks and I paid for my diagnostic and went on my way. I went right over to the auto parts store and I got a replacement for my resistor and replaced it in my car (bought a brand new one and installed in in 3 minutes). Ac still is still not working. When I was under the dash replacing the resistor I see that 2 wires from my new blower motor had been partially snipped.</text>

Took my car to Midas for an AC recharge.  These guys were great. Professional, helpful,  and despite not being able to affordably fix the final issue, I would still recommend David and the team at Midas.  They also offer rides locally if you're dropping your car off.  Awesome.</text>

< Review>
Took my car in for an oil change and to get my car door that wouldn’t open fixed. Took a total of five hours. Getting the door open was really really hard for them. They finally got it and took the door apart and realized the part they needed they don’t manufacture anymore so they were gonna have to get it specially ordered for $317 and with all the labor involved it was gonna be about $500. The guy there, Josh, was able to work some magic with some spare springs in the garage and saved me from having to get that special $317 part. He also didn’t charge me the extra hour of manual labor they had to work. Overall very pleased.<//Review>

The bartender, Brandi, was friendly and attentive and doing an excellent job of giving great personalized service to each group of people in her area. She talked up your breakfast service where her daughter works so well that I considered getting up early and going down to check that out, but ultimately decided to stay in my ultra comfy, warm, cozy bed as long as possible instead. Not only will I be returning (again, this was my second stay), but I've recommended this location to my company for when our out of town associates visit. Thanks again for another great stay.< /review></record></dataset><record>

If you want your car to have the least amount of care and respect take it here. I brought my cars here for an oil change and tire rotation twice. Both times, I marked my tires and they did NOT rotate them and lied to my face. I did not get what I paid for. They also spilled oil on the engine of one of my cars. I will be filing a complaint.<//review>

<review>My daughter completely wore down her brakes. I had her bring it to Midas. She didn't know anything about cars or brakes, but after her visit with Midas she has a better understanding about brakes. Turns out her calipers were bad, so it wasn't completely her fault. Midas not only took her home so she didn't have to wait around, but they explained everything to her and showed her what was going on in her car. It's feels great knowing my daughter will be in good hands. Thank you.< /review><pics>None<//pics>< GmapID>

Moved to West Sacramento a few months ago. During my move I noticed a noise from my car, so I stopped by this Midas. The older gentleman from the office went with me on a drive to hear the noise. He was very informative and even had my car lifted so he can show me what was going on. Got my vehicle repaired shortly after. Found my auto repair and oil change spot in West Sacramento. Thank you.< /text>

<Review>I went into  Midas on October 12, 2018 for my oil change appointment with  a 19.99 coupon that was issued to me by Midas and had expired September 30, 2018. I spoke with the manager and explained I had had surgery and was only just now able to be up and around to get things done and would he honor the coupon that was issued to me as a courtesy. He said no. He said the best he could do was 29.99. He said if he accepted the coupon he would be loosing money, I told him I didn't understand how if it was issued and sent to my address in the first place. I signed the paperwork and waited over an hour for the oil change to be completed. I then noticed my car in the parking lot and figured they would be calling me soon but after waiting a while I went to the counter and asked if they had my paperwork because my car had been sitting out front he said no and went to look for it. I completed my transaction and went to my car and there was no return reminder sticker. I went back in into the store and asked about it and this is when he filled one out. Disappointed in them for the first time.</Review>< pictures>

Have used this company for many years. From silverfish, to bees and every other pest, they always have in depth knowledge and a plan. After 100's of calls, they always do the job right. Great family run business. Highly recommended!<//Review>

I spent time researching to find this family owned, local long time company that stands behind their services. Three generations giving extraordinary service and a better value than the other guys. I love Pinpoint and the three brothers who all interact with us. They are generous with their time and they offered a volume discount after I added a second property. I’ve been a customer four years and I can say it’s good when your exterminator drops everything to put you first! ❤️</Text>

I really like this company. I had an ant infestation and they were really quick to schedule a visit and came back as needed to ensure the problem was resolved. I signed up for the routine maintenance and haven't had any unwanted guests since. The quality for the price and especially the use of non-toxic products were key factors in choosing this family owned company. Highly recommend!!!</Review>

<Text>Best Pest Control Company in San Diego. After extensive research on finding a company to rodent proof my house, i discovered that Josh is the well-known and respected expert in the field. He works for Pinpoint. This company is experienced and professional. If you have rats or mice in your house or attic, look no further. This is your company.< /Text><Date>1578627527642< /Date>< UserId.>

<Text>As a real estate professional, I am often asked for recommendations from clients for pest issues and I have told them about Pinpoint Pest Control even though I had not personally used them.  I had heard from others about how satisfied they were with the service they had received from Pinpoint.  And then we experienced our own troubles with a rodent invasion.  Pinpoint quickly responded and did a lot more than just setting traps.  Josh located several areas around our home that allowed access for these critters and sealed them up so that we don't have future intrusions. I will happily recommend Pinpoint in the future to my clients & friends because of my personal experience with this fine company.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None</response><GmapID>0x80dc0c3fc4ecc413:0x1d546bfad457535< /GmapID></record>

<Text>Pinpoint has been a valued benefit to living in coastal North County San Diego.  Pests of all types used to make their home at our home - NO MORE! The team at Pinpoint has us on a schedule that keeps the spiders and ants and other creepy crawlers at bay! We are ever grateful and truly appreciate the respect they show our animals and our privacy. Thank you Steve, Chacie and the team at Pinpoint.

We really appreciate the service you guys have been providing us at our two properties.

We especially appreciate your help in addressing the mice problem at one of those properties.  Your technician Josh went above and beyond to help us close any gaps that mice could possibly enter the property through.<//text>

<text>I use them for routine bug control. Great service and very friendly staff. They are attentive and always ask if there are any areas that may need extra attention. Family owned businesses so you get a more personal service. If I ever have a concern it is addressed immediately without question. That type of service does not exist much anymore. I would highly recommend Pinpoint Pest.<//text>< pics>

Pinpoint has kept my home pest-free (while neighbors have been dealing with ants, centipedes, etc) for over 10 years. They’re efficient, courteous and very effective. Their products are very safe and they will always advise if there are any issues (which have always been minor). I love them!<//text>

We had a MAJOR ant problem for many years, but don't like to use chemicals. I tried every natural remedy under the sun and finally couldn't take it anymore. I have asthma, so I was worried about the chemicals. Pinpoint came and within 3 days, not one solitary ant to be found inside or out and NO asthma problem. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this company!!! They are also very professional and speak good English to explain exactly what they are doing. Very important.< /review>

<Review>Started off great at original house, then we moved and every  preference got wiped away, like we never spoke before.  Technician showed up  unannounced (We have dogs), walked around a little and left. Never moved rugs and  no spray marks. Who ever was home never saw anyone spray or wipe spider webs from the eves.

But pinpoint always defended there company and kept taking our money with little to no service.< /Review>< gmap_id>

Pinpoint does a great job and always shows up. They conveniently leave the bill in the door when they finish spraying. We barely see them  but know they have been here because there's no more spiders, ants or other bugs. If they return,  bugs, Pinpoint will send someone out immediately to spray again AND more importantly, it is safe for our dog Sadie!</review>

Pinpoint Pest Control has been providing us with excellent pest control for well over 5 years. After having previous pest control service people come in hazmat suits, we were concerned about the toxicity of the chemicals being used, so discontinued services. After having ant invasions in our home, we investigated pest control services again and were thrilled to have Pinpoint provide pest control without the toxic chemicals and hazmat suits. We have had no pest problems since they took over our pest control. Our dog is not exposed to toxic chemicals while out in the yard nor are we. Their service people are excellent, friendly, and provide excellent customer service.< /Review>

The food was just OK. Sambar was the only thing that was decent. Didn't like any other stuff. Had ordered bonda, vada, rice plate, paratha with chole. Ambience is nice with old Hindi music and posters and photos. But nothing special with the food taste. I would not visit the place again !< /Review>

It's a compact place. Indian but South Indian like stuff more in thali or combo style. It was difficult to get the attention of the servers possibly because it was busy, but still. Had been here over earlier and had liked it marginally more then.< /text>

< Review>
I visited Parus after 15 years. Still savoring the old memories. Very disappointed. Food quality had certainly changed. Greasy, and unpredictable.
Service was prompt and quick but the Gentleman with a Pony Tail clearly did not prefer dealing with people of Indian descent.
Very snobby and unapologetic. Perception is reality. No worries, may be he had a bad day.

Overall utterly disappointed.<//Review>

Very friendly and helpful staff. Decor is one of a kind. (It may even make the food taste oh so good) If you don't know what to order and you are in a group of 4+, order the "family" style. The kitchen will proceed to serve a variety delicious dishes. Different every time too. The water cups are awesome. If you know what I'm talking about, you've been here. Don't let the scary restaurant front trick you. It's worth a visit.</Review>

<review>Staff and service was good at Paru's but food wasnt great, they had very few options and most of them were very similar. Food was served hot though. You can visit this place if you crave for Indian food, need good ambience but not worry as much about the rest. Overall the experience was not bad.</review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Looks a little suspect with its locked gate and buzzer from the outside but once inside it's another world. We always love our waiter suggestions.

Don't just a book by its cover, this shady entrance will unlock the best Indian food you have yet to experience.Truly a unique Indian food experience. The ambience is unbelievable; feels intimate and makes a great date here. The food is southern Indian so it specialize in doses and the owner will hook you up and give you a taste of everything if you just trust him.< /Review>

<Date>1524374641576</Date><Name>Uthra kt</Name><rating>2< /rating><text>Definitely not the right place for spicy and flavourful food. It would be an under statement if I say everything was very mild and bland. There is a lot of scope for improvement and on top of all they have to get the basics right for all the items. It is definitely not authentic Indian food as it was.devoid of all the Indian components. I felt it's more customized towards favouring  the crowd here. People having authentic indian food standards as bench mark would find this place highly disappointing.< /text><Response>None</Response>< Pics>

<text>Located on Sunset Blvd, Paru's looks a bit shady on the outside, but the real beauty lies when you go inside. The restaurant is a great, laid-back place, with a casual, cool exterior and an interior with sofa seats. It is definitely pricey although for the quality of the food, you can say that it's worth it.< /text><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2bf55b42ea2ef:0x9e3b3d0b533ea3c4< /Gmap_id><user_name>Nimalen Sivapalan< /user_name>< time>

The food here is completely amazing. The security gate at the entrance might confuse you (first time I went there I thought I was in the wrong place) but don't let it throw you off.

This place specializes is south Indian cuisine. Expect the menu to be different from most Indian restaurants in the US. Don't be afraid to try something completely new!</text>

The food was so authentic just like a home cooked Indian meal. It's a very small place with a very trance-like ambience. Don't be deceived by the entrance which looks a little shady. It is actually a nice place with very good food at reasonable prices.

P.s: To all the people who said that it's not authentic because it's not spicy - Indian food is not always spicy! Especially South Indian food is not too spicy and is very healthy.</Text><pics>None<//pics><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x80c2bf55b42ea2ef:0x9e3b3d0b533ea3c4< /gmap_id></record>

<Text>My rating is for the service rather than the food. There was a moderately aged caucasian server in the restaurant who discriminated us (Indians) from beginning till end. He took orders from all the people who came after us and didn't take order from us until everyone else was done. He even made comments about our food choices and vexingly served us (he was the only server). I would not recommend this place if you want a good service. The food is quite good though.< /Text><resp>None< /resp><userid>116864408670932699685</userid></record></dataset><record>

Don’t bother. Mediocre food that basically has no taste. Frozen Indian food tastes better at tenth of the price. Waste of money and time.< /Review>

Not suitable for Indian taste buds that expect the flavors of Indian spices. All the food here is bland and un-flavorful. Their spiciest chutney is sweet. My Indian taste buds were utterly disappointed. We came back here for a dinner after a long day and were left so so disappointed. I will never come back here. I'd give a half star if I could. Nice folks but sorry the food isn't close to good.</review>

Excellent place for authentic south Indian food, nice staff, a bit confusing entrance, athnic interiors, on the main street, at walking distance from several hotels. Accepts Debit and Credit cards. Good place to bring family. Visible from road in traffic. Offers coffee, take away services.</review>

Loved the ambiance! It gives the the typical South Indian feel. I had been craving for a good South Indian meal since long, and this place was the perfect to satisfy my craving. I had ordered the South Indian platter which had a little bit of everything in it. The masala dosa was the best of the lot. It’s a sure to go place if you want to have good South Indian food.</review>

We went to this restaurant after visiting Griffith observatory back in 2015. Tried the south indian food option and it was really good. The dosa and curries were simple in taste and not spicy. I liked their tea and ambience was colorful.</Review>

<rate>2<//rate><Text>Only place I could find open at around 10:30pm serving Indian food in this area. The food here is good, but what put me off was that the staff/manager here wasn't very friendly nor professional. He wouldn't even serve us (even after asking them to) water until we ordered our food. Also, he seemed to have an attitude of doing us a favor by serving us food at that time even though their working hours are till 11. Calling it an Indian restaurant they should at least follow the traditions of serving water to guests and treating them well. To be honest, they should be ashamed.< /Text>< pics>

<Response>None< /Response><text>I usually don’t write reviews though I am not happy with the stuff. But, I felt like I should write a review so that people can stay away from this restaurant.  I felt like this restaurant does not have a real cook as none of the food item even closer to the real one.  Here’s my experience with some of the food items that I ordered:

1. vegetable pulao and it’s just a plain rice with peas toppings
2. Parata with chickpeas.  Chickpeas just soaked and there is not even bit of tomato and onion.
3. Pongal - it’s not even cooked properly.

I did not take snapshots of the food since I already thrown them out. My humble request is just stay away from this restaurant and choose something else otherwise you would regret.<//text><UserId.>104050993849115244666</UserId.>< gmapID>

I love this place. It's my favorite. I see unfavorable comments about the food and location. This is not the same Indian food that is more popularly seen these days. There are many regions of India providing variety to the cooking styles. Too many people know this place already. It's a favorite for many.<//text>

The Ultimate south Indian cuisine I had ever been to ever in the US. You  should never ignore this place, my mouth is watering as am recollecting what more to write. Being a typical south Indian, i would open-heatedly say, none other restaurant had reproduced the authentic taste as Paru's kitchen has. Nice ambiance and, TASTE BEATS THE PRICE!!!</Text>

Expensive??? Maybe if you are used to eating at McDonalds...  I haven't found a cheaper place with better good anywhere in LA. My boyfriend and I had a full dinner, plus appetizers and wine fir under $20 and left stuffed. This place is great. Looks dodgy from the outside, but is wonderful inside, the food is delicious, and the service is great.</Review>

This was the first south Indian food I've tried outside of my partner's parents home. It's definitely not as good as parents home, but it's good.

The first thing I noticed was the beautiful garden and space inside the black gates on sunset blvd. what a contrast once you go in!the waiter even allowed us to safely store our bikes in a corner of the outdoor garden/table area while we ate.

The service was excellent, there was many vegan and vegetarian options, and the dish styles and portions are shareable. South Indian food is mostly water-based and lighter than northern Indian food. I was happy to find a spot that even my partner whose south asian approves. I've gone twice and I'll definitely go again.</text>

Please stay clear of this place, unless you're either super high or just have $100 lying around. The cook just throws some turmeric in some boiling water and calls it "rasam". He adds a little tamarind juice into the same mix and calls it "sambhar". We tried almost all items on the menu and we had to go eat at a nearby McDonald's to cleanse ourselves and bring back our appetite. Save yourself from this trash.< /text>

<text>After being buzzed inside, you find yourself in a very spacious patio with very cute lighting.  The patio is a nice place to sit when it's warm outside.

<Review>Well, extremely disappointed! To be honest, we were super hungry and dint want to waste the food! So we ate all of em. Poorly presented food, it was smelly( old oil maybe). Here's the worst part we even have to tip them. We are visitors for Australia. We don't have this tip culture there! But just to bring the food that we ordered and serve water 15% tip ?! Not fair. This tip thing is not specific to this restaurant. One of the staff was really creepy, he kept looking at us and kept asking if he can take the plates. Complete disappointment and waste of $35 including tip! Btw, we ordered for the tanjore double  don't ever order that !</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Gmap_id>

Reading mixed reviews I was a bit skeptical but Went last night and I loved it here...Its a nice cozy place with Indian Cultural Decor..Food was good and not very spicy..Best part of food was it gave that feeling of homecooked meal..I had samosas with chole (served with coconut and tamarind chutney)and that was tasty as well as nice crispy and soft to eat , They reminded me of my mom's samosas.. Loved them..
Also we asked them for no onion no garlic food (Jain Food) they had Tomatoe uttapam (with cilantro and coconut chutney) as an option..and it was tasty as well... Pineapple juice was fresh and nice.. Price is cheap and quantity was good...Staff was friendly and they catered exactly as we asked..Will visit again when in LA..👍🏼<//text>

<review>We visited Parus after a gap of almost 6 years and in that time the quality of food has deteriorated significantly . We ordered both South Indian and North Indian items and sad to say that neither was palatable . The dosa had portions of uncooked batter , the Parathas were large but had places where th dough hadn’t been properly cooked . I’m a home cook and know a good meal from a substandard one . This place is not what it used to be .< /review>< Pictures>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>Me, I'm a devoted patron of Paru's, I would eat there every week (and I have) but I travel a lot and sadly can't. Besides, the staff might think I was a foodie-stalker (which I'm not.) That said if every city that I frequent had a wonderful vegetarian option as supremely delectable, consistently tasty and reasonably-priced as Paru's then I would suspect I had literally died and gone to a heaven-like realm. My advice for first-timers: when they bring out the menu don't waste a moment, go with the Tanjore Double. It's divine. Next visit try something new but your third visit believe me you'll return to the the Tanjore Double.< /Text>< pics>

< Review>
Went there with three kids aged 3, 6 and 9. Staff was very kind and helped us out to figure out what to order for them boys (ended up eating samossas and puris). The waiter was very kind and the food was very tasty and different from what we Occidentals usually get in Indian restaurants. I would definitely recommend this place to curious people.< /Review>

We visited Paru's on the 29th of December. We were five of us, and quite honestly, our experience wasn't memorable at all. The ambience of the place is really good, with a nice authentic Indian feel to it.. However, we experienced poor service and low food quality. We had to wait quite a while to even get someone to take our order. Additionally, even after we get our Indian thalis, we had to wait quite a while to get a plate of purees and papad we were supposed to get with the food, inspite of reminding them multiple times. Furthermore, the food quality is poor, and the quantity too is very very little, and doesn't justify the price of the food at all. We came with really high hopes, but ended up leaving disappointed.
Definitely worth visiting if you want to get a feel of the Indian vibe in LA, but your taste buds won't be satisfied at all.< /Text>

It looked a little shady that we had to ring the door bell first but when we got in, it was a pretty decent place. I ordered masala dosa and idli which were great. Just like home food. Fresh batter used for both (I can tell). And ended with a madras coffee which was the very madras coffee! The chickpea salad was OK which my husband ordered. Good place to dine.

As mentioned by many, this place is overrated. No where close to authentic south Indian. The mango lassi was sour. Poori was flat. Papad came after we almost finished main course. Won't go again.< /Text>

Ordered a masala dosa which was half the size of any normal masala dosa elsewhere. The sambhar was extremely watery n the quantity was pathetic. Also ordered Paratha with chole n again the quantity of chole was ridiculously tiny. Teeny tiny bowl which would not suffice even for 1/4 of the dry paratha. So ordered the chole again for $4 with the same teeny quantity.
So overall the experience was not good at all. I think they should be ashamed of serving such a teeny amount of sambhar n chole.
Ambience was good. Service was fine too.< /Text>

<Text>I have mixed reviews about this place, first time I visited me and my wife were so happy to find a place which sells authentic South Indian food in this area. We loved there dosa, idli and wada. We raved about this place to all our friends.
Second visit is something we would like to forget, we went all out, ordered there meals combo which included all South Indian dishes like Dosa, Idli, Rice, Poori, Saag, etc. Expect for Dosa which was heavenly everything else seemed liked it was from some other crappy restaurant made in a hurry. Idli literally was half its size and deformed, wada was like a sponge of oil, where as rice, poori and other curries were the worst I ever had. Recommendation- Stay away from there meal special and stick to Dosa<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x80c2bf55b42ea2ef:0x9e3b3d0b533ea3c4<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Chutneys were taste less and they will charge for extra, definetely we need xtra because of their chutney, sambar quantity. The sambar was like just yellow soup with out any vegetables. Actually none of the items had onion , tomato, vegetables. They just used peas every where. I dont know whether it was just on saturday evenings.finally and totally it was a disappointing experience</review>< Pictures>

<Text>I'm giving 2 stars just because the service was decent. But the FOOD wasn't. At all. Everything tasted like nothing. Never thought indian food could be so bland. It seemed like an indian restaurant for people who never tried decent indian food. I'm not sure if Paru's don't want or don't know how to cook edible indian food. Till they figure it out, you and your intenstine should stay away.<//Text>< pictures>

<Text>Loved the dosa and upma.. We were craving for some simple South Indian food with very less masala.
We had been traveling for one week and were tired of eating extremely creamy and rich North Indian dishes.
Felt heavenly when we had their dosas.. And we even packed some Idlis for our Breakfast next day😊</Text><date>1459613897774< /date><user_name>Namritha Nandakumar Shenoy</user_name><user_id>114976383293930710861< /user_id>< Rate>

<review>Was at Paru's  on Saturday Night March 12 2016 . We were craving for home style south indian food. Simple and totally like roz ka khanna. Only a pure south india will appreciate the authenticity of their food. Next time in LA without a kitchen in my hotel, I will drive 40 mins to eat their everything. Real south Indian food is very hard to find.

So for all non south indians....this is the place to eat the real home style South Indian.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Our family visited Paru, Sunset Blvd in July 2015.  The experience was disappointing, the food being of no taste.  We were five family members and none had any good opinion about the food.  It was totally disapplointing having gone there with high expectations.< /review>

I went with my family during my visit to LA to this place. The outside appearance of the restaurant was misleading.But once we got in, we found the ambience to be up scale,though too cramped. we ordered for an assorted dinner Ala carte.There was idli,sambar,chutney,rava upma,dosa and vada.i will rate each of the item seperately:
idli- horrible .it was not cooked at all and the shape was bad.did not taste like idli
vada- was hard and oily.probably the batter was old and hence it was hard.
rava upma - was in edible form.better than other items on plate
dosa- again uncooked on one side
chutney- was dead cold.
sambhar - was the saviour of the day. with the help of sambhar i could finish the meal.

well after a very disppointed dinner, we called the manager and gave him the feedback. Guess he was good to us because we too were indians and hence did not charge us the full amount and chopped the bill to 50 %.As a compliment he also gave us a sweet dish and said the cook inside was a mexican and hence he had to be trained more on indian cooking.
He mentioned this place was frequented by americans than indians.Hence he dosent get frequent feedbacks on the quality of food.
verdict- This dosent qualify for the list of good indian restaurants in LA. I still dont know why many reviews say so many good things about this place.This wasnt authentic indian food if you are looking for one.< /Review>

I'm not a vegetarian but after getting the food they recommended, I forgot there wasn't any meat! Also the serving sizes are massive so you'll be fine with just two entrees and you might still have leftovers.< /Review>

The is my favorite taco shop. I've been going here for years. The staff is always friendly, and the food has never disappointed me. They pay attention to your order, unlike some other local shops which disregard if you ask to leave an ingredient off (in my case, onions). Everything tastes super fresh. I can not recommend them highly enough.  My favorite items are the surf and turf California burrito and the big rolled tacos.< /text>

I have been going to the El Cajon location ever since it opened, but now the lakeside location is closer for me. Either way, the food is phenomenal! Their carne asada is so tender and well seasoned, and my favorite burrito is the lakeside burrito! Anything on the menu is worth a try though!<//review>

<Review>I got a Cali Burrito. It was hot and was ready about a minute after I paid for my order. It tasted like grease and was nearly flavorless, even the pico inside the burrito had no flavor. I'm only giving one extra star because it was a decent sized burrito, but they won't get more business from me - I got a really bad impression from that one visit. They talk trash about their customers.< /Review>< GmapID>

< review>
Uh, no.⁠
⁠
Caveat: I generally dislike what some people call taquitos, others call flautas, and what San Diego calls "rolled tacos," which (in San Diego County) are typically cylindrical taco dorados smothered in old guacamole and shredded yellow cheese.
⁠
So you can guess how I feel about the much-heralded "Big Rolled Tacos with Shredded Beef" served at Albert's Fresh Mexican Food. I've been told by people who eat this miserable kind of thing that Albert's make the "best" version of this in San Diego, but I just wasn't feelin' it. The shredded beef was dry and tasted like it came out of a tin, the tortilla had the taste of metallic residue, and the guacamole had a pasty texture despite being palatable.⁠ The frying oil needs to be changed more frequently too, as I'm sure the slightly fishy flavor it imparts is not intentional.

I also tried the (non-big) "Rolled Tacos with Ground Beef," and preferred them slightly, as the meat wasn't as dry and lifeless.
⁠
The operation is clean, the people working here are friendly, and the salsa roja is pretty good, which is why Albert's earns three stars, slightly boosted by pandemic sympathy.

Don't worry, Albert's: it's not you, it's me. El Tianguis, La Barbacoa Autentica de Borrego, Tuétano Taqueria, and Los Cuatro Milpas make the only rolled tacos/flautas/taquitos in SD that I have deemed fit for human consumption. You're not any worse than all of the rest.⁠<//review>

<text>Ordered carne asada fries and asked for adobada on top she charged me an extra 7 dollars because of that. So it came out to 19.21. I've ordered this before and it's only come out to 11 dollars and some change. They're excuse was that its expensive for adobada which I highly doubt or else every adobada place would be out of business if it cost 7$ to 1/4 of a pound of meat into the fires. Order them regular and you'll be happy if your looking for campechana fries don't come here .<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

Great food with so many choices of dish combos its unbelievable. The cashiers were super friendly and the food came out in a timely manner. Salsa was well balance with flavor and spiciness and the complimentary chips and salsa held us down until our food came out. Try it out!< /Review>

<Review>I started coming here because it was close.  Found the food is good.  Love the complimentary chips and carrots but only if you dine in.  The worker bees are your usual, "wish I was some place else" no smile or greeting types.  Tv in the corner is nice.  Place is spotless.  Outside seating is a plus.  Prices are in the normal 8 to 10 range.  Taco Tuesday is honored but have to ask for it otherwise they will charge the normal price.

Covid 19 has changed everything, especially food places.  No longer can I dine in and get the complimentary chips and carrots.  I asked for them the other night but was told since the order was to go I would have to pay for them.  All I want is a handfull of chips and three carrot slices but no.  Ok I understand.  But all the orders are to go now.  I will go back when I can dine in but for now no carrots equals no customer.  Typical penny wise pound foolish mentality.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<rate>5< /rate><text>Albert's is our favorite taco shop in the La Mesa area.  They have healthy choices, their protein bowls with rice, black beans, avocado, etc are flavorful and enough for two"regular sized girl" meals. They have lettuce wraps tacos, they are delicious! The grilled fish tacos are fresh, the veggies are always fresh and I love the flavors of the food, not overwhelming. The salsa bar is small but made in house and always fresh and the restaurant is always very clean when we're there.

First time at this location. Great same experience as the Lakeside one. They messed up my order and as soon as we figured it out they quickly fixed it and gave my money back for charging me twice. They handled it all so quickly and easily, I love that. Will definitely be back for the great service and great food!<//text>

<Time>1569965118057<//Time><rating>3< /rating><text>Pretty much standard Mexican fare. Not the best I've had, but certainly not the worst. I ordered a cali surf & turf burrito. It was good and had a lot of shrimp, but it was lacking carne asada. The chipotle cream sauce sounded really good but was a bit bland. The free chips and salsa were also just average. Was the burrito and a drink worth $12.48? I don't think so, but it was just good enough that I may give it another shot next time I'm around. ⅗ stars< /text>< pics>

<Review>If you want fast relative good Mexican food Albert's is pretty decent. Check your go order. You might have someone else's. The staff is too busy talking to really pay attention. Their cleanliness isn't the best. ALBERT IS THE WORST.  Back and forth to his truck with time cards, change and then serving food. No one washes their hands. Wipe off your own tables.< /Review>< pictures>

< Review>
I was pretty excited to try this food based on reviews, location and pictures. I thought I had found a gem near my new place, unfortunately, my experience was horrible. Not only was my food cold and had a weird smell it seemed as thought the cooks were in a hurry  and did not heated my food. The carne asada meat had fajita seasoning to disguise how old it was. It that was the only problem I would just left it at that, and not go back. However, today i woke up with severe stomach ache, due to food poisoning.  It's a shame but that was my experience at this place.</Review>

It's ok. Pretty typical fare. If you are in this shopping center and need a quick taco fix it will do, but I would not seek it out otherwise.< /text>

< review>
Burritos are too mushy; that shows that 'Alberts' is making too much PROFIT, by lacking the correct ingredients.  The feeling/filling of classified high-end burrito HERE  --- is much the same filling/feeling as a tortilla wrapped with rice & beans inside.
That light-weight. That filling.
I never compared the prices of the two above, yet.

maybe, now $$prices to rice & beans may elevate.<//review>

Their food is excellent, better than any other Mexican taco shop in this area. There is only one thing, their phone service is not as excellent as their food. I have called a few times to ordered food, and, was put on hold for a long period of time, and then, hang up. I hope they hire more help soon, I would hate to stop eating their delish food</Text>

As one reviewer put it "biggest rolled tacos ever!" and they are correct, and they taste great. This looks like a typical taco shop but don't pass this place by. Their menu has combo burritos not found elsewhere and they do a GREAT job on the standards such as the CA burrito, and anything with carne asada in it, (sorry I haven't tried the chicken plates but my friend says they're great). The staff is friendly and helpful, the shop is open late for La Mesa standards, and the food is damn good. What else do you want?<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

This is my favorite "Taco shop" in La Mesa. My kids and I go here about once a week. I haven't had a bad experience with service or food. My favorite thing is a Monarch burrito but everything is great.< /Review>

< Review>
Clean restaurant, very friendly staff and most important, excellent mexican food.  They offer all expected mexican fare however in addition, they offer large rolled tacos and a number of unique burritos.  Try the new Monarch it is delicious.  If you dine in, expect a basket of muti-colored chips with excellent red and green sauce.  Truly, my new favorite local mexican fare.< /Review>

The portions here are huge! Large selection of tacos (including calamari tacos), burritos,etc but not too much seafood unfortunately. (Only seafood item is a ceviche tostada) decent selection of Mexican and domestic beers.<//review>

I had their pollo asado burrito. It was under five bucks and was huge. They have an aguas frescas self-serve fountain along with the usual sodas. The staff is great. Very clean. As it is very popular with locals there times when it is crowded.< /Review>

In fact, Alberts is our first stop as soon as we get off the plane! The food is incredible and the staff are always very friendly. Thank you for offering a pleasurable dining experience every time.<//text>< Pics>

Great park. Large equipmentneith swings and multiple slides. A smaller kid section though it's a little sparse. Lots of concrete picnic benches. Large amount of green space with some medium sized trees. Shade is common but lacking on the equipment. 1 tennis court and 2 basketball courts, and a baseball backstop.

Beautiful park for all sorts of team sports, young kids, and families. Picnics a must.

Biggest downside is lack of a public restroom.</text>

Great park for toddlers and older kids. You can also bring dogs here as there is a huge open field for them and to play sports.   There are tennis courts and basketball courts.  Only downside is no restroom.<//text>

It needs more actives like a water bucket park I know the city has money to do so. The toddler section is to plan the children rather play with the rubber tire shredding on the ground than the games< /review>

Simply, "mauvelous!"
The only place to shop for clothing; both adults and children.
Also, quality type toys for age groups 1 thru 8 years old! At decent prices.
Not the top $$$/USD, that you see at 7-11 stores, and "Big-5 prices" ($$$ USD).
Monday, 1/20/20, prices are knocked off 50% at the SAVERs store in Lomita !!! Fifty percent !!!!
When did you ever See Big-5 or 7-11 and other retailers, have "that kind" of a bargain? Not in your lifetime, or mine.
So, hop to it on Monday, January twentieth...and bring plenty of greenbacks-$$$$$$$$$$.</text>

<Text>This location has always been bad, they don’t treat their customers with respect. Prices are too high and their work ethics are terrible. If you’re planning on tinting your windows here, DO NOT COME! These guys don’t care about you or your car, all they care about is your money. Stay way from this shop and go look for another one!<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80c2912b8f05066b:0xc463d8d77dbe01db</GmapID></record>

<time>1590281385497</time><Rate>1< /Rate><Text>Real bad customer service an appointment is needed apparently but honestly I don't see what the point of an appointment is if when you get there on time for your appointment and you still have to wait over 30 mins to get your car worked on. I had a 3pm appointment but had to wait 45 extra minutes for them to get to my car. I was told that I couldn't wait at their storefront for my car I had a face mask on so I'm sure it wasn't because of that although there were like 3 people waiting for their cars and one customer  was walking around their work area so not sure why they told me I couldn't wait for my car right outside especially after waiting almost an hour for them to get to my car. Tint came out nice though so if you don't value good customer service and just want to get your windows tinted I would say this place is for you. Probably won't be coming back unless there's a problem with my tint.<//Text>< Pictures>

<Text>Okay, I give these guys five stars because they are super cool and they have lots of stuff. Their prices are very reasonable but they do the cheapest crappiest swap meet hack job type of work. I should take a picture. It does not look like a professional installed it because well I think they're hiring the homeless here. Anyways it worked for now</Text>< Response>

< Review>
Did the bait and switch and was charged another 100.00. Alarm was installed in the wrong location with relays just laying everywhere and wires out in the open. Alarm could of been defeated easily in a second. They wrapped a bunch of wires in a roll of electrical tape and now I know why. I took the tape off and what a big mess! Wires wrapped around other wires. A hot wire with 4 other wires tied into it in 4 different spots. A bright YELLOW wire for the horn drooping along the outside of the kickpad out in the open.   Used a cheap bypass not a quality one.  Looks like 3 different people worked on it. One neat job with a fine solder and tape job then a terrible tape job already unraveling (week old) then some squeeze connectors on some other wires. I ended up fixing and cleaning up the wires. Adding wire to tie up in one location and moving all the wires out of reach. Bolting down the relay so they don't rattle around. No longer looks like a mess of wires going every which way but neat and organized and hard to disable. 689.00 hit to the wallet had it overnight and took me a few days to make it right< /Review>

<Review>Tint wasn't done right wouldn't stick to metrix on window and they didn't know why???? And my stereo they put in already is making a funny sound like it is shorting out or the ground is touching something oh and my speaker blew in the back seat. I guess 900 hundred dollars was to cheap for a good job. Thanks.<//Review>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
I would go back, They were able to do my nails quickly and well! My biggest complaint was the color didn't match the sample I picked out, however I still like it! Next time I'll try and communicate more clearly.  However it gets a little crowded, if you haven't been vaccinated, try and go on a weekday when they'll be empty!</Review>

<Review>Well, I wanted to give this place a try, bad bad service, they didn’t like that I wanted regular nail polish for my Pedi, even tho I got the  paraffin wax, they got upset  and didn’t even care to show me when I can dry the color, the girl who did my toes and nails was laughing all the time in a silly way  that was very disrespectful and annoying , waist of time and money,< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMHyBjk6akszbrCfRNfcdXB0bz2ZN9XTAAlw01T=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80c3263208b191e5:0x1c1de1f91ce3a73a<//gmap_id></record>

I asked my friends to be my bridesmaids at this place. They were very friendly and they did an awesome job. They gave us complementary apple cider in champagne glasses. Overall everybody had a good time.<//review>

<Text>This place is amazing.

I am a heterosexual male and LOVE getting my nails cleaned up.  Prices are great, service is fantastic and ambiance is nice. Highly recommended!<//Text><pics>None</pics><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80c3263208b191e5:0x1c1de1f91ce3a73a< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>
<rating>1< /rating><Text>The place looks modern and comfy but they nickel and dime you for everything. Not worth the wait; dry greeting at the door, the lady I had was slow and meticulous which is great when the shop is empty or you have no appointments waiting... I was handed a stack of gel colors that was thicker than my 6 inch medical journal. They offered everyone around me a drink (soda or water) but failed to offer me anything... The front desk chick rushed through potential (walk-in/scheduled) clients and talked to they staff as if they were children... Take off acrylic = $5. Plain color gel $28. If you want ‘rockstar’ sparkles, add at least $15 more... $50 for a full set... Came in with a friend and was asked if I was paying for the friend at least three times... After I said no the first time why keep asking me!?! No massage chair for the pedicure. Be ready to step up onto a pedestal in order to get your pedicure...  This was a one and DONE experience and I will NEVER come back!< /Text>< name>

I came in with a nail design I found on pinterest and they NAILED it. 😉 Pun intended.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

<Review>This place has gone downhill since the management change. The nail polish used to be organized by color and looked neat and tidy. That made it so easy to pick the color you were looking for. Looks like the current management doesn't take the time to do that. Also, making an appointment is hit and miss. Sometimes they'll see you, other times they won't. They still have a ton of color options, which tempts me to go there. But there are better salons in the area now.<//Review>< gmap_id>

Called right when they opened Friday morning I had the day off and wanted to start with a nice pedicure. They open 1 hour earlier than the other salons in the area. The gal told me come on in. She did not indicate that they were busy and had several incoming appts. They were very busy with a younger crowd, Lots of people for 9:15 a.m. the salon is well kept and very nice looking. HERES MY ISSUE....waited 1 hour and 15 minutes for my pedicure to begin. All the workers talk loudly amongst themselves and laugh and carry On. They make no we contact to anyone waiting, ever, and they don’t seem to be in any hurry to get on to the next customer. The very young , heavy-set gal at the front desk is nice when you first arrive but doesn’t command the team like most front desk people do that work in salons. The workers just talk , talk , talk and they don’t care how many people are waiting. After one hour I was finally put in the chair and there I waited another 15 minutes before she started on me. She was slow and kept getting up to get things instead of having them all ready to begin with. She worked on me for about 4 minutes before she started scolding me for the shape of my toenails as if I waited 2 years to do in! I have health issues and my skin is a bit tough, this is normal for my condition. I also have Arthritis which you can totally tell by looking at all my crooked toes. I don’t need to be scolded. If I could do it myself I would.
So while she’s telling me what awful shape my feet are in I’m correcting her and explaining that I have health issues. I don’t need to be scolded, I didn’t do anything wrong. I can’t help that I have health issues. I try to go once a month for a pedi but I admitted it was 7 weeks. SO WHAT! This is what you do for a living so take the good with the bad. Anyhow, she did take time with me but left out a couple things because of my sensitivity. She painted my toes and left and didn’t come back! The front desk gal wanted to boot me out with wet toes because SHE NEEDED THE CHAIR, after I waited 1.15 to even begin my pedicure. Seriously!? Then, she got upset and decided to not speak to me nicely like she was doing with everyone else. I had to give her the tip for my gal because she disappeared and never came back. Typically they help you put your sandals on and help you up and out when your a bit older - which I am. I not even know if my person got her tip.
Anyhow, my experience left me feeling really sad that these young ladies treat the older generation with such a lack of caring and a high level of disrespect. They too will get old one day and perhaps not be able to move well and care for themselves as they did before. I wonder if you treat your moms this badly? Or if you would appreciate it if she were treated that way??
****ONE TIP.....their chairs are on a platform and you have to step way up which might not be possible for everyone, older, pregnant, disabled. If you have any problems with stairs or stepping up, don’t go here. ******< /text>

< Review>
Worst nail shop ever. I had to wait 20 minutes for a mani even tho there were only 2 other customers inside. The girl at the counter has a very bad attitude, she tried to sit someone that came in after me. They don’t use clean tools and the whole shop looks dirty. They keep equipment in rusty containers. They don’t have a good selection of polish. The shop smells like rotten fish.< /Review>

Ok, hated the chairs, like a massage chair better.  Also get tired of all the talking especially in their language.  Not racist, just rude.</Text>

<review>Their mani pedi was great. However they messed up my eyebrows and after I told the lady she made one way shorter from the front than the other she said it was fine even though it was very noticable. Now I’m stuck with them till they grow back. 3 stars total though bc their nails did come out nice.< /review>< user_id>

<Text>I wish I didn't have to give any stars for this place. Yesterday I went for the very first time and was very disappointed in the service I received. I called at 10am and made a 1pm appointment. I told the girl that I'm going on my 1 hour lunch break and asked if there would be enough time for me to get a acrylic full set and a pedicure. She said yes. No problem see you at 1pm. So I get there at 1:07 and the place is packed. I check in with her and she says ok choose your color so I do. By now it's already 1:20. I asked if she's sure she'll have time. Then she says. Yes I'll take you right now. So she has me sit in a seat for 5 min then tells me to sit in a seat where they have the tub for your feet. Mind you. They didn't clean up the previous persons trash that was left behind. Disgusting. Before the woman starts on my hands. I ask her to be careful on my hand because I have a few cuts on them. One by my nail in particular. Then she goes on with her work and eventually scratches my wound. Anyway when I'm all done I go to pay and the lady asked if everything is ok. I say no. You left trash there. It's 2:30 I'm late for work. My nails could have used one more coat of polish. They could have been cleaned up underneath too. Also they left glue stuck on my fingers. Also told her why make an appointment if your not gonna follow through she said well it's because it's the holidays and I had two people work on you since you said your on lunch break which we normally don't have two people work on one person. Which is a lie. My co worker is the one who referred me saying they always have two people work on her. I'm never going back. Thanks for nothing.< /Text>< pictures>

This place is so cute I love the setup and the decor the service was very friendly it's a little bit more expensive then your typical hole in the wall nail salons but for the ambiance the service and the outcome of your nails and pedicures I think it's well worth a couple dollars more everyone should try this place at least once< /Review>

<review>I lost my phone this morning.

I stopped by this location to buy a phone. I got a really weird vibe from the manager. I handed him my ID and he claimed my account couldn’t be opened because my name was spelled “Davney” instead of “Dabney” on the account. Since my I.D. didn’t say “Davney,” he refused to help. Said there was nothing he could do and walked away without even trying. He even managed to get a chuckle out of watching me struggle.

So that same day, I went to the AT&T on Western and Wilshire. The manager at that location opened my account despite “Davney,” and she sold me a phone in 30 minutes.

Go to any other location besides this one. The manager has a chip on his shoulder.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Wow. I live two blocks away.  In the middle of LA. I was told I should drop ATT and maybe get Spectrum because apparently the best internet service available to my address is 5.56 mbps download .9 upload. LOL i never thought that after threatening to cancel for over a decade that ATT would basically do it for me. Unreal.</Text>

WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER! I'm a healthcare worker and when I signed up they told me to bring my work tag and they would add the discount, a couple of days later I went back with my tag. I'm not sure if this guy was the owner of this AUTHORIZED (because it's not an official store) location, but he was helping a customer with buying a phone, HE TOLD ME COME BACK ANOTHER DAY! And I replied but I'm here right now and he said yes but I am busy keep in mind I am Mexican and I was wearing sweats that day. So in his mind I look nothing like that Anglo American that he was helping with selling a phone. Do not waste your time there just go to the one off of La Brea and Santa Monica literally a three minute drive< /text>

This was seriously the best customer service I’ve experienced! Everyone was so helpful and nice, Cinthia helped me through my entire phone upgrade which took hours. Andy and Walter were also absolutely gentle and help solve all my questions about my bill. Great experience overall and very rare to find in LA<//Text>

Sales person Emmanuel was outstanding!!
Got me my phone of choice and I’m satisfied. Was extremely knowledgeable and friendly. Unfortunately I think that location should have better Wi-Fi five. The AT&T store should invest in putting a better wife five in the plaza.</text>

<Rating>4< /Rating><text>After going to 3 different stores at other locations, I finally decided to go to this one because the reviews are so high on Google and Yelp. They did not disappoint!

CYNTHIA IS OUTSTANDING

She is kind, patient, considerate and all the other things you don’t expect to receive when requesting customer service near closing time. Not only did she address my current phone issues but also addressed all future ones by sharing the capabilities of the 611 AT&T service. NONE of the previous stores told me I could resolve my concerns on my own. I have been going store to store when I could have just asked Cynthia at Sunset location. They also have a parking garage free with validation.

Needless to say, I plan to return and ask for her on my next visit.

Update:
Ultimately I still didn’t get my phone until three weeks later. It was lost in the UPS and no one figured that out until I initiated my own investigation. I got everything taken care of in one visit at the AT&T on Sepulveda.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Walter was phenomenal!

Walter is the store manager for ATT 8000 Sunset Blvd. I told him that I had a long night before and lost my phone last week.

Walter expressed empathy and made sure that I had a SIM card immediately for my older phone that I was using until my new one came in the mail using my insurance.

Without that SIM card I would have been in a bad position! Walter was very patient with me and provided me with options.

I see why ATT made Walter their store manager. He’s also very friendly and professional. I’m sure you all are so proud to have him on your team.

Thank you Walter!!<//review>

<Text>Went there about 50 minutes before they closed one night looking to open an account. The girl was extremely rude and uninterested since the moment i walked in. I get it was late and close to closing but I needed a phone and i figured since they sold phones, it wouldn’t be an issue. Then she pretended that the systems were down (bad acting by the way)</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>{'time': 1560269114717, 'text': "Gold, please accept our apology for the experience you had in our store!

Gave wrong plan and won't refund money after 20 mins.

<review>This a non-corporate store. I went here because they opened earlier than other store in the area. This was a mistake because they had an untrained representative unable to address activating a SIM card (called manager twice). Only option besides they offered were selling me another SIM card...

And of course to really win me over they stated their parking validation machine was broken.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

AVOID this place at all costs or you'll be sorry.  They sell grey-market i-phone merch that doesn't work and will NOT refund your money.  This location is a reseller NOT a  corporate store. BEWARE!!!🕷🦂🐍🚫🌪</Text>

Love how in the entrance they have seasonal items. Downfall is there never really organized. Alot of boxes. Sometimes cashiers aren't enough so they have to call to Open more lanes..The staff is NICE 🙂<//Review>

I have never been in a store in this much of a disarray. This store reminds me of my three year olds room after I thought he was down for his nap. The workers are not very helpful to the disabled. I suggest if you have a choice go some where else. This store is not for the elderly, disabled God forbid you a child in there.< /review>

<Text>-Employees work really hard especially the lady at the cash register. She is always sweet and kind.
-Dirty Store but recently getting better.
-You will find a lot of empties in the store as people may be walking around and eating and drinking at the same time and not paying for the items.
-They have great frozen foods as well.< /Text>< Pics>

Sometimes merch is thrown or scattered all over the place. Not all the employees very are nice or helpful. Small store with limited items but occasionally you can get some pretty good deals. If you're looking for a better store, then DollarTree in Lemon Grove is a much better place with much more space, better items, variety, and cleaner than this one in Spring Valley. This location in S.V. is nice since it's close and cheaper than other stores nearby, such as Albertsons, Big Lots, or Rite Aid. They do sell generic Nexium esomeprazole pills, Acetaminophen, Benadryl for only $1. Normally a bottle of 14 Nexium pills is at best $7, up to $10. Compare to Costco where 3 bottles of Nexium costs around $22-23, it'll cost you $3 to get 3 bottles for example.<//Text>

The store is a mess. It is by far the dumpiest Dollar Tree store that I have ever been in. Every other Dollar Tree store is much cleaner and better kept. Make yourself a favor and give your employees an extra shift for them to sort the mess. Have someone clean your floors. To the manager of the store, the way you allow the store to be in should really embarrass you.<//text>

I have to say this store looks much better! The store the last year was a disaster. No product, staff was horrible. I visited this store on 12/18/19 in the early morning. The new manager is doing great! Although the store is under staffed and could use more help on the floor, with customers and stocking of the store.</review>

<Text>The worst Dollar Tree I have ever visited. They would get negative stars if I could give them. No carts! Just hand baskets and a lot of them are missing handles. The place is a mess. Barely any organization of products on shelves. Most aisles everything is all mixed up. I would watch the expiration dates at this store. Obviously the store management doesn't care about anything. How is it that the corporate management lets this go on?<//Text>< pics>

The shelves are never fully stocked with products. They rarely have helium. The staff is usually nice and helpful. I'd recommend going to another dollar store bc with this one it's a 50/50 chance of them having what you're looking for.</Text>

< Review>
.... Unfortunately this particular Dollar tree is an embarrassment. Their shelves are always empty. And do I mean empty. There are also strange vibes coming from employees. They seem really tense. Almost nervous. There is another Dollar tree in spring valley on Campo road that is completely opposite of this one. If it wasn't for the uniform you might think that you wandered into a thrift store in Mexicali  or TJ..... And I'm not trying to be rude. I'm just saying.....< /Review>

A heavyset Spanish employee with glasses and a goatee barred my friend from entry at 8:53pm. I then waled up at 8:57pm and he outright lied and said it was 9:00 and they were closed? Both doors were propped wide open when we arrived and there were numerous customers including one gentleman who walked in seconds before my friend tried to patron the store. Im not sure what kind of management is responsible for such rude, unprofessional and flatout financially foolish to discourage and even prevent an unknown potentially large purchase. I would never recommend this location to anyone I know and I won't be spending any money with this store until a acknowledgement and professional apology is addressed or offered by someone in management!< /Review>

<Text>I appreciate the low prices but i expect good customer service any place regardless if I’m spending 10$ or 150$ dollars you should still be kind to customers so they return. While shopping inside i was told around 8:40 very rudely they’ll be closing soon i said alright then which followed with a loud sigh and her walking away 5 minutes later i was told again and asked if I’m lost or looking for something. YES I’m shopping stop harassing me with your attitude because you don’t like your job. The employees ruined the whole store they need to hire a new team they all were rude and in my personal opinion don’t want to be there. No one wants to go to work but if it’s your job to present and act a certain way for a couple hours. If you want a check you should know every customer in your store is providing that!</Text><GmapID>0x80d950f57cd52233:0x2e8d8943855350a1< /GmapID><pics>None<//pics><name>Angelina Steppers<//name>< Rate>

Small store, but we'll stocked in many areas. Not many cashiers. Friendly staff and lots of parking and a variety of retail stores in the same market area. Starbucks, McDonald's, Godfather's pizza and a Little Caesars nearby.</Text>

< Review>
It's always miserable going in this store the line is always so long and they going to get one cashier I seen it as many as 10 people in mine with only one cashier they need to close the store down or get new management in there I'll tell you what call me my name is Charles and I'll manage the store and I guarantee you'll have more people working cashiers< /Review>

I had a great experience at DD's today I walked in to the after-Christmas sales and picked up a handbag that I had been eyeballing during Christmas the original price of the handbags $15.99 and today that same handbag was marked down to $3.49 , so I was very happy with my purchase.<//Text>

This place has definitely gotten more expensive over the years but who can blame them in today's economy right. Overall their selection is large and full of all different sizes styles and prices. I dont really care for the sudden price raise but the quality of the merchandise is well worth it< /review>

< Review>
Store was great. Lots of items for everyone. Not as crowded as I thought. Well kept (racks and shelves not over stocked, not ran through looking or messy). The parking lot is something else. I seen a honk off between three cars for a front row parking which was nuts, while another honk off  started. In which I seen a middle-aged​ woman yell to someone in the handicap parking right in front of the store. Asking if the person whom parked there, was aware that it was a handicap parking...the woman was elderly with a cane and said I am handicap. But overall satisfied with my day visit to the city and store from 92 miles away.<//Review>

There is always a greeter at the door. More often than not, they don't have the right sizes I need. Finding things you want here are hit or miss. Most things are a cheap price and good quality.< /text>

Store was in disarray so it made it impossible to find the clothes in my size. I think it's more the patrons fault than the employees, people just would take stuff off the rack then leave it laying on top of another rack. The employees were nice, however, and prices were good on items I saw.<//review>

Oh my, what didn't I like about dds..?! I bought 4 pair of shoes. A pair of pants, a blouse lotion air freshener and a few other things for only $40.00.  It's a relaxing atmesphere no one is watching over your shoulder. Their prices are very affordable and everything is priced. It's really your one stop shop.< /Review>

<text>I love the odd things you can find here that would be super pricey elsewhere, still good though and the employees are friendly and they seem passive and chill in a good way . Security here is awesome really cool and chill . They still take their work serious too. So don't underestimate them either.<//text>< pics>

<Text>The prices are great you can find just about everything in this store. The only thing that I don't like is the long lines to pay they should open all registers when they see the line is getting longer they usually only have 2 open<//Text>< Pics>

Google states that the store closes at 10pm on Saturday, but the door was closed before 9pm we wanted to go in but the female security was playing her phone inside and told us it is closed! So disappointed!!!!!!!! If it closes at 9, it should say closes at 9 instead of 10 pm on the website. Please update your business hours!!!!!!!!😡<//text>

Long wait in line & store is not well organized every thing messed up. You need to see all department to find what you are looking for. Price is right.</Review>

<text>Went to return something and I didn't have my debit card, I had my receipt. They wouldn't give me the cash. My choice was store credit or nothing.
I think they should've asked me did I have my card before starting the transaction not when it's the last part of it.<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< name>

(Translated by Google) Well, there are good things and bad things looking for something good to grab, but before I was well stocked, I imagine that everything is due to the virus and the economy. But it's a good place if you don't want to spend a lot of shoes. I do not recommend breaking them and they last you a maximum of 1 week

(Original)
Bueno hay cosas buenas y cosas malas buscando agarra algo bien pero;antes estaba muy surtida me imagino que todo es por el virus y la economía. Pero es buen lugar si no quieres gastar mucho zapatos. No los recomiendo de romper y te duran un máximo de 1 semana<//review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Very good place to find what you need. The only thing I do not understand how people throw things away and do not pick it up, it is something unpleasant to have to jump or trample things with the carts. I try to pick up but it is impossible since it's in almost the entire store ..

(Original)
Muy buen lugar para encontrar lo que nesecitas.lo unico que no entiendo como la gente deja tiradas las cosas y no la recoje, es algo desagradable tener que andar brincando o pisoteando las cosas con los carritos.yo trato de recojer pero es imposible ya que es en casi toda la tienda..< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x808fcd5d1e33ed0f:0xcd255d1137ae1e1c< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Bad, very bad, this they only do in the white one, in all others enter the bathroom, that's why I don't like going to this store !!!!!
