Did a great job I can’t lie. Looks just as new as the day I got it from the dealer. The staff were really nice too. This is the only place I will be going for sure. Have been to 2 other car wash places that messed up my wheels but they took great care not to mess it up and I appreciate that.< /text>

Staff is very experienced and follow COVID-19 protocol. Plenty of hand sanitizers, and chairs outside are six-feet distance of each other. Lots of workers. They not only do car washes but servicing such as oil changes and brake checks. Inside facility sells refreshments, novelty items, and car accessories. Bathrooms are Gender Neutral. There’s also windows to see your car being washed.< /review>

<Text>100% unsatisfied with the service. I paid $41 and had to tell them to vacuum properly. They washed my plastic mats and put them back in all wet still. Had to tell them to dry off my mats when It should be common sense. And worst of all they left these horrible scratch marks on my driver side rear panel that were not there before I came in. I know 100% because I had just pumped gas, and they were right by my pump door. I highly recommend people to not waste their time or money here. First and last time ever going.< /Text><resp>None</resp>< user_id>

They were so detailed, reviewed my car numerous times, & did so much more than many other car wash businesses I have gone to. I am extremely happy with their job & will be a regular here as well!

<Review>I asked for a 100% hand wash, i paid $29 but i later saw some light scratches on the car and checked video from dashcam, the two guys inside were scrubbing the car with brushes ? Leaving scratches on the paint. If you like to keep your paint like new. Dont go there for hand wash.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

Been a long time customer, always get my oil changed by them. I always wash my car myself, but when I don't they're the only car wash that I go to. I am extremely picky about my car, and they're the only car wash that are up to my standards. And they offe fantastic customer service as well.<//review>

My husband and I took both of our cars there for a car wash and detail. The cars had water spots all over and the inside was not cleaned well at all. When we complained to the manager, he was so rude and very unprofessional.  His attitude was the worst ! They really need to replace him.  The male cashier was not much help either. Customer satisfaction is not important to them even though their website displays otherwise. This family owned business should invest in customer service training. We will never go there again.<//review>

I read about unfortunate situations that people had with management at this place but I still gave it the benefit of the doubt. I had got my car washed here several times before and have had no problem. Today I decided to get my car washed at this place once more. To make thing go quicker I decided to vacuum and clean the interior of the car. When my car was ready to be dried I told the person who was ready to clean the interior of my car in spanish to focus on drying the outside of my car and the windows because I had already cleaned the interior of my car and didn't want to wait any longer. While I was speaking to the guy I was rudely interrupted by a bald guy who only had hair around the sides of his head. He asked me what I was requesting from his worker. I told him that I wanted my car dried and windows cleaned. Before I could tell him what I had told his worker he interrupted me and said that what I was asking for was not covered in the basic wash that I had purchased. If a dry car and clean windows is too much to ask for when purchasing the basic wash at this place, I will just go to a different site to get my car washed. I still tipped the guy who dried my car because it is not his fault that his manager is so rude and unprofessional. I don't know what is up that bald guys @$$. I will NEVER go to this place again. For 15.95 I can get better service at another car wash location.<//review>

This is a really good car wash. They might throw away all your water bottles and papers/trash, brand new or not if there left in the interior of the vehicle unless you specify them not to. Over all It's a great car wash and they do a really good job. Definitely recommend!  The staff / owners are great too! I’ve been going here for years and they take good care of me and my car. Any issues are resolved quickly.  You can’t go wrong here. :-)<//Review>

Caught an attitude from the person at the register when I took my car key off the key ring. She tried to grab it and said, "We're busy!" I pulled my keys back and said that I'll take my car to a wash that isn't too busy to treat me nicely. She explained that my car was already in the queue and her tone changed to slightly nicer - but I will take my business to the car wash on Carson and Pioneer next time.<//Review>

<Review>Quick competent service for both the car wash and oil change.  Price for the combo package was about average as compared to other places we looked.  They did try to upsell on a variety of car wash options.  The wait time was very short when we were there, so happy about that.  Many choices of interior scent, though the aroma did not last very long</Review>< rate>

<review>I went in today to get a oil change with a free car wash. I asked a employee are they certified to change the oil. I guess I might have pissed him off with that question but he cursed at me ask me what the f*** do I look like asking him something like that. When I brought it to the manager attention she claims she didn't hear what he said, of course because you're inside and we're outside but she definitely wasn't concerned. I was then told by the manager that only the dealer is certified which is not true. I explained to her that Jiffy Lube is certified which is not a dealer. After I explain that that's when she got nasty.. Her attitude and demeanor was nasty it was like do you want the oil change and the car wash? ME:  of course not.. this place is disrespectful toward thier customers.<//review>< user>

<username>Kevin Patel</username><userid>114842370255614703028</userid><Review>I got an oil change from this location several months ago because it came with a complimentary car wash. However, when I went back to Firestone (which is the original location I go for oil changes), they detected that the oil pan on my car was stripped. In order for firestone to complete the process, they would have to remove the entire part that was damaged, costing me around $600 to replace. I decided to contact this business and ask if they can resolve this issue in any way, and they responded to me saying that when a car gets old, these things are bound to happen and that they have no responsibility for it. How is it that I've been getting oil changes on my car for 10 years, and this is the first occurrence where a part gets damaged because "my car got old"?<//Review><Time>1564789581262</Time>< GmapID>

I love the way they wash and detail my car. I've come here for about 7 years. But recently with a new truck that I bought a year or two back, they've been charging me more and more when I go. I feel as though I'm being taken advantage of because I am a woman and a loyal customer. I received a car wash and oil change today and was charged $5 more from the one I received 3 months ago. I was told the next time I come to request a certain car wash so that the price does not go up, but when I request a car wash they will not do it. I am never going back there.< /text>

<Date>1468626076056< /Date><Text>Came here based on reviews & I should have listened to Chris L. I also typically don't like to let others touch my car, but I wanted to get a Complete Interior Detail & restore the headlights. Saw the pricing picture on Yelp & the guy that took my info & what I wanted done for my car gives a price based on whatever he feels like giving at the moment.

The wash is NOT a hand wash quality job. There were spots all over my car from water & whatever the white residue  is they failed to wipe off all over the front bumper. They left enough to water to leave even more marks on my car's paint.

The headlight restoration, unless you are planning to repaint your car, I extremely advise to NOT have it done here.  They managed to scratch off paint above the headlights. After they were done taking the tape off from around the bottom of the headlights, each of the people working here inspected it. Why they call that quality is beyond the normal comprehension.

I'll admit that the guys working on my car worked hard, but when a poor quality of work is the outcome, that is just sad. Needless to say, I will not be returning.<//Text></record>

<Text>Best car wash in the HG/LB/Lakewood area.  The detailers are meticulous and take their time in each car they service.  And if you get they're car wash card, you get your tenth car wash free.<//Text>< Gmap_id>

<Review>They are not accurate about there price for car wash. The car wash boy that we asked for the price can't even give us any information about the price. Thay have a post that says the packages but the manager still have to check your car yo give you the price for the wash. And the manager i think named harry is so rude when I asked for the receipt he said he doesnt have time to give it to me. Until the car was finished he didnt give me any receipt.</Review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

The only reason this has 1 star is because 0 stars isn't an option. I will NEVER set foot in the establishment ever again. It has nothing to do with the quality of their work, and EVERYTHING to do with the manager/owner, Perry. That's what I was told his name is.
So I pull up at 5pm, which leaves an hour before closing. I exited my car and told Perry that I would like the VIP wash. He immediately turns to me and says, so rudely, "No. You can't do that one." Then he turns his back on me. I asked which ones I CAN get and he doesn't answer. So when he finally turns to me, I ask for the deluxe wash. Then he rolled his eyes and said, "the minimum is luxury." Keep in mind, luxury is the ONLY wash between the two that I asked for. If that was the ONLY wash available, he could've  said so rather than snapping at me.
So, I say ok. I'll get that one.
In the past, the guys there merely move at items on the floor (which right now consist of ONE small bag and a car bin), so they can vacuum , and they leave it at that. PERRY, looks down at the bag and scolds me saying, "what do you want me to do with this? If you want me to clean your car YOU have to organize this. What am I supposed to do with this?" I was completely taken aback with hiw he spoke to me. It was completely uncalled for. So I simply say, "you know, you are the RUDEST person I have EVER delay with here. I don't knkw what your problem is, but I'm leaving.
I get back in my driver's seat, and he stays standing by my car for some reason. As I slowly pull back and het ready to drive out, I say, "excuse me, are you the manager?" To that he rolls his eyes and turns his back to me," so I got even more upset and yes, I did raise my voice, repeating the question. To that he says, "don't you yell at me." I was like, well don't turn your back on me when I'm talking to you. I repeat a 3rd time, my question. He says he is the manager and owner and that there is no one above him there. I was very surprised because i really have NEVER dealt with ANYONE so incredibly rude.
So, after this experience with Perry, I will NEVER go back - and I'm sure he doesn't care, but if you care about how you're treated don't go here. You know I've worked in the service industry for many years, and It doesn't matter what time it is, how tired you are, what is going on in your life, or of the customer just doesn't  click with you. You treat people with respect, and provide the service -especially if its literally your job to do so. PERRY, doesn't seem to understand that, and it's upsetting... and disturbing. He was so rude, right off the bat, for no reason. It's a shame because i know what it's like to deal with crappy people and hard work in hot temperatures all day... but I never took it out on other customers. Perry, is a horrible manager.<//text>

I’ve never been to this conference before but I saw some good reviews so I decided to try it since I was in the area. The Employee that was helping me never said hello or smile he was very very rude – combative as if he didn’t even want to be there. It made me very uncomfortable. I never post reviews but unbelievable bad service. I won’t be back< /review>

Damaged the paint on my mercedes and was very rude when I brought it to their attention. They are nice until something like this comes up, and then they show their true self. This damage is noticeable and costly. will be taking them to court. The spots look like it was possibly done with  something in a spray bottle, because of the shape and in spots. They have a lot of spray bottles floating around, all there together with different stuff in them. I believe they hit a few spots on my car with a spray bottle with the wrong stuff. some of those bottles contain stuff you don't put on the paint. For the most part, these people do a good job. I have family members that go there, but this time they f--ked up, and was really nasty about it, would barely even look at the damage. It's easy to be nice, when all you have to do is speak and smile, or get a spot you missed but the possibility of a mistake that my cost them, the nasty comes out, that's not good business.< /text>

When I went back to let them know about the bad work they did they said they will not touch it anymore because I did not buy my parts from them. Parts are brand new drilled and slotted rotors with carbon ceramic pads screeching like nails on a chalk board? What angers me is they didn't want to check to see if maybe they missed a step on the work they did. They refused to look at it. So now I am filing a complaint to BAR(Bureau of Automotive Repair).< /review>< user>

{'time': 1439664302015, 'text': 'You were notified that there is no warranty when the customer provides the Parts, and we explained that this is due to the quality of parts.  We did check your car and we test drove it,  you were informed that these pads make noise on the day of the service and when you returned. Its on your invoice.  Prior to working on this car you were notified "there is no warranty."  Due to the vast variety of aftermarket support and endless sea of parts, it\'s very easy to get your hands on a "bad" set. After the service, we were also concerned with the squeaking, we proceeded to check our work for the third time. What I can recommend is that you check with the manufacturer of the parts to see if they supply any sort of warranty, usually what happens is that they also cover labor warranty and will cover the costs to redo the brake job with the right parts to not make noise. This is a common practice with dealers and parts suppliers. The reason we do not warranty the parts, is simply because of reasons like this, and we don\'t trust them. We purchase and use trusted pads and rotors that we have personally tested through our 15 years in business for any noise, fade, or defects. Thus, we can and do offer a 1 year, 12,000 mile warranty along with our brake service. We will still be happy to help and fix the situation at hand, please contact the parts supplier and check their labor warranty, this is a chance have your labor price refunded.'}<//Resp>

<review>Most carwashes seem to do a half keistered job these days, most of the ones closer to my house do a terrible job, I won't name names here, one usually does a very poor job on the windows, the windshield being the worst most of the time, another uses such a cheap tire shine product that it has worn off in the 1/4 mile drive home, and the las that I frequent usually does a poor job on the chrome bits.

I went to this one on a whim, I was driving someplace else and had to drive by this car wash to get there.  I saw a couple of nicer cars, the type of which normally comes with a picky owner, so I thought "I'll give it a try." They did not disappoint, one of the managers was out amongst the cars as they were being dried and polished pointing out spots that were missed or could be improved.  Their prices are a bit higher than others around, I will happily pay the premium for the service delivered.  As long as this quality keeps up, it is fair to say they have earned a customer for life.<//review><response>None<//response></record>

Guy has a lot of attitude, they posted carpet shampoo $44.99 but after inspecting my mini van he says $195 I said you posted $44.99 then he says that’s not for your car. Ok if it is $45 for sedan charge me 90 but $195 is just 4 times more than posted price.< /text>

<Text>This is the worst car washing service I have ever been too, they charge a lot of money for such a poor job on your car. They take a long time to clean your car. I have a Truck and though I expected it to take a while I watched as they rolled the truck out of the garage and left it under there canopy for a whole 1 1/2 hours before anyone got to the truck. I will never go to this place again.<//Text>< Pictures>

They have moved to a new location which is a more open and modern space. Parking remained at the same spot which is helpful. Yeni was great with X-rays very patient and kind. Viviana has a welcoming personality with friendly and fun vibes. The front office staff was helpful as well. My kids felt at ease with Janette doing their cleaning.</text>

< Review>
Horrible service. Staff was not friendly. Everyone was more interested in watching the car pursuit in the news than paying attention to the patients. I had an appointment at 4pm and arrive 10 minutes early. They were calling in everyone else that was just coming in. At 4:50pm I got up to ask about my kids and they didn’t even know where their file was at. I had taken my kids when they were at the old location and now they said they didn’t have no record of them, like how. Just horrible service at this new location.<//Review>

Worst kids dentists! I don’t recommend this place to anyone. They would put silver teeth on kids for no reason. I got a second opinion and my kids teeth were healthy 😠 Don’t bring your kids here.</Review>

<Review>This is the only shop gives quality cuts and other services without you having to spend way too much. Both have friendly staff and perform their services very well. They have well-trained barbers who could cut your hair awesomely. I really appreciate them for doing a good job! Thanks a lot!< /Review><resp>None</resp>< user_id>

Visiting your barbershop was the best thing I did! I went there last Friday afternoon because I want to have a new haircut. I was very fortunate because Elvin was the assigned staff. This young guy did an amazing job of cutting my hair and I really like the result of his work. Thanks a lot, guys! See you next time!< /text>

<Text>First time going there and was greeted with a friendly attitude. However, i left this shop BLEEDING. the Barber who took it upon himself to give me the worst Mid-fade I've ever had. He was not professional at all and had no regard to try and fix his error. fade is poor, blend non-existent, and I have cuts everywhere. STAY AWAY!!!!< /Text>< pictures>

I been coming to this place for almost 10 years — and still paying 16$ plus tips - in and out-every one is experience great place—always pack -but if you want-to spend 30$+ on a cute looking barbershop be my guess-don’t forget the selfie 😂😂😂😂< /text>

Amazing service fast and friendly all barbers are proficient in the modern day cuts that are "in" I've been getting services here for as long as I can remember. No complaints whatsoever... Busy days are Friday Saturday early evening... So plan accordingly walk-ins are welcomed always!<//Review>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>My boyfriend is a loyal customer has been going there since high school and he loves how David cuts his hair. Ever since my son was old enough we started taking him there as well and David never disappoints. The only downside is the wait time, everyone wants a cut from David so if your willing to wait then he’ll get the job done.<//review>< Pictures>

Went for the first time last week. This is going to be my regular barbershop. Dope cuts, cheap prices, good location, no long wait time--I walked in without an appointment. I would rate 10 stars if I could!

$13 cuts
$4 beard trims

Definitely the best barbershop I've found in LA!<//Text>

I came here 5 times since it's really close to me. I didn't like the fact that they used the same blade from the previous cut, not so clean with the equipment. I didn't really like the fade they do, I ask for a low fade, by the time I get out of the barbershop its a high fade. The only good thing is that they open early and close late.<//review>

If I could rate 0 stars I would the dude butcher my hair. one side of my hair is longer than the other what a mess man never coming back here. Beware I felt him cut a little much from the top as he was doing the sides but he denied cutting it wrong. $13 for a hair cut from this place a is a robbery.<//Text>

I walked in and was completely ignored so I started asking the men cutting hair if they took debit and if I could get a haircut, but none of them spoke English. I sat around waiting for about 30 mins and eventually walked about because I didn't think I would ever get anywhere. They seemed very slow and sleepy.<//text>

If u have time to spend in here it's totally worth it. They have such adorable shoes, blouses, dresses ,and accessories. They  usually have different colored tags on the merchandise and depending on the date it is I have gone home with like 6 blouses for a $1.50 each .< /Text>

Tomorrow  I will be back with  my truck for a patio set that  caught my eye again Great store.<//text>< Rate>

<text>Have been looking for a good deal on a piano for my seven year old.  They had their half priced sale today and tomorrow.  They had an old piano that needed a little TLC.  Was on sale for $275, got it for half that.  Worth every penny.  Great find. :)</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

We were immediately folowed around by one of the employees. Who pretended to sweep up fake trash from the floor.  They seemed very prediodious and made us feel very uncomfortable and unwelcomed constantly staring at us like we were going to take something. As an active member of the Lutheran Church and a US veteran i feel very ashamed that this thirft store repersents my religion. The clothes and shoes were very outdated and furniture was old and dusty I don't recommend this place save your money.< /Review>< pictures>

I have been a thrift shop shopper for many years.  I found this thrift shop to be well organized.  I went there labor day weekend and everything in the store was half price.  Great!!!  The staff was friendly enough.  I rate it 4 stars only because they did not have a dressing room and I personally will not buy
any clothing without trying it on.  I don't care how cheap it is it still has to look good.<//review>

<text>The best place in town for music lovers. The best staff, absolutely lovely tutors on the premises, a really solid selection of guitars/basses, plus the chance of the occasional oddity guitar coming through. Great deals, great service, great people, great music. What's not to love?</text><username>Lily-Rose Stardust</username></record></dataset><record>

One of them to maximum 3 music gear guitar stores et C. Staying in business so that guitarist like I can walk in and buy something off the shelf still. I don't mind buying things online but walking into a guitar shop is an experience in and of itself. Go there, use their services by gear, from what I can tell they sell used instruments so that they can stay afloat. I have plenty of new things too specially strings accessories and stuff like that, but these places are becoming hard to find and need the support the community so get your ass in there keep the music alive.</Review>

I have purchased many guitars from Dan and the Crew over the years.  Only one time did a used Guitar I bought have a problem... Dan had it fixed and back in my hands within a couple of days.  They are always fair... and the prices are good.   I'm glad I have a Great local music store to visit!

Keep it up!<//review>

Bought a roland jx10 from him in feb 2013 said he had it professionally cleaned cause one of the keys did not respond.( shoulda took that as a sighn right there that this would go south.)
Got the roland a week later patch buttons did not work cardtridge port was busted cause he shipped the cardtridge inside of the synth and the internal battery was dead.
Talk to him about going to repair man he got upset and said his repair man pro clean it and made sure it was in running order.
Took it to repair man costed 166.00 he begrudglingly said fine send him receipt.
So rapair man did two weeks go by no response.
The owner is a bs'er and a finagler.
Do not support.
Do not trust.
Eventually we will cross paths Dan.
Thats not a threat.
Thats a promise.< /review>< Pictures>

I ordered the bass a year ago in this shop! But so far, they can not send me a bass and do not return the money! What are the problems? I do not know! And nothing intelligible do not meet!<//review>

Come to try the pizza, return for the beer selection. The bar next door to Pie is a great small place to hang out and have a delicious craft beer with friends. Food favorites are the Diablo pizza, caprese salad and a campfire pie for desert!<//Review>

<Review>At first, I was a little hesitant about coming to bar with my girlfriend because it was pricey. however what found is this bar is really chill and fun. It is Definitely worth the price! If could say I had amazing time at a bar it would be here most definitely! The bartender does a better job than even a flight attendant would do in flight. I would recommend this bar to any friends! Especially when Daniel is bartending. He is cool and the drinks are great. 4 stars for sure<//Review><UserId.>115723832348914609880< /UserId.>< pics>

We had a little while for our food (we ordered st the counter) but the customer service was great! Such nice guys and then the pizza...we got El Diablo and Mac n Cheese- Mac was delicious! The sauce on top is so tastey and el diablo was not TOO spicy, which I preferred. Will be coming back!< /text>

Went over the weekend with the family. Hubby loved the oven baked wings and both kids loved the pizza. I loved how little sauce they used! Also ordered a small wedge which was awesome with crispy bacon and gorgonzola. I finished the whole thing! Definitely going back with our without the family!< /Text>

< review>
The Pizza is honestly to die for as i am a daily eater here but it’s also extremely expensive for an area with a burger joint right next to it i can go and get a mean for 6$ there instead of coming here and paying 13 dollars for a personal pizza and a drink. sure the quality is good and the pizza tastes amazing but still 13$ is way to much. and for anyone else wanting to eat there but is vegan not such a good idea every time i’ve gotten a salad the crotons have been stale or soft and chewy. like come on it’s CROUTONS how do you mess up croutons the owner is a good guy and a great chef but he needs to focus on customer happiness. Good food but still the service and pricing need some adjustments.<//review>

We ordered several pizzas, they were all horrible and tasted like we were eating cardboard 4 people out of 11 ate the mushroom pizza and all 4 of us have been sick! The teenagers making the pizza had long hair no hair nets, no gloves and no sanitation while cooking! Shocker we are all so sick! No sauce either! The worst pizza ever! The owner offered a free pizza, and was sorry, too late! If you value your health don’t eat here!<//Text>

I was between classes and thought I'd give this place a try for lunch. There was a man who watched me right before I put my disability card up park in the handicap spot and shot me a dirty look and shook his head. I walked in anyway (I can only walk short distances) and put my card up, he watched me as I came in, turns out he works there! He then walked into the back said something to his coworker and didn't give me service. I walked out and I was driving away as he watched me from the door? Not all disabilities are visible and I'll stick to the Starbucks across the way.</Review>

This was the worst pizza experience I've ever had.  We were the first to order,  and last served.  When the pizza came or,  the crust was under cooked and floppy.  It was overloaded with toppings on one side,  and made too spicy throughout for my children to eat.  The owner is friendly,  but was tone deff when we declined the option of having another pizza made.  We ate the best we could,  but it was not a good pie. They need to learn how to prep pizza,  and how you serve customers in order.  I will not be returning.< /Text>

Do not eat at or support this dishonest establishment!!!!! Custom Pie owes Joe Grandstaff $13,221.02 in wage claims this company is very dishonest one man in particular Phil Adler the owner has chosen to not pay a cancer patient with a 4 year old daughter wages owed even though the court has ordered to do so.< /review>

Horrible toppings, really bad crust, overall a really bad pizza. I usually don't bad mouth but wow I don't know how they are still in business. The customer service was bad as well, and way over priced. Frozen pizza from Wallmart is better and that is saying a lot. Do not waste your money!!!< /review>

<Review>If I could give ZERO stars I would. The atmosphere in this restaurant is dull and uninviting. And the pizza was mediocre at best. They have a lot of variety, but the overall quality is not really worth the price.
And furthermore, it has come to my attention that the owner of this business, Phil Adler, is a crooked business man who hires employees and then when payday comes around he claims that he does not have any funds to pay them.
This business boasts fair business practices, yet the owner, Phil, hired Joe Grandstaff as a manager in 2015, let him work for 3 weeks, and then informed him that he would not be getting paid his full wages. So long story short, Phil Adler owes Joe $13,221.02 in wage claims.
Phil Adler has put all of his assets in other people's names, just so honest hard working employees like Joe are not able to go after him to collect owed wages. Even after going through all of the proper channels and getting a court order Phil has still managed to dodge the payments, EVEN AFTER THE COURTS ORDER HIM TO DO SO. Phil has made it to look as though he has no available funds, income or liquid-able assets. This guy is a real piece of work.  This man consciously hired, lied to and then refused to pay a cancer survivor who is trying to get back on his feet and provide for his family.
Seriously people DO NOT SUPPORT this business.
...and if you do support this business just keep in mind that you are supporting a lying, crooked cheater who steels from family's and cancer patients.<//Review>< Pictures>

Best quality pizza place around! Favorite pizza there is the Loretta and next up is the Spinaci for a white pizza.
Make sure to get the Roasted Asparagus and Roasted Brussel Sprouts appetizers as they are well worth it!</text>

<text>Fantastic find.  We are so glad we found this place and will be back for more soon.   Super fresh/high quality ingredients and fantastic menu options.   We had the bruschetta,  the ham and bacon pannini,  and Brussel sprout salad.   Wow.  Nothing disappointed.  We've had similar dishes as far more fancy places and the others aren't even in this league.< /text>< pics>

February dental cleaning for canine 15 0/0 off. Very reasonable prices. You don't have to be one of there patient. I dropped off my little 6 lb. Yorkie 9 years old and has never had a dental cleaning appt. He's been sneezing for four months on and off. 3 Dr appt all saying he needs a dental cleaning, that might take care of the sneezing. They were looking for a foxtail or saying it's a cold. Unfortunately he had 6 teeth pulled today. Saying he had an abscess in a cainine tooth. I'm hoping he will get better soon. He came home with more antibiotics and a inflammatory medication. He's been taking these for 10 days since October every 2-3 weeks, on and off. Hopefully today we took care of the problem. King City Veterinary Hospital is very reasonably priced and had an opening this month. So I've been looking forward to this visit. I spoke with the Dr when I picked him up and the Dr called again tonight at 8:30 pm checking on him because he did have some nasal drip with some blood. His nasal still sounds wet. But it should get better. He's been very quiet but does whimper and whine ,very quietly. I need to call the office in the morning and give a report on how he did but over night. He doesn't want to eat or drink anything so I can't get him to take his meds tonight. I don't want to force his mouth open to poor down the two meds, but they require food for his tummy. He doesn't want any part of opening his mouth, understandable. Looks like we might be going here for any new appts. It is an hour drive away from home. But it looks like better service, caring office. Thank you for taking care of my dog.<//Text>

<Review>The King City Veterinarian Hospital has been indispensable to me, and my pets, throughout the years.  Dr. Cheney had cared for one of my pets from cradle to the grave (16 years).  He, and his staff, are caring and transparent about procedures and cost.  I am very grateful we have such an accommodating vet in our remote area.</Review>< user_name>

<text>I bring my dogs here for their rabies vaccines.  They have a rabies shot clinic from 12 to 1 pm a couple days of the week.  The clinic is on a walk in basis and a rabies shot is only $12.  This is not a yearly shot. This is a 3 yr rabies shot. $12 every 3 yrs-- cant beat that deal! Because they offer a clinic several times a month, the wait is very short. In addition, the staff are all very polite, courteous, and very efficient.  The clinic is clean and appealing.  I highly recommend this clinic to everyone.  My dogs and I will continue coming here. Thank you for taking great care of my boys.</text>< user_name>

I bring both of my dogs to this place. The staff is super friendly and informative if you have any questions. I'm usually in and out within 20 minutes . This place offers vaccinations every Wednesday and Saturday at a discounted price so it's very convenient. I would suggest to go on Wednesdays because Saturdays gets mad packed. I got a puppy package for my first dog it's about $200  it you can do payments . It offers all of the vaccines, and discounted rates for many services<//Review>

<text>Super friendly and explained everything well. So happy that they called me to update me on my kittens recovery!! Appointment time may seem a bit long sometimes but if someone cancels they do call you to get you in ASAP. If you request that. Overall I'm very happy with my visit here.<//text>< UserId.>

these awesome ladies just helped be safe on the freeway - with my new prize; a lovely recliner set out by a ranchers wife (i'm assuming lol)

but it's a gem, and the staff at King City Vet jumped to help

and they let me use restroom - barefoot 😳

I WOULD BRING MY MOST BELOVED ANIMAL TO THESE WOMEN

His incompetency killed my dog. He did blood tests on my twice in two weeks. My dog died from anemia, that was not treated. Vet never told me.
He miss it or did not care.
My neighbors cat was killed, when he mix it up with a stray brought in.
Stray was spayed and pet cat killed (couple years ago).
Ask around, people in KC ( who have been here for years) go elsewhere, not to him.< /text>< rate>

Eric answered all my questions and even called me while my rear end damage repairs were getting done to let me know more or less when my car would be ready. Very professional, Thank you..

<Text>There was some slight damaage to the rear fender on the driver's rear fender that was NOT there before the car was delivered. As I did not notice the damage until two days later, I did not bring it up to Caliber Collision.  I was positive it occurred while in their possession .<//Text>< Time>

The best shop in the valley. The staff are very professional and friendly. Robert the manager, took my car in right away and took care of me. Stephanie in the front office made the check in process simple and easy. She also helped me with getting my rental car. Steve the estimator did a really good job keeping me informed and updated on my car while it was being fixed. I want to thank all of you that worked on my car. The paint job and repairs look like factory new. My Acura looks better then ever.< /review>

I went in for an estimate for some minor scratches on my vehicle and the shop was helpful by just taking my car to the back and buffing out the problem with no cost to me. I loved their customer service and professionalism. I'll be returning if I have any other problems with my vehicles. And I will always recommend this shop. Thank you guys!< /Text>

I’ve had 2 new cars repaired here and the work has been fantastic!  In both cases I got the car back on time or early.  The staff has been very friendly, honest and professional.  I was referred by Toyota Of The Desert and they returned my cars looking like new.  Thank you Caliber.</Review>

From day one, I spoke with Robert about taking my 1200 dollar aftermarket bumper home and reinstalling it myself due to the issue that it wasn't covered by insurance. All that was damaged was a tab that's easily replaceable with quick latches. when I got that bumper a month later it was torn apart, scratched, broken, and incomplete. I spoke with their general manager Todd to help me figure out why on earth they would even tear apart my bumper. He said had no idea and then said we usually charge $150 to give a bumper back. But how are you going to charge me for a ruined and incomplete bumper?!?! He then said he'll get back to me in a couple days. 2 weeks go by and nobodies called me so I had to post on Twitter how terrible my experience was in order to reach Brad, their area manager and he said he'd call me back in 2 days. 2 weeks go by and I call him because I guarantee he wouldn't have, he said there's nothing they could do for me and that Robert never wrote in the report I'd be taking back my bumper. even tho I clearly told Robert a total of 3 times throughout my repair process that I want my bumper because I'm putting it back on. It was a simple tear of the tab on the right side that was broken. The bumper aside from that was in perfect condition yet when I got it back it looked like that was what got hit. I've waited almost 4 months to give them a chance to right their wrong and all they've said is "we can't make your parts reappear." You did a great job at making them disappear though. I felt that this store only cared about the paycheck and not the customer. Guarantee that this is the last car any of my family members take there. I've notified aunts, cousins, uncles etc... They all saw what was left of my personal bumper and agreed that customer satisfaction meant nothing to these workers. I heard great things from this company only to feel my trust was violated and taken advantage of. I simply leave a review in hopes that anybody looking to trust this store rethink their decision and look for someone who cares for more than just your wallet.</Text>

<review>I wish there was a way to give no stars, firstly how can you deliver a car back to a customer with a new check engine light and car doesn't run properly. Another issue is lack of communication and doesn't call back, when you do get ahold of someone it's with constant excuses. I do not recommend, they put on after market parts that constantly go bad, paint job is trash and overall horrible experience</review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Great customer service and competent craftsmanship. We had work done on my son's "baby" - his Prius C. Great work! We couldn't have been treated better. We were kept informed of the work needed and timeline. Melissa and Robert are wonderful customer service representatives. I highly recommend this Caliber shop!< /text>

<Text>Absolutely terrible service and work. Save yourselves the headache and DO NOT go here. I brought in my brand new nissan sentra because it was completely vandalized. I had to go back and forth to this place a few times just to end up with swirls all over my car from them buffing my car. My insurance covered to have my car painted completely and many parts to be replaced but they never replaced parts and it looks as if they just tried buffing out the spray paint and key marks that were caused by whoever vandalized my car. The manager Kay specifically told me that my vehicle was not a "show room car" and would never be the same. Not happy and feel as if who I am and what I look like are the reason I was treated this way. I have attached a photo of what a year of service at this place has done to my brand new car.< /Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNZcSI3K6ey5zS4uJ4GGkTs4hyS6UrdMgumk23x=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< response>

<text>We take part in the Passport 2 History (look it up if you don't know about it) and three of the passport museums are within walking distance of each other in Santa Paula!  So my son and I took a day trip out to Santa Paula.  We visited all three museums starting with The California Oil Museum!

This FREE museum has a lot of stuff and has an excellent presentation!  What I liked best was that there are a ton of things for little kids to do... push buttons and stuff happens and what not.  There is a lot of cool antique gasolina here, signs, bulbs, etc.

You won't spend too-too much time here, but make this your first stop, park in the lot and make your way to the other museums as well.  A great day trip!< /text>< gmap_id>

Small museum full of history. Is was our very girls museum in California and it was a great experience. The staff introduced us to their museum passport. (Worth $5) The passport is a book full of museums around California. It includes information about each museum and it has a place for you to collect their stickers/stamps. This is something great to do with kids and get them eager to visit museums. Be sure to stamp a time card when you walk in and walk out of this museum. It makes a great reminder of your experience.</Text>

<text>A small museum with the wider story of oil in California. The exhibits are truly eclectic, but relevant. There's everything from real history and toys, to machinery and films. Then there's also the staff - absolutely brilliant. They care about the subject, they know a lot and they are keen to pass on the information. I'm very pleased that I took time out to visit.< /text></record>

Nice little museum, they have some displays aimed at kids. The full size oil drilling setup from the 1900's is impressive, it is in the side building be sure not to miss it. Unfortunately when I was here the back gallery was closed to set up a new exhibit and we did not get to see the second floor that is only by docent-led tour. This made the museum kinda small so if you can go when those parts are open.< /review>

Really loved it this place could be so much more if they had more donations and funding but very interesting to stop in real quick it's small enough to be in and out within 45 minutes and that's looking at everything</review>

<text>Really cool for anyone who likes history. A lot of pictures and artifacts that illustrate how different life was for the early adopters of Santa paula and the oil industry in general. Obviously biased to make the oil companies look good, but when you keep that in mind it's still a fun and educational place to go. It's fun and cheap enough where I would go back.

The museum is smaller and more unknown than other more famous museums in the southern california area.  But this museum does capture an important part of the California history which is often forgotten.  Oil.  Many people, including myself grow up not knowing how oil shaped southern California and continues to do so.  Worth visiting if you're local to the area.  They have big displays of some of the equipment used in the past.  There's free parking.</Review>

<text>Wow!

I was pleasantly surprised by this place. Their collard greens were a surprise because I have never had them before but they were so yummy. The candied yams are delicious and the catfish was delightful. I also had some gumbo for the first time, it was salty for my tasty but still really good. I would definitely recommend this place fir some quality Cajun food.</text><rate>5<//rate><resp>None< /resp>< user_id>

I ordered the Shrimp Po'Boy and I'll definitely order it again!  It was a lot bigger than I imagined but man was it tasty!  The bread was soft and crunchy.  They grilled the bread to perfection so the sandwich never got soggy.  The shrimp was cooked to perfection.  The sandwich came with lettuce, tomato, sliced pickles and a sauce that complimented all the flavors in perfect harmony!  I'd recommend this sandwich to EVERYBODY!!  It's hands down, on of the best sandwiches ever!</Review>

First time here. First impression, clean and friendly service. Good menu variety. Got the fish dinner with mac and collard greens. All delicious. Got some big pieces of fish too. Talked myself into getting the peach cobbler and I would do it again.<//review>

<review>I love these guys. I had catfish and grits for breakfast this morning. The breading isn't heavy, the fish is flaky. Got some gumbo to go and some Louisiana crunch cake. The real deal. Save the $700 plane ticket. Stay right here.</review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

We drove to Oxnard from Los Angeles  expressly to eat at the Cajun Country Cafe.  It was well worth the 2 hour drive.  Food is good, great choices,, portions are amazing, prices are unbelievable.   The staff is friendly, the owner Janet is the "hostess with the mostest"!  Space rather small but she is expanding into facility next door, outdoor dining is also available.< /review>

Got a shrimp po' boy and a side of hush puppies. I will  say the hush puppies were a little smaller than I thought they'd be but they were delicious! The real star of the show was that po' boy! Holy cow! The shrimp was fried perfectly, good flavor on the breading, roll was soft yet held up to the sauce and the sauce was very good. I'll definitely be coming back!<//text>

We had an amazing experience. Everyone who works there is super friendly and the food is second to none!!  The fried chicken was perfectly cooked and seasoned, the hush puppies were the best I’ve had and the peach cobbler had the perfect amount of sweetness.  5 stars plus 1!! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</review>

Food was delicious! Had the shrimp po’boy, mac + cheese, and the peach cobbler. The shrimp was seasoned super well and crispy yet tender. Mac and cheese was baked to perfection and the peach cobbler was satisfying without being overly sweet. The ambiance in the cafe was also really special; there was a warm family friendly environment that I enjoyed and the restaurant was clean with the cutest decor. There was also smooth jazz playing on the tv - how cool is that!? Overall great experience, I highly recommend eating here. The pandemic has affected so many small businesses, I hope the community rallies around this restaurant and helps support its success.<//Text>

<text>OMG!!!!! Their food is AMAZING!!! In these times when you want something actually "homemade" because Janet makes sure that happens, this is your cajun place. Everything is authentic and I am from the south sooo, not going to talk if it ain't good. Call in an order, too, pick it up and you will be the hit of everyone!< /text>< pics>

Glad I found this place. Had ribs, mac n cheese, greens and gumbo. This was NOT greens from a can nor was it mac n cheese from Smart N Final 😏. Everything was delish.<//Text>

<Review>Great & friendly service!
Their response to covid was handled really well where everything is clean and sanitized often and all food/drinks are served to you at the center of the lounge. No hot food is served but there's still a large variety of sandwiches and cold cuts and lots of snacks!
Would highly recommend visiting this lounge< /Review>< Pictures>

<Text>Very nice lounge! The women at the reception desk was very friendly and it only took a few minutes until we were in the lounge. Once inside the lounge is beautifully decorated. There are many seating options available and plenty of electrical outlets and desks if one needs to do work.  The media room is really nice, the wifi is fast and easy to connect to. There is a large variety of food, Refreshments and beverages (both alcoholic and non alcoholic). The staff is very friendly and helpful. They announce when flights are boarding and make sure travelers get to their flights on time.< /Text><date>1526272783781<//date></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Quite a nice lounge. The seats were comfy, lots of plug sockets, and a good selection of food and drink. The beers were particularly good. My only criticism and something to be aware of is that they don't allow Lounge Club cardholders in during busy times. We had to wait 45 mins until it got less busy before we were let in.</Text><Time>1561676242088<//Time><username>Max Lawson< /username>< Gmap_id>

<Review>This lounge really is the basics apart from the French wine selection - get those Bordeaux’s into me 😍 nevertheless, it’s a little diminished by having to drink fine wine from a standard glass and the food is sub-par, nothing hot, just finger food. Friendly staff and fairly quiet compared to its cathay counterpart</Review>< pictures>

Just okay. Very quiet at night which was a welcomed respite. Despite closing at 1215am, they warmly welcomed guests in until almost the last minute to have a drink or use the facilities. But beyond that, food could be improved as could seating. A good selection of local San Francisco beers.< /Text>

Tldr; Good variety of food, Good WiFi, but Crammed space!

Quite a decent lounge, and quite busy too! I used my priority pass to gain access and was in around around 7:30/8pm. Almost every seat was occupied! You see a bunch of seats and a coffee bar when you enter, but you should venture out behind that. There's a proper mini-buffet back there and some tables to sit at too. In terms of the food, there was spaghetti and meatballs, chicken noodle soup, a couple types of sandwiches (they looked really good!), cheese and cold cuts, and a salad bar. They also have had toasted vegetables and teriyaki chicken! There was also an open bar, with quite a few options and some bar snacks like pretzels, banana chips and dried fruits). I only had simple salad with some of that really good balsamic vinaigrette!

One downside is that the place seemed really crammed because all the tables and seats were fairly close to each other. The food area was also quite small and all stuffed up in one corner.
The seating area at the entrance (in front of the coffee bar) was pretty much empty, probably because everyone was getting food and sitting by the tables.< /Text>

< review>
I accessed the Lounge through my Priority Pass card and the check in was quite smooth. The lounge area itself is spacious and has ample seating arrangement. Their beverage station was well stocked and easily accessible. The staff is pleasent as well. However, the lounge shuts at 11:15 PM, which seems unjust for a passenger/patron not travelling on their consortium flight but rather a member of another programme. The entire airport is shut down around that time and there's no place for a red-eye traveller to rest of grab a bite. My second biggest issue was with the wasted of food. As responsible world citizens we should strive to use the available resources judiciously I felt. Instead of dumping pots full of food in trash the same could be distributed among the needy and underprivileged in the vicinity of the airport. The aforementioned is only a suggestion. I might rethink before visiting again though.< /review>

<text>Plenty of seats always. With priority pass, they already started limiting the hours you can use it but then they start limiting even more hours “based on demand”. The app says that people can use the lounge at 8:30 but the representatives told us we have to wait until 10:30 for priority pass, even though the lounge was not even that busy. Then when 10:30 came around, there was a line of about 20 people using priority pass and not only that, they took away the food before 10:45... I barely got inside, got one plate of food as they were trying to take it away and then got told to leave at 11:10...

If you’re going to participate, make it a little better than that...</text>< username>

The lady announced the last call at 23:15 when I just arrived the lounge. And few minutes after I collected the food,  this waitress wanted to collect everything on my table when I was just about to start. How does this make sense? And the opening hour lasts until 23:45 btw.

Update: they forced me putting food into a plastic cup so that they can collect the plates. This is hilarious, made my day.< /review>

<text>Ok for a lounge. Too crowded with minimal amenities such as ok food. Sandwiches, soggy pasta, lots of bread, salad was good.

Beers and soft drinks rocked.

Way too many people. First or Business class were given priority over mileage priority club. However, did not feel special.

Staff is luke warm compared to other friendly first class services.

Everyone seemed tired.

Pays to have business class tickets.< /text><GmapID>0x808f779765a6424d:0x13073419f991a647< /GmapID><user_name>Arnold Flores< /user_name>< Pictures>

One of the most mediocre lounges. Small space that feels cramped. Food is ok if you want bar food and white pasta.<//Review>

Very nice and attentive staff working in different positions at this lounge. Good selection of foods and drinks, despite this lounge appears very popular, and the sitting layout is quite compact.< /text>

Nice place for you to have a rest for next flight
They offers hot dishes, sandwiches, salad, wine, beer, deesert, etc. Free wifi and magazines.

I stay there for an hour from 10:30pm and staff keep refilling food. Priority pass accepted here.< /review>

<review>A bit of small.lounge...the food and drinks are okay bit service does not include support with changing flights et al.

It is a bit cramped but the wifi is good.

Okay place to rest for a few hours...however given how big SFO is, Air France should have a bigger lounge here</review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNVDM_RXcE-KmSDr-dPQ1SsV1vTWYCu7jc7aVeU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPzRxeXoJMrZjpPYxOc96ZEoU3l1n139XWPo2D8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< Resp>

It's a good lounge with decent food (cold sandwiches, soup and salad) and drinks. I like that the liquors are self-served.

But it's difficult to access this lounge as you have to fly out from International terminal concourse A to be allowed in.</text>

<Date>1558555271223</Date><rating>4< /rating><review>It was better than I expected after reading the online reviews. It's a modest lounge that can't compare with QANTAS or Cathay, but it is clean and well run. There was a reasonable selection of alcohol and food - I had a glass of champagne to wash down the yummy meatballs with roasted vegetables. The staff were generally friendly and helpful. The food was topped up regularly and our table was cleared quickly and frequently. Not my favourite airport lounge but much better than nothing.< /review>< pictures>

The AF lounge can be accessed after going through the international terminal in SFO by entering on the left after being cleared

It initially looks smaller but there is an additional area behind the coffee machine with a great view of the gates. The food and drinks are good although compared to most lounges a bit outdated and less to choose from.

Overall it's a good lounge to relax before a flight although there is a huge shortage in restrooms for the amount of people they host</review>

<text>This was the first lounge my wife and I tried with the Priority Passes we got from our Chase Reserve card. The lounge is pretty quiet and provides a good selection of complimentary food and drinks. WiFi speed is good. Seems to be pretty busy and they monitor how many people are already in the lounge as to not overcrowd it. Power outlets are located on the stool seating areas. The lounge was a welcome reprieve from waiting in the loud public terminals with limited seating and outlets next to the gates.</text>< pictures>

Decent lounge with good food and wine. A bit dated, small and no showers (a bummer if you have no lounge upon arrival to freshen up for a business trip). 4/5 stars because competitive lounges offer more premium amenities, more intimate and useful spaces and a generally more relaxing atmosphere.<//Review>

Nice assortment of nibbles that get better farther back you go (there are 3 sections) one of the cleanest lounges I've been in. Wait/clean staff was super on top of picking up plates and glasses without being intrusive. Front desk walked around to notify people of fight changes rather than using a PA, very pleasant.<//review>< pics>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>Excellent lounge. I was able to gain access through priority pass. Highly recommended. The receptionists were very friendly and accomodating with excellent communicating skill. They explained to me that the lounge was at capacity and advised me to come back a little later. I did and was admitted without any question. The lounge offers many complimentary beverages, wines, drinks, variety of teas, and freshly prepared food. The cookies are so yummy; they are warm, crunchy on the outside and soft inside, and fresh from the oven. I would recommend paying this lounge a visit. I assure you it will not disappoint.<//Text>< pics>

<Review>Far from my expectations. Very short selection of food and drinks. Personnel is kind and attentive. Space isn't small but it feels a little crowded. The coffee machine will only give you espresso and cappuccino. I sort of expected more variety for an exclusive lounge in San Francisco. After all, it's one of the main destinations in the USA.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

Clean, efficient friendly services. Food OK, liked fresh fruits and salad. I don't drink but see a variety of bottles on open bar. Many families so not a calm quiet lounge with kids and cell phone dinging during peak times. Found out the constant cell phone dings were one of the front service personnel whom claims needing the notifications for service (every 5 - 30 sec?)<//Text>

<Rating>3<//Rating><text>It's clean and bright with panoramic view of the runways. but on the small side. Not many people here on a early sat morning 1 week before Thanksgiving. Nothing really special. Very much an average type lounge. For breakfast they had good quality croissants, fruit etc.<//text>< pictures>

Staff were lovely and attentive to restock and clear plates, food was nice (meatball pasta, ham and cheese baguettes, chessboard, tortillas with dip, fruit, bread, brownies, chicken soup), not much choice in soft drinks (Coke and Sprite), lots of choice of tea, lots of alcohol, wifi was fast and toilets could be cleaner but were okay. Seats were not particularly comfortable. Easy to find!<//review>

A barely better than average lounge. Food options could be fresher and of a higher standard. Seating needs to be more plentiful spaced out. Be sure to get their early if you intend to get some space for a group of travelers. Only saving grace is that there are plenty of power points on the bench that runs along the windows. Decor needs a makeover too.</Text>

<Text>Shared with KLM and Korean Air, the Air France Lounge makes for a relatively small lounge with limited food and drink options and no showers. It's also a Priority Pass lounge so I'm sure it can get pretty packed with people on busy hours. Hopefully  the new SFO expansion and renovation will make way for bigger and better lounges in the future.</Text><pics>None< /pics><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

As far as lounges go, this one was nice. Ample room to stretch out and charge devices, and a reasonable spread of food and snacks. The food quality was decent, about what I expected. I was surprised by the alcohol selection which included middle shelf liquor as well as wine. The staff was very friendly, and we had no problems bringing our pets or using our premier pass for entry.<//Review>

The lounge includes two buffets, one large one and one small one. The smaller buffet contains the cold items available in the larger buffet, but no hot food. The breakfast spread at the smaller buffet included fruit, bread, yogurt, cheese, cold cuts, and cereals.</Review>

I just completed a trip around the world for 8 months, and have been to numerous (better) lounges.  I  have never been turned away with my Priority Pass.  The woman at the desk said they were at capacity but then 13 people left and she let 3 people in past me.  Then told me they were holding space in the lounge for only for executive passengers and that I could try back in 3 hours.  Seriously.<//text>

<text>Nothing French here, Chinese running this place and all it has is meat items. Therefore the selection is terrible. Most lounges have something that is s main course off the "let's clog your arteries" track. Not here they are on the unhealthy meat train all the way. Forks Over Knives on Netflicks has doctors from the Cleveland Clinic warning about eating meat. Yet still places like this one try to shove it in your face.< /text></record>

<Review>It's very easy to find this lounge in sfo.
Lounge is decent with sitting space and a room.
Food is also decent. If you are indian, this lounge offers u some sort of relief for ur taste buds. U won't find any Indian food but u can enjoy similar taste here for some dishes.
They have decent alcohol collection, including JD , blue label, black label , red label and 6-8 wines types , vodka etc.

Overall not a bad lounge.</Review>< pics>

In A Nutshell:

-The Air France/KLM Lounge is hard to get into b/c you have to fly out of Concourse A.
-Finally, after multiple trips all over the place, my wife and I were blessed to have access to this Priority Pass lounge before flying out to Central/South America.
-SFO is a hot mess right now w/ all the construction happening & since it's a very popular/busy airport, having some kind of escape from the terminal is always nice.
-This lounge is divided into 2 sections: front and back.
-You have all the necessary ingredients for a pleasant stay (plenty of seats, WiFi, food, drinks, alcohol).

Overall, the Air France/KLM Lounge is a better than average lounge.< /text>

The Air France lounge has much of what you would wish for from the French: good wine, charcuterie and cheese. However it can be a little crowded because it's not quite big enough to hold the traffic for both Air France and their partner KLM. Helpful staff and, of course, better Wi-Fi than the rest of the airport.<//Review>

<Text>It is in the SFO airport. When you will enter after immigration and security check in, it will be on your left side. Nice sitting arrangement in between two halls. Food is also good there. But you can't expect variety, obviously !☺</Text><gmapID>0x808f779765a6424d:0x13073419f991a647< /gmapID>< user_id>

Got in with no issues with my wife, no wait list luckily/surprisingly.  But the lounge was nearly full and we settled on some high top seats which were convenient areas for power outlets.  People seated in the regular chairs had to get up and share with our outlets.  Overheard an older couple complimenting how comfy the seats were in the tech museum room, I really wanted to try them out but didn't get the chance.  We had some cheese and meatballs during our stay - not bad.  Chocolate chip cookies were good.  Help yourself beer and liquor!  Bathrooms were acceptably clean.  Staff was always on the ball, and super friendly.</review>

<Text>Very nice lounge with very nice choice of food.  Liquor and wine and beer on self service. Food is really good. Seating is comfortable and staff is very polite. There was a choice is salad, with veggies, pasta, sandwiches and dessert. They offer water from dispensing machine either cold, sparkling or room temperature. The lounge by itself is small and might not be able to accommodate you if there is rush hour. Fhere are smaller room with french tech  in the silicon valley expo. They are showing what these company do. This lounge compares to European lounges or Asian lounges. Way better than united lounge.< /Text></record>

We called in on our way back from SFO to LGW but it was noisy & packed out with kids screaming, so we looked at each other and asked if it was worth the voucher and decided it definitely wasn’t.
Another factor was our flight was due to be at 18:30, and they have some strange opening hours, so as we knew which gate we were to be flying from we ventured to the gate via a sandwich and it was quieter and near a flight boards.</review>

Food was okay. Tasted good but you could tell it was your traditionally stereotypical airport food. There was also no bartender like you would find at SJC, as an example. For what it is worth, the food is pretty good compared to SJC. Front desk was nice. The front entrance is a bit confusing. There is 6 options for lounges, and the sign to the lounges just past security aren't obvious for my bat-like self. Some "turnaround you missed it" signs would be nice. The wine was decent, but it wasn't stocked well in terms of quantity.<//Review>

Great place to hang out until your flight. Quiet and convenient, with tables and wifi, a great place to relax, take a nap, or grab a bite. Got to use it via my Priority Pass Select membership, and it definitely makes late flights less stressful. Only thing to get stressed about is forgetting your flight and falling asleep ...< /Text>

The lounge was ordinary nothing to be called to business level status. On the contrary when asked if anything vegetarian sandwich can be prepared by chef since everything on buffet has meat in some shape or form was bluntly refused.  So be mindful of you vegetarian  as French still trying to figure out what that means. Buffet was ordinary and spirits and beer collection was limited and lounge was filling in for too many other brands including lounge club which made little lounge too crowded. I gave them 2 star. It's hard to get an experience  in a lounge when focus was moved from customer experience to dollar cutting. Lounges are very few establishment left where we expect the luxury  which was completely missing. I hope they pickup their game before AA start losing revenue and customer loyalty.<//Review>

The check in was easy.. conveninently located near security checkpoint.. the food and coffee are great.  Staffs are attentive.. ample space for everyone to spread out across.  I enjpyed it.. it almost felt like I was at a different airport,  compared to how busy SFO generally is.</review>

Staff was friendly. Food options fairly limited especially when compared to other airline lounges. That said, it's a decent place to escape the crowds at the airport. WiFi was slow but worked. Clean restrooms as well.< /text>

Lounge was quiet and had a number of drinks to choose from. The food selection is typical lounge food...light snacks. There is free WiFi available. If you are a priority pass member you can access this lounge even if your flight isn't from the international terminal, you just need your valid boarding pass to clear security.</text>

<resp>None< /resp><Text>Would give zero if possible. If you are planning to get here for food etc before catching your flight, don't do it. I reached early and they didn't allow me in. They didn't even allow me to sit near the reception area. "It's too full" while I could literally see it was at least half empty. There was no one in the chairs near the reception and yet they said "we need these chairs".  One lady rudely interrupted
"check our website it says restricted timing"  yeah right that's what I will do while traveling long distance flights. Don't go to this place.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><Gmap_id>0x808f779765a6424d:0x13073419f991a647</Gmap_id>< userid>

They had a pretty good food selection at this lounge. Also had a bunch of wine and champagne. Was peak time and still able to get a seat. Only downside was that there was construction going on outside which made the view not the greatest.</text>

<Review>Since this is a shared Air France/KLM lounge, perhaps it was not French turn today :) The food was worse than mediocre - I could not find any appetizing to choose from.

<review>Really nice lounge. Free bar with multiple beers and wines, and different spirits of your choosing. Good food though not as extensive a selection as some, certainly a step up from your standard fare. Eating area is a bit hidden in a back room. There is also a business room.<//review><rating>5<//rating>< name>

<text>The Air France/KLM lounge on San Franciso is located in the Internationsl terminal. It has a small Silent room, a larger area with confortable chairs and some bites/coffe/drinks and another area with tables and chairs with a buffet.

The buffet has both warm and cold dishes and both alcohol free as well as alcoholic drinks.

The buffet is continuously being refilled and extended.

Great place to wait for your plane's departure!< /text><pics>None</pics><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x808f779765a6424d:0x13073419f991a647< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Nice lounge, with simple food offerings that are good enough.  The staff is nice.

The WiFi here is terrible and continues to cut out and disconnect every 5-10 minutes.

There are no showers.</Review>

So cool to be able to get in here with a friend's travel card. We got some free breakfast and a few beers while killing about 2 hours before our flight. The service was really good and they were regularly coming around to clean off the tables. Plenty of wall outlets if you need to charge up before getting on your flight.</review>

When it's crowded, they sometimes reject or delay people who use priority pass. Otherwise it's a good regular airport lounge.< /Text>

Great selections of alcoholic drinks. There are wines and snacks in every rooms of the lounge. It's self-served, but can't argue when it's unlimited. Appetizers are good as well. Food selection is limited and not that great. I still don't know why they have fried rice in this lounge.</review>

I was here from about 2030 to 2220.  There were three areas to sit in.  The initial room you walk into has stools along the window overlooking the apron, with some regular chairs (adequately comfortable).  There was a coffee machine and snacks to partake of. Off this area was a small room that had a couple of more plush couches and seats, and the men's and women's restrooms.  Continuing through to the rear brings you to the dining room, where you can find a more comprehensive selection of wines and spirits, salads, snacks, and sandwiches, and soup. There was hot food when I arrived but this may just be for dinner based on some other reviews.  The dishes cycled, it was rice and meatballs when I arrived and changed to rice, chicken wings, grilled vege and dim sums before I left. You will find stools along the window, tables for dining, and a few more chairs in the corner.  Overall I was happy with the food and drink selection and the staff were friendly.< /text>

<review>I finally had a chance to stop by the KLM lounge prior to my flight. It's located to the left after TSA in the international terminal.

After entering I was kindly greeted by staff.  She was friendly and courteous.

Lounge amenities include complimentary snacks and food, alcoholic beverages, Wi-Fi, newspaper and magazines, printers, and departure delay info.  On the morning during my visit. They had hot breakfast and Greek yogurt with toppings.

They do not make any departure announcements so plan your time accordingly.

Overall not a bad lounge to hang out at prior to your flight.</review>< Pictures>

<text>Had a 6hr layover at SFO. I had to left concourse F, go through security to concourse a to get to KLM lounge. SFO should have had tram or other ways to connect different concourse so passengers do not have to go through security repetitively. The lounge has two sections.  Here provides coffee, snacks, liquor, various pastries, fruits, soup, and cup ramen.< /text>< userid>

It's small, but I like it more than the Cathay Pacific lounge. The penne and meatballs is always nice.< /review>

Not a particularly large lounge & definitely not enough seating for the never ending processions of people coming & going.  Was cramped & seats were uncomfortable. Food was in hot boxes so was semi warm. Some good some not so. Not a great variety from which to choose ditto the wines. Big let down was no showers & only three cubicles in the ladies< /Text>< pictures>

<Text>Decent lounge. Not as bad as many reviews make it sound (notice most 1 star reviews are just people with priority pass complaining they didn’t have access). A bit crowded but decent selection of food and self-pour drinks. Extremely kind staff.<//Text>< Name>

Very small lounge. Lots of people around noon. Noisy. Children. There is an extra room in the back, but it doesn't makes things much better. It's almost as crowded as the terminal gates. Coffee machine produced bad coffee, was slow and had a line. Snacks itself was not terrible.</text>

Cramped space. Overcrowded, and no air conditioning. Food was average (for a US fast food takeaway). Wine was good (one needs to ask for bottles to be replaced), as were the whiskeys. Coffee machine produced a decent brew (after getting the attendant to fill the water tank/replenish coffee beans/etc).
I am amazed that Air France/KLM would lend their name to this lounge.</Text>

The lounge is smallish but very pleasent. I think AF/KLM and Priority pass need to sort out the accessibility of this longe by PP members. The reception staff kept dissing PP while checking us in...< /text>

Way too small for the crowd. As a result, too noisy. I already had lunch so did not look in detail at what was available, but it didn't look much. The staff was helpful, but for example when the delay was announced they did not inform the (small) room, just people who inquired. The staff was however nice, and did help inform people when boarding started.
Most of the noise was due to impolite people, from those shouting into their phones to those watching some video on their tablet with the volume up. If you plan to get to the lounge to take a nap, forget it.<//text>

I loved the cereal/granola/yoghurt bar with fresh raspberries and blueberries out of season - impressive. The rest of the food choices were okay, not spectacular....tater tots were an interesting inclusion. WiFi was weak in the back, and I couldn't get cellular data, so stay in the front of the lounge if you need to be online.< /Review>

Small front section with coffee and beer, even smaller "eating area" with salads sandwich soup and pasta for lunch and dinner.  My espresso cup was chipped and the signs didn't always match the food.  There were plenty of outlets for the number of chairs, but only on the high top bar not through out the serting area .< /Text>< Pictures>

If you have traveled around the world in last few years and used any other lounge you would know why I m so upset. Classic example of bad as hospitality and usually over crowded lounge. Most of the food items they serve are out of a Costco box, literally no vegetarian edible items. I hope priority pass had some basic criterion.<//review>

Priority Pass gets you access, but that means you are also fighting a crowd of people at all times of day (note that they restrict access at certain times). Food selection is passable. It's better to sit in the rear of the lounge as the view is better, but you'll never find much peace in here. Staff are friendly and do their best, but they probably get easily overwhelmed by the constant stream of passengers.<//review>

Two stars at best. Stark simple and clearly in expensive for qantas. Just not the standard a business class traveler requires in an airport with few facilities . Frankly I thought I was back in the high school cafeteria. Alcohol for those that wanted it but little for those that didn't. Poor show qantas<//review>

Solid lounge. They always have lots of food and drinks available, and not just nuts and fruits either, they'll have stuff like waffles and sausage in the morning and sandwiches and soup in the afternoon.  Also a dessert and coffee bar.
I've never seen it super crowded although have been turned away as a priority pass holder, it wasn't clear if they had designated hours for that or if they just turn away pp members when it's too crowded.</review>

<text>I had a very bad experience with this lounge, not the first time that I did not write any review that they closed early prior more than 1 hour of my flight and I was told I can get in for 10 min.  This time, I came in at 10: 30am and I was told I needed to be back at 11:30am that was my boarding time.  The website info says it is not busy and they just don’t let me get in.  I will not participate this lounge access.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< GmapID>

<text>Air France KLM lounge is a partner with Qantas and is a great place to rest when in San Francisco while you wait for your flight. Inside the lounge are hot meals and cold meals including different kinds of alcohol, drinks, such as coffee and fruits and desserts. There are also toilets too. The only downside is that it is not big and can get really crowded when there are a lot of people in there.<//text><Resp>None<//Resp><date>1511404062008<//date><Pics>None<//Pics></record></dataset><record>

Quiet and clean. The food is pretty low key and I found the lack of any warm food a bit disappointing. No eggs, no toast, no bagels. Basically, none of the usual breakfast items. Clean bathrooms. So yeah, 2.5-3 stars.< /text>

There was a event happening in the lounge and i could barely find a chair to sit on which is less comfortable than seats around gates. Crowded, noisy, no internet (due to congestion). I just wanted to take some rest and I regret i didn't go out right after seeing this happening.
(Update 2 weeks later) this place became a lot nicer without event happening<//review>< pictures>

<Review>Decent variety of food with great view of the airport and ocean. The food is replenish frequently.

The bad thing is that this lounge is located in the international concourse A (there are 2 international concourses at SFO) and this one doesn't connect to any other concourses which means you will need to go through additional security check if you do not have a flight in this concourse (which happened to be our case). Unless you are flying out of concourse A (minority of gates), getting here would probably be a huge hassle hence I couldn't give them more than 3 stars.

There are 3 seating areas:
A) open area with chairs when you first walk in - with coffee machines and snacks
B) Room with sofa - no food offering
C) Dining room tuck away at the back - with more food, and larger selection of beverages< /Review><Rating>3< /Rating></record></dataset><record>

<user_id>101314333720627069715< /user_id><review>Lounge is just outside the security and TSA check at terminal A. The front office staff was friendly and I use my priority pass membership to get in
The front section of the lounge is quite small and can seat about 30 people, but the seats are arranged very close to each other
There's a snack counter, and behind that there is another lounge section with much more seating.
The lounge is crowded around the time of an Air France or KLM flight departure, but otherwise it is sparsely populated .
Good Wi-Fi connectivity and overall a good lounge to be at for an hour or two<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures></record></dataset><record>

<date>1522972870927< /date><Review>First time in this lounge. Was very pleasant and clean.The staff were friendly and helpful. Whilst waiting for flight, enjoyed a variety of hot savoury and balanced choice of fayre. There was a good selection of alcoholic beverages for the discerning traveller. Also available were juices, fizzy drinks and coffees with an accompanient of cakes to enjoy. The atmosphere was peaceful and relaxed and only interuppted by the dilligent staff regularly clearing tables and refreshing the fayre provided.< /Review><gmapID>0x808f779765a6424d:0x13073419f991a647</gmapID><Rate>4<//Rate>< Response>

<Text>Food and Beverage was on point, as you would expect from an Air France lounge. Serious lack of lounge type seating, mostly just table type settings and bar stools looking out over the runways. Views are great and during off times it's pretty empty. As my gripe with all lounges, this one could use some soft background music to keep it from feeling so stale. Not the best lounge in the world, but you could do worse.<//Text>< Response>

<Rating>2< /Rating><Text>Really disappointed with this place. I wouldn't call it a business lounge.

I'm traveling with Qantas and despite being close to the British Airways and Cathay Pacific lounges, the only option we have as J class ticket holder is this substandard "business" lounge.

QF74 being just after an Air France flight to Paris makes the lounge overcrowded. No showers.

The food options are very limited and disappointing. They provide USB charging but *no option to charge laptops*.

The staff I spoke to was very friendly - that's the only positive thing I have to say about this place.< /Text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

< Review>
One of the worst lounges you get flying with Qantas. If you are lucky you might get Cathay access instead but apparently limited to first 10 Qantas frequent flyers thru door. Better to go hangout at the bar vs air France lounge in my opinion.< /Review>

< Review>
If you are a Priority Pass holder, don't expect that you'll actually be able to use this lounge, as they can close access if it's busy. Otherwise it's a mediocre, small space with basic snacks and drinks. Below standards for an international business class lounge, especially at an airport like SFO.</Review>

BASIC.

Air France/KLM was my first airport lounge experience and I was very underwhelmed. I only got to hang out for a half an hour that night because they decided to close earlier than their listed time. Luckily, they still had some wine, liquor, and beer left that you could help yourself too. They also had a buffet area but who knows how long the food had been sitting out and how many people had touched it. I was not about to get any sort of food poisoning for my 6 hour flight back to NYC.

For Priority Pass holders, this is the only lounge in the SFO International terminal that you have access to. It's nice to get away from the crowds but it's also a bit old and musty in there. This is a classic example of an "I'll take what I can get" situation.< /Text>

< review>
An older, French woman working at the front desk was incredibly unhelpful. Impatient and horribly rude, answering before I'm even half way through my sentence, she seemed to hate her job. I was told they are just taking priority select customers then they have capacity (as if it's out if altruism), which in this case meant misinforming me twice on when I could enter. I waited for 30mins and in the end left in frustration.  Horrible experience.< /review>

Really basic.  Terrible zombies for service people.  If you access to other lounges, go there. They do not make flight announcements, inoperable machines (coffee, water, etc). Two stars only because they do have full (self service) bar.<//Text>

One of the worst lounges on the network which is challenging given the general low quality lounges AFKLM have in general. The general concourse is only marginally less appealing!<//text>

I feel somewhere sophisticated.

Shower: none
Beverage: Beer, wine, liquor, soft drinks, hot drinks
Food: Snack, Cap noodle, Light meal, sandwiches, salads, fruit, dessert

(Translated by Google) If you come in with money, you will definitely regret it. However, those who come for free, such as Diners Card, do not manage to be bad. The front desk staff was not unkind. The food was ... I was very hungry and satisfied. Diners cards have a limited time to enter, so be sure to check beforehand. For reference, it is possible from 8 pm to 11:45 pm. Check out the rest of the time.

쌩돈을 내고 들어오신다면 분명 후회합니다. 하지만 다이너스카드 등 공짜로 들어오시는 분들은 그럭저럭 나쁘진 않습니다. 프론트 직원들이 불친절하지는 않았습니다. 음식은... 저는 배가 너무 고파서 만족스러웠습니다. 다이너스 카드는 들어올 수 있는 시간이 딱 정해져 있으니 반드시 사전에 체크하시길. 참고로 오후 8시부터 오후 11시 45분까지 가능. 그 외 시간은 직접 체크해보시길.<//text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Very small living room with little natural light. We feel crammed. The supply of food and drinks is very limited, like other US salons (mini sandwiches and "salad bar"). Note that you will have to serve with plates the size of a dinette forcing you to return several times to the buffet .. The place is clearly not pleasant, if we note a positive point, the wifi is working properly. Air France can do better, especially on this type of destination.

I must say that the cleaning staff was super cool and they helped me fix my broken bag. And everything was impeccable. Only for them go my two stars.

Nisshin cup noodles and other hot dishes and salads, fruits and nuts, coffee, instantly made carbonated water and drinks. Immediately after passing through the Immigration Security Examiner. Korean Air Business Ideal, SkyTeam Elite Plus, PP Card, Diners Card available.

(Translated by Google) The place is very beautiful, they offer different very rich snacks and also different drinks, whether they are alcoholic or non-alcoholic. It has very comfortable spaces and wi-fi is high speed. It has an independent space where one can relax and wait for your flight in a comfortable and relaxing way. The only problem is that is at the beginning of the rooms to address.

Meals are pasta, meatballs, bread, soup, etc., which does not go to the restaurant, but it is enough to satisfy your hunger. It's a bit disappointing that there aren't many desks in the dining space, but if you think of it as a snack, it might be reasonable.
Location is good with the entrance on the left side of the security checkpoint at Gate A of Terminal 1.
Of course Wifi is free, but there was only a part of the space that can be charged.
If you have a Priority Pass, you can enter the room, so I recommend that you use it.

手前にリラックススペース、奥に食事スペースがあります。食事はパスタ、ミートボール、パン、スープなどで、レストランとまでは行きませんが、空腹を、満たすには十分な内容です。食事スペースでは、机が少ないのが若干残念ではありますが、軽食用と思えば、妥当かもしれません。
ターミナル1のゲートAで、セキュリティチェックポイントを出たすぐ左側に入り口があり、立地は良好。
Wifiはらもちろんフリーですが、充電出来るスペースは、一部でした。

(Translated by Google) I found the service very bad. A lack of respect from the staff. If the closing time is at 11:15 PM until that time they must provide services. Since 10:30 PM there was no coffee and tea service. The staff began to withdraw meals half an hour before closing. On repeated occasions they said they were about to close. The correct thing would be that cleaning and removal of groceries do so after the closing time. On the other hand there were very few chairs available for resting. I do not recommend this Lounge.

(Original)
Me pareció muy malo el servicio.Una falta de respeto de parte del personal. Si el horario de cierre es a la 11.15 PM hasta esa hora deben prestar servicios. Desde las 10.30 PM ya no había servicio de café y té. El personal comenzó a retirar las comidas media hora antes del cierre. En repetidas oportunidades decían que estaban por cerrar. Lo correcto sería que la limpieza y retiro de los comestibles lo hagan después de la hora de cierre. Por otra parte había muy pocas sillas disponibles para descansar. No recomiendo este Lounge.</Text>
