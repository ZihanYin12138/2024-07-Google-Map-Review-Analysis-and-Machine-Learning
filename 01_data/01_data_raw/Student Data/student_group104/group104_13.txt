<Pictures>None</Pictures><review>Rosa gave me an impeccable hair cut. She suggested me the right side length from a catalog of pictures. She was very gentle with my hair, had a lot of patience and did not rush. At the end of she used a hand mirror to show me the back of my head and confirmed if everything was to my satisfaction- it was perfect. Then she gave my hair a proper shampoo followed by a blow dry and styling. All this for less than $20 is a total value for money. Highly recommend for a men's haircut.</review><gmap_id>0x808fc9558d2d6ebf:0xdb1fe936ef86ae3a<//gmap_id><date>1616358663284</date>< name>

Very good. Sanitize everything. Nice and helpful employees.
Wasn't quite satisfied with my haircut at first, so came back right after, and they fixed it for me! Paid 28.98 for woman haircut and also added $8 tip. Very happy with everything.
Unfortunately, don't do hair bleaching during the quarantine.<//review>

Got the groupon to save a few bucks and made an appointment. I was going to be 7 minutes late and so I called to let them know. They said that is fine just come. I get there and have to check in on the iPad and no one greets me while I'm checking in. Then I wait in front for about 16 more minutes and then they said it will be another 20 minutes. Really??? Said I was late, but I called ahead and you told me to come. That would make it 45 mins past my appointment time. I suggest trying another spot. Not friendly service here. I'll take my business to people to need it.

Update: With the level of service I received I will not return back. Very unprofessional.<//Text>

Amazing!! I found them on yelp and I took my mom to get her hair done. She got a hair cut, dyed and styled. I got my nails done, just changed my color.
Staff was super friendly from answering my phone call today in the morning to make an appointment (wanted to make sure my mom had ample time for her hair services) and throughout our visit, staff was attentive and professional. Great prices! QUALITY work and both my mom and I are satisfied customers! We also like their check in process, so they are taking covid precautions. We will return in the future.< /Text>

I bought a Groupon for a mini facial and gel manicure. Ly did both services and was super sweet and attentive to my nails and facial. It was a great experience for an amazingly good price. They charged me $5 to take off the gel that I had previously had on but it wasn't a big deal (I was told when Ly was taking it off so I appreciated the heads up). I'm very happy with my nails and I'll definitely come back again!</Review>

<Text>Nice hair salon located in a busy plaza right next to Grocery Outlet.  I got a haircut by the gentleman that works here.  I forgot his name.  He was really good and took his time to make sure I was satisfied with the haircut I received.  I was really happy with the end results!  Prices are really affordable.  $20 for a woman's haircut and $12 for a men's haircut.  I would defiantly return for another hair cut.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>{'time': 1558681562615, 'text': 'Thank you so much!

Fun course! Pro shop guys were awesome! They let me demo this auto caddy cart thing for free!
The restaurant was delicious! Bartender made the perfect margaritas, and we're picky about our margs.
We will definitely be back!</Text>

< review>
A fun place. Good location (stay left at the  first sign otherwise you head into the park) with easy parking. Great food and service (probably best to stick with the beer and wine). The Toptracer tech isn't top notch and needs improvement. On the whole, a very nice place to swing your clubs.< /review>

<review>This place is awesome,  I was looking on line for a last second 9 hole to play,  I called Dairy Creek Golf Course the person who answered the phone was extremely accommodating, got a early tee time. I showed up, paid and off I went. The view is awesome the greens are perfect, almost liked like velvet 😋,  I shot 9 over the par on the front 9. I wished I could have played the back nine, next time I will.</review>< response>

<text>Dairy is a great place to play 9 holes. The course is well maintained, and the driving range is the best in the area. The large putting practice area is nice too.

The new golf carts they introduced recently are fancy, but limit where you can drive. If you venture off the cart path to track down your ball, it will limit the speed to nearly 0, making the carts more of a hassle than convenience.

As someone who works 9-5 during the week, its frustrating that the staff forces you off the course at 7PM sharp. I’ve been on the 8th tee box at 6:45 and been told by staff that I have to leave. A frustrating experience, especially after paying $50 for me and my guest to play a quick round.

To make the experience more frustrating, is the fact that I’ve never seen a Marshall regulating the speed of play. We got stuck behind a “Single" that in fact had his wife and toddler with him. They were using their slot as golf lessons. Not a great group to follow when trying to complete 9 holes before the 7pm curfew.

Hopefully Dairy Creek’s management will act on the customer feedback and extend their operating hours. It would be great to utilize the extra hour and a half of sunlight that goes unused each day.</text>< Pictures>

<resp>{'time': 1595895230408, 'text': 'Mr. Hoover, thanks for the feedback, insight, and suggestions. In addition to gps, electronic scorecards, and messaging systems, the new golf cars have a technology to help us monitor the golf cars and assist in the golfer experience. Yes they do slow down in areas in the roughs where the terrain gets steep or bumpy. This is to provide a more smooth ride for the golfer and to protect the front suspension of the golf cars so that we can limit our expenses, therefore keepIng our green fees low. The cars do slow down to 8 mph in these areas vs the standard 12 mph. If golf cars enter green complexes or tee box areas then the cars do slow to 2 mph or completely stop in some circumstances. These are highly prized areas of golf real estate and golf car traffic can do significant damage to these areas. We are trying to discourage golf car traffic in these areas to provide the best playing conditions and value to our customers. This may add a few steps to your round and for that we ask your understanding for the greater benefit of everyone. Finally, our mission at Dairy Creek is to grow the game and attract new customers. We welcome families, young people, and “newbies” to to play our course. The golf course is a great place to teach the game especially at the end of the day when traffic is light. We do everything in our power to notify the golfers that we close at 7 pm. Our website, voice service, email blasts, and staff profess these hours of operation. The early closure is to protect our staff during these uncertain times and to get them home to their families at a reasonable hour. Please contact Josh Heptig, SLO County Parks Golf Superintendent at jheptig@co.slo.ca.us and he will gladly help make this situation right. Be well and happy golfing!'}</resp>< gmap_id>

< Review>
Pretty 9-hole course in a beautiful wildlife location. Beware if going for twilight...it starts at 4pm and they kick you off course at 7pm, even if there’s plenty of daylight. Per the mangaement's response below...Great! It's wonderful to have your staff be home at a more reasonalbe hour. I request the golf course begin the twilight rate at 3:00pm (like other local courses) instead of 4:00pm. This would allow a little more space to play more than 9 holes. As it is, you have to be on of the first groups off to play more than 9. Thank you.<//Review>

Beautiful nine-hole golf course in a spectacular setting. Challenging hilly layout puts the emphasis on driving accuracy, with some room to roam without getting lost. Once in position, you'll be hitting uphill or down into large inviting greens with few sand traps. Marine layer is often present in the morning and wind is always a factor in the afternoon. It's walkable, but it's a good hike!< /Review>

Their driving range have stunning views. It was quite windy today. Definitely worth it. We bought two 60 balls for $7 each.<//Review>

< Review>
Nice 9 holes of golf, through valleys and canyons. Winter and spring best time to play.  Summer and fall can get hot, & dry. Be prepared for losing some ball. If you don't hit the fairways, your ball is gone.
Nice driving range, large practice putting green.  Ask about renting a hole for an hour, for a nice way to practice.</Review>

<text>Dairy Creek is our go to course! Perfect Twilight hour prices! Beautiful and great wildlife throughout the course.

There is one "bartender" we experienced our very first time that was not knowledgeable in cocktails and gave us ours in a small 4oz water cup.....  she said 7 times... I work here one day a week. Turkey Club and fries were good!!

Park your car as close to or in view of the Pro Shop, there was a couple of SUVs that had broken windows on them on day leaving the course several weeks ago.

Catch you on the green!!</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1580275794693, 'text': 'Thanks for the review and we are sorry that you were here to experience the car damage. We’re still not sure what happened that day.'}< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

Has always been my favorite course. Because of lack of water source the course now only uses the back nine for golfers. Such a shame as it is a great course. Has a good driving range and chipping area.</review>

< review>
Once a premier 18 hole course, the track is now the most challenging 9-hole course on the Central Coast.  The course was reduced due to water woes, but the back 9 was kept, and is in great shape, featuring 3 par 3's, 3 par 4's and 3 par 5's in a a majestic natural setting.  The green fees are very reasonable, at $15  to walk (add $9 per rider for cart), and a replay is just $5 ($1 for county card holders) to walk, and the twilight rate after 4 is just $14.< /review>

<review>I want to start by saying the staff here are byfar the BEST. Our day was already off to a sub par start because our reservations at Laguna were canceled when we got there due to a Jr. Golf Tournament and the staff forgot to inform us or block it off on their calendars. Coupled with the fact they did not refund us even though we asked them... instead they gave us “come back later” cards. We called Dairy Creek and they said we could most likely walk on after hearing our story.

The day got worse when we arrived and within minutes from teeing off, I realized I lost my wedding band. I placed it on the back of the golf cart to apply sunscreen and didn’t realize til we were already on the fairway. I spent HOURS (5+) looking for it and even had a professional ring finder help with his metal detector. After hours of searching, exhausted and defeated I left my number with the pro shop staff and went home. The nice gentlemen at the pro shop said they’d keep an eye out for it and even go out themselves to look when things slowed down. They even refunded me for my 9 holes + golf cart use because I never made it past the 1st hole.

I was CERTAIN it was gone for good. Fast forward to within 15 minutes of arriving home, I get a phone call saying one of the staff had found my ring!!! I can’t believe how dedicated the staff were and how empathetic they were. My husband and I will definitely be coming back here for the excellent service we received. Though we prefer the “easier” course at Laguna, I really couldn’t care for the lack of good service there.

Thanks Dairy Creek!! You guys rock< /review>< Pictures>

Great place for everyday golfing. Grass is a little rough and has a confusing layout but over all is great for families.<//review>

<review>Course is in good shape and enjoy links style, but SUPER windy here most of the time and one of the worst hamburgers I've ever had.   C'mon guys we're on the central coast surrounded by natural beauty and your serving cafeteria burgers and charging $9 for the awefulnes?  Shame on you< /review>< pics>

This place is in very rough shape. The greens are a mess and the tee boxes are a disaster.  I don't know what happened to it but a few years ago it was really nice.  It's a shame to see how neglected it has become.</Text>

There is no housing on or around the course, which boasts some dramatic elevation changes, with forced carries over water and rocky arroyos.The par-71 course rises and falls by 300 feet twice, offering wonderful views of the surrounding El Chorro Valley.< /review>< gmap_id>

<Text>Finally served proper portions!

I got a bowl with a tortilla under everything and it was good. The server put the ingredients without being stingy haha.

One thing that was kind of annoying was that there were way too many workers and it ended up in them being loud and talking too much. Don’t really mind it but it can slow down their work

< Review>
I have been to this Chipotle many times in the past and went for lunch today. The service is quick and the ability to start it online and just pick it up is extremely convenient. I feel as though the portions especially the meat are becoming smaller over time and it does not feel like a good deal anymore. Hopefully that can change in the future as that is one of the main reasons why I started going there.< /Review>

Great place. There was a guy named Adrian working the register and they were out of what I wanted but he offered me an alternative and was super helpful and polite. He made the experience great. And Gerica was great at making the bowls.< /review>

Enjoy this place. Chicken bowl is my favorite. Gets packed sometimes because of the school but the staff tends to try and make things move somewhat fast.</text>

(it was my first time at Chipotle) I was soooooo disappointed in the queso! It was horrible I would NOT recommend it to anyone.

Ah Chipotle. Always so fast at this location. I've been to some locations where you have to wait like 10-15 minutes just to order. This one, I'm usually in and out in 5-10 minutes tops.<//review>

Usually I'm pretty happy with the food and service, but there is the occasional visit that I get chips and they have obviously been sitting there for awhile, causing them to be a little stale. Other than that, it's all good.< /review>

Chipotle needs to improve on the amount of food.

Maybe I hit this place at the wrong time the staff was not very friendly i spent $35 on food for 2 adults and a kid and my burrito was half the size they usually make them plus the area in front is under construction not very convenient.</Text>

This place is AMAZING!!!! The food was SO DELICIOUS!! My husband claims that they have THE BEST turkey sandwich EVER!

Very reasonably prices & good size portions. The service was fast & easy to get through the line. The food is delivered to your table. People were social distancing & wearing mask. I appreciate it all & will definitely be back!</review>

I'll be honest, I was expecting another overrated burger joint but the food & drinks here just blew me away! I love that you can have any burger as a chicken sandwich & even though craft beer is one of their beverage staples, I chose to go with a chocolate shake which are made with custard instead of ice cream. Delicious! Overall, this place may be a little more price- wise for fast food but it's definitely worth it!👍< /text>

The food was great at The Stand. We had the BBQ Brisket Sandwich and the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich, both were very tasty. Follow me on Instagram at South Orange County Eats (@soceats) to see my full review of this and many other local restaurants.< /Text>

<Text>Really good place new to the RSM area. Burgers are phenomenal, right on point good quality everything. I'm happy this place opened up as I've heard wonders of this LA chain. Go grab a sandwich, shake, hot dog beer, burger...you won't be disappointed< /Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMFABN-TDtd98c7YtDJxmG_7-AkvEJ2sJJ-Yhs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP_rZApGEkYJI7rNdq-hvgxJMINofzit0pLqAI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< Response>

The food here is delicious!!!

That should be the full review. Not enough? Ok here is what I tried:
Short Rib Grilled Cheese. My wife had that one and didn't wanna share it with me cuz it was too good.
Buffalo Chicken Sandwich. Perfect buffalo flavor, not too strong, and matched perfectly with the slaw. Also got some sweet potato fries with it and they're amazing. Perfect texture and sweetness.
Finished it off with the Cinnamon Crunch Milkshake. One of my favorite cereals as a dessert was perfect on a typical sunny SoCal day.

I wish there was one of these in North Orange County so I wouldn't have to drive all the way down to south county to get some.</Review>

We got the Buffalo Chicken Sandwhich, Cobb Salad, Brussel Sprouts, Sweet Potato Fries, and a hot dog for our son (the only hotdogs he will eat!). Everything was spot on! You gotta get the burger sauce and house made fire sauce on the side. Not the mention the house made pickles are a must. And the milkshakes! WOW, now that I think about it, EVERYHTING IS SO GOOD! This location is a little bigger than others and has a great outdoor area to eat. The staff was very helpful with cleaning and keeping the place tidy to make us feel welcome and safe to eat. This is a perfect place to eat for the whole family (even the parents can enjoy a great selection of craft beers!). Anyways, all this talking is making me hungry.....Going back ASAP!!!<//review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

< Review>
A nice spot. The owner is friendly, and helpful. I ate the Pulled Pork sandwich. It was flavourful. 5 BBQ sauces are available. Each is sooo great, though, personally, the spicy one has quite a bite to it! The baked beans were fantastic! A little cupcake came along with the meal. It was soft, and delicious. Overall an excellent lunch!< /Review>

Had to give this place a go before it closed. Massively sad to see such a quality mom and pop BBQ place leave the Turlock area. All the meat is wonderfully tender and flavorful even without the delicious rub that comes alongside it. The prices are understandably high, as the quantity of food you get for your purchase is filling for even two people. I highly recommend people patronize this place while it's still around.</review>

<Text>Service with a smile, lots of parking, wonderful smell, and happy bbq atmosphere. I'm not family or an old friend so the review that said good ratings must only be friends and family is not true. I ordered the hotlink it was hot and tasty and had a nice bite to it. There's lots of things to add to it pickles, wax peppers, jalapenos, five different types of mixed  barbecue sauce, and of course ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise. You may not be a friend when you enter but you'll be a friend when you leave. I say get out of the long lines for that nasty burger and go get some real meet at Burt's;)<//Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN4XdEVk6Txc5ieWcvQPMR1lh7SxfRKu7bssSvf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x8091075d771692c7:0x204db1698854143d< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

We've been meaning to come in for a while and it was well worth coming in for! The meat was really tender and delicious even without their BBQ sauce, as it should be! I love that they support the men and women in the service as well! Very friendly staff, great regulars giving tips on what to try next, fabulous atmosphere.

But I had one problem. I meant to save half my pulled pork sandwich for my work lunch, but it was too good and I couldn't stop myself. Definitely going to buy a second sandwich next time to avoid this "problem!" W< /Text>

<review>MY SON AND I STOPPED IN ON TUESDAY AFTER GOING TO COSTCO.  THIS PLACE IS A HIDDEN GEM.  THE PLACE IS CLEAN.  THE OWNERS ARE JUST THE NICEST PEOPLE AND THE FOOD IS AMAZING.  WE HAD THE RIBS AND PULLED PORK SANDWICH.  BOTH WERE SO FLAVORFUL.  THEIR VARIETY OF SAUCES IS GREAT (TRY THE HONEY AND BROWN SUGAR BBQ SAUCE).  DEFINITELY  A MUST GO IF YOU LIKE BBQ.<//review><rating>5<//rating>< Pictures>

The meat is cooked to perfection and the sauces (optional, it’s not there to hide the flavor of mediocre meat like some places) are the best I’ve ever had. The owners are supper friendly, or I would sneak in just to steal the spicy sauce and reverse engineer the recipe.  ;)< /review><pics>None</pics>< response>

Not all that great. I was craving bbq food so I chose to go there and I was kinda disappointed. Their “sides” are so small. Looks like a small sample cup. I would’ve rather got two sides than a side and chips. I was going to try their potato salad but it’s literally looked like two bites.. the ribs were alright. Docs Q’in Pits is better! I unfortunately won’t be coming back here.< /review>

<Review>This is the best place for BBQ in the valley ! The tri tip sandwiches are amazing! The customer service is unreal. I once ordered through grub hub and because grub hub couldn't get a driver in the time that it was promised to be delivered ,the owner delivered it ! We already loved the place but this was just incredible .<//Review>< pics>

I was really disappointed with the food here! We hardly were given any meat and what meat we did get was dry we didnt get bbq sauce. The potato salad tasted old and was very small. The prices felt like we were robbed,they literally ONLY gave us 3 ribs but charged us 11 bucks the chicken was incredibly small and dry and the tri tip tasted like a thin flattened out dehydrated belt! I was really upset because I REALLY WANTED TO LIKE THIS PLACE but REGRETFULLY I WON'T be BACK!<//review>

I've been to this place so many times. And Every time I have went I was always greeted very nicely by the owners. They have been open since July 8 2015.
They prepare some of the most delicious BBQ Food in Turlock. I was told he likes to barbecue the meat, ribs, chicken, and pork with rubs. But they also have 6 different home made barbecue sauce flavors available to try out.
If you like Tri-Tip, Ribs, Pulled Pork, Chicken, Sausage, and Linguica (Portuguese sausage).
Then this is a place I highly recommend the next time your feeling hungry.< /review>

Every company has ups and downs;. Besides they are professional, care about costumers and employees, people are so friendly, many opportunities on different departments, understand employees needs as well as costumers expectations.</text>

<Text>This company have no respect for their employees. Just there only 2 months they let me go. They expect to much high expectations from u. The machines go down sometimes and they still expect your numbers to be high. U would have to wait for more totes to get to u. Then when you have to take cases out and empty them out it makes your numbers go down. The management at night are rude to u. Then they get on the intercom and rush u to hurry up. I thank the company for the chance to work there but medline u do need to have respect for people and treat them with dignity. I advice people if u work there be careful< /Text>< pictures>

This is one of the easiest pickups for commercial drivers I've ever experienced. The staff is friendly and professional. The years is spacious and clean. Other business should look to Medline as an example.</review>

Easy distribution center. Entrance on Miro Way road.  Warehouse offloads their own product, unless product is fallen off the pallets. ... STRICT APPOINTMENT TIMES. Do not be late, you will be refused. Required valid driver license to gain entry.< /text>

<review>Probably One Of The Best Thermo King Location I Have Dealt With! Decided To Get All My Thermo-King Units Controlled From The IPhone App. Had The Pleasure To Work With Ceaser.  His Service Was Top-Notch Since Day One! From Explaining How It Works, To Setting Up My Account, And Solving All Of My Problems, He Was There Without A Hesitation. He Is Definitely Very Informative And Has Great Knowledge On Thermo King Products. Would Recommend Him To Everyone!

<review>Please change your hours on Google. It's very misleading.  if the location is closed on Saturday it should be marked closed. Not open from 7AM to 3PM. Carriers have pay for call out service for the the misleading information submitted by thermoking central owner. And there is no way out of the fees.

I'll update my rating when the issue is fixed.

We planned according to hours listed by the owner of thermoking to pickup the trailer but were trapped and hit with the fees. NOT GOOD< /review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPukYIiJsQ8NsNlNNLtaWoPJXafSO0P9OVaivLo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><Response>{'time': 1537897031208, 'text': 'Sorry Harpreet for the confusion on our hours.

I’m dealing with Fresno Thermoking since 2005. Going there every year for reefer service and for trailer repair. Justin in Reefer service and Arnie for trailer repair always there for helpful service. Always great customer service. Never had any problem with them. You can park your truck there when you go there for reefer maintenance at your responsibility.  I recommend this place for reefer repair. 👍👍</Text>

< review>
Been here about 7 times over last last 2 years finally decided to write a review I've noticed that whenever I come for service I can drop my trailer and am in and out in a decent amount of time but whenever​ I have come for parts I always have to wait easy 15 to 25 mins even with only one or two people in line. They usually have only one guy working on customers the other guy on the phone helping customers over the phone. Save your time and call in what you need they deliver it in a decent amount of time but if you go in for something simple like a little led light u will wait unreasonably<//review>

We needed trailer door hinges replaced on our Vanguard dry van.  Called Thermo King, they said bring it on in, they had us in the shop  5 minutes after we arrived there and repairs completed in less than one hour. Good shop, great people!  Highly recommended!</Review>

< Review>
I Called on friday to make sure if they will be open on saturday because of the labor day weekend. They said yes they will be open, but on saturday apparently they are closed. There is a guy working but they are closed, and to pick up my trailer it is going to be 358 dollars extra. After the technician talked to the manager he said it will be half of it. I just need to hook up my trailer and pay for it. Yard is open I can see the trailer but I cant hook up and go because its apparently closed even though I called in and made sure.</Review>

I brought my reefer for servicing, they said it should be ready in 2 hours. Sounds great!! Booked the load, called thermoking if my trailer is ready? No its not ready, we order a part, which will be here tomorrow and your trailer will be done tomorrow. I was shocked to here why nobody called me about the this. Not only this, but the person i talked said "thats a good question " when i asked why nobody called me. How can be they so irresponsible and shameless. Next day when i called them if my trailer is ready now, they said no it will take 40 minutes to install the part and than we will do the service if you want. I am like what???? That is the reason i was there at first place and now you are asking me if i want my trailer to get serviced. Second day in a row i have to cancel the load and they are totally calm about it nothing like if they are sorry or anything. Worst experience. I am not saying don't go to their store but asking management to be more responsible.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Nice chill ambiance outside.
Heat lamps, horse shoe pit, small golf driving range with net....
Plenty of seating, beers on tap, yummy food. Food might be slightly higher than other restaurants in Hayfork, but good things cost more n at times take longer. Happy to support this establishment.
Will come again.< /Text>

Trinity, the owner, is great and so is the food. The patio outback is great on a sunny day. There is a horse shoe pit out back as well. We go there quite often, but it's a great place to stop on your way to the coast. A little out of the way but worth the detour.< /Review>

<user>104965113418653346303<//user><pics>None</pics><rate>1</rate><Review>As a restaurant owner and chef, I was so dissapointed with the service my friend and I got.  I fist told my server I hate IPAs and pale ales, her suggested beer to me was a pale ale.  I couldnt drink it,  but was charged for it.  Then  i ordered another glass of wine, I got my food.  Then 20 minutes later my friend got her food, which was served on bread that wasnt even cooked.  Our drinks were empty,  i was going to get a few more rounds for us.  We still had plates full of food and the server came out handed us our bill, some boxes,  and told us we could pay when we were ready.    Our server was so rude,  it seemed like she felt threatened that two pretty ladies were in her tiny town.   Also, if they would have just asked us if we wanted another drink or how things were thwy would have gotten a big fat tip.<//Review>< user_name>

Trucking is extremely competitive these days. Some logistics co - a few - really shine. Many have a hard time keeping up with the pack. R&L is in the secondary category, in my opinion.<//review>

<review>We ordered an $1,100 product, and paid $160 for shipping through R&L carriers. I must say, Customer service was very attentive and we were notified by R&L that our product had been received at the warehouse earlier than anticipated, so we were able to receive our product 2 days sooner. The product was delivered undamaged. Very prompt and professional! I would definitely use their services again!</review></record></dataset><record>

We purchased a $2200 product and paid $450 for shipping. R+L carriers was the delivery service. The man who delivered our package first of was extremely dismissive and not friendly. He apparently should have had help with the delivery of the package as it looked to be a two man job. He dropped our package multiple times trying to offload it, the pallet it was on was smashed to pieces because of all the drops. After he left and we opened our package we had to build our product where we found several damaged items. Upon filing a complaint with this company of course they put the blame back on us saying we should have not signed the receipt. When we mentioned how would we have know it was damaged if we weren't able to see inside, they said too bad it was ur fault for accepting the package. Very unprofessional and I can't believe they would allow their delivery driver to handle our product in this way and not take any sort of accountability. I even have pictures with the proof of how he handled our product.<//review>

<Rate>1< /Rate><review>This company called days in advance to schedule a delivery appointment. We are receving 7 pallets. 2400 lbs of equipment. People were paid to be onsite to unload truck and receive. Driver did not call, after waiting for hours I was told by corporate office customer support  there have been ongoing issues for weeks out of Fontana distribution center and that this office simply stops answering the phone to provide updates. I was told this several times as i was forced to call multiple times to get updates. This experience cost a great deal of money, and worse yet I now have to break commitments because of this companies failure. Customer service had no resolution to offer and  management to speak with. I am told they cant even guarantee they will be out tomorrow for  delivery and that I can leave my number for a manager to call me back. Do not work with this shipping provider. Absolutely awful company that operates with zero regard for the damages they cause through their failures.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

This company has a terrible service. It was the first time I have ever got the worst service like this.
They delivered supplies to us and left outside of our office. Since there was no one at office that time to help me to get these heavy supplies inside. I asked for help, the driver denied to do it and I called the company's customer service, the lady denied to help me as well. All they said "it was not their duty".< /Text>

Poor customer service. Driver arrived 2 hours late, and missing one piece of my delivery. They contacted the “dock” and said they located it there and they would reach out for delivery. I never received contact from them, so I called them each day to schedule a delivery. They could not find it and said they would call me when they did. Never received call. I called them and they said they located it and would be out for delivery. Next day no delivery, I called again and they said it would be out for delivery, and again no delivery.

Went on R+L website like the admin has been commenting on most feedback to get customer support and look into the problem. No response.

Had the retailer I purchased from contact them and they said I can call and schedule delivery. I scheduled delivery for the next day and again no delivery or phone call...

Don’t bother with R+L carriers coming out of Fontana, CA. They don’t follow through on commitments and ends up being a big waste of time and money.<//Review>

I work here as a p&d driver and Ive worked at other carriers that I thought were bad but r&L tops them..very disorganized. I come in at 10 and I don't leave the yard till noon with 12 to 14 deliveries ..ludacrous. I have to almost fight to get a tractor and everyday my trailer is loaded wrong..do yourself a favor and look elsewhere, I am.</Text>

Unbelievable. The delivery man forgot to give me my package. I call back multiple times telling them my package is missing and they don’t do anything about it. How in the world can you not do your job. I paid money for this and it can’t even be delivered to me correctly.< /review>

I was going out of state for a month and no one would be home to accept the item. Contacted shipper and explained my situation. They delivered the crate the same day I called which was the only day I had to accept it. Great customer service. I would highly recommend them. Thank you to the Fontana California hub for going out of your way to accommodate me.</Review>< gmap_id>

Terrible service, my package was at the Fontana warehouse and was supposed to be delivered a week ago but now it's in Atlanta. When I called they had no clue how it ended up in the wrong state but promised that it would be sent back to California and I would receive a call to schedule a new appointment but guess what... Neither has happened, my package is still sitting in Atlanta and it's been a whole week. This company is terrible and does not care about it's customers.<//text>

Horrible service!  Not sure whos running this place but will never do buiseness with this company. The level of professionalism and service is a zero, no respect for customers time or needs! If i had a chance to give a zero star i would, but know that a 1 star is not deserved.< /Review>

Wish I could give less than one star. This carrier constantly destroys shipments and then refuses to pay up unless you go through so much bureaucratic BS you come out of the experience steaming.  "Who has possession of this?. Well they have to file". "Well this person should have fought with the driver" etc.  What kind of claims agent tells you I should have fought with the driver over who holds onto the shipment? Then when it gets returned to the original shipper tells me well they should have refused receipt of it and forced R & L to hang on to it.  You have no idea how much more silly the situation is, I wont type the whole thing, all over $500. Beware!!< /Text>

<text>Very tasty. Much good! The bread was baked with butter so you had the most perfectly buttery toast. It was very savory and my fiance ate his before I could even ask for a bite. The French Fries we're very well seasond and the onion rings we're addictive. Plus it had amazing customer service. If you've read my other posts you'll know I'm picky. They made my sandwich to my exact specifications. After the food was delivered to our table the waiter was very attentive and brought fast service!!<//text><rating>5<//rating>< user_name>

I come here for the turkey club, and it's THE BEST I have ever had.  I'll certainly be back for the rest of the menu. I'll be sending everyone I know to this place.<//review>

< Review>
AWESOME SANDWICH PLACE! Kind of a tucked away gem, didn't think Google maps was directing me correctly. Anyways, great sandwich place to have a bite, there affordable and have a HUGE menu and it's not just sandwiches either. They have burgers, burritos numerous different types of food. Don't let the name fool you not only sandwiches! Definitely worth a try, great prices considering the portions are generous and so are the owners. Can't say enough good things and there macaroni salad is fantastic. My wife doesn't even like macaroni salad but everytime we eat here she gets it as a side, sometimes even gets an extra side to take home. That says something right there! They also have a good potato salad/sides options and everything else you would expect at a good sandwich shop. You can also order ahead for pick up if in a hurry or anything else. Grab a togo menu when your there, bc it's extensive and you will always be able to find something new the next time you go, see if you can work through the whole menu sometime, lol. Anyways great little sandwich, lunch, early dinner gem tucked away. Worth the visit!<//Review>

This was my second time in the area for work in 8 months. I was so impressed the first time even though I wasn't very hungry today I told myself I'd regret it if I didn't stop. I was kind of nervous thinking maybe I had remembered it being greater than it really was, but as soon as I walked in I was greeted kindly. I ordered the Big Daddy and it did not disappoint in fact, all of a sudden when I saw it I was hungry. It was awesome.< /Text><username>Ivan Cervantes</username><time>1575429987294< /time>< Rating>

<Review>This place was ok. The menu is decent size, but the food was just ok. The macaroni and potato salads are not made in house and the hamburgers are from frozen patties. This place would be much better if they used better, quality ingredients.<//Review>< pictures>

Pastrami was good but too much mustard. Fries and ranch excellent but did have to pay extra for the ranch. Still a good deal for the money. Service just a little slow for getting in ahead of the rush.< /text>

I have tried to like this place, the food is delicious, but I constantly get a slightly wrong order. Forgetting to hold the mayo, leaving out the avocado on a Turkey/Bacon/Avocado, or forgetting bacon on my bacon cheeseburger, I just can't deal with it anymore. I don't want to have to check my order before I take it back to work, because I can't afford the time for them to have to fix it.  It's a shame, I really like their food.<//review>

Omg what have I been missing.  Their food is delicious. Try the cilantro ranch chicken sandwich. Breakfast burritos are delicious. Everything I’ve had is super yummy here and the staff is really nice. Angela was great and very friendly. Love this place. The decor could use a little updating but I really don’t care what it looks like since the food is good.</Review>

So yesterday we were sitting at the brewery  next to the sandwich factory.  We got hungry!So we went ahead and ordered food from there. They delivered food to the brewery. Everything was delicious! Tacos were to die for! My husband couldnt believe how close to real tacos from Mexico they tasted.
Definitely will be coming back! Super friendly staff and great good. Thank you!< /Review>

I give it one star because it's consistently crappie and I see that star crashing to the ground like a burning Panini.
Let's start with that cheap white bread they call a roll, its more like Weber bread molded in the shap of a roll. Id rather eat subway bread. What kind of self respecting people call this a deli, it's more like a cafeteria food. I got a got pastrami and a Italian, which where both dry, especially  the pastrami... I wouldn't be surprised to find they buy it precooked and sliced. The man working the registar with the big black mustache had the personality of a robot. It took close to 10 minutes to get my food at 1:45 and no one  in front of me.
If anyone knows of a good deli in Ventura let me know.<//review>

Meh... Got the Italian, bread was sort of stale. Opted for the cole slaw which was a mistake. Don't think I'll be making a return trip.< /Text>

<Text>They know their stuff. From the eldest to the youngest, they speak the language of the trade so you can understand it. (I actually think it is family members working there. I heard somebody call someone "Dad"). It is neat and clean. What is for sale looks like a display. So enter slowly, the entrance road does not belong to this business. But enter you must to see the fascinating stuff for sale.<//Text>< Resp>

Went to dine at the Vietnamese restaurant along with my brother and niece ( Pho) in the pavilion. The food was good, had a beef stew noodle soup and an avocado smoothie. We all had soup of different kinds ( beef and chicken). The service was good. We will go back to this restaurant again when  we are  in the area.<//text>

Shopping center has lots of stores from Dollar Tree CVS to Trader Joe's. My Dollar Tree stop was not successful they were out of most things I needed and many shelves were empty. However,  I went in the evening it may be better in the morning.<//Review>

Love Trader Joe's, Dollar Tree and Simply Greek etc etc... The businesses are fantastic.. However the parking lot is beyond a nightmare. I purposely stay away unless it's in off hours. Today I came with my 8 yr old daughter. On our way out we were almost run over by a man and his wife in a minivan desperate for a close spot. He was not paying attention. I felt the wind and vibration from his van and I was behind my cart. My daughter who was on the side of the cart, had she been turned straight instead of sideways looking at me would have been hit. This man didn't care, refused to apologize, insisted he'd been there a long time. I was so flabbergasted. Two horrible lessons for my daughter to learn, 1) driving irresponsibly is ok and 2) you don't need to take responsibility when you are wrong. They definitely at the very least need cameras here and preferably a police presence who will stop these Mario Andretti drivers. So sad my day out with my girl ended like this. It's just wrong!!!</review>

<text>It's gone through a number of transitions over the years now anchored by Ranch99 on one end and trader Joe's on the other.  In the process of rebuilding the facades so it will look more modern.  Large plaza with many stores on both sides of the road.< /text>< name>

I like how they are renovating this area to make it look nicer. With new shops and some fixing up, it will definitely attract more people.< /text>

Went to the new Trader Joe's and was it packed. There's a lot of parking but you have to be patient to allow shoppers to leave. I like this center and have been coming here for more than 20 years.< /review>
