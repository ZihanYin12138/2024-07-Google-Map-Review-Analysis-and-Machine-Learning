<Text>This place is definitely one of the best, if not THE best, places I’ve ever dined at. My wife and I decided to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary here and were thoroughly impressed. The service, hospitality, and quality of food were of the best that we’ve enjoyed in a very long time. I’d highly recommend this place to anyone who’s looking for a great dining experience!! We look forward to visiting again soon!</Text>< Pictures>

<Text>Great setting and service. Sadly, the price is way above what it should be given the quality of the food. Cocktails are poorly crafted, the food is greasy, salty, and not refined: I am ok with that for prices ranging 10$ a cocktail and 20$ a main, but it is 14$ a cocktail and 30-40$ a main. I won’t come back.<//Text><userid>106255424794425072671<//userid><Gmap_id>0x808fa590a27e8d5b:0xc3a5b1bc973cae49<//Gmap_id>< Time>

What a great restaurant outside of the downtowns and busy streets. The Parkside Grille is a rather quaint, welcoming, and cozy restaurant with great ambiance and delicious food/drink. The service was also supurb. I'll definitely be back!

A few recs:
- Salmon entree
- Mahi entree (was a special)
- Grilled goat cheese appetizer<//Review>

We had an excellent time at the Parkside Grille. Owners were very friendly. We ordered the Chile Relleno  and the Ahi Tuna for entrees and both dishes were delectable! The Boston Cream pie for dessert was really rich and delicious. Located right under some giant redwood trees, this place is a true gem!< /text>

< review>
This place is a true gem. It's hidden within the windy roads of Portola Valley so only those who "know" and "care" would ever find this place. The restaurant is in a corner, sort of a steakhouse feel, but then with rustic yet somewhat modern finish. Fits the redwoods surrounding the village.

Let's start with the fresh baked bread that comes out. Oh my god, this is so good. No garnish needed. Just bread and butter. It already puts you in a fantastic mood and we had a tough time resisting to dig for more lest we fill our stomachs.

We tried the margherita pizza, linguine vongole, ceasar salad with anchovies, chicken tenders and spaghetti with fries. All the food is prepared "home-style". It definitely is not garnished and visually overdone. It stays truthful to the dish and you can definitely feel the chef's love. The chick tenders are freshly hand-made as one can tell by the irregular yet non congealed texture. The linguine was made with fresh clams, but again, staying truthful to the ingredients and bringing out its flavor. The pizza was simple, yet effective.

This is Californian / American high-end comfort food at its best. It does not get better than this - starting from the atmosphere all the way to desert. The staff is friendly and professional and the food is cooked with a degree of professional homeliness. Top all of this with not-too-bad prices. Again, not cheap. But very reasonable.

We'll definitely return!</review>

Wonderful meal. Easily the best in Portola Valley. A bit away from everything but super friendly staff and a great meal. Hey risotto was very tasty and even their Mac and cheese was above and beyond the usual shells and cheese.

Certainly on the pricey side but will definitely be back.</text>

<Review>I had a wonderful dinner here. It was one of my favorite restaurant experiences of the year. I can't wait to re-visit. Hours are not typical. So check in advance and reserve a table for best scenario. Although reservations are not required. The staff is super friendly and polite. I really enjoyed the gourmet food twists and the wonderful service​ was pleasant and non-intrusive.<//Review>< rating>

<Review>In particular, awesome lamb chops.  A bit pricey, but they make it up in food quality and service.  In the middle of the idyllic (though definitely upscale) neighborhood---I also enjoy the drive there during sunset hours.  Upside down pineapple cake is a unique and great a dessert.  Steaks are huge (for me anyway)---make sure to pace yourself with starters!< /Review>< Date>

<review>Whew, talk about overrated. It's not like this place is bad per se, but I don't know why anyone would eat here given all the other good restaurants in the Bay Area. Maybe if you live in Portola Valley, but otherwise it's definitely not worth going.

My wife made a reservation for us to go here with her parents visiting from outside the country. They really enjoy good food, and it was actually slightly embarrassing given how average the food was here.

Again, it's not like the food is awful or anything. But our standard for a good restaurant is that it should be better or more difficult than what we can cook at home. Food like roasted salmon, a hamburger, etc. don't count unless it's amazing, which here, it's just not.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<Text>I have used Above All Heating & Air a few times over the last couple years. They have always been very responsive, professional and punctual. The technicians are knowledgeable and willing to take the time to tell me what is wrong and how they are going to fix it. They are also very competitive in their pricing!
Great job, I will definitely use their service as needed in the future!<//Text><pics>None</pics><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x80c35d890ad50e17:0xf79f8816a9ab218f<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Larry is an outstanding customer-first oriented businessman and A/C technician. Our church has twice benefited from his gracious assistance on our units and my wife and I appreciated the time he spent on our home's A/C, for which labor he modestly charged. Larry is friendly and knowledgeable. We hope to enjoy his service for many years to come.< /Review>

Pete the owner was on my call.  I needed a tune up but was also looking at getting a new condenser.  I have the old style freon one, but it's only about 7-8 years old.  He said mine still sounds and runs like new.  Don't even think about replacing it.  He didn't try to sell me anything I didn't need.  Told me what to do to keep it running like a champ!  I will for sure be using Above All from now on.  Family owned is the way to go!< /review>

It's never a good time to have to replace your HVAC unit. Larry made the experience a good one. Always patient with my questions and concerns. Great attention to detail and pride in his work.< /Review>

Last week in 102 degrees, my AC went out.  Larry, at Above All, made time for us and fixed what needed fixing right away.
He showed me the why and how of what needed repairing and answered my questions, even when I asked the same ones a couple of times.  He's officially my "nice guy" and I'm ready to adopt him.
Also, he made the job affordable, which other seniors will appreciate.<//review>

I called and left a message,  about 1-2 hours later i got the call and Larry was fantastic!  He gave me a 2 hour window about 3 hours later and was on time. Our AC was about 10 years old and was not working.  He checked it out from one end to the other, replaced my air filter (No Charge) then found my thermostat was bad and replaced that.  Every thing works well and the price was very reasonable.< /review>

Highly recommend Larry and Above All Heating & Air Inc. !! Our AC went out last night and we woke up to a hot house extremely early.  I called Above All and left a message at 6:10am, at 7:40am and one bad condenser later we were fixed and enjoying a cool house once again!! THANKS Larry!!! Super nice guy and explained everything along with a very reasonable price.  All of the reviews are spot on!  Awesome service, we will be calling them out again when we need HVAC!< /review>

It includes the part, labor, and all of the other fun costs associated with doing business in this beautiful state. Your repair was for a single part installed, no additional charges were added for rinsing out your coil or unplugging the condensate drain lines. I believe we are very reasonable, provide great service and stand behind our work. We are glad that you’re pleased with our service and hope you are comfortable referring us!\nThank you'}< /response>< gmapID>

We so appreciate this Company and the great customer service they offer as well as the great Service Technician who came to our rescue.  Do not hesitate to call them for all your heating and air conditioning needs.. We have used them for years and will continue to do so.  Thank you and you are Above All!</text>< username>

We panicked when our AC wouldn’t turn on. We called Above all heating after being referred.
We were so bummed when they didn’t answer, so i left a message. I was worried they were going to be like every other business and not call back. To our surprise within minutes we got a call back, and not only a call back but they stated they would head right over!
Thank you for being an amazing company and fixing our AC fast, and at a great price.
We found our company for all our HVAC needs.
Honest company with great prices, who does what they say!!!! Highly recommend.<//review>

The technician, Larry, came and fixed my mom's furnace which sits on top of the roof.  It was already dark, cold and everything was still wet from all of the rain the day before, but he got up there and fixed it.  The next day, the heater had surprisingly stopped working.  I called Larry and he went back over to my mom's house and again fixed the issue with no extra charge.  I appreciate his honest work and getting my mom's  heater back to working order.  Thank you Larry!  You did an outstanding job!<//text>

Had Above All come out on a weekend to fix our A/C and he was so honest. He told us that it was only a 60.00 part and he could have it fix by Monday. And the other a/c companies wanted to replace the whole unit.<//Text>

<review>This is true Air conditioning repair. Above All Heating & Air saw my capacitor was bad & replaced it in less than 20 minutes. Didn’t try to sell me a new unit or anything unnecessary. Honest and good at their job.</review>< Pics>

Called in the morning and they came out that day. Very courteous on the phone, and so was the technician. Problem was solved with out taking my arm or leg. Very pleased with Above All Heating.<//Review>

<Review>Can you even believe this before and after was achieved with one days notice and 5 short hours of hard work? 👏👏👏 Darlene is getting all of the applause from our family!

I called the day prior to my appointment and told her I was visiting the area for two weeks and needed her assistance ASAP. She booked me an opening (7 hour slot) for the very next day and it was an easy drive of just 56 minutes from Morgan Hill to her location.

Darlene’s skill and master loctician knowledge was exactly the expertise I was looking for. Her kindness was the cherry on top! Oh, and she finished two hours early!

I was very comfortable the whole time and we enjoyed some deep and positive conversations all while enjoying some stand up comedy and then a movie.

This was just the medicine this momma was craving! Darlene took my 4 month old messy dreads (I think you can spot the photo) and turned them into a dreadlock masterpiece (multiple photos).

Thank you, thank you, thank you Darlene! *Parking lot was a major bonus.<//Review>< resp>

Miss Darlene agreed to help detangle/cut/trim my daughter's hair. She was able to salvage the shape/style and transform my daughter's tangled locks into a beautiful princess ponytail. Miss D. was responsive to calls/texts, made and kept our appointment. Her prices are very reasonable. She was kind, gentle, and caring. We drove from SJ and it was worth it. You can tell she cares about her customers. She even sent a follow up text to check in on us. Thanks again :)< /review>

It was the first time my son asked for braids. He’s been growing out his hair since shelter-in-place started. What a pleasure to find Darlene. She invited us for a free consultation. She explained that my son’s hair was not long enough but if he was willing to take the tugging, she would do it. She gave him a sample of the tugging and he decided to wait until his hair got longer. Instead Darlene gave him twists for picture day. He was very happy and kept the twists as long as he could. He’s looking forward to going back sometime next year when his hair is ready for braids! Thank you Darlene!<//Text>

I’ve changed my review to 2 stars primarily because I think the owner lost her professionalism and seemed rude in several occasions. Even with all the great experiences, it’s challenging for me to deal with someone who seems to have an attitude, nit picky or passive aggressive. But the great reviews are accurate- the salon is spacious, beautiful, and clean. The stylists are great. The prices are so reasonable. Darlene responds quickly and is initially professional. We are all growing and this may only be an area of improvement. So this is still a great business to support.</Review>

I had my hair lady cancel on me last minute.. so I decided to call Darlene last minute and she was able to see me within the hour.Not saying that this will always be the case, but the fact that she was able to take me in at such short notice was amazing. Mind you this is my first time ever coming to her. Not only that, she did my faux goddess locks perfectly in such a short amount of time. I would recommend her to any and everyone. She’s truly amazing at her craft. She’s definitely got herself a new regular.< /text>

Went in just knowing I wanted my hair braided but not any particular style. Listening her advice and going with what she thought would look good for me, was the best thing I could have done! I absolutely love the braids she did for me! Always looks good and lasts a long time! I always go to her and will continue to go to her!<//review>

Highly recommend going to this beautiful, clean, fast, and  accommodative braiding shop! I am not from this area and Darlene really saved me, by taking me SAME DAY to remove a poorly done, matted frontal by another stylist. Not only did they remove my 360 frontal install, but also fit me in for a shampoo and condition, and installed two beautiful french braids in 2 hours! Darlene runs a professional business and really instructed me on how to maintain my new braids. Thank you again to the lovely ladies at the shop, and to Darlene, for taking the time to help me with that rats nest!!! So grateful!</Text>

< review>
Brought my daughter in for box braids. Two days prior, I contacted Darlene about an appointment, knowing it could be a long shot to get in, but she was able to accommodate. So we texted and then spoke on the phone, so that she could get details on what we were looking for and set expectations. It was very helpful to us, and also confirmed to me that this was a professional place that knew what they were doing! When we arrived, Miss Shanika was ready and waiting! She turned the TV channel to a kid-friendly Station  (and later put on Moana). She clarified what we wanted, gave some ideas, and got started.  Comfortable, friendly shop...we will definitely return!< /review>

<text>I love this spot! They provide delicious dishes, they have a rich menu, The cook in that place is a real authority in the kitchen, I love very much eating all their food. The dishes are always good, the attitude towards the clients  is very good too. I often go to  this restaurant and I not even once was unsatisfied.  I highly recommend it.< /text>< Pics>

This pizza was the best! We had the chicken garlic and an order of wings and bread sticks for only $31. So cheap and beyond worth it. Highly recommend if you're in the area<//review>

< Review>
Known horrible place to get food from, pizza's come with a 100% guarantee of diarrhea and there breadsticks have hard and dry areas which makes you spit out the food. They are the only pizza place that delivers in this area but if you value your well being, whatsoever, you will drive to a different pizza place to get the quality service you deserve<//Review>

It's take out only, but their pizza is good and the owners are the nicest people ever!  They always go out of their way to make customers happy, which is awesome.  Pizza is priced very reasonable compared to other places in the county.  As long as I'm living in Pine Grove, they will always have my business.< /Text></record>

<Text>Excellent customer service! I think a lot of people are unaware that this location has been open during Covid and they are fully open at present. Angel is an excellent customer service representative and took care of my daughters eyeglasses in a flash. Very attentive and very proficient. I highly recommend LensCrafters at North County Fair.</Text>< Rating>

< Review>
I was in the market for a new pair of prescription glasses and wanted to get a pair without any hassles. I went in and had a quick eye exam then after browsed through the wide selection of frames. Picked out the ones I liked and purchased my new set of glasses. I would definitely recommend LensCrafters as they make the whole process as simple as possible.<//Review>

LensCrafters to the rescue! After losing my glasses in the ocean while on vacation, I was in big trouble. This store got me in within a couple hours for an exam and I was able to walk out seeing with contacts in no time! Extremely helpful, kind, and professional. If I was local, I would no doubt return!< /Review>

From the moment we entered the location, everyone was very helpful, knowledgeable, caring, and professional.  We left with smiles on our faces for the great service we received from everyone! We hadn't used them last year and totally regretted it....no matter where we have lived Lens Crafters has been GREAT, so no more going to the mom and pop joint, it's Lens Crafters from now on.<//review>

I scheduled an appointment online and was not contacted about my insurance information until 2 hours prior to the appointment.The process to check insurance took over an hour between incompetent employees giving me conflicting information and the inneficient system of hanging up and calling back over and over again which I've never experienced at any other medical office. They were literally still calling me 20 minutes before my appointment and then blame me for being late! I called asking for directions to the store and said I'd be right up. When I got there I was 1 minute past the 10 minute grace period and was told to reschedule. At this point I was completely fed up and definitely did not want to reschedule as she had asked me to. You really need to train your employees about different insurance plans and streamline the process for checking coverage. Terrible experience.<//review>

Excellent service at this Escondido, CA location.  Diane Truong performed the examination professionally and efficiently.  Her assistant, Angel, performed several tests to me expertly as well.  My visit with both was highly satisfactory.  I would highly recommend their services to anyone.< /Review>

We were very happy to see that our Lenscrafters store was open after all of the stores that closed during COVID in our local mall. Alma welcomed us at the front of the store and took care of my lens purchase with a smile in her eyes throughout.  She was thorough and detailed.  I appreciated it because my prescription is very strong and my eyeglasses are very expensive.<//text>

<Text>This location was extremely friendly and helpful. We had visited a different location previously that had not been the best experience, so we were hesitant about this appointment. We honestly couldn’t have asked for better customer service. Every single employee, to include the doctor herself, were more than willing to help us. We will absolutely return to this location for our vision needs.< /Text><Date>1611797574839<//Date><Gmap_id>0x80dbf1582ff01805:0xea67d81ff8cf6980<//Gmap_id><user_id>114633652534137604106<//user_id>< pics>

<Review>I recently went in to order prescription sunglasses. They answered all my questions concerning insurance and is handling the Covid situation as best as they can. The entire staff was super friendly and they even told me which frames looked great on me. Shout out to the manager, Alma, for being patient with the process; I was picking between 3 different frames and she helped price each one. I definitely recommend coming here!< /Review>< user>

<Review>We live in really uncertain times right now and to be treated with the outmost kindness and respect is such a blessing. I would like to say that everyone who helped me out from beginning to end had and amazing kind, positive attitude. At first I was skeptical because of one of the reviews, but  I experienced the complete opposite. The Doctor was very knowledgeable and Sami who checked me in was very patient. This store is very clean, has plenty of open space and has a great selection of glasses. THEY ALSO HAVE GREAT DEALS!! I shopped around before coming here and like I stated before, NOTHING COMPARES. I will be definitely bringing in my granddaughters and tell all my friends about this LensCrafters. - My advice to anyone who is indecisive because it’s in a mall location is to give it a try. Everyone in here is kind, knowledgeable, patient, and sweet.<//Review>< pictures>

<text>We were very impressed with the staff!!  We anticipated kind of a hassle in light of Covid-19 restrictions, however, were pleasantly surprised at how smoothly our visit went.  Absolutely everyone we came into contact with, the young ladies as well as Angel, were just delightful and very professional.   The whole process was expedient and pain-free, and the young woman who did the fitting and assisted with choosing glasses was just TERRIFIC.  Can't say enough good things about this place; whomever is managing/training these employees is doing everything right.<//text>< name>

Super grateful for my experience here.  The staff, techs, and opticians are very kind, thorough, and ensured that I was well-cared for.  I would highly recommend.  If I could give this location a 6th star, it would be without a doubt earned!</Review>

I just bought a pair of prescription Ray-Ban sunglasses from Alma at this facility.  She was very helpful in letting me try on various sunglasses and completing my order.  Alma made my experience very smooth and simple, despite the Covid-19 restrictions.  Very clean facility and felt safe.  My sunglasses arrived ahead of schedule and I'm very happy with my purchase!</Review>

Staff was so warm and welcoming. It was my first time ever getting an eye exam and turns put I needed glasses. Sami was so knowledgeable and patient with  me while I browsed and tired on glasses. Sami even took pictures of me so I could compare how each pair looked on me. She is a gem! So kind and made my first experience great!</Text>

My husband needed his first pair of glass and we went to Lens Crafters. Elizabeth, Lori and Sammi were absolutely amazing!!!!!! They know their glasses, they explain everything in such detail you end up not having any questions at all
Thank you all for all of your help and guidance to a new great pair of glasses and education  of his eyes.<//review>

The doctor took the time to explain what astigmatism was. I asked because I wanted to better understand it and Dr. Gentile took the time to draw it out. I really appreciated that. The staff was very attentive and made sure I was being helped from beginning to end. They went above and beyond. Definitely a place I highly recommend.<//Text>

< Review>
Awful service during the pandemic. My prescription is barely two months expired (which expired over the lock down) and the doctor is refusing to honor those months and allow me to buy them. They originally said that the doctor was giving an extension for patients who expired during the pandemic, but in a move of pure greed are now not honoring extension and forcing people to come in for an examination. With elderly cancer patients in out home we are attempting to social distance and limit all unnecessary exposure. Taking my parents back and forth to the hospital with dry contacts has been hard enough while waiting for eye exam stores to open. While the customer service rep rudely told me that I could have purchased them online during the pandemic, I explained to her that there was also no way to get the prescription while they were closed during the shut down either.
I was scheduled for an appointment on Monday but the receptionist told me to wait until she had spoken to the doctor because she was offering extensions as a courtesy. No one called me and my appointment day passed. I called today and was informed that the doctor declined the extension. While I understand that in person appointments are necessary for things like my parents cancer treatments, eye exams with barely expired  prescriptions could easily be solved by offering a one or two month supply (which I would gladly pay for in full) would be the decent thing to for patients who have been loyal Lenscrafters customers for years. I'm sad that this is the way that Lenscrafters has allowed their franchises to handle patients during these troubling times and I will begin to look for other local options for my family's vision needs.
Lenscrafters needs to look at how Kaiser is handling the pandemic. They are the model of how to be decent to people when they are confined to their home for reasons they did not choose.< /Review>

I lost my glasses while traveling and needed an immediate solution. Sammie met me with compassion and did everything she could to get me into a new pair of glasses for as inexpensive as possible. She even managed to get my glasses done in 30 minutes so that I wouldn't be late for my conference. Sometimes nightmares can turn themselves around. Sammie and the team at this location in the mall definitely eased the burden of my dilemma.  And I love my new glasses to boot!</text>

<userid>108743347657596178235</userid><text>This was the second-worst customer service experience of my life.

The salespeople told me they were covered under my insurance, but didn't mention they were out of network, which was important once they botched my glasses.

I had progressive scan lenses made, and I have astigmatism.  After two days of wearing the glasses, I noticed my vision was blurry in the near area of the left eye.  I went to have it corrected, which turned into a month-long ordeal of repeatedly returning, where they were always dismissive of my problems and acted like they were doing me a favor by trying to fix it.

After a month of making adjustments and fabricating a second pair of lenses, they told me the glasses were perfect and maybe I just don't adjust to progressive scan.  They implied I was imagining the problems.

I went to Invision Opotometry, where they were able to make glasses that work.  They inspected the glasses from LensCrafters and found that the axial tilt was 8 degrees out alignment.

But, my insurance expired while I was working with LensCrafters to try and fix the issue.  The insurance would have paid for a new pair if LensCrafters were in network, but since they're out of network the insurance couldn't do anything.

LensCrafters is willing to pay me back my copayment for the glasses they botched, but I'm out more than double that in what I had to pay for the replacement glasses.

Lesson learned; stick to legitimate optometrists and stay away from LensCrafters.

Edit:  LensCrafters has responded, asking me to fill out a customer care form.  But, I've already gone through that process and the only response I got was to go back to the store.  Whoever was handling the form was completely disinterested in providing any assistance beyond what the store gave.  It turned into a game passing the buck from store to corporate and back to store.<//text><Date>1583196515202< /Date>< GmapID>

Review from Alecsandra Howell. I saw dr. Robert Gentile for an eye exam and contacts. He prescribed a newer, better contact lens. I developed Giant Papillary Conjunctivitis and was very uncomfortable. I went to my primary care and an eye doctor he recommended, ends up dr. Robert Gentile prescribed the wrong type of new contacts for me, a much harder lens. I returned one year supply contact lenses unopened a week ago, on 11.15.19. One year supply of contacts was over $600 including the insurance. I still do not have the refund (a week later, electronic refund should not take more than 24 hours). I called multiple times the Escondido store, spoke to Nicole and Tammy, they were not able to call me back and let me know refund status. I am wondering how many other customers are treated like this and don't even check status of their refund. How many customers are prescribed the wrong contacts and end up with eye infection as I did. Please do not use their services.<//review>

<review>The exam was professional. The fitting went well. Then it went down hill.  The lens were canceled multiple times for reasons no one could explain. There were no proactive phones calls or followup.  I had to call for updates and amazingly after a 3 week delay the associate that I had talked with multiple time did not even offer an apology when I picked up the order.
Sadly I have purchased glasses multiple times in the past. but after this experience I will be taking my business else where.< /review><resp>{'time': 1566246867346, 'text': 'Hi Mike, thanks for your review.

< Review>
Although the store is smaller than normal lenscrafters (it is inside a mall) the staff are much better than some of the other locations I have been to. The optometrist was very knowledgeable and explained to me what he was doing (when I asked) since he did more tests than just the normal "looking at blurry letters" test. The rest of the staff were helpful when deciding what to buy - since my last ones broke they told me things that my previous locations SHOULD have told me. One of the better stores I have been to.</Review>

<text>As far as staffing goes Iike the folks at this place.They're patient and listen to me to get my frames to fit how I need them to fit.

Teion is my favorite, I have a hard time getting anything to fit right but he seems to read my mind when I feel like I'm not explaining it right. Eerie but thank goodness he gets it!!!< /text>< Date>

(Translated by Google) Hello, I highly recommend this place. It has excellent customer service, in my case it is the first time that I make a purchase of prescription glasses so I did not even know what was going on, but I was fortunate to meet Alma manager of the store, who helped me a lot in all my doubts, and most importantly it helped me to obtain what I really wanted. Thank you!!

<review>A proper experience for adults who enjoy the downtown community in Sacramento, or for those visiting at the nearby Kimpton Sawyer. You can't go wrong with any choice from the tacos and large craft beer selection. There's no excuse not to smile while playing underground, hiding from the summer heat, and playing one of the adult sized games solo or with others. I know that Sacramento has nothing like it and neither does South Lake Tahoe...which is why you should take your Duffleboard hustle or putting skills to the new location there this summer, and be on the right side of history! :)<//review>< Pictures>

Went there with my wife and friends and really loved it. Great beer selection and decent premixed drinks. DUFFLEBOARD was so much fun, also have Jenga and minigolf. Really liked the vibe here.</Text>

Awesome new bar in DOCO!!! Loved the mini golf and duffle board courses. Tacos were bomb and there were a ton of delicious local beers on tap. The bartenders in the Trophy Club upstairs mixed up a perfect old fashioned. Can’t wait to go back!!!</review>

Had so much fun here with my husband for date night. We enjoyed tacos and nachos from the bar and watched some of the Kings game here.  The food was delicious and we noticed they had vegan food too. It’s so hard to find vegan food sometimes when we hang out with our best friend couple to appease their appetite  and our meat loving appetite at the same time I’m so happy to know we can bring them here for a fun night out. We played duffle board and mini golf and I won at both 😉 there’s a photo booth  ( that takes card !😍 and emails you a copy and a video clip as well as two hard copies!) There was corn hole and a version of giant Jenga. This place is seriously the best. Art on the walls, fun light bright signs too! Like beer ? They have an amazing amount of beer on tap with most of it being local breweries and great prices. Nothing was over the top in pricing, which you know we all can appreciate ! We were able to visit the speakeasy Trophy Club that’s hidden upstairs and it’s so lush and gorgeous, here we tasted delicious cocktails that were definitely to our standards I’d love to visit the trophy club on another date night it was cozy  with the right lighting and the velvet chairs are so beautiful. I ended up getting the flat stick hoodie they had for sale downstairs in the pub and it’s seriously the comfiest sweater I own. We will definitely be frequenting this place often! So happy to have them be apart of Sacramento !<//review>

<Name>Katie Coolidge< /Name><Review>This place is great!! There's a 9 hole mini golf course that's Sacramento themed. They also have a course for a game called Duffelboard, which is like the love child of mini golf, shuffleboard, and billiards. I went on a weeknight for an event, so it wasn't too crowded. I can't speak for weekends, but it's definitely worth checking out for the food and beer. They have some solid tacos and nachos, along with a fabulous selection of local beers.<//Review><user>108590606965360603891<//user>< resp>

I had no clue what shuffleboard was until I saw it here and can now say it's pretty cool. For those who don't know, it's like mini golf with a small hand held putter that you use to hit the golf ball into a hole. Lots of fun! The entire drink menu is locally sourced from NorCal breweries and wineries and everything is great. Overall a cool place on DOCO<//review>

Was a bit disappointed. The bartenders were also giving out the balls for the mini golf, so it was a long wait to get a drink. Get a beer in my hand and I can wait all day!

The course itself was too cramped for me. I guess I'm used to 'real' mini golf not drinking mini golf. Don't come expecting a super fun course. The one through the Tower bridge was fun.

Not sure if I'll go again. Maybe on a Tuesday when it's not so busy< /text>

Our tee time was not reserved as discussed. We were told they have a full bar, but they do not. The only liquor they have is awful overpriced premixed cocktails - no shots, doubles, etc. Then to top it off, we were told that the priority bar service cost extra, despite the website stating that it is included with our room reservation.

Waited a bit to post my review after coming in a few times, but now I can happily say that this place is a winner! The food has been consistently good for me (get the barbacoa nachos!) and I love the fact that the beers and ciders are all local. The games are pretty challenging.. aka I didn't do very well, but it only makes me want to keep trying and get better! Great service and a fun atmosphere.. I'm looking forward to trying more new beers and upping my duffleboard skills soon!<//review>

Wanted to love this place, but we hosted a company event and did not have a pleasant experience.  With a reserved/paid space, a server should be provided.  Our entire party had to order drinks at a very packed, understaffed bar.  We asked the Manager if we could have the leftover taco bar packed up and he literally pointed to the to-go boxes across the room.  When we asked for bags to carry the food out, he rummaged up a single Panera bag.  We won't be back.<//Review>

We strive for excellent customer service and it's clear we fell very short.\n\nFlatstick Pub is server-less and this should have been made more clear during your booking process.\nThe reserved party rooms give your group 1/2 off golf and duffleboard™. They are priced so it financially works out in your favor as the paid reservation and the discounted games is cheaper than not booking a space.\n\nWe do offer larger spaces with priority bar access to make getting a drink quicker on busier nights.\n\nWhile our server-less atmosphere is a bit modern, we should have brought the to-go boxes over to you and not simply pointed.\n\nAgain, we are sorry for your poor experience and we hope you're able to give us another chance in the future. We're still new and learning and getting better every day."}< /Response>< gmapID>

What an awesome place!! Great location right in the DOCO area. Stumbled upon this place while visiting Sacremento and had so much fun. The Duffleboard is unique and passed the time! The nachos and burrito were delicious and beer selection was excellent and full of local beers. Next time I’m back look forward to figuring out a way into the Trophy Club—</review>

Awesome little venue to host a party, or maybe go on a date. Not so much to just drop in on your own. If prices were half as much, I'd give 4stars. If they had a full bar, as well, I'd give 5stars.< /review>

Chill spot to hang, eat and drink. Went on a Friday night and it wasn't packed which was nice. If you're planning to putt though, check in, then grab your food and drinks because there can be a wait time. Duffleboard is relatively easy to play though.</Text>

Looks can be deceiving from the outside Flatstick looks small with its double doors facing DOCO until you walk downstairs and realize it’s a half city block wide.  No joke, 1/2 a city block long and a Starbucks, TMobile, the entire friggin building wide.

This is one of the biggest bar / pubs in Sacramento.

Awesome nachos and tacos.  They have  taco Tuesday that goes all day and night!  2 tacos and a beer for $10!!!  In DOCO.

Indoor mini-golf is really cool and ask about the secret members only lounge Trophy Club upstairs.  This place will not disappoint.  This is a must visit in Sacramento.<//review>

If you decide to get a bite to eat, try the carnitas or barbacoa tacos. They also have Cornhole and jiant Jenga here!< /review><time>1583192656841</time>< username>

<Text>If you are into craft beer and over priced food this is your spot. Golf and duffle board are pay to play games kind of on the pricy side. Food is good but taste like Chipotle. Good for the younger privileged crowd. Not a bar environment. No cash accepted<//Text>< pics>

We’ve worked hard to make our food both affordable and delicious.\n\nGolf is $12 per round and Duffleboard is $9, we also offer $3 off per game anytime before 6pm and a membership that gives you unlimited games for life. We’re actually much cheaper than other mini golf bars we’ve seen so we apologize if this was a sub-par experience for you.\n\nWe also just opened yesterday, so we apologize if we’re still working out some kinks. We’d love to have you back to make the experience right. Shoot an email to hello@tipsyputt.com.'}< /Resp><GmapID>0x809ad1555f17fb9f:0x52bd7c76594e4c1c< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

For a while this location was 5 stars. Amazing flavor for chicken and even the chips. Not sure what happened, maybe a few of the cooks left. Pure speculation; however, the food has become bland. All the ingredients are cooked to perfection. It just doesn't have good seasoning. Also unsure if they season on site or if it comes pre seasoned. Wishing the flavor train can return soon.< /Review>

Really upset with my experience . . . I ordered 2 bowls and 1 kids meal . . . While eating my bowl I found a piece of plastic!!!!! WTH!!! Imagine if it would've came out in my son's food!!! Any one of us could've choked on it . . . Employees need to pay more attention!!! The only number there is to complain is the store number and they are closed already so I felt I had to put my complaint here, really??? 🤷‍♀️ And the survey is only to win free Chipotle 🤦‍♀️</text>

Actually (and in comparison with the other reviewers here) I have no complaints.

I had no issues with wait time, and my food is tasty.
Got the Veggie Tacos as you can see, side chips/salsa 👍<//Text>

Really good options if you're vegan or vegetarian, and it's reasonably priced.  You can get a burrito bowl or burrito for under 8 dollars I think, if you don't get the guacamole 🥑.< /Review>

I visit the LaBrea and Centinela all the time. There is a beautiful African American young lady that's always there at night with the most beautiful spirit and calm about her. I surely don't mind ever spending my money there. I did compliment her the last time I was there. If only all customer service could be that way. Sorry I forgot her name and I was so late in writing this post. Thank you young lady. Keep up the wonderful work❤<//Text>

These people gave me half a scoop of rice, half a scoop a chicken. I ask politely for more chicken... they say it’s double. Ridiculous. Lost a customer..and a loyal one at that. Beware of gettin ripped off here</text>

Yesterday was the first time in this fine restaurant. But It is absolutely not the last. We passed a splendid evening with the good service, with the fine cooking and booze and with the friendly price. We will surely go back there soon.< /Review>

<text>I'm a regular, they are always friendly and the chicken at this location is especially tasty and juicy. I wish the packaging for Chipotle as whole was better. The bowls just cant hold up.

Editing my review after today's experience..I don't know if COVID-19 is the culprit, but I come
here pretty regularly and they recently started calling out prices or charging for like a side of pico. Which is weird. Sometimes I go big and get alot of stuff and sometimes I just want to minimize carbs so chicken and rice with a side a pico is my go to. But today was really strange the woman was all tight faced and just tossed my pico into my bag, I guess because I forgot to order the pico in the beginning..She says oh now its a bowl I'm like huh? Thats new. I always get pico and its never been a bowl..I came in a few days ago and got a quesadilla but added corn and beans..He says we have to charge for a burrito. I'm thinking okay Why is this being announced I normally just order and pay. Never considered the price but if the toppings are no longer free like salsa they should put a sign up and leave it at that,why mess up the experience talking about prices..< /text>< pictures>

Why aren't quesadillas available on the online ordering menu? It's been months. Otherwise for most part service is good. But this is frustrating cuz that's all my kids like but they want the adult size.</review>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Text>This is the most unprofessional chipotle I’ve ever revisited . The food is not cooked constantly and the employees are not attentive and if I told you how poorly the meals are prep via online orders . My friend even ordered food and they gave her food away to the wrong delivery person and refused to deal with it .  Not sure they understand what good customer service is .< /Text></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
We just had two Seperate orders from this restaurant in the past two hours. Upon eating the food. Two of us in the office vomited and the third is not feeling well and had to get sent home. When customer support was called all they could do is refund %15 of the order instead of actually taking action.</Review>

<Text>Waited for 20 min in the urgent care... only for them to tell me they COULDN’T see me!!!

Why did they make me wait for 20 min?! they should of just told me to not wait! And I walked in at 6:56pm when they close at 8pm (that’s a whole hour earlier!) might as well put that they close at 7pm if they don’t have enough staff! Worst urgent care ever, never coming here again and don’t recommend you coming here if you’re thinking about it!

I only came here for the convenience, it’s the closest one to my house, but my mistake I’ll drive longer to another one where they can actually take me in and have enough staff! And I recommend you do the same unless you want/can “come here earlier and wait the whole day”.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<Review>I just received my first coronavirus vaccine shot here today. The staff was professional and friendly. I was impressed how they serve the community including those who don't speak english, and the homeless community. They are a non-profit organization and the local community clearly benefits from their presence here.</Review>< Pictures>

I drove from el cajon, I was on time exactly, for my APPOINTMENT and they tried to tell me I was late by 6 minutes and so they were not going to see me for a physical, but they could see me for something else.

So bad. Don't go to Logan. They are way too slow. I have been here 3 plus hours and staff keeps saying you are next as it seems the  only doctor here goes from one room to the next when I am.
supposedly next. Unacceptable... "Urgent Care". "Where nothing is urgent". To them...< /Review>

<rate>1</rate><review>Celeste Hernandez the prenatal case manager is rude and impatient. I tried explaining that I would have to call back to reschedule and instead she raised her voice and said some snarky remarks in regards to my pregnancy case. If I didn’t care for my pregnancy I wouldn’t be trying to manage work and making money along with my appointments. Never going to Logan Heights clinic ever again because of her. In the end she hung up because I asked her why she was having an attitude with me for not being able to schedule right in that moment. I hope no mother dealing with pregnancy or financial hardships ever receive bad treatment on top of what they’re already dealing with. Don’t need that stress for our babies!<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>{'time': 1611248043562, 'text': 'Hi Gabby,\nPregnancy is a challenging time—there is so much to balance.

<text>Really bad mental service. They won’t schedule you until months in advance and they have really rude mental health counseling.

Go somewhere else I’ve tried this place for a whole year and all they have to say is “sorry about that”. Literally 5 of my appointments had to be rescheduled for the next month because the doctor was “sick” or not in the office.

Trash service especially Maria Mendez<//text>< Pictures>

<Text>we wait EXTRA 30 minutes for our appointment and they don't care but when we are late they reschedule the whole appointment. when you come here you do nothing but wait. When I ask the reason for my wait they don't have any answer. No one knows what they are doing. Someone needs to do something. They took us in and we wait 2 MORE hours. That's not fair.</Text>< pics>

<Text>For women's health, they are usually on it with follow ups &needs, they have a very good program BUT the waiting to be seen is horrible!! If you got an appointment, make sure you have time that day! Each appointment wait time is an hour and a half. Just to see the doctor or health staff for only 15min. I have timed my visits and each averages 1hr and 30min of waiting. And an extra 25min to see a case manager to schedule the next visit.< /Text><time>1593286251575< /time><user_id>108560241514081917586< /user_id>< Rate>

<Review>Honestly don't even bother showing up to this place. First of all they'll make you wait way too long and don't properly prioritize their patients. If you're sick, you're better off going to an emergency room, since you're gonna wait at least 2-3 hours anyways so might as well do it in a real hospital which might be better staffed.
They might be nice and educated but that's of no use if they're making each patient wait for as long as a motion picture movie. It makes no sense, if only I'd known I would've never come here. The only reason I did come was because the walk-ins were full in spring valley. This place is a shame to urgent care clinics. The staff is as slow as can be. I can't reiterate enough, do not bring your business here.< /Review></record>

< Review>
I am extremely disappointed. With an appointment I still waited almost 2 hours to be seen while multiple walk ins were admitted. It’s a shame because the dental staff does a good job once you’re in a room but the wait time is unacceptable. Communication is a weakness with the staff and patients.< /Review>

Terrible. They checked me in - made me wait over an hour then said "it's closing time, sorry can't see you." What's the meaning of urgent then? Just tell me, and I'll be on my way to get care somewhere else!< /review>

<Text>I went back to get my glasses, because the first time I had a wonderful experience, so now I had them done here again and I will continue to come back because they are very courteous, friendly, professional and pretty fast assisting their patients. I recommend everyone to get their health issues taken care at this clinic.<//Text>< user_name>

<text>I am surprised by the reviews on here. My boyfriend is stationed in san diego so we made a rush move out here with my daughter. I still have out of state insurance so we were having some trouble finding a place to take my child who was having respiratory problems. As soon as we walked through the door a busy man, I believe his name was Jorge, downstairs stopped everything and asked what we needed. He walked us upstairs to urgent care and came back up with his info to assist me with getting coverage here. Another lady helped us and she was extremely helpful, taking us down to pediatrics, speaking to registration there, and getting us papers. There were no appointments downstairs as we came right near close, but the urgent care made time for us. Registrar's were all kind and the doctor was thorough, informative, gentle and nice. They were closing and they didn't rush through my daughters care, which my boyfriend and I greatly appreciated. Another perk is that view from the urgent care😉 Overall, clean, quick care, thorough examination, and friendly workers who went over and beyond for us. Thank you Logan Heights ! We will be back😁<//text><GmapID>0x80d9536bcea8ca03:0x1a4a23d2b152c636<//GmapID>< Name>

We have since implemented an electronic system our vision staff can use to monitor patient arrival times. This ensures patients are seen in order of arrival unless there are emergency circumstances. For the most expedient service, the system also separates patients with appointments for vision tests from those only picking up glasses. We appreciate you sharing your feedback and look forward to providing you exceptional care in the future.'}</Response>

I went to pick up my eye glasses and it took 20 minutes for me to get them. I had paid for them and was made to wait. When I did get them there was a 20 second interaction between me and the person who gave them to me. They also helped out a person before me who came after me to also pick up glasses. Some doctors are amazing, the receptionist staff is rude and speak to each other loudly about non work stuff. I would recommend the city college family health over this location. The staff is always rude and it makes the whole experience bad.< /Review>

Yesterday friday the 9th I was scheduled for a ultrasound and the Asia lady that did it was being really rude and aggressive towards the fact that my baby didn’t turn the way she wanted him to do and she would jiggle my stomach hard to the point that as today Saturday the 10 my stomach feels like if I was bruised up. She was really rude and when she wiped the gel she did it aggressively< /text>

The worst place ever, Especially the woman clinic  building
The doctors and staffs are very rude with zero  humanities.
My mom had appointment today at 3 pm We arrived at 3 pm.  I know we supposed to arrive earlier but we were confused with  buildings anyway She checked in and they asked her to wait for her turn.
She waited 30 minutes then they called her in. And when we got inside of the patient room. The nurse told her the doctor can’t see today we have to  schedule you for other day because you arrived late !!  And I told her what you talking about ?? Her about at 3pm and we arrived at 3 o’clock . She said Yes but her Checking times was 2:45
I told her we came from far away could you plz help us out
She like: No I can’t with very rude attitude
I’m: why then you guys keep her waiting 30 minutes for no reason ?? you could just told her that from the beginning instead of wasting our times
She said sorry the doctor want it to be like that
Anyway the clinic was very bad and the staff there wasn’t professional
And honestly I feel myself Like I was at the border not in USA</review>

Wait time. Unreal! A 2:30 appointment means I'll probably be seen by 3:30.
The Staff. The office staff seemed to be friendly and very helpful.
The nurses and medical staff are beyond Super Slow and Super LAZY!
But they still operate with the same belittling arrogance of the 3 docs that didnt help me.

<text>I came to change my review, after a year of my child attending this clinic, it completely went from good to bad, then really bad... We never got to see the doctor I choose. She was never there, and had just replacement doctors, that somehow gave us a attitudes when we asked for my childs doctor.
Don't waist your time here, take your child somewhere else.< /text>< Rate>

App at 11:10. I get there early. Did normal stuff and placed in room. 45 mins later I leave. Didn't see the doc. I have better things to do than wait an hour without them saying anything to me. I left without a word. Maybe they can learn from that. Did get a call but I don't answer phone calls. The doc left a message asking me to come back... Lol really? You had your chance and lost it. First and last time I'll ever be there.</Text>

{'time': 1527607109904, 'text': 'Hi Carla –\n\nAs a community health center we work hard to increase access to care. Some of our locations are open on Saturdays or have extended hours during the week. We do recognize and close for most major holidays. We’re surprised to hear that your insurance company required you to have the prescription filled at our pharmacy, as we have relationships with dozens of pharmacies in the region, many that operate 24/7. In order to provide you with excellent customer service, we need more information about your visit and about the type of insurance you have. It is very uncommon for an insurance plans to only allow prescriptions to be filled at one pharmacy and we would like to investigate this matter further. We would even be happy to contact your insurance company on your behalf. Please contact Clinic Director, Jessica Guevara, at jguevara@fhcsd.org. We greatly appreciate your feedback.'}</response>

< Review>
It took a month to get and appointment, they called me a month later to tell me that there's no appointments for my referral and would call me back when they would get one. Once in doctors office. It took 30 mins for doctor to come in room! 😡 After an hour wait in lobby.< /Review>

< review>
Logan Heights Clinic-This has been by far the worst medical experience of my life, starting with the administrative personnel (Jorge and Andres)who are supposed to help you process your medical insurance, I began my application process in early September and still as of today December 8th I still do not have approval! I've turned in the same documents 4 times because they keep loosing them or not uploading them to where they have to be.I had an emergency surgery last week and I was signing and submitting insurance documents 2 min before I had my anesthesia because my insurance is not yet active after 90 days! Then Yesterday I go to my one week post surgery follow up appointment and the Doctor In the Women's Clinic didn't even have my medical records and was not aware Of my procedure or  the Medications I was taking I had to tell her my self what the surgery was about and the types of medications I was taking, I had called several days before coming in to confirm everything was set for my appointment and that my medical file would be available to follow up on any medications/recommendations from the doctors, turns out  after I threw a huge tantrum and started crying out of frustration Dr. Laughlerd saw how agitated I was and searched  for my record,  my file was in the case managers desk and was never uploaded to the system so doctors had no access to my information for follow up. The service here is horrible employees have no ethics and should not be working in the medical/service industry. I have tried to go to a new clinic several times and they have not sent the referral for this to happen, unfortunately I have a high risk pregnancy and on top of this I have to be dealing with their negligence every time I go from the Admin personnel to the women's clinic. Stay away from here.</review>

<text>This is the worst clinic I have ever been to tried it out had about 5 visits each visit was a disappointment. I dont know how they hire people but sure they hire people that dont know what the heck they are doing. So i got to the adult clinic they call me into the room i wait for almost an hour Dr comes in youre ready to go and hand me a prescription that was not mine! And i had not even seen the doctor yet ! Crazy! Another appt the Dr didnt prescribe all of my medications gave a call left my name and number and info never recieved a call back. Today they scheduled me for depo shot i was there for an hour for them to tell me they should have called me a day ahead that it was not time for my shot when they are the ones who scheduled me so basically she tells me come back after 2/4/18 im like im already here i already got time off work to come here why cant i just get it done today she said no, that i can talk to administration really!!!< /text>< response>

<review>The front desk staff and the medical assistant staff act careless, clueless, and not prepare with patients, and even if you have an appointment,  they make you wait more than an hour just to get in the room, then once you are in the romos they make you wait long time before get seen by a doctor that is not wearing batch or ID that confirm she is a pediatrician. They make sure you have a horrible experience in the clinic. They seem not trustworthy.<//review><user>107911289776494891328< /user>< pics>

<Review>One of the gynecologists in there traumatized me. I have never had a bad experience with any of the doctors in there until Dr's Tueros. I told her that I haven't been able to get pregnant after trying it for a long time and all she did, is giving me attitude and prescribing me condoms. I was in shock when I went to the pharmacy and found out that my prescription were condoms. She saw me how concerned and terrified I was for not being able to conceive. She didnt even send me for an ultrausand or nothing.What is her problem?!! This happened twice with her; the first time I thought it was part of going to see a gynecologist regarding the reason, until I asked another Dr. I just can't believe it, Dr's Tueros is an unhappy and rude human being.
I'm not going to generalize the bad experience that I had with Dr. Tueros with the clinic because I've been going to that clinic for years and I know there are other doctors in there that are good but just be very careful who do you go to!< /Review><Rating>2</Rating><Name>Laura Sanchez<//Name>< UserId.>

I cane back at 12:30 and still 1 hour and 1/2 later i was finally in, but! The doctor still didnt show up for about 40 minsand still nothing it was 2:13 and i asked if the doctor was around and they said he was they just said they were started late and it bothered me that they were on their phones looking at youtube video's. Unfortunately i had to leave because it was just ridiculous for me to have kept waiting and didn't want my fionce to be late fkr wok.

We further understand that we are not the worst clinic, but we understand a wait time beyond one’s appointment time can be frustrating. Unfortunately, your pediatrician had to see a newborn baby who had some unusual needs—this put her behind schedule. What your pediatrician gave to the newborn is the same type of attention you would want your child to receive if they presented with a critical need.

Since you were still in the clinic when you posted your comment online, Associate Director Fabian Martinez was able to come out and speak with you directly. I know he explained that the Urgent Care clinic had two significant emergency cases that day and it resulted in your longer than normal wait time. We try to take patients in the order that they arrive, but because the level of urgency varies between patients, we have to rely on our trained medical provider’s judgment to first treat those whose condition might become critical if we didn’t act quickly. Mr. Martinez said that you were very gracious and understood the situation and we appreciate your patience. If you have any further concerns to share, you may contact our Clinic Director, Jessica Guevara, at jguevara@fhcsd.org. Thank you.'}<//response>

If you don't have medical insurance this clinic is an inexpensive alternative, although if you need to see a specialist, all they do is refer you to another doctor in private practice, tell them that you have no insurance hoping that they'll discount their prices, and keep the $35.00 they charged you for the office visit.< /review>

<gmapID>0x80d9536bcea8ca03:0x1a4a23d2b152c636<//gmapID><Review>(Translated by Google) Today I went to this clinic and had a terrible experience. I went in to get a COVID-19 vaccine at this location since I have a panic disorder and they normally do it outside. Since it was scheduled to rain today, when I arrived I found out it would be indoors last minute. They said it was best I rescheduled because they did not have time to observe me outside after the vaccine was administered (15 min). There were plenty of nurses with barely any patients in line and it was not raining at all during this time. I took time off work to try to get the vaccine, and also picked a day when someone was available to accompany me (due to the panic disorder). Therefore, it is not easy for me to come in and get the health care I need. It is very unfortunate that mental illness does not get the same treatment. It would be nice if your clinic would be better equipped to serve EVERYONE, including people with disabilities, both mental and physical. I'm sure it's rare people need accommodations, maybe 1 out of the 50 people you see all day? Also, what if people don't have the resources to keep coming back until the weather changes? Could you not just have certain staff help those who might need physical or mental accommodations due to disabilities? What's more unfortunate is that there is no one you can really speak to about this matter, because the very own Director of the vaccination site is the one telling you to come back another day. It is very clear this clinic does not care about mental health nor treats mental illness equally.

Today I went to this clinic and had a terrible experience. I went in to get the COVID-19 vaccine in this place since I have a panic disorder and they usually do it outside. How it was scheduled to rain today, when I arrived I found out it would be inside the building last minute. They said it was better for me to come back because they didn't have time to observe me outside after I was given the vaccine (15 min). There were many nurses with almost no patients in line and it did not rain at all during this time. I took time from work to try to get the vaccine and also chose a day when someone was available to accompany me (due to panic disorder). Therefore, it is not easy for me to go in and get the medical attention that I need. It is very unfortunate that mental illness does not receive the same treatment. It would be nice if your clinic was better equipped to assist EVERYONE, including people with disabilities, both mental and physical. Also, what if people don't have the resources to keep coming back until the weather changes? Couldn't you just have certain staff help people who might need physical and mental adaptations due to disabilities? What is more regrettable is that there is no one with whom you can really talk about this matter, because the Director of the vaccination site herself is the one who tells you to come back another day. It is very clear that this clinic does not care about mental health or treat mental illnesses equally.

Hoy fui a esta clínica y tuve una experiencia terrible. Entré para ponerme la vacuna COVID-19 en este lugar ya que tengo un trastorno de pánico y normalmente lo hacen afuera. Cómo estaba programado para llover hoy, cuando llegué me enteré de que sería en el interior del edificio último minuto. Dijeron que era mejor que regresara porque no tenían tiempo de observarme afuera después de que me administraran la vacuna (15 min). Había muchas enfermeras con casi ningún paciente en la fila y no llovió en absoluto durante este tiempo. Me tomé tiempo del trabajo para tratar de ponerme la vacuna y también elegí un día en el que alguien estaba disponible para acompañarme (debido al trastorno de pánico). Por lo tanto, no es fácil para mí entrar y obtener la atención médica que necesito. Es muy lamentable que las enfermedades mentales no reciban el mismo tratamiento. Sería bueno que su clínica estuviera mejor equipada para asistir a TODOS, incluidas las personas con discapacidades, tanto mentales como físicas. Además, ¿qué pasa si las personas no tienen los recursos para seguir regresando hasta que cambie el clima? ¿No podría simplemente hacer que cierto personal ayude a las personas que podrían necesitar adaptaciones físicas y mentales debido a discapacidades? Lo que es más lamentable es que no hay nadie con quien realmente puedas hablar sobre este asunto, porque la propia Directora del sitio de vacunación es la que te dice que regreses otro día. Está muy claro que está clínica no se preocupa por la salud mental ni trata las enfermedades mentales por igual.< /Review><UserId.>106623766997446163048</UserId.>< username>

(Translated by Google) I didn't like how my dad was treated. I don't know if the Doctor was upset. But the way I talk to my dad I didn't like it. You have to have empathy and patience and tact to talk with patients, the nurses who were very friendly but I do not return to that place

All of our non-medical staff members are provided reusable cloth masks to ensure they are also protected, both when interacting with patients and each other. We do not allow certain masks in our clinics, particularly those with valves on the front, because they may keep germs from getting in, but they do not stop them from getting out.

(Translated by Google) So far I have done well with this clinic. It has ample parking and people are friendly from the Women's clinic. I have taken my pregnancy there from the beginning and I have not had failures. When I speak to communicate or when I have doubts about my appointments they mark me again. In the laboratory the people who have touched me draw blood are good at doing so and very friendly. The reason why I give it 4 stars is that they have already re-sent me my appointments with different people for ex. Dr. or the nutritionist and don't let me know that I have to re-standardize. I only realize that that day I supposedly have a framework appointment to confirm; and he tells me that there is no appointment for that day and that I have to re-add. And then one asks for work permission to attend the appointment and to be rescheduled without knowing because it is a little bit of money. But if I give it a 4 star it's just that detail of the reagendadas appointments.

(Original)
hasta ahorita me ha ido bien con esta clínica. Tiene amplia estacionamiento y las personas son amables de la clínica de la Mujer. He llevado mi embarazo ahi desde el principio y no he tenido fallas. Cuando hablo para comunicarme o cuando tengo dudas de mis citas me vuelven a marcar. En el laboratorio las personas que me han tocado sacarme sangre son buenos al hacerlo y muy amables.  La razón por la cual le doy 4 estrellas es que ya van 2 veces que me reagendan mi citas con diferentes personas ej. Dr. o la nutriologa y no me avisan que tengo que reagendar. Solo me doy cuenta que ese mero día que supuestamente tengo cita marco para confirmar; y me dice que no hay cita para ese dia y que tengo que reagendar. Y pues uno pide permiso del trabajo para asistir a la cita y que te la reagenden sin saber pues esta un poco canijo. Pero si le doy un 4 estrellas solo es ese detalle de las citas reagendadas.</review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Very bad organization and very bad service. We went to the clinic 🏥 and I noticed that several people including us, it took us a long time to go to the clinic and the most recent patients passed before. I went and asked at the reception why were they doing that? And they just said it's according to the doctor they assigned you and how long it takes with each patient. The correct thing is that when a doctor is vacated right there they pass to the patient who follows immediately. They do not deserve any stars 🌟 but I will be generous and I will give them one only because the price 💵 of the consultations is very accessible for those who do not have medical insurance.

(Original)
Muy mala organización y malísimo servicio. Fuimos a la clínica 🏥 y noté que varias personas incluyendonos nosotros, tardamos demasiado en entrar a consulta y los pacientes mas recientes pasaron antes. Fui y pregunté en la recepción ¿porqué estaban haciendo eso? Y sólo dijeron que es según el médico que te asignaron y cuanto tarde con cada paciente. Lo correcto es que cuando se desocupe un médico ahí mismo pasen al paciente que sigue inmediatamente. No merecen ninguna estrella 🌟 pero seré generosa y les voy a dar una sólo porque el precio 💵 de las consultas es muy accesible para los que no tenemos seguro médico.</Review>< resp>

(Translated by Google) It is a clinic, I was not well attended to by the truth, and because of my guilt I lost my first baby, I told them I had pain, I told them I do not feel like a canzo, I will leave pain, do not worry, it is not a star

(Translated by Google) I am the first time I come and they did not want to attend me because I have to arrive 15 minutes before to register that because they put them at the exact time.

Angelica was awesome! Not only was she personable, but she also ensured the safety of both of us and helped me find the best pair of glasses. In addition, the Dr. made the experience of reading lines and counting 1 or 2 fun.</Review>

<review>My appointment was great. The only issue I was not pleased with is the amount of time it is going to take to get my two new pair of glasses. I have always used Lens Crafters even though you are about 20% higher in cost than most other companies because I could get my glasses the same day in one hour. Your staff waited until after I paid over $500.00 for my glasses to tell me it would take 3 weeks to get them. You should be telling EVERYONE this before they even start the appointment.<//review><Response>None< /Response><pictures>None< /pictures><username>Joe Gosser</username>< user_id>

<text>it was probably the best experience I haveever had with an optometrist. I am going to require cataract surgery and the doctor told me what to expect and some advice on choices to be made about the surgery. I thought this as above and beyond a normal appointment.< /text>< user_name>

<review>It was a great experience. I was seen right away. The staff were very helpful, especially Valerie, who helped me tremendously. The doctor went through all of the tests and explained them to me. He was very thorough and patient. I strongly recommend Eyexam.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x80e9ad4f26498b5f:0xda72e1a27cbe4f1< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Oh my gosh! My husband is Hispanic and very selective about his food.  As for my own tastes, I am a foodie!  I LOVE creative food that is prepared and presented with imagination.
I ordered cauliflower tacos and they were INCREDIBLE.  Best part was, I asked the server to pick three tacos for my husband who is "old school" and he loved every one of them!
This will be the place I go to for Mexican food from this day forward!</text>

I had the fajita quesadilla. Mouth watering. It was so good. My friend got the shrimp tacos. Even though I don't eat those, they looked amazing. The chips and salsa were very tasty. I would go back.</Text>

<Review>This restaurant is my preferred one. I visit a lot of restaurants but to this one I  constantly return again and again. The stuff is very attentive and the cooking they place on your table is so tasty. I never decline to have a good meal in this restaurant. I recommend this place with pleasure.<//Review>< Date>

I frequent this marvelous  place every couple of days  as I love the  special atmosphere that is part of this place. The staff is highly welcoming and professional. The service is absolutely rapid. Not to mention, the food they serve is excellent. I ate there many times and I was always happy. The expense is modest. I highly recommend this place to all my friends.</review>

<Text>Absolute best service. Fantastic food. Also there was a discrepancy with my dads order, and not only was the meal replaced but we were able to keep the replaced plate. Extremely courteous and professional. Very clean environment, I believe the manager was out in the restaurant floor cleaning and making sure everything was attended to. Definitely going back again.<//Text><Name>Joshua Palafox< /Name><Pictures>None<//Pictures></record>

< Review>
Cabo taco is always a go to in la mirada. They are always friendly and have pretty good food. I do like the fact that they normally have specials which are new and off menu. Gives you something to try when you are a regular.  The salsa is very good. Shrimp tacos are good. The enchiladas are really cheesy. Chile rellanos have good flavor and the pozole is good as well. Spicy.<//Review>

<Review>First time here, we stopped in to grab a bite to eat before heading into the movie just next door and I must say..the food was pretty darn tasty. The food came out very fast freshly made, the tacos were amazing. Our waitress checked on us plenty of times as we were out on the patio out of sight. When it was time to check out she made sure to ask if we were going to the theater's, I was unaware if you are they give you 15% off your bill....that was awesome!!! I'll be back.!!< /Review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80dd2b687cc93753:0x56213ba0dd8d7ea</gmapID></record>

Love this place. The owner, can't remember his name, is very attentive. He knows his patrons by name. I've been there a handful of times and just moved back to the area. Will definitely be returning.< /Text>

two days ago was the first time we visited this place. But It is no doubt not the last time. We passed a splendid evening with the attentive service, with the great  meal and fine drinks and with the modest charge. We will definitely visit there again.<//Text>

<Text>Love this place. They have all these little twists on standard Mexican food that make this menu pretty unique.  Once a month they also prepare a completely off menu dinner that is paired up with beer selections from local craft breweries. I've done this twice now and it really is a well done and unique experience. I believe this is the third Thursday of every month, but call ahead to confirm, and also to find out which brewery they are teaming up with.  It's also right next to the budget theater, so it's easy to pop in for a few beers and complimentary chips and salsa before your movie.<//Text>< Response>

<Review>Unique and Huge flavored foods. All fresh including the delicious salsa. The staff are friendly and their quick service is amazing. You will not leave here hungry. Their portions are nice and big but not over done. The owner is always walking around and loves talking to his patrons. A 5 star for sure!< /Review>< gmapID>

Probably the worst Mexican food I've ever had. The guacamole was watered down. Our food had zero flavor besides it being spicy. Definitely not going back. Service was really good! Our waiter was amazing..too bad the food sucked.<//text>

Good food, decent service, but a bit slow and mixed up.  Enjoyed my meal, but our party of 11 didn't all get served anywhere close to the same time.  I'm wondering if our experience would have been a bit better had our party been smaller.  Would probably try it again if back in that neighborhood.</text>

Their tacos are really good and big!  My favorites are the carnitas cabo taco, and the tropical shrimp taco, but anything you may have is going to be great!  Also they always have a good selection of beer and wine..  Definitely a place to go with friends. Great service!< /text>

The food here is average. The service however is quite good and I got to say this is probably the best michelada you will order in la mirada hands down. It is quite pricey here tho way more so than any other mexican restaurant of this style and especially since the food isnt even really that good.</Review>

Try the Creamy Verde enchiladas. I prefer the mild version but it comes in a spicy version as well.</Review>

The food was not good!! The the rice was stale and the beans tasted like they were out of a can...The salad was soggy...my daughter ordered the fish taco and she said it was gross. $7 for a small and I mean small plate of nachos. i expected the food to be better for the price I was paying. never again. We only ate here for the convenience of being next to the theatre. The people there were very nice... but good food would have been better! I'm not here to be mean...but I ate here based on the reviews I read, about how good it was...well I don't know where these people ate, but it definitely wasn't where I was.  food did not taste fresh! I only ate my taco lft the rice Beans and salad it came with. I only paid for it because I didn't want to be rude. I'm so sorry..but maybe management will read this and make some improvements. btw I ordered the Cabo taco plate.< /Text>

<Text>This place has REALLY upped their game under the new management! They kept the new local craft beer tradition going; tonight I had a Mayberry IPA and Thai Tea Far Out IPA. Try the Mexican Creme Brulee (Catalana?). Chimichangas are still available (just ask). New menu is awesome! As is the music. We met the new owner, Brock Godwin, who gave us some background on all the changes.

Definitely taking my team here during the week. Lunch specials look awesome, $5 Mexican Ceasar Salad is incredible. Try this place, it's my new favorite hot spot!!< /Text>< Pictures>

<Review>Being generous with two stars. My husband liked his salad but the rest of our food was no bueno. The quesadilla was flavorless, the flautas were soggy, the guacamole and pico de gallo were gross. The salsa was smoky (not my thing) and the servers seemed frazzled even though there were not that many customers. #LocalGuides< /Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x80dd2b687cc93753:0x56213ba0dd8d7ea</gmapID></record>

Excellent choice of craft beer. They give you complimentary chips and salsa which is delicious. I did taco tuesday and growing up we ate unnecessary large portions. Here you get a fair portion (less than a quick taqueria)however as a chef myself who cooka authentic mexican food daily, I can tell they put attention to detail and take pride in their food.<//Text>

Great selection of beers! Good tex-mex and fusion food ("Korean pulled pork tacos topped with kimchi")! Fun opportunities for beer tasting and socializing.< /Text>

My wife and I went Thursday night and had a great meal. I had the baja tacos with a carnitas taco and a carne asada taco and both were quite good. They came with rice which was better than most Mexican restaurants and the pinto beans were good. My wife had the street tacos with steak and grilled onions and they were awesome! That is definitely what I will get next time we go.

As for the service, it was good. The restaurant wasn't crowded, but our waitress gave my wife the suggestion of the steak and onion street tacos which were excellent, checked in with us several times and made sure that my drink stayed full, so I couldn't ask for much more. All in all, a very good Mexican restaurant and one that I am glad is nearby!<//Review>

<review>(Translated by Google) Well, I liked the pozole.
It costs 8dlls and is a large bowl, accompanied by cabbage, lettuce, radishes, onions and cilantro.
By Mexican standards of decent pozole, it is approved.
The tacos in combo allow to be satisfied.
The service was very nice and the atmosphere was beautiful, a bit romantic at mid-light.

This is an awesome place. Dante is very awesome in taking pictures and videos of my husband's. Really recommend him.

Go jump is super professional and the process from getting on the ground to freefalling was so seamless. They offer so many cool packages like hand cam video and photos, definitely made my first skydive amazing. My instructor was also super friendly and helpful!</Review>

<text>Amazing experience with my group of friends jumping 15,000 feet with ocean views ending with a smooth landing.
The instructors were very vibrant and accommodating.
You can ask them anything before your jump :)
At the end of the jump they gave us a cute little surprise along with a free pen!
Loved it.
Would love to go back again!</text>< pictures>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>The jump was amazing and the instructor with me (Dante) made the experience fun and helped me conquer my fear. I was VERY disappointed to make reservations with all my friends and have our group get split into 2 different planes cause the group before us had people not show up, but after the great experience, this place definitely deserves 5 stars. The lack of any safety videos or pre-jump training was a little unexpected.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<Text>Went skydiving today for the 1st time for my bday. Booked last minute, literally an hour before my scheduled jump, and they were still able to get me in and match the Groupon price. Gave me a free bday shirt upon arrival which was so cool! I got some free stuff at the other places I went later bcuz I was still wearing the shirt! My instructor was amazing!!! Made me feel safe, secure and at ease. Such an incredible experience! Can’t wait to do it agin, it’s my new bday ritual!!!</Text><resp>{'time': 1622911175758, 'text': "Hi Noel,\nThank you for taking the time to write a five-star review.

FIRST TIME GOING ON A PLANE, AND FIRST TIME JUMPING! I have an insane fear of heights and flying and I was so nervous before my instructor was DANTE, he was very careful on how to secure me and it's the most insane feeling I've ever felt jumping off a plane! DANTE if you read this you're the MAN God bless you bro!<//Review>

< Review>
A group of 6 of us jumped together this month. We all had SUCH a great time! GoJump was very well organized and extremely professional. The people we jumped with were all very experienced veterans with thousands of jumps under their belt. We felt completely safe and were free to just focus on the thrill of the jump. Our photos and video came out fabulous and are such great mementos of our epic experience. Everybody was super nice and we can't wait to jump again. Thank you for an awesome experience, GOJUMP!</Review>

One of the best experience in my entire life!! I am so glad I decided to do this, it was accelerating and liberating! I highly recommend to those who are questioning you won’t regret it.
Every employee who works in that place were very attentive, my guide (Chris ) was very kind, patient, and funny.<//Text>

EXTREMELY disappointed!!! READ! READ! READ!
My group of 7 wanted to go celebrate a special birthday skydiving, since I’ve been here before I reccomended GoJump in Oceanside. We all agreed and very excited we all bought our Groupons which includes either photos and video for $199. As I was in charge of planning, I called to make the reservations and they tell me there will be an additional “deposit” of $60 in order to make the reservation. I said I’d have to check with my group so I called back and they gave me a different price for the deposit. I decided to have my friend call, maybe I was misunderstanding, she called and they gave her a different price for the deposit. I did read on the fine print on Groupon that it said,  “$50 refundable deposit required”, in order to reserve. I called and asked the gentleman that answered (David, guy with accent), if the $50 would be refunded when we checked in and he said no, so it’s not a deposit it’s an extra FEE, so I told him I would have to consult with the rest of the group and he offered to call me back in 15-20 min, he never called me back. I call again and another person answered and told me it would be $20 extra per person if we book for 9am instead of 3pm but since they were about to close he told me to call the following day, so I called today to reserve for 9am and now it’s $50 extra for anytime after that $80 extra instead of $50. I have no idea what’s going on, they keep changing the price to make a reservation.
WORST part of it all was this.....
When I called today David answered he gave me a higher price again and I told him he gave me a different price yesterday and told me he would call me back but never did. I asked him if I could please speak to his supervisor and he said very RUDE, “I am the supervisor”, so I went on asking to speak to his manager and again with a rude attitude said, “I am the manager”, so I asked to speak to anyone else but him and he YELLED AT ME, “no you can’t” I was in shock and disgust so I decided to hang up on him. That was extremely rude of him.
HORRIBLE customer service!
And I still don’t have a reservation.<//text>

Literally the best place to go skydiving ever. Staff inside are awesome, helpful, and fast. Instructors are the BEST and just want each person to have a great experience. The whole process takes about 1-2 hours before you're in gear and jumping but that's honestly no big as long as you're expecting it. GO. DO IT. YOU WILL NOT REGRET :D< /Text>

Honestly I was skeptical after reading some of the reviews about waiting times and appointments, but we had a great experience. We had our appointment set for a group of 4 on a Friday at 10AM. We did not wait at all, and they got us set up and ready to go super quick. All the instructors are awesome and they made sure the entire group was having a great experience. This is a great place if it is your first time skydiving! Or even if its not still an amazing staff!< /Text>

Great place to jump and beautiful views of the ocean! Had an awesome camera man who made jumping sooo much fun. Had a little problem where my camera mans go cam didn't work so they couldn't recover my video I paid for which was disappointing, but I have to say the owner did a great job in making things right with me and refunded some of my money back! I would definitely jump again here!< /Text>

My son Bryan and I made a pact 15 years ago to go jumping. We finally did it and thanks to Jessie and Kate, our experiences were fantastic. Jessie, you are a beautiful Being. Thank you for taking great care and making the flight the most enjoyable I can imagine it could have been. Kate, Bryan sends similar regards. I also have to thank all the other crew members on the ground and in the air. Be Free!< /Text>

Due to weather conditions my boyfriend & I were unable to jump. I recommend anyone looking to book, book an earlier time. We booked for 4 and unfortunately the clouds got to heavy. Although we were unable to experience skydiving, the owner and staff were extremely professional about the entire situation. The group that jumped before us looked happy, if you’re looking to skydive go here.< /review>

I went a couple days after my 21st birthday, it was my first time going. I absolutely loved it!!! I did not feel nervous whatsoever due to the fact that the staff was so nice and energetic. While flying up they kept the conversation going making me feel reassured and once we jumped I loved the experience so much, the view was so amazing. I’m definitely going again!!< /text>

This experience was truly AMAZING :) The staff, camera people, & other sky divers really made this a worthy moment in my life. "I can't wait to do this again".
A great comfortable environment. You may find it, life changing.<//text>

What an experience!! The guys at go jump are super professional but fun and light hearted at the same time. At no point was I concerned about my safety or well being. We went as a group of 5, we pre booked online and once we got there it was a smooth check in process. We booked our jump for 2pm and were harnessed and ready to jump within half hour of our jump time. You have the option of paying extra for hand cam footage OR having an extra diver jump with you filming the entire jump for you. ($98 for hand cam & $128 for the extra diver). The jump itself was phenomenal. Seeing the ocean and skyline was absolutely breathtaking!! It was about 5ish mins in total. Be prepared to have a bit of ear pain on the decent, but once your ears pop your good to go!

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone interested in going skydiving. You're in good hands at go jump!< /text>

We had such a great time skydiving with GoJump Oceanside!! I went with my mom, brother, and friend who was the only person in our group who had completed a jump before. Our original booking was for a Sunday, however we weren’t able to jump because of the marine layer, which was still thick at 3pm. We rescheduled for 2 days later at 1pm. We arrived at 12:45pm and ended up jumping at 6:00pm. This was because of the same marine layer issue and it being a semi cloudy day. The staff were very friendly and great with keeping us informed and honest with their predictions on if there were going to be jumps that day. We ate lunch and spent most of our time at the humane society next door (and even adopted and took home a cat 🤷🏼‍♀️) after we got the call we were suited up and in the air within 45 min. The plane ride to reach 13,000ft took about 10 min and everyone was out very quickly after that! My instructor, Matt, was knowledgeable, safe, and made sure I was comfortable starting on the ground before we boarded the plane all the way until we were back on the ground after the jump! My mom’s instructor, Rob, was hilarious and a pro with getting great footage not just of her but of our whole group as well. It was an overall great experience and it definitely will not be my last jump!</review>

Not sure how all the reviews are positive. Its actually mind boggling.

This was super sketchy.

Felt like I was going to die the entire time.

We had a 10 year old boy giving us our safety briefing.

Not only that but we showed up there and had to pay an additional $300 on top of the $400 we already paid through Groupon.

Even my jumper dude told us how terrible / shady the management is.

Not sure about you but I know I don't want to go to a place where the guy attached to me is telling me the management does everything they can to cut costs, and they cut corners wherever possible.

What a horrible experience this was< /Review>

I give this place 1 star because of the owner. He absolutely hustles you. The jump was fun but the guy won't give you a receipt to see why he overcharges you and keeps your deposit. They say 1 price but it is not true the term was called "premium value due to high demand" When you purchase through groupon be prepared to pay way more than if you didn't pay until last minute. I cant believe they are rated so high. It is fun though but not if you are nervous. It could be making up for lost time recently but today now actually yesterday The owner named Mike he is Swiss squeezed every last penny out of my group and wouldn't give us a receipt. I would have left on principal but I wasn't the one paying and we had purchased 199 groupon each. plus the 100 deposit that they kept and more too much to write. BUT the jump was amazing as would it be anywhere I imagine. Anywhere that you dont get hustled that is.</review>

<Review>GoJump Oceanside was fantastic.  My son and daughter jumped with me.  This was the first time for all of us.  The tandem pilots were great.   Rob especially made us feel at ease.  The whole operation was organized and professional.  I would definitely recommend.  If you're in doubt, just do it.  Oh yeah, spectacular views.< /Review>< pictures>

<text>These guys don't know anything.  I am a C license skydiver with over 350 jumps and was told since I had only made 7 jumps in the past 12 months and not 12 jumps in 12 months that I was not current.  Clearly they don't know the currency requirements in section 5 of USPA SIM that C and D license jumpers need to make at least 1 jump every 180 days to stay current.  Hate to leave bad reviews but skydiving is a community clearly these guys don't want anyone who is not in the "clique" jumping.  If you are looking to travel to DZ's outside of your home DZ stay away from this company.  Rude and does not even know the rules in which they operate under. The uspa probably needs to do an examination of the "qualified" staff working here< /text>< pics>

This was the experience of a lifetime. I was nervous going into it, but my instructor, Glenn, was super informative. He walked me through the entire process and made me feel a lot more confident/comfortable. I would HIGHLY recommend it, even if you're afraid of heights. You won't regret it.< /text>

<Review>I had a blast! I'm in California on vacation and I wanted to try tandem skydiving. Everyone was so friendly and trying to hype you up for the experience. It only took around an hour from when I arrived until I was done. Tommy was my tandem guy and he did a great job explaining the whole process to me! Overall it was a great experience!<//Review>< response>

My tandem instructor was Kale, and he was amazing! There was a slight mixup between me and someone else who had a very similar name. We had purchased different packages, so I didn't get what I paid for. We were going to ask for a refund of the difference between packages, but the lady went above and beyond and completely made my day. I would definitely jump with these guys again.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< UserId.>

< Review>
After having to reschedule due to the rain back in February, we went out on Sunday and showed up at our appointed time of 1 hour 15 mins before. Weather was a little sketchy- rain was gone but there was plenty of clouds. It ended up causing us to wait for 4 hours before flying, but let me tell you, it was absolutely worth it! Our tandem instructors treated us very well and had some nice personal touches to our videos/interviews. J.C. was great! Even the lead manager guy (forgive me I didnt get his name) tried to keep us all well informed about the weather and flight status. Will definitely come back again!<//Review>

<Review>Typically have a blast here. I am a repeat tandem diver and the staff is friendly. Have had a couple crummy jumps, but for the most part is a great place. The views are amazing. 100% reccomend. Highly suggest you call the location before booking a jump to make sure there is no maintenance issues and no bad weather predictions.</Review>< pictures>

For anyone wanting to go skydiving, this is it!  My pilot, Felix, was awesome, took great photos, and was always smiling.

This is toward the end of a long day.  I could easily see the whole crew was tired, but they kept the energy up as much as could be expected.  I give them a thumbs up!

To all the complaints....

This is the beach.  Ocean layer is a thing.  If you book for 10 am, and there are clouds until 11, you EXPECT to wait for 2 more hours.  This is safety, and common sense.  Bring a snack, sack lunch, or go get food.  This is a real thing people.

Again, kudos to Felix.  He handled everything excellently, took great photos, and made the glide and landing comfortable.</text>

I had a great experience with GoJump Oceanside last week. My friends and I went for a birthday party as a group of 7.

We used GoJump Oceanside after reading the Google reviews and decided it was perfect for us even though we drove from Los Angeles.

The reservation process online was easy and the staff was friendly and helpful  Accommodating a big group on inexperienced jumpers.

Understandingly with a larger group we had a slight wait but jumping over Oceanside was so beautiful words aren't enough. You gotta try it out for yourself.

I will definitely be back and refer my friends.
My instructor Brad was awesome, fun and knew what he was doing and how to show me all I needed to know to have an amazing experience . Thank You Brad and crew for another great memory.</Review>

<text>We had the worst experience of our lives.

Never again.

This was not our first skydiving experience.
But it was certainly our worst skydiving experience BY FAAAAAR

STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS PLACE.

I'm in the hospitality business and GoJump Oceanside is doing everything right. From the heartwarming smiles of the customer reps to the attentive caring instructors, you are set to receive a high quality experience. I couldn't ask for a better skydiving experience. A perfect view of southern California, the beaches, the pacific ocean and later in the evening, the sunset. Absolutely stunning. A must go if you are in Southern California.< /Text>

Took my husband here for his 65th birthday and he said it was one of the best experiences of his life. My mom jumped too for her 70th birthday. You have to arrive a bit too early so you sit around for a couple hours. You can watch the video of your jump immediately after landing. That’s probably the highlight for the spectators. We’ll definitely go back.< /Text>

<Review>The first time we went we couldn't jump because of bad weather. waited 6 hrs :-( the next time we went we jumped in less than an hour of arrival. Rob was funny, friendly and great. He made me feel comfortable. Only thing I would say is ask the person if they want the parachute to twirl around. I got bit of a motion sickness at that point. overall great experience. thanks to Rob and GoJump.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<Review>Beware - unprofessional staff, rude and arrogant! I skydived here around mid-Jan 2020 and my tandem skydiver, JC, was extremely rude, arrogant, condescending, and impatient. He made several cocky and snide remarks, and was very impatient at explaining basic procedures to me. When I asked him to repeat something since he was talking too fast, he replied something to the effect of "why don't you look here instead of listening". That is just one account of his misbehaviour. In short, if I were to make an analogy, he was one of those people who looks at you up-down, sizes you up, and then decides on the appropriate tone of voice and demeanor to direct at you.

I actually feel sorry for such people. In their conduct, they reveal how full of anger, fear, and insecurity they are deep down inside. Any individual who is grateful for life and humble would never behave in this manner...

Besides him, even in general, the staff is extremely unprofessional. They're basically young people (not that I have anything against young people. Also, JC mentioned above was much older, by the way) who have not been given training in customer service, how to behave and conduct themselves in front of clients, etc. I heard several of their staff regularly using the F-word and making misogynistic comments. Some of their customers had come there with the families and little children, so I'm sure they would have found such conduct objectionable as well.

After a jump, I also overheard the staff discussing technicalities of skydiving (which apparently were not performed well-enough the last time), which does not inspire confidence among customers who are right there listening to all that.

Finally, I paid extra to have my video edited and in the video they sent me, my voice is not audible and there is background music playing over it...

All in all, a very bad experience. Ruined my whole day. I had to go for dinner in the evening after the skydiving, and didn't even enjoy myself there because of the horrible skydiving experience.

If you're planning to go here, I would advise you to avoid JC as your tandem skydiver at all costs! Or better yet, I would avoid this place altogether...</Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

AMAZING EXPERIENCE....My wife and I put this on our list to do 13 years ago and I got this for her birthday. The entire staff was amazing. We did have to reschedule a couple of times  due to the weather but that's mother nature and it's safety first. The staff was amazing and super accommodating. Our skydiver Mikey Max and Ian were awesome. They guide you the entire step of the way. One of the great things i noticed was that the entire staff is like a family and brings the best energy to everyone there.. making a crazy thing like skydiving into an amazing experience. A special thanks to Mikey Max took the time to chat with us and made us comfortable and shared some cool stories. (Thanks brother) Another great shout out and thank you to Emma that was super gracious and so pleasnar ans sweet with rescheduling us and always positive. (Great team members) My wife and I got the pictures and the video and it was so worth it. The jump was amazing and unforgettable however coming home and seeing them after the jump..made it that much more special..we are totally doing it again and not waiting 13 years to do it this time..maybe a few months..😁< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< rate>

Birthday wish list granted. Entire staff was great, wonderful, and very very experienced in what they do. Rocco (my tandem jump guide) was great, funny and very professional. If you want to experience a life changing event, take a dive with Rocco.<//Text>

I jumped in Oceanside last May and my instructor Adrian was awesome.
Alas, since Mike Vetter, the owner, terminated most of his seasoned instructors who had thousands of jumps under their belt(or they quit) most of his instructors have been replaced by a few with a couple of hundred jumps under their belt. Scary, when you are jumping out of an aircraft at thirteen thousand feet.
Mr Vetter is also known for employing illegal immigrants, so are you going to trust someone who does that?  Mike's goal is money, NOT your safety.
And if you want a refund on damaged media, forget it!!
They have screwed over lots of people so with all the drop zones in southern Cali, do yourself a favor and jump where the owner follows all safety(and legal) rules! Adrian still rocks! If you want a skydiving company that lies to their customers on a daily basis, then this is the place for you! Cheers! Know this, ALL Mike Vetter cares about is your money, NOT your safety, they keep OS Police Department very busy with instructors landing "off"< /text>

<review>Great first experience skydiving. Desk staff was very friendly and helpful. Went to eat while we waited, the actual ascent and jump was spectacular. I would definitely go here again. Picture and video coverage is also very thorough so you can capture those moments before during and after.<//review></record>

<Text>Skydiving was the best experience ever!  I came with a small group.  I would have given 5 stars, but it would have been nice if the people up front would direct us where to go after checking in as well as instructions on what to do before jumping or at least during the landing (maybe an instructional video that loops while you're waiting).  You can't really hear that well when you're falling from the sky! 😂 As for my instructor,  he was sweet, except I wished he showed more of the experience in my video-- compared to what my friends had in their videos.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

My name is Lana and I jumped today with gojump oceanside. Shout out to Tommy he's an amazing instructor who made sure I was comfortable, safe, and had a great time, he constantly checked on me, made sure I was okay and was very friendly and professional,

I recommend him for your jump. My experience was unreal, beautiful and breathtaking. DK is an awesome photographer and he'll make sure your pictures and videos will be taken at every moment.

Special thanks to Benny at the desk for assisting me with the photo and video selection I appreciate your superb customer service

What I liked about paying for both the photos and videos options is that you get to select all the pictures and videos that were taken and not just a bunch,

and that's why it's worth it to pay the extra for the entire content. I came here intending to buy only videos and ended up pretty much purchasing the entire picture and video package because of how great it turned out. Additional thanks to the friendly and cooperative ladies at the front desk

I look forward to receiving the content and thanks again for a beautiful experience< /Review>

<Pics>None<//Pics><response>{'time': 1558875973334, 'text': "Hi Ashley,\nFirst off we would like to thank you for wanting to jump with us in the first place. Skydiving is an incredible sport and our goal is to share that with as many people as possible with a safe and incredible experience! Unfortunately, there are a few things that effect the safety of our favorite outdoor sport that are beyond our control- weather is one of them. Transition seasons (spring and fall) can sometimes bring a marine layer that will sit over the water and can move in and sit on top of our airspace making it unsafe to jump. Sometimes it clears up within minutes, sometimes it comes in and out, sometimes it sits there all day. Because the marine layer depends on outside versus water temperatures, they aren't on weather radars as clouds and can be very hard to predict or track. We do our absolute best to keep each of our customers informed as soon as we make decisions based on weather. Sometimes we nail it but other times the weather does something we didn't predict. Unfortunately those days you picked to jump, the weather wasn't operational. We do our best to let you guys know as soon as we know what's going on but sometimes we don't predict fast enough and I extend our apologizes for that. We know it can be frustrating to have your hopes set on jumping, make plans and organize travel to have weather stand in your way. We promise that if we could control it, it would be sunny all day long! :) On your rescheduled day we pushed your time back because the clouds were in and out all day and we landed a few airplanes without even dropping the jumpers. At a certain point, the clouds came back in and never went back out and that's when we inform all the customers. We apologize for the frustration and hope you guys are able to pick a beautiful sunny day to visit us and have the experience of a lifetime!"}< /response>< UserId.>

<text>We travel 3 hours for this experience and paid for a hotel over night to make the skydiving an event. The company canceled on us 1 hour before our jump. We rescheduled, they cancel 48 hours ahead, which was a bummer but better. We rescheduled, travel into town again, they schedule us for 3pm, push back our time throughout the day and then cancel us at 4:30 when they promised is a 5PM jump. Unprofessional and disrespectful.</text>< name>

<review>What an experience!! They're all very nice and helpful. I felt completely comfortable and safe with my jump guy. One thing that I hadn't expected was the pain in my ears during the free fall due to the change in altitude. It stopped once the chute opened and our descent slowed. I would still jump again but would see if there was a way to stop the pain.< /review>< GmapID>

Jumped on my birthday and it was an amazing experience.  The crew was friendly and really hyped you up for the jump.  They took very meticulous care and attention to safety and made sure we were ready and prepared for the jump.

You don't get the ocean view too often for a skydive and it was all worth the price of the jump alone.

All in all I'd definitely come back for another jump.<//Review>

Very good experience, my wife and I had a blast skydiving for the first time.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because when we got there to jump, everything was extremely rushed, including the safety briefing. Literally all they told us is “hold onto your straps and act like a banana when we jump.” I suppose it is as simple as that, the tandem instructor does all of the work...but there was still a lot that wasn’t explained.<//Text>

From someone who is afraid of heights and doesn't like rollercoasters, let me just tell you, it was an amazing experience! A must for sure! The views on this beautiful day were breathtaking! Seeing the snow called mountains and seconds later seeing the beautiful ocean from that vantage point was just a magical experience. I can see why people can get addicted why the instructors love skydiving. Definitely worth getting every video and picture, especially if you think you'll only do it once.

<review>So much fun. This place has a great vibe and everyone participating and  watching are so excited.  Tandem jumpers have great attitudes and help add to the excitement.  Well worth the  expense to take this adventure!</review>< Pictures>

I’ve been jumping at this drop zone for years. The family atmosphere and the people are my favorite thing about this place! Mike Vetter truly cares about all of us and I’m happy to bring my business to GoJump Oceanside and send anyone I know to this fabulous establishment. Come check it out! Whether you’re interested in your first tandem jump or fun jumping your face off this is the place in SoCal!<//review>

BEST EXPERIENCE EVER! BUt that is because I was Skydiving which is fun irrespective.

GoJump Oceanside usually cramps up 10 pairs of people for tandem jumping into a small aircraft. So, it got hard for me to breath while the plan was taking off and during the flight. I was able to catch my breath comfortably only when I was ready to jump.

This is something to look into. Other than that, they have been pretty awesome.</text>

<Review>I love this location for sky diving as you get to see the ocean and it's even fun to see the fwy as you come in for a landing.  While I didn't get to jump the second time I was here, it  was nice to see that the planes were bigger since the last time I jumped.  Great crew that knew what they were doing.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

<text>Our first dive and absolutely loved it! Yes they did delay our scheduled time because it was very cloudy and we actually appreciate that cause Even though our jump was 2 hrs later, it was a clear sky and the view was absolutely breathtaking. Loved the staff and their attitude. Can't wait to dive again!</text><Time>1500413698627< /Time>< username>

Yes, morning was overcast and schedule pushed back but knowing that,  and knowing plane capacity and time per trip, why continue to book customers throughout the day,   knowing it would leave customers left out? Our group was scheduled for 12pm but that was pushed back to 3pm. Customers were not notified until arrival and are continually told another hour... another hour... another hour.... at 7PM, still no announcement when i  had to ask if another plane was going up and was told no. And no announcement was made. First the reason was that the pilot wasn't going up again, that changed to FAA regulations. So half the group did not get to go,  although later customers in small groups were taken ahahead of us. Shame on GoJump!</text>< response>

Three words to describe GoJump: Careless, thoughtless and incompetent. Not a great combination for a sky diving business.

Similar to others' experience, their operation is poorly run with no customer service: they basically could give two flying you-know-what about the customer. I'll give it to them that they did so with a smile.

We booked a reservation, left work early, drove two hours from OC and arrived 15 minutes before our schedule appointment. When we arrived, they told us that the wait was 2.5 hours. They have our email and phone number and it didn't occur to them to let us know. The fog kept rolling in and they still encouraged patrons to "wait and see another 30 minutes", it was dusk by then and they had two more planes to go up.  I figure if this is a well established, expert shop, they would at least understand weather trends and let their appointments know that the jumps have been pushed back and begin your reschedule people. We understood weather is unpredictable and safety is the number one priority. But that does not give a business the excuse to operate in a fashion where they clearly do not care about the customer or their time. Needless to say, they called the day and we never went up. We wasted 5 hours and a half of tank of gas (plus tolls).<//text>

Was there last weekend 07/22/2017.  The jump was amazing , my instructor Joe was great and I felt very safe with him, I felt he made efforts to made me feel comfortable.
We had to great like one hour but not big deal. I hope they fix the 'managment' issues the seem to have because other than that the place and location is great<//text>

Its very rare when I do this, but this experience had to shared. It was a friend's bday and he decided to go skydiving. We went with a group of 5, it was amazing!!!!!!! INCREDIBLY AMAZING DEFINITELY RECOMMEND IT. My instructor or the guy strap to me that made sure I didn't die, his name was John, incredible person beautiful spirit had jokes so I was calm through everything. It was just a beautiful experience. Recommending Go Jump to everyone I know and also showing off my video its an experience they will not forget. Now I can tell my husband "yes babe angels do fall from the sky 😉" he did it too fyi he loved it he was terrified it haunted him for about a month but he did it I'm so proud of him ☺</Text>

Went skydiving for the first time with my wife and friends yesterday, had an awesome experience with my instructor Braden and videographer Paul. The whole jump staff made it a fun, loose, and relaxing environment. The actual jump is exhilarating yet peaceful. Highly recommended, will do this again.</text>

Do not skydive here!!! They will waste your time.

I flew in from Denver to skydive at Gojump.
We checked in at around noon and were told to come back at  1:45 ( even though we had an aapt). After coming back we waited for 2.5 hours only to be told at 5pm that due to the weather they would not be flying anymore- Although they close at 5 so I question if it was really the weather or just the fact that they were done for the day.
Since I flew in from Denver for this, I asked if they could give me a special deal or some type of offer for the time wasted (5 hours) and they said there was nothing they could do for me. I asked to speak to the owner (Mike) and was told that he was not there but it was a lie he was behind the counter.
I understand weather changes happen but I did not appreciate the fact that they did not appreciate me as a customer or the time I wasted.
DO NOT SKYDIVE here!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The they will waste your time!!!!!!!!!!!!!< /Review>

Before going, I read a few of the comments. Doing that before our trip gave me a sense of what to expect. We were delayed because of weather, but because I read about the possibility, I wasn't that concerned. The staff was great especially our instructors, Kevin and Ian! Great experience!!!<//text>

<review>The EPIC thing I never ever did before! Thanks to my instructor Ian, very nice and patient , help me to finish this challenge. Since it was sunny, we didn't encounter any delay. It took 1 hour and 15 minutes from preparation to landing. I will definitely recommend my friends to come here and at that time I will come back again!  Peace< /review>< pictures>

<review>Skydiving crew is amazing, but I would never pay a penny to this establishment. It's all about the almighty dollar, which is not what you want when your life is in someone's hands. I at least expected professionalism. We sat for 4 1/2 hours, being strung along, with staff telling us to check back every 30 minutes, and yet we never got to jump. The owner was at the desk, and didn't even apologize. He was arrogant and rude. Go somewhere else to jump.</review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

< review>
All the staff were stellar, from booking, to flying, and after service. Did the right thing to book my first jump with this company. Arrived there at 10:40, got in plane at exactly 11:00, flight for 15-20mins then jump. Best adventure ever, not even a pinch of pain, no relapse or whatnot, just hangover with euphoria haha. Everything was phenomenal! Maxim was a rockstar on air, he made it blissful and extremely fun, his directions were all clear. Luke was very warm, he made me feel like we’ve known each other for a very long time and I love it. He gave the best outside shots I could ever hope for. Check out my IG video: annedexionary

Will definitely jump again with them both and will even be prepared for 50% tip next time. Those awesome men deserve it.<//review>

<Review>Amazing experience,  just be prepared to wait a long time for your turn. We had a 3pm reservation,  but had to wait 2 hours before we actually jumped. That wait was with NO weather,  or mechanical delays. Kind of a let down considering I had to cancel plans later in the day to accommodate the wait. Overall, the jump was worth the wait.  My jump instructor was very nice and I felt safe jumping with him. Make sure to get pictures and video because it goes by so fast,  you'll want something to look back at and remember.</Review>< Pics>

Worst customer service experience of my life. l took the skyjump with video package. The jump experience was great but my freefall video portion wasn't captured because of malfunctioning. I demanded a refund for video option and got no response from their support team even after repeated follow ups.<//review>

Service is hit and miss, some are extremely friendly and do there best to make sure you have the ultimate experience, others don't care whether you live or die and treat you like you don't exist... Unless you are getting a very good rate, I'd look elsewhere.  If it hadn't been for the two people that really did put effort into their job (the two guys that I actually jumped with) I'd give this place a lower rating.  Thanks to them my experience was salvaged, I almost cancelled the jump.  You'd think a place that holds your life in their hands would take better care of their customers.  The name of the game here is get your money, not love of the game.< /review>

This was flippin amazing! ASK TO JUMP WITH TOMMY!!! All of the GoJump employees are down to earth, knowledgeable, & energetic (with the exception of the front desk ladies who seemed hella stoned and mis informed us on basic information) but Tommy (my guide) was a step above the rest, simply put, hes amazing. He was respectful and kind, always made sure to check in and make sure I was feeling right, as I'd imagine adventures such as these can be overwhelming to some. On the way up he took the time to scream over the plane engine and point out different sights around San Diego such as the La Jolla coves, Catalina island, Coronado, etc. He verbally walked me through each step along the way so I was prepared and not caught off guard, which in turn made me feel safe. My friend did not get the same experience with her guide which makes me all the more confident when I tell you to ASK TO JUMP WITH TOMMY. Sky diving at GoJump is absolutely worth the time & money. It's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen and having a guide such as Tommy made the experience unforgettable from beginning to end. I gave 5 stars despite the misinformed stoney twins at the front desk cause the prep, the ride, the jump and the guide (TOMMY) made up for the 5 mins of confusion. Keep doing what you're doing guys 🤙Aloha<//Review>

Jumped on a beautiful sunny day at Gojump in Oceanside today. We had to wait about an hour and 45 to have the sky clear up but overall the experience was great. The instructors were friendly, helpful, and engaging. Jesse is a great instructor and I felt like my life was in good hands, lol. Definitely a memorable experience and would recommend anyone to GoJump.< /text>

<Review>Bad business! We had reservations to jump at 5 p.m. today. You called and canceled due to weather. We were already on our way to Oceanside when you called. It turned out to be a beautiful day, sun is shining and the sky is almost clear. Come to find out, you guys are still operating taking the earlier reservations in our place. That doesn't seem right. The earlier reservations should be rescheduled and we should be able to keep our reservations. We have two people that had to build up the nerves to do this and two people who traveled from Colorado to have the ocean view experience. Very disappointing!</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

<text>In their confirmation email, they should alert you to take antihistamines so your ears don’t burst especially in the flu/cold season   My ears  killed me the whole way down. Also freezing temperature. You should be allowed to cover ears somehow. My one lobe was swollen for hours. Also my tandem mate never warned me about difficulty breathing; other instructors told their flyers to scream first 10-15 seconds to get used to thin oxygen and breathing. I struggled first 15 seconds without any verbal aide. I think my guy is just over taking people up.< /text>< name>

I pre paid for my partner and I to go skydiving, we repeatedly had to cancel due to delays related to weather. My partner & I decided that we would like to be refunded, & we're assured that we would be.  Since then, I was refunded my initial deposit. After that, I reached back out to the business to request my full refund (I am still owed $298).

The owner mike (who has been extremely unresponsive) initially said that he tried to refund my card but was unable to get the refund to process successfully.  After waiting for quite some time, I told mike that I would be filing a complaint if I was not refunded. He then assured me that he would be sending a check out. I waited again, didn't receive anything, reached back out to mike & have not heard back. I also emailed the business to request the business license number 3 weeks ago and have not heard back.

I've been trying to handle this matter since September 24 2017 (almost 1 year). My experience with mike & go jump oceanside has  been extremely negative. I am very concerned about their business practices & feel that they have handled this process very irresponsibly.<//review>

All safety measures and precautions are taken, so there is no complaint about that from me. I appreciate that they don't take risks with safety. However, as many of the other reviews have mentioned, GoJump does not value the customer's time. They canceled our first appointment without notifying us, and we only found out after making the long drive down to the area. We rescheduled twice after that, and they were extremely inflexible about times. We had booked our first reservation about a month in advance, so they should have been more accommodating with their times.

The third reservation we booked was at 5 pm.  Remember, the time is booked with the assumption that you're actually going to be getting on the plane pretty soon after that time. We called at 3 to confirm that they were still on, and all seemed well. We arrived at 4:45 pm to be told that there was a 2 hour delay. We waited for an hour and 20 minutes, and then they canceled the rest of the jumps due to weather. There was no compensation for our wait, drive, or the inconvenience of constantly rescheduling.

Again, I'm glad that they don't try to force jumps in bad weather conditions, but this inefficient scheduling is ridiculous. I can't imagine trying to do this on a vacation with limited time. If you're really set on using this company, I'd suggest to book your reservation in the middle of the day and then plan to make it a full-day commitment.

When we finally did get to jump, it was truly an amazing experience. The tandem pilots are great and seem really focused on making sure you're comfortable.

In all, I think the office should be more organized and helpful. I think the best way to ensure your jump the first time is to schedule it for late morning or early afternoon. Thank you.</review>

I requested my money refunded and instead of giving me the run around. They not only contacted the third party but wrote and signed a document stating that I be refunded, due to no fault of my own. I recieved an email that same day from the third party stating that my money was being refunded. These are good people</text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

I thought it was crazy. The plane turned around to chop us up while we flew through the air, and the skydiving guide pulled out a gun shooting the plane down. Crazy Cool!!!!

I highly recommend jumping to everyone.< /Review>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>If it is your first time going skydiving and you would like to tandem skydive, I would recommend buying your ticket on Groupon. It is much cheaper. They are very nice people. It is usually somewhat crowded but the wait to go up is 30 minutes or less. The planes are always taking off to drop a new load of sky divers. They fully answer any questions you have and have great package deals for those who love skydiving. The area is calm. However, parking isn't that great. They also sell food outside while you wait. If you just want to watch, they have an area outside to watch.
Now when you go on the plane, they take you over the ocean. The instructors have GoPros to record every moment.
Appointments are required to secure your spot. They will cancel and reschedule due to weather. Make sure you check the weather if you don't wish to get an email or a call about them having to reschedule due to the weather.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

UPDATE: Mike the owner contacted me personally to apologize and was nice enough to give me the option of my money back or to redo the experience....of course I prefer redoing it!
Can’t wait to go back! Thanx again for the generous offer, I will see you soon!

First time skydiving long story short...waited over 2 hours after being told 30 minutes...worst part 3 days after I finally called to see what happened with my pictures and video...to come to find out they lost it....?
You can't take back a first time experience like this....want to see if they makeup for it.

1 star goes to Becca for being an amazing instructor with a great personality! Thanx Becca<//Text>

< Review>
BE AWARE: Even if you make an appointment online and come 15 minutes your scheduled appointment, YOUR STILL GOING TO HAVE TO WAIT 1 to 2 HOURS BEFORE GOING. When you come in you sign a waiver and ypu head to the desk to check ID and pay, not once did they ever ask you what time is your appointment. You could have been just driving by and you wanted to go sky diving so you come here, meanwhile there is someone who booked their jump at the same time, if they get there before you then too bad they go first. This is something that has to get fixed right away. When you schedule a reservation for a jump at a time you should be jumping at that time not 2-3 hours afterwards.< /Review>

I just went yesterday.Was my first Tandem Jump! I am scared of heights and extreme rollercoasts but since my dad passing due to cancer it made me realize life is too short! This was part of my bucket list I am thankful to Go Jump and a special thanks to My instructor Paul for making it fun and an epic experience for me! You must at least do it once! YOLO!❤</Review>

<Review>The wait is way too long. Employees lie and say the wait is one hour. We waited 3 hours before going to the desk and asking what was going on. We were told we’d go up in 15 minutes. She lied. We waited another hour and a half.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<Text>Terrible customer service....
My appointment was supposed to be at 2pm
I arrive at the town at 1pm then they call me and tell me it's been pushed to 5pm. Then I wait till 5 and I get there. Then they tell me they are not flying at all today because their ONLY plane is broken....

I drove 6 hours to get here and wasted another 3 hours in the empty town thanks to this place.

They did not provide any compensation other than a "sorry"</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Not recommended. If you want spend a lot of your time for nothing go to GoJump.
Beside that Groupon NON REFUNDABLE but representative told me it is.
Unsatisfying and bad experience.<//text>< pictures>

<text>It's a once in a lifetime experience. The skydive itself was incredible. But I'm only giving GoJump three stars because we have waited for almost half a day despite booking beforehand. We've booked a dive at 12 noon but we did not jump until 5 pm. We arrived at the place 15 to 12 and we were told that there's a lot of people jumping that day so we should go back at 2 pm. So we had some snacks first and went to the beach and came back but was told to wait another 45 minutes... and another 40 minutes... then finally we were called but we waited for the helicopter for some more minutes. But dive was so worth it that I forgot all the complaining I did for three hours.<//text>< Resp>

Why is there even an option to make an appointment?

We made our appointment for 2PM, showed up 20 minutes prior to be told it would be about an hour wait. At 3PM, we inquired about an update and was told it would be another 25 minutes or so. Finally, at 4PM, the staff said that it did not look like we would even be able to go up in the air. We were offered a refund but this was after driving an hour to get there, two hours twiddling our thumbs in a tent outside, and now another hour drive back to our hotel. A refund is not going to give me back a full day wasted on my vacation. Very disappointed.< /Text>

Such nice people. We went on June 23 @ 10:00. Unfortunately we had June gloom. It wasn't expected to burn off until 2ish. We could have waited but decided to reschedule for another time. There has to be clear skies over the jump zone. I went with a Groupon and was concerned that it would be a problem. It's not. We will reschedule for sometime in July so my nephew can go for his 18th birthday. We did not have to pick a date right then. .....BTW. we're glad we did not wait. It ended up not burning off till late afternoon.< /review>

< review>
Felt a little skeptical about this place because of the mixed reviews. But besides that the place was really good. Front desk didnt give me any issues about my Groupon, they even let me jump 30 minutes before my actual scheduled time. The dive itself was amazing and totally worth the drive and money for that view. Instructors were very nice and enthusiastic. Would defiantly go again. I went on a Friday and only had one plane ahead of me so I was done within an hour.</review>

<text>Worst customer service... I'm still shocked. Specifically speaking, the manager, think his name is Mike, is the worst.

We drove 3 hours from LA and waited for 3 hours. At 6 pm, we were told that we couldn't jump due to the weather. Which is fine, but when we asked the manager (very nicely) is it possible to give us an incentive to come back (a video or something), he was so condiscending and keep saying "I don't understand why would I do that".
He made it a very easy decision to get a refund.

If you go, hope you get to jump (booking earlier in the day if possible), because dealing with the manager would not be pleasant.< /text><Response>None< /Response><Rate>1</Rate></record></dataset><record>

<text>It sad that companies like this are not avaliable to give their services.
In first place they send me to breakfast for the cloudy day, it's OK, I understand that but after that they told me that my family and I have to wait cause the don't have a good plane, ok again, I wait 3 hours just to they told me that it doesn't work so they can't do anything.
They not offer a discount, anything.
Hope that they can fix this.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<text>Disgusting experience with go jump. Wasted a whole day of my vacation... Drive so many hours to get there for them to tell us the jump is cancelled after delaying it without even calling us and notifying. The staff is lacking experience. The owner has zero business experience and seems to have the mindset that the customer can be wrong.</text><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x80dc702e7962ca9d:0xceed590d529b63a8</GmapID>< pics>

<Review>The actual jump was amazing but the people behind the desk were extremely rude. I booked my jump through Groupon and thought i was purchasing the jump for $50,but the wording was deceiving. I also bought the video & pic package but felt I was missing some shots. I called and the girls who picked up were extremely rude and kept passing the phone to a different person because they didn't want to deal with me. The first time I called the girl said they were too busy to explain my concern over the phone and would have someone call me back and explain it. She didn't ask me for my number or name. I called a second time and the girl who picked up passed the phone to a different girl because she didn't want to deal with my concern. Don't get me wrong, i had an amazing experience, but they need to replace the people who handle their phone calls.< /Review><user_id>114480747964011095940< /user_id>< resp>

We work extremely hard all year for our annual vacation and this place ruined a big part of it. The blonde chick at the desk was being extremely rude. They did not send out an email or call for cancelling our jump and tells us to talk to the manager I think his name was MIke? Or Michael. Mike is probably the worse business owner I've ever encountered. Yelled at my wife and I for complaining about driving 8 hours down to Southern California without getting a call for the jump being cancelled. Mike tells me he only has one plane and The propeller fell off today ???!! Please take my word and book with a bigger company that has more reliable/safer planes and more importantly  a decent customer service</review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

< Review>
Oh my Tandem pilot was amazing!!!! He was very freindly, supernice. He was very helpful to get me on this as this was my first jump, he made it so comfy.
Great place to jump as the view was worth million.
They take jumps very seriously for the safety of people. Our jump was delayed for almost and hour due to dark clouds... but once they passed oh we geared up for one the most adventurous thing.
My ODV Anmark was brilliant as well, she took great shots and videos of me with a great view.
Later one the video I saw doing crazy stuffs on cam which made my video so cool.
Will be a great memory.
My jump was excellent...... I m definitely coming back again... and recommend others as well.
Go jumpfly the sky n taste how it tastes and you will always look up.!!!!< /Review>

<date>1476742415394<//date><Rate>2< /Rate><Text>Some friends and I made a reservation for a sunset jump (4pm), and drove out from las vegas to do it.  We left Vegas at 7 am, ready to go and with plenty of time to arrive, book our hotel, and head to skydive.  We got a text at 1 pm that day saying that our dive was canceled due to unforeseen circumstances.  We called, and were told that weather had pushed the timetable back, and if we wanted to come down they would try to fit us in, but no guarantees.

We decided to try our luck, and drove down...

We arrived at the office, and asked to speak to someone about whether we would be able to fly or not, they directed us to the manager who told us that at 8 am it had gotten very cloudy, and no one was able to jump for 3 hours.  As such the timetable had been pushed back, and sadly there was no time for us to jump today.  I explained we had driven all the way out from Las Vegas to jump with them, and he told us he understood that but there was nothing he could do, he offered to reschedule us for another day, but as they were full both Saturday and Sunday he was unwilling to schedule us for then.

The reasons for the low review score are these.

1.  The company did not call/text us when inclement weather occured to let us know we might be delayed.  Nor did they let us know after it was clear we WOULD be canceled (at 11 am)  They waited until 1pm to let us know.  I completely understand if things get canceled because of weather and am in no way holding them responsible for the weather.

2.  The company was unwilling to work with us in any way shape or form after bumping us from our times.  A reservation is a reservation, if someone has one for a specific time it holds no less value than someone from an earlier time.  If they are going to bump people who are later in favor of those who are earlier then it makes no sense whatsoever to EVER book later with these people.

3.  The company was perfectly willing to cancel later reservations, yet was unwilling to push anyone from other days in order to make things right with those who were canceled in prior days.

4.  While the manager displayed a calm demeanor, the receptionists don't.  They are rude, and unpleasant.

5.  If you say "I would like to make this right for you"  then do nothing whatsoever to "make this right for you"  then it is a lie.  Don't lie to potential customers.

We booked with Lake Elsinore skydiving the next day and had an awesome time.  its a little bit more spendy, but the customer service was good, and it actually felt like they cared.</Text>< pictures>

Made a reservatuon and still had to wait 2 HOURS TO GO.... This is unfair and the management is terrible for allowing this. Very unfair to those who have planned out there entire day to be told that they still have to wait a LONG time even though they had a reservation. Reading all these reviews alot of people have this same problem... time for management to make some adjustments. UNBELIEVABLE.<//Review>

GoJumpOceanside. The only complaint I have was that we had an appointment on Sunday at 12pm and we didn't jump till right before 5pm. When we arrived and checked in they said they hadn't jumped anyone all morning due to weather(sky's weren't clear enough over head) and said we had a 2hr wait , they started to send planes up but they had all the morning appointment to get through and catch up on, so we left and went to go eat, came back at 2pm and still had more of wait and they were stoping again because clouds were coming back.But to be honest after being there you could say that they should call you and let you know what's happening if delayed and your appointment is in the PM but in reality they only had 2office staff their that day and that's a lot of people to call and no one can detect the what the weather is going to do. And to be honest I'd rather wait all day or reschedule if their major concern is the safety of everyone going into the sky , so for me I'd rather be delayed hours if it means it's the best safety precautions they can do by delaying and making sure the weather is in good condition to sky dive . But anyways it Was a great experience! , the skydive was nothing like I thought it would be! IT WAS AWESOME! -and my sky dive Professional Thomas made it awesome! The only complaint is the delayed hours but after going through it , it was completely understandable weather safety is serious and I'd rather have that then a business that doesn't care about that, and Go Jump Oceanside is by the beach so you have to realize that , that kind of weather is a common thing their so delays are highly possible. And since we were delayed about 4.5 hrs when we jumped it was sunset time so that was even better . So my advice is if your going their plan an appointment around from morning time to 1pm and for sure you probably will jump that day even with delays ,. And plan it to be an all day thing or half day event , don't just plan on coming in at your time and being out in an hour but other than that it was a AWESOME EXPERIENCE and I would do it again< /Review>

<rating>1< /rating><text>Be careful if purchasing jumps on Groupon. I bought a groupon for one jump at GoJump Oceanside so that I could join my friends on the date they had already reserved. However when I tried to redeem the groupon GoJump told me my groupon was not valid for the day my friends were jumping, that it was only worth $50 towards a jump on that date (I paid $179 on Groupon), and that I'd have to wait a month to redeem my groupon without paying extra. Groupon was a complete pain to get a refund from as well.< /text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

(Translated by Google) Excellent service, I had the opportunity to contact Mathew who guided me throughout the process, the purchase was highly recommended, now I just need to grab the courage for my wife and sister-in-law to jump, see you soon! God first.

<rating>1</rating><text>(Translated by Google) Very bad communication. I had several doubts regarding a jump to give away, and only once did they answer the call and an email, then I could not communicate again, since they do not answer the phones or they did not respond to the EMAIL.

Therefore I could not or rather, decided not to buy due to mistrust.

Very bad communication. I had several doubts regarding a jump to give away, and only once did they answer the call and an email, then I could not communicate again, since they do not answer the phones or they did not respond to the EMAIL.

Muy mala comunicacion. Tenia varias dudas respecto a un salto para regalar, y solo una vez me constestaron la llamada y un email, luego no pude volver a comunicarme, ya que no atienden los telefonos ni me respondieron el EMAIL.
La pagima web no es clara, la unica vez que me atendieron la informacion era diferente (costo y sobre el video del salto) con lo que figura en la web..
Por ende no pude o mejor dicho, decidi no comprar por desconfianza.

(Translated by Google) It's cold going up. Wear it warmly ... and it's a bit dizzy when you're spinning. Tell the Instructor not to spin, not a photo, but I did an outside video and this is better. It's a waste of money for wrist videos and other photos.

(Original)
올라 가면 추워요. 따뜻하게 입으시길...그리고 빙빙 도는데 좀 어지럽습니다. 인스트렉터 한테 스핀 하지 마라고 하세요.사진 말고 전 아웃 사이드 비디오 햇는데 이게 젤 나아요. 손목 비디오나 다른 사진은 돈 아까워유..비싸도 아웃 사이드 비디오 추천<//review>
