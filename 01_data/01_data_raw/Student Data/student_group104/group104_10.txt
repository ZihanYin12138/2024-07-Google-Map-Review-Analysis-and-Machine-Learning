< Review>
Classy K-9 Clips is the best!!! Just took my puppy cavoodle here and Tammy did a wonderful job. Bixby looks wonderful and the staff were very professional. They called me as soon as he was finished and I did not have to wait long in the parking lot for assistance. Highly recommend!< /Review>

< Review>
I have Brussels Griffons, 5 to be exact. If they are unable to groom them complete why charge us as if you did. I understand 2 are puppies. (4 months and 15 months) and you could not do their faces. You did not finish the job and don’t charge me, the customer the full charge. With me leaving a tip as if you did before I saw you did not finish the job. Love the vet but now I will find another groomer to take care of my 5 Brussels.</Review>

They made my Bear (my dog) look so handsome with his grooming.  They always do such a great job but most of all they are always nice & cheerful.  They never complain about Bear even though I know he can be a bit difficult.  They always provide great service with a smile.</Review>

<Text>I arrived at our appointment time with a nervous first time grooming appointment. I was acknowledged through a glass door by a groomer. I saw three female groomers through the glass divider, working. No one came out to greet us. No one was present at the front desk. After 15 minutes we departed. No one called to inquire why we left. I just didn’t feel that the business cared enough about me and more importantly my medicated treasured pet. There wasn’t a groomer available for my 10am appointment. It was all very odd.< /Text><userid>106254737998477160206<//userid>< Resp>

<Text>Great price for the friendly, professional, and good job they do. My dog doesn't mind coming here at all and that's saying a lot. I just wish they filed his nails when they finish clipping them cuz they look choppy. Otherwise definitely the best groomers we have gone too. Sad to leave this area and have to find another good groomer.< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

We have used Classy K-9 Clips since we first moved to Oceanside several years ago.  They have always been the best.  We have two dogs done here for less than one in Orange County.  Here they are "groomed", not just bathed.  We had a show dog groomed here and the breeder commented that the grooming was better than she had ever seen elsewhere.  It may take more time than another place but the quality of the service combined with the prices is tremendous.  I will highly recommend them to everybody.</Text>

<review>Waited 2 weeks for an appointment and they were unable to cut and groom my dog. They said my dog nipped at them. The same dog that had no issues with any other groomer, and the same one who will lick you clean if you if you put your face anywhere near him lol. Absolutely ridiculous that professonal groomers could not handle a super sweet and friendly dog. If he nipped, they must have really hurt him, he doesnt like even walking by the place anymore. To reiterate even when at his worst, growling at another threatening dog, you can make a kissy sound and he will give you a few licks to make sure you are comforted. I dont know how they hurt my dog, but I will never go back.<//review>< pictures>

<Review>Love K9 Clips!! I used to take my dogs to Pet Smart and I'd leave them there for 4 hours and then they'd be ready for pick up, but at K9 clips my two pups were done in a hour and a half! They got the full works, bath, nail trim, hair cut, blow dry, and teeth brushing. Plus I love the staff.  And I LOVE that their linked with my vet (surfside animal hospital) that I never need to worry about taking in proof of rabies, because they have it on file) I recommend this place to everyone! And the price for both my dogs are UNBEATABLE!</Review>< Gmap_id>

On top of the skilled groomers, the prices are great. Every other groomer is a ripoff compared to them.</review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x80dc703382865b81:0x8db6396c17f847b6<//Gmap_id></record>

<text>Although our dog is very friendly and easy going most of the time, when it comes to being groomed, he becomes kind of crazy. A previous groomer asked that we no longer bring our dog to them. We switched to Classy K-9 Clips and they not only take good care of him, but he also comes out looking a lot better than the previous groomer. And their pricing is even better than the previous groomer.< /text>< pictures>

<review>I took our 12 yr old dog there to be groomed. I had never been there before and told them about the dog's issues, being confused, hard of hearing and glocoma.
They did a wonderful job and Max was a very happy dog.</review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

I have had several groomers for all my dogs over the years but this place is one in a million. A month ago my wife brought one of our Australian Shepherds in to get her shaved. She said the lady made her feel guilty about shaving an Aussie so she just had her groomed. The lady told her it was bad for their skin. The problem is, after winter she sheds an insane amount of hair. But...we tried what the groomer instructed and brushed her daily. She still shed so much, we only let her in at night. Our dogs live with us so this does not work. A month later I brought the same dog back to get shaved. My wife was so intimidated by this lady she did not want to take her. So I did. I thought my wife was exaggerating with the guilt experience. NEVER, NEVER, NEVER, in a thousand years did I ever think I'd be writing a review about a crazy groomer who is off her rocker, but her it is. She was overbearing,  rude, impossible to communicate with, and an absolute nightmare. The poor desk lady just sat there and listened in disbelief. After the groomer walked out, the desk lady apologized over and over again. My point is this! I would not recommend this place for ANY reason. If the groomer reads this, I know what she'd say. I (crazily) am just trying to protect the dogs. A. We tried your method, it did not work. B. BEING OUTSIDE ALL THE TIME, can't be better for the dog and not better for our family. C. We have owned NUMEROUS Aussies and have never had skin issues no matter what their age was. D. IT'S NOT YOUR DOG!!! Trying another groomer today. My wife was never more right about "The Crazy Groomer".</Text>

< Review>
I have tried a lot of groomers and never have been as pleased with any groomers as I have with Classy K9.  They are gentle, kind and very talented.  My Cavalier gets a Lion cut that is just adorable.  People comment all the time.
Prices are fair as well.< /Review>

This was my first time at classy K-9 and I was very excited based on reviews and prices for dog cuts.  When I got there 10 minutes prior to my dogs appointment, the lady in front was overwhelmed because there were so many appointments and she couldn't seem to get everyone signed in etc. when the groomer came to take my dog she asked me what I would like and specifically told her how I wanted my dog cut. She wrote it down on some scrap paper which I found very unprofessional. My dog went in for a bath, hair cut, nails cut, trimming , ear cleaning and teeth brushing. What is suppose to take 3-4hrs took them 2hrs to do. My husband went to pick up our dog and when he got home I noticed his cut was all choppy . He was cut down so low under his chin that there was no hair follicles there. He had a big visible red patch there. His ears were shaved , the hair in his ears are still there and he wasn't blow dried. I was extremely upset and called them right away. The groomer came on the line and had the nerve to tell me he came in with that red patch. I went back in the next day and showed the supervisor a picture of my dog the day before and she understood where I wS coming from, she then had him seen by the vet and he clearly said I need to have a conversation with the groomer that this this to him because it looks like they put the razor too close.
Afterwards Heather the supervisor there told me she can not do anything right now but the other supervisor will call me Tuesday . I call Tuesday morning and she isn't in today, she'll be in tomorrow . I feel like they are not taking me seriously and I will not stop until my dog service is refunded to me.
This place and staff have no respect for people or dogs. My dog will NEVER be groomed there again.< /text>

Not only that he had razor burn on his genitalia. I called to discuss what happened. They told me that we can schedule an appointment with the vet to see his issue. I took the appointment, but never showed for it. I was afraid of their handling of my dog as they obviously hurt him before. The only saving grace is for them to contact me, and refund me my services. I would urge you to never go here.<//review></record>

Eh, my appointment was at 1 and their bad service ignored us and finally served us at 1:30. They saw us and let people cut in front of us. Good job on grooming, but it took 5 and a half hours to do 2 dogs.</text>

<review>We had chicken tikka, chicken kabob, chicken shawarma, and beef kabob, and everything was delicious. We also had a soup that was superb (but no idea what it was called). Our server was very friendly and accommodating. We did not feel rushed at all. And prices were extremely reasonable.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<review>Sagmani's is hard to find but worth the search. The service is prompt and helpful (and this is good because you may have no idea what some of the menu items are), the owner is very friendly, and the food is dreamy. They advertise the best kabobs in town, and they're not kidding. Also the best falafel, with this turmeric sauce that is so yummy I could drink it.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

I've tried multiple  mediterranean restaurants and by far this has been my favorite! Food was fresh and delicious! The service was AMAZING! Our waitress would always check up on us, made sure we were always satisfied. I would highly recommend this place:)< /Review>

I loved the Service, Very welcoming, I had a Pea Soup, Taboulli, Humus, Tea, and Hibiscus water. I was blown away at the rich taste of every single item I had the great pleasure of tasting. That is from the food to beverages. If you are looking to have amazing Arabic food this is definitely the place.

They are hustlers. I paid for beef shawrma and then I got chicken shawrma( which is a less price than beef) and the refused to correct their mistake and they spoke badly with us. They are unpolit. I will never ever purchase food from them again.< /review>

Today is my first time at this place , I just bought my takeaway lunch ( chicken Mandi)  from this restaurant , i’m totally Disappointed ;

the price is very high comparing to the quantity ( very low food quantity) ,,, also the chicken is not professionally cleaned . Need to re-consider the price/ quantity factor .</text>

<rate>5</rate><Review>Sales/ front end and security:

- extremely nice, knowledge (loved my sales woman--patient, calm, and compatible personally to match the client's needs.)

Decor:

- very comfortable, floor plan nice, feels very medical

Product:

-  Nice strains, small reputable farm quality, naturally grown without any or very little pesticides. Offers editable, oils, flower, vapes, pre rolls, lotions, pet care, and proper paraphernalia.

Location:

- hidden from street view. In the back of small shopping complex.  Parking available.

Price:

- Decent. The quality is great, so the price range is excellent. Justifiable tax applied.

Cash only as of now.

Deals:

- very excellent deals.

Overall:

Was referred. Will come back. I was very satisfied with my first first.

Every time I come here, I get nothing but love.
Best tenders in the valley work at this spot, no doubt!
And the news they have to offer here are of course too of the line stuff!
If you're not coming to this spot for your medical needs, you're definitely  missing out !
They got daily deals and always giving out free meds onto of the deals!
Hit this place up,  YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT.< /review>

I really love this place, my number one favorite dispensary in Los Angeles County. I always have the greatest experience when I come into the Herbal Pain Relief Center. Excellent customer service is an understatement, this shop is completely awesome!< /Text>

<review>Great product. My only complaint is , the staff needs to pay attention to the stamp card. If this establishment offers stamps for 2 for Tuesday , the staff should honor that policy. They just stamp once not twice and it is useless to bring it to their attention.</review>< GmapID>

<response>None< /response><Review>They get a two because of the product or else they would have gotten a straight one as I believe customer service is extremely important. This place was my number one until they decided that taking profits are more important than keeping your customers happy. My VAPE cartridge started leaking on day #6. Instead of doing the right thing and giving me a new one for my troubles they start quoting nonsense to hide behind about manufacturers warranty. I've been in two different shops before this one where they replaced my leaking cartridge passed the "3 day manufacturer warranty" NO QUESTIONS ASKED so don't give me no BS about manufacturer warranty. Anyways, their loss because I know I wont be going back there and I hope, after reading this, you won't either.<//Review>< name>

<review>All I have to say, is the this place turned out to be pretty expensive, I know it’s under different management for what I hear, but nothing how it used to be, from and 1/8 the used to go for $35 plus your points maybe $30 out the door.
Now $47 out the door this is crazy, that’s for sure I’m taking my business someplace else that is ridiculous.< /review>< userid>

<Review>Went in after reading reviews on Weepmaps and checking out the menu...looked like a great shop. I get there and the parking is terrible, circled twice and then parked at Del Taco. When I get in the shop it seemed nice and there were about 4 people behind the window. I hand over my rec. and I.d. and the security guard runs my number and then hands back my things and tells me that they aren't accepting new patients. When I asked why I got no answer. Nowhere online did I read anything that said "no new patients." HUGE waste of time.<//Review>< Pics>

Extremely friendly staff as well as very informative. Gave me a very well versed run down on all their styles of chicken and sauces. Their traditional sauce is absolutely amazing. It has the classic buffalo taste and a very light heat that doesn't leave your mouth torched. There are definitely a larger variety of options then I was expecting. They also have burgers and salad's.</Review>

First time here,  food came out quick and the servings were much bigger than anticipated. Gentleman who took our order was very helpful with the menu and pointing out all of our options. Lota of TVs so there is no chance of missing the action. Will definitely be back to enjoy a cold one next time.< /review>

Only tried the tenders (BIG). Nice crispy outside, and moist, perfectly cooked chicken inside. Plenty of sauces to choose from; mango madness has a great kick! Staff were very pleasant. Will visit again in the future.<//review>

From the outside the advertising is great. The interior was clean and orderly. The menu looks great. Then comes time for execution. I ordered a chicken sandwich with ranch and  tots. The chicken was thin and the edges were like leather. Tots were enough for 3-4 people. Not sure if the owner cares about profitability or not. Last thing, the mango madness sauce tastes like Tabasco mixed with bbq and a touch of vinegar, tastes nothing like mango, disgusting. The beer selection on tap is the same as any other place that serves beer on tap, nothing special. There is a lot of chicken sandwich competition, wicked falls way short of being a competitor. Fix the kitchen and your business will grow, or replace management with people that know what they are doing.

*** added comment. $8.57 for modelo draft!! Seriously over priced.

Update: thanks for the math lesson. 3-2=1<//Text>

<review>Staff was extremely friendly and the food was tasty but overpriced. The woman working was so personable and accommodating. The bone in wings were perfect. Crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. The tenders were a little dry though. The sides (garlic fries and poppers) were pretty average - good but not worth the extra money. 10 piece wings were plenty filling and flavorful without needing the extra sides.</review>< Pictures>

<Review>We came here for lunch using a Living Social coupon at $15 for $30. I use coupons because I work too hard for my money and appreciate a savings.  This place was a pizza place before and looks like it was completely redone and too the better.

We place our order at the counter and one item the people there could not figure out the discount.  I ordered a chicken sandwich, which came with fries and a drink, my wife ordered the wrap, same thing (fries and drink) and my son the tenders.

The flavor was pretty good and I enjoyed it, the sandwich had some tender chicken and the fries were seasoned.   My wife finished only half the wrap and took the rest home, but she enjoyed the flavors and the chicken and had nothing bad to say about it.  My son's tenders had a sauce that gave it a color that was less than attractive (more brown than red) you figure out what he was calling it...rhymed with herd.

He said the flavor was okay but would opt for a different sauce since they have around six to choose from.  The people were friendly and let me take tons of photos which I am sharing.  I would say it was a decent lunch.</Review><gmapID>0x80c287eded6e47eb:0xa4021fd791ed9da9< /gmapID><UserId.>101286251527560765061< /UserId.><Pictures>None</Pictures>< rate>

I'll admit, these guys are not the cheapest. BUT, I think it's worth every penny. This chicken is absolutely amazing. I got the three piece tenders with traditional buffalo sauce and a beer to wash it all down. I was in heaven. There's a nice seating area and a bar area to sit and watch a game. My husband and I will most certainly be back.</review>

Ordered naked wings they are breaded and lack flavor, I guess if you order them sauced they might work, but if fresh they need to season the flower prior to frying them, if they are frozen I guess you get what you get. The hot (Buffalo) sauce lacked flavor, the BBQ sauce tasted straight from a bottle. The staff was personable and friendly, the food needs to be a notch better for me to visit again.< /Review>

Super friendly staff. Decided to try this place out on a Friday night. Good seating and the fight was on. Ordered the wings with garlic fries, a couple of kids meals. Seasoning was great and the portions were great. There was indoor and outdoor seating large beer selection on tap. Definitely try it out.< /Text>

I am giving five stars for the deliciousness of the burger, prompt service, and friendly staff. They did accidentally give me the wrong fries, but that’s not the end of the world. (It was takeout so I didn’t realize until I got home) Will definitely be coming back here though. Best burger I’ve had in a LONG while.<//Review>

Ordered some mozzarella sticks which were really good but very overpriced. Those with a  drink were basically $12 and they were very tiny things and only 6 of them. They did taste good though and the staff was super friendly.</review>

I needed to order my wings cooked to crispy. Will give them another try. Flavors were good, Blue Cheese Dressing was excellent.<//text>

10/10 I stop by here pretty often and meet up with friends to hang out. The food is awesome and I love the atmosphere, the staff are super friendly and the restaurant is always clean. The wings can get pretty hot. Atomic is really good if you don’t like it too hot, but if you want something that burns and tastes awesome I suggest thermo... Best wings in SCV 👌🏻<//review>

They didn’t have buffalo wing sauce and they are a buffalo wing place. Okay, one strike. We ordered burgers and the order was wrong.  Okay, we didn’t complain but strike 2.  Burgers were soggy grease sodden, meat weird tasting, buns totally flattened and grease soaked.  One bite and I couldn’t stomach another.  Fries are okay and they show the UFC fight although limited seating and tvs in bad spots.</text>

Definitely the best wings, tenders, sandwiches, burgers, nachos, and fries in the greater Los Angeles area. 100% worth the drive to Santa Clarita from any part of LA.<//Text>

<Text>Very expensive, service was no good, and food isn't great. Waiting in line, it seemed there was very little area to stand and we were tripping over the table and chairs behind us. Then ordering I was blown away by the bill of over $50 for a family of four and that's with one soda and three waters. We spend less money at Rattlers BBQ getting the big Round up deal. For myself, I ordered 10 wings and the cost was $15!! At Buffalo Wild Wings, 10 wings is only $10!! Plus at BWW, you get carrots and celery while your waiting and at Rattlers you get rolls. At Wicked Chicken you sit there starving.

Regarding the taste, some of the wings were good, but others were over cooked and the chicken was dry. My kids ordered burgers which I guess we're good, but I didn't care for their fries. My wife ordered a chicken sandwich and I guess it got messed up and took an extra 15 minutes for her to get her food. When I went to check on her sandwich, the owner could have handed it to me, but instead walked by me and brought it to the table. My wife and I both felt that was weird. He did offer her a beer or drink which she declined and I feel he should have offered a free meal. Lastly, the owner was trying to be cool with the high school sports team that was in there and I heard him say a few bad words. Can this place get any worse?< /Text><response>{'time': 1556735818471, 'text': 'Hi Brian, so sorry you were not satisfied with your experience. We strive to make each customer happy but we know everyone is entitled to their opinion! Just for clarity though if you look at the pricing at BWW you will find 9 wings for $14.29. Additionally they use 1oz wings and we serve 10 2oz. From a cost to value perspective believe we are in a good spot. We do provide celery with our wings as well. We are happy to offer you a free sandwich from your last experience should you care to come back. If not we understand that not all will like our food and that is ok but certainly don’t want to leave you without a solution. Lastly the comment regarding the owner trying to be cool really isn’t a factor in the food quality but yes the owner is well known in the SCV community as well as the local BJJ community and if you heard a bad word or two we apologize if that offended you in any way!!'}</response><user_name>Brian Bramer< /user_name><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< rate>

<Review>Very over-priced. Ordered the wrap, supposed to come with avacado, there was none and asked to hold the bacon, they did not. Also had rude help, pointing and talking behind their hands as we were leaving because we bussed our own table, which we thought we were supposed to do, since there was trash cans on the way out with "Thank You" on them.Won't be back.< /Review><response>None< /response><user_name>Patty Miller< /user_name><GmapID>0x80c287eded6e47eb:0xa4021fd791ed9da9< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Was in Santa Clarita for work and needed a dinner break. Found them through Google. Pics really caught my attention. Was a lil skeptical about the pricing, but I gotta say the California Cheeseburger and onion rings were well worth it! Will definitely visit again when I'm in the area again!< /text>

<pics>None</pics><Text>One of the best smoke shops in Sacramento for low to mid range glass, the common smokers dream. They have carrying cases, glass, trays, nicotine and more. This shop can be your one stop shop. Not usually up to date with everything, but once informed they try to stock it. Definitely recommend making the drive whether your just up the road or a few miles out, gaga is definitely a stop worth making!<//Text><Date>1616473685969<//Date>< UserId.>

Terrible customer service. I was a regular customer. I realized that the coils I bought were the wrong size. All I wanted to do was exchange them for the right size. The package was unopened and in good condition. The wrong ones were even more expensive than the ones I need. They refused to make any exchange because I paid cash and didn't have a receipt. I will find a new store with better service.< /Text>

<Text>I was there yesterday and it was my first time because I travel full time.
Amazing Customer service!!!!
The guy was ABSOLUTELY nice. He directed me to the right product, let me try and once I chose which one I wanted he explained in details how to use.
He also told me what I was doing wrong with my old device and I could prevent the coil from burning in the future.
He explained to me how the store and the manufacture warranty works .
I believe he said he was from Afghanistan.  Really knowledgeable person.
Ask for him if you go there.<//Text>< user>

Turns out it just needed to be cleaned well. They were incredibly nice and helpful there. Beautiful store and lots of merchandise to choose from. Planning to stop by again soon....it seemed like a really nice smoke shop. Been to a few smoke shops in the Sacramento area and this one seemed better than the others I have visited. Highly recommended visiting this location!!!< /text>< gmap_id>

Its lovely inside with all the dazzeling glass. I love taking others there for the first time. They have a huge variety and actually the biggest I've ever been into. I can always get what I need there, with top notch service. The workers always show their customers the newest products and I appreciate that. What i like also is its a little private which I appreciate as well, thanks guys<//review>

< review>
This is a fairly large smoke shop. They sell herbal supplements, vape items, cigars, smoking pipes and water pipes. You can get s small smoking pipe for $10 or spend $100+ on a Hookah. They also have cigarettes but you should quit those. They sell glass pieces made by local artist. I found a small glass spoon pipe made by someone in my home town for $30. Plus it glows in the dark!

Small children are allowed in on a case by case basis. This shop does require you to be at least 18 years old, and 21+ to buy most of items. So leave the kids at home.

Mask is required for entry.<//review>

I have been to smoke shops all over the state. I must admit this is probably the best one out of all. Ali and his staff are knowledgeable, polite, and friendly. There is a cigar room with a vast selection of mid to fine cigars at great prices. Ear, belly, and tongue rings. They have colored contacts. Jars and childproof packagaing. They have a huge array of custom local double thick glass pipes and bongs for the amount other shops sale their thin china glass molds for. Look for a vast array of dabb rigs, titanium and quartz bangers, and glass and tools and carb caps too. Hooka? Coals? Flavors? Hookah carry bags? They got a huge selection... Seen some custom blown ninja turtle and other comic pieces... Vast selection of silicone based bongs and pipes as well. Do you vape? They have new and replacement parts and any juice from alot of different makers. Need a blunt? Papers? Bet they got what you use... All natural? Organic? Need a scale. System cleanse? I can't express how well stocked for your smoking needs that they are. Come in and check them out. You will be extremely happy you did. The place is well built. It is well lit. You will get low pricing at an upscale place. Tell me where you can find that anywhere else?< /Text>

<review>Very impressed with this smoke shop. Very clean, organized, and service that feels more like family.  Actually noticed from street and my brother convinced me stop. Glad we did as I finally found a great vape that perfect for me and at a great price. Even better surprise was the humidor. I'm a huge cigar fan and they had many of my favorite premium stogies. The selection is great with maduros and natural wrappers, they even had some infused flavored premiums.</review>< Pics>

Came in an was welcomed & helped right away. Enormous selection of disposable vapes, vape juices, and of course vape mods; they have a variety of brands for all of the products. Great prices & customer service, purchased 3 disposables and told me to test in store, one tasted burnt so he replaced it, same one tasted burnt and got both replaced. Thank you guys for a great shopping experience, will be returning.</review>

<Text>Reasonable crew and enjoyable lobby/shopping floor playlist. Artworks vary as they get restocked (as they should) so it's fun to browse no matter what you come in searching for. The center island displays aid in the transition between product categories for exploring customers; without blocking the shop-keep's ability to watch over their stock.

Thanks to this considerate floor layout, customers won't feel claustrophobic. But you're probably going to have to ask for help to find what you're looking for!< /Text>< Pics>

Tremendous selection of vapes! I was particularly interested in their cannabis oil vapes and I was blown away by the amount of different brands they stock! The customer service was amazing! They patiently answered all of my questions. I kept asking to look at every different brand and I never felt rushed. I wanted to know the voltage specs and they would open the boxes to fish out the paperwork for me to read. I was probably being a pain but they were polite, friendly and patient! There really can't be a better vape shop!<//review>

<Review>Absolutely love this place. Have bought many pieces from here and will always come back. The one star review is obviously from an idiot who doesn't understand smoke shop etiquette, but the customer service has never been any less than stellar for me and my family.

Vape central. These guys are very knowledgeable when it comes to anything about smoking and vapeing. Go there, ask and be informed. Then buy because that is what they do. Sell you smoke stuff.< /Text>

My rating would be better if you carried the type of coil my Kangertech SubVod vape takes. Or the brand of eliquid that I vape. The service was ok on my second visit. On my first visit you didn't open up on time so I waited around for 20 mins.< /text>

<userid>100705967133796329214< /userid><review>I don't smoke weed or anything but this place definitely stocks plenty of great cigars that I normally smoke so, lucky me I don't have to cross town anymore. Cool thing is unless the cigar is really rare they will stock the cigar you request so most of what they have are customer requested. The cigars are a little pricey I grant you, but I prefer to have cigars in 20 minutes versus 2 hours, and they're not snobby about the cigars either.</review>< Time>

<text>I have been going to this place for as long as I have been in Sacramento, which is nearly 3 years. But after how I was treated today I will never go back and I live right around the corner. The person got mad because I open the lockless case to inspect a piece that I haven't seen before. Then he accused me of trying to break it when I was putting it away. Then told me that I couldn't smell a cigar before I bought it. Mind you, there are no signs, locks, or anything stating any weird policy of what this guy was claiming. So Instead of getting the cloves I went in there for I walked out of the stale ass excuse for a cigar room and told my wife that we were leaving and never coming back. I don't appreciate being discriminated against for any reason, no excuse.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>
{'time': 1524714428918, 'text': 'I’m sorry you had a bad experience in our store.\n\nBut a word of advice, unless you are about to smoke the cigar, never take cigars out of their plastic wraps the oils from fingers will ruin it. If you have questions about any product simply ask us that’s why we are there for, don’t go on and unwrap the cigars. It’s like going to the grocery store and opening cereal boxes, it is just not right and it’s common sense. And the same goes for our glass.\nAnyway we appreciate your visit to our establishment.\n\nThank you\n\nAttalie'}< /Resp>

<pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><Text>gets the job done but it's pretty expensive for a hand blown piece. spoon pipes are a nice price.  I bought a vaporizer, it leaked on me so I had to exchange it, this one leaked on me again and now it does not work at all so I am disappointed I spent the money because I know they won't exchange it one last time. I purchased it on 1/20/17 and replaced it once already, I know they didn't like replacing it either so I felt pretty terrible inside. it leaked 2 times initally because of a bad coil I bought from there, before it was the mod I had to replace and the coil I purchased from there in a 5 pack leaked yet again, destroying the mod yet again. I used it once or twice a week. it's past the 7 day purchase date, the coils I bought from there destroyed it, I know they don't make the coils but that's really bad luck. I unscrewed the back to make sure and it's because of the faulty coil that juice got inside of the mod. I have an extra coil but I guess I'll toss it. I don't think I can trust replacing this one with another from there unless the unit was replaced but it's too late now I'm sure......overall it's ok, at least they were kind to me. I don't want to be a difficult customer for them so I won't burden them with this experience.<//Text>< userid>

Yesterday 4/23/2017 I walked into Gaga smoke shop and asked to purchase an incense burner. I was looked up and down by the employee and he said we don't sell them. I said oh really since when? He said they have never sold them. I replied with interesting because my husband and I came in 3 weeks ago and purchased one? He again told me they didn't sell them. Fast forward to today 4/24/2017 as we are driving past he says go ahead and stop because I'm going to go in to buy one. Guess what? HE WALKED OUT WITH ONE. If they don't and have never sold them then how were we able to purchase one 3 weeks ago and again just ONE day after telling me that they don't sell them was my husband able to buy one?
I am a normal attractive blonde female, had my ID card stating I'm 25, I had payment and he wouldn't sell to me why? That's what I truly would like to know. So why GAGA smoke shop wouldn't you sell to me but sold one to my husband. I wasn't rude until I was blantantly lied to by the employee who treated me like a liar and like I was stupid.
All customers should be treated equally especially when they are right. I still am at a loss for words on why my business wasn't accepted and would truly like an explanation. If I can be told why I was lied to and turned away, I will edit my review. But until I get an explanation and an apology, this review is going to stay up for the world to see.< /Review>

<pics>None< /pics><text>everyone there working is super knowledgeable and he have so many different options to choose from... Whether you're talking a new tank with your existing mod, or a wax attachment with Slimmer style battery for a discrete sneak -a- toke in a hurry, you name it with all glass work they sell oil burners in 3 sizes color & clear, water pipes galore, tabacco gurgs with so many colors to choose to chose any from the top of the line best deal to the most sturdy piece that would be more like collectable artwork than not.... You wont be disappointed, this shop stays opened pretty late & well worth the travel if u need to get ro Gaga's. Always had 0 problems with bringing back a defective item by chance, they definately go the extra mile to make sure customers leave with a smile & return back thirtsy for more.

Honestly, i have not had a single staff not be able to answer all my random questions about how the vape fires, and l the components work together so i can get the optimum performance within quickest amount of working time, etc. Only had 1 question unanswered EVER.  & that was regarding CBD vape juice bottle (once i got home the label has the info in sub script so it was there for me when needed to reload...

Have left with all the components pointed out so i know how to do it myself. Seriously, they can do package deals on the fly 4 cheap if u get 3+ things together with a triple digit tab, ask em to hook ya up!! Good luck, be safe and most of all enjoy your visit inside !!!< /text></record></dataset><record>

Was in the today and got treated almost as if I was stealing. If you don't want customers to look closer at any products put locks on the glass. Don't treat customers like criminals they will walk out and never come back.</review>

If you have questions about any product simply ask us that’s why we are there for, don’t go on and unwrap the cigars. It’s like going to the grocery store and opening cereal boxes, it is just not right and it’s common sense.

Glass products are not worth it. Bought a beaker bottom water pipe for $120 cracked around where the downstem fits within the first couple of torches and then cracked around the neck changing the water out. The burgerking cup bubbler $60 same thing. Torched the ceramic nail and another crack. Will be driving the extra mile to go to millenium now....<//Text>

<review>My Armenian non engliah speaking friend came here and got took for $160.

They sold him a Kangertech Sub box mini 60 watts for $116! Its only worth $60 everywhere else. They sold him 4 batteries also, why? The sub box mini only takes 1 battery, 2 would have been enough.

Be careful when you purchase from these guys, and I emplore you to shop around first.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><GmapID>0x809add83e79a5347:0x7409459d762acf9e<//GmapID>< time>

We’re from out of town, just here visiting. Decided to take a chance here an it paid off! They are wonderful, they did an awesome job on my feet an my nails. They also did my daughters nails, they pampered her and made her feel comfortable with the process because it was her first time. I definitely suggest to come here! Will be coming back again!<//text>

Very disappointed with this place, the owner was in a hurry did not take the time to take the  dry skin off from both my, heals, when I addresses it to the owner the owner just added oil to my heal and said  to put lotion on my heal when I get home. Not happy with the results and will not be going back and would not recommend to anyone.< /Text>

The 2 star rating is not due to the quality provided but the lack of communication. I was a walk in to get my eyebrows waxed. I work near the area and wanted to stop by on my way out of work. I thought the lady did a very lovely job. I paid with a $100 bill and when she handed me back my change, I asked if I could give her a tip. She thought I was accusing her of not giving me the proper change and taking money from me. I repeated myself a few times to try to explain to her that I wanted to leave a tip and this lady got very upset with me. Kept saying "I didn't take your money!" She caused a scene due to the misunderstanding and it was an embarrassing experience for me. I just wanted to leave a tip...geez. Will not be returning back.< /Text>

I was reading the reviews, and I’ve noticed that somehad mentioned that the place is bug infested. Bug infested!? What place in this day and age doesn’t have a problem with bugs? I’ve been living here for a year now, and I have not had any issues or anything. Occasionally I will see a huge bug here or two,but I only see them during the time of the year when it starts to get hot and these creatures have no other choice but to come  in from intense heat temperatures. And to be perfectly honest, in the summertime I have had an issue with ants but then again ants are common in the summer time as well. I think the key to making sure that the place is kept up without it being bug infested is for people to learn how to care for their own individual units. If you take care of your own unit and keep it clean that’s including the bathroom kitchen as well as kitchen cabinets and try to keep them sanitized, then that would minimize the use of bugs crawling in or else some people would say bug infested. I’ve been living here for a year and so far it’s been very Nice and quiet.My neighbors are very friendly, and they seem to care about me individually as a person since I’m disabled as one of my neighbors stated or it describe my unit as our own little individual fish aquarium so this is a nice place to live and I love that it’s nice and quiet and yes there are plenty of activities for those would like to get involved.But,overall,  i’m very thankful and happy that I was given the opportunity to move here I live in a single unit and it is not overcrowded and I’m loving every bit of living in my little tiny home or crackerjack home and some have called it LOL! 😊< /text>

A really lovely community for seniors. It's well maintained and my FIL likes it. All the people I've met have been friendly and kind, and people look out for each other. Apartments are small but cozy, and rent is reasonable.<//text>

<review>I have lived at Mayflower Gardens for around five years. I am so happy I can write a review of it. It is such a wonderful place to live. Besides all the wonderful amenities you get to have your own garden. You can have a pet which is such a blessing. There is a deposit of course, so worth it. There are so many great things here. A really nice restaurant with great food. They will even deliver to you for a dollar. They have a video room where you can get a movie and bring it back. There is an immense library with the same thing. A beauty shop. Game room. Work out room. Computer room. Small conveinance store. Thrift shop, non denominatonal church, Another wonderful church brings food to those who need it on Friday's.There is a nice pool surrounded by trees,there is a bus that goes around that will give you a ride. They have different fun events all the time. There are day trips to great places too. A monthly magazine comes to your door once a month to let you know what is going on that month. I forgot to say that it is covered in big pretty trees too~love that, Well, that is all I have to say for now. Oh yes, the staff are so nice too. A great place to live if you are looking!!<//review></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
I wanted to leave a review bc I love this shop! I got a double nostril piercing a year ago here, and went back today to get my medusa pierced. I called and was able to get in the same day. The people are really nice there, professional and make you feel comfortable. I'd definitely recommend this shop!
Also i'm horrible with remembering names but the girl that pierced me was really sweet, would 100% recommend!</Review>

Juan is the BEST! He is efficient, talented, kind and extremely generous. Had the pleasure of getting this work done by him for the Nor Cal tattoo expo! Took only 9 hours to do this piece. He’s worth so much more than what he charges. Honestly had the best tattoo experience of my life at the expo. Juan and his lady Tracie took care of me so well while I was under the needle. I will definitely be getting more work done by him in the future.<//text>

If they give you a 100 or 200 dollar spread expect the higher price even if you shrink the tattoo or it doesn't take very long to do. Maybe get the estimate in writing so they will remember what they quoted. Tattoos look very good. Just expensive for the time and size.<//review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Wanted to like this place but didn’t have a great experience. Took way too long to make my sandwich (20 minutes) and they forgot the bacon too (I’m sure I paid an extra $2-3 for that). Staff didn’t even apologize for my long wait. And Sandwich wasn’t that good. Can’t speak about the coffee though.</review>

<review>This place needs to be higher than what it is. Their coffee is good but it's their smoothies and breakfast sandwiches I think is where they make their money. Don't waste your time getting a breakfast burrito from a coffee shop. Get real people. They only have this to make people happy. They are like Einstein's but better.<//review>< Rating>

Comfortable setting, great sandwiches, and a nice vibe. New ownership too and they're putting in a lot of effort to renovate and modernize the space.

The coffee was seriously delicious and had a nice buttery flavor. I find myself craving more of it today and want to go back to get some. Will return.< /Text>

<Time>1449282197294< /Time><Rating>4</Rating><review>Most non chain coffee shops are small by nature and such is the case here, but something that will probably give you pause and stop your order in it's tracks is the food menu. It's the largest coffee shop food menu I've seen with a few dozen breakfast and lunch sandwich's. I don't drink that much coffee as I try and stay away from caffeine, but it's a great regroup point for my longer rides from Oceanside.

Dog Friendly.

Probably some of the best service for a coffee shop around. While enjoying the patio someone will come out and ask if you need anything else, refills, napkins, etc. That's waiter service and at a coffee shop. To me the size and set up limit if from getting 5 starts, but the menu, price and service put it well above most places which are all about convenience.

Inside can get crowded and be a bit chaotic. They have excellent iced coffees. With Juice Nation nearby taking care of the juice crowd they here have focused more on the smoothie side of things because most juicers put aside the flavor for the benefits, not the case for the overly caffeinated.

Red, White bagel is classic even if overly priced, I go with the deluxe with the turkey, it's less breakfast that way. Tuna melt to me is quite good despite many people hating tuna, their mayo is subtle. It's not a sandwich shop, but it's quite a menu for a coffee shop. They do catering. Parking can suck despite being the center attraction, the other business tend to lock up the spaces spcificly adjacent to them.

Free Wifi and maybe it's me, but the lot always seems to be in, well paved condition.<//review>< pictures>

Had breakfast there yesterday and they ran out of bagels so I had to get a cheddarjalapeño bagel which was the only one that had left . Unfortunately this store became super expensive which used to be different so it’s not a Café i can go to everyday . But the bagels and the coffee are really good !< /text>

Fun place, but overrated. Lots of really sweet drinks and the espresso is too dark and burnt (bitter Macchiatto and Cappuccino drinks).</Text>

< Review>
Incredible purchasing experience! As a client on the other side of the country, I couldn't have asked for more. I was greeted by friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful staff each time I called. My questions were answered promptly and I received all the info I needed to make a confident buying decision, including additional videos and photos of the item I was interested in. I received my item next day— exactly as pictured. It arrived with a hand-written note in a charming ring box. The only thing more impressive than the customer service was the gorgeous vintage ring I received. I will certainly be a return customer at Lang!< /Review>

< Review>
We are so excited and the ring is an absolute show stopper. I couldn't have asked for a pettier ring and not to mention the down home customer service you provided during this whole process. I was extremely lucky to have found a place that treated me more like family than a customer. Kaye and everyone on the team there at Lang overlooked every aspect and caught issues before they materialized. I would strongly recommend Lang Antiques.< /Review>

<review>In this day and age, global online shopping is more common than not.  One must rely upon the clarity of an image and the accuracy of its description.  Lang does this and more.  Lang provides concierge services in a gracious, accommodating, and professionally poised manner.  My interactions with and purchases from Lang have consistently met the highest of standards.  I should note Lang's Antique Jewelry "University":  an online educational resource that's just a click away.  This feature addresses jewelry history and jewelry marks; it also has an extensive glossary (Everything A - Z).   Research may be conducted at one's leisure and it's a wonderful complement to their steadfast endeavor:  to make one's "vintage jewelry dreams come true."< /review><user_id>102908253858664454694<//user_id><Rate>5<//Rate>< Resp>

<Text>I had such an incredible experience with Lang Antiques!! Kaye was especially amazing and made purchasing my fiancé’s dream engagement ring so special. She was able to get the ring shipped to me overnight on short notice, and made sure to check in with me every step of the process, as it was my first (and hopefully only!) time purchasing an engagement ring. I can’t wait to visit San Francisco again to stop in and say hello!</Text>< pictures>

Lang has exquisite items. We love the Art Nouveau necklace we purchased.  They extended the original gold chain for us, which was not an easy task. The chain had a "bloom finish," popular in that time. But bloom replacement links are not available. Nevertheless, they found links that matched the chain beautifully. Kaye is awesome to work with...ask for her!</text>

I have made several purchases from Lang Antique & Estate Jewelry online over the past year, and I couldn't be more thrilled in every way. It can be "nervewracking" to make a large jewelry purchase online. They were helpful in sending additional pictures when asked, and answering all my questions. They kept me well informed about when my item was shipping, and when every item arrived, I have to say, I was more pleased and excited about the item when I saw it in person! They are amazing, and the only place I shop for jewelry anymore!!</text>

<username>Peggy Alvarez-Prater</username><Date>1603933876211< /Date><Rate>5< /Rate><Text>Buying an expensive piece of forever antique jewelry sight unseen – online – seemed like an intimidating and overwhelming prospect to me:  there were so many online options, so who would I select and how would I know if the seller was reputable and was selling me an authentic antique/vintage piece?
Lucky for me I found Lang Antiques online!  Your excellent customer service and friendly and knowledgeable sales team, along with your 10-day return policy for a full refund, took the worry out of my purchase!
I can’t say enough about the beautiful forever antique ring Nicole and Edward helped me select and how they took the stress and concerns out of shopping for it online.  I am a very happy customer, and I will be purchasing from Lang Antiques for years to come! Thank you! Peggy P.</Text>< pics>

<date>1599242340812< /date><Rate>5</Rate><text>What a wonderful experience I had with Nicole at Lang.  I had found a ring online that I was interested in purchasing for my wife for our anniversary.  Nicole was extremely helpful and answered all of my questions.  This wasn't an inexpensive purchase and at first, I was a bit nervous about doing this online.  Nicole's professionalism and goodhearted nature was the icing on the cake that led me to take the plunge.  I couldn't be happier with the ring and my wife is over the moon.  I wholeheartedly recommend Lang to anyone looking for that special piece.< /text>< pictures>

I spent a week picking out an engagement ring with Lang, they answered my questions about it and I agreed to buy it. While finalizing the payment, Lang sold the ring out of their shop to someone off the street.

Wildly unprofessional the way this occurred.<//review>

Fabulous experience.  Shopping for gems via a web page was intimidating.  But in this case it was with no worries.  The item was exactly as picture on the web site.  Answers were quickly provided for my questions prior to purchasing.  Fabulous communication during the temporary shut down during COVID.  Shipping was handled expertly.  I will be shopping there soon for my next treasure.< /text>

Lang Antique has a customer for life. Their staff are extremely knowledgeable, helpful, and patient. Customer service is impeccable, and their selection of vintage estate jewelry is amazing. After spending weeks looking for an engagement ring online and in showrooms all over the Bay Area, my now wife and I knew we had found something special at Lang... a beautiful original handmade 1920s or 1930s Art Deco diamond engagement ring. We knew that we wanted a one-of-a-kind ring with a history, and after viewing this one at Lang, we found ourselves comparing every other ring we then saw to it. It was actually the first piece of fine jewelry I ever bought, and a little over my initial budget, but it was one of the best purchases I've ever made. My wife loves it and we'll cherish it as our first real family heirloom together.

Thank you to Natalia, Nicole, and the rest of the Lang team!<//review>

I discovered Lang on Pinterest and visited their website. I found a gorgeous estate ring and emailed for more information. Nicole Corsini responded very quickly with the answers to my questions. A day or two later Nicole contacted me to let me know they would be having a sale in a couple of days and the piece I was interested in would be 20% off. My husband and I took a few days to decide on the purchase and, after deliberating, he purchased it by mail for our anniversary!! The ring came beautifully boxed, on the date quoted, with no issues. It is even more stunning than the photos! I’m extremely pleased with the excellent service, professionalism, and patience Nicole displayed. There was no pressure to buy and she even offered to send more pictures. She was a joy to work with and I will definitely recommend Lang to others!!</Text>

The extensive wrapping is pretty and it is a real treasure hunt to open box after box. My husband also thinks it is very perfect. I am small so the set is not too overpowering and the earrings light in weight.
Thank you for your attention, service and kindness in all this. I hope to purchase more in the future.
Again, I value the set and the experience with Nicole and Lang Jewelers.

We went to Lange 3 times before we bought a ring. Never did we feel rushed, never pressured, and never made to feel bad after walking out without a purchase.

Well 3rd times a charm and we found the perfect match. Timothy Flowers was such a great person to work with. He's professional, cheery, and most importantly patient!

I will no doubt go back to them in the future, what an amazing collection Lange has. I highly recommend them.< /text>

While searching for ring designs, I came across a truly stunning estate black opal and diamond ring, set in platinum, on Lang’s website.  The large number of pictures, including of it being worn, were true-to-life and easily convinced me that I would love to own the ring.  The very reasonable price sealed the deal. Nicole at Lang made the process super easy — I used the chat function to inquire about resizing the ring, and then called her to complete the transaction.  Lang was able to resize it (complimentary) and ship it to me, and it arrived in less than a week from purchase.  The ring fits perfectly and is even more stunning in person.  I couldn’t be happier and I will definitely head to their website first in the future for jewelry needs.< /Text>

Working with Lang Antique & Estate Jewelry was an easy and wonderful experience.  I had heard about them through a referral who told me that they had engagement diamond rings in the price range that I was looking for and in the style I desired the most.

I didn't know what to expect but when going through the website, there were pieces I found myself very interested in!   However, I live in MA and they are in San Francisco so I assumed the process would be way too difficult and I wouldn't be able to work with them.  That was, until I called them...

Nicole Corsini made purchasing my engagement ring easy, fun and stress free.   Because I live far away, she explained and made me feel comfortable about shipping rings across the coast and how easy the return was if I didn't like the piece.   She also explained I could do it as many times as I wanted and have even a few rings shipped to me at once to decide from.

After telling her which rings I liked from the website, she immediately took clearer photos and videos of them to give me a better sense of what they looked like!  It was easier to narrow down which ring I liked the best!  Her photos were as if I was in the room trying them on.   Then they shipped the ring!

After trying on only one ring, I fell in love and was sold!

Lang Antiques was very professional from the beginning.   Made the process of making an important decision very easy having been no where near them.   When they shipped the ring to me after it was resized (FOR FREE), it was during a very bad snowstorm.  There was someone from the company who emailed me about the delay of the delivery, clearly tracking the package with me too!  I was very impressed by that.

Lang also offers a layaway program which was very helpful to me and my new fiance!   We were given a few months to pay it off instead of doing it all in one shot.    I felt safe throughout the entire process.   I highly recommend working with them even if you live nowhere near San Franciso.  The distance didn't matter.    Nicole was amazing and I am truly grateful!

I utterly adore Lang Antiques, partly because of the stunning collection they have and partly due to the amazing team, particularly Nicole. She would often follow up and make sure I felt supported and helped me on my journey to find the right ring for me. I felt connected to her despite being on the other side of the world in Oz! It’s a major financial decision purchasing jewelry when you can’t see or touch it in real life, but Lang Antiques make you feel like you’re right there and they are with you all the way. I cannot wait to get my antique ring for my milestone birthday!! Favourite online store ever. I’m obsessed!
Thank you so much! Kylie<//Review>

The bland selection of jewelry in most contemporary stores frustrates me.  By contrast, Lang is a curated gallery of the best of many different styles and eras, in every price range.

A peruse of the website, with excellent high-resolution photos, gives you an introduction.  But, I recommend a visit in person.  Far from intimidating, the friendly staff will be happy to fill you in.  It’s fun to discover what you like.

My wife, two daughters, and daughter-in-law – each with different tastes – have been surprised and delighted with gifts I have found at Lang.  They often get calls on their jewelry, which makes them – and me – feel great.  We enjoy sending our friends to Lang.< /review>

<Text>Lang has a large selection of quality collectible jewelry and keepsakes. There are mainly one of a kind items. It is where I go to find inspiration--a very special gift. The sales personnel could not be more helpful and friendly, certainly no sense of pressure. Pre-shop on the Web and purchase something truly worth giving or treasuring..</Text>< Gmap_id>

<text>There is no place more fun to visit than Lang, Especially if you are a fan of gorgeous, antique jewelry. It’s always been a dream to actually buy something from Lang. I happen to be a fan of brown diamonds. I found the most gorgeous hexagon cut, brown diamond I’d ever seen at Lang. It now sits happily on my ring finger. Not only do I love looking at it every single day, I love that I get to pop into Lang at anytime to have them clean it for me, of which they always do with a smile. San Francisco is changing immensely but Lang continues to be one of the true treasures in San Francisco!< /text><rate>5< /rate>< user_id>

Thrilled is an understatement! I was searching for my birthstone, Aquamarine, at many antique jewelers! I’ve heard of Lang Antiques before but didn’t think the price would be in my budget. I found a 4-1/2 carat Aquamarine set in Platinum with 1/4 carat rows of Diamond flanking this exquisite emerald cut Aquamarine stone! This was my 65th Birthday gift - from the best Jeweler in the city I was born in, San Francisco, and made during the era of my birth, 1950s.

Great staff, service is outstanding and beyond expectations! Nicole sent extra photos and was thoroughly knowledgeable about my ring. Sizing was a breeze and the follow up was truly exemplary! Lang truly cares about their customers. I recommend Lang for any jewelry purchase - a fantastic experience!

Thank you Lang Antiques!!</review>

<text>This was a really neat visit, as we unexpectedly came across this nice little shop on an aimless walk around the city.

Very friendly staff, even likely understanding that we weren't terribly likely to make a purchase. They understood this, but also humored and entertained my spouse, who is somewhat knowledgeable about fine jewelry.

Very nice selection, well shown, and at seemingly reasonable prices. I'd like to visit again in the future and hope to leave with something to show for it.< /text><date>1548619837273</date><Rating>5< /Rating>< GmapID>

<text>Great service from incredibly knowledgable staff. They spent a ton of time with us helping us find the perfect engagement ring, and then my wedding band.

A++ would recommend. You can't beat them for range or price in the US.< /text>< user_id>

I discovered Lang on 1st dibs and then visited the shop the next time I was in S F.  It is an Aladdin’s cave of jewels, a collection spanning many different periods. I’ve bought something every time I visit and will continue to do so. If you are a collector, it’s a shop full of like minded people. If you are just looking for that special piece you will definitely find it there. They also have a very easy to navigate website with great photos.</text>

I've been following their amazing instagram profile, and when I returned home to NoCal, I popped in---without any notification, just to see their merch in person. They couldn't have been MORE WELCOMING to this (now) Texan with her cowboy boots and drawl......such amazing, welcoming staff----they made me feel part of their gem 'club' ----and were so wonderfully patient with me during the decision making process. I bought my Sphene and Diamond ring sight unseen, and it was EXACTLY as described----in fact, more beautiful than they had implied!! Trust these experts----they know gems, they know customers, and they know value!!!!</review>

Lang has positively impressed me with every aspect of the purchasing process.  Their website is fantastic, easy to use, and has accurate photos and descriptions.  Their customer service is second to none.  They make me feel like a friend as well as a customer.  I have made several purchases over the past months and have been delightfully surprised with the quality and presentation for each one.  I would and have recommended Lang antiques as a trusted web site and store for speciality jewelry.  They truly provide an “OMG” experience and product.<//text>

<Review>Lang has an incredible selection of fine vintage jewelry.  I narrowed my engagement ring selection down to two choices on the web.    They discussed the two options in great detail and even sent me side by side photos and videos.  I chose an old mine cut solitaire that is unlike any other old mine cut I've ever seen.

We happened to be in the area after I proposed, so we went in and met the person who was helping us out.  They are even going to size it for free when she is ready to let it go for a week and will send it back to us in Chicago.  Couldn't have been happier</Review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x8085808940c86ed9:0xbface2695c6fb300<//Gmap_id></record>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>Lang has an amazing selection of vintage and antique jewelry accompanied by exceptional customer service!

I had been eyeing this store through their Instagram site for a while, and when my fiance and I went in to browse for engagement rings they did not disappoint. They have an amazing selection that is well curated and organized, and they get in new stock frequently. They do have very high end jewelry, but also many quite affordable rings in a good range for every budget.

Our sales associate, Molly, was knowledgeable, friendly, patient, and fun. She indulged me as I tried on many, many rings (and a few bracelets and necklaces...), and I never felt like she was trying to rush me in a decision, but at the same time she was really helpful in helping us narrow down our choices and figure out which rings we liked best. I am very indecisive and didn't go into the process knowing exactly which style I wanted, and Molly was also really good at quickly figuring out my taste and suggesting options I was likely to enjoy. We were definitely looking at items in the lowest price range of their selection, but I never felt like we were treated as such. At the end, I was deciding between two rings, and one was almost double the price of the other, but I never felt like I was being nudged to purchase the more expensive one. We ended up with a gorgeous ring that I am so happy with, and we also learned that engagement ring purchases get you a 10% discount on wedding bands.

They are unusual compared to many other antique jewelers in SF in that you can just walk in anytime. We went in on a Tuesday afternoon and had the store almost to ourselves. When we went back on a Thursday it was more crowded, so I might recommend going on an earlier weekday.

We had a great experience at Lang with Molly and the rest of the staff, and I would recommend this place to anyone who wants some unique and beautiful jewelry!!<//Review>< Pics>

I had an absolutely wonderful experience with Lang's buying my new fiance's engagement ring. I dealt with Nicole, specifically, through the easy process of having things resized and answering some questions I had.
...and I did this all from Texas. They were great.</review>

I purchased an engagement ring for my girlfriend in July 2017 online from Lang Antiques. I was looking for something vintage and unique and didn't want to deal with the Diamond District. I came across Lang's website and almost immediately found a ring that I thought would be perfect. I browsed around other shops, but kept coming back to Lang as their information on the ring was thorough and their prices seemed very reasonable. They also have a great return and resizing policy, so I didn't have to worry about getting stuck with a less than perfect ring.

I was hesitant to make such a large purchase online, so I reached out to Lang to inquire more about the ring and resizing. Nicole got back to me right away with more information and even offered to send more photographs of the ring. Even better news, she let me know they were having a Summer Sale on their jewelry. She helped me set up shipping to my Ma's house upstate (no doorman!) and contacted me at each step of the shipping and resizing process. Their website said that resizing can take up to two weeks, but they seemed to have done it overnight!

I proposed during the eclipse in Central Park and my soon to be wife absolutely loved the ring! Nicole followed up with me soon after to see how everything went and if we needed any additional size adjustments. Awesome customer service and a great shop! I highly recommend working with Lang if you are looking for something unique.<//Review>

EXCEPTIONAL SELECTION AND CUSTOMER SERVICE.  I purchased a beautiful Art Deco bracelet for my wife's birthday online, always a risky proposition.  My concerns were eliminated after talking to Angela who went over everything, gave me great information about the bracelet and assured me it could be returned if my wife did not like it.  I called back a few time, NEVER got voice mail, the bracelet arrived on time, beautifully gift wrapped and made my wife's birthday very special.  With annoying voice mail messages and impersonal service a fact of business life, Lang was a breath of fresh air and a wonderful experience that reminded me of the "good old days" when personal service meant something.  If you want to make an impression on your spouse or significant other give Angela a call - she will lavish you with attention, great customer service and a beautiful selection of jewelry that will make a stellar impression.</Review>

I just purchased a beautiful ring from Lang over the internet.  I'd never done that before, but Nicole and the rest of the sales team made it easy.  They couldn't have been more helpful and efficient, and answered my many questions promptly and thoroughly.  The ring is exquisite, and based on my research, the price was very reasonable.  Lang has unique, lovely jewelry.  Overall it was a great shopping experience, and I highly recommend them.<//Text>

<Review>Am having to change my 5 star review to 1.  Since I purchased a large piece from this store over a year ago, I have had to get some minor repair work on it (which is not the issue), turns out, that what I was told and what is stated on the paperwork is not correct, it said Gold and Silver. There is no gold anywhere on this framework, but silver with steel elements. Testing was carried out with Laser and Acid. Diamonds are real but it ends there. Very disappointed that Lang Antiques have not gotten back to me about this issue. Feeling very ripped off, as they have not provided the evidence I asked for to prove there is gold in this framework.< /Review><rate>1< /rate><pics>None</pics>< gmap_id>

<text>Natalia was incredibly helpful in helping my fiancée and I pick out our engagement rings.  She got a feel for our tastes and showed us amazing options to pick from.

Lang has friendly customer service, detailed photos on their website, and a wide selection of pieces.  Will definitely be my initial go to in the future for nice jewelry.

Thanks again Lang!</text></record>

They have an outstanding inventory of estate jewelry, much of which can be viewed online if you want to prepare yourself before visiting the store.  Staff were very helpful in making selections and took as much time as was needed to answer our questions.  We never felt rushed. Both rings in question had to be resized (one was done twice), which was included in the price.  We highly recommend the store.< /Text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

I took it to four other jewelers who delt in estate jewelry in San Francisco. The offers for the ring ranged from 16% to 25% of what I originally bought it for from Lang. I took it back into Lang who offered me 50% of what I purchased it for OR 65% if they held it on consignment.  I know this was do to me purchasing it from them but 50% is still very high for a buyback.  I agreed to let them hold it for me on consignment.  They said I could come back anytime it was on consignment and they would purchase it for 50% of what I originally paid for it.

The people at Lang know there stuff. I asked all the estate jewelers information about the ring, time period, make, how it was made etc.  They all told me some knowledge they knew. Suzanne, at Lang could tell me so much more, about the detail, how it was made, a more specific time period, and you could tell there is a reason why they are the largest estate jewelry dealer in the west cost. She could tell more about the ring than anyone else. She showed and explained how every peace of jewelers the sell is perfect. And if it isn’t they have to repair it to perfection or they wont sell it. They don’t sell anything that is not exceptional. I’m sure they may be a little higher priced than other estate jewelers but there is a reason for it. When it absolutely positively needs to be the best quality estate jewelry, you go to Lang, period.</Review>< name>

I purchased a sapphire engagement ring here (that that has literally stopped traffic when someone saw it on my fiancé) that was in the same price range a chain store would charge for a tiny diamond (again, literally). Service was top tier, could not have been happier. Natalia took a lot of the pressure out of what was a very intimidating experience for me, showing us rings that were in my range and stunning. They fit a ton of stuff in the smallish shop so you are going to find what you are looking for. Highly recommended.< /Review><Rate>5< /Rate><resp>None< /resp><user_name>Gordon Rich</user_name>< Pictures>

<text>Lang Antique & Estate Jewelry is the only place to buy and jewelry.  Not only is every piece a work of art, their prices are better than any other store I have been in.  I've never seen watches in Lang Antique & Estate Jewelry; I make an exception for watches.
This particular location is huge and obviously has the best selection if you are shopping; a great place to dream and a great place to make someone's day!</text><time>1417534111801<//time>< rating>

Elizabeth was so patient and helpful, and we ended up with a stunning Art Deco ring that I couldn’t love more. Lang is worth a special trip.< /review>< resp>

Before getting engaged I told my husband two important things: no diamonds and must be conflict free. I may have also hinted at a company who could help him out :) Danielle worked with him over the phone/email (we are located in socal) to find the perfect stone to go with the band he picked out. My ring is GORGEOUS. Danielle then had the pleasure of working with my picky self to create a custom wedding band. I am SO pleased with how it turned out and both my rings are stunning. Can't recommend this company enough! They are GOOD at what the do.<//review>

<review>After previous trips to inquire about selling and possibly purchasing some of their items, today they were quite dismissive. After instructing me to bring to them a rare and unusual piece  to figure out what to do with it, today they told me upon arrival "that's not what we do."

I will go far out of my way to now locate a firm not nearly as pugnacious as Lang.<//review>< userid>

Amazing exotic vintage jewelry.
Likely one of the best in the US.
Likely to spend many thousands
of $ for a unique piece, but worth
it.</Text>

I encourage locals and out-of-towners to stop in to Lang's, preferably on a weekday when the shop is not neck deep in customers.  No money? No problem. Lang Antiques offers beautiful items at all price points, and usually there are one-of-a-kind items. It is independently owned (i.e., not a piece of some huge corporate conglomerate) and consequently Lang's is all about customer satisfaction. The owner, Suzanne, enjoys high respect from her local and international colleagues, including the large auction houses. Lang's welcomes you to admire, converse with knowledgeable experts with deep insight into the historical significance of gems and objets d'art, and leave with more knowledge and deepened appreciation of wearable antiques as an art form, as living pieces of history, and of the craftsmanship behind what many regard as merely luxury items.

This atelier is beautifully appointed, easy to find, a feast for the eyes, and one of the long-term prides of San Francisco. Enjoy!<//review>

They rip you off when they buy your jewelry! I sold a ring to Lang Antiques and they're selling if for more that twice what they gave me for it. I understand they need to make a profit, but seriously, I sold them a ring for $1200 and they're selling it for $3000??<//text>

My husband recently bought me a ring from Lang Antiques. This was for our anniversary and he told me to find the ring I wanted. I looked for weeks because I had in my mind exactly what I wanted. We went to jewelers and shops . Becoming quite frustrated with the cookie-cutter look of every ring I saw, I decided to look online when I came across Lang Antiques and their website. I wanted something different, something original, something with a story, heritage... and I found it.  This ring is gorgeous and even now I look at it several times a day and think just how lucky I am that my husband bought it for me for our anniversary.

It sparkles and shines and is absolutely beautiful in any light.  What I love most about it is the history behind it, its age, and the fact that it looks completely different than any ring sold today.  It is my very favorite piece of jewelry and I am excited to one day pass it down to my children.

I talk about Lang Antiques to anyone who will listen.  The customer care was phenominal and all my questions were answered in such a timely manner.  Even when the ring went back after sizing to have diamonds reinforced, someone called me to tell me about the delay in shipping and then offered to overnight the ring to me. Spending a sizable amount of money on something sight unseen is a difficult thing but Nicole at Lang assured me and helped with any and every question I had along the way. The pictures posted are true and vivid. The staff is incredible.  All in all, it was a great experience.  Thank you, thank you, thank you for such a beautiful ring that is rich with heritage.  I am so pleased!

I have tiny fingers and a different jeweler we went to was too afraid to resize an antique ring. Lang's resized it in only a few hours because we were traveling from out of town and were leaving in a few days. I love my ring! Excellent and friendly service.< /Text>< pictures>

My girlfriend and I were looking for estate wedding/engagement rings and Lang's by far has the best selection of anyplace in the Bay Area.  The staff is very knowledgable and let US put a ring on hold for 3 days while we thought about our ring.  We continued to look, but at the end of the day my girlfiend kept saying that the rings were as perfect as "my" ring.  I ended up calling Lang's and purchasing the one of a kind ring and we couldnt be happier.  Lang's is definitely the place if you want to find a wedding/engagement ring that is one of a kind and you wont find anywhere else.  We love Lang's and would suggest them to anyone!</text>

Worst Jack in the Box I've ever had the displeasure of visiting. I usually have to wait 20-30 minutes to get my food, 10 on a good day. I keep telling myself it'll be better next time, but it never is. Only gave 2 stars because food is usually hot and pretty fresh.< /review>

This is my favorite place. Week in and week out we can rely on the food and relax in the restaurant for an hour or more comfortably. In a hurry? No problem, these guys can do fast, even when there's a crowd. That's why so many people are, like me, "Regulars."< /review>

Loooooove Jack in the Box! Love their iced coffees, their fries, their burgers, their tacos! So good. It's VERY busy at every Jack in the Box I've been to, so yes, wait times can get wild. But the food is so worth it, I don't mind. Literally love itttt.</review>

1. I waited in the drive-thru for nearly 20minutes.
2. The fries were warm at best.
3. The bun on my sourdough jack wasn't even toasted.
I keep telling myself "It's going to be good this time" and it never is.< /text>

I went last night at 1am, hopeful that because it was late they wouldn't be too busy. There were 2 cars in front of me and I timed how long it took to get through the drive thru. 22 minutes. I've tried going at all different times but I always get the same result. I once waited FOURTY FIVE MINUTES just for them to not give me my drink and give me regular fries instead of curly fries.

<Text>I got the Double patty Sourdough combo and it was AWESOME! The sourdough had a nice light crisp on the surface, the meat was perfect and the onions and cheese were great! I loved it so much I ate 3 in two days. I don't recommend doing that as it set me back on my diet a lot but every bite was worth it!

Michael the night manager is very good at his job. He makes sure everything goes as smooth as possible. He has made my food perfectly everytime. Is very accommodating because of my allergies. Thank You Jack in The Box for hiring such a good man there needs to be more people like him in the fast food industry.< /Text>

<Review>Very disappointed. Lobby was closed so had to go through drive-thru, no problem.  One car ahead of me, one behind so not busy. Paid for my food a waited. And waited. After 10 minutes girl came to the window and apologized for the delay and asked if I would pull around to the front and she'd bring out my order just as soon as it was finished.  I agreed, thinking they were making fresh batches 14 minutes waiting and she brought my order out and I was on my way. Got home and unpacked the bag to find the burger patties were old and dry, burger was swimming in mustard to the point that you couldn't hold the burger without getting mustard all over and the fries were old, dried out and cold and way oversalted. Total waste of my time and money. They did get the chocolate shake right but I won't be going by there again in the near future< /Review>< pictures>

<text>Do not come here expecting food that is fast, or food that is food even. The best part of my 45 minute ride the the drive thru of dissatisfaction was getting to the window to see a group of dim witted employees giggling at the counter while customers waited nearly an hour for a  order of 15 chicken nuggets and 2 to tacos.

Simply put, just don't.<//text>< date>

<review>Everytime I have gone to eat here at this particular jack in the box ive had extremely poor, rude, slow, and disrespectful service...the employees have absolutely no respect for thier guests whatsoever! They all need to be let go and the manager that was doing the hiring should be offered a retraining class or let go also!</review>< gmap_id>

<review>They have drive thru only at this time due to the pandemic, which is fine but they are very slow getting orders out thru the drive thru. Had to wait 10 minutes just to get up to the speaker to give my order. Then when I got the order the onion rings where so over cooked that they snapped and the onion itself was completely dried out. I usually enjoy their onion rings but those weren't even edible.</review><user>109052782528335843067<//user>< Date>

<review>They got everything right, were a little slow, but were very clean, wore masks, and had a plexiglass divider. Their nuggets are not good, like ever, but the southwest cheeseburger was pretty good. The loaded mini tacos are the exact right kind of indulgent and disgusting.

They mess up my order almost every time I go through the drive-thru. It's now to the point that I have to check to make sure everything's correct before I drive away from the window<//Review>

<Rating>1</Rating><Review>Extremely slow service, very rude employees- They got my order wrong and tried to blame it on me. When I told them they had the wrong item on the receipt she asked me if I had told the menu number of the sandwich to her coworker. I told her that I said the name of the sandwich and it was repeated back to me.  We were told to pull over and they would have our food right out. We waited over 15 minutes for them to bring out only the sandwich they corrected,  not the other 3 meals. We had already paid and were hungry so we had to wait even longer for them to bring us the rest of our food! Yikes!<//Review><pics>None</pics><resp>{'time': 1593785537044, 'text': 'This is definitely not the impression we want to leave, Jacki. We will look into these concerns.

Driving a semi truck as an essential worker walked over to Jack in the box to get some breakfast and they wouldn't serve us because we couldn't go through the drive-thru. They could have just easily walked out and taken our order but instead they let us walk away. Jack in the box not just this one doesn't seem to want to help people out during the Covid 19. This is not my first problem with Jack in the box but it will certainly be my last. Thankfully the guys at AMPM next door were amazing. what a disgrace Jack in the box. I see why you only have two and a half stars. When I worked in fast food I would have never let a customer walk away. I would have figured out a way to help them out.<//review>

<Text>I eat here pretty often because its not only close to my home but the food is great and the customer service is really good also. The drive through gets a little long at times but its worth it for good food. I order the loaded breakfast sandwhich with mayo almost everytime now. Its become my favorite on the menu. Everyone should try it if u love breakfast foods. I would recommend eating here.< /Text>< pics>

<Text>Just went through the drive thru. I didn't get my full order and my sourdough jack was cold. I called to fix this mistake and they told me I could get the rest of my order next time and even after asking them to make up for the extra gas and time I have to spend to get what I already paid for they refused. Complete disappointed and upset that I'm not being treated right, yet they had no problem taking $25 from me. Not to mention the fact that I'm taking extra risk cause of the covid-19 and now I have to do it again. Jack in the box is not supportive of people or anyone dealing with this deadly virus.< /Text><Resp>{'time': 1588347674299, 'text': "Thanks for letting us know about this, Danial.

Service was absolutely painfully slow. Cashier kept walking away from register. Not enough staff for lunch rush. Also cashier was constantly holding her breast then touching food. It took 25 minutes to order and 15 to get our food. Ridiculous.</Text>

Good food for fast food. As a family of 5 we can never get out of there for under $40. On the slow side too, but always have nice people working. It's super annoying, but make sure you have your ID if you order more than $25 using a card in drive through!</review>

This particular location is very hit and miss. A lot of times the burgers are way over cooked or old. I've eaten here several times because it's close to where I work but it is definitely not my first choice. I love Jack in the box just not this one. On a good note I did have a great spicy chicken sandwich there last week.< /Text>

<Review>This place put 5 nail clippings in my nacho taco and they didn't give my money back when I brought them the taco with all the nail clippings that I pulled out of my mouth from a bite. This place is trash because of this. And by no means is this a false story I have pictures to prove this absolute messed situation.
I will never eat at a jack in the box for the end of time. Because this ruined me buying the cheapest tacos ever</Review><Gmap_id>0x54d2ec7b9ba20973:0x2e5bbe106966f9f6< /Gmap_id><username>Jacob Camacho<//username>< userid>

I had ordered a meatlovers burrito and a shake.( yeah I know weird combo) I ordered said burrito with NO egg, which I would assume the burrito would then have meat, cheese and potatoes inside. NOPE what I got was a flour tortilla with 3 pieces of meat, that was it! Where the hell did the potatoes and cheese go... Not in my burrito, I can say that.

The service was very poor this is the second time I watch them play with their face so their jewellery and then handle my food with bare hands so I denied the food and ask for new food the manager was apologetic and sorry for it and gave me fresh food she was actually quite upset that the employees were doing it. But somebody needs to Monitor and better and somebody was mixing and making drinks up on the front counter where the public had access to it</Review>

Personally I love this place, me and my family come here all the time the service is great, and they are usually really fast.Jack in the box is the place to go for a quick bite either am or pm.From  my understanding,they are open pretty late.< /review>

Just what you would expect from a Jack and the Box. Not the best food in the world but it's what I crave sometimes, especially the tacos. I got three tacos and some onion rings. The service was very fast and efficient. Nothing more to want from a fast food restaurant.</text>

Most terrible experience I've EVER had at a Jack in the box!! I've been all around the country and I've never been so disgusted with they're food. They gave me cold food, burnt fries (they were black) I can't believe I was served this disgusting food. They had me park in front for they're sake of the timer not going off for they're benefit. They didn't give me any ketchup or hot sauce or even napkins! Plus the work place was a disaster! I had to walk in to get my food because it took 15+ mins!<//review>

< Review>
Ive ordered 3 burgers from here on 3 occasions. All of them were terrible.
The first- patty was BURNT
Second - patty was COLD
Third - The cheese was STALE
Steer clear if you want fast food go to Carl's Jr. Their burgers are comparatively priced, but much higher quality and service.</Review>

<review>Long wait in lobby. Not just the first time, but every time to date.  Drive thru is faster.  Always short handed and inside facility is always in disarray. Always food on the floor. I even witnessed an employee scrape food off the bottom of their shoe. 🍟< /review>< name>

My child and I ate here for the 1st time in years, it was the most disgusting tasting food ever!!! I don't even think they use real meat, it just reminded me why I ALWAYS cook at home! Simply Foul!</Review>

I went here and ordered an extreme sausage the old over weight Lady at the window was very rude I ordered one thing she somehow messed up my order didn’t give me any napkins she lied to me about who the manager was she was dirty and wasent wearing gloves while handling my food this was by far the worst experience yet and every time I go there when that lady works it’s the same thing there is a couple nice people that work there but she is not one them she needs to be fired  immediately if not sooner and when I call they don’t answer the phone and when they do that same lady hangs up on me cause she’s scared of losing her job I’m sick of their customer service and how unsanitary they are I will be complaining to the corporate office this woman needs to be fired when she opens the window I shouldn’t be able to smell her b.o. and see her dirty hands without gloves I’m so disgusted< /text>

Its a middle of the road jack in the box,  it has problems with bums so they have to lock the bathrooms, and have signs saying "30 minutes max in the dining rooms" but the service is decent. I usually use the drive thru.</text>
