This a hidden treasure if you have a pet in immediate need of help.  First visit rate was the best of the five I called this morning and even without pet insurance they were reasonable.  I received an immediate appointment and the service is great.< /review>

I took my African Grey for boarding. I have used them before in the past and never had an issue. She was staying at the Torrance location, because they had construction going on at the Carson location.

When I pulled up they were bringing  her in. Once they brought her to me I checked her bowls and they were filthy dirty! I was so upset. I left instructions to clean her bowels two or three times a day. There was bird fences on her food.

The water bowl was full of residue.  There is no way they had cleaned her bowls as I instructed. One of her foot toys was on the cage floor covered in feces.

I spoke to the manager named Natly.  She had a very nonchalant attitude  and was not apologetic. She glanced at the bowls and said I will speak to the staff. I asked who was her supervisor and she said the doctors.  I asked to speak with one of them. She said they would be in at 3:00pm. There was a man standing in the back with sunglasses on watching, but didn't say anything.

When I got home I looked them up online to see who where the doctor's.  The docotor was there the entire time!  He didn't say a word. They have several locations Carson, Torrance and Montery Park.  Dr. Nesha was at the Montery Park location that day. I spoke with her and expressed how upset I was. She claims that her staff washed her bowls twice a day and that Nataly was a very good manager.  I let her know I didnt appreciate that her partner was there and didn't step up when I asked to speak with Nataly's supervisor. She made an excuses for why he didn't didn't step in.

I told her there is no way the bowls were cleaned as filthy as they were. She gave a dry apology and asked what would I like her to do. I asked for a blood test to make sure she didn't have any type of Infection and not be charged. She said oh I can't do that! I was so angry I just hung up.< /text>

<text>Took my dog to get blood work cause he was going to neutered,he is up to date on all vaccinations and they told me that he needed more vaccinations and at least 3 to 4 more vaccinations cause he is a puppy before they would do the surgery, never heard of a dog getting vaccinated
every 4 months this is not good and could give the dog severe health issues in the long run called a few other vets in area and they pretty much said dog does not need and more vaccinations will take my dog and business somewhere else</text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

<review>I know the time is bad with covid-19 and all but I needed to put my fur baby down. They wanted $670 something with ashes and can't go in u have to say your good byes in your car. I felt very upset and just for cremation it was like $165.00 no ashes and can't be with them at the end. I found a place in Torrance $274.00 with ashes and me sake and let us in to be with her till her last breath. Very compassionate I will not go back here.< /review><Gmap_id>0x80dd3505eb95a667:0xfc679536ff5b68cc< /Gmap_id><rate>1<//rate><user>103746982634797283163</user>< Pictures>

Horrible place. A few years ago our cat was injured, unfortunately injuries required he be put to sleep. This place charged us an additional $100 to allow us to be present in the room to say goodbye to our pet. Fast forward to 2019 when our dog was sick, this place gave our dog a dosage that almost killed him! Stay away!<//text>

Good for small stuff, but don't board your pets there. The good thing is that they are reasonably convenient and pretty accommodating with the schedule. I get my dogs' nails trimmed and  get their vaccinations done there. The rest: You have to pay their office visit fee every time you go there, even if your pet is a regular, and even if it is a repeat procedure (my dog goes for allergy shots.) As another person wrote, their prices are pretty high for more involved procedures. But boarding is a no-no. Most vet clinics offer boarding but are not good at it. I think it's because they look at pets as patients and not as companions like real boarding facilities do. Your pet is kept in a caged 3x6-foot (approx. area) kennel with a cold concrete floor. They offer no bedding, toys, music or company. It's just a big storage room for pets. No one spends time with your pet other than to walk them occasionally. Frankly, it's like jail. Spend the extra money and take your pet to a dedicated boarding facility.<//review>

The place is definitely affordable compared to other doctors and I have been however the doctor and the nurses just seem to not have as much care and tenacity for the pets  you can tell they were dealing with a lot of clients and they just all seeing overwhelmed every time I'm there they seem overwhelmed so the other hospital I went to made me feel like they genuinely care and they saw my pet as my family and there was just so much love in the air that I did it feel here</review>

Extremely unhappy with the service. Last year, I brought my dog here for a severe ear infection that caused her so much pain that made her whimper. They informed us that they wouldnt be able to see her, and that their next availability would be 2 weeks. Explained the severity, but they didn't even care. They didn't even offer for me to wait to see if there were any availability or to place my dog on a waitlist. They strictly dismissed us. This was when I took my dog to another vet where they offered me the option to wait due to how busy they were, but still have my dog be seen. They offered better service which made the wait time worth it; this is how a vet should respond to an urgent matter.
Avalon Animal Hospital is just a joke and poor excuse of a facility. If you truly care for the well-being of your pet, than avoid this place at all cost.<//text>

Do not bring your pet here. They only care about the money. The vet didn't even touch my cat. He must of been in the room for 2 minutes.   Horrible experience. When I was in the room, the vet and the vet assistant didn't even close the door to secure my cat. Never coming back.</Review>

Worst experience at an animal hospital. All they care about is money. They will even charge you to watch you euthanize a pet. This raises a red flag for me. Are they humanely putting down pets or are they not? All the staff including the vets are ignorant and don't know what they are doing unless it's time to charge you.<//text>

These people only care about money and not saving your pets. They claim to be a bird clinic yet they can't even handle a parakeet. Find a better place than these people who will just look to get money from you.</Text>

<name>Juan Rodriguez<//name><resp>{'time': 1558373588771, 'text': "Good morning Juan, Sorry for the late reply. You came into the shop seeking a smog after a fail a different location. We recommended you to go back to the same location which you declined, so we offered to do the smog for an extra $20 of the base price ($60 for 1999 and below). None of this should be new info as I explained it beforehand. About the advice; your car failed for no voltage to the OBD 2 port and Emissions from the tailpipe, we cannot offer a diagnosis (advice) due to state laws as we are not a Test & Repair facility. You came back 2 months later seeking a retest for which we charge the full amount if you're past the 30 days. Again, info that I explained and is in print on the receipt you are holding.\n\nBest Regards, DTLA Smog Check"}</resp>< Review>
DO NOT GET A SMOG HERE. They charge more than their posted prices. Especially if another smog place failed you for whatever the reason. Even if it's something small and fixable, they'll fail you instead of giving you some advice and prior to "going under". I HIGHLY RECOMMEND AA SMOG ON SAN PEDRO AND 24TH STREET. They're cheaper and will work with you instead of just collecting money. Went back to get a retest done within the 30 days and technician wanted to charge me another $60!! Out of his mind.</Review>

Dropped in for a smog check with no prior notice, Dario helped me out and he was professional, friendly and quick. In and out in less than 10 minutes. Probably the best place to get a smog check done in DTLA.<//Text>

Super friendly and helpful service too. Dario even noticed my out-of-state plates and recommended a place where I could get my vehicle registered fast.

Scammers. DO NOT GET ANY WORK DONE AT THIS LOCATION.  YOU'LL REGRET IT.  Lies lies lies to your reply. No retest done and you explained nothing. We asked an employee HE  DID NOT EXPLAIN ANYTHING.  TOO BUSY EATING AND PLAYING WITH A LITTLE BOY AND HIS  REMOTE CONTROL CAR. RATHER THAN HELP  OR EXPLAIN ANYTHING TO YOUR CUSTOMERS. BESIDES IT WAS ONLY THE GAS CAP WAS LOOSE. GET YOUR EXPLANATION TOGETHER. STILL SCAMMER LOCATION MEANS NOTHING. Trust DO NOT GO. YOU'LL REGRET IT.</Text>

Your vehicle failed the smog two months ago, and you came for a retest well past your 30 day grace period.  This required you to pay for the smog in full. I explained all of the info to you on your first visit and provided it to you in print on your receipt.  Apologies for the confusion.  Have a good night, and happy holidays!\n\nBest regards,\n\nDTLA Smog Check.'}<//response>

AVOID THIS PLACE. It is a SCAM!!! Incompetent inspectors. I should have known it was a scam when they have it posted like every normal business that they accept visa etc. However, after inspection they notify you it is CASH ONLY. They purposefully fail your test to have you come back, pay more money. I tell them it’s not ok, they acted as if they gave me a refund but after I drive away they kept $20. The younger inspector is a thug. The older women can’t be trusted either. DO NOT GO HERE! I ended up having to contact the CA STATE and have red flagged this Smog Check Station. After they purposely don’t pass
your smog no other smog location will test your vehicle, you will end up having to go through a BAR Referee. In there response, they say they offer Visa/Debit for additional fee...hmmmm why would I turn down a processing fee to then walk down the street to the gas station that you said has a ATM / $2.98 service fee? Thieves!<//review>
<pics>None<//pics><Resp>{'time': 1556908108676, 'text': 'Hey Nathan, nice to hear from you again. First and foremost we are not a cash only business, we accept all major credit/debit cards for a extra fee which you declined to pay. We did not "purposefully" fail your Diesel Sprinter on 4/22/2019, your vehicle failed due to the readiness monitors of your computer. Before each smog we explain the fees including letting you know that if you fail you will pay 10 bucks less than the estimate which will be charged on the retest within 30 days. I fail to see how we would make more money that way. When you came back for your retest your vehicles monitors were still not complete, when I informed you of the results you became visibly aggressive and hostile. I politely asked you to move the vehicle because we had other customers which you neglected to do so, i offered to move the vehicle for you which you rudely and angrily said "no". "The older women" also tried to reason with you and offered a refund which you did not let us complete because you were in a rush. Calling us a scam and spreading misinformation hurts and discredits us as a whole so we take these reviews very serious. Also you stated that your car passed smog with the BAR Referee but your car hasn\'t been tested since I last tested it on 4/22/19.\n\nBest Regards, DTLA Smog Check.'}<//Resp>< gmapID>

Seriously probably the friendliest and most helpful gentleman I've ever encountered in the automotive industry. He got the job done quickly and easily, and made me feel informed and welcomed. Any intelligent person would do well to bring there car here. Definitely worth all 5 stars.< /review>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>I called LA Smog Check last minute because we were looking to sell our car and needed a check done quickly before a potential buyer came to see the car. It was $50, and they said that I could come in right away. My husband brought in the car, and we were in and out in 25 minutes flat! They were very accommodating and even though they had other cars, took care of our urgent request. We were able to get to our meeting on time. Very happy with LA Smog Check!< /text>< pictures>

My experience was great.  Drove up for a smog check with one car ahead of me.  Didn't wait long, they provided fast service.  Nice friendly people that I would go back to again for my smog check needs.<//Text>

Liars said it was 50, drove there (45 minutes 1 1/2 round trip la traffic) wanted to charge me 75.

Very very unprofessional and rude.<//Review>

<resp>{'time': 1572375114657, 'text': 'Good morning A, we charge $50 for 2000 and above and $75 for 1999 and below, when you called in and asked for the price you stated the vehicle was a 2008 so I gave you the price for that year. When you came in your car turned out to be a 1998. I informed you of the price ($75), which then you decided to back your car out and while cursing and calling us liars. You left no time for us to talk or come to an understanding. You called back and we offered a $15 dollar discount for the misunderstanding which you declined. We were not in any capacity rude or disrespectful, if you are still in need of a smog and are ever in the area our offer still stands.\n\nBest Regards, DTLA Smog Check.'}</resp>< gmapID>

Dario is AMAZING. He provided me with the best service, and was SO helpful throughout the smog process. I had difficulties with my car, and he continued to work with me on the slow process of figuring out what was going on! My car passed smog, and I will always recommend this place!! It is the best in LA!!< /Text>

If I could give zero stars I would.  I took my car here for a smog check based on all the positive reviews but they must all be fake.  I should have known when I pulled up the place since it looks like a dump. I took my car in and was told my car "wasn't ready" to be tested and I needed to come back later.  I had to pay the guy $40 to tell me that. Then I came back a week later and was told the same thing.  I kept coming back every few weeks and for two months was told the same thing. "Your car isn't ready to be tested"  Then when my car was magically ready to be tested he said his machine wasn't able to test my car!  Then when I came back in the next day for what must have been the 6th time coming in he wanted to charge me again and said the original $40 I paid was no good anymore.  Save yourself the time and energy and go to a legitimate place.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>
{'time': 1471019465214, 'text': 'Hey Keith, we\'re sorry your car failed on 5/31/16 for your computer not being ready (which still constitutes as a fail), but before every smog i always explain if your car fails you will pay for the fail but you have 30 days to bring back for a retest fee of $10. Yes i do agree you came back week after week with only 10 miles driven in between and I checked your monitors for readiness they were not ready until 8/10/16 that\'s well past the 30 days. You signed the invoice which also clearly states everything I\'m telling you. Your vehicles computer has nothing to do with magic it was a matter of simply driving the vehicle which you neglected to do so. We performed your smog check 8/11/16 and only charged you the certificate fee($10) but as we can see you were still disgruntled. Our reviews are honest and true because we pride ourselves on customer service. We\'re also sorry that our part of LA isn\'t as "scenic" as you would like it to be, but we try our best.\n\nBest Regards, LA Smog Check.'}</resp>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><text>Lovely and pleasant experience! My aesthetician was Carmen with some help from Maria (I had multiple services done at once), they were both amazing! Carmen was gentle and very detailed - I've been getting waxed for a long time and this was definitely the most painless and relaxing experience I've ever had.

I have very thick, dark, and coarse hair, and yet even the Brazilian was comfortable and easy! Love the detail and attention to skin health here- they do a cleanse, oil, and powder prior to the wax and a serum after. Thorough sanitation throughout the location as well.< /text>< gmapID>

<text>Healthcare worker here. They deny service because I work at a hospital.  Their website offers specials for Frontline workers but they are just kidding. Believe me, we wear hazmat type suits at work. They are more likely to be exposed by the general public than from the people trained to protect ourselves.< /text>< pictures>

Came to meet a friend and she was getting waxed and they said it was free for the first time so I said why not and got my ears done. Andrea waxed me and it was really quick and painless. First time ever waxing but now I think I'll come back for my nose and maybe other body areas. Good times.<//review>

<Review>Great prices. Especially if u buy the package deal.
They give u five days to return if new growth erupts during that time.

They will rewax ypu at no cost.

The best experience I ever could have asked for.  Right from the initial consultation I knew that I wanted to work with Dr. Delgado and his team.  I had gynecomastia since I was a teenager and have been wanting to get it removed for years.  The surgery itself went extremely smooth and before I knew it I was already in the recovery room getting ready to go home.  The nurses and his team followed up with me several times during my recovery period to answer any questions I had and to make sure I was feeling good and following the correct post surgery protocol.  I am now fully recovered and literally couldn't be happier with the results!  Dr. Delgado did an amazing job removing my gynecomastia and you can't even see any sign of surgery.  I wish I would have gotten this done years ago!  I highly recommend Dr. Delgado and his entire team.< /Text>

Dr. Delgado saved my life. I was experiencing health complications and fatigue due to oversized implants that had been put in by a previous Dr. I had lost all sensitivity in my breasts and my skin was stretched. I was concerned I wouldn't be able to feel again and would always have deflated asymmetrical breasts.  Dr. Delgado and his team took excellent care of me. I felt heard and well informed about my options. I decided on a breast lift. The healing process was as comfortable and swift as can be. Dr. Delgado brought my breasts back to life. After just four weeks, they look and feel amazing, my scars are delicate and minimal. He even put me on a scar regimen to further reduce the appearance of my scars. I felt cared for by him and his team. I never felt judged or pressured. This is a Dr. with high integrity.</Review>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>Hello, I gave DR. Delgado a 5 star because my experience was wonderful. I spoke with several doctors before doing my arm lift procedure. He was the best one for my choice. He explained everything throughly. I was really scared because it was my first time. With his experience and knowledge I knew he was the right one. So I was comfortable do go ahead and get my arm lift done.
The day of the produce went really well. I didn’t know that it had been done. The Anastasia worked very well and didn’t feel a thing. The facility for recovery with the nurses were amazing as well. I was treated with the fullest respect. I was really felt with loving warmth here. After, I did feel a little pain but as to normal nothing overly crazy in pain. Now after 2 months my arms are looking very good and thinner. He did a really good job that I didn’t have any Complications or any damage that can happen. The wonderful part is after he checks on you and see how your progressing. He’s work is amazing with very minimal scarring. Also, I was not concerned with any extra lumps of fat because he really did a great job my arms are even. Thank you DR. Delgado I would highly recommend you to anyone. Finally, I will be doing more Procedures with him this year again.<//text>< UserId.>

You are contemplating plastic surgery, correct?  All the "what if's?" and "how much?" thoughts are flitting through your mind.  If my review can assist you in deciding upon a procedure with a reputable, highly skilled, nay, "artist", then consider Dr. Miguel Delgado's expertise and talent to make you look like the woman you want to be.  Whatever your reasons, for me it was restoring my neck and lower face to what it was when younger, this could be the opportunity you are seeking.  After seeing various local surgeons and assessing their "cookie cutter" suggestions and portfolios, I delayed my decision.  Upon visiting his clinic for an unrelated procedure, I thought why not review his lookbook and was immediately impressed.  So subtle and yet definitely, sags and bags vanished in the "after" pictures without stretching or obvious signs of "having work done."  The results made the individuals look "rested and relaxed."  What was the price of such expertise was my next thought.

Comparing previous surgery done several years ago, as well as current fees, I realized the cost was extremely competitive.  (Third-party financial packages are also offered.)  Another factor was the outstanding surgery team (I have certain health issues which were addressed).

Finally, post-operative care is another concern.  This is not a doctor who removes tubes and stitches and waves good-bye. Rather, several follow-up visits ensured proper healing was taking place.

The end result is, I am absolutely pleased.  My face around my mouth is contoured to a youthful self, my neck and area beneath my chin no longer fall into folds or sagging wrinkles.  Dr. Delgado understood I wanted a smooth, natural lower face and sculpted accordingly.

I hope my personal experience assists you in your search for the "right" plastic surgeon.  A free consult visit is the only way to find out.</review>

My experience with Dr. Delgado and his office team was GREAT. Very professional,  everyone spent plenty of time explaining the process, listening to my requests and answered all of my questions. My surgery was very successful; I am very happy with the results of my procedure . Every step of the process went exactly as I was told. The surgical team was wonderful, great anesthesiologist. Dr. Delgado is an excellent surgeon!</text>

It has been eight weeks since my surgery and I am delighted with the results.  Dr. Delgado is an artist as well as a skilled surgeon.  He gave me exactly what I asked for.  His staff is pleasant and competent.  The whole process from the initial meeting to the final post-surgical visit went smoothly.< /review>

Here's summary of 2017 Delgado Family Pinot tasting by 4 family members:

Starbright garnet color with consistent color from core to rim. The nose has notes of bright red fruits and tart red fruits like red cap berries. At the same time, there is an ever-present aroma of white or ash smoke. The ash and lightly toasted oak remains consistent on the palate. The acid of the wine is lively which helps balance the higher alcohol percentage. Overall, from color to finish, a pretty true-to varietal and appellation pinot noir.

Good value dinner wine: Strongly recommended< /review>

<text>The surgery was seamless . Dr Delgado walked me through the process and was very realistic about what I should expect in terms of healing times, look and procedure in the pre op visits. Post op visits were scheduled and done without any challenges . The surgery itself was done beautifully and expertly as you would expect from a renowned surgeon of his caliber . Very satisfied with Dr Delgados work , I would definitely recommend him . I am currently 5 weeks post op and its looking better everyday as it heals</text>< user_id>

I can’t say enough wonderful things about this office and everyone who works here. I see Ariel for Botox and Juvaderm filler. She is an artist!! Everything looks so natural. Her bedside manner is perfection, she truly takes her time, does not force anything on you, and her techniques are practically painless. She will answer any questions or apprehensions with patience and you will be so happy with your results!< /Review>

Dr. Delgado’s team was awesome from beginning to end. They respond promptly to emails. The receptionist and other girls in the office were always so sweet and helpful. Dr. Delgado was great to work with and I couldn’t be happier with my results. Cosmetic surgery is not something most people just know they want to do, but I felt like I was confident in him and his office from the first consultation.<//text>

<text>Dr. Delgado and his staff are professional, friendly, and really just made my experience so pleasant. After spending many years hating my breast shape and size, Dr. Delgado recommended a lift and augmentation. He provides his expertise objectively so that his patients receive the very best treatment and achieve the very best results. I am 3 weeks post op and very pleased with the results already! This was truly one of the best decisions I have made, and I'm so happy that I chose to move forward with Dr. Delgado and his team.</text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>{'time': 1602613684484, 'text': 'Thank you so much!'}< /Response>< GmapID>

Had a great experience with Dr. Delgado.
Highly recommended.

Both his staff and chosen nurses made the experience very easy, efficient, and comfortable. Pretty good music choices too ;)

Wanted to give an additional shout out to Dr. Riddle, the anesthesiologist, who was very charismatic, knowledgeable, and courteous. Immediately felt I was in good hands going under (which I haven’t had a lot of experience with before)

For gyno surgery I experienced very little to no pain, was able to stop pain killers about 2-3 days in with 0 issues and was only taking them as advised before, not due to actual pain occurrence.

The recovery went very quickly - Im actually still technically in it now (4 weeks post surgery)  but the results are already pretty clear and visibly no bruising swelling at all remain. Objectively looking - there are practically no signs of surgery having ever occurred (which is incredible in such a short amount of time and still being “in recovery”) - I’ve gotten paper cuts that last longer and are more visible than signs of this operation (in terms of scarring / bruising etc) Adding on to this, although I took the next day following surgery off as a precaution, I easily could have worked from home that day and been totally fine.

Communication is quick and easy where needed.

Overall 5 stars - better and easier than I had even hoped for.

Big thanks from me to them</review>

Dr. Delgado and staff were exceptional! I personally toiled over having my procedure for years and finally mustered up the courage to contact Dr. Delgado's office. Right away I was welcomed with warm, receptive interaction and my angst was put at ease. Every step of the way the women in his office were very informative and always happy to answer my million questions; not to mention their thoroughness in regards to COVID protocols when I visited the office.

I'm a month post-op and I couldn't be happier. For the first time in a long time I'm not afraid of being in front of the camera.

Thank you, Dr. Delgado, for helping me find my confidence again!</text>

I would like to say that my experience with Dr Delgado and the entire staff was excellent!

I found the entire staff to be friendly, helpful and knowledgeable throughout all of my visits, both pre op and post op. I also have to mention that COVID began during my pre consultation/pre op visits, and I was impressed with the precautions that were put into place there.

After meeting with Dr Delgado, I felt very comfortable moving forward with my surgery. I felt he listened to what my ideas and thoughts were for my breast augmentation outcome, but he also made sure to explain what would work for my body specifically. I really appreciated that.

I am about 9 weeks post op now, and have had absolutely no complications or concerns. I am very happy with how my breast turned out and would definitely recommend Dr Delgado!< /review>

I would completely recommend Dr. Miguel Delgado for any procedure you are looking at having done.  The Doctor just recently did a major reconstructive surgery on my arms, and they look amazing!  The surgery was 5 hours done under anesthesia right at his facility.  The quality of care that I received then and continue to receive is outstanding!   His staff is very warm and welcoming, kind and caring.  I was going to have my procedure done from a different doctor, but once I went into Dr. Delgado's office I knew that I was in the right place.  Very professional!<//review>

<Review>How do you begin a review with something that is so life altering? First and foremost I am absolutely thrilled with the end result. I had a lower facelift, neck lift and chemical peel in November 2019. Prior to booking my procedure I had been on the RealSelf website for quite some time trolling other people’s experiences. Searching for the courage to take the plunge.

I had the normal doubts such as what will people think. How can I justify spending this type of money all in the name of vanity? But the bottom line was. I did not like the reflection of myself in the mirror.

My suggestion to anybody contemplating this type of surgery, do your homework! I interviewed several people before deciding on Dr Delgado. The deciding factor, for me, was when I walked into Dr Delgado‘s office I felt at home, it was a warm and welcoming experience. Some of the other surgeons that I had visited had staff that look like they were out of Beverly Hills 90210.

I was looking for a natural look. A refreshed look which complemented my true self. If you decide this type of surgery is for you, be prepared to be gentle with yourself. Give yourself 2/3 weeks to just lay low and heal and most importantly, follow your surgeons instructions.< /Review></record>

I can’t say enough nice things about Dr. Delgado. I have had 2 surgeries with him. 12 years apart.
His patients are wonderfully diverse as to age, gender, race and sex.
He is a skilled and experienced surgeon. He is soft-spoken and his manner is caring and personable.
But more than this, he is an artist at what he does. His face lifts are so natural looking that people who I have known for years (but didn’t know about my surgery) commented: “What a nice haircut!”
I am so pleased with the results and they last a good long time. My philosophy is if you are thinking of a face lift, do it as soon as possible-that way you will have more years to enjoy the terrific results.< /Text>

<Review>One year after my surgery with Dr Delgado, I couldn't be happier with the results.   I look like my best self: younger and happier.   Of the many decisions I've made as a adult,  choosing to have my eyes surgically enhanced by Dr. Delgado was one of my best decisions.  Dr. Delgado has been on the list of the top 10 cosmetic surgeons in the great state of California all the way up to recently, 2018,  and I'm lucky to be one of the recipients of his skillful, artistic hands.  He's also a very real and caring human being.   Three whole experience with getting my surgery done was absolutely delightful a CD stress free from start to finish.   If you are contemplating cosmetic surgery,  look no further.  Pick up the phone and call Dr. Delgado's office for a consultation.   I don't have enough words to tell you how pleased I am with what he's done for me,  and how readily I would recommend Dr Delgado to anyone who is thinking of cosmetic surgery.<//Review>< pics>

BOTOX ONLY REVIEW : I waited two weeks to give the readers a through review. I googled plastic surgery in Novato and this place came up. I booked with Nurse Ariel. The waiting room was professional but cute with free  coffee and Dove chocolates. The procedure room was professional with a big window. Ariel was nice and did a lot more drawing and talking than most injectors. I appreciated that. I wanted a flat forehead and I got it. Before my eyebrow tail muscles were way to strong and way to arched. But now my brows have a softer shape. I feel like botox gives me more time to look youthful and stop the forehead creases before they are etched into my face forever. Do I look a tiny bit different than 2 weeks ago ? Yes, I look smoother. Also when I see other people with botox in their forehead it looks shiny right in the center, but Ariel's injections didn't do me like that. So thank God for that and two thumbs up.</review>

< Review>
I spent most of my teens and early twenties (I'm 25 now) hiding. Not like under a bed or in a trashcan in a park, but just... hiding, trying to make myself invisible. All those baggy shirts, all the time I spent slouching, all those hugs I rejected because I felt incredibly self-conscious... it was to hide my gynecomastia. I tried so hard to get rid of it through exercise. I became a trail runner, regularly running 5-7 miles, and I performed hundreds of push ups every week. Even though my health is probably really good because of it, my gyno only became more prominent. For every extra mile, for every bench press or pushup, I became a little bit more frustrated. At the end of the day, gynecomastia precluded a normal life for me. So I did what I didn't think I would ever do - gynecomastia surgery. I vetted a couple of doctors, but Dr. Delgado gave me comfort in knowing that I was in experienced hands. It has been about 4 weeks since my surgery, and I can say without a doubt a new chapter has been started. There aren't words to express the myriad of positive emotions that I am feeling, but maybe this little experience might illustrate it, especially for those of you who can relate. I have a Hollister shirt that was gifted to me a couple of years ago. I have never worn it in public, because well, Hollister shirts stick to every nook, cranny, and moob. Once my swelling subsided and I could take off the vest for a minute, I decided to try it out. When I saw myself in the mirror, I began to smile and laugh uncontrollably!!! I think I got a little teary eyed too! I lived trying to hide for most of my life, but when I saw myself in that mirror, I realized that I wouldn't have to anymore. Dr. Delgado, I am sure you get this quite often, but thank you so very much, you really have changed my life.<//Review>

I had a wonderful experience with Dr. Delgado's aesthetic nurse Ariel Kirk. I had always preferred surgery over injectables but I was impressed with the results. There are definitely advantages since there is minimal planning and down time and many of the injectables are lasting longer. I had filler placed in my cheeks, around my mouth and eyes. The results were fabulous. My cheeks were fuller, lifting the focus on my face with a more youthful appearance and reviving areas of lost fat. With addition of filler around my mouth, many wrinkles diminished or disappeared and added fullness to my ageing face. The procedures are quick and done in an office appointment. There was minimal discomfort on injection, Ariel uses local and is gentle. The sting on injection is much less than my dental procedures and results immediate. My biggest problem was swelling, definitely ice is the best for that. Some people have more brusing than others but that fades quickly and Arnica helps. Simple, easy, and fast results. I was excited having it done and I'm euphoric with the results. Thank you, Ariel.</Text>

I wish I could give 10 stars.   Dr Delgado and his staff gave me such incredible care from beginning to end.  Dr Delgado answered all my questions in the pre-op visit and gave me a realistic view of what my recovery would be.  He has a great bedside manner and his professionalism and experience put me at ease.
I want to thank all the staff in the office as well.  Every single person I met treated me with compassion and made me feel cared for.   I was a bit nervous and it made all the difference to be surrounded by such kind individuals.    I was greeted when I came into the office by Liz and Shannon.  They were both so warm and friendly.  I have to say that it is rare to see a plastic surgeon’s office with such friendly, real people.  Stephanie was my surgery nurse and she was so very sweet to me.  She has a very mothering nature; which really is so nice when you are going in for surgery.  Dr Riddle was my amazing anesthesiologist.  He talked me through everything and placed my IV.  It was the best IV I’ve ever had, we were chatting away and before I knew it.. all done!!  Last but not least, Mo was my wonderful recovery nurse.  She made sure I was comfortable and able to rest.   I felt so cared for.  I can not say thank you enough to all of you!! I am so very happy with my results.  Thank you for making the process as painless as possible.< /review>

Do you need to turn the clock back in time to look beautiful and feel healthy?  Dr. Delgado is the right person for that chance in your life.  As a professional and years of experience  is the answer to look pretty again.  In 2015 he helped me to get rid of my unwanted weight around my belly.  In 2019 he helped me to look more feminine.   My arms, legs and neck were not looking good.  I need it to feel delicate and feminine like I was in my 20’s.  At 53, I feel great, healthy and pretty again.  Sometimes, we need extra help from a surgeon to fix things that diet and exercises won’t fix quickly.  Of course maintenance of my weight is improving.  I think twice when it comes about fixing my meals.  Water, salads, fruits, sleeping time,  taking care of  stress better.  Positive feelings, compassion toward my self and others.  All of these is part of being and feeling healthy.  Good thoughts towards others is important.  I do recommend Dr Delgado and his entire Staff. They are very professional, and good at what they do every day.  The follow up before and after surgery is amazing.  I love his practice! Thank You Dr. Delgado and his Team!< /review>

Dr Delgado is an amazing physician. He always treated me respectfully and with great care. I couldn't be more pleased with the outcome.

His staff is responsive and friendly. The only misstep was a miscommunication around the start time of my surgery, which was less than ideal, but in the grand scheme of things not a big deal.

Highly recommend.< /Review>

I'm very pleased after my surgery - I no longer have a turkey neck and sags around my eyes.  The staff at the office and the people assisting with the surgery are also great. I don't mind looking my age (65) but just wanted to fix some of things that had really bothered me for years.  My vision was  obstructed do to all the loose skin and one of the first things I noticed was that I can see ceilings and sky again.  If I ever need another procedure, I will definitely  go back to  Dr. Delgado and his staff.  Thanks -<//review><pics>None</pics>< response>

<review>- Knowledgeable surgeon and staff. Very Professional.
- The whole process on surgery day was smooth and I was well informed beforehand.
- Office and rooms are always clean. The entire building that the Novato office is located in (also where the surgery takes place) is pretty much spotless.
- Never felt rushed during appointments, pre and post operation
- Always able to get in touch with someone when I had questions or concerns.
- SF office is accessible by BART

Overall, I feel I made the right choice. It may seem a little pricey in comparison to others but Dr.Delgado and his staff have been doing this for a while and expertise comes at a cost. Something I have no issue paying for when it comes to surgery.< /review>< user>

<rating>5</rating><review>Love love love this amazing office and the incredible people who work here. Evita is the awesome office manager- ask for her she's got the answers to everything and will put your mind to rest if you are feeling scared before surgery. I called her the day before my surgery in tears from fear... by the time we got off the phone I was laughing and smiling ear to ear!!! Love her so much for that. Shannon at the front desk is kind and helpful too. She has the sweetest and most welcoming smile, always making me feel comfortable and right at home the moment I walk through the door. April was the nurse who was there by side before/after and through the whole surgery. She had the warmest motherly nurturing feeling about her which was crucial due to how scared I was going in.

Last, but certainly not least, Dr. Delgado. The god of all things Plastic Surgery. He is the most skilled in his field that I've ever seen, not only based on his credentials but also in person, he has an authenticity and compassion which is so rare in this industry- he was so patient with me, answering all my many neurotic questions and easing my anxiety over the procedure. I told him exactly what I wanted and he made my dreams reality. Sometimes when I look in the mirror now, I literally tear up from how happy I am with the results of my breast augmentation. I went through the nipple and cant even see the scars, its only been 7 weeks. My breasts are perfect in every way :) I had a few consultations elsewhere, but did not see anything near this level of precision and high quality in the service and effects of the procedures. Just check out his website, jaw dropping before and after photos. It's the platinum standard with Dr. Delgado!!! If you are undecided where to have your surgery, look no further. I highly recommend Dr. Delgado and his staff to anyone considering making a better version of themselves. I will never go elsewhere, he is my surgeon for life. With love & hearts sincerely Julian.<//review>< pics>

I have seen numerous surgeries completed by Dr. Delgado with outstanding results and know where to go when I am ready for a procedure.</Review>

I had a wonderful experience with Dr. Miguel Delgado and his staff.  The skin on my stomach had severe stretch marks, very loose, and there was excess skin around my entire waist – basically I had a “muffin topper” that no amount of exercise would get rid of.   On March 21, 2013 I underwent a full tummy, waist enhancement, and liposuction of the flanks.   I have to say my experience far exceeded my expectations!  On our first visit we discussed my challenging medical history – diabetes, high blood pressure and asthma, and determined the next steps to ensure a safe surgery.  During my pre-op appointment we went through how to prepare for surgery, what to expect during the surgery, and possible complications.  I was very happy that Dr. Delgado had me prepare by starting a “Clinical Support Program” that includes vitamin supplements & homeopathic remedies, and he encouraged colon hydrotherapy.   My surgery was a success!!  I felt supported during the entire process.  Dr. Delgado called once a day for a few days to see how I was doing, and I went in once a week for a few weeks for check ups.  He was very response and attentive to my questions and concerns.  For example I called once because my belly button was leaking and he responded quickly wanted to see me right away.  Fortunately everything was fine and he checked in frequently to ensure the healing process was going well. Though the surgery itself was a physically uncomfortable healing process, it was made easier with the support of Dr. Delgado.  In addition, I was quite surprised by my quick recovery and I know that it is due to the Dr. Delgado and his staff!!   It’s been 5 months and I am EXTREMELY happy with my results!!  I am 41 and I am excited to start the next chapter of my life   It’s never to late to feel healthy and beautiful!</review>

I am very pleased with my Botox procedure couple of weeks ago. Lorie, one of the nurses at Dr. Delgado's office, injected my forehead for the first time and it was a very enjoyable experience with great results. I felt very easy and comfortable talking to her about what I wanted. Lorie is highly skilled and makes great suggestions. My Botox results are fantastic! Also, Lorie suggested a skin regimen for my skin type using Skin Medica line, which I am very excited about. I will definitely be back!< /Text>

These guys are great at what they do. Dr Delgado asks all of the right questions and knew exactly what I wanted. Better yet, the results were outstanding. I flew all the way out from Virginia to make this happen, and I'm so glad that I did! Delgado has the best reviews in the country, and there is a reason for that. From consultation to pre-op, to surgery and post recovery, Delgado & staff walked me through every step of the process. As a bonus, the guy has got connections. I was nervous coming by myself from out of town(way out of town) but he literally layed out the whole trip for me. Bus passes, hotel, shuttles, post-op care giver, the works. Plus I got to see a bit of Novato & San Francisco while I was there. It was a great experience. Five stars well earned goes to Dr Delgado, his friendly staff, and the expertise of the practice as a whole. The outcome has fully increased my confidence in an area that I was beginning to think would be a life-long problem. Put the past behind you, get the results you really want. For those results, I recommend Dr. Miguel Delgado.<//review>

I am beyond satisfied with all of my results! Having Botox for the first time I was naturally a bit nervous. Ariel was amazing, she put my mind at ease, walked me through the whole thing and gave me exactly what I was hoping for. I've had two facials with Ariel and I can't wait for my third! Ghazal is also amazing herself. She really knows her stuff when it comes to Coolsculpting. She made me feel like the only patient in the world, I felt so cared for from beginning to end and then some! My coolsculpting results were like magic, I love it. Thank you to Dr. Delgado and his staff for beautifying me!</text>

<time>1384892148030<//time><Name>R. Green</Name><Review>Let me just start by saying, "I adore Dr. Miguel Delgado."

Okay, so what's my story? Since I was a young lady, I always knew I wanted to have a full figure. I was never going to have it naturally--I wasn't built that way. And after having my son and two surrogacy pregnancies, my breasts had decided to become even thinner, saggier, and smaller (as if that was even possible). When it came time to do the research, Dr. Delgado was top on the list. But unfortunately I was with someone who recommended I use a different doctor. I chose to follow his direction. That was five years ago.

I was never fully satisfied with my first augmentation. There was very little consultation, no recommendation of what type of implants to use, and very little preparation or direction. While the staff was friendly and the doctor was knowledgable, I was left feeling a little in the dark.

Fast forward to today: it was time for a revision. It was time to get the size I really wanted (smaller) and repair my keloid scar on the left nipple. I spoke with the Dr. Delgado's team who recommended I make an appointment for a consultation, which I did. And thank goodness! Dr. Delgado is wonderful. He is kind, sincere, and extremely talented.

What I had was a left breast that sat high due to keloid scarring on the nipple and poor pocket development. The right breast was relatively okay, in my eyes. I wanted smaller breasts, which he agreed would look good on my frame, and he suggested I get high profile as opposed to the medium profile I had originally used. He told me how he would be able to repair the left pocket and help create a more natural look using a matrix. (The scar tissue had left very little skin to work with once it was removed during the revision, so the matrix would make it possible to fix the problem). I felt excited and ready to take this step.

The second consultation before my surgery, Dr. Delgado did a thorough examination of my breasts, frame, and position. He gave me suggestions of the size of implant and style--both of which I followed. He also explained in detail the use of the matrix to correct the scarring and help create a natural look.

What is it like today? Today, I can wear whatever I want with as low a cleavage on a shirt as I want--and feel absolutely comfortable. I no longer look like I'm popping a shelf with fake boobies! They are so soft and have an amazingly natural sag (which I prefer) and I am thrilled with the end result! The recovery was smooth and amazingly easy. (That could be because it was a revision and less of a shock to my body this second time around--but I honestly believe Dr. Delgado has a technique that makes it so easy! I bounced back like I was 25 instead of 40!)

I'm sure this was far more detailed than you cared to read. But I wanted to be sure to show how Dr. Delgado worked miracles with me! His staff is wonderful and Colleen was absolutely fantastic--helping me count when I was too excited to be able to!

I am a new woman because of Dr. Delgado! And for that, I am eternally grateful!< /Review>< pictures>

MOMMY MAKEOVER

Shortly before my 40th birthday, I decided that my post-baby body needed quite a few repairs. I was determined to find the best plastic surgeon in the Bay Area, one that was extremely skilled and would not leave me with that scary, over-pulled “deer in the headlights” appearance.

Dr. Delgado, a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon in Marin, came highly recommended by friends and respected members of my community. He specializes in natural facial and breast surgery, liposuction and tummy tucks –so I made an appointment for a consultation.

He was extremely professional during my appointment and we discussed many different options for me.  He took the time to explain all of the procedures, the recovery process –and realistic expectations of the results.  He provided an unbiased opinion and did not push me into doing anything that I did not want or need.  His consultation was very informative and I felt very comfortable before –and after surgery.

The procedures, which were performed in a private operating room located inside a hospital, were lengthy since I signed up for several procedures at once --but the outcome far exceeded my expectations. I was also comforted knowing that there is an emergency room a short distance away should any issues arise.

My recovery went well, and after the swelling went down and all of the stitches were removed, I was extremely pleased with the results. My face and body had a natural and even appearance that only a skilled doctor can provide –with scars that are barely visible. I love the way I look and feel!  Even 8 years later, I am still asked what my secret is to such a youthful appearance and I simply reply:

Part good genetics… Part good products… Part GREAT doctor!

Today, I maintain his amazing work by taking better care of myself (mind, body and spirit) and with the help of an occasional appointment in their facility –including facials from their amazing esthetician Alise. She is very knowledgeable and I love the unique products that she recommends for my skin care needs.

They deserve a five star rating! Note, I have never written a review for a professional service, but I feel strongly that women, especially mothers, should know who should be on their team if they are contemplating this type of elective surgery or simple maintenance of what you already have.

Thank you to Dr. Delgado and his staff for an amazing experience!</review>

The moment you step foot into Marin Cosmetic Surgery Center, it's instantly apparent Dr. Delgado and his team hold thier patients in high regard and strive to exceed your expectations! I have used the DelgadoMD skin care products for the past 2.5 years and I am absolutley thrilled with my brighter, firmer and smoother skin! The Active Antioxidant vitamin C serum, Hydratng Peptide Gel and Brilliant-C Brightenting cream are my absolute favorites. Latisse also helps to darken and elongate my eyelashes!  I have seen several postoperative resluts of Dr. Delgado's facelift surgeries. His expertiese and talent consistently produce outstanding natural results! Choosing Dr. Delgado means you will be in the hands of a surgeon who geninuinely cares about your satisfaction.<//review>

The pilot was well informed explaining the history of of hot air balloons, the areas we flew by and overall very interactive. Bring a sweater for the ride, does get chilly on the ride. Go to the restroom before your depart cause theres no restrooms out there on the open fields. Take my word.<//Review>< pictures>

Had a great time. "Base camp" is a beautiful winery that you can meander around while waiting to depart to balloon launch site. Extremely skilled pilots that took us up when the other companies wouldn't fly and rescheduled all flights (while I'd understand being rescheduled,  I'd still be a bit twisted after getting up at 4am to get there in time....zzzz. lol) nice time in the air, and nice champagne toast back at the winery. Will be flying with them again!< /Text>

What an amazing experience, the staff were experienced and friendly, it was a memorable hot air balloon ride from start to finish. The first date we booked had to be canceled due to windy weather but they were able to reschedule us right away.  The Vinyard we started our adventure was beautiful and scenic, our pilot Pete was so knowledgeable and friendly. Once the perfect launch site was found the set up of the balloon went quickly and was fun to watch.  The hard working crew helping our pilot were so awesome, very personable, the setting up and breaking down of the balloon is no easy task. If we ever get to fly again, Pete is our Aeronut with A Grape Escape. I can't say enough great things about this whole experience. The champagne toast and certificate at the end  made it really special.  We're so happy we choose this company for our first hot air balloon ride.<//Text>

Rude unprofessional unwelcoming. Called to inquire whether they have senior discounts or any specials this month. Some woman named Erin answered the phone and was rude right away... her tone and her answers were short and irate for no reason. I was kind and professional with my inquiry and ready to book an adventure. I have no idea what caused her to be this way and then hang up on me lol I’m glad I called instead of booking online since that’s the way they treat eager and cheerful customers. I’ll spend my cash elsewhere.< /text>

The only thing I would change is to have a staircase to get into the basket a lot easier. I injured my knee due to this. The flight was a beautiful experience!<//review>

Bill and his crew did a great job. Even when mother nature wasn't giving in with the fog those guys didn't give up to find a spot to launch.
They got us off the ground and made it an amazing day. I will use them again and recommend them to everyone!</Review>

Thank you, Aloft, for the amazing Sunday morning! From start to finish, the experience was smooth and comfortable. Really appreciate the complimentary hand sanitizer and face mask. Cannot wait to have the opportunity to fly with you again.< /Text>

<review>Even though I had to drive 2 hours to get here even after I called at 5am to make sure we were flying and they had said yes.. they ended up canceling once I got there due to weather conditions. The reason I'm giving them 5 stars was because of how friendly they were especially the older guy he was really funny and professional..And also for making sure the weather is safe for us because it is dangerous flying in a bad weather.</review><gmapID>0x80db7e14c8162e97:0x9c3785c5d0cce97d</gmapID><user_id>111973425099565657881</user_id>< Pics>

<review>We were on vacation for just a week and my cousin referred us to them. He highly recommended them. When I called they were fully booked as it was a last minute reservation. They rearranged their schedule to accommodate us! We loved every single moment of it! The ride was so relaxing, as well as nice and smooth. The view was just breathtaking!! Our pilot Rusty, was extremely nice and knowledgeable; he kept us informed throughout the entire flight. Answered everyone’s questions with ease. We even got to see my cousins house from up above! The breakfast and champagne toast at the end was the cherry on top. What a great experience! The crew was fantastic and Rusty (our pilot) was friendly and so funny. He made the entire experience so memorable. Highly recommend!<//review>< user_name>

Had a fantastic baloon ride with friends! Great experience overall and pilot was very knowledgeable and made the experience very seamless. Only thing is that the "continental breakfast" afterwards was packaged snacks in a basket. You will want to go get your own breakfast after.< /text>

<text>Absolutely amazing!!!

Our pilot Pete was extremely knowledgeable and funny. Has a great sense on humor. I must say I love learning about the history or Temecula and the fact he was explaining everything and learning the history as we are in the hot air ballon in such a beautiful scenery was immaculate.

All and all I would definitely come again and experience this beautiful place . Amazing location very beautiful.

The whole entire crew made it so comfortable and enjoyable.

Fun adventure! Beautiful views of Wine Country and the pilots were extremely knowledgeable and kind. Downfall is that you get a small compact spot for 4 adults. Which makes it hard for everyone to enjoy if your with bigger adults.</review>

Being affraid of heights I was concerned about the balloon ride. The staff relieved my concerns rather quickly though. Bill, our pilot, was incredibly friendly and very experienced. He had almost 30 years of balloon flights under his belt, so I felt safe in the his hands. Bill first took the balloon up high, the views were marvelous, then as the flight continued he dropped it low and contoured the vineyards. 10 out of 10 would recommend.<//Review>

Had a most amazing ride with Bill our Capitan.  The staff were so nice and knowledgeable. I plan  on doing this again, and would pick no other then A Grape Escape. A wonderful way to start a day - above it all!
Set back down with not even a sigh. With  breathtaking views then top it off with a champagne toast!

<text>They're quick and awesome. Took my girlfriend for her birthday, took us above the clouds! Crew is professional and fast. We were up in the air faster than the other hot air balloon crews.

Breakfast snacks are definitely a miss. Just wrapped muffins and streudals. Would be nice if they offered warm crossaints from Costco but I'm just being picky. Morning champagne was good too.<//text>< pictures>

<Text>First time on a hot air balloon and loved it. The main operating guys are professional and very nice. The ride was also great. Came here for my birthday and they brought us complimentary cake, which was unexpected surprise. Would recommend this to others as well.<//Text>< Name>

< Review>
Can't say enough good things about this company and our Balloon Ride Experience! Even the office staff who helped me book over the phone were amazing! We arrived at 5:30am to the Fair Grounds for the Temecula Balloon and Wine Festival and signed in, hopped into a truck and were taken to a field to take off. It was AMAZING to watch all of these balloons inflate and all of the hard work that went into it! We had Pete as our pilot and he and his team were phenomenal. He had the answer to every question, and really made the flight exceptional. I HIGHLY suggest a hot air balloon ride with this company! We went as a group of 3, along with the 6 others in the basket and LOVED it!</Review>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>Everything about our expierence was wonderful. The service and staff were BEYOND nice. After arriving we drove a bit around town because the pilot and his staff were checking weather and wind conditions. We did not mind that one bit. The balloon ride itself was super smooth and relaxing, not what I was expecting. The landing was quite bumpy but I personally thought it was super fun. Brace for impact. I don't think anyone is hungry this early in the morning so the simple muffins and Danish are perfect. The champagne they serve after the ride during the intimate celebration is made by Europa winery and it is delicious. The mimosas offered are simple and delicious. I would recommend this company to family and friends and would use them again in the future. I think it is important to comment on the fact that we were not charged until after the ride and had a choice credit card or cash. Even though I made the reservation on my card I was able to pay cash. I think this is really great. The reason they do not charge until after the fact is because due to weather and wind conditions The ride can be canceled and so they avoid a lot of fuss having to refund people. Thanks guys for the wonderful expierence.<//Review>< pictures>

This was the most memorable thing we did on our 21 day tour of California and the western states. Temecula is GORGEOUS and to see the vineyards and orchards with the mountains all around. We thought it might be cold or windy and that couldn't have been further from the truth as the heat from the flame kept us very warm and there is no wind because you move at whatever speed the wind blows. Truly an awesome experience. Jeff was our pilot and he's flown balloons all over the world since he was little and he is extremely skilled and was able to land our basket full of people smoothly on the trailer when the flight was over. We were highly impressed. The breakfast (muffins/snacks, juice, champagne) gathering after the flight is also a really nice touch. I recommend this to everyone.</Review>

We went for our 40th wedding anniversary today. The crew was knowledgeable very friendly. The gave us our monies worth from almost 25 ft off the ground and almost touching the vines to 5,000 in the air where you could see for miles and miles.
We had a lot of fun and would recommend it to everyone.

<Text>-My first experience on a Hot Air Balloon-AM-

For those that are afraid of heights, I can relate. Overall, I was only scared for the first five minutes since its normal to psyche yourself out. When you're getting into the basket and the hot air balloon starts ascending, you will start to think, 'Holy crap, am I really doing this?!!' No Sweat....just take a few breaths and before you know it, you're in the sky enjoying a beautiful morning view. The balloon was steady enough to evaporate my fear.

In the basket, it's segregated into sections. If you have a big balloon, there will be four sections where four people can fit into each section. Our guide had the center section to himself in order to fly the balloon, total of five sections.

Recommended Attire:
Long pants and a light sweater (the heat from the hot air balloon will keep you warm; it's like having a heat lamp right above you).

Do bring a jacket and leave it in the van because you'll need it for the champagne picnic afterwards. Outdoor, back at Vineyard.

Bring sunglasses, unless you want to squint in all your photos!

Shoes: Closed toe that you don't mind getting dirty; the takeoff area is usually in a field with plenty of dirt.

They have various balloon and basket sizes. If you want privacy, it is available. In our group this morning, there was a couple with their own private balloon. After we all landed, we learned that there was a proposal on that private balloon, so romantic! Luckily, the girl said yes and we all celebrated with them at our champagne picnic afterwards. I didn't get a price for the private balloon, but for general admission is $145.

The picnic included some fruits (grape, oranges, and bananas) and wrapped pastries that seemed too sweet to me. Picnic also included champagne or mimosas. We were also handed some discounted wine tasting tickets for the Great Escape and Robert Rezoni, bonus!

Overall, I had a great time. My favorite part of this experience was overseeing the other hot air balloons with the fog rolling back, simply fantastic!< /Text>< Pics>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Excellent ride! Incredible experience, including balloon ride and breakfast afterwards. Ballooning lasts about 1 hour, more than enough time to enjoy it.
Location is in the middle of several wineries, which makes the landscape even more beautiful.

Excelente passeio! Experiência incrível, com direito a passeio de balão e café da manhã depois. Passeio de balão dura cerca de 1 hora, tempo mais que suficiente para aproveitar.
Local fica no meio de várias viniculas, o que torna a paisagem mais bela ainda.< /Text>< Response>

First time,  We're from Indiana and I've had this place on my bucket list! I suggest you take the audio for on Alcatraz,  it's go at your own pace which is terrific so you can get time to check out all the cells!!</Text>

For sure have wear walking shoes! Very nice and a good walk. The jail tour was very nice. This gives you the opportunity to see how Alcatraz was.< /Text>

Our ALCATRAZ Trip was spectacular. The weather was great, it was cool breezy and sunny. The view was AMAZING and everyone on the tour and island were friendly and helpful. GREAT EXPERIENCE!< /Review>

<Rate>4</Rate><text>Apparently when we went, it was their first day back open for a while. Limited availability makes for a safer feeling trip. They now have an app for the audio tour for your phone as well as their supply of tour devices with earphones- I suggest you get those.

It was a long wait to start the timed tour due to social distancing, then when our app didn’t work, we tried to go back to the start to pick up devices- but being as it was the last tour of the day, they had already packed up. Luckily, we were able to grab a device from the drop-off @ the end of the tour, but we were out of time to do the whole thing & just walked through without the audio tour which was a bummer. Rangers will make sure no one is left behind before the last ferry leaves.

The ferry was nice, with lots of space, although not much enforcement of social distancing due to many people. More labeling on the ground and signage might help.

Still, definitely always fun to have a lil history trip in SF. In my opinion, the Native American feature should be a part of the Alcatraz tour and not optional- it’s down a different path to the right when you get there, past the fire engine. Also, maybe there should be some education of solitary confinement’s effects on mental health.

This was a wonderful educational opportunity for our 3 children and great views of the bay. I would recommend this highly for anyone in S.F. for the first time<//Text>

Having grown up partially in the Bay Area, I’d always thought about going but hate crowds. I was stoked to be able to go, even in these weird times. The boats and park were easy to keep socially distant within. Also, the team was super helpful for getting up those hills will hip issues. Unfortunately the inside was closed, but overall everything was amazing!!<//Review>

Efficient service. Wish they had more departure times from the island. No food or beverage service on the ship or island. Plan ahead. We didn't and were rather cranky by the end of the tour.< /Text>

The people that work at the booth and front are very nice and polite. I didn't like that this business(even online) doesn't mention anything about not having access to cell tours or anything inside for that matter, at this moment. If i would've known that, I would have waited to do this when they open up fully. Still was a great experience, I think it's overpriced for the attraction not being fully open.</Review>

<text>As 10-29-2020 the Indoor tour is closed.

If  you are planning to go and think you will have access to the interior of the prission, DO NOT GO!

They should have a sign telling you that the tour is outdoors only and you do not have to pay the $40.00 fee just to go and walk around the island.< /text>< gmapID>

Got here early, because I was told parking was a nightmare. Didn't know that the ground personal, from the ticket agent to the boarding agent were so mean. We had tickets for the 2pm, and didn't allow us to even stand by for the 1pm, unless unless we have missed our boat. Very ridiculous process.</text>

<review>Amazing trip, u have as many time as u need. Book ticket online and even if on the ticket is 2 pm, you can go on the island, earlier than scheduled :) I was there in November so boat was not full at all. I really love what you have done with the plants at Pier 33 - they are goergous @AlcatrazCruisesTeam. 🌷🌼🌸🌿🌱Thank you for such experience!< /review>< date>

< Review>
I needed a new skate board for my son who recently got into skating. The staff was really knowledgeable and helped guide me in the right direction to the correct board.

If you’re a seasoned skater or just getting into it, Street Science can help you out.< /Review>

<text>Staff are extremely kind and helpful. They definitely know their stuff. The places is small but packed with great items. Everything you need to start your skateboard journey or for a continuous skater. Shop seems like a great hang out place as well.

It was a big drive to get there but definitely worth it. Will be a frequent visitor for sure!<//text><user>117451333083822077837</user>< rate>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>Street Science did a killer job of helping me get a old school deck built up.  Because I’m also part of an independently owned business I decided that I was going to seek out a local shop and not go online.  They were able to tell me that my original trucks wouldn’t fit and that I needed some stiffer bushings, and saved me a bunch of time because they knew what they were doing.  I’d be glad to recommend them again!</Review>< pics>

The service was not very well the person working there was rude and the return policy is odd. There was a misunderstanding and ended up wasting 40 dollars on a scooter clamp. Also to use their half pipe they charge 5 dollars and there’s large cracks which makes it very dangerous and not as comfortable. I do not recommend.<//Review><user_name>Matt S<//user_name>< user_id>

<response>{'time': 1588687608087, 'text': 'Hi Matt, we appreciate the feed back. Sorry if your experience wasn’t up to par. Our return policy is if a part does not appear used and we can resell it we exchange for store credit. There are a few seams that need repair on the ramp but we ride it regularly and a few worn surface sheets does not make it dangerous. The few worn sheets will be replaced soon as we are in the middle of a ramp resurfacing . Send me a email shop@street-sci.com explaining what day you came in and what went wrong with the scooter exchange and Il make it right, and I’d be happy to shoot you a ramp pass for when the ramp repairs are complete. 👍'}< /response></record></dataset><record>

The shop is very friendly they help you out picking decks and parts if your a beginner and I recommend going their with your kid that wants to skate but you don’t know anything about it I would even go their just to hang out they have a mini ramp/quarter pipe to skate in the back even during quarantine they have good selection and good service I would go their again< /Review>

I somehow always end up buying something at this shop, the owner is super kind lets you know everything you need to know about the products you're curious about but gives you the space to choose exactly what you want. I have suggested this store to baby skaters and experienced skaters alike, its top notch but affordable.< /text>

My son broke the axle on his scooter doing a trick at the skate park.  The owner of this place helped us buy one that fit.  Thank you!

This is the only scooter shop in the Bay Area that I know of.  They have more scooter stuff than you think.  I added a few photos to see..  Hopefully it helps..</review>

the two high school(?) kids that work here do not care about you as a customer or about skateboarding in general. However, the lady/co-owner  of the shop is super nice and respectful, so....I guess that balances it out?  and they have a ramp.<//Review>

<text>David here,

Over the last decade I have been looking at the skeletal remains of my once proud skateboard, constantly telling myself to fix it up and get back to the sport I once loved so well. So today I did it, went into Street Science for a whole new setup, right off the bat MacKenzie welcomed me in and started guiding my way through the new brands.

I was amazed to find out all of my tried and true brands were dust in the wind, sold out to walmart and suffered huge reduction in quality, but MacKenzie was a big help in finding me the right deck for me (I felt bad because she took down about 15 and had to put them back up). In the end I got a really nice finished product that I look forward to testing on the streets. Still the same prices I grew to expect years ago which was a big plus. Awesome time today and I will be coming back for sure.

P.S. they give half pipe/vert lessons starting at $40 which is great for kids.< /text><gmapID>0x808fe79f994ddb69:0x61278d86c3531e99< /gmapID>< Name>

i'm a skater, 41 years and still rollin' ... i've learned who represents the sport, and carries that to the next level through owning a local skate shop ;)

skating IS local, by definition, yet it also is a lifestyle, so running a small shop as well as Street Science does is a testament to their owner Jeremy Morgan.

i'm honored to have skated with jeremy for well over 10 years, he's a true friend and genuinely nice guy ... it's great to see the shop succeed, every once in a while the world does make everything perfect !< /text>< pictures>

<review>They do a good job. Normally, I book an appointment before going. Most of the time I always wait either way 20-30 min extra. They will try to change the person I requested at times. I just don’t let them because I book for a reason with those people. The job they do is good, and unfortunately they did raise their prices recently.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x808e156b61efbd0f:0x122ef6695167fecf< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>Went there twice. First time to fill up and repair my acrylicsl nail. Was really happy with it.
The second time, I took an appointment the day before, but still had to wait 35min for someone to show up and take care of me and my friend.
Pedicure is feeling really nice.
However, the regular manucure... I paid an extra $5 for a French and the day after most of it is gone just by washing my hands (gently...). I am really annoyed with that! But in general it's a good place.
Just make sure to have cash or venmo on your phone because they don't take card.< /review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP5Gj3vCIVp5dC632GL7h88tuRz-SgR65M0b6_1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< Resp>

I moved here last summer and was in search of a new nail place. I had several recommendations for tracy's and I am so happy I listened to everyone! I have had a different nail tech every time but every single experience has been great! There can be a bit of wait for walk ins but their business is worth it< /Text>

< review>
Great waxing spot! I have yet to get my nails done but both times I went for a full leg and Brazilian were great experiences. Both times different women but timing and technique were awesome. Little pain in waxing and made me feel very comfortable. I always check when I get home and didn't find any stray hairs thankfully. Check in for a discount on waxing services. I've had friends recommend this place for nails and I am looking forward to getting them done here. Thanks Tracy Nails!</review>

<text>I came here for my wedding nails and they went above and beyond. I brought in a picture from Pinterest, and I wasn't sure if they were able to do it. The owner took my nails on and made it happen. They did SNS on my nails to strengthen them and make them longer. Then using gel nail polish she was able to get the color and the glitter I wanted. The nails lasted 3 weeks, and removal was a breeze.
They do a good job every time I have come here! And I'll be coming back for any nail needs.<//text>< Rate>

This was an amazing place. My boyfriend and I went to get a pedicure. We got there about 8 minutes late but they were totally amazing. I got an pedicure and it was amazing. I love the environment! My brother who is a huge basketball fan was cheering with the staff and it was great to be around friendly people. Price was very reasonable. I made another appointment to take my daughter and I will defiantly be a frequent customer!!!</text>

Tracy Nails is a clean, comfortable salon with excellent experienced staffs. I discovered it by mistake but truly a happy one! Super relaxing and tidy, this place is my go-to nail spot. Everyone here is friendly and accommodating to whatever you need for your nails. I absolutely recommend checking them out on a day you'd like to feel pampered and well taken care of!</text>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><Review>I went to Tracy Nails for the first time almost 3 weeks ago to get some acrylic tips for an event I had. They were able to make a same day appointment for me and a friend, and were immediately ready when we walked in. I had never gotten my nails done in Capitola, as I had heard nothing but bad stories no matter where my friends had gone. I decided to try Tracy Nails because none of my friends had been there before, so I had no bad stories in the back of my head.
The guy that did my nails was awesome at explaining what everything was, and was very understanding of the fact that I had a lot of questions (I'm a scientist, I like to understand what's going on around me!). He also really listened to what I wanted (I can't have too long of nails in the lab, but wanted them to look a certain way), and double-checked every step of the way that I was happy.
They came out looking great and I will definitely be going back soon to get them refilled.< /Review><Resp>{'time': 1608044861554, 'text': 'You are very nice. I appreciate your time leaving feedback for our store. See you soon.'}</Resp><rate>5</rate></record>

I showed them a picture of what I wanted my nails to look like and they exceeded my expectations!! The shape and length was perfect and look even better then the original picture!

This place is highly recommended. Love this place! Such a nice place. The place is clean and super modern. Super cute atmosphere and great customer service. The staff were amazingly nice and took great care of me. Everyone is very friendly as well and talented. They are very personable and tentative and always have a smile.  They have a ton of different color options. Plus, their prices are extremely reasonable for how high end the salon feels. Will come back!< /review>

I had a great first experience here this afternoon! I was happy with the cleanliness and outdoor chairs. I got a great basic gel manicure from Dolly, who was very attentive to detail. Didn’t feel rushed to get out. I also appreciated that the person answering the phone earlier in the day told me ahead that they are cash only.<//text>

<Review>I've been coming to the Tracy Nails for a couple of months now. I regularly get my nails done about twice a month. I love everyone that works here. Everyone is super friendly and really knows how to do nails!!l Everyone here is really talented. I also found that the pricing here is very reasonable compared to nail salons in the area. The nail salon is also very cleanly, relax and qiuet. I will keep coming.< /Review>< pictures>

I was pleasantly surprised that the staff speaks English well. It is very clean and very relaxing experience. You don't feel like you're getting herded in and out like cattle. They don't talk about you in Vietnamese while they're working on your nails. I'm definitely going back and the prices are great.<//review>

Came for during a bachorette weekend for my cousin. We made an appointment with another salon not knowing they couldn't accommodate the three of us at the same time. So we headed to another salon which was also booked up for the afternoon. One of the women there recommended Tracy Nails and it was the best recommendation ever! They were able to do all of our manis & pedis right away. Super comfy arm chairs during the pedis. Can't beat that! The women were all amazing - so much fun & entertaining. The price is completely worth the experience and it's one of the best salons I've ever been to.<//text>< userid>

Efficient and great attention to detail for my gel pedicure and manicure. Everyone wore masks and gloves, there was hand sanitizer at the entrance, and I was given a Clorox wipe to open the bathroom door. I would definitely come back.</Text>

I've been coming here for 9 year and never truly never had an amazing experience. They rush their services, rarely do a full cleaning under the nail (finger or toes), and stress and push you for tips (and push for cash).. but this last time.. they ran after me saying I didn't pay.. i told them three times I venmoed Tracy before I left (they dont take cards cause Covid but cash is okay 🤦🏼‍♀️) and made me go back to the front desk to show me Tracys phone saying there is no payment when MY NAME was at the top of her venmo payments.. i didn't appreciate how I was treated especially after giving them generous tips they truly didn't deserve (see picture with edges not fully painted). They officially lost me as a client.</review>

< review>
I am so impressed. I am somebody who is very picky about my Nails and Salons etc.. today was my first visit at Tracy Nails in Capitola. I was very nervous to try somebody new however the salons are not open yet where I live in Campbell. Tracy did my nails. She did the most amazing job and I am absolutely impressed I cannot speak  highly enough about it. I am allergic to powder liquid nails so Tracy molded my coffin shaped nails from Gel. The most beautiful set of nails I think I've ever had. My pedicure was impeccable and I even opted to have my lashes done. You won't find a better price or a better job on your lashes as well. Trust me when I say I am very picky and I cannot believe I left without one complaint and completely impressed. I can't even believe it. Bring your business here. This place is awesome. If you look on to the walls you will see that Tracy Nails has won awards every single year since they've been in business for being the best nail salon in Capitola. Thank you Tracy!❤</review>

Very crowed. I had an appointment and waiting for 45 minutes in the chair with feet in water.   I kept asking when can we get started and they kept saying just. A minute. For 45 minutes - just a minute...  steer clear!< /Text>

Best nail salon ever. My girlfriend and I walked in a few minutes before they closed on and they were still happy to squeeze us in for pedicures. They offer a deluxe pedicure, and a hot stone massage.  The massage chairs for the pedicures were the best I've had, and the staff was very friendly! We will be happy to drive out of the way to come back here regularly.💗< /text>

@@@@@This was my first visit at the ""TRACY NAILS"" and bonus it was also my birthday! I came alone for some exclusive pampering that my husband wanted to treat me with.
I love the boutique feel and although it is a beautifully big place it is rather cozy. I also appreciated the personal tour and the opportunity to order my first ""beermosa"" which was particularly delightful. I ordered the service ""On the Rocks"" and added the yelp complimentary scrub. It felt amazing! My service provider was awesome with the service and small chitchat but I really do appreciate the sweet happy birthday song and candle with chocolate that was offered to me. I'm going again for sure.< /review>

If you are looking for a calm and relaxing place to get your nails done, Tracy Nails  is the spot!  They only do natural nails, so there isn't any noise from the hand drills or the nasty acrylic smell which I appreciate.  All the team members are friendly and welcoming.</Text>

<text>This place is easily one of the best places to get your nails done in this town. I get my hands done with mistress
which I think is the owner and my feet by girl. Everyone does an awesome job. My eyebrows always stay on point because of them as well. Only one girl does the eyebrows but I forgot her name. love love love this place. It's a must.&&&< /text><pics>None</pics><Rating>5< /Rating>< user_name>

<review>I took my 80-year-old grandma here for her first pedicure ever and she had THE BEST experience. The staff were super friendly, helpful, and accommodating - making her feel comfortable. She had so much fun! They are clean, professional, and very well run. Tracy is also an impressive philanthropist and funds families, orphanages, seniors, and people with disabilities in different communities in Vietnam, so supporting this salon definitely goes to a good cause. Highly recommend!< /review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

I can honestly say this is one of the best gel manicures I've ever had! I'm usually disappointed when I get my nails done and I am so excited to finally be happy with what I got. Very fairly priced too.  My favorite part was sitting in front of a window as I was getting my nails done and the view - made the experience even better. Thank you, I will be coming back!<//text>

<review>The quality you get really depends in who you get. These were done by Helen, very happy. Last set was done by Trang and those would have only gotten ⭐⭐/5. The main reason I keep going back is because they can almost always get you sat within 10 or so minutes.< /review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM5HQOwepf5uMsPza6oK7Cni5nnWBzBj6K3kTjt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< UserId.>

<review>Tracy City is my favorite, most relaxing place to be. When I moved to CA it took me a while to find that perfect nail place. Do yourself a favor, skip the struggle and come here straight away. Everyone is so sweet and kind and your nails will always look amazing! I love coming here, I love catching up with everyone, the owner is one of my favorite people of all time, and I'm always so happy with everything when I leave!!< /review><time>1565306754748<//time></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I saw the reviews and was hesitant so I just got a manicure. The service was so great and my nails looked so good I went back for a pedicure. I travel a lot for business and was traveling when I went here. I am disappointed I won't be able to go back. Really great customer service.</Review>< pictures>

Great service! I've been here 3 times now for a mani/pedi and have had a great experience with each. The nail technicians are friendly and talented. They offer a large selection of gel colors and nail polish, relaxing massage and beautiful nail art. They do get busy at times so I recommend calling ahead.</Text>

Absolutely love Tracy Nails. I've never had a negative experience with anyone in their salon, including other customers. Most of the time I know what I want when I go in. When I don't, they give me ideas and help me figure out what I want. I've never been disappointed< /Review>

<review>My wife, daughter and I got manicures and pedicures at Tracy Nails. It was a great experience for me. The salon is huge and so many workers available. We waited just 5 minutes without an appointment. The staff were very friendly comapared to what I've experienced before. The reason for 4 starts because of the smell of the chemicals and also the communication is hard. I asked for gold and got yellow. Go 49ers!< /review>< time>

<Review>These people gave me the BEST pedicure and shellac mani. I went here a few days before my wedding and got a pretty typical bridal set of nails (soft pink).

Let me just tell you- the shellac nails I got here lasted longer than the 50+ shellac manicures I've gotten over my lifetime. Seriously good stuff. My nails didn't chip AT ALL. EVER. Over time, the only way you could tell that my manicure wasn't new was because my nails grew out..so obviously just a natural occurrence.

The people at this salon were SOOO amazing and sweet. I brought a group of six women and they were able to accommodate all of us. We were in and out in 90 minutes and we all left very pleased with our services!!!

I recommend this location if you are ever needing to look for a trustful and 10 star results.< /Review>< Rating>

<review>Not so good. A friend and I had appointments and still waited over half an hour. It was a zoo in there. The language barrier was a problem, I was unable to convey the color I wanted. When I got home I noticed my cuticles were not all done and my feet were very rough, no better than when I walked in. They are cheap, but I will not be back.</review>< Rating>

They get really close to the cuticle and sides of the nail bed. The really good people even put a layer of polish on the tip of your nails before doing a second coat of polish on the entire nail.

For the most part I really like going here. They do really great work. Every now and then I get a rush job or the nails are uneven. I had a super quick pedicure and felt like she rushed through it. I understand that it's a la carte but that's supposed to be a relaxing experience. They also don't let my feet soak long enough and I need to let them know that the water temp is always cold. I've been in the beauty business for many years and know what to expect. Again, for the most part they do a great job. Just don't be afraid to let them know what you want.< /Review>

Finally a great nail salon in Capitola! This place is clean, has a huge selection of colors and brands and they do an incredibly meticulous job on your hands and feet. I got a gel manicure and pedicure. A lot of salons I've been too feel rushed and don't always do a good job. The ladies at Tracy Nails took time to exfoliate my feet so well my heels feel like butter. My cuticles and nails are perfect too. I think I just found my neighborhood spot!<//Review>

<review>i would not recommend. i said i wanted a full set and they gave me a manicure. after they realized their mistake they made me pay and extra $5 for the inconvenience that they brought on themselves. i was clear with my instructions start to finish. they were being quite rude after and they were all giving me dirty looks. at the end my cuticles looked horrible, my nails looked bumpy, they were horribly painted, and they made me bleed 3 times.  this is the worst nail experience i’ve ever had.<//review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x808e156b61efbd0f:0x122ef6695167fecf</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>If I could rate a 0 I would. Did someones nails when they obviously had fungus. Heard the whole coversation and saw the nails. Then she went in with the drill to blow all that infectious powder everywhere. Just unsanitary. Went there for months, until this!< /review>< username>

< review>
I had an appointment for 10:00 this morning, and the girl was done in 17 minutes. 🙁. I come to get mani pedi once a month or more, and have good experiences before, but today was the worst experience.  The girl only trimmed two nail, didn’t file or trim cuticles.  The polish came off in two hours.  The lady next to me had fungus, but they still did her nails.  Very disappointed, will not go back.<//review>

*******My  resolution this year is to treat myself to pampering and girly treats.
I had such a good experience today. I got SNS nails today in a beautiful glittery grey-blue.  the technician that did my nails and she was very friendly and answered all my questions (I am new to fancy nails;). ) she made my formerly ratty nails look amazing and it made me feel more put-together and happy. Thank you for the good experience, attention to detail, great skills, and really nice customer service. ******(())</text>

Cheap, can't say it was clean or cozy. Not a great quality work either. But they are busy, and I can't compare to other nail salons in the area so maybe they are good for SC. But they are not good if you compare them to any salon in LA or SF.<//Text>

I do not recommend this place, in only of  for 3 days after getting my acrylics nails set put , it broke! I didn’t even do anything that could cause it to fall off, also rushed way to fast, and when doing the file it my sling around my finger nail started to burn! They also cut one of my fingers!</Review>

They will not give you as good as a massage or paint your toes alllll the way in the corners.  Other than that it's hard to go anywhere else. Great price, good cause, good service.<//Review><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

Wow!

A few years ago, I would get my nails done often and they never compared to the service I received at "Tracy Nails". I'm definitely staying with this salon every time I do my nails from now on.

The employees here are so kind. She's sat with us while we were getting our nails done and she was so easy to get along with and talk to! She made the whole experience so easy going and we didn't hit that awkward silence stage where you don't know what to do with yourself but stare at the wall.

This is the place to go to if anyone wants an amazing experience. They took their time on your nails too and made sure they looked perfect.<//Text>

So relaxing.  They do a fantastic nob with the biggest selection of polishes.  I'm picky with my polish.  Go to Tracy's nails and get your feet soaked.  My feet look cuter than ever now.  I'm really impressed with the remodel!! Nice Big screen TVs to watch.  Friendly staff and fair prices.< /review>

Very relaxing. I got the basic mani pedi. Good rate.
I have tried several different salons closer to my house and they just do not compete. Super friendly staff that always help pick out the right color. They take their time to do a perfect job. I have been going to this salon for 2 years and it is the cleanest most consistently excellent salons in the city.  I always leave happy! Can't wait to go back!<//review>

Very very rushed. The fastest pedicure I’ve ever had. Was not relaxing at all. From the time I walked in the door to the time I was sitting to dry was 19 minutes. Definitely not a 20 min massage. And they left so much polish on my skin. Not satisfied at all.</Text>

I am obsessed. I've been coming here for over  and refuse to go anywhere else. This is the best nail spa. So. Clean. They open fresh styling tools. The place is always so clean and stylish. Fruit infused water. Warm tea, fruit, coffee--the receptionist always offers beverages. Wine & mimosas! the owner is the sweetest  and always makes sure you're happy. My nails stay looking great for 3 weeks with sns. Relaxing music. Great selection of colors from gel to sns - cool designs and chrome too. I've switched so many friends to this place because they are sooo great!💧💧💧💧💧</review>

<text>In Capitola it's do hard to find mani and pedi for a good price along with a good staff. I'm all about hygiene and many places don't have that. I've never felt so blessed to do my hands and feet like this place. All the girl work excellent and take their time to detail. What I love most is the atmosphere I feel in the salon very welcoming. The color to choose from are almost infinite. I will definitely be coming back weekly to get my hands and feet done.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

I would not reccommend this place. Three of my nails broke in the span of a week, and it’s not like I do a lot of work with my hands. They also weren’t too friendly and they rushed my service. Their prices are cheap though so you get what you pay for.<//review>

Assembly line atmosphere.
I had 4 different techs, they switch around and don't tell you what you they're doing.
Good if you just need a quick mediocre mani or pedi.<//Text>

We've been coming here as a family (yep! Dad too!) for years. The staff is professional, welcoming, and their colors are organized by shade, which makes it so much easier; the color selection is great!

I have had both pedicures and manicures, and for each you see them open new utensils before starting. The default scent of the sugar scrub for the pedicure is lemongrass, which smells divine. The manicure came with an extensive arm and neck massage (which I appreciate but I was not aware was coming, so heads up if you're sensitive to touch outside a traditional massage).

Ask for a stamp card if they don't give you one, because you'll want to come back.< /text>

<Rating>2</Rating><Text>I was overcharged and the prices I was told were not what I was billed.  I went with my daughter. I had a French tip manicure and my daughter had her toes and fingernails painted (just the basic). At first I was so impressed with all the time they spent massaging our legs and such.  Well, without my asking, apparently they charged me extra for services I didn't ask for and in the end, the bill was like 25 dollars more than I expected.  Because I did not know what the norm was-we've gone once before many years ago-they totally took advantage of us. I had even been inquiring about the prices before we got started bc its hard for me to afford such luxuries.  The massaging chairs are great, but if you find yourself getting a long massage and a leg scrub you did not ask for, know that they WILL charge you extra.  So annoying!<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x808e156b61efbd0f:0x122ef6695167fecf</GmapID></record>

<text>I had a bad experience here. I called ahead for an appointment for dip nails. Right away I could tell the tech did not no what she was doing. She would not listen to me either. When removing my old set she over drilled an hurt my real nail beds several times. She cut my fingers with the drill in 3 places. When she was finally putting on the final top coat I kept telling her to put on clear gel. Of course the normal top coat did not dry. At least 5 techs came to look at my hands. It was awkward enough that the customer next to me asked if I had gotten something special.

Finally a different tech removed the top coat and put on gel. The whole process was 2 hours!!!!!!! Plus my nail beds are so sore this morning it’s like I got a new set.

I will never go here again.< /text><user>100210786735348985287< /user>< time>

I found her in Facebook and I saw all these pictures of the extensions she made I thought I'd try myself she charged me $400 for the hair extensions only one week after the hair looks really bad 4 weeks later I go to her and show her how my hair looks like she said I'll take it off for you so basically I paid $400 to use fake hair for 4 weeks she didn't offer me anything else and by the way she does a horrible job on lashes.< /review>

<Review>Why isn't the trigger happy lunatic guard in jail for shooting a person on a public sidewalk video taping? It is perfectly legal and 1st amendment right to film anything from a public area. Yet your officers handcuff the victim  who was shot by the guard through a fence. What the hell are you cops thinking?<//Review>< pictures>

Pretty crazy how one of your officers just lets a white guy wander to the front of his car. Out of sight of said officer opening the trunk. Completely blocking view between officer and driver. Dig in a backpack for his passport. I wonder, not a race issue yet. But a officer safety issue, better training. he could of been shot right then and there. The other issue is.....nobidy of color would of been allowed to enter the trunk of thier car without being detained and the officer helping himself to finding such items as a passport or ID. Time for a few workshops boys. Better training. Forwarding said video to who it may concern. Need lots of training.</Text>

The fact that there is a cop on the force that thinks you need a California drivers license to drive in California is ridiculous. This is  not how we expect our tax dollars to be spent. We would like better educated police officers. These issues start at the top with the leadership. Its important that there is good leadership that can be sure their officers are doing a proper job.  The cops on the job are as only as good as their leaders. Im curious as to if I can change this review in the future.<//Text>

He swings his arms and makes strange faces because he is autistic. Officer Diamond and her partner treated him like an actual human being, understood that the lady was being as rich entitled social justice warrior, and let him go.

This PD spends little time and effort educating their officers on the law. Just another PD full of people who can't handle the responsibility of authority.</review>

< review>
My friend, Sylvia, wanted to thank and commend the actions of Officer Bedo after she was in a recent car accident.  She was very upset after her accident so Officer Bedo called her husband directly to let him know she was ok.  Although her vehicle was drivable and no one was hurt, he offered her a ride home knowing how upset she was.  After declining the ride, he followed her home to make sure she was safe and gave her his phone number in case she had any questions or concerns.  Officer Bedo went above and beyond his duties and she wanted to let him know how much she appreciated the personal care he showed her.<//review>

<Review>A thief broke into my car in my driveway and stole several items. I called to report the incident and Officer Bedinian showed up within minutes to take the report. Soon after, Detective Burger called to say they had recovered my stolen items! Apparently the criminal was apprehended for another incident and they found the stolen goods on him. The BHPD officers worked backwards to trace the stolen items to me and my belongings were returned to me within 24hrs! Thank you to Officer Bedinian and Detective Burger for their prompt and outstanding work. I am a long time resident of BH and I am always so impressed with the level of expertise and congeniality of the department and officers.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

My car was broken into 3 months ago in the carport here in BH,and they grabbed an expensive pair of sunglasses and two cases of Diet Lemonade.  I didn't have the gall to report stolen lemonade to the BHPD and I let it go.  3 months later, same thing happens.  They grab another pair of expensive sunglasses and a case of Fresca.  Now I'm pissed.  I report the theft, two officers show up 10 minutes later and tell me they got the guys!    Inside the stolen car they nabbed that morning were my glasses, Fresca and some mail they grabbed off the front seat.  My thanks to Officers Kim and Huyhn.  100% professional.  Now to get my sunglasses back, now that the rain is gone......</review>

Respectable and friendly environment for the children. Barber are especially considerate and primarily working. Get work done as soon as possible (when there is no game on the television). Other than that, I'd say this place exceptional to go to.< /Text>

Best barbershop I've been to in a while. I highly recommend asking for Victor or Alex 😎</text></record>

<text>IF YOU WANT TO GET YOUR HAIR CUT HERE, MAKE SURE YOU MAKE AN APPOINTMENT.

If this shop is going to operate primarily on an appointment basis, then you should let walk-ins know or if you don't feel like greeting/talking to them to let them know the current wait time, just do away with the walk-in option all together and be an appointment only shop. Most people don't have two hours to spare to get their hair cut.
I left after an hour and a half of waiting. If an employee had approached me when I entered and said "Hey, just so you know, the wait time is about an hour." I would have scheduled an appointment and left, but no such effort was made.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

< Review>
Their business hours of operation aren’t up to date. i showed up for a walk in 90 minutes before their closing time. i even called beforehand and didn’t get an answer. shop was empty when i walked in and they just brushed me off saying they were closed, even though i showed up hours before closing. i guess you can say they’re not serious about their craft since they rather brush off a customer to catch up with old friends .<//Review>

<Text>Firs timer at this spot and last time. Sucks that they have to charge so much for a haircut I can get for $8 anywhere else. Guess I'll keep driving all the way to Boyle heights for my haircut where I wouldn't mind paying those high prices that "Pride" charges.</Text>< user_name>

<review>So visited this location with my gentleman friend. An impromptu date they don't come easy. So we entered and was greeted by a female greeter who asked a table for 2. Yes  we replied then we waited for her to see if they had a table. Long story short after 10 minutes we were seated a table for 6 when they had a booth for 2 available (cozier). Our garlic fries were cold, he said the onion ring tower was over cooked, it was a little,  then we kept getting interrupted rudely by our server. I still tipped adequately because I know times are rough. I hope my experience will be better next time.< /review><name>Ms. Lewis<//name></record></dataset><record>

Natalie is such a sweet person I swear. I came twice and she has the same attitude(bubbly,nice).  Around 5pm today was hectic do to large parties and such but she was in the front ready to take my takeout order.  She gave me a recommendation to a chicken sandwich that was so good. She knows the menu and I swear I never had that type of great service there before.  Definitely a breeze ordering takeout inside. Will come back loved the food!<//text>

<text>Our entire party is vaccinated and wearing masks, including 3 elders, we were told to wait outside in the sun till they had a table ready, about 20 min. We told them we are vaccinated and if we can at least keep our great grandma inside since she’s 90, they said no. Awesome customer service.<//text><user_name>Maria Oh< /user_name>< Rate>

<Text>It was way back back years. My friends and I ate in this place.

Today, I felt like it was my first time buying food at Red Robin. Well, I checked the website if they had a online order for pickup and yes I was happy for it. I ordered my food online and picked it up inside the restaurant. When I came in, I was entertained right away and she checked my order. I didn't wait too long for my order. Also, after she gave me my orders. She's explained what I ordered to make sure everything was correct. And the food I ordered were ready before I came. Also, a complimentary fries was given to me too. The staff that helped me was very nice and friendly. She made sure I received my orders right.

Good Food. Satisfied my cravings. Definitely using online orders in the future<//Text><time>1555298636384</time>< response>

<user>117081717985829970484</user><Text>Horrible overpriced burgers with nasty and unappetizing sides. Steak fries ugh at least to me. Their Mac and cheese for a minimal charge of course felt like straight out of a box...their service at least was pleasant. From the little girl who served us to the one who took our order. Everybody even the customers had a cool vibe going. We did go around 1pm for lunch so idk if that matters.</Text>< name>

We waited over thirty minutes to get a table but once seated the service and everything was great! Especially the delicious (bottomless) zucchini fries, though neither of us ended up getting seconds on them. We got plenty to begin with!< /Text>

< Review>
The burgers and food were good and the service was good the only thing that I did not like was the south paying monitor. For a party of five it messed up the entire payment and we just had to wait for a refund because we paid for the wrong thing which was kind of annoying but that’s it. I would just say pay upfront and don’t trust that machine.</Review>

Lots more choices on substitutions for fries. It can get crowded on weekends though. Bathrooms are clean. Located right off the freeway at a mall. Outside entrance. Parking can be a pain. The mall is usually so busy.  There's just something about a burger from Red Robin. Flavor is amazing. Juicy. Love the onion ring tower. Usually end up with their amazing cheese burger. And another burger of choice, depending on his mood haha! This time it was a smoked pepper. Was very good.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

My fiance and I came to eat here because it was one of the few restaurants offering indoor dining during these restrictive COVID times. The hostesses and servers were very kind, but the food was just OK. We both ordered a burger and fries; our burgers were hot and tasty, but the patties had that funky, frozen taste... our garlic parmesan fries were soggy. The prices were fair, we never leave hungry because of the bottomless fries at Red Robin.< /Review>

Where to start. I just did a to go order and it said it will be done around 15 minutes when I got there it was already pass the 15 minute mark. The server told me that my order wasn't done yet so I said okay and waited. WELL After standing there for an hour waiting another girl came up and asked if I was here to pick up an order and I said yes and right when she walked to grab my food GUESS  WHAT!!! It was just sitting there!! Now my food is soggy and the first girl never came back to check up on me. Do yourself a solid just go else where.</review>

<review>Been around forever and always solid. Great many choices in the sammich and burger area. Tasty as hell fries with the well known bottomless amount. Fun family restaurant but plenty of adult level tastes.< /review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOMIua9ap6mSs8uJVr0743YrkauaGHFoh2Dnyg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPA-ZG4EfgiWUONG1eu7oDK6dLjn38Ifo0bKoE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOsN-d6cj7fNSN6QxiT7ocuT7PsbVu48TliQk4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPVhzZaOFsobdQGn2ZNynsXmiZOVY-n3Uu8Vvg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPmrC9YoCJMjI4bLdd0iBV1avYGOR3nB7vfNUo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

Doordash driver. They have made pick ups so easy. Just a head up, as a delivery driver . Do not wait for the waiter/waitress by pick up. Go to through the double doors facing Lugonia street and they have a server there to help bring you your orders. Its kinda sad, they don’t give out free fries like they used to pre-covid<//review>

Friendly atmosphere, ate at bar.  Store was rather busy which speaks well of service. Restroom needed attention however.  Food was as ordered and reasonably hot.  Second basket of bottomless  fries were hotter than ones served with burger.  Overall very satisfying,  will return.<//text>

You gotta get the basket of fries with garlic fries and campfire sauce. This place has a burger for everyone. I’ve tried most of them and they never let me down. Great drinks, great environment. I remember getting the pretzel bites and beer cheese. I don’t know if that’s still on the menu but if it is, get it. You won’t regret it. The cheddar is somewhat sharp but it cuts through the salty pretzel perfectly. Grab a blue moon while your there. Cheers!<//text>

<review>Since this is a gourmet burger restaurant, I expect them to use real bacon on their burgers and not microwave bacon. Pretzel bites appetizers were good but only come with a small cup of cheese which isn't enough by any means, the waitress said extra cups were 75 cents each which was bad enough but when the bill came they charged us 99 cents each. So needless to say, we probably won't be dining here again anytime soon.<//review>< UserId.>

If I could remember right, I had the tavern burger with onions but the onions were not good at all. So if you go here, don't get the onions on the burger XD< /text>

< review>
Ok, at first, I was a little bit upset because I had made reservations a day before for 17 people for my daughters birthday, but when we got there, they said that they didn't even have reservations, but they told one of my party members that the reservation was made for 8 people, so I asked to speak with the manager who was there the manager actually told me that they don't do reservations anymore but if that was the case why did they even take down my reservation but he had offered to give us 2 free appetizers and would find us a table of 17 within 20 to 30 minutes he actually came through with it and the waitress was awesome and at the end of the billing they took off everybody's burger from there order so that made it even more excellent at the end of the night my daughter enjoyed her birthday dinner and we enjoyed our dinner there<//review>

Love the ambiance of this family friendly restaurant!  Has great all American food!  Love their thick french fries!  Hamburgers are delicious!  So, are there other numerous entrees!  The deserts are fantastic!  Servers are friendly & accommodating!  May have to wait if you choose a busy time but it is definitely worth it!</text>

Red Robin is... OK. They do a competent job with the burgers. I ordered the peppered bacon burger. On paper, along with extra sharp cheddar cheese described, it promised more than it delivered. You have a choice of cooking your hamburger medium or well. Mine was ordered medium and showed up much closer to well done. The bottomless fries are an appealing idea, but you are paying 15 bucks for the burger which includes them. The beer list is nothing to get excited about. My son did have a strawberry cream soda which was not nearly as sweet as I expected, and he seemed to enjoy it quite a bit. The staff was friendly and attentive. If I could give it three and a half stars I would have on the basis of the staff.< /Review>

<Review>Slow as hell. Made me really late for the delivery I already had in my back seat.
10 to 15 minutes is an acceptable wait time not 40 minutes.
No need to follow up. I Emailed the President/CEO.<//Review><time>1596014186338</time>< user_id>

<review>The service was phenomenal. The waitress taking our order was very friendly and efficient. We were a bit hangry going in but she handled us nicely. The food was delicious! We loved the bottomless fries and can say they have the best onion rings we've tried. 10/10 would eat again.< /review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPzj3JwYHtI4ICIAdUgMXrgJrXJUOLnCAO987KE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< Resp>

It was delicious and the staff was awesome and incredibly accommodating. However, that day, we were on a budget and I had no clue that we were going to pay an ENTERTAINMENT TAX. I was dumbfounded and my server lost part of her tip. Not the restaurant's fault. We had a great time there.</Review>

<rate>4</rate><Review>While their burgers are great, my current favorite is the salmon with unlimited steamed broccoli. It's so tasty. When I eat this for lunch or dinner, I don't feel like I must diet afterwards. My family members all love the burgers, but at this senior time of my life, I can't afford the calories. I love their Salmon!</Review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

<Text>When they brought out the food some of the food was cold then we had to wait for new food. Then we couldn't eat our food because we didn't have forks and knives and for the bottomless service for french fries and or drinks they were slow to get around to us.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

My wife and I were doing some shopping and felt like a good hamburger so we went to the Red Robin in Redlands.  I had the "burning love" hamburger. Can't beat it. It comes with a grilled jalapeno.  It's the best. Our server was great.</Text>

I went as a Christmas treat for our students in my classroom.  They enjoyed the endless fries. The server was very friendly  and understanding in which he helped not make the drinks too sugary. I was sad that they changed the recipe on the garlic fries.  My friend got the Nashville hot chicken wings I sampled it in which it was pretty good. I ordered the black and blue cheese burger it was good but the bread got soggy toward the end.<//Review>

Manager Miguel  August 2nd during covid was rude and told us (not sure if because we were a group from a church) that we shouldnt come expecting service..... Asked me to not give him attitude and walked away mumbling for me not to expect to get a seat with my son. Then went and bad mouthed me to my family who was seated. (Son is autistic and kept getting told to move away from umbrella while trying to ask Miguel for help)

Great burgers, bottomless fries, what more can you ask for. The service was good, and it was nice and cool inside; break from hot summer day. Seating was a little cramped, but it made for good comfort and coziness with the family. Our waitress tended frequently and seemed to address our needs before we had to ask for them. I call that great service. We got there at 430 and beat the dinner crowd, there was good parking, plenty of tables, and no wait time. Leaving about 530-6 we saw more and more people coming in. So if you like early supper, you'll avoid crowds. And again, I was really impressed with service.</Review>

Great fast food chain, personally think the service at the specific location is slow at times. Had to almost track down the waitress like I was hunting a wild animal a few times.

Other than that, it seems like the menu was revamped recently and there are lots of delicious foods to try. Make sure you get one of their strawberry lemonades.</Review>

<Review>Waitress, Nicole, was on point. The place was busy and she was still attentive to our needs. Dinner came quickly and was just as we ordered.

The gourmet burgers are very nice, and so does our shakes. They also got things to see as collectibles. I highly recommend going there for a burger fan or a appetite challenger! 😋🍔🍟🍨< /review>

Generally very good burgers, periodically offering a new flavor.  Bottomless fries. Peach tea and a myriad of beers.  [RR follows truth in advertising.  The menu states that the Tavern burgers are non-gourmet, substituting two thin patties. Definitely not as good as the others.] Place always busy even though a bit pricey. Non-burger items available.< /Review>

<Rating>5</Rating><user_name>Clara Enoch</user_name><Text>Celebrated a birthday dinner tonight and the service was amazing. We were a party of eleven and the waitress named Nicole was one of the best workers I have had the pleasure of meeting in the San Bernardino area.
She took our orders in a timely manner, and returned with all our order correct. A feat in itself, because everyone ordered different items. She even remembered who ordered what meal. Thank you Red Robin for hiring her.
In addition the food was excellent and the Manager-sorry I didn't get his name-was very pleasant and professional. I  recommend this restaurant if you would like a pleasant experience while you dine.< /Text>< Time>

We have enjoyed, for many many years, the best cod fish and chips available anywhere at Red Robin. That was the main motive for visiting your restaurant. Sadly, the last two visits, especially the most previous one, caused great disappointment. The pieces or content of the fish has decreased noticeably as well as the quality. Our order of three plates of fish was heavy and thick with batter, giving a doughy taste. This is not a fluke. The decision makers at Red Robin are succumbing to the profit trap instead of maintaining your quality integrity that made YOU who you are. This is a sad day for Red Robin.</Review>

One of the most courteous, professional and incredibly pleasant servers that I've ever experienced anywhere. His recommendations were spot on, including his own invention beverage consisting of sugar free peach syrup and ice water which was totally refreshing. In addition to the usual bottomless fries, he offered choices of broccoli, coleslaw and salad. Could not have asked for a more perfect dining experience.<//Review>

I mean, it's Red Robin, it's just like every other Red Robin. But at this particular location, the service at barside section is always exemplary, especially Diane (bartender) and Bri (server). Coworkers and I meet here regularly in the afternoons, despite being not the closest locationx and it's always a good time. Service is top notch.<//review>

I had such a great time that I didn't even take the time to take a picture, the food was fabulous, the service was amazing.and the milkshakes were out of this world! I will definitely be going back! There's too much to choose from to just go once. Next time i will try one of their drinks from the bar. And they have a great atmosphere as well... This is a Must try spot. ❤❤❤<//text>

I'm a little disappointed with my visit. There to celebrate my wife's birthday, she ordered a burger and I got the Avo-cobb-o salad. To my surprise the salad actually had no avocado in it. It was a basic Cobb with grilled chicken. While I could forgive the kitchen error, the rest of both meals left much to be desired. The burger was undercooked and the chicken overly so. The steak tartare is palatable but a chicken puck made the meal, ... Well be careful, quality control was lacking last night in the kitchen.< /Text>

<review>Lots of greats sandwich and burger choices. Salads are good too. If you come on the weekend you are gonna wait for a while for a table, but the service once you get your table will be good. There's a reason why this location is always so busy. Try the Whisky River burger or chicken sandwich. I can't remember anything I've tried here that was not good. The table top game system is a hit with the kids, and makes it easy to pay your bill without having to wait for the check.<//review><gmapID>0x80dcaa596f3c7043:0x62587003300b2e44< /gmapID>< resp>

<review>It was very dirty to start; the table was ok, but the carpeted area had trash littered all over and didn't get cleaned up for an hour. The food was good, but I can honestly say Red Robin's quality has dropped over the years. Their burgers used to be excellent and quite a good size, but now they're just okay and not so big. It was disappointing to see that to be honest cause I used to love the restaurant. All in all, the food, the service, and the atmosphere are generally worth the money you spend, but don't expect a quality experience or meal. Mediocre is their aim.<//review>< Pictures>

A really nice family friendly restaurant. I joined the "Birthday Burger Club" a few years ago & you can get a "FREE" burger anytime during your birthday month! You have to sign up using your email, since that's how they contact you! I haven't missed a year yet! 👍☺</Text>

Not so great for those of us who don't care for burgers that are loaded with condiments that we can't pronounce. Still, I would recommend it. Oh, and when they are busy, you can't hear yourself think. I left with a headache from the noise level.< /review>< Pictures>

Excellent place to hangout with friends and family. Service was excellent, thanks to our server Candi ;-)

Tuesday was happy hour all-day. Small plates serving was delicious! Bar was crowded and had lots of Martini specialties.  I wish they would carry more local craft beer (Ritual, Escape, 3 Iron, and Wild Donkey) since they only had Hangar 24.<//review>

It's a really nice place but I personally think the fries need be salted a little bit more but still love the place ❤</Review>

Great service. Right on top of it. Friendly too. Unlimited fries. Huge beers. Beer was fresh, glass ICE COLD! Food was reasonably fast, delicious. Place was packed on a weekday. I see why. This chain has it together. I' am not a chain restaurant guy, but excellence here. Well-managed. Great atmosphere without annoying bright lights.</text>

I have a SEVERE allergy to tomatoes and they have always gone above and beyond for me. This is one of the few places I can trust my life with. The manager usually comes out to assure us of the steps taken to insure my safety. Red Robin ROCKS!!!</Review>

<Text>Im not a burger fan, but as a veteran I get a free burger once a year. Its good. I am picky about the buns, but they have many choices to meet the needs. The clam chowder and fried fish is amazing. endless fries and onion rings campfire style is the only way to go and plenty of ranch.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x80dcaa596f3c7043:0x62587003300b2e44< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

We didnt even have one on our table. Food was fine. But if they charge that to a lot of people they make some good money. Just got, sorry it should not have been charged. Not worth driving back.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

<review>Wow, delicious burgers, can be a bit pricey, but I think it's worth it! Although there usually isn't a wait (or very short one) the service can be a bit slow and the restaurant offers bottomless fries but brings them out once were done and ready to leave. Fries are something quick we should get easily.< /review><GmapID>0x80dcaa596f3c7043:0x62587003300b2e44<//GmapID><Rate>5< /Rate><Resp>None</Resp><pics>None<//pics><time>1461636955749< /time>< UserId.>

Our server Kathleen was on point and very nice. She definitely made the experience pleasurable. The environment was lively and felt like an all around enjoyable place to be at.</Review>

A bit pricey for a burger! I’ve been twice now, and yet to have been offered a second helping of the endless fries! Their not hurting for business, but they got my last dollar!< /Text>

Food was excellent, the royal red Robin burger on gluten free bun, and endless (allergy) fries, even the fresh brewed ice tea has a good bold flavor. However, somewhere in the process my food was contaminated with gluten, even though I said I was very intolerant, and I'm spending time near bathrooms till it passes</Text>

Red Robin has options for ordering gluten free. They have a gluten free bun or a lettuce wrapped burger. They also fry their French fries separately, so if you have to eat gf, the fires should be safe to eat. They will provide you with an ingredients list if you ask for one but most of the burgers are gf. I enjoy eating here.< /text>

Only part that is negative for me is the amount of noise.  While I wear heading aids, this place can be so noisy, it is difficult to hear those I am sitting with. Kind of a bummer because I really enjoy the place, but if you can't hear because it's so noisy it distracts from a good experience.<//Text>

Used Royal Rewards card and we got the deal of the week (buy one gourmet burger and get second half price).  Meal was good and we loved getting a deal on lunch!  RR's change weekly, but, worth signing up.< /text>

<Review>Good service and the food was also pretty good, however their restrooms were beyond disgusting and filthy. It was gross and it's not the first time their  restroom's were in this conditions. Management should be held accountable for their condition. It  make's your  wonder what their kitchen looks like.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

Came to red robin on a slow Monday at 3:30pm. I was seated right away in the bar area. The server was nice and polite but that's all that was good about the trip. My girlfriend and I both ordered water. The cups were dirty and still had sticky, sugary residue on the inside of the cup that would fall into our water if we wiped it. We had ordered a royal robin burger cut in half to share and bottomless garlic fries. The cook brought our burger out but it was not cut in half and he just gave us an extra plate. That wasn't a big deal to us so we just cut the burger in half ourselves. When I tried to place the half of the burger on the other plate, it had cheese on the plate and was dirty. Then the cook brought us regular fries instead of the garlic ones we ordered. I told him and he went ahead and brought us our fries. The whole time our server was missing for ten minutes. We had to push the "call server" button on the ziosk to get her attention. I told her about the water and how dirty they were and she was polite and brought us new ones which were still dirty! Then we asked for more fries and she brought us regular fries again. We just accepted it and said we were never coming here again.<//Text>

Dont ever allow a customer to wait 30 minutes for a hamburger only to have it serve ice cold. The waiter simply forgot her order was up or had a larger table to wait on. Disappointing< /review>

It's a great place for burgers, that's for sure. Just avoid going on weekends; It's overy packed, loud, and service is slow. Anytime M-Th you get great service, calmer atmosphere, and almost no wait time.</review>

My burger tasted wierd, and I should have followed my instinct because 20 mins later I was in the bathroom sick. Spent the whole evening sick. I love Red Robin, first time I've ever been to one with bad food. The staff is awesome. Too bad the burger poisoned me on my birthday. 😓< /Review>

Dont ever allow a customer to wait 30 minutes for a hamburger only to have it serve ice cold. The waiter simply forgot her order was up or had a larger table to wait on. Disappointing<//text>

Everytime we come here its great! I was observing everyone and they all use teamwork to get the job done. Romero the busser bust his butt to turn these tables! Just watching him work hard to get the job done is why this restaurant flows so smoothly. Thanks red rob employees for making everytime great! Romero keep up the good work! Trust me, it does pay off one day!</text>

Burgers are a bit pricey, service can be a bit slow during the lunch rush. Food taste is good, lots of good choices. Have a tavern burger to get out on the cheap.<//Review>

If I could give this place negative stars I would! Me, my fiance, his mom, and a family friend all went there to eat and all 4 of us got so sick we all ended up throwing up in the parking lot. The fries we received with our meals and the second baskets that were brought out were cold and extremely old and stale. They were insanely greasy and all but burnt. We we're told the kitchen was closed but they would  make us fresh fries. These last ones came out hot and golden like they should have been so obviously what we got was far from fresh. The water was disgusting, it was cloudy, it smelled weirdand left a bad taste in the mouth. Of the 4 meals we got, 1 was missing things requested, 1 was totally overdone and all of them were definitely sitting out for a while because they weren't hot like they should have been. On top of all this, when we complained about the fries the server didn't even seem to notice and when the manager came over he acted like we ordered them extra crispy and that it was our fault. He took a couple dollars off  the bill and filed a report. When we all got sick before even making it to the car, and mind you we were parked front row next to a handicap spot, my fiance went back in to complain again. None of the staff asked if we were ok or anything, they just told us that the stores insurance will contact us and there's nothing they can do. They didn't care at all, they literally watched all of us getting violently sick and didn't care at all. I will never go back to this restaurant at all, they allow bad food to be served and don't do anything about it getting customers sick. Disgusting, absolutely disgusting. Never go here, spend your money elsewhere, where the food is cooked right and rhe staff gives a care.</Text>

The childrens pizza crust is too thick tastes dry not enough sauce.
Fried pickles too much breading no flavor, sent the back. Slow service.
We go there often, very  disappointed.<//Text>

<text>I ordered to go meals for me and my family. I sent my husband they went over the order without actually showing him the food. My husband came home and we realized they forgot part of my meal. I called hospitality line and all she could say was sorry and they could have it ready if I went back for it. I do not live 5 minutes away and I would be wasting money on gas to go get something I had already paid for and they forgot to pack. No thank you.< /text><date>1465172256514</date><gmap_id>0x80dcaa596f3c7043:0x62587003300b2e44< /gmap_id><Rate>2<//Rate>< user_id>

<text>This is a cute little place full of little trinkets, collectables, and antique items to be seen while you wait. They have the usual Tv's for your entertainment as well, and as the title of the restaurant, the burgers are extremely good. Just the fries... The fries in my opinion are a little funky, but still oftly good, you should really try their original wing sauce with them though, it makes more than up for the funkiness though.< /text>< pics>

One of my favorite places to visit with my family.
The good: excellent food
Restrooms are in good shape, the manager is always around.
The bad : personal no so friendly ( waiters )  the carpet  not always clean , there's staff at the entrance who doesn't open the door even if you are carrying 2 babies on your arms.< /review>

<rating>5</rating><text>Every time I come here, the service and food are excellent. (Reading through the reviews, I am appalled at the unintelligible writing skills of many of the "critics"- which makes me wonder how old they are..)
Anyway, I would take most of the bad reviews with a grain of salt (pun intended!) I live in Redlands, and this location always has gracious service, clean dishes and utensils and handles a bustling crowd very well. I never had a waitress tip herself, nor have I been treated with rudeness.
I also love that they have Boca burgers, and that you can have them served any way they do a burger. The food is great!<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

Good burgers but cocktails are weak. The seasoning for the French fries is very good. Burger selection changes several times a year, so it's nice to visit and see a new burger.</Review>

<Text>Never coming back. Extremely racist; waitress gave me rude stares, and I felt extremely unwelcome. Chicken was half cooked, and the amount of food is not worth the price. For people who want to love America, this place and its attitude to people who look like me makes them want to feel the opposite.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

The childrens pizza crust is too thick tastes dry not enough sauce.
Fried pickles too much breading no flavor, sent the back. Slow service.
We go there often, very  disappointed.< /Text>

So yummy!! Don't sit outon the patio when it's like 4:30 to 5:30 because you'll end up having to move all the umbrellas just to block the sun.</text>

<text>Order a vegan burger. Smallest burger I have ever seen. They didn't have avocados so I was to get guacamole. Didn't. Was supposed to get broccoli. That was a no show also. Never going back.< /text>< pictures>

<Response>None</Response><Pictures>None</Pictures><Text>I expect to have mediocre service anytime I  go out to eat, alone with my kid(s) when they're of a certain age. This time was no different. My youngest is one. I enjoy going out with my kids individually, no matter the age. In occasionally take them to non family ftiendly reataurants and sit down restaurants because it's a good experience for us. While the wait staff rolls their eyes and begs to not have me and my babbly baby sat in their section, it seems anymore I receive the same courtesy at an avg sit down restaurant, like Red Robin. The host was friendly and welcoming. The server had her hands full, however my service compared to other tables was sub par at best. Instead of leaving my usual 40% tip, I left her with 27%. Enough for her to notice and be surprised as eell as wonder what she would have received had she been a bit more present. Once we get our food, the kid is like a vacuum and we're ready to bounce in 15min. It's not like we have anything to talk about.
As usual, the food was excellent and brought in a timely manner. Being able to pay at the tablebis a great bonus!<//Text>< userid>

It's a good burger place. Kind of expensive. They have "bottomless fries". But the burgers are huge so usually you will barely finish and not need to get more free fries. There's a bar to eat and drink at.</Review>

They don't seem to have the huge, monster burgers anymore - but they have more reasonable sized burgers, with subtler flavors, so it all balances out.

I had the Smoke & Pepper burger, and enjoyed it.<//Review>

<review>Well first it started with the hostess who literally walked like a snail and acted like she didn’t have any idea where we were going to sit at first lol then our waiter (Joey) literally had to be on something bc he kept forgetting to bring things that we asked for like the bottomless fries, spoons, napkins ect. He even came to our table two different times and brought a sprite and asked us “you ordered a sprite?” Also, the garlic fries literally were dripping with grease. The food otherwise was good but unfortunately this is our second time here giving a second chance bc the first time had bad service too. But once again it was bad service so we will not be coming back. We are not ones to ever complain either so this is super disappointing to us. Hope this helps.</review>< Pics>

My girlfriend and I went here on Saturday 12/11/2015. She ordered a burnin love burger which is suppose to come with jalapenos well it didn't so we asked for some no big deal. Halfway through her burger she realized it was pink inside and asked for it to go. The next day she started feeling sick and today 12/13/2015 she woke up feeling reaaally sick. She had to leave work early from throwing up and diarrhea. I would not recommend this place if the cooks can't even cook a burger correctly. I don't care how busy you are that's a health hazard.<//Text>

<text>The food has been lacking a bit lately and the service has gone downhill overall. That, coupled with how busy the center itself has gotten, and it's not necessarily worth going all the way up here unless it is on an off night.<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

< Review>
Disappointed- had a bday dinner with family here and we were all disappointed by the mediocre food. The burgers weren't great. I ordered the chicken sombrero salad thinking it was going to be comparable to the santa fe salad from bjs... what a disappointment it was merely a ready mix pack of soggy wet lettuce funny thing is I had just thrown out a bag of salad mix at home that was exactly as wilted as the one served for $10 here.</Review>

<text>For some of you who don't have yelp , I would like to share with you, On 5/30th 2016 I had the worst experience of my life in Red Robin. It started very innocent.
We told the hostess we were going to sit in the bar. Some thing we have done a million times.  We asked a male server if we could sit at a booth and he knotted it was ok.
We sat for about 5 minutes which was ok I went to the restroom,  when I got back  a waitress was serving another table that came in after us and my husband asked if we were invisible over here. Sort of making a joke. The waitress said that we were not aloud to sit there and that we needed to be seated by a hostess and that you had stole someone's table. After explaining that we were not told that. She got rude I got embarrassed be on believe. As we walked away she gave us the Bye Felicia. I can not believe this girl is working in Hospitality.
Pretty much in a nut shell I was so embarrassed by the whole seen I left in tears. Good job on customer service. I will never drive all the way from Reche Canyon to eat here ever again. Plus I never want to see her face again. Up date so I have found 2 amazing places to replace Red Robin.
Eureka Burger near the University on Pearl and Five Guys off Alabama.
smaller places, more personable. They are musts if you like gourmet burgers and Eureka has a great selection of Micro brews to go with that Burger.<//text><gmapID>0x80dcaa596f3c7043:0x62587003300b2e44< /gmapID></record>

The most disappointing, humiliating,and shocking experience i have ever had here. Kaylin the waitress and Miguel the manager were rude and disrespectful beyond belief. Basically it felt like i was in an embarrassing dream. My family has been coming here for years, long before it got so busy. This particular night it was my daughter and i. It started out by waiting for over an hour to be seated when we were told it would be 30 min. Ok so thats understandable since they were busy. The craziness began when we asked for fries while we were deciding what to order. (Which we'd always done in the past without any problem) We were told by the waitress (kaylin) that we could only get fries if we were ordering them with our meals. We'd never been told that before but my daughter said she was going to order the clucks and fries so we were covered. She took our order and i asked for more fries and some ranch to go with them. She left and came back empty handed and preceded to tell me that only my daughter could have fries cuz they come with her meal and i ordered fruit not fries. I said "fine i wont eat any of them", but i was becoming increasingly offended by her condescending attitude and quite frankly confused by the entire conversation.  As if we were trying to steal fries. I had never felt so harrassed for asking for fries. She said it wasn't her that makes the rules it was her manager (Miguel) and she didnt care if i ate the fries. So why the hell are we having this conversation then???. I asked for the check cuz by now we are both completely digusted with this place. She leaves and the manager walks over and just stands at our table staring at my daughter not saying a word. I'm waiting for his excellant customer service to kick in but it never came. I broke the awkward silence by asking for the check so i could pay for our drinks and fries. He told us not to worry about it. So i didnt!!!  Oh i would like to add from a previous visit. The waiters do tip themselves. So check your charges. They add their own tips on to the bill whether they deserve it or not.< /Review>

We had an awful experience. We waited 30 minutes past what we were initially told and then they stuffed 8 of us in a booth intended for 6. The service was slow and incomplete. I wish I could say this has been my first bad experience here, but it was not.<//review>
