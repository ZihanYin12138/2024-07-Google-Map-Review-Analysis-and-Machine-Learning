<Review>A rare find these days, best of the best...

I’ve had my vehicle(s) serviced at the old location and followed him to this location because I have never been disappointed. They are quality customer focused, very friendly, and helpful.

Once my new vehicle service contract was complete they are my go-to place. When the dealer identified a repair or additional service required, I took it to Tom’s for quick and cost-effective repair/service.

I’ve purchased tires, had the brakes done, and many other services on my vehicles. Had a ’75 Jeep that they helped breath new life into it. Even provided me tips on items that I foolishly decided to do on my own.

Always kept me in the loop on progress and timely execution. Even recommended that some service  was not necessary at that time.

Recently went in for oil change and tire rotation. Quick and efficient. Thank you Tom and team for being there<//Review>< rate>

Called a shop in Lakewood that was over a week out appointment and then called Tom's.  Victor answered the phone and was super friendly, he said if I dropped off the car he could get me in today and that is just what he did.  Only took about 10 minutes to get checked in with paperwork, Sam helped out and was super friendly.  They initially estimated it being ready by about 5pm, they ended up calling me early at 3pm.  Pretty impressed, super friendly, busy shop in a good way, you know they are taking care of their customers.  Will definitely be back.<//Text>< pics>

They said it was too complicated. Fair enough. I did it myself. They told me to come back and get an alignment when i finished. Well I installed 99% of the lift myself and needed help with one more part. Tom’s turned me away again saying they won’t touch the car because they don’t know how to do it. It’s a 99 Honda CR-V it is the easiest car to work on. The one part would have taken 20 minutes. So disappointing. Never coming back.</review>< pictures>

I have used Toms tires for about five years you know batteries brakes low tire pressure I have mini coopers and they are certified and the service advisors are rock stars ! The mechanics rock my socks! They are always working hard greeting the customers with a smile I had the opportunity to meet the owner Tommy really friendly and found out they are a family owned business for decades I know some places you don’t even get a have a nice day anymore but not at Toms tire I felt safe and I had made the right choice for my after market repair car needs with certified professional family owned automotive service Toms tires< /Review>

They Keep Their Promises.
Prompt efficient and professional service by administrators and mechanics. I got an accurate assessment of the problem, the time required to fix it and the cost. I will never go elsewhere with my cars as long as I live in Southern California. The Best There Is!!<//Review>

Most of them just say “we can do an inspection first, then begin from there”, the inspection costs $80-130. Only two or three of them give me a range. Tom’s directly give me an exact number, which is the lowest.
After I drop off my car there, they finished everything the same day, and waiting for me to pick up even after their business hours! The staff is super nice and helpful, will definitely recommend this place to my friends!<//text>< gmap_id>

{'time': 1608329685133, 'text': 'Mr. Kaiser,\nI’m not sure what prompted this 1 star review 8 months after service.  Your complaint about rear brakes and “sweet time” is subjective. We repaired your brakes in a timely fashion to such satisfaction you returned for additional services on your air conditioning 3 months later. Furthermore after reviewing the price you paid it was not out of line, whatsoever, or you would not have returned for additional service. Finally, if your rear brakes were “loose” we would have gladly remedied the problem. We stand 100% behind our work and customer service. I’m always on the side of the customer but this is more of slandering a small family business.'}<//Resp>

I came in, I knew it was going to be a rip off by how expensive the cars were in the shop. They said they’d give me a free brake inspection. I agreed without knowing that if it was deemed “too bad,” they wouldn’t allow me to drive it away! He ended up quoting me $450 or I had to tow it away. NONE OF THIS WAS SAID UPFRONT. If I had known it would be held hostage, I never would have taken the free inspection. A tow can be $150! I don’t have this money! I’m now afraid to have them do any more work because I’m not sure I will be told upfront what money it will take to simply be put back together. I’m sad and upset that I stopped here. Definitely never coming back again. Try Art’s Brake Service instead. Juan is actually honest.<//review>

May 20, 2020

I Have used Tom's for years on and off but in 2018 I bought a new set of tires for my STI. I just had the oil changed at Timon's Subaru and they wanted $30+ to rotate the tires. I had a feeling when I bought the tires from Tom's they mentioned free rotation for the life of the tires so I called out of the blue and sure enough that is a thing. A day later they had the car booked in, rotated tires and checked the breaks, which to my relief are good for another 12 months.

All this in a clean Safe, friendly environment. Everyone there was courteous and I was in and out in less than 30 mins. Hardly time to make use of the free wifi.
You expect good service when you are paying a lot of money for something, but this was all zero $ and they didn't find a single thing to say " sir we noticed this and recommend we carry out the work for you", just good old professional service, I feel like I have "a car guy who doesn't rip you off".

Great job Tom's, 5 stars!!<//review>

Good service but most of all great work.  Took my truck to a different alignment shop b4 going here.  My truck drove worse. Then I took my vehicle here and the alignment came out great. Since then have brought a few cars here, and always great results.</Text>

Great from start to finish. Had my front and rear brakes done, all new tires, windshield wipers replaced, oil change, and everything under the hood inspected. Victor is a model shop manager. He has a great attitude,  is proffesional, and explains services step by step. I can't say enough good things about Victor and Tom's Auto shop. Great for Veterans!< /text>

Took "OJ" to Tom's for an alignment.  Found them via Google search and couldn't be happier.  Most shops don't want to or can't do an alignment on a lifted vehicle.  I called them up and they were happy to do it.  The shop was super clean and organized and everyone I spoke to was very professional and knowledgeable.</Review>

I was skeptical only because I have never taken my car to a 3rd party mechanic. For 10 yrs I have went to Infiniti. I am very pleased with the level of service. And my car is running great. They suggested a diagnostic test and saved me a boatload of money, I'll say the dealer was not so honest, or affordable, with their service recommendations. So, looks like I found a good mechanic.  5 stars well-earned because I left my wallet on their table and they called me repeatedly to inform me and had it waiting, everything fully in tact, when I got back to the shop. Honesty matters. Very pleased.<//review>

I've been going to Tom's for over a year now and I appreciate that they don't take advantage of women. They're extremely fair and very pleasant to deal with. I wouldn't take my car anywhere else.  Added bonus....the bathroom and waiting room is very nicely decorated and clean!!!  They have that small town family feel where they remember you by name.</text>

I took my smart fortwo here for alignment (they were recommended by Madness Autoworks). It turned out my car had more serious issues, but they were able to quickly resolve the problem after diagnosing it and even provided a rental when the repair was delayed due to wrong part sizes.
Everyone was very friendly, they went above and beyond. The waiting area has a tv, cookies, a Keurig, and a fridge with assortment of beverages. My car's steering wheel warning light came on right after I left and they were super accommodating, checking everything over to be sure the car's functioning and safe. Very satisfied with how everything turned out and would 10/10 bring my car back here again.
*Update* brought my car in after an accident that broke my wheel, and it needed many repairs. Tom's was able to diagnose and attend to my vehicle in a matter of days. I was astounded-- my car is performing better than before the accident. The professionalism and expertise with which everyone at Tom's maintains is leagues beyond any automotive shop or mechanic I've ever taken my car to (which there's been many of). They truly care about the car owners and their safety while on the road, and that's not even considering that this model car presents many challenges due to its small size and difficulty in parts availability. I am totally a customer for life, Tom worked with me on getting the best performance with my available budget, and again went above and beyond in customer satisfaction. I give them 110% grade, seriously.<//review>

<Review>Long story best kept short.  Nice people seem to run the place but over the years I became increasingly disappointed with repair orders.  More than once a problem seemed actually worse when the car was ready.  Most recently I ask for the basic wheel rotation, balance, and alignment and if I hadn't taken the car elsewhere to pay to have it done properly I'd have lost my mind.  Jeeze, if you cant handle an alignment....  I spent a lot of money at this place.  No more though.<//Review>< rate>

New to Long Beach and needed to check my wheel alignment. After another shop informed me they couldn’t perform it on my car and that I need to go to the dealer, Tom’s was able to do it! Couple of weeks later after getting a puncture in my tire, I returned to have them patch the hole and they fixed it for free! Both times the staff showed great customer service and professional work ethic. I usually go to a dealer to have my car serviced but Tom’s is my new go to.</Text>

I can't quit my 2005 MINI, as much of a high-maintenance diva he is. Recently, he leaked from everywhere a car could leak and left me stranded in a parking lot. After the towing, Tony worked on it and kept it nearly a week. Jason got me a loaner car, and when the car was ready, it drove, literally, better than ever. I had the same smile on my face as when it was new.

The guys bent over backward to make sure that the extended warranty paid a good chunk of the repairs, which were extensive. The waiting room is sparkling clean, and the bathroom even smells good.

Dealership repairs--nunca mas!< /text>

<review>Both my wife and I only buy our tires from Tom's.  Best place in Long Beach for tires.  If you get a screw or nail in a tire they sold you, they fix it for free.  I live in a neighborhood with a lot of construction going on.  I end up picking up a screw or nail every once in a while and it's a pain to fix.  At least it was until I started buying tires from Tom's.  To me the fixing service alone is worth it to me to be loyal and always buy tires from Tom's.< /review><pics>None</pics><Response>{'time': 1550606254694, 'text': 'Thank you very much for the 5 star review.

I worked with Victor who is great. Sometimes as a woman I have experienced condescending treatment from mechanics.

Walked in to make an appointment and the guy there was pretty rude and didn’t make me feel welcomed, not sure if he was having a bad day or something but I did not appreciate the hospitality.<//Review>

After reviewing your review with all the staff, I found that your review is unfair as you were more demanding than my staff was rude.

Excellent service. Fast and cost effective. They've been helpful and honest when I need 1 tire or 4, and have had variety of options for me to choose from at different price points. Highly recommend!</text>

I came from Indiana to visit my son in LA. I noticed a loud noise from the front wheel of his car and told him it needed checked right away.  We looked on Google maps and found Tom's to have good ratings. The main thing for me is to find someone honest and felt good at Tom's.  We got there early the next morning and they took care of us right away. We were on our way to San Diego and didn't want a broken down car to ruin our vacation plans.  Jason got the wheel bearing fixed and we were on the road by 10:00am.  Excellent service.  Thanks to the crew for saving us!</text>

Since Tom's moved to its new location on Anaheim St., I travel twice as far to bring my cars in for service. The reason is simple: peace of mind that my cars are well-maintained and safe. Every contact with Tom and service reps Thony and Jason have been friendly, straight-forward, and professional.< /Text>

I'm an electrical contractor, so I'm buying tires on a pretty steady basis. I've been in business since 1980, and we've been buying tires from Tom's for so long I can't remember when we started. Through all that time they've been consistently easy to deal with, their prices are competitive, and whatever they fix stays fixed.</Review>

< Review>
I got a flat tire on Thursday and I went back to Walmart where I purchased it, to get it replaced.  First they did not have the tire in stock, so they put on my tiny spare tire, told me that they could order it, I would have it the next day and they would call me when it arrived.  Well no call came, so I called them in the late afternoon on Friday.  They said they had my tire and to come and they would put it on for me.  I arrived and waited well over an hour and they did nothing, then they came in and told me they did not have my tire, and that there were plenty of local tire shops close by where I could get another tire....really.

So I packed up my car and went on google to find a tire shop in the area.  Needless to say I was concerned because it was the end of the day and my spare is only good for 50 miles.  A whole list came up, but only one with a 5 star rating and it was Tom's Tire Pros.  I called them around 5:00 pm on a Friday, and they close at 5:30pm.  I explained what I needed and the tire size, and he said to me I just replaced one of those tires for a guy 10 minutes ago, and if you can get here in 10 minutes, I'll take care of you.  So I got there in 10 and they took my keys and changed my tire in minutes.  They treated me like I was a long time customer and I was introduced to some of the guys who work there and we all joked around.  I was very impressed with their service, their friendliness, and their honesty about questions regarding other services that they offer.  I would highly recommend their shop if you are in need of new tires.  They were $15 cheaper than Walmart and the service was really great!  I definitely will be returning to their shop.  Thanks guys for a great experience.<//Review>

I have Maxcare though Carmax and needed repairs to my car. The Maxcare website had this facility listed and it was near my home. I was able to book an appointment online but I waited a few days to confirm since most places I've been to claim I never made an appointment. When I called to confirm, I was greeted very warmly and had all my questions answered. When I arrived at my appointment time, I was greeted very warmly again and loved the amenities offered in the lobby while I waited to be seen. I dropped off my car and they called me about 2 hours later to let me know unfortunately my car needed to be repaired at a dealership because the job was beyond what they could do at their shop. Even though they couldn't really do much, I will definitely be back for minor services because of how friendly and prompt they were to me. Thank you!!</Review>

Riley came out to give me an estimate to wax an area on my 2017 black Toyota Camry. I had it repaired after it was swiped by a red truck. He was extremely honest at the fact that the correction might be too deep and the it might have stripped the clear coat. He tested the area first a few times and took his time before deciding to move forward. He was honest and reasonable and did a fantastic job. We will be hiring him for future jobs.</text>

Riley did a great job on my wife’s Honda Accord. He did a wash, clay bar, and polish along with wheel detailing and the car looks better than it has in a long time. I use to detail my cars myself, but with Riley’s excellent work and reasonable prices, he has the job now!< /Review>

<Text>I called The Car Wash Guy after two previous detailers flaked and never showed up.  Riley came out on a Sunday to do a small carpet/seat cleaning job.  He was very respectful.  I told him what I needed done, and he explained how he would treat it. Riley then spent over an hour cleaning my carpet and seat.  He did an amazing job.  My carpet and seat are back to new.  Riley prices were very reasonable. I will also highly recommend The Car Wash Guy. Thank you Riley for great customer service.</Text></record>

My cat had an accident in my car on our way to the vet and I was so desparate to get rid of the smell in my front passenger seat that I was considering getting rid of the whole seat and replacing it. This guy did an amazing job and so far, several days later, it seems my seat is still clean! I was afraid the smell would come back with how hot it is up here, but its been great so far! Will recommend every chance I get. :)<//review>

Riley, shows up as we had talked ,and he introduced himself. He was straight on what he was selling, he told me he would do his best, have you know inside this SUV, was terrible to top it off my daughter,  put baking soda on the carpet, then sprayed vinegar inside,uh worst smell ever, Riley. Is the man, very good job definitely call him again,

<Text>Riley, you deserve more than a five star rating. Recently had  a full mobil detail and the quality of of work and how it turned out was fantastic. He explained his services and was very clear of how he would do it. I took the offer of strip wash, nanoskin exfoliation, and sealant, and also protection to the leather upholstery. He took his time making sure all areas were cleaned and sealant applied and very methodical. During this time I spent time asking questions on what he was doing and he would stop and give me a through explanation in detail and showed patience. Great price and will have him back to detail my wife's car.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Could not beleave they washed my truck in 112 degree weather! With little to no water used to achieve the job, (Eco Friendly Wash!) My big old truck looked beautiful when it was finished. I will be scheduling by-weekly details moving forward highly recommend using for your car wash needs!

Thanks guys,
Armando.</Review>

Awesome job! The eco waterless carwash was amazing and took out all the water spots off my car. I am often driving through the mountains and he was able to clean all the tree sap and bug guts off my car. My car looked like it was brand new! He cleaned my interior and it looks amazing. He showed up right on time and was quick yet efficient. Very professional and hardworking man! Will use this service again.</Text>

So this guy did an awesome service. He was here for 3 plus hours. He is a young guy and I was sceptical but this guy knew what he was doing. My car looks like a showroom vehicle plus he got the smoke smell out of my car. I had to tip him. Thanks again man! You will be my detailer for now on.</text>

Riley came out to give me an estimate to wax an area on my 2017 black Toyota Camry. I had it repaired after it was swiped by a red truck. He was extremely honest at the fact that the correction might be too deep and the it might have stripped the clear coat. He tested the area first a few times and took his time before deciding to move forward. He was honest and reasonable and did a fantastic job. We will be hiring him for future jobs.<//text>

I called The Car Wash Guy after two previous detailers flaked and never showed up.  Riley came out on a Sunday to do a small carpet/seat cleaning job.  He was very respectful.  I told him what I needed done, and he explained how he would treat it. Riley then spent over an hour cleaning my carpet and seat.  He did an amazing job.  My carpet and seat are back to new.  Riley prices were very reasonable. I will also highly recommend The Car Wash Guy. Thank you Riley for great customer service.<//review>

SUPER NICE!!! Customer service is EVERYTHING! And my car looked fantastic! He got here at 9am and was here until almost 4! Took his time and got out some REALLY tough stains in my cream colored head liner and my cream colored seats! Thank you so much for working so hard! Would recommend a million times over!</text>

He was straight on what he was selling, he told me he would do his best, have you know inside this SUV, was terrible to top it off my daughter,  put baking soda on the carpet, then sprayed vinegar inside,uh worst smell ever, Riley. Is the man, very good job definitely call him again,

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>Riley, you deserve more than a five star rating. Recently had  a full mobil detail and the quality of of work and how it turned out was fantastic. He explained his services and was very clear of how he would do it. I took the offer of strip wash, nanoskin exfoliation, and sealant, and also protection to the leather upholstery. He took his time making sure all areas were cleaned and sealant applied and very methodical. During this time I spent time asking questions on what he was doing and he would stop and give me a through explanation in detail and showed patience. Great price and will have him back to detail my wife's car.</Review>< pics>

I am often driving through the mountains and he was able to clean all the tree sap and bug guts off my car. My car looked like it was brand new! He cleaned my interior and it looks amazing.

Riley is an outstanding young man who is a true entrepreneur! If your looking for a good mobile detailer look no further Riley is the guy! He just washed my 3 place trailer and Jet skis which were filthy! He took his time and charged a fair price for the time it took him. I will be using Riley for everytime I need it!

So this guy did an awesome service. He was here for 3 plus hours. He is a young guy and I was sceptical but this guy knew what he was doing. My car looks like a showroom vehicle plus he got the smoke smell out of my car. I had to tip him. Thanks again man! You will be my detailer for now on.<//review>

Best car wash in north  county ! Great car wash does an amazing job cleaning your car.  They also have super powerful vacuums. The facility is very Clean as well. I love that they have clean damp rags for you to use for free.  Giovanni gave me excellent customer service!  It’s 30 minutes from my house but worth the drive.</Review>

<review>I really enjoyed this experience. The wash was really good and the employees are nice. The place is well kept. They're really going to push the membership on you, but nothing that makes you uncomfortable - they just mention it a lot. They have strong vacuums, strong air hoses, and  a lot of towels. The one critique I have is the towels. I'm picky when it comes to the windows and they don't leave the windows streak-free. However that doesn't take away from the entire experience there. I would recommend this car wash place to my friends and family.<//review><Name>James Garcia</Name>< pictures>

<Text>Giovanni was quick to assist and help us figure out what wash was best for our vehicle. This is hands down the best car wash in San diego. Plenty of open vacuums, and a top of the line wash.

I purchased the special $5 deal and was upgraded. I really like the customer service, especially Giovanni!! I went to the San Marcos location and I was very impressed! The wash cleaned very well and the dryers at the end went from front to back and dried the entire car! They also offer free vacuums and an air spray to get the hard to clean place! You’re also given an air freshener and a disposable interior wet nap. Good deal!<//text>

Ahh this replaced the ole hand car wash about a year and change ago. What an upgrade! If you've been to the one in esco you will dig this one too. Huge amount of vacuum bays and 3 entryway ways into car wash tunnel.  I did the sub and for 29 bones I get unlimited wax washes every month. In and out no problem.  You don't even need a sticker the gate recognizes your license plate and you don't have to push,enter or talk to anyone to get your car wash. Highly recommend this place and you get a free air freshener and dash wipe every visit.  Better than soapy Joe's 🧼<//text>

Giovanni at the San Marcos car wash location was super helpful! He didn’t push me into getting the membership instead he told me the details of each wash and it’s benefits. And I will be returning because I was satisfied with my wash (: He was helpful and very kind! We have the same car too!! I love this new location!< /text>

<review>The wash itself was fine. The three stars are for the experience I had with an employee. It was my first visit and I was only interested in one wash, to just try it out. They had someone posted at the entrance kiosk, where you pay for the wash, who immediately started with the hard sell of their monthly multiple package deals. The more I said “no thank you”, the more he came back with all the aggressiveness and pushiness of a car salesman trying to close a deal. It ended with him implying that I was a fool for declining to buy a monthly package. It left a bad enough impression that it’s less-likely that I will return.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

I received a free car wash coupon in the mail and decided to go check them out, despite it being out of my way. The staff were friendly and scanned the coupon with zero questions, I was on my way to the wash. There was some issue with getting the car's wheels on the rails at first but finally it took me in for the wash. The car wasn't washed correctly because the large truck wheels slipped a few times and timing got screwed up or something. The manager at the time (im so sorry forgot your name, Giovanni??) noticed this and apologized before I even had a chance to notice it myself. He told me to drive around to the wash again and personally made sure I got on the rails correctly and the wash started as it should. I pulled into their vacuum bays and wiped down the missed spots. Their towels were clean and did a fantastic job. I am very happy and would come here again. Thanks<//text>

< Review>
Got sold on a monthly membership, (my fault for trying to get a discounted car wash and end up paying more cause I didn’t use it the whole first month!). But the wash was excellent and the vacuums sucked really good! Lol. Meaning they work very well and they have air blower things that my kids enjoy blasting in each other’s faces.  Solid car wash spot.  Soapy Joe’s, you got some competition in town!< /Review>

Just dropped the Soapy Joe's in favor of Superstar Car Wash. Same principle but they seem to have an adequate number of stalls for their customers, at least at this point. Monthly Plans are a little more expensive than Soapy Joe's but maybe that will help keep the stalls open.  LOVE The fact that I have compressed air. Soapy Joe's did away with that pretty quickly.< /Review>

<username>Markus Stampfli< /username><text>They are new and some practices need to be perfected. Still, the new concept is good, quick and effective.

update!!
Without my knowledge I was signed up for the unlimited car wash program and billed every month till I recognized the charges. Early on when I came in they offered a discount and the pitch was that I could come in for a month for free. Great deal, till you realize its a continuing charge. No way!!  Stop it!!<//text></record>

<Text>The air dryer is extremely powerful. The spinning brushes are still new so the sound like they are beating the dirt off your car. I went when they were running the grand opening so my wash was free. Definitely opt for the monthly package and unlimited washes for a better value. I still prefer Soapy Joe's, which is where I have my membership.< /Text>< rate>

Per their "general manager policy" you can listen only music they play, and you you turn your music on in the car and make it a little bit louder than normal, since it's really noisy around, they will make an employee to come out and tell you to turn it off🤦. I'm not even saying that car came out dirty after most expensive wash. At least it was for free, since they mailed me a coupon. Won't come back.

Stopped by here to get gas and use the restroom. Walked into the restroom and OMG, it was super clean. It smelled good! Nicely decorated. Love going into a clean restroom. I wish all gas station restrooms looked like this. Good job Viviana! 👍< /Review>

Asked for cash back, she said 20 dollar max . I said okay . She gave me 20 cash and charged me 40.  Now I can't get food today.  No one will pick up the phone to resolve the issue.< /Review>

Son's haircut nit fully done. Only fade and edge. Unable to cut top of hair with clippers, so used scissors instead. No shape, no style. Unsatisfied, will not be going back.<//review>

Perfect haircut that I haven’t received with another barber shop I went to years ago. Precisely what I asked for. Moses was very kind and professional with the work. Will go back again.</Review>

They all know how to cut hair and they are good at it.<//Review>

I made the mistake of not going to this barbershop for my cut. I honestly thought that no-one could fix the horrible haircut I had from earlier in the day by a different barbershop. They saved the day just in time for the holidays. Awesome haircuts all the time. Thanks.< /text>

<Text>Was here yesterday for the first time. Gabe was my barber. Awesome!! Told him how I liked my hair in the beginning and had to tell him nothing else. He turned me around to see his work in the mirror and I was very pleased with what he did. Needless to say I will be back on a regular basis. Thanks Gabe!!< /Text>< Resp>

<review>Took my grandson in for an 1130 appt, and we hadn't even made it through the door, when I head "Are you Dominic? He said yes, guy said, were ready for you, he sat with Ivan who was ready to go"!
I thought that was awesome!!
Super friendly, and definitely worth paying a lil extra for specifics (to a tee) .</review>< pics>

The waits can be long but they take their time and do a great job. I haven't had a bad cut yet and I think I've been cut by everyone except one that I know of. Unless you're lucky or make an appointment you probably shouldn't come here if you're pressed for time.< /Review>

<review>My experience:
When I arrived at the store, I was acknowledged and was asked to wait and was informed someone will be with me shortly. After waiting may be 1-2 minutes, employee marked number 1 in the picture below started helping me.

I gave employee 1 my iPhone 12 pro max and asked him to replace screen protector. He grabbed one screen protector, rang me up for $0(covered under insurance) and took around 7 min from grabbing the screen protector to ringing me up.

He then takes his time to apply screen protector and switched off my iPhone without even asking me. I arrived at 11:40am, now it is 12 noon and he's finally done. I then find out screen protector is way smaller and it doesn't cover the entire screen, he insisted it's the correct size. I then looked at the invoice and he was trying to give me screen protector for iPhone 11 pro max, which is smaller because of its smaller screen size(6.5" and 6.7" of 12pro). I told him one more time this not the correct size.

He then looks up in his system and goes, well in the system there are 3 (including the ones I had on my previous phones) and we always look at the top one. He then turned around the screen and showed me what he was talking about. My iPhone 12 pro max was listed right there with history of purchases. He then tells me they don't have the right screen protector for my iphone 12 pro max and they will refer me to another store close by.

I was really tight on time and at this point I have been in the store for 25min already.

I informed employee 1 that I am really not happy about this, he should have checked availability before replacing the screen protector.

This employee response is what left me in shock, he said: "well ok don't worry about it, it happens" and I said excuse me? What do you mean? Didn't you check my phone before applying screen guard? I told you it's an iPhone 12 pro max. All I was expecting was an apology as I am a customer and they wasted my time, that's the least to expect.

This employee 1 then added" well we know we are wrong here, so what? Big deal, we all make mistakes, it's ok". After hearing this, I then referred to employee 2 who is the manager of the store and she was even worse.

She said well when customer bring in their phone, the staff looks at the whatever shows up at the top in their system and install that screen guard only.

I asked her one simple question which she couldn't give a satisfactory answer to: "When I gave you iPhone 12 pro max, why did your employee applied iPhone 11 pro max's screen guard and tried to give it to me? Don't you know it's not iPhone 11? " she said it's customer's responsibility to let them know which screen guard they want. That sounded so retarded and made absolutely no sense. If I give them a samsung will they still apply iphone 11 screen guard?

I told the manager, you guys are extremely rude and i am a loyal customer for over a year now and live right behind you guys. If you treat me like this I might have to start going to another store close by and she said well it's ok you can go to another store.

________________________________

When I went to other store with address: 20566 redwood rd, I asked the staff there if I have to tell them to make sure to put iphone 12's screen guard on my iphone 12? The lady over there said well it's obvious, why would they put some other phone's screen guard? I told her what happened at castro valley blvd location and she said they get a lot of customers to their store who visit them after experiencing below par customer service from Castro Valley blvd location.

This lady took 5 min, asked me for permission to switch off my phone, applied the right screen guard and I was on my way

Verdit: Tmobile prides themselves in offering top notch customer service. These incompetent and untrained employees are bad face for a company like Tmobile.

Extremely rude customer service. I really don’t understand how they are in business. Passing comments towards their customers is what their employees excel at. People should really leave their personal problems at home before clocking in for work. They always have a table setup outside their store and their employees keep passing comments which is extremely rude. I did file a complaint with Tmobile corporate</review>

My daughter and I went in today to figure out what was going on with my phone, and I left with a new iphone 12 ! Both sales associates were amazing and friendly as well as informative. I have not had good customer service in a store for a long time so it was really refreshing and felt really good. I will definitely be going to this store if I need any upgrades! I recommend this store to anyone else too for a smooth, easy, stress free experience.<//Review>

They did their jobs well. At times they need a little prompting, so do your research before you come here. They will recall the details if you ask the right questions. Store is clean, nice, and presentable. They are fun conversationalists! However, they lied to me about my phone, DON'T EVER GET A SAMSUNG A6- IAM STILL DEALING WITH THE FALLOUT AT 5HE END OF MAY, AND TO ADD INSULT TO INJURYMY PLAN DOES NOT COST APPROX 90 BUCKS, TRY 158 PER MONTH. Terrible. I won't do TMobile again, ever again, EVER! DID I SAY EVER? 8 meant never!!!<//Text>

Convenient location and service options are competitive for the market but the explanation I received wasn't clear the reps weren't making eye contact. My sense was dishonesty and I had to call into corporate to straighten things out.< /Review>

<review>This T-mobile location is by far the best! I absolutely LOVE Kim the manager who I have dealt with on numerous occasions. I went in to get a new phone and between Sara and Kim it was one of the best experiences I have had. Mind you I hate going into cell phone places, its like buying a car your there forever and confused when you leave BUT not with sara and kim they explained everything in detail and even wrote it down so I can visually see it. Thanks Sara and kim your awesome and deserve a promotion!<//review></record></dataset><record>

<user_id>104442587541005843326< /user_id>< Review>
I went there to ask for an unlimited data plan and an unlimited hotspot speed for 1 month for a prepaid sim. They made me pay 64$ for a plan that gave me only unlimited data without telling me that the hotspot will have a 2g speed.

When I came back to ask for assistance they told me that this is the plan and that for an extra 40$ they could fix my problem which they created although I have mentioned explicitly my needs.

Very weak customer service. Shame on T Mobile for such a bad customer experience.< /Review>

<review>Awesome experience! I was super tired of paying for so much and getting so little with my previous carrier. Went it with a mission and left with a really great experience. Devante helped with every question I had, explained everything to me and had a great attitude. Everyone in that store is super friendly and knowledgeable.

I was extremely impressed with the two young ladies that assisted me. I had an unusual situation and I was looking for an inexpensive solution. Jessica, the Manager, and Tia, one of the employees, went above and beyond to find me the packaged I needed within my budget.  I gave Jessica a number and she had me out the door and the upfront cost was within $5.00 of the number I gave her. Not only did she get me out the door with a low upfront cost, she got me a great monthly rate with all the bells and whistles, all within my budget constraints. If I could give this location, and specifically the manager and employees, more than 5 stars, I absolutely would. The customer service I received at this T-Mobile location is a huge reason I have stayed a T-Mobile customer for over 2 years. Thanks again to Jessica and Tia !!!!<//text>

I came in 10 minutes before closing after a frustrating day at the T mobile in Dublin and Kim was able to take care of me ! She went out of her way staying after hours to get all of my things transferred and also told me that she could help me save money on my plan. I left more then happy with a new phone free tablet and a cheaper phone bill ! Definitely will be coming back. Go kim!< /Review>< Pics>

<Review>I had an abundance of different issues with 5 lines and all kinds of other things that needed fixing. Although very friendly, the customer care hotline was never able to fix my issues, but the great team of Jess and Kim listened to me complain and my baby cry while spending hours in the store and ended up fixing all my (t-mobile-related) problems.
I am so happy this store is back open here in Castro Valley and I will always come back here with my usually very little) issues.
Thank you thank you thank you Csatro Valley branch, especially Jess and Kim! You guys rock!!!</Review></record></dataset><record>

was on my way to starbucks seen that it was a T-mobile stopped in this girl Kim was there she was so helpful answered all my questions about their service. I end up switching to tmobile from at&t. While Kim was helping setup my new phone my baby was running around and the guy who works there dont know his name just know he was bald he offered my son a cookie and water. Ive never had customer service so great before I will be back for sure real soon. Love the energy at the store wonderful staff. Thanks for all the great service!!!!</review>

First time we have had Chinese food since we visited the area. It was recommended by some locals so we thought we would try it out. The portions were plentiful as we expect eating Chinese food. Service was questionable,  the server did not speak English, he would walk away while we were speaking. The meals were brought to the table in no such order. No rhyme or reason.  The biggest issue I had was a staff employee was making an appetizer at a dining room table, no gloves on, nothing on the dining room table. She had a package of thin pastry,  some vegetable content and then rolling on the dining table, she had NOT cleaned.  Unacceptable food handling standards. Won't be back</Text>

Good sized menu and no long wait for your food. Best Chinese food in the area,  and reasonably priced.Restaurant is kept clean and the owner, Mary is so friendly.

Actually some of the worst food I’ve ever eaten, I had a bad flu and finally regained my appetite and was excited to eat. That all changed after dining at this establishment. Don’t get me wrong the staff was nice, and gave good service, however the food was the opposite. The dining area also had an unsettling smell (possibly from the food itself). I was and still am in disbelief of the food that was served to my friend and I sincerely hope my experience was anomalous, however I feel some responsibility to save others from feeling the same dissatisfaction I felt after dining here.</Review>

It is a very "local place".  Very low on atmosphere, very high on the food (in terms of flavor, portions, and price).  Mary (the proprietor) remembers everyone and treats everyone like family.  She works people, with substitutions and flavors they like, to get them just the right meal.<//text>

<text>Great Chinese food and Mary, the owner, makes you feel at home. I call it "Custom Chinese food" she always asks what kind of veggies, sauce, etc. you can build your perfect dish! And she will even remember what that was next time you come in. Service like this doesn't exist anyplace else. Of all the Chinese places in Scotts Valley this is the only one I eat at.</text><Rate>5</Rate>< Time>

< Review>
Gluten-Free Chinese! Oh the joy! The staff and especially the chef understand the intricacies of cooking for celiacs! Bring your own no-wheat soy sauce, and enjoy (gluten-free) Chinese again. The other night, the chef came out multiple times to double-check that various ingredients in our order were OK, and suggested safe substitutions: bliss.
Vegetables still crispy (not overcooked), sauces and seasonings tasty, and prices are quite reasonable. We always leave with a smile and multiple boxes of the abundant portions we couldn't finish, which reheat for future meals nicely. Love it.< /Review>

<text>The Chinese restaurant I found in Scotts Valley next to the movie theater was very
nice. The staff greeted me as if I was a member of the family. They are incredibly
prompt and efficient. I had a war wonton soup and potstickers and I liked it all. The war wonton soup came out so fast that I don't think the fast food place could have made it any quicker and it was a wonderful mixture with everything in it shrimp, chicken, beef, broccoli, water chestnuts, bamboo shoots, carrots, and more, and boiling hot. The hardest thing is to be patient while it cools a little bit so I don't fry my taste buds prior to needing them to taste all these flavors. The pot stickers came out pretty good. I'd like to try more things on the menu.

Now when I mention that the staff was so nice I watched this lady handle the table

that came in after me, while I was patiently waiting for my food and the way she

handled them so promptly, so politely, and so helpful, well it was impressive. She

wastaking care of them so then even if it said no substitutions she would change

things to make sure they were happy, like I said impressive. If I come again or

maybe I should say when I return I will be trying some other things on this menu

but that will be another visit.< /text>< Response>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>Hands Down, the best soil mix for ALL plants. Literally everything from Banana Trees, Mango, Lemon and Lime Trees, Avocado to Dahlia's, Orange Birds of Paradise, Orchids, Rose's. Literally everything loves this soil mix. O' and of course Purple Sticky Sponge. Big Roots is pot and/or ground ready, no amendments needed. Recommend for any and all grow operations!</review>< pictures>

<Text>Just bought 45 bags of big roots. Got to talk with soil king about some golden arm style hoop house stuff. Beyond stoked to meet a Influential and nice fellow grower. Beyond helpful. Knowledgeable. And if you follow their instagram and fb it's just really nice to be able to go to a local who cares and knows.<//Text><pics>None</pics><user_name>Jay “MrNiceGuy420” Sun<//user_name>< Response>

Ordered soil amendments for our raised bed planters outside. I have seen the company from watching their gardens grow, videos and what nots. Seem like they’re knowledgeable in what works and what plan doesn’t. Know and trust my green thumb so I can trust they won’t give you anything but the best of what nature has to offer. Made by farmers for the farmers! So if you lookin for the BIG ROOTZ? I’d check out The King of the Soil!! 🤘🏼<//Text>

< Review>
I bought their overpriced organic soil (almost 3x as expensive as grab n grow), was told the soil was so amazing I couldn’t mix it with anything else for 3 weeks.  My beds with grab n grow soil are thriving, tomatoes are huge, the beds with soil king are not.  The plants are small, not holding flower,  the soil is full of vermiculite and doesn’t hold water.   Highly disappointed considering the crazy price they charge for their soils.<//Review>

First time customer. Drove for over 30 minutes. Store is closed despite the very clear hours posted on the website. Employee walks out and after explaining that being closed on Saturday is nothing new he carelessly mutters “ah man that’s too bad” and then walks way. Will not return and pretty glad I didn’t spend my money here anyways.</Review>

Some of the best soil you can buy...this is close to what I would put in my soil if I was building it from scratch...they are knowledgable and usually pretty busy. I hope that we can have a long and prosperous relationship because their soil is high quality!< /review>

Search place has a very nice outdoor patio right in front of the main entryway.  The food, service and outdoor ambiance all contribute to a very nice experience. And it doesn't hurt that the prices are reasonable. All in all this is an excellent value and a great experience for dining during the covert 19 restrictions.<//Text>

<Review>Horrible food. At first the fact that they did not have potatoes (as a steak side) should have warned us. We ordered a medium/rare ribeye that came out well-done. The pasta and the sauce looked liked it was from a costco can. Do not believe the 4.4 star rating.< /Review><name>ehsan hosseini</name>< rating>

Once upon a time, Terra Mia was my favorite Italian restaurant in Livermore. Oh, what changed??
I have been disappointed the last three times that I have eaten there.
I ordered veal piccata but chicken piccata arrived at my table. My waiter, David, was wonderful. He insisted on sending it back. Then came something that was much like a tasteless piece of leather and very tough. It was served next to polenta which was cold, absolutely tasteless, and with a muddy consistency. The broccoli and veggies were mush. I was thankful to have bread with olive oil and balsamic because that was my dinner.< /Text>

<userid>112279568049511296279</userid><Name>M Wong</Name><text>Excellent food and service.  The restaurant is decorated very well.  There is an outdoor patio for outdoor seating as well as indoor seating.  There is also a private room for larger events.  They start off with a bread basket.  There is balsamic vinegar and olive oil on the table to self-serve.  The balsamic vinegar is very tasty.  Their calamari was woofed down by everyone in 2 seconds flat. The lasagna is really done well.. not too acidic.  The fettuccine with Bolognese was excellent.  The portion of the tortellini with ham and tomato cream sauce was too small.  The pizza was yummy.  However,  I have had better elsewhere. Our water was constantly filled.   Our used dishes were  seldom left long at the table.  The servers exchanged our dirty dishes for new dishes numerous times.  We would definitely come back again for the delicious food and service.<//text><Date>1502447388473<//Date>< rating>

Delicious! Recommend the gnocchi gorgonzola ... I had no idea gnocchi could be so soft! You can taste the potato in them too, and the gorgonzola sauce is just amazing. The garlic bread is delicious too, and they have a very nice ginger beer for non-alcoholic lovers. Will need to come back to try something new!!

Tried the tortellini ala crema - delicious!! It's not often I find somewhere that does meat-filled pasta, and this does not disappoint. The sauce is wonderfully flavorful too! Also recommend the prosciutto and melon - very tasty and refreshing! Excellent as an appetizer, would definitely get again.</text>

This is a review for two experiences. One visit was dining in and the security and was for take-out.

Dining in we went to the restaurant in a group of 5. Our server was excellent and answered many menu related questions from our group. The food was delicious, fresh, and just the right serving size. We shared two different salads and each ordered a pasta entree. Everyone was pleased with the food. They also had a good tap list to choose from with some unique offerings.

The take-out experience was during the county's shelter in place. The pizza we had was perfect to share for 2-3 people. I tried the veggie pizza and look forward to trying some of their other toppings soon.<//review>

Even in chinavirus times,  terra mia has the best Italian food in Livermore.
Great wine selection,  awesome menu, even better staff, especially the poor overwhelmed bus boy/table assistant...thanks dude, for the hard work.
I love everything about TM but for now,  i will stand with the Gnocchi Gorgonzola and the Pollo Saltimboca as their best offerings.  Never fails to satisfy every taste bud.</review>

Great food with great service. I went in on a Friday night and it was pretty busy but the wait for the food was not that long. Blood orange margarita was good.<//Review>

Lasagana and margherita pizza. Both were very good. Crust on the pizza especially good, but a little over-done in some spots. Lasagana was good, but the pasta to cheese ratio was a little short. It tasted tomatie to my girlfriend. I liked the meatiness of it, though it could be gussied up a bit. I think it's traditional with good ingredients and fresh parm to top you're entre. Calamari app was excellent.< /review>

<text>Great food but noise level is just too high there. Acoustics are terrible. Fellow diners were not exceptionally loud but the terrible acoustics made it seem as if they were. Food however was very tasty, large portions, very good service. Even without a reservation we were seated immediately. If noise isn't an issue then I highly recommend.< /text><resp>None</resp>< Date>

< Review>
Nice Italian restaurant in a small plaza in Livermore. Close to wine country, this restaurant has good food, a nice atmosphere and decent service. On my most recent visit, a busy Saturday night, the service was a little slow, but it just allowed is to enjoy our drinks more.<//Review>

< review>
First time going to this restaurant, I ordered Take out and lots of it and tipped 20%.  They didn’t put my Teramasu desert in the bag.  I called and asked why they didn’t.  The guy on the phone stated he forgot and that it’s not on my receipt.  I tipped him 3 times the price of the Teramasu and maybe I should have asked to get my tip back as he is rude and horrible customer service.  The food is so so.< /review>

We had a group of around 25 in a very nice private buffet room for up to 50 people.  The room was quiet with the doors closed and was right next to the bar. Some folks arrived late, after we had moved on to other courses but the staff brought out more of the food for them. The servers Paco and Giaccomo, and the busser Maggie, were all fantastic. Jiovanie the bartender makes a  great Manhattan and I understand does good with the other drinks also. The food was absolutely fantastic. The person who organized it for us this year also mentioned that they were much easier to arrange it with than places we have had previous events. This is where we will go again next year.<//review>

Best Italian restaurant in the Livermore area.  Great atmosphere and great dinner service.  Everyone in our party of ten raved about their meal - from Pizza to Filet Mignon.  Full bar and good wine list.</text>

Excellent food and service! My husband had the steak, I had the gnocchi gorgonzola which was melt in your mouth delicious.  We shared the wonderful mascarpone mousse, which was light and fluffy.
Great service by Dave, thank you for the great recommendations! We have found our new favorite Italian restaurant!<//Text>

This hidden gem used to be the diamond in the rough. But after recent changes, it no longer shines bright. The food is still good, but the smaller menu, MUCH smaller portions and escalating prices, I find it harder to enjoy what was once our favorite restaurant in the Bay Area. Perhaps we will still make it over there occasionally, but this place has fallen from where it once stood: at the top<//review>

<Review>You can always expect to get an amazing meal at Terra Mia. The food selection is very nice and the service is usually very good. On one or two occasions, the food took extremely long to arrive, but it is a rare case for that to happen. I don't drink wine, but I see lots of people bringing their favorite bottle with them. I'm not sure if that means their wine selection is not so good or highly marked up, but it is nice that they offer the flexibility.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

My sister lives in Livermore, and I travel from Gilroy to go to Terre Mia's with her. It's an annual event for us and we always order the same thing: a glass of Prosecco, Carbonara, and we share a Spumoni for dessert. The Carbonara is wonderful and very authentic--not saucy at all. It's on the "dry" side but so flavorful with pancetta.  Delicious!  The Spumoni finishes the meal off nicely.<//Review>

<review>This is a really excellent Italian restaurant that I ate at last night. We started with bruschetta and the tomatoes were fresh and served on crisp garlic bread. Followed with the chicken saltimbocca which was delicious. No room for dessert but lots of good selections available. We ate early (5pm on a Sunday) and the place was already filling up so reservations are strongly recommended. Service was friendly and quick. Strongly recommend this place!< /review><user_name>Mark Perez< /user_name></record>

<text>They have really good food, a large menu with a lot of options to choose from. The food is delicious but the service needs a lot of work. We waited for 20 minutes for our meal which is fine but it came out cold. They were apologetic and replaced it for us.< /text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<text>Beautiful place.  Food was good but did not stand out for me,  nothing to complain about,  just regular Italian  fare.  Maybe I just didn't order the right dish,  or maybe I just have been to so many excellent Italian restaurants in the city and also in Italy that it's hard to be impressed. The service was excellent. I will not hesitate to come back..... Maybe next time I could try something else and edit my review.</text>< user_id>

<Text>Ordered an expensive veal dish to go as we were too exhausted to eat there.  The meal was ready on time and the meat and veggies were perfect.  The potatoes were wet, mushy and really tasted like reheats from the day before.  They actually had a refrigerator taste. I called and brought them back on principle given the cost of the meal.  The owner agreed they were awful and he said he would send me home with a box of properly prepared ones in 5 to 10 minutes at the longest.  45 minutes I was still waiting.  Finally my husband, who was waiting in the car, came in, and we were given a box of potatoes that were somewhat better than the first.  I could have made them from scratch in the time we waited.  The owner does not have any principles. Period.<//Text><Resp>None<//Resp><name>Arlynn Grimm< /name><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Rate>

I've only gone the one time and there were 5 of us in our party and we each got different entrees and we were all very pleased.  The ambiance of this restaurant is also quite nice. It would be a great place to go on a date too as it's quite romantic feeling as well.</text><resp>None</resp>< Date>

<username>Helen Stimson< /username><review>Dinner at 5PM for 4 adults + 2 kids.
THEY would not split a house salad..charged for 2 small salads, more than we each wanted...and it cost more. Service (@ 5PM mind you was very slow.) Children's menu, about a cup of Penne Pasta with butter $9 DOLLARS, can you believe??? Adult meals were OK, not great, and mine was lukewarm. One child had a Birthday, we were asked what  he'd  like for dessert...then they charged for it. 2 salads, Entrees and 1 dessert....took until 640pm with a 5PM Reservation😦😥<//review><UserId.>106610001425464103936<//UserId.><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<Text>Good food and great homey character. This is a nice place that is just down the street. Everyone should be so lucky to have an authentic neighborhood Italian restaurant. Nice drinks, friendly service, really good food. Raspberry panna cotta plus Bigné Terra Cotta and 10 year Presidential port, really nice evening. Thanks Terra Mia.

If you are in Livermore, you have to go to Terra Mia Italian. The service and food are best in Bay Area ( my opinion).
I highly recommend it! I never have a bad experience at Terra Mia, 4040 East Ave, Livermore, CA 94550< /Review>

What a lovely dinner we had. The salads were not the best, but were fine. The gnocchi with gorgonzola (two in our party ordered it) was a hit, despite the fact it could have been a little sharper. The bolognese, the pizza, and the prima vera were good. What brings my rating to five stars was the impeccable service. The service perfectly walked that fine line between attentive and intrusive. The youngest in our party was being a bit petulant and was the recipient of a little extra attention and it was just right. We will be returning soon.< /text>

Overall I was disappointed from the meal. The restaurant had poor acoustics and was very loud. The salad was watery and my clam pasta was bland. I spent over twenty dollars for buttered noodles and a handful of clams and I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone who respects Italian food.<//text>

<Review>Used to be much better.  The Seabass special was just ok.  The pasta dishes still seem decent.  Very noisy on a Saturday night. Prices are creeping up to more than I'd expect for a neighborhood place.  Decent wine list with numerous Italian whites and reds.

<text>Old school-style Italian place, nice outdoor seating but kinda dark inside, lots of room. The salmon ziti was very good as was the house salad. Good wait service, without that pestering "is everything ok" as they rush by after you've just taken one bite. Very good decaf coffee, which is kinda hard to find. Sensible pricing.< /text>< pics>

Great Italian place in a random strip mall. We had a 20 person birthday here and the service was quick and courteous. I had the lasagna and it was meaty, pasta goodness. Got some typical apps like calamari and bruschetta. Both were great.  I would definitely suggest this to anyone looking for a nice but not overly fancy Italian place with an emphasis on good food at reasonable prices.< /text>

Sadly, this place has decent reviews, but my wife and I had a horrible experience with the food. Started off with being told to sit anywhere we wanted on the patio, so we did. Two tables who were sat after us we greeted and given menus and a waiter, but 10 minutes later...we still hadn't been acknowledged so I went and told the host. 5 min after that, we were greeted. I asked the waiters recommendation on a bottle of Rose...he recommended the most expensive, but had no tasting notes to go with his rec. I asked if they had Linguini and clams. The waiter told me "no....this is not italian authentic, so we don't have that".  What a lie.  My wife ordered the fetcuini al salmon and I ordered a pesto pasta with salmon on top. We also ordered a calamari fritti to start.  Calamari came out and was soft and chewy.....no crisp at all. I sent it back telling them why. They brought it back 5 min later and they had dumped the calamari back in the oil and killed it. Now it was crispy, chewy grossness. We set it aside, not eating it. Then the pastas came....  Both were horrible. My wife pasta was under al dente, and mine was overcooked....but they were the same noodle. The Salmon was diced into small pieces and incorporated into the dish rather than a nice fillet on top. Salmon was horrible....overcooked beyond done! It tasted and smelled horrible.
After telling the waiter, the manager came over and i very very kindly explained how bad our meal was, pointing out exactly why wit the salmon and the calamari. Then our bill came. They removed my entree, but still charged me for my wife's horrible entree and the sad calamari. The only thing worth paying for was the wine. So in the end, I paid out $90.00 ($40.00 for the wine & $15.00 tip) and left hungry and annoyed. Stopped at in-n-out on the way home, which was 100 times better that Terra Mia. If you like real Italian food, stay far away from this place...NEVER AGAIN!!</Text>

I feel like this place is one of the better places to go to for Italian food in Livermore. Their food is always good here and they make their own pasta here too! You can literally taste the difference! Everything else is also very fresh on the menu and I love their garden salad. It's super crisp and I love the beet on the top of the salad. The service is also very good and they are very attentive but also let you take your time. They never try to rush you when you are here and make you feel like you can stay as long as you want which is great. Definitely make this your place to go if you are in the area. They also carry a bunch local wines such as Wente and Concannon which is nice also!</review>

Making a reservation apparently does not mean anything to this restaurant, Other customers with no reservation who got there after my date and I, got seated before us. Maybe its because Im in my early 20's and Im not a priority in their eyes... who knows. Once I was seated I felt unwelcome by the waiter, every time we spoke he gave me a sarcastic sympathetic tone of voice. Worst part was when I wanted to order a beverage with alcohol , the waiter gave me such an sarcastic apologetic tone thinking that i was not of age and Instead he suggested I get a soda... Like seriously ? Once my date and I got our drinks and dinner, it was just disappointing and lacking flavor. when it was time to pay the waiter gave me a look as if I could not afford to be there. It was just such a unpleasant experience, and felt extremely unwelcome. This is the only place I have ever written a review for. I think I'll stay with my usually spot in SF where they actually treat you right, and not talk down to you.< /Text>

<Review>Had dinner at Terra Mia Friday night.  Very disappointed.  Spaghetti Aglio was dry... pasta was stuck together. Three olives in my pasta.  Have patronized this place for years but quality has slowly declined. Best part of the meal... Altamont Beer.   Not likely to give them another chance.< /Review>< pics>

Had a very similar experience to GHOS7v, I too am in my young 20's and I too felt like my date and I were looked down upon. When we first arrived we got absolutely no greeting for at least 5 mins, while they were busy I've never been too a place were I never been greeted. While their food was lacking in favor, their gnocchi is great. I have given this place a try 2 or 3 times after that experience, due to the fact this is the most decent Italian  food in our area. Our experiences after our first was no where near as bad, but we have learned to stick with the gnocchi and go when it's not their busiest times, like on a Monday night.<//text>

<review>We held our wedding reception at Terra Mia and are really glad we did! From early on, the co-owners were extremely helpful and accommodating, particularly Daniele. On the day of, we were swamped with wedding related activities, and the owners and wait staff made sure things ran smoothly with table arrangements, decorations, etc while we were absent. During service, wait staff were fantastically smooth and efficient, never in the way, but always available if we needed anything. The manager was able to quickly put together an alternative meal when it turned out one guest couldn't eat something (gorgonzola in the gnocchi). And the food was top-to-bottom great. We had the banquet options of caprese, garlic bread, osobucco, gnocchi, finished with tiramisu. All were delicious and and we heard only compliments from the guests (3/4 of whom were asian and wouldn't mind telling us if anything was wrong!). Wine and cocktail selection was excellent as well. All-in-all, Terra Mia, its owners, and its staff made our wedding reception as high quality as we could have asked, our guests happy, and us able to enjoy the evening with minimal stress. My only regret from the evening is that my brain was so fried with everything else that I think I forgot to tip as much as I wanted. I'll make it up though, next time I'm in the area as I'm sure we'll be coming back!<//review>< Rate>

<text>Invisible Armour is located at the Main Marketplace in Santa Ana. I have utilized their services 2 times already and all I have to say is that this is a great establishment for buying, selling or repairing your cellphone device. The staff is very friendly and helpful with any questions you may have. Not only you may find cellphones,  they also have a wide variety of tablets, smartwatches and other electronic devices. You can bring your device for repair or trade it in for another one offsetting the value of your device. The used cellphones quality is optimal. I cannot tell they are used phones and are in prime quality. You can also sell your device as well. One interesting thing I saw is that they have very rare and old cellphone devices. So if you are looking into any brand they most likely have it or they will call you when they find it! I recommend Invisible Armor to anyone looking to buy, sell or repair their cellphone, tablet!!!</text><time>1618786589397< /time>< UserId.>

The staff here is amazing. I went to the Main Place location over a year ago when my old iPhone was having charging issues. Not only did they set me up with a new  (well, used) iPhone, but they also transferred all the data from my old iPhone. It was a challenge since the cable port was broken, but they were dedicated and got the job done! I’ll be coming back here soon to upgrade. Can’t wait.</text>

< Review>
I come to invisible armor for all my repairs and always have top notch results in a short period of time. Alfonso and Janet are so down to earth and always attend me with professionalism,  that’s why i never bother to pay or drive up to the OC from Downey anytime i need a repair. Extremely recommended!<//Review>

< Review>
My Note 10+ charging port got wet and stopped taking a charge. After going to Best Buy and hearing one of the workers recommend this place, I decided to go and check it out. They were timely and they own up to their warranty (through no fault of their own, the brand new part that they had installed at first and that I paid for had issues, they replaced it without any extra charges and also reimbursed me for another extra speaker I had bought because at first we all thought that was the real issue). Alfonso, Daniel and Jorge were all truly nice and courteous with me. Service was quick, efficient and honestly one of my to-go places to either get your phone fixed or buy a used phone for a reasonable price.< /Review>

Esteban did a great job replacing the battery of my good old Galaxy Note 5 for a reasonable price. I tried to do it myself at first but I failed miserably because it's not as easy as it looks. Thanks to the expertise of Invisible Armor Repair, I had my phone ready in a couple of hours as promised after I brought my phone and my own new battery. My smartphone has a new life now! I definitely recommend their service.< /text>

I took my phone for a screen replacement and the mic wouldn’t work properly afterward. I didn’t relate this mic issue to the screen replacement at first, but after doing some research I found out it happens frequently, so I went back to the shop. I was received with a lot of attitude, the white guy behind the counter wouldn’t believe me and immediately began opening Apps and messing with the phone without even telling me he needed to do that. They opened the phone back up, made me reinstall apps and do a soft reset, all without any success. Not only they couldn’t solve the issue, but after my second visit to this shop, I’m running into more issues with the camera and the phone. If you ask me, these guys don’t know what they are doing. I would avoid this business!<//text>

I was recommended by a friend to stop by this place for iPhone 12 cases.  Me and my wife are really happy with the cases we purchased. Not only did they have a lot of accessories but they also have a cool collection of phones. When I say collection they I mean old school phones like blackberry, Nokia, and the Motorola Brick phone.< /Review>

I needed to have my Samsung A20 screen repaired. I found Invisible Armor. After looking through so many other companies I chose them based on their positive reviews. I would like to share my experience. The process couldn't have been simpler. I called to let them know I was coming and the lady told me that once the part was delivered it would take less than 30 minutes to complete it. Well she did it in 20 minutes & the huge plus was that it was inexpensive too. I’m a happy camper!<//Text>

<text>Dropped my iPhone 11 in the carpet not only the screen broke but couldn’t use the phone. Touch was not working and their where lines going down the middle.  Made an appointment with Best Buy once I get their they said they will need it for 24 hours. I could do it because I needed the phone for work. I called this place and they said they could get it done within 30 min.  Not only they got it done in less than 20 min it was cheaper than Best Buy.< /text>< date>

Took it to this shop they did a quick diagnose and said the charger ic is bad. Some chip inside the phone.  They told me they could have it ready around 6:30.

Ended up getting a used iPhone x in pretty good condition. Wanted to keep it in good condition so I always get a full body wrap. Ended up putting a nice wood skin. I had the wrap on my old iPhone 8 and just loved it.  I am not a big fan on iPhone cases and this is a good way to keep it protected.< /text>

These guys are worth the extra trip I had to made. I needed to unlock my Sprint Samsung note 8 for European carrier. What we all know Sprint is pain to unlock. Any other place gave me headache or unreasonably high price. These guys were fast to respond and had great price for the service provided for me. I went there Saturday and they needed phone for 24 hours, what was fine w me cuz I needed it by Sunday night. Even tho they called Sunday they needed more time and phone will be unlocked by Monday, what just wasnt possible for me, they made it happened! Im so very grateful to them.</Review>

The guy, Rick, he was very helpful! Super knowledgeable and he was very honest with his advice. He didn't want to charge me for a repair on my broken Samsung S6 Edge. Said it was going to cost more than just getting a used one. Saved me at least $150! They even had used phones for sale right there! Friend referred me to them because they've had really great repairs done here but I can't comment on that myself since I didn't get one<//Text>

Broke my iPhone 7 screen and didn't think it was possible to fix. These guys do excellent work and at a fair price.  Also they keep the part in stock and I was in and out in less than 30 min.

Recently got my note 5 repaired after my son decided to throw it, called around to a lot of shops and couldn't find anyone who repaired them. Luckily I found them in the mall while I was black Friday shopping and Daniel let me know he would be able to finish it while I kept shopping.
He was very helpful even gave me 30% off for a case
That's located in their new store in orange.
Highly recommend these guys for repairs< /text>

I stopped to buy a screen protector, and Brenda was very helpful. She answered all my questions and was very attentive. She did an amazing job putting the screen protector, no air bubbles, which not alot of people take the time to do it perfect.

Fantastic customer service. Ask for Brenda.< /Review>

Found these guy online under "best iPhone repair shop" and they were number 1. True to the reviews these guys are quick and offer multiple prices to fit any budget. My screen repair only took 15 min and throug out the whole time I was able to shop and not sit there just waiting. Great place and honest guys would definitely recommend.<//review>

Great place with friendly staff. Have been coming to invisible armor for 2 years now and anytime I need my note 5 tempered glass replaced, I just come back to these guys and for $10 I get a brand new one. Saves me time and money. Wouldn't think about going anywhere else. Ask for PK he always does a great job.< /review>

I have a Samsung galaxy s7 and the work they did was amazing. great cover and they explained everything to you really well. On how they work to install the screen cover. So anyone looking for a great screen protector come here. And get your phone a screen cover that will do the work to insure your phone's protected. Located in Santa Ana at the main place mall.< /text>

Great service! Friendly staff. Quality work! I could not have had a better experience than when i recently visited their store. The store was spotless and looked better than some of the major retail stores i usually shop at. A++ i highly recommended them to anyone who is looking for accessories, protection, or to fix their smartphone or tablet devices.< /text>

Great company with real good people. I found them on Craigslist and had them unlock my Samsung s8 . Super happy with their response times and their service.  Wasn't in there for more than 10 min they answered all my questions and I felt safe leaving my phone since it would take 24 hrs to be unlocked
Super satisfied customer</text>

I loved the screen protector I got for my iPhone 6, I also got it customized with a skin. They also do repairs here so I'm definitely recommending this to everyone who's got a broken screen. I highly recommend this place and it has good products and has great customer service.
The employee that helped me out the day was so helpful, make sure his name is Jesus he's really great!<//text>

<text>Invisible Armor is the best for screen and mobile repair. I was referred to them by a friend who had nothing but good things to say and I wasn’t disappointed! When I broke my screen I was stressed out that I wouldn’t have my phone for longer than 30 minutes. Well, they got it done in 15-20! It was so fast and looks brand new. I would definitely recommend to get your mobile phone repaired here. Thanks again!<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

<Review>I wanted to sell my old cell phones
Saw that this place had great reviews. Get there was the first one in line then somebody else get there and the guy says I'm gonna help this customers first, then I was like I'm a customer also and he said that I wasn't one because I'm selling stuff to him. Though that was rude so i took my business elsewhere. Didn't get his name but obviously he shouldn't be doing customer service if he's not gonna help the first customer there.<//Review>< pics>

“Fixed” my cracked screen for $50 dollars just for my phone to be gittery& unresponsive the next day.Received minimal help, no refund and was almost convinced it was not their fault. Ha my phone had been great before coming here. Lost money & time. Don’t try to make a profit of of someone who’s sincerely asking for your f***** help, 150 to fix your mistake. Basically what the phones worth today. Take your business up the street<//Text>

This is a great company, Daniel was very polite and helpful. My phone looks perfect and the price to fix a messed up screen is affordable. Definitely will be returning to invisible armor for my next repair.</text>

Took my iPhone6S plus for a cracked screen repair. PK was helpful, matched Apple's price, and the repair was done in less than a half hour. I recommend Invisible Armor! In Main Place, first floor, outside Victoria's Secret.< /Review>

They just put on a screen cover for my iPad Pro.  They did a great job!  This is my second time coming to them as they also put a cover on my iPhone 6 Plus a couple of months ago.  Very helpful and most importantly careful with my toys.  Highly recommend.<//Review>

Got my iPhone 6 screen repaired and battery replaced I was thinking of getting a new phone but the price was too good to let go and decided to get it fixed instead the process was super quick only took 15 minutes and my phone looks brand new out of the box. I'm super satisfied with the work and service and will definitely come back and do all my devices with invisible armor thanks Jesus for helping me out!<//Text>

Me coming here was a great decision. The reason why is because the price was not high at all. They have great deals. My phone was really messed up it was all shattered at a point where my screen blacked out . I brought it here and they fixed my phone really fast. It got in less that 20 minutes. I don't regret coming here at all because my phone looks brand new.</Review>

I was impressed by the way Jesus took care of us. My phone was a mess! it was cracked from bottom to top and I was about to give up and get brand new iPhone. A couple friends mentioned to come by and talk to Jesus and see if he had a solution for it and surprisingly he was able to fix it. I'll highly recommend him and his crew< /review>

I have used the screen protector on two seperate phones. Both phones look as good as the day they were purchased. The customer service is worry free and friendly. Will definitely come back when its time to get a new phone.< /Text>

This is always the store we go to whenever we get our phones done ( screen protectors). They really do a great great job!! the shields last you for a long time and its worth it. The staff are friendly and nice too. Ricardo, The guy who did our iphones 7 & 7 plus really did a good job and he's friendly and very accomodating. And we thank him for the discounts they gave us because we've been their loyal customers for a long long time.. Keep it up guys!!!🙌🏼<//review>

<Date>1528138522936<//Date><Rating>1< /Rating><review>Called this place recently to find out the price to repair “2” IPhone 7+ screens and buy a new battery for an iPhone 7+

Was quoted $120 each phone to fix the screen

$70 for a battery

$310 total

I asked “Why so much for the battery when they sell for $10 on Amazon?”

He replied “Because we have to open the phone.”

I replied “Don’t you open the phone to fix the screen?”

He replied “oh...ya...ok....well only $50 then”

I replied “ok $50, even though they’re only $10 on Amazon?
How much if I bring the battery to you?”

His reply “$30”

So while this store wanted $310 for the whole thing I found a competitor with fair prices and they did it at

$70 for each Iphone 7+ screen repair
$35 for iPhone 7+ battery

$175 total

That’s $135 cheaper for the same service. Do yourself a favor and take 5 min to compare prices with their competitors, it’s worth the 5 min, it saved me $135!!< /review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

The store is brand new and close to 22 freeway and Tustin Street, they repaired my old iPhone 4s with the screen stashed, the cost was razonable and ready for the next day. The manager Alfonso was very nice and let me know other problem that my iPhone has in the power button and give a budget for the repairs.
The parts replaced are very good and I recommend visit to get cases and accessories, they have a good stock for several brands and models.</text>

the service here was great, I came in with two phone. Same type, one with a crack screen and the other with its iOS bricked. The guy took out the motherboard out of the phone with the cracked screen and put it into the phone that was bricked(means that it wouldn't even turn on) and it worked, It was the coolest thing I had ever seen and he explained everything too. Way good service.</text>

<review>I have an Apple Watch. I purchased a screen protector for it I found this kiosk in the mall. They put it in and it looks great. The air bubbles left on the screen will go away in a few hours. It took 10 minutes at least.</review>< pictures>

<date>1501114729396<//date><Text>My daughter's phone cracked and the screen started cracking more and more. I brought it here and they did a fantastic job replacing the screen. In addition they replaced the battery that was inflated and was causing the screen to have pressure marks. I didn't even know that could happen, I'm glad I was able to change the baterry before further damage was caused to the phone. This is my go to place for our cracked phone and IPad screens.</Text>< username>

<review>We came in to have an iPhone 6 screen repaired, it was really cracked and we were helped in under 20 minutes so it was really fast, we were able to walk around the mall and by the time we were done the phone was ready to go and it works great! It was also a reasonable price compared to another kiosk in the mall.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<Text>This place is conveniently located off the 55 freeway in Tustin offers an invaluable service to clumsy individuals that are prone to breaking their smartphones. The staff is knowledgeable, very friendly, and able to repair/protect a large variety of electronic devices. The store itself is very well kept and offered countless types of cases and skin combinations for my Samsung Galaxy S5 and MacBook Pro. They even do custom shields for all types of electronic devices!< /Text>< Pictures>

Javier was very helpful with all the questions I had about the skins and protectors they have.
I ended up getting the glass protector on my phone because I always drop it and I don't want it cracking.< /Review>

Had to get my LCD repaired on my iPhone 7 plus. I didn't think my phone could be repaired but I took it to Daniel and he was very courteous and professional. He told me it would only take half an hour and he was a man of his word. Will be going here with any future needs</Review>

(Translated by Google) If I can give zero points, I don't hesitate. I came here to change the screen of my mobile phone, and the color display of the screen is very different from the original one! Moreover, after they changed the screen, my Home button could not be used normally. They were unable to fix this problem.

(Original)
如果可以给零分的话，我毫不犹豫。我来这儿更换了手机屏幕，结果屏幕的颜色显示和原厂的有很大差异！而且他们居然换了屏幕后导致我的Home键无法正常使用，他们没有能力修复这个问题。<//text>

<Rate>1<//Rate><text>(Translated by Google) These gentlemen are liars, one of them told me that I would change the full screen to my note 5 and q would basically have a new phone for 300 because the screen itself is a piece that gives the images I asked a couple of questions to the q I attended and told me the same thing that would take me a new phone because the connection of the headset does not work well and the connection to load it not at the end just changed the glass front and back and did not know what they did but only work well of the connections a couple of days and today again I can not use headphones. I thought if they would change the whole screen since it is only worth more than 150 in Amazon while only glass costs 20. But not only did they care to make money from a client and that's it.

(Original)
Estos señores son unos mentirosos, uno de ellos me decía q le cambiaria la pantalla completa a mi note 5 y q básicamente tendría un teléfono nuevo por 300 ya q la pantalla en si es una pieza q da las imagenes le hice un par de preguntas al q me atendió y me decía lo mismo q me llevaría un teléfono nuevo debido a q la conexión del audifono no trabaja bien y la conexion para cargarlo tampoco al final sólo le cambiaron el vidrio del frente y atras y no se q le hicieron pero sólo me trabajo bien de las conexiones un par de días y hoy otra vez no puedo usar audifonos. Pensé q si le cambiarían la pantalla completa ya q solo esta vale mas de 150 en amazon mientras q solo el vidrio cuesta 20. Pero no sólo les importó hacer dinero de un cliente y ya.<//text>< pictures>
