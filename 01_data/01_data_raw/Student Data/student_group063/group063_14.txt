Food taste super good. Price are reasonable. Odor inside the restaurant are neutral doesn't smell good nor stink. The restaurant and grocery store are in a same big room divided into two. The restaurant are located close to a big intersection which is Blackstone and Herndon Ave. From a 5 stars review I would rate the restaurant between 4.0-4.7.</text>

The food was unexpected delicious! It's not overly spicy. Whatever you order comes with sides that are included in your meal. The price  of each dish is about $11; which isn't too bad. I loved it there and I'll make sure to come back! Best Korean food I've had in a while!</text>

I went by today because I was looking for Korean food. What I got was amazing! I ordered the Kimchi Soup to go, it is fantastic. There is also a Korean grocery selection to browse. I picked up the big jar of home made Kimchi. I have to say this is great Kimchi, there is also cucumber kimchi that was very tasty! I greatly recommend coming here! The food is amazing and the workers are nice people. I will definitely be coming back and can’t wait until I do!</review>

This is the best Korean food in town. We have been ordering take out during the pandemic and their food is always delicious!! Kimchi stew/tofu soup/bulgogi are our favorites. The lady is very nice and always make sure you are getting everything you need:)</Review>

Enjoyed the ambiance and food soo much. Tried the kimchi tofu soup and a rice dish which was served with these lovely little sides that really were tasty as well. I will absolutely be back, didn't get a chance to get in the market but will next time for sure. It's definitely a sweet cute family feel restaurant.
I should have taken better photos but either way the food was delicious ❤🙌</review>

<Review>Best Korean food in town!! Unlike some Korean places in town, they actually go out of their way and serve you side dishes before your meal arrives. You get full without having to spend a lot of money! Since this is a restaurant/market in one, it has a more casual atmosphere and it feels homey and comfortable. Stop debating if you wanna come here! Go!! It's worth it!</Review><userid>117259156152051513338</userid>< Date>

<Rate>4</Rate><review>Stopped in here for Japchae! (Korean glass noodles) and paid about 10 or 11 dollars for it. The only thing I didn’t like was that there wasn’t any wood ear mushrooms in the noodles! It tasted good and I got a whole bunch of sides with it. I didn’t get a chance to try the other foods, but the owners are really nice and customer service friendly. This market is pretty small and offers everything Korean groceries, but again a small selection. I would come back and probably update this review when I purchase more meals<//review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNxP8HDXnggjlVS_9JEQpGqGEuATm0O62EvBpRx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< response>

<Review>We like a lot eating out. Last night we arrived in this fine place which we didn’t know before. We passed a lovely evening there with first-rate cooking and a well-trained team and  a professional cook. We put this restaurant in our list  and we will certainly visit again soon. We warmly recommend.< /Review>< pics>

<text>Found this place two weeks ago.  We had the spicy pork, & beef bugolgi.  It was so delicious, we went back last week too!  The portions were big, so we got to have leftovers for dinner.

My daughter brought me here and I love it. Finally got to try 1 of the famous Korean noodle, black bean noodle and it was really good. I went to another Korean bbq restaurant and karaoke place and wanted to try the black bean noodle but they were sold out for the day. But this place here actually served it.< /text>

I like this spot! They serve first-rate dishes, they have a rich menu, The cook in that place is very experienced, I love a lot eating all their dishes. The dishes are consistently fresh, the attitude towards the clients  is friendly. I visit often this place and I was never disappointed. I recommend it with no hesitation.<//Text>

Their food is very authentic. Being from So Cal, it has been hard finding good cuisine here in Fresno. I ordered a Bibimpab. Delicious.

My only gripe is the food was spicy. Too spicy for me. Including the Kimchi. I dont like spicy and it ruins the flavor for me.

I'm going to get some food today and try it out for the second time but different dishes< /text>

If you’re looking for Korean food, this is not the place you. If you’re looking for Chinese with a Korean twist and don't mind food that has a processed/packaged flavor, give it a try. Staff was nice.<//Text>

You know, I wouldn't go here if there better Korean options, but this place is quite decent. Homely, decent food options. I don't recommend this for the Korean food critic but their bibimbap and soft tofu(soondueboo) is quite decent. Their galbi is inconsistent, it might be amazing one day and quite chewy the next. Overall great and I come here often< /Text>

Just found out about this place a few days ago & it’s definitely a hidden gem in Fresno! The food is authentic & the quantity of it was even too much for two to finish! Will definitely recommend for those to try and will be returning to try out other dishes!!
We had the Bimbibap, spicy noodles, and combo meat plate. Total less than $35 for all of this. this is not a ordinary “restaurant” and the lady and the guy were really kind! Loved the service and was not disappointed.</review>

I have been looking for a Korean restaurant in the Fresno area that I liked every since my old restaurant closed. Asiana's food was good, and the service was also good. There was a language barrier, (which was easily overcome) and they did not offer menus. So be prepared!</Text>

It's a little place that's a shop and a restaurant. The ladies there are very nice and were excited to see me come in! The food was pretty good, especially within Fresno, this is a place has pretty decent prices for Korean food. I got Korean ice cream in the shop after my meal, which was nice~ Only downside for me was that it is far from where I live and work. But it's a nice, easy shop to visit if you're looking for a simple meal.<//Text>

Interaction is a little awkward because the lady that works there doesn't speak much English. Besides that however the service is really great. You can hear and smell as your dish is being made and it is done in a timely manner. The food itself is super delicious. It is connected to a small Korean market so you can treat yourself with some Korean ice cream after!<//review>

<Review>Hidden gem in Fresno! Bibimbap was delicious for only $10! It was big enough that I could've only eaten half of it and saved the rest for second dinner, but it was too yummy.

The owners were super friendly and even gave me a special box of pickled radish that they only make for the restaurant.

It's in a hard to find location behind a motel... but, seriously, it's the real deal. I will definitely be back and will bring everyone I can!< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

My sisters and i just had one of the best spicy tofu soup there. You will never know how great spicy tofu soup is until you have theirs. It is a family restaurant with only the parents working there, so there will be some wait but they usually have the Korean tv show on for entertainment while you wait. The price ranges about $10.99 and up but don't worry, they have side dishes too (their kimchi is really good, I like mine sour though) (idk if the side dishes are available for to go food). There are some language barrier, but don't worry, just point to the picture/food you want if you do not know the name of the food. They don't have a menu pamphlet because all the food is posted on the wall or by the counter. Hope you guys go and enjoy the food there.< /text>

Stopped in on a whim. I'd seen this place in the past and have always been curious what it was like. I was pleased to find they serve bibimbap's, so I had to try one. For $9.80 (after tax), this was a pretty good meal! Most places I've found in Fresno that serve bibimbap's charge $15+. I would have liked a little more meat, and I think a sweeter chili sauce would go better with the meal, but it's still a lot of food for the price, and I'm sure I'll be going back!</Text>

A hole in the wall where you can get some authentic Korean food and also Korean products. Service takes a little time, so patience is necessary when coming here.<//text>

If you don't care about service, just mainly for the Korean food. Then it's OK. If you don't need any smiling face, then it's OK to come enjoy the food.</review>

된장찌개와 돌솥비빔밥 강추
요세미티 오가는 길목이라서

<Review>As my car was getting some early Monday morning service, I wanted to have a healthy, relaxing breakfast (not just greasy or sugary to-go stuff).
So glad I found w/in reasonable walking distance of my dealership the Chocolate Bar Cafe, aka CB Bistro Hollywood!
Got to munch on 2 different types of savory breakfast pastries that have scrambled eggs, bacon, tomato, spinach, etc. In them.
Also got myself seated by the window to people watch and avail of their free WiFi.
Really cool, locally walkable place that even has outdoor & 2nd floor seating.
Thank you for giving me a calmly positive start to my week, CB Bistro Hollywood!<//Review>< pictures>

<Rating>3< /Rating><Text>I've been to plenty of cafes and this one was not the worst but also not the best. It is however a casual spot if you want fast and simple sandwiches or salads. My friend brought me here since I rarely step into Hollywood the environment is really cute and the decor is very laid back. I could see myself going back to study or if I want coffee if I'm in Hollywood other than that I would not go back.</Text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
Ive been there three times in one week,.. well twice as they were closed on Tuesday afternoon.  Cakes are delicate, but the Almond Croissant is mind blowing.  The Chocolate Croissant probably is too, I loved it, but was happily distracted from the Almond I ate first.  I wouldn't usually eat two in a row, one was for my partner, but the egg sandwiches I picked up at another restaurant messed up my order,.. I said "no meat, just egg and cheese, and when I got home it was just meat, no egg or cheese.  I don't eat meat, so my partner ate it and gave me his croissant.  Long story short, The Chocolate Bar must be visited at least two or three times to maintain perspective on first impressions. The key is being selective, not over doing it. Do you get what I'm saying,.. the Almond was so good, that what I really needed was to be alone with the experience.  I will return most definitely, but it will always be an exercise in moderation.  Full disclosure, if it's baked and done well, I'm there.  Just in case you thought I was over selling.< /Review>

The pastries are simply amazing. The croissants are fresh and tasty. Last time I was here I had the BLT. But I'm slowly working my way through the menu because there are so many scrumptious sweet and savory options. This is a great spot for a meeting or a first date.<//Text>

Hit & Miss
Sometimes the service is great.
Today I had to wait 5 minutes for anyone to even come up to the counter & acknowledge me.
Not sure what was going on.
Then they didn’t have any soup.
Most times it’s pretty good.<//Review>

The pastries are delicious and fresh. The almond croissant, was better than ones I had in Paris!! The almond paste is just sublime.
Customer service is fantastic. Edgar made sure all of our needs were met, while we were there, and then some!!
We'll be back!</review>

The croissants are hard and dry,
Because they do not sell them.

< Review>
I had their cappuccino today and it was very fresh - smooth & rich. The other time I've been to Chocolate Bar Cafe, I had the chicken empanadas; they were also delicious. I'm looking forward to trying their sandwiches!< /Review>

<Review>I met an insurance client of mine there for a policy delivery and we were delighted with our drinks.  I had the hot chocolate and it was absolutely delicious! Definitely a great alternative to the noisy congested starbucks scene.  I'll be coming back often!<//Review>< GmapID>

Our waiter was very friendly and they seemed to enjoy us having a child there. I am not a steak person but for $44 it wasn't what I thought it should be.  It wasn't bad just not the best steak I have had. The ice cream sandwich was delicious.< /review>

Absolutely surprising meal served quickly and hot and boy was it good.  The restaurant was really busy but we could not tell given our service.  One item not delivered because the waiter notice it was not as ordered.  Had to ask for the item and the manager brought it to us explaining what happen.  I would highly recommend this place.  Great job Hurleys...< /text>

We ended up eating at Hurley's by happenstance. (The 2 restaurants to which we were recommended to go to, both had  2 hour waits) We could not have been happier, Christian our server was extremely accommodating and we were all pleasantly surprised by how delicious everything was. We had the calamari, Moroccan beef skewers and Atlantic mussels as appetizers. I had the short ribs as did my friend and it was melt in your mouth delicious. I have to say what a great surprise this place was, no bottle charge and the chocolate cake to top it all off was perfect. I highly recommend it!< /text>

<text>We celebrated a birthday here with a large group, and they were amazing! They printed out menus with a birthday shout out, made a special dessert platter, and the food of course was amazing. So pleasant and easy to coordinate with. Highly recommend Hurley's!<//text>< Pictures>

<review>I love the lunch specials. The food is always excellent. There is a wide variety to choose from if you don't want the special. The special always includes a soup or salad and an entree with the protein carb and vegetable. I drive out of my way to have lunch here!<//review>< Pics>

Sat in the cold . Thought the heaters didn't work until we saw one on when we exited.
Forgot our side dish then served us macaroni and cheese of a soupy consistency. Doubtful the Mac ever saw an oven. Brought the side dish long after the entrees were consumed. Had to find someone for a plate.
Brought other dogs water but did not offer us water for our dog until a different server brought water for a dog at another table and we complained.
A lot of money for very little.</Text>

They tell us they have kid's menu before I ask.
They seperate one order to separated dishes because I tell them we want to share.

<Review>We love Hurley's! For excellent Bib Gourmand recommended dining, you can't beat this local's favorite in wine country. Our favorites include the Short Ribs, Wild Boar and the lunch burger. Always a friendly staff with great service, and they are dog friendly on the patio!<//Review>< Pictures>

Our waiter was Craig and he was so polite and professional, he made us feel very comfortable.

Our food and dining experience was one of the best I've had in a long time. The Sea Scallops with Potatoe Gnocchi was spectacular! There were so many flavors that melded together perfectly. Everything was delicious from the bread to the dessert.

I highly recommend this place.</text>< gmap_id>

<review>Food is always delicious and consistent however, the waitress had the personality of a slug and acted as if we were a bother and struggled to crack a smile. It is our anniversary so to be treated that way is very disappointing. We will think twice about returning. We usually leave a 20% tip but not this time.  Hurleys should replace her and I am sure if they read this they know exactly who the waitress is. Sunday evening 6/12/16< /review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

I stopped at the bar for pre-dinner drinks. The bartender was excellent! She dealt with some rude customers very gracefully. Most guests are polite; the rude people were atypical. The drinks were good, too.<//Text>

<review>To start my waiter Mark saved the Day. My wife and I were looking at the menu and hostess came out to tell us they had the best burger in Napa, so we went in and sat down.

Everything we ordered was good, except for the burger. I ordered it medium rare and they brought me a burger burnt to a crisp, no exaggeration. Mark agreed it was not even close to medium and sent it back. Hostess said the burger was closer to Medium, which was irritating.  Anyway, they brought me a second and it too was burnt to a crisp. I ate what I could out of frustration and Mark took it off the bill.

Go somewhere else to eat, less you be dissapointed with sub par food in a foodie Mecca.< /review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<Review>My wife and I went to Napa for our 20th Anniversary. Hurley's was one of the establishments we visited (9/26/2015). The area and the atmosphere are very nice. The restaurant itself is pretty cool - decor, layout, etc, etc,. We expected the place to be on the pricey side, so, no problems there. The problem comes where you expect to get what you pay for. The value was just not there at this establishment. The server was a bit disheveled, although surprising for a restaurant like this, that's easily overlooked for a number of reasons - people can have bad days. Where my one star rating comes from was the "Seared Ahi". My wife and I love this dish and have enjoyed it countless times at a number of different establishments. It's pricey because it is Sushi grade fish that requires extra care to keep, prepare and present in order for it to be enjoyed properly (and without getting sick).

The Seared Ahi we were delivered was warm in the center (as opposed to cool). When searing cold Ahi Tuna properly, it is a very quick process that leaves the center of the fish cool. Additionally, the Ahi was served on a warm plate. Warm!. No, No, No... Never.. So what you have is warm raw fish being served on a warm plate - this is something that can turn bad almost immediately in these conditions. They're taking a premium dish and turning it into garbage and a health risk. I alerted the server to our surprise and borderline disgust immediately and asked her to consult the chef regarding this (because NO chef worth their salt is serving this dish this way).

Later, the manager came by the table to ask how everything was, well, we brought this to her attention and she said that she had consulted with the chef and that the dish was indeed served how the chef had intended. In total disbelief, I asked to consult with the chef. The manager said that they had JUST gone home (with a deer in the headlights look on her face). Mind you, it was 7pm, the height of the dinner hour - the place was filling up; ain't no way the chef is going home. She lied to me. No apologies or offer to make things right or anything like that - why would there be?, after all, it was the intention of the chef to serve fish on the fast track to decay and becoming scrombroidal - right?

We spoke with the server once again when paying the bill, because, it was she, Queen Of Dishevel, that stated she would speak with the chef. She didn't of course. She spoke with the manager. That's what they always do in hopes that the manager can provide some type of mechanism (which she made zero attempt to do) to keep their tip from being affected.

So, in essence, nobody cared that they were serving garbage, with health hazard risks, at a premium price.

In a nutshell, the issue was a chef that seemed ignorant to the dish, a manager that didn't care and a server that woke up ten minutes before coming to work.< /Review>< pictures>

This school is the BEST ever!! Elena helped me every step of the way and I passed the exam on the first time, just as she said I would.  This school truly takes care of everything!  Thank you so much to Contractors State License School for all your help in getting my contractors license.  I am pleased with my experience and I want to let everyone know that this is the place to go!< /text>

Highly recommended to everyone looking to get the contractors license. I purchased study materials and tests from few different schools and I ended up using only materials from Contractors State License School.  Other schools didn't have enough info. These materials covered everything that was in the actual exam!  Don't waste your money on other study materials.
Buy them from Contractors State License School  and you'll everything you need to pass the exam. Ask for Craig Clivans, he helped me purchasing the books and tests in a very timely manner.< /text>

<Text>I’m going to be honest. I was a bit scared to make the jump but after calling and talking to Julio Avila they really made things so much easier to understand. He explained everything in detail and answered all my questions. He had a great attitude and was very respectful even when I asked him to explain things over one more time. He hooked me up with a promotion wished me luck and sent me on my way. I’m exited to start and hopefully get my license ASAP. Let’s do this!!!<//Text>< pics>

I have nothing but great things to say about this school. From the moment I decided to enrolled all the way until the end. I went to my online classes and the instructors are very helpful. At the time of my application submission Juliette Macksoud at The Lawndale school helped me with even the most random questions. I have nothing but appreciation to my instructors and Juliette. I strongly recommend the school. Classes are interactive, the books are very helpful. Overall a great experience</text>

I had a great experience getting all the information I needed before signing up. Julio Avila from the Van Nuts location helped me through the whole registration process and answered all my questions. I would highly recommend this program if you are interested in getting your contractors license.</review>

<response>None< /response><text>Mr. Avila was very informative, clear with instructions as well as answers as to how to achieve maximum learning and performance from this program.  Definitely would recommend this to individuals who are self disciplined and need little to no guidance to meet their goal.  Once materials have arrived and the actual learning experience has commenced, more reviewers will be posted to give further information to future interested individuals.  As of now, the best is not to be discouraged. Partner up with a mentor so that you also receive one on one guidance while studying for your exam.  Good luck!!< /text>< user_id>

This review is mostly for Debra Romero and how amazing she's been in helping me with all of my needs. I speak with her almost weekly needing some sort of a Certificate, or a bond, or insurance. She's helped me with claims and also finding out information for me to obtain my T1 Cal osha Permit. Her attitude and responsiveness helps my business run smoothly and she is an amazing representative of her company. CSLS also helped me obtain my C42 License which was great, though Debra has made it so that I continue my business with the company due to her guidance and professionalism, I would not be where I am today without her help .If you need anything Debra is just an email or call away, you will not be disappointed if you contact her directly for all you insurance needs.<//Review>

Prior to today I’ve been collecting information about acquiring my General Contractors license and let me add all those other places had me feeling like they just wanted my $$ and not put any effort in engaging in trying to get to know my goals and how far I want to go with my decision !!! Well long story short !! Thanks Julio Avila!! This schools need more people like u who listen and reminds u that this is the first step to accomplishing my goal !! Any Contractor School who hire this man shows not only that they care about the image  of their school but speaks high volumes of what to expect as a student !! Sign me on !!!< /text>

I contacted this school, after hearing the great review from him. Got the information and filled out the form online. The next day, I spoke with Peggy Burdick, a administrative counselor.  She was wonderful! She explained how the school works, and answered all of my questions quickly. She made so comfortable talking to her, I feel that I've made a new friend. I feel that this whole school, and especially Peggy, is geared toward success,  and they are going to help, in any way, to help me achieve my goal of becoming a contractor.  I highly recommend this program for anyone looking for this type of training. Thanks for everything! Sincerely,  James Randall.< /text>

It's a really great and reliable service these guys provide! I was fortunate enough to be helped by Alissa Ramirez, she really did a great job walking me through the whole process! I just passed my exams 2 days ago and now I'm ready to send all my info to receive my license and Alissa is still helping me getting my corporation started! So they will help you before and after you pass your tests!
Thank you Alissa! :)< /Review>

<text>Do your self a big favor and stay away from this school!!!
I signed up for the C-10 back in June 2020, due to Covid I was promised to have a crash course online, as I told Diego who signed me up the date of my upcoming exam he disappeared on me, him and the entire company, when I asked for a refund I was told that Miriam from accounting will call me, needless to say, she never did. After I failed my test, I called them again and fell for the second trap, after they promise me that I'll have an online crash course. That didn't happen either!!!
The worst think is their customer service, once they get your money, you can forget about them. I had to call Diego from another line for him to pick up the phone, I left so many massages and never heard back.
Simply a disgrace!!!<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<text>I worked with Pegi Burdick directly to ultimately reactivate my General Contractors Class-B license. She was more than helpful and always available for my phone calls regarding materials, test timing and of course the $$$. She made the process as easy as it could be. This process is highly recommend to any new GC or an old pro looking to dust off the skill saw and get back in the game.
Thanks again and Cheers to you Mrs. Burdick!<//text>< pictures>

I had a great experience with Pegi Burdik at CSLS
She was so knowledgable and friendly.. She got right to the point and answered all my questions. If you are interested in finding out about getting your first or your fifth contractors license she is the one to speak with.

<Review>I would like to give Elena Garcia at the Van Nuys location, five stars. from the moment I walked into the office to sign up for the class,She has been great. She walked me through the entire process of what to expect. Even after I passed the general B class,the service did not stop there. She called me to wish me CONGRAULATIONs and gave direction for the final steps. Elena,thank you for all of your help.

Pegi Burdick returned my call promptly and was very clear with explaining the steps I needed to take. Enrollment took only a few minutes. If you are planning on using this school ask for Pegi. She's a very pleasant person to work with.<//Review>

If you do what they say. You will pass! They never stop helping you even after you get your license. They have great teachers and management. I would especially like to thank the team at the Van Nuys location that were very patience with my lack of knowledge. I will be going back for other trades. That's for sure. Alyssa was especially kind. Thank you all so much...<//Review>

Making that phone call to the Contractors State License School was the best decision I have made.  I was nerves to call, but when Pegi was on the other end, everything changed.  She eased my anxiety and she provided me with all of the information I needed to enroll my brother and a friend  for their Contractor's License.  Oh, I also decided to enroll in a Blue Print Reading course starting October 31,2020.  I can't wait to begin!!  Pegi, your kindness is immensely appreciate.  I value the help you have given me and my family.

So, for those out there who are ready to take the next step in your career, I highly recommend to call Pegi.  She's the one!!!!<//review>

<Review>Amazing experience! I pass my exam on 1st time. They prepare good materials, including audio and video CD. Classes with Nick was very helpful! After this classes book becomes understandable. He give us a lit of tricks how to memorize materials and successfully pass the exam.
Then administrator Elena on reception desc was very helpful! Guiding step-by-step in each process of paperwork it gives you confidence in what you doing!
So my experience with this school is amazing! Highly recommended!!!<//Review>< UserId.>

Elena and Alyssa are amazing! They literally helped me every step of the way and are so amazing to work with. I’m so thankful for them at this school.

The study prep material they give you is pretty good to. I highly recommend taking Nick for law and trade (try and take crash course closest to your exam date really helps)

They don’t teach you trade besides giving you course material because you’re supposed to know it already ... so if you need to brush up look in the books. That being said the study material they give you for the trade is super helpful. Just a heads up some of it goes really into detail when it’s not super necessary, so don’t stress it too much<//Text>

So i really had a great experience with this school. Had some bumps on this long journey personally for me. But i finally did it and did not give up. School was very helpful and the practice exams helped me tremendously. Just want to say not to give up if you fail exam keep going like I did. Thank you also to Lydia Sobalvarro for the guidance and my bond. JF< /Text>

Hello, potential contractors this is a student of CSLS recently, I have been in the trades for over 15yrs and going to make the move to become a contractor this decision doesn't come lightly i could have just fill my application , take the test with the state but wait this isn't something you should do without knowledge. One bright and educated individual by the name Pegi Burdick helped me make a decision on becoming a smarter tradesman on business and law of the trade which will help me navigate through the paper work jobs will demand.  The information, CDs, packet of study guides and well put binder will help me succeed all I have to do is apply myself and if I need any questions answered  Pegi Burdick does a  wonderful job getting that information and point you in the next step of the process. I do recommend this school before you do it yourself you don't want to go blind into this business of trades.<//Text>

<review>The staff were really friendly and informative. The information given to you is very straight forward and easy to learn. All the material provided is there to help you pass your exams and you passing will depend on you studying or not. Alyssa at the front counter was very and I can not stress enough how helpful she was to me. From start to finish she assisted me in all of my paperwork and made things easy to grasp.

<Review>Hello, potential contractors this is a student of CSLS recently, I have been in the trades for over 15yrs and going to make the move to become a contractor this decision doesn't come lightly i could have just fill my application , take the test with the state but wait this isn't something you should do without knowledge. One bright and educated individual by the name Pegi Burdick helped me make a decision on becoming a smarter tradesman on business and law of the trade which will help me navigate through the paper work jobs will demand.  The information, CDs, packet of study guides and well put binder will help me succeed all I have to do is apply myself and if I need any questions answered  Pegi Burdick does a  wonderful job getting that information and point you in the next step of the process. I do recommend this school before you do it yourself you don't want to go blind into this business of trades.< /Review>< pics>

I became licensed contractor through this school and the moment I walked in through the doors the staff were friendly and very helpful. Alyssa r, Lydia s, Claudia s, are one of the most helpful and knowledgeable people in their career field. I have gone back months after I graduated in regards to some questions I had and some help I needed, they not only welcomed me with open arms but helped me out as much as they could and got all my questions answered. Truly amazing people and overall a wonderful school. thank you guys for everything.<//Review>

They help you every step of the way and are always motivating you to get everything done in a timely manner while guiding you all along the way. I am very pleased with the overall experience as well as the classes and instructors. Believe me, its a process to become a contractor and luckily you have the support system to help you get through it.

A very special thank you to Alyssa Ramirez who put up with all of the obstacles I faced in this journey and always helped me every step of the way. She is very kind and is always on top of everything even if you yourself become careless. Alyssa helped me out so much and I am very happy I had the ability to progress the necessary requirements I needed in order to get me to pass my exam and get licensed. I am forever greatful and I will always support CSLS and their wonderful staff but of those most importantly the shining star of CSLS, Miss Alyssa Ramirez!<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None< /Response></record>

<Text>Shopped around for contracting schools before settling on CSLS.  Pegi Burdick was my contact at CSLS.  She was informative, patient, and pleasant.  I called several times and every single time, she was available to take my calls and answer my questions.  CSLS may not be one of the most inexpensive but their experience, knowledge, and customer service is well worth the price.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Customer service is great. Carol Aldana helped me reschedule my crash course classes several times based on the State changing the test dates due to the Covid-19 closures. Carol is cheerful and helpful.
The whole system they have set up to help you pass your test is great. Can't say enough good things about this company.<//review>

I had a great experience at CSLS while preparing to take the General  Contractor B test, which I passed on the first time. Due mainly to the great staff there in preparing me with the right material's  and the format to study for the two exams I took,  which were the  Trade and Law courses for General Contractor B license.  The two people who really stood out with their professionalism and where incredibly helpful and supportive in preparation for the  exam's were Alyssa and Lydia, these  two are the best and I can't them enough. Just listen to what they have to say and study, study, and study , because all the material that's needed is there to pass any test they throw at you.<//Review>

<review>Since my first conversation with Pegi Burdick, I have felt like I was putting the fate of me passing my exam in the right hands. Pegi is extremely knowledgeable, helpful, friendly and personable. She has always answered any call that I have made to her and takes the time to make sure all of my questions are answered. My exam date is at the end of this month and I feel confident that I will pass with flying colors. -Mike West</review></record></dataset><record>

<review>Great customer service ,Lydia Sobalvarro was very welcoming and assisted with my paperwork and bond to get my license. The only thing I want to add that was disappointing is that I didn't pass my trade exam on my 1st try. Materials need a  bit more improvement. But overall all I recommended this school.</review><response>None</response>< user>

My name is Creole Walker and I just enrolled with Contractors State License School today. I had the absolute pleasure of meeting and speaking with Pegi Burdick who assisted me with the whole process. She kindly put down her lunch to take care of me and did so with graciousness and a wonderful sense of humor! Pegi made me feel at ease and confident in my success, mainly because she assured me of her unending support and commitment to me becoming licensed. Thank you Pegi, for a wonderful beginning to this journey!<//text>

I was recommended by few friends to contact CSLS for help in acquiring my general B. I can’t tell you how glad I am that I did. Pegi Burdick has been so helpful with all my questions and concerns around the process. She has simplified The steps so you don’t get overwhelmed.

I highly recommend CSLS to everyone looking to take the next step to getting there license.</Review>

I called this school over a year ago.  Pegi told me everything I needed to know and I was just to scared to invest in myself/company.  I held off, never forgetting the conversation that I had with Pegi.  I remained focused on growing my business and when I was ready I couldn't find her contact info.  I was so ready that I reached out to a different school to inquire and possibly enroll.  The experience I had with the enrollment advisor at the other school DID NOT compare.  The rapport built in that first call with Pegi had set the expectation and nothing else would do.  I spent the last month hunting down notes, going through phone records, and going through emails to find her.  Her knowledge base is unmatched and you can tell that she genuinely cares.</Text>

When I initially called to ask about the program I wasn’t able to do it, but Pegi took the time to call me back several months later. She walked me through everything and has been very encouraging and helpful. I really appreciate all the time she takes to explain things over the phone and how quickly she emails me what I need. Thank you for all your help Pegi!</Review>< pictures>

I have been considering to obtain my state license for some time now. I called and spoke with Pegi Burdick and honestly we connected, she was very knowledgeable and helpful, she also will provide the necessary assistance for my success. Looking forward to add another success story to their long list of satisfied customers.

I would like to take a moment to give a special THANK YOU to  ALYSSA she was so helpful.

I would recommend this school to anyone looking to get licensed 100% GREAT EXPERIENCE all around</Text>

Got a hold of CLCS and spoke to a very friendly person - Pegi- she helped me every step of the way towards getting me set up for my contractor license exams and related information.

Pegi was very informative and answer all my CSLB questions,
To be honest what made me choose this school verses two others,  was the customer support and friendly staff that I spoke too, Pegi was very thorough and  very professional.

I highly recommend this school to anyone wanting to prep for state and trade exam to get your contractor license, it’s worth the $$$

I really recommend this school if you ever want to do you license.
All the team are really nice, helpful, professional and doing everything to make sure that you'll pass your exam first time.
Also after I pass the test Alyssa was there to answer all my questions,  and helped me with the paperwork and bond for my new license.</Text>

<text>Pegi is the real deal, she genuinely looks out for your best interests and helps guide the best path for your individual needs.  She helped me with some tough questions and decisions, and made the whole process easy and efficient.  And she always makes herself available if you run into any speed bumps along the way.

I was not expecting this level of customer service from a contract licensing school, but have been very pleasantly surprised by how great every one affiliated with the school has been so far!</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

Can’t say enough but this company and Alyssa have done it again 16 years ago they helped me in getting my c-8 and c-29. Today after a month they once again did their job again I passed with ease my c-53 so I’m very happy for the way the school is set up to succeed. Thank you to you all 😊😊</text>

<text>I called to inquire about getting my contractors license and was transferred to Pegi. She took the time to explained to me the entire process and options available. I signed up that day and 2 weeks later I was taking my first class. My classes where in the long beach location and the instructor Bill was great. Had lots of energy and kept it fun which was a good since the classes are at 630pm and after a full day of work it kept the energy in the room live and awake. I'm currently waiting for my test date but feel prepared and Pegi has always been available to answer my questions and help me along the way.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Need to say that this school helped me to get my C6 and the courses helped. The key to passing is study and keep in mind the state test is very different you need to put 100% of your effort to pass.

Pegi Burdick was great at getting me set up with the school and Edith Howard was extremely helpful in scheduling classes and the application process.  Thank you both for all your help.  The classes are very informative and the abundance of information provided in the workbooks, online classes and practice tests is extremely helpful.
Thank you CSLS for your help. Zach H<//text>

Need to say that this school helped me to get my C6 and the courses helped. The key to passing is study and keep in mind the state test is very different you need to put 100% of your effort to pass. Thank you Lydia for helping me with my application and passing forms. AWESOME Customer Service.< /text>

<Text>I have to stop and recognize Alyssa Ramirez at Contractor State License School, Van Nuys Ca location. She was a huge help in assisting me to pass my exam.  She answered all of my questions along the way, in detail. She was never too busy to stop and clarify something that I needed help with. In addition, she was encouraging and always had a positive attitude. Very hard to find these days. She always returned my phone calls within a very reasonable amount of time, which is very important to me. This  company’s mission is to make contractors out of qualified personal, and Alyssa exemplifies this in everything she does for her clients. Thank you Alyssa for everything you do!</Text>< pictures>

<review>I recently passed my Gen B law and trade exam. My experience at CSLS was crucial to my passing the exams and obtaining my qualification. Lydia & Alyssa were super helpful, professional and personable and we're incredibly knowledgeable and helpful though a very meticulous application and exam process. Any business or organization is only as good as the people you come into direct contact with and Lydia and Alyssa were incredible and integral to my obtaining my lofty goals.  I couldn't be happier with the training I received at the school and the guidance by the staff.< /review><username>Mike Buchbinder< /username><resp>None< /resp><Rating>5</Rating><Pics>None</Pics>< GmapID>

I called the 800-number and was then sent to this very kind woman named Peggy Burdick. She walked me through all my different options, the special discounts available at the time, shared her own personal experiences and things she learned from mistakes in the past. I could really tell she had my best interest in mind. Very quick to respond and move me along the process. The  level of support I received was just the things I needed to move forward with my business. Thank You Peggy!< /text>

I just had to post and say a HUGE THANK YOU, to Pegi Burdick! She is a fabulous, wonderful woman, with so much knowledge, and confidence in her program. As she walks you through each and every step of the process, it is so much less intimidating..I would have been lost without her... If your looking to get your contractors license, please ask for her, you won't be disappointed...Sincerely, Stacey< /review>

<Review>I'm very fortunate to have been put in contact with Peggy Burdick. I had called CSLS to gain some information about obtaining my general contractors license. Peggy is an absolute gift to this school! The amount of information she provided me with was astonishing.  At no point did I ever get an "I don't know" or "I'll have to transfer you to someone else who can assist you". She had all the answers. Impeccable doesn't fully describe Peggy.  I'm at a loss for words to describe how truly grateful I am for her. I appreciate everything that she has done, is doing, and I'm sure if needed, will continue to do to help me in getting my license. More importantly,  I appreciate her! Thank you for being you Peggy! I could ramble on about how awesome and helpful she is, but I'm sure I'm not the only one and I definitely wont be the last person to show appreciation where it's due! Peggy, without you I would be lost throughout this process!< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

I enrolled in the class with a little hesitation but soon was comforted by Alyssa. She guided me every step of the way and was very patient with my inability to comprehend the order of which everything that needed to happen. She was very helpful in explaining everything in detail and setting everything up to start my business. I passed both the law and trade for my B license on the first try and it was due to the schooling. I enrolled in the in class and crash course (taken the days before my test) and passed.

I did research on other schools but liked the support from this one. I highly recommend.< /Review>

Pegi Burdick, deserves more than 5 starts.. professional, knowledgeable, listens and recommends the best license and option for your future path /career. In a world that is predominately men, after talking to Pegi few times, I'm encouraged to study hard and get my Contractor license to go along all my experience. I enjoy learning about her experience and all the works she is done to get where she is , it's admirable.  Pegi, you are an amazing counselor, positive and encouraging and HONEST. Thank you!!

The overall experience was great and easy to follow. Peggy helped along the way and was very helpful. Definitely a 5 star experience, would recommend this to others trying to follow this path.

Carol and her team were able to help with my concerns and because of that I feel that the school will do the wright thing, when push come to shove.

P.S. I would recommend that you keep you own records for classes that you are schedule for and that you check in once in a while to verify that the information is still correct. Thank you again Carol.</Text>

The CSLS Van Nuys campus was great to work with they encouraged their students to study and help each student navigate the myriad paperwork and forms required to secure a contractor's license. I was lucky enough to deal with Alyssa Ramirez, a Student Administrator, who was absolutely fantastic to work with. Alyssa was positive and encouraging and a tremendous help getting through the process. I passed the test on the first try and I am waiting for my license to arrive in the mail!< /review>

I've been working with Pegi off and on for the past year.  First off she talked me off the ledge over a year ago when I told her I was a working mom with 2 little kids that I didn't have time to pass the exam.   She told me what to do, I took the school classes, and passed the first time.  Then after obtaining the license, I wanted to set up another organization and had questions on how to do that with the same License.  Of course Pegi knew step by step what to do, and even offered some professional advice counseling.  Of course I will be calling her again to handle all my applications and needs.  I wouldn't trust anyone else!</text>

<review>It was great working with Pegi to get my corporation and study program set-up.

She has answers for everything and has consistent follow-thru.

When she told me she had gone to school here 31 years ago. It all made sense why she

knew so much.

And, she is funny.

Get it done right the first time…call her< /review>< resp>

Our agent at the CSLS is Julio Avila and we highly recommend him as your agent. He is very knowledgeable, welcoming and friendly. We had an issue with our previous bond, and Julio efficiently walked us through every step of the way till everything got into its normal path again.<//Text>

Definitely the best school for getting all the education you need and the best professional help for obtaining your contractor's license. I was lucky enough to have Lydia help me with my applications and I can only say I've never had a more pleasant experience working with an office clerk. Thank you Lydia and CSLS!!!</Review>

Came to enroll in this school, law classes with instructors are very helpful. The online needs improvement and also materials. The school provides  audio CD & DvD's which that is a bit out dated. Providing study materials on s USB or flash drive would make no sense. Now a days no one owns CD  or dvd players. School counselor Lydia S was great helping me open my corporation,application and final paperwork to get my license. Thank you!!<//review>

Pegi helped us enroll our son in courses to prepare him for his inspector certification. She was a wealth of information and advice. She even researched questions that she couldn't immediately answer, called us back, and told us what she had discovered.
Pegi has a rare ability to connect with her customers. Her eagerness to help and her professionally competent, personable style made our interactions with her a completely satisfying experience.< /Review>

<review>I called CSLS a few months ago slightly confused about obtaining a contractors license and spoke to Pegi about what I need to do. After taking their classes and speaking to her several times throughout the process I would absolutely recommend Constractor State License School. Pegi Burdick answers my phone calls right away every single time and is always a great help. She has made a very confusing process simple and the classes were great. Would absolutely recommend !!</review>< user>

<Text>I couldn’t be more happy with ALL the staff at this school, especially Lydia and Alyssa. From first walking in the first day to after I passed my exam (the 1st time) . They all have been super helpful and friendly through the stressful 3 months . I would definitely recommend this school to anybody thinking about getting their license.

I'm leaving a 5 star review for the 5 star support I have received from Pegi Burdick. As soon I was put in contact with her she has worked around the clock to make sure she's available to answer any questions I have. She's has also been instrumental in making positive progress to my overall dream of becoming a licensed Contractor. I couldn't give enough thanks to all the help I've received from Pegi. Thank You!

Pegi Burdick has been a superb Admissions Counselor and has followed through timely and thoroughly to process my enrollment in the Law and Business on-line, self-study and crash courses.  She always made sure that documents and materials were delivered as promised.  I look forward to completing the courses.  Ms. Burdick has demonstrated a high level of competence and experience in making sure my training gets off to a great start!!!

Thanks, Ms. Burdick.

The only reason this all worked was because of Pegi Burdick. She was there to walk me through step by step and make sure not a single item was missed while I added another license and started a corporation. Pegi has been quick to respond and an absolute wealth of knowledge.

Amazing experience amazing people! Lydia Sobalvarro was my councilor and let me just tell you she’s amazing! She guided me through the whole process! From step one to the end and more! Only downfall was the communication over the phone! I always had to speak to another representative regarding my questions when I would really want to speak to Lydia! But I understand there are a lot of students maybe she was always busy! But other than that amazing experience I would recommend anyone who wants to become a licensed contractor to apply thru CSLS Van Nuys! Great personnel!</Text>

A friend of mine referred me to CSLS. I contact the school and spoke with Peggy Burdick.  Peggy was very positive and helpful with the process of signing up for my contractors license. She was more than willing to answer any of my questions about having a contractors license and the process of getting your license. I would refer anybody who is looking for a contractors license to contact Peggy Burdick.  I also did pass my contractors test on the first try and I am now in business. Thank you very much for all your help. I will continue to do business with CSLS.
Thank you Peggy!!< /Review>

I want to say thank you to everyone at CSLS especially Alyssa Ramirez.She was there from the first day I walked into the Van Nuys location to filling out the final paperwork to submit to the CSLB after passing both exams (on the first try). She was always available to answer any questions I had and  advise me of what I needed every step of the way. Alyssa, Thank you again!!
All the instructors were very knowledgeable and presented the information in an easy to understand format that was very similar to the format of the state exams.
All the study material was spot on. Very well organized and a great balance of text and audio. All the tests in the books were great study material in the 3 or 4 days prior to taking the exams.
I completed and passed the law section of the exam in just under an hour and the General B exam in just over an hour and a half. If it wasn't for CSLS, their amazing staff, and the way the study material is laid out I don't think I would have been able to breeze thru both exams the way that I did.

Thank you again to everyone at CSLS

Pegi was my counselor at CSLS and was amazingly helpful in her support and guidance in getting my license. I now have my Contractor's License and am SO GLAD I followed Pegi's suggestions in which course package to get at the school. It made taking the State exams very successful. I passed both exams on the first try. Pegi is fantastic and Alyssa and Lydia at the Van Nuys CSLB school are too. Every time I had a question or concern Pegi would call me back the same day. And if I needed any help with classes or had questions while at the Van Nuys school Alyssa and Lydia were always there to help. Getting my license was the best thing I could have ever done.

<Rating>5</Rating><resp>None<//resp><review>It was over a year ago that I was looking at the school and then I told Pegi that I was not going to take the test.  However Pegi did not give up on me.  She stayed in contact with for over 4 months.  Now that I have decided to take the test Pegi was the first person I thought and called of in making my final decision to enroll at the Contractors State License Schools.  Due to Pegi's pleasant method of staying in contact with me is what lead me to chose Contractors State License Schools.  Now she has imparted to me valuable information on how to study for the test.  I have not taken a test in years and have been avoiding doing this for over 10 years but after speaking with Pegi and sharing my concerns I am now confident that I will successfully pass the tests the first time.

Pegi Burdick was very helpful and patient when I had a lot of questions before I enrolled. And after enrollment everything went smoothly, from the application process to the classes every step was helped by the school's staff. They have a lot of practice tests which was a huge help because I saw a lot of the same questions on the actual exam. I passed the exam on my first try and am glad I chose CSLS!<//Review>

<text>I feel so fortunate to have chosen CSLS (Van Nuys) because I don’t think I would be a general b licensed contractor today if I had done it anywhere else or by myself, even though it seemed like the state board didn’t want me to get licensed, the staff held up by my side till the end, they are all professional, friendly, and informative from the moment you first meet with them, you know you’re in the right place, want to give special thanks to Alyssa, Claudia and Lydia and everyone else who worked directly or indirectly with my case, will re-enroll to get my inspector cert, and in a near future a second license, am greatful for everything!!!<//text><Rating>5< /Rating>< resp>

Pegi Burdick is the women to ask for when your ready to get serious about your contracting future. She is smart and understands the red tape your up against when getting your license from the CSLB. Give her a call with your questions she will answer them all and give you all the help you need to get your license. I'm looking forward to having my C-10 soon!<//text>

<text>Working with Pegi Burdick out of the Van Nuys office was off the chart! Not only was she well informed and professional she guided me through the entire process and went above and beyond to make the whole experience a most enjoyable one. Don't be surprised if I come down there in person to meet her and convenience her to come work with me in my contracting business in San Francisco. She is truly 1 in a million. There's just not enough starts to show my true appreciation. To ANYONE who is considering an education with CSLS give Pegi Burdick a call and you will be well on your way to making the big bucks!< /text>< userid>

This is the worst school all they do is take your money and they are not upfront with all the information you need to know. You buy a course for over 700.00 they give you a time limit to review the questions then if you miss that deadline it is 50.00 each for you to pay again for something you already paid for. I would not recommend this school.< /Review>

The worst school,  do not believe when they say you don't pay additional if you don't pass the test the first time, they charge you for every time you want to take a class, they don't teach trade , only law part do not go to this school, they are the biggest liar and if you confront them they just tell you it is how the school system works and nothing you can do about it.< /Review>

<Review>My 7 yr old had extensive work done so she went in under anesthesia, the front ladies were kind and welcoming, the anesthesia crew very informative and kind we felt our little one was in good hands, we felt the dentist did a great job, our little one was cranky as soon as she woke up, she had little pain but by the afternoon she was herself as happy as she could be, total success..thank you Children's Primary great job!< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

Every time I go in I’m greeted by their wonderful staff with a huge smile. Everyone there is so friendly and knowledgeable. They go beyond what’s expected to offer their patients a great experience. The office is super cute and kid friendly which is big plus.< /review>

I had to take the time to leave my review, I had an appointment today with my eight yr old and this was my third time in here. It would be so nice and considerate if they trained a little bit more the staff at the front office was upset because they didn't know how to answer properly to the questions. I was really close to change my dentist office because if this. I booked an appointment and One of the staff members at the front told me that hopefully they had the time to attend my child! Even though I was making an appointment! So I still decided to go bc this was an urgent procedure. Jeniffer was amazing since we got to our appointment today she made me feel welcome and she answered all of my questions, she treated my son with professionalism and as if it was part of her family! So if you ever book an appointment make sure to go to her. Jeniffer thank you ! You made us feel very welcomed !!! Definitely coming back!</review>

<Text>I came in today for both my toddlers cleaning(it was my 2yr old's 1st visit). The office was decorated so cute for Halloween. Dr. Erin and all the staff are so friendly. The staff made my girls feel welcomed with their warm smiles and hello's. This office defiantly caters to the kids the assistants offered different flavors for the girls to pick for their cleanings they had blue raspberry, cotton candy and mint. The girls also gave options for the girls to pick their toothbrush (Disney princess), and to finish the appointment The assistants offered the girls stickers and tokens for the toy tower. I mean what toddler doesn't love toys and stickers. The staff did an amazing job from the start of our appt till the end.</Text>< Date>

My son loves this place! The docs and techs are awesome with children. I left and tried out another dental office and was not happy. I came back after the 3rd visit and been here since! They truly take their time and lets my son know everything they are doing. Even when they are busy, you still in and out at a timely manner.  Thank you for the great service everytime!< /Text>

My kids were attended and I do not recommend this place because they don’t pay attention to the kids and they don’t care if the kids have pain or not. They have really bad service. The doctors don’t do a good job. All of the staff that work there are rude, and don’t have a positive attitude with the patients and never seem happy. I also saw the last visit that they don’t disinfect the tools that are used with the patients. Never will i take my kids there again.</review>

I was referred to this place for my son's dental surgery. The staff is nice, the place is extremely clean. Only issue, our appointment was cancelled the day of and I had a scheduled payment for it due to come out, when we cancelled the appointment, the front desk girl never took the payment plan out of their computer so I had been charged. They immediately reversed it but I never noticed the charge until I needed to pay for something and was 65 dollars short.< /Review>

Not a good choice! Its seems like this office is more a turn and burn kind of place. They did not make my child or I feel comfortable, they were very agressive with the anesthesia and when we got home a week later my sons tooth and cap broke off. Not worth the time, pain thid has caused my son!!!! Find a different dentist!!!!!!!!!!< /Review>

Lovely, chill property in downtown Los Olivos, reasonable prices, safe, outdoor social-distancing, friendly staff, and EXCELLENT wine.  One of my hands-down, stone-cold, all-time faves.  Highly recommended.<//Text>

<Text>A lovely stop amidst the others here in this quaint ol town which serves as the storefronts for so many great masterfully blended (or sometimes not) wines from the region. Epiphany has classic innovation and traditional soul of the grape infused in there selections, which have also spilled over into their,  "Bubble Shack" bubbly room. The wine, the people,  and the hearts that make up the staff make Epiphany an investment of your life worth the time,  if it's not to busy 😁 ... We are members there from the first time we visited, and Latoya and staff has taken great care of us ever since. You can also enjoy complimentary tastings at Fess Parker with membership
P.S.  nice  outdoor seating area.

<review>The wine was good and the outdoor seating is shady, perfect for hot days. The customer service is horrible. They bring your wine tastings out all at one time and make no mention of it beforehand. We each got a tasting so they brought out 15 glasses of wine tastes. By the time we got to the last one, it was hot and the flies were after it. The female waitress didn't smile once or come to check on us after bringing out the tastings. She didn't explain any of the wine to us or give us any info at all. We intended to purchase a few bottles but no one ever came back. Sad to have such terrible wait staff in the middle of a pandemic when I'm sure the owners can use all the sales they can get.</review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>{'time': 1598488038835, 'text': "Hi Jon,\n\nI'm so sorry you left your recent tasting experience with us disappointed. This sounds like a total service failure on our part and is certainly not the level of customer service that we are known for and strive to provide. I have passed along your message to our tasting room manager so that we can address this as a team. We do hope you'll give us another shot in the future. Again, we're so sorry!\n\nBest,\nGreer Shull & the Epiphany team"}</resp><gmap_id>0x80e9557784c0ad13:0x859d6ba588382658< /gmap_id></record>

Loved every bit of it. We came when it was busy but the wine was totally worth it! I highly recommend it. Our friends are split between here and Fess Parker. There's a sparklingly wine shack owned by the same family. We became members while we were there today. Being member of any of the properties, Fess Parker Epiphany's or the Bubble Shack, gives you benefits at all of them so it's a pretty great deal!<//review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>The wife and I made the trip to California on a five day adventure where we had a single goal. To visit Epiphany Cellars to do a wine tasting and buy some wine. The entire rest of the trip was to be completely unscripted. This has been the best trip ever and we have had so much fun. All because we wanted to go to Epiphany and they did not disappoint. This place is beautiful and the staff are amazing. We are really looking forward to making another trip out here soon.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Service is exceptional, great personalities and very attentive. With it's large outdoor seating area it's a perfect place to sit back and take in the moment.<//Text>< Pictures>

<Review>Wonderful tasting room and services! We had Ferrara through out tasting. She was knowledgeable and so friendly! We were in slightly in a rush to hit multiple wineries since we were in town for a short trip (we used to live on the Central Coast and wanted to hit all our favorite places before closing). She made the experience at this new ( for us) place a blast and we walked out with a case of wine!</Review><date>1518802326000</date>< userid>

Fantastic outdoor lounge, often you can order Epiphany wines and the nearby Champagnes from the shack in the back. Great service and dog friendly. The wines are pretty yummy, too!</Text>

<text>A nice modern style tasting room located right in Los Olivos. The wines are delicious and Epiphany has done a great job of creating an atmosphere that is welcoming. I like to do the tasting right at the bar but you can also buy a bottle and go sit out on their patio furniture in the lawn out front.

Clean restrooms are located just around the side of the building, you just have to request the key from someone inside.<//text>< date>

<Text>Epiphany is hands down our favorite winery in California. Their wines are of exceptional value especially the Rodney's Vineyard Petite Syrah and the Syrah/Cab Blend. Ken and the entire crew are amazing to work with and their redesigned Tasting Room in Los Olivos is chic and clean. We cannot wait to visit them again in March as it is always an amazing experience. Keep up the great work :)

<review>Two pourers hard at work today at the pick up party this weekend, one in November and one in May for wine club member. As usual, the tasting is free ($10 for non-member). Salami, different types of cheese, grapes, and crackers laid out for today...perks of a pick up party!

Parking is plentiful around this area with tons of other wine tasting stores to choose from, but why choose when you have Epiphany Cellars?! The menu today included 7 different types of wine (2 white, 5 reds). Epiphany always have other wines available off of the tasting menu, you will just have to ask!

PS. The Syrah Stagecoach is on sale, $36 for member! Another tip, get anything Grenache, absolutely fabulous!< /review>< pics>

<review>Epiphany is great -- especially their syrahs. You can cruise in here, do a tasting, then get a bottle of syrah if it’s a little cool and relax on a couch and drink it inside. Or, if it’s a little warm out, get yourself a bottle of chilled Grenache blanc and sit outside under the trees. Either way, you’re set.< /review>< Pics>

<text>New to the area and figured we would give this little deli a try. I didn't expect much, but I wasn't happy with what I got. I got an Italian sandwhich, and it had decent amount of meat on it, and 2 small spinach leaves, followed by hardest any cheese. The bread (had a onion hoagie roll) had a squirt of Italian salad dressing on it and was dry. My wife ordered the New York nod that was pastrami and swiss, they choose a pretzel roll. What she got was a measley pretzel roll with one slice of pastrami and one slice of swiss hardly any sour kraut and lathered in mustard. Neither of these sandwhiches was worth the $12 for them, $15 if you got the $2 snack size chip. Great liquor store for Downtown, but skip the food.</text>< Pictures>

It looks like just an ordinary liquor store if you pass by, but if that's what you do, pass by, you'll have missed downtown's best sandwich shop.

You may note the Boar's Head logo signifying quality meats are used. That's just the beginning. The big assortment of freshly baked breads (try the rosemary roll) makes an even bigger difference. The salads are bomb too. All this comes with neighborly customer service, and a wine and premium liquor selection that will delight the most discriminating connoisseurs.

So glad I found this place!< /Text>

I hate leaving bad reviews, but I mean cmon. I paid for a Ruben, and I got a cold, dry, sauerkraut sandwich with a single slice of pastrami. Not to mention the bread is stale and crumbling. Don’t order the Ruben. 🤦🏼‍♀️</Review>

The owner was so kind, accommodating, and caring. This was one of the few places that had a reasonably priced vegetarian option for my friend. She got one of the vegetarian sandwiches and LOVED it! I got the G&H special and got one half toasted and one cold so I could eat it later and it was DELICIOUS both ways (but definitely recommend it hot.) I also got the pasta salad and it was very tasty. The owner was very patient with me and checked on us multiple times while we were there. You can tell he genuinely cares about his store, the quality of the food, and his customers. I highly recommend this place!!</text>

If only I lived closer to this place, would definitely be going here more often. They just recently opened in the last few months and glad they did. It's a nice local deli with a delicious selection of freshly made sandwiches featuring Boarheads meat. The honey bee sandwich was perfect with turkey, bacon, avocado and a tangy mustard sauce. There are a few tables outside to eat or could  grab a sandwich to go and sit nearby at the park. The spot has broad selection of products that they sell like drinks, snacks, alcohol, etc... The gentlemen who helped us was friendly and personable, providing recommendations and making sure we were all set. It feels like it will become a local favorite in no time.</Review>

This doesn't look like much, but they make awesome sandwiches. I don't eat sandwiches very often, so I decided to go all out and get the Italian. It was huge. I could only eat half...but it was one of the best sandwiches I've had in a while.< /Text>

If I could give it no stars I would, delivery is horrible! I ordered my food at 9pm and an hour later still not have gotten my food, couldn't get a hold of the restaurant which was now closed at 10pm. I never got my food either! This is the second time I've ordered from here, the first time I ordered take out from here it came super late as well, but at least I got it. I've never not had food delivered after I ordered it. It's ridiculous. Don't waste your time and money here.< /text>

<Date>1625331764876< /Date><rate>5< /rate><Text>Everyone on the team was courteous and helpful.  Lydia, who handled my paperwork and preliminary exam, was engaged, friendly and competent. Dr. Horne immediately put me at ease ("please call me Joe") and continued to create a sense of ease throughout the exam.  Everyone communicated well.  The appointment started on time and proceeded efficiently. They processed my insurance easily and by the time I left, I had ordered frames--already received in less than 2 weeks. I recommend Pacific Eye Paso!< /Text>< pics>

Dr. Horne is very patient, explains procedures and address all of my concerns. He never rushes through the exam and takes his time making sure that my eyes are healthy. I appreciate that he takes his time getting the best prescription for me. He has been doctor for about 10 years and I am very grateful that I have him to turn to for my eye car.</review>

Dr. Spiegel is wonderful. Professional and quick but will take any time for questions. This was just a checkup. The retinal surgery two years ago gave me back my good vision. Very happy with the Doc.< /Review>

Dr. Hulberd is always professional, interested, caring and above all, imminently qualified. As long as he is practicing, I will never trust my eyes to anyone else. The technicians and staff are also friendly and efficient. I unhesitatingly recommend Dr. Hulberd.<//text>

< Review>
I love this office! They have always been a terrific office with a great staff, however they are even better now! They go out of the way to make sure that they have complied with all things necessary to keep you safe in this age of “Covid” craziness. Their office is over-the-top clean and safe. You need not worry about anything when you walk in the door. I’m not only over 65, but I’m also a nurse and I was completely comfortable...and that’s saying a lot for me. Great job everyone!,,</Review>

Dr. Oldenburg has been my eye doctor for nearly 10 years.  He's caring, explains clearly and in "English", and listens to you, the patient.  Can't recommend him highly enough.  Nice staff, too.<//Review>

<Text>From the beginning absolutely amazed by the professionalism and competency of each staff involved.  Scheduling an appointment was easy, less than a five minute wait upon arrival for appointment, explanation of examination process clearly provided and finally assistance from staff during the selection of eyeware was exceptional.  Definitely will be returning....</Text>< rating>

Of all the eye exams I've had over the years, pacific eye has been the best.  I went in as my right eye just wasn't right and they immediately sent me to an eye surgeon as I had a tear in the retina... all fixed on the same day.  Very impressed.</Review>

<Review>I dropped in without an appointment to pick up some eye drops.  The staff member I was there to see was out to lunch.  The receptionist at the front desk took the time to check on my drops, found they were ready for pickup and brought them out for me.  This eliminated the need for me to return at a later date.

Funny how I wrote a negative review on this location not so long ago and was removed out of no where, but again my dad went in to get a new phone Fernando promised to transfer all his pictures over which he didnt my dad was also asked if he wanted to trade in his phone which he said yes but make sure all my stuff is in my new phone, and again how i said none of his pictures transferred over nothing a kind gentleman helped him the following day chunky guy and was able to help my dad recover some pictures but not the important ones thank you for him for saving some but employees need to do a better job seriously not cool<//text>

Thanks for the awesome feedback on Fernando.'}</response><Text>I am so happy I chose to switch to metro by t-mobile after coming to this location. metro by t-mobile was offering a great Switcher deal so I went to this location to inquire more. I mostly dealt with Fernando. He was very knowledgeable professional and spent a lot of time helping me figure out the best set up for my family. I ended up getting more data, Amazon Prime for less money. He helped me get all my phones Data(contacts photos) Transferred and He also helped us get the best deal and also found the most efficient way to get everything set up. Everyone else in the store was friendly and knowledgeable, as well. I'll definitely return to this store for any help I need with my account. Thank you for your service our family appreciate you<//Text>< Rating>

<review>I stopped by about a month ago and talked to Fernando wanting to switch from spectrum to metro , we had been going back and forth and he was very helpful in helping me with switching to t-mobile he also checked my unlocked iPhone antenna compatibility with current 5g network and indoor and outdoor reception for my long road trips , I drive semi truck across country and reception is my priority when it comes to switching phone carrier , he was able to show exact coverage map and signal strength, I really appreciate your patience in answering all my questions and concerns ,
Finally made a switch and its been amazing and affordable and most importantly reliable coverage! Thank you t-mobile and thank you Fernando, I will always recommend this location to my peers , you guys rock<//review><Response>{'time': 1620949493945, 'text': 'We appreciate you Cynthia!

Never have I ever been so impressed by such great customer service. As soon as you walk in,  you're greeted by friendly staff members, right away willing to help you find exactly what you need. They really work together as a team to get the job done. I came in today hoping to find out which would be the best way to save money whether opening up a new account or adding a line to the current account that I have. All my questions were answered very well explained, they are very patient and don't rush you on making a decision, they are really here for your best interest, i've been coming to this location for last 10 years and owner and staffs will never let you down, i guarantee it , you will walk out with a smile!</Review>

< review>
I've been a metro customer for five or six years now and I refuse to leave them because I have 4 lines for $100 plan that
I refuse to give up. So, naturally, I cringe every time I need to upgrade my phone,
but I'm always able to work something out.

After having my iPhone stolen, I came here  to purchase a new one.
I didn't have time to wait on the insurance replacement and didn't want to change my plan and also
i wasn't sure if i was able to buy unlocked iphone on my own and use it on metro as well .
Fernando and Jonathan was extremely helpful. He explained different options Colors and GB that's offered online only via apple website.
I was able to buy iphone 12 256gb unlocked from apple website and it was
fully compatible with metro 5g networkand most importantly they helped me transfer all my data from my old iphone
and gave me a little coaching how to save battery and change network settings between 4glte and 5g
I thank you for all your patience and your Great Service ! Thank you again</review>

This metro by t-mobile store is bombdiggity!! I have been in this store 2 times and the entire staff was so friendly and helpful!! They took their time to really help me understand, activate my unlocked Iphone 12 when I purchased it from apple and brought to activate in store  and they took their time to transfer all my data from my android phone.. I went to another metro store closer to my home and they didn't even give me the time of day. I WILL ALWAYS COME BACK TO THIS STORE for any cell phone needs and I will continue to purchase any new products from them because they really care about their customers!! Fernando is the person that helped me both times and he is so patient, helpful, and remembers her customers. Thank you Fernando for taking the time to care about your customers!!< /Text>

<Text>Awesome service again by Fernando  Total complete customer service from start to finish and follow up.  I have purchased many phones , tablet from this location.  Each Sales Rep is helpful and they make you feel comfortable even asking the 'dumb question'.  Being a 50 something I had a lot of 'dumb' questions.  LOL
I just purchased a Stylo 6 today seamless fast service.  Just make sure you have your Google Id Password to complete your new phone set up.
Keep up the great customer service and I will be purchasing another Phone in a couple of weeks.  and thank you for helping my daughter with her unlocked iphone , We appreciate you !< /Text></record>

<Review>Conveniently located next to a 99cents only market
super easy to find parking. I had some issues with my bill and decided to get
it sorted out in person. Amazing Honest Sales Reps, attentive, and seemed more
than willing to help remedy the situation.
They also noticed that I was eligible for a pretty slick
upgrade add a line promtion i did not hear about elsewhere
Upgraded and Add a line , and also brought in my unlocked iphone 12
everything was done within 30 min, iphone 12 fully activated with 5g service!< /Review>< pictures>

I been here three times and I never have to wait in line!
The salesmen knows exactly what they are doing because
I always leave their store satisfied.
I am so happy to find a metro by T-Mobile store that is close to home and has
good service. and i really apreciate all your kind honest service to my self and my
family !

Not only I didn't have to stand in line,
the place was very organized and clean.
All the demo phones were working properly
so I was able to play around with it.
I been an Android user all my life so all the phones
I purchased from their store was always in stock.
I never had to come back to check-in for a back order.
And most importanly, if you have any question regarding Unlocked phone
they can verify and check 4g lte 5g compatibility with metro by t-mobile
This is good news for anyone!<//review>

They suck!  Tried to charge $70 to add a line to account in addition to my recurring monthly charge... Regular Metro store only charged $20.< /review>

I dont really leave reviews but I wanna thank Fernando for such an amazing experience,  I'm a long time customer here at this location and I have never had any issues with any of the workers, they have an amazing staff and are very professional,  this store is my favorite and I will always come here , they always help and will go the extra mile for you whether its helping me with my phone plan, getting a new device, help with small bugs and issues on my phone , this store will make sure they solve the problem for you no matter what it takes, so if you ever need help I'd suggest this store over any other metro store location!!< /Review>

<username>Arturo Gallez<//username><review>Just finished switching from cricket and I must say it was the most easiest quickest switch ever ! Reps at this location were very honest and straight to the point on which phone I qualify and the discounted plans they offer, I had a old lg stylo from cricket which had slow internet always running out of storage and I wanted to switch to metro to try out the 5g device , rep was able to offer me one plus 5g for free and helped me transfer all my data inc contacts text msg photos call logs literally everything, I've been to many cellphone stores but this is first location that offered complete data transfer , I couldn't be happier and I gotta say if anyone is looking to switch from their current carrier and you're looking for great customer service I'm gonna recommend you come here! You won't regret it</review>< user>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) I have never come to a store as friendly as this, they know what they are talking about and they have the cheapest plans and the best customer service, they helped me to get a good and cheap plan with my unlocked phone
If I recommend a subway store
Honestly come to this store
Ask for Jonathan or Fernando

Si les recomiendo una tienda de metro
Honestamente vengan a esta tienda
Pregunten por Jonathan o Fernando<//Review>

< Review>
While some people may express frustration with their packages or the service, I have to say that the agents here have pretty much always been fairly courteous and helpful when I've used their services. This service point is in an industrial area, and clearly they are fairly busy here all the time. Usually there are a couple agents on hand if you have questions and there is a self service terminal to start the process of getting a label printed and shipping out a package. Because of current health considerations, expect a wait to enter the building and complete your business.</Review>

I was suppose to get my package 3 days ago. The package was received at the Van Nuys location, at the time it was scheduled. They sent me daily messages that the package will be at my house by the end of the day. Unfortunately, I still haven’t gotten a package from them yet. This is a very important package as we’re celebrating a birthday! I already called them 4 times to try to track where the package is. If the package is still at that location, I’ll personally come and pick it up myself. They didn’t provide any answers for me and there was no contact with the driver!
I expect that a big company like this will have a better service.<//text>

< Review>
I was mailing a package off for a friend/customer of mines in Japan and the DHL Customer Service Clerk wanted me to open everything I had in the box even a sealed birthday card. They kept saying it was apart of TSA rules. I don't if it was because of COVID-19 but I felt discriminated against... And if it was because of COVID-19 they didn't wear any gloves yet they put their hands all over my stuff. A check shouldn't have been that invasive.< /Review>

<username>A’s Foster parents</username><Time>1559526805968< /Time><rate>1</rate><text>I am leaving a complaint on here only because I never received a follow up phone call regarding my complaint. I called to request my package be delivered two days later than previously planned with more than enough time for it be reviewed. Called again to double check that my package would be delivered later (mentioned both times that I would be out of town). Package was delivered a day earlier without notice (and no confirmation from company that they had gotten my message regarding later delivery date). Fortunately we decided to wait one more day before leaving. No doorbell was heard and no note was left for them. It was dark when we stepped out and noticed the package. You are a professional company and get paid to provide a service (the care of our packages) it wasn’t lost fortunately, but this isn’t the point. The point is, if I pay you to take care of my package, I expect you to honor my (and do many others’ request). I have no other choice for delivery service and my package was expensive and could’ve been stolen off my doorstep. I expect better service, please own up and do better.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

<review>DO NOT USE/DEAL WITH WHATSOEVER; Literally. the. WORST! In addition to the extremely poor online/telephone customer service provided by NUMEROUS representatives at DHL, my package has been outstanding/pending for 2 WEEKS! DHL not only LOST the package altogether, the driver was NOT wearing/using his GPS that provides tracking information, did not return to work for days, was unable to track his steps, AND SUBMITTED A BLANK SIGNATURE FOR CONFIRMATION. The process that is required to get anyone of authority or intelligence is most akin to pulling teeth from a shark - DONT WASTE YOUR TIME/MONEY/EFFORT!<//review>< Rating>

A package was sent to me from Norway it made it to Southern California in 3 days. It then sat at the DHL location in Van nuys. From Friday morning until Tuesday morning. No shipping was updated online or anything. This is a massive fail customer service is horrible. I would honestly be concerned about any package being routed through the Van nuys location. Clearly they are incompetent unprofessional and in general unqualified.< /Text>

Another Victim of their "Invalid Address" excuses. my package has been "out for delivery" for nearly a week now. Today marks my third day in a row calling them to "confirm" my address, which has always been correct, and is also nearly 200 miles from Van Nuys, where they are currently holding my package.  Customer Service is atrocious, and even worse when you call within an hour of their closing time. They just don't care about their customers AT ALL. I intend to specify on all purchases to be delivered moving forward NOT to use DHL.< /Review>

I was supposed to have a package delivered to my house yesterday. It REQUIRED a signature. No one was home, yet the driver dropped it off anyway. After calling headquarters they opened up an investigation. They got back to me this morning letting me know the steps that would be taken. Today my doorbell rings and it’s the driver. Telling me he left it under my doormat and pointed to my feet. And I said well that package required a signature so it shouldn’t have been left there and I didn’t receive it. He just shrugged his shoulders and said to report a claim. I then call headquarters back immediately and they tell me they had zero communication with the van nuys station. That they weren’t supposed to send a driver out until sending over the GPS coordinates and contacting them. The driver not only wasn’t supposed to drop it off with out a signature but also should’ve taken a picture of where he supposedly put it. Which he did not. Headquarters said that this is all against protocol and I should be hearing back from them tomorrow. I am very upset that I will more then likely have to now wait for my claim to go through, wait for my items to maybe be delivered again (if they make it), and the attitude of the driver. This is extremely unacceptable< /review>

It will take you forever to pick it up.</Text>

After a week of dealing with DHLs investigation team they finally concluded that my package which was marked delivered and required my signature was "delivered" somewhere 80 miles away from my address. Van Nuys was supposed to send a driver back to the address to validate they dropped it off at the correct address which they were adamant they did. Luckily the GPS data shows they were no where near by. Garbage company and service. Still waiting on my missing package to be recovered.

They keep saying they will call me tomorrow with an update which they never follow up on.<//Text>

<review>DHL has a very non-commonsensical approach to delivering items. If I could have a choice in what shipper my suppliers use, it would Definitely NOT be DHL.

I've been getting this canned response on my package that Van Nuys had been holding since 1 December.

Also, the customer service or robot email???... have not been replying to my responses since 12 Dec. I'd love to speak with someone at their corporate office, but good luck trying to speak with a human.

One knows a company is not very good at what they do whenever there are almost as many 1-Stars as there are 5-Stars ratings.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x80c2973653cb941b:0xda465a56950f3936<//Gmap_id></record>

Management please enforse you're driver's to be more curtious and friendly. They don't even attempt to deliver. Some of these drivers look like their under the influence. There's times u drive around and there just posted for hrs parked. This why our packages are not being delivered on time. Thank you hope it improves.... Take action's management</review>

< Review>
I have bad luck with DHL shipping service in the past years. My package was late one day or two, they are never on time. However, I don't blame their Van Nuys office or their delivery driver, it is not their fault . They have a such small network but covers almost from Southern California to Central California. From Van Nuys all the way to central coast, it is like almost three hours driving straight. I would not be happy if I am the driver. I think DHL needs set up a office in SLO county, if they want to earn our business.</Review>

<review>If I could give 0 stars I would. First of all this dhl office is trash. I paid $80 to send a jeffree star blue blood palette and important documents to my family in mexico. Shipped out April 12 arrived in Mexico April 16. DHL here never mentioned cosmetics were not allowed to ship nor did they specify that the package contained BLUE BLOOD PALETTE  AND DOCUMENTS. Today April 26 I had to hire a customs broker and pay a total of  25 thousand pesos ($1400 dollars) for the release of the documents only!!!!!! I had to pull out a loan in order to pay this money in Mexico. I could not just abandon the package because my moms Visa application/Visa interview date was in there all my info my families info literally my life and my families life were at stake. DHL did absolutely nothing to help when they messed up to start off. Shipping label on stated that a make up palette was in there so the documents were considered illegal. Oh let me clear out that I paid 25 thousand pesos for the documents only. If I wanted the pallete I had to pay another 25 thousand pesos. What a RIP off... people please dont use dhl to send anything to Mexico. Find another carrier to ship not dhl.They are scammers, robbers, thieves. I will be starting a lawsuit against this office because I was robbed and now in a loan debt which was caused by dhl. This company is by far the worst. Dont trust them.!!!!!!!!! Let me clear out they never reached out to me with an alternative or information of any kind!<//review>< Pics>

<text>The lady at the front desk is very nice and helpful, but the delivery drivers are the worst. They never actually get off the vehicle to deliver. They just drive by and say the package was undeliverable.< /text>< Date>

<Text>Fast service, but the guy there; I'm not sure his name. Seems to not care about his job working at DHL. When I came to pick up my package after requesting to be put on hold, he sluggishly came to front, next when he grabbed the package (3 metal posters from Displate-Warsaw), he threw it on the table, giving a loud *thud*. He scanned it, and handed the signature scanner. I got what I wanted, but that guy made me not want to come back and do business.</Text>< Pictures>

DON'T EVER USE DHL when you're shipping something time sensitive, not only will you get no help,  you will be told you're not special and to wait your turn because regardless of paying $600 for express you have to wait 3 day's for our system to update before we deliver your item.< /Text>

<Review>Poor customer service!  WILL NEVER USE DHL EVER AGAIN.  Their is always something going wrong with packages. Even talking to management is a waste of time because they do not know what's going on. Rude employees. I don't have to use your business service since they act like it's a privilege for me to do business with them. Don't waste your time at this DHL< /Review></record>

<user>100856765372310040512< /user><Review>(Translated by Google) It seems to me. Bad shipping agency. They do not respond for the packages delivered. The claims line or customer service for claims is of no use. They do not give you a clear solution of what happened to your package. It is sad to know that they send you something with affection from your country and it never reaches its destination.

(Original)
Me parece. Pesima agencia de envios. No responden por los paquete entregados. La linea de reclamos o atencion al cliente para reclamos, no sirve de nada . No te Dan una solucion Clara de que paso con tu paquete. Es triste saber que te envian algo con cariño desde tu pais y pues nunca llega a su Destino.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><date>1612382041197<//date>< response>

<review>The World's Food market is so much smaller than i expected, but they really do offer a lot of variety! The employees were really sweet and helpful. They were very nice. I was hoping to try the mangosteen but couldn't find any. I did take home sooner starfruit and passion fruit. It was a great experience. I'll definitely stop by again when in town.</review>< pics>

This place always had a place in my heart. I was sadden to see that home town buffet closed down but there are other shops that you can visit. While there isn't much to do here unless you need very niche things. If you need those things then look no further since their prices are cheap and you cna buy whatever you need for a low price. Not many people come here so you will have very low people and no wait times usually.<//Review>

<text>I went to the beauty supply at this location and I wanted to get a bundle of hair the hair was going to be two hundred and some so I did my research and found hair that was just a silky and beautiful online for a hundred bucks so that was the only downfall but this place has everything you need in Beauty when you go inside but if you really don't need it right away take a picture and do your online research before you pay the pretty price that you are going to be paying if you're like me< /text>< rate>

It's been awhile since I've been to a 99cents store cause not to much in there is 99 cents everything in there that you like and wanna get is 2.99 and up their products selection has changed they do have some nice stuff I would buy. They should change the sign to 99+ store. Ijs🤔<//Review>

Parking set up is inconvenient. You get stuck alot waiting for traffic and pedestrians to get the hell out of the way. Also most exits are one way turns.</Text>

<Review>The parking lot sucks. It is so HUGE. No shady trees to park under on those 100 degree days. You will burn to a crisp before you make it to 99cent only store.</Review>< Pictures>

Went to purchase an inexpensive drill. When I explained I didn't want to break the bank. The person assisting said. Well go to harbor freight. It felt like I was bothering him. So I left the store. I like home depot, and I usually have good experiences there, but I'll definitely research options.<//Text>

Went for 99cents only store. Ample parking. Very easy to get in and out. Go for 99cents only, T-shirt factory(great leggings and legging shorts), and Home Depot. I have eaten at the falafal place which was ok. Not impressed with Sears Outlet. Javen't been to other stores/food places.</review>

I was followed around the store until I asked the guy following me, until I asked the guy following me what he thought of the shirt I was thinking about buying. I didn't notice any African Americans working in the store at all.</Review>
