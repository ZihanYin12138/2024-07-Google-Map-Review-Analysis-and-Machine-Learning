I will never be renting from this place again and I 100% don’t recommend it. We waited an hour and a half for jet skis to be available to rent and during that time they didn’t at all mention their weight limit of 450lbs. Plus they stole a $20 bill from my husbands wallet that we kept with them while we were riding the jet skis. His wallet had $90 in it before we rode them and $70 when we left. We didn’t mention it to them because I’m sure they would’ve just said they didn’t. My brother and cousins weight together on the jet ski was 500lbs total and they kept flipping over and spent half the time in the water versus the jet ski because they didn’t mention their weight limit. Total idiots.</Text>

I emailed to get information and to check availability for this weekend. They emailed me back the next day and said yes there was availability and gave me a phone number to call. The phone number given to me was not even the number on their website, it was a personal cell phone number to the person who responded to my email named Brian booth. I tried to call the phone number on the website multiple times and there was no answer. I emailed again to Brian stating no one was answering and he never responded back. I then filled out their contact us form with my information again to have them contact me and no one ever did.<//text>

<Time>1563390563295<//Time><rating>2< /rating><text>I will not rent from here nor will I ever refer anyone to rent here. I requested a boat rental for a full day which I did get (only reason they are getting 2 stars). I was told to pick up the boat at 900 and the owner was running an hour late. While waiting I became skeptical as the building appears to be abandoned/falling apart and the equipment looks like trash. I stayed anyway and rented because my family was looking forward to it all week.
As previous reviewers mentioned, their website shows new well maintained jet skis and boats. THAT IS NOT WHAT YOU GET. You'll see a large selection of beat to hell POS. Granted they are a rental agency and most people who rent at mission bay have never driven a jet ski or boat before.
I met Oscar the owner who is in it for the hustle and that he does well. I can see where others found him to be aggressive or intimidating as he tried to be with me for being 10 minutes late (couldn't hook the trailer up because well its a POS). I rented to 10 seat Yamaha and it ran. that is about it.
In the end I wont be coming back ever.
There are plenty of garage renters or other agencies out there that will treat you much better and provide a better product.</text>< Pics>

Unfortunately there was an acident on the Hwy preventing me from being early.\nBut we did set up a hour early pick up for you. Yet you still complain I tried to accommodate you in every possible way. You complained you lost an hour of riding time, so I allowed you to keep it an extra hour past closing, Still not Happy with the early pickup, late return, I also let you use the Tow Tube for free.\nThen you complain the boat is not the same color as pictured on my advertising and that it's not in pristine condition. Well it is a rental unit, that is used by hundreds of renter's thruout the year. You got your wife's permission to rent it and still complain not good enough, even at hundreds of dollars cheaper then the competition.\nThe boat and Jet Ski are all inspected for safety and servisability.\nThere might have been some jet skis in the yard that other renter's crashed, but definitely not anything being rented prior to some fiberglass repair being done. Oscar is the last person to hustle anyone, look at all the other reveiws for credibility and praise.\nYou where not 10 min late, we close at 5 allowed you to return at 6, you showed up at 645,  if I remember correctly , still wanted time to go buy gas to fill up the boat, so you weren't charged $5 per gallon, because you didn't bother to bring boat back full of gas like received. When you left , you had nothing but praise and appreciation. Then get home and decide to make up this story.\nSome customers will never appreciate all that is done for them. Please rent elsewhere next time. Better for both of us 😉"}<//resp>

If you have never done this before or don't have experience driving a truck and trailer, this could definitely not be an easy task. All in all it was pretty straight forward and we had a blast. The jet skis themselves ran well and we had no problems with them. And I was even able to call the location while on the water to have my time extended. Would go to again.</review>< pics>

Just got finished returning the two wave runners we rented. Seriously the best place to rent in San Diego. I never write reviews but I came on here because I'm so appreciative. Very friendly and understanding that our friend lost his keys and we were a bit late returning the equipment and gas. It might not be on the water but it is no inconvenience at all; you get ALL DAY for the same price as only 4-hour rentals from other places.</Text>

I was told to call by friday, the day before my reservation, if I needed to cancel. I had a ton of work come up, so ended up having to do so. I called three times and finally got someone to answer.. she was very short and rude to begin with. I explained that I left a message earlier, and didn't know if someone had already gotten it.. she replied "I can take your reservation"...

I explained, I actually needed to cancel a reservation.. sounding completely shocked, "your CANCELING?!"...  she asked which day, I told her... I asked If I'd get some kind of confirmation. She said "for what?! we haven't charged you". I explained just that it had been canceled so I knew it wouldn't look like a no-show and bill me anyway. her reply, "You're talking to me right now".. as if that was confirmation enough...

I asked if she was the manager.. she said "I'm the chief operating officer".. I told her "I feel like you're being very short, and rude with me, and I don't understand why" ... her response "have a good day" and hung up!!

They had great prices, excellent service, allowed us to borrow a vehicle to take the skis to the water. All day was $200 plus gas, no one could touch that price. No issues everything ran perfect, family loved it, hung out on the beach and took turns on the ski all day. Got to try it !!</Text>

Worst experience ever!  Renter beware!  This business shows you photos of well maintained jet skis but what you get our poorly maintained pieces of junk about to break down.  You take it because you have planned your day and then when you bring the jet ski back, they hit you with a bunch of repair bills (you must sign their repair contract).  So instead of costing you $200 a day, you now paid $644 for the day.  They quoted me $150 extra charge for a broken handle and then charged my credit card three times that amount.  DO NOT USE THIS DISHONEST BUSINESS or suffer the consequences.  While renting the party before got stuck with an extra $350 of repair charges.  Basically the renter is paying for maintenance.<//review>

Used this place twice, a few years ago.

Jetski rental price is great.  Even with the lowest end jetski, 2 young men had fun on the 2-up.  Mission bay is fun.

Only issue is getting the watercraft to the water.  We had to use our truck (or theirs) to tow the jetski into the water.  There is a very close and large boat launch, just south of the place.

Not sure if they have a transport/towing service to bring the watercraft to water for you, but if they did they get more business.<//Review>

Daniel was friendly, professional, and knowledgeable. You can't beat the price, and its located around the corner from the marina. He gave us plenty of time to get there and back, and included a truck and tow at no extra charge. The wave-runner was well-maintained and we had a great time. I'll definitely be back!<//review>

loved the rides we had last week and the 4th of July special we signed up for is far less than any other company for this weekend. The last time we rented last week it was great and the service was very professional and kind.

<text>Came for the 4th, things where a little crazy, but understandable due to the Holiday. Rented two Jet Skis, With absolutely no issues.
Ran the whole day, they provided an additional 5 gal tank of gas in case we needed it. We did. They offer to fill our Jet Skis back up after the rental, $5 per gal for the VIP Service, well worth it, when you consider the extra time you get to continue riding instead of refilling the Ski. Family Loved it. We rented by the day, set up at Ski Beach, took turns driving the Skis all day. Basically works out to be around $300 a day with gas, Thats is $37 Per Hour. UNBEATABLE,</text><pics>None< /pics>< gmapID>

Do not rent from these crooks! Charged $100 for a minor paint chip less then 1cm x 1cm. You're a rental business! It happens!

Advertised price might be one of the cheapest in the area, but it does not take into consideration gas for the jet ski. They give you the keys for a truck and ski trailer to drive to the bay where you have to put in and take out the skis yourself. I could live with all that, however when we came back they totally scammed us out of our deposit, stating there was damage to the ski that we caused! We took very good care of them! Even if it was caused by us, it was a very minor paint chip that they charged us $100 for!! IT'S PART OF THE RENTAL GAME! Don't download your costs onto me.< /Review>

I am just appalled with the fact that this place is even allowed to be in business When we got there, the guy was either being rude or perhaps he just laked in people skills. I figured the second. Normally I would have  said something. But I just decided to brush it off my shoulders since I had my family with me on vacation. So as I see the jet ski the seats are slightly torn with a few scuff marks on the Jet Ski. I immediately brought it to the attention of the guy. I wanted to make sure I wouldn't get charged for that damage.  He said it was fine. fast forward a week later the payment for the deposit posted so I called to see why. They said I was responsible for the damage. NOW I ASKED BEFORE WE TOOK THE JET SKIS OUT!!! And they still tried to keep my money. Thank god my Credit Card company was able to dispute the charges.

<review>They seem good at first but BUYER BEWARE these people are thieves. They will definitely try and keep some if not all of your DEPOSIT no doubt. I would not recommend this business to anyone. Look at the posts below and see how they use tape and paste to SCAM.</review>< Pictures>

<Text>It's a rip off the rent is cheap
But as soon as you come back they will start inspecting every inch Of the ski even the smallest scratches they will charge you a lot of money
I end up paying 300$ dollars for I don't even know.
Because before you take the jet ski nobody tells you that if there would be a small scratch or anything you will pay a lot of money
Plus it's far from the bay and the gave us an old disgusting truck and they told Us to take and bring back the ski by our selves
I wouldn't recommend this Place to nobody<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>{'time': 1456510287126, 'text': 'You and I inspected the ski prior to your rental, we marked all previous damages, we inspected it together before hand and after the rental, you where shown the damages and are 100% responsible according to the rental contract you signed and agreed to.'}< /resp>< gmapID>

I think all you need to do is read the owner's responses to bad reviews to know everything you need to know about this place. Buyer beware is right (someone else wrote this in their review). Please go somewhere else. The short version of my experience is this: We rented out jet skis for 2 hours, brought them back and the owner charged us $50 for bogus damage fees. The person who did our inspection with us mysteriously disappeared and was unavailable to dispute the damage. We did not damage the jet skis, plus if we had done it, it would have cost more than $50 to fix the scuff the owner claims we made. Anyway, he argued and argued and was unprofessional until we finally just paid it so we could leave. He also charged the two groups we saw check out before and after us additional damages. With the conditions his equipment is in, he can't possibly be able to tell if there is additional damage. Anyway, after our experience,  I wrote a bad Yelp review. About 3 weeks later, I got my credit card bill and was charged an additional  $1,000 from them. This was not a deposit fee or pending reversal how some places do, but an actual charge. My credit card company asked me to contact the business first to see if they would reverse the charge. When I called, I spoke to the owner, who said,  aren't you the one who wrote a bad Yelp review? If you delete it, we will look into your dispute faster.

I couldn't believe it. I ended up getting the charges reversed after I submitted my receipts to my credit card company,  but do yourself a favor and go somewhere else please.< /Review>

<Text>Terrible service! They make you tow the Jetski to the water yourself! The woman behind the counter started screaming at me because I asked her if she had already charged my card. Also, they charge a deposit fee of $500 per JetSki, which they said take 18 days to return to your account, sounds shady. The other place just took a copy of my card without charging anything. When I asked people around the area if they had heard of this place, they responded that they got shutdown TWICE already! PLEASE DO NOT GO HERE! YOU WILL RUIN YOUR DAY! THE ATTITUDE OF THE WORKERS IS TERRIBLE, THEY TREAT YOU LIKE GARBAGE!</Text><Rate>1<//Rate><response>{'time': 1533885288026, 'text': "So where is the terrible service, you're claiming. Obviously you got our number from the website which clearly explains our business operating procedures. If you don't like them go elsewhere !!! We did not do anything wrong, we have been in business almost 20 years, and NO NEVER BEEN SHUT DOWN, UNLIKE YOUR STATEMENT. We have the largest fleet in San Diego, and can honestly say the biggest customer base.\nYes we are not on the water, so the jet skis need to be trailered. Unfortunately city law dictates it ileagal for any business to deliver jet skis to Mission Bay or San Diego Bay. We do not make you do anything, we offer jet skis at an much more affordable rate than the competition, probably the exact reason you tried to rent from us 🤗 it was your choice to rent or not. It was also explained, if YOU choose to use a debit or credit card for your damage deposit, it would take 5-15 days for YOUR credit card provider to release the hold, Just Like At A Hotel or Rental Car Agency ( WE DONT RECEIVE FUNDS OR HOLD FUNDS ) I only know of one company that is crazy enough to not require a Deposit on their Jet Skis. The only thing that sounds shady, is your account of what happened, why would anyone yell at you for asking if we ran your card, Let get real !! Maybe you gave a little attitude is my thought. Not sure if your just my jelous competition or a real customer, but your facts seem to be pretty farfetched.  If we actually did something wrong or shady, or out of the norm. By all means let the world know. But don't think I will not rebut your BS and Lies. Glad to see you found someone else to provide service to you."}<//response>< user_name>

Way to much fun for one weekend.  We went out on a muggy, hot San Diego day and nothing could of been more refreshing then being out on the bay on Jet Skis.  Great time and reasonable prices.  Great for a date!  I had Sea Doos when I was young, so this was like a blast from the past.<//Review>

<review>DO NOT GO HERE. Worst people I've ever had to deal with. Jet ski didn't work from the time I got out on the water. Spoke with the owner about this issue and he had the situation like the D head he is, and never gave me a refund for his broken machinery. I highly recommened going to any other jet ski rental. This place was as an absolute joke and it starts with the ownership. Save your time and money and don't go here<//review>< username>

<Text>The jet ski was old and had engine problems, and when the engine went out in the middle of the water, even when the jet ski did not flip, they replaced the jet ski but still charged us for an engine repair, even though it was not our fault. They cover the jet ski with duct tape and grade paste and when you go in the water the tape and paste fall off making it seem like you caused the damage and they will charge you off of pre-existing damage. They charged us for over a thousand dollars for damage that most of it was not our fault and to repair the engine that was already broken. I felt that is how they make money, by tricking people into these extra repair charges. We walked out with paying over $1,000 extra (besides the rental cost) for unnecessary charges.< /Text>< Pictures>

Yes we do tape damage that has not been repaired yet, so as to keep the Jet ski looking clean and smooth. It is $60 a roll tape that DOES NOT FALL OFF !!!. In addition to the tape all previous damages are marked with a silver pen to show damages caused by other customers not you. The second Jet Ski that "YOU" damaged, had the side off the Jet Ski crashed into the corner of a dock, MORE THAN OBVIOUSLY FRESH AND CAUSED WHILE IN YOUR POSSESION. Everything you where charged and all the charges that I did not charge you for, where agreed to and approved by yourself on the rental contract.

I rented a jet ski and an inner tube from this business on 5/16/15. This was a one hour rental. The innertube deflated on the water after only 2 rides. I then called the business to notify them but continued our jet ski rental for the remainder of the hour. Upon returning the jet ski and innertube, the owner demanded that I pay $75 for the deflated tube. There was an obvious defect of the tube at the seam where the plastic split. I refused to accept the charge for a new tube and the owner told me that I was "suspicious" and screamed at me. I then told him not to yell or to look at me while being condescending and he physically intruded my personal space and threatened me while yelling at me. I told him that I was going to call the police because I felt this argument was going to result in a fist fight. He then backed down and walked away. I have NEVER in my life been treated so poorly by a person, or a business. He was boorish, rude, unreasonable, and THREATENED A CUSTOMER WHILE SCREAMING. He still charged my credit card for the extra $75, which I will now have to dispute because he CHARGED ME FOR A DEFECTIVE RENTAL.< /Text>

<review>This place is absolutely terrible. The heavy guy at the front is very mean, not very professional and a thief, this business is a big scam. He puts customers on speaker phone while calculating chargers for others, asks customers to call him back saying he's busy in a rather rude way. Honestly, the only thing I liked when I first walked in was their cute dog, only nice thing about the place. They require a 500 dollar deposit per jet ski and we got two, so there was a 1000 dollar deposit needed. If you borrow a truck, they require you to take the jet skis to the bay, return the truck, and then drive back which surprisingly takes more time than one would think. They even forgot to give us life jackets =.= . When we returned they claimed we damaged a jet ski and showed us a small crack, more like a little chip in the fiber glass on the side. We left an iPad in one of the trucks and when going the next day to get it back they claimed it was going to cost us $750!!!! Absolute thieves. When one of us claimed they would here from our lawyer the heavy man at the front then refused to return our iPad!!! The owner came out and wasn't so nice himself but made the man at the front desk return our iPad. There are many other jet ski rental places nearby, definitely go to another, i wish i did. This place, the guys there, awful.</review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80dc01c120941e61:0x9de503390ff236cc<//gmap_id></record>

Jet ski I rented seemed old, it was having issues starting after we rode for a while, but eventually started. You have to drive to the launch spot, and fill the gas in the jet ski if you dont want to be charged $5.00/gallon for their gas. Friendly staff, seemed family owned.< /text>

Excellent . Me and my friends went to San Diego JetSki rentals for spring break. We rented two Jetske's for $400 for all day ,excellent deal.  Mission bay was a little cold but we had a great time. The Jetske's ran great no issues. Backing the Jetske's into the water was a little scary , but they gave us instructions on how to do it it was not that hard. The Asian lady in the office was very friendly but the guy who gave the safety brief was a little too serious. Overall it was a great experience we all had a lot of fun except for Allison who got sunburned. We will be back when it gets warmer.<//Review>

Hello please be warned please read the other reviews.  I was naïve to read all the reviews of this place. I saw the decent prices and thought that would be a good idea to come here .when I called I was greeted by an angry Asian lady she was nasty when I asked her about the prices of the Jetskis and the gas. I thought she was having a bad day so I stopped by anyway . I filled out the waivers and watch the video and I signed my life away on those papers. I thought it was weird when they just toss me the keys to the truck  with a trailer attached to it with the Jetskis. The JetSki's were extremely old and faded . One of our JetSki's the gauges didn't work . They told me they weren't  busy so they said I can keep the truck at the lot.  When we were putting the Jetski's in the water I saw a bunch of  alittle marks on the Jetski. They mark your JetSki with a silver sharpie around the damage .  So we rode around for a hour and half. We loaded up the Jetskis back into the trailer and took it back to the shop.  They nitpick the Jetskis but couldn't find any damage to it.  So when we were all done and we were about to leave they claimed that we damage the truck bumper and their trailer.   The worker kept trying to tell us to just say that we did it and it would ended up being cheaper then our deposit.  The owner  called us liars and said he to take both of our $500 deposits [1000$] for Bumper on an old GMC truck that is rusted and trashed.  The Please read the views the this is a fraud and takes a advantage of people. Go somewhere else that cost more  money because they make there money on false damage charges .< /Text>

I took my jet ski in to be repaired. After a week, no diagnostic had been performed. Another week later I decide to visit the shop in person and check on the jet ski. Still no diagnostic had been performed. I told them I will return tomorrow and if you have not performed a diagnostic I will take the Jet Ski 2 another shop. Sure enough I returned and no one had even removed the seat from the ski. To make matters worse they left it uncovered for more than two weeks in the sun. Thanks sd jetski now my seat is faded and you never even serviced my ski. Don't go here they are a bunch of rude hacks. Nothing but excuses,  no apology, and no remorse.  I'm calling the bbb.</Review>

San Diego Jet Ski Rentals has not been open this year at all. So either someone is impersonating my business, or someone is renting jet skis without my knowledge. Either way any info you could provide me would be much appreciated. Our old location was at 4365 Mission Bay Dr, in front of a hotel. If this is not where you rented, I would like to know where, if someone is really using my business name, and any other info you could provide. It looks like we are both business owners, so I am hoping you will let me know something. If you have us confused with another company, maybe you could apply the bad review to the correct company. Oscar, a big mexican dude is the only person who you would have got a jet ski from if it was SD Jet Ski Rentals. Thank you , do hope to hear back from you.'}</resp>< Text>
Do not go there.the worst place you could rent a jet ski from. rude people, the owner was so disrespectful  to us claiming that we damaged the jet engine and charged us $250 on top of the rents money.the jet stopd in the water didn't know what to do! bad experience.we kept telling him that we are not paying for a bad engine that should be maintained daily up untill he came off on us cursing and calling us names.waste of time!< /Text>

These people are crooks! If I could give a 0 out of 5 I would...

When we called the day before to make our reservation they stated that they would drop off the jet skis and bring it back but when we got there it was a whole different story... We had to take one of their trucks drop it off then bring the truck back and then go to the place take the truck and bring back the jet skis... Also when we brought back the skis they apparently had to charge us $50 just because we had the jet ski a little bit close to shore even thought the ski was completely off with no engine running in which they did not state that the skis should not be put close to chore while they are off. SO I ended up going to get my final bill in which I was in a rush so when I got in the car I looked at the receipt and saw that they had charged me an extra $100 for (damage to bottom) which they had not told me about and the jet skis were not damaged at all... Even though this place is significantly cheaper than everyone else don't be fooled. This place shouldn't be allowed to be in business  much rather rent from somewhere else and pay the higher prices, also there was 3 other unhappy customers who had the same problem as ours at the same time which means they did this with all of their customers!<//text>

{'time': 1473877148486, 'text': '16 years in business, we never deliver Jet Skis, our web site is very clear. IT IS A CITY ORDINACE< THAT PREVENTS US FROM DELIVERING< NOT OUR CHOICE !!  If you called and made a reservation you where told prior to the reservation how everything worked. Everything comes on a trailer ready for you to tow, if you need a truck to tow them we provide it for free. I give the safety brief, in my brief I tell you no less than six times to keep the Jet Ski in waist deep water, do not beach the Jet Ski, and how to use the Anchor bag provided to keep the Jet Ski\'s safe and damage free. Then to top it off, ""YOU"" sign the back of the rental agreement agreeing that the Jet Ski must stay waist deep at all times running or not, of you will be fined $50 per ski per incident. This is done to protect my Jet skis from hull damages and Jet Pump Damages, all of which happen in shallow water !! So if you did get charged $50 per ski X 2 Jet Skis, it was because we went to the beach , took pictures of you showing complete disregard to all rules, advice and directives and not caring about my equipment. There was issues with other customers, but theirs issue was actual damages to the ski from impact. So you might see a little difference in your side of the story to ours, maybe even a BIG difference !!!'}< /response>

<Review>Overall a solid experience here. They provided me with the jetski and the truck to launch the jet ski myself. I was in and out in about 25-30 minutes (had to watch an orientation video,  fill out a form, then go over a safety brief/ inspection of the jetski). The price is really fair for what you get. Just a heads up that they charge for the gas you use at the end when you return the jetski (I don't think I saw this mentioned on the website) but it's a very fair price. I paid $10 for an hours worth of gas and I was going at around 48mph. Definitely recommend these guys. I took care of my jetski so my hold on my card came back to me. Solid place for sure.

< Review>
ABSOLUTE CROOKS. My friend and I were on vacation and decided we would rent a jet ski for the day.  We called and reserved a jet ski for the day.  On the phone we found out that we have to put the jet ski in the water ourselves and take it out.  They told us if we didn't have a vehicle to tow it, they had loaner vehicles available.  We thought this was very unconventional, but we went along with it.  When we got there we had to wait for the guy to finish with the people before us.  Then they showed us a safety video and went over how to put the jet ski in and out of the water.  They then had us look over the jet ski and told us that everything that has white tape over it, they know about and is ok.  Anything with silver marker on it is ok and they know about it.  Any other damage you find that you can find that can catch with your fingernail you need to inform them of.  We looked it over and found a few scratches that we showed them.  Since we were just visiting the city for a short amount of time, we didn't have rental car, so we used a loaner truck.  Just as we were getting in the truck, they asked if we had a place to put the gas can of spare gas for the jet ski when we got there and we said no, just the truck, and that's when they told us that after we put the jet ski in the bay, we need to bring them the truck and trailer back and then walk back to the bay.  Then after we were done jet skiing, we would have to walk back to the rental place to pick up the truck and trailer and drive it back to the bay and pick up the jet ski and take it back.  Now the walk was only a 10-15 minute walk, but still inconvenient.  We had fun on the jet ski, aside from the intake continuously clogging with very little seaweed and requiring clean out.  The jet skis speedometer also did not work, which they said they already knew and had just neglected to tell us.  When we were finished riding we walked back, got the truck and trailer, and took the jet ski back.  They then inspected it and filled it back up with gas, that we were charged for!  Your rental fee does not include any gas!  At this point we had paid $250 for the rental, and $37.50 for gas.  Then they said, "well it looks like your all set, except for some damage back here."  Our heads immediately shot up because we didn't know of any damage.  We hadn't hit anything or been hit by anything on the water, and it was a cloudy day so aside from 2 other jet skiers that we never crossed paths with, we were alone on the water.  They showed us a crack in the fiberglass on the side in the back right before the back corner of the platform that you board the jet ski from.  He said it needed repair because it was taking on water.  The only problem was, THE CRACK WAS LINKED TO PRE-EXITING DAMAGE!!!  I saw the 2 cracks disappeared underneath a piece of tape, and said those aren't our fault, they are connected to these cracks under this piece of tape that you said was fine.  They then peeled back the tape and the cracks we were accused of were part of the cracks under the tape.  The cracks didn't even like just like make a turn and connect to the original ones, they were fluent right off the end of the ones covered by the tape.  They were not separate cracks, they were the same crack!!!  They said we need to show the owner.  They then said that this crack in the fiber glass wouldn't have just spread, it would have required a strike by something or that we had to have done something to it.  There was no evidence of anything hitting it.  I told them that it probably cracked more because it is the side of the boarding platform, and us getting on and off of the jet ski would have put pressure there and that might cause the crack to expand, but it is from pre-existing damage. We cant help that.  They then said since it is liked to pre-exiting damage, we are only going to be charged a quarter of the repair cost which is $100.00  That is ridiculous!  We shouldn't have to pay anything for a crack that they knew existed when it left! We will never go back to this establishment and neither should you.</Review>

In the beginning they were so friendly, the time you put the deposit and return the jet ski they just want to get any problem just to take your money..
first problem: they think that you are a jetski rental guy to know where to look for damages because they've found a damage that no one would of search for it.
second problem : they gave me an really old truck to drop the jetski on the beach and They told me that I broke the gear How can I brake the gear if I am only dropping the jetski and give it to them back in less than 30 minutes
Third problem: they charged me 100$ for late fee while they gave me an broken gear truck which took me too long to use it
Fourth: their jetski are not that good as the other places

You may think that their jet ski is cheap to rent but trust me you pay too much for non seenable dames

dont waist your time and money with them go find somewhere else< /text>

More expensive than your casual supermarket, but this place has both good variety and really quality products. They tend to not stock many common brand name products, but instead have healthier alternatives. Great service and quality overall.<//text>

<review>Expensive for sure, but very good social distancing and disinfecting practices.

Update May 18:  Today I paid $6.50 for a lb of Mary's chicken thighs.  2 days ago we bought the same product from Whole Foods for $3 and and a few cents.  Under $3 at Safeway.

This store has now been relegated to "emergency use only".   I don't care how convenient it might be.  Throwing away money like that is lunacy.<//review>< Pictures>

Great selection of non dairy products that include, cheese, sour cream, butter, cream cheese, and non dairy milk options. I would love to see more ice cream options. I think they only have two or three to pick from for the lactose intolerant folks. Oh, and how can I forget?! They have a great wine selection and the wine buyer was super helpful and informative on their wine selection.</text>

A quaint grocery store in bernal heights. If you're looking for cheap and cheerful this isn't the place for you. They stock mostly organic produce so prices of items are slightly more expensive than other places. That being said they have a giant array of cheeses that you won't see elsewhere.< /Text>

I've been shopping here for many years. There's a great selection of products at prices that are very reasonable for a relatively small store. I especially appreciate the organically grown produce and bulk food bins. Also, the staff and manager(?), Frankie are friendly and very helpful. I couldn't ask for a better neighborhood market.<//text>

<Review>Little bit of everything, clean, busy as the 5pm rush came in. Could definitely do lunch or dinner on the quick. Very visible Guard presence x2 so I guess there may be some other issues. If you have a plan for food on the go this place should have what you need.<//Review>< user>

The perfect size for a high quality neighborhood supermarket. It has the right amount of products in each category and they even serve good hot food if you don't feel like cooking. The wine selection isn't bad either and the cheeses are definitely worth trying. Only bad experience was with a tamales from the food counter, otherwise great place!</Text>

Just a solid community grocery. They hub the whole downtown of Bernal really. Prices are... fine. Certainly less expensive than whole foods.  I wish the meats and fish more inspired but I only go to other stores once in a while so good life really does serve me and the community very well. I'm glad they are here.< /text>

Clean, friendly store with great staff. Lots of organic and gourmet options. Short lines; efficient service. Great produce. It's a little small and some things are expensive, so it's (unfortunately) still necessary to go down the street to Safeway once in a while.</review>

I like the variety of products this market offers! Very expensive but good products!
I would give this business a 4 star but unfortunately today  my mind changed about this place after I witness one of its employees (tall , white man) who works behind the counter at the meat market and the deli .. ( it’s all prestou much together in o e area of the market) blow his nose  using his hands and a little piece of a nanpkin right on top of the food at the counter ! ( ham, bacon, turkey...) and then  without  washing his hands he went right away and started to hand food  and packing the meats !! I stopped right there and observe him ! It made me sick on my stomach and unfortunately this person is definitely not thinking of  contamination , passing around germs and getting people sick!
Please if you hand food think about others and wash ur hands!!<//text>

<Rate>1</Rate><text>I’m African American. I’ve lived in Bernal for 33 years. I shop at the Good Life Grocery on Cortland, several times a week.
I have notice that every time I check out, several of the cashiers don’t say hello or thank me for shopping there. But, when I’m standing behind a caucasian shopper or just in front of one, they jump to say hello and never forget to thank them for shopping there. This is not a one time experience it happens more often than not. And, I’m almost embarrassed to point out,  it’s usually the Latino cashiers who commit this offense. The next time I’m in your store and this happens I will point this out and will continue to point this out until it is acknowledged and dealt with by management. I think it’s obvious to the offenders but they don’t seem to care about my experience at your store. They will even hold a casual conversation with another employee, as to not make eye contact with me or even address me. They seem to look pass me.  I don’t know why. But, I will start to point that out with each transaction.
Please, talk to your staff and explain that, thought my face is Black, my money is just as green. I’m not looking for a friend just to be treated equally.
Thank you< /text>< Pics>

<Text>Good Life has a great selection of food for a small grocer. I always leave and think... "I can't believe I just spent $80 on one bag of groceries." But that's not the point with your local grocer. If I want a super good deal on groceries I go to Trader Joe's, but Trader Joe's isn't in the heart of Bernal with a community-minded friendly neighborhood grocery store are they? Staff is always helpful, cashiers are always friendly. The manager who is always whirling around the place makes me smile.

Things I am super grateful they carry:
Schwarz hot links sausage
Rotisserie Chicken
Strauss Creamery organic milk

***I am desperately looking for the white snow leopard of ice creams: Ben and Jerry's Mission to Marzipan... Good Life, you would be my #1 grocer of all time if you could bring that snow leopard in!!!***<//Text><Rate>5</Rate><gmap_id>0x808f7e59661d8615:0x4c00c9b5c712a490< /gmap_id><Name>Nalani Ngoon Warde<//Name></record></dataset><record>

I went here to pick up "emergency" shirts that I would normally buy online.  Knowing I can get the same shirts for a 1/4 of the price from my web source is why I wouldn't normally shop here.</Text>

Hispanic guy at from desk has disgusting behavior. Very overpriced. Do not reccomend.
Simple hoodie for $8-10 they sell for $35. Plus $20 extra for print. They out of their mind. How do they stay in business....< /Review>

This place have great cheap prices. They even do your designs for you for any of your shirts and hats or whatever.  Pretty nice to just go there to buy some cheap shirts for any teams of sports you may want on it or just for yourself.< /text>

<text>Have been buying shirts from the T Shirt Wharehouse for many years. Never had a problem. Good products at a fair price. Reviews that have less then 5 stars were written by frustrated people that like to tell lies.</text>< Pics>

{'time': 1536518653597, 'text': 'First, I am sorry for the inconvenience. We reprinted every shirt that was printed incorrectly. It is unreasonable demand to ask for all the wrong printed t-shirts for free to take.\nbecause we have already made all the shirts and given them to you.  And you took it.\nIf you are worried about something else, ask for incorrect shirt to be disposed of rather than asking for free to take.\nSometimes we make mistakes. However, we always correct the mistake and print again to make it as customer wants. In addition, the wrong printed shirt should be disposable and not given to the customer.\nWhat you are worried about is that we are trying to sell the shirt?  If you want, we can dispose of it in front of you.\nOnce again, I am sorry for the inconvenience.'}</response>

Pedro printed the wrong image, my personal graphic that I created on the tshirts i purchased from tshirt warehouse I provided them w two images and received a print out of the graphic to be used. They used the wrong graphic. I had to come back several times to pick up the tshirt losing a lot of valuable time. Then instead of giving me the image, my image, he wanted to sell it to me. So now, they have my personal graphic which I was trying to protect in their store and refused to destroy it. When I asked to speak to the owner, he wouldn't provide the information. Do not go here if you want to protect your rights to images you create. They don't care.

I do not trust that they discarded my images on the tshirts or shredded them. When I say " my image" it is literally my photo with my logo on the tshirt that I designed. They said the tshirts would be used as rags, but unless I see them cut up in front of me, Pedro or any employee of Tshirt warehouse could sell the tshirt with my physical image on it. or take them home. If they were going to destroy the tshirt as stated, they would have done it in front of me w scissors, but they refused claiming my image on that tshirt was their property now. I will sue tshirt warehouse or Pedro or whomever for keeping my physical image wo my consent and wo proof that it was destroyed. It is absurd that I had to take off work early and spend time and gas to come to tshirt warehouse and get the correct image reprinted. The time in lost wages, gas and time well exceeds the cost of the 4 tshirts that they printed incorrectly. Worst customer service and illegally keeping my physical image against my wishes.</Text>

Went here a bunch of times recently to get several different orders printed into t-shirts and they are close by.  The staff seem as though they dislike their jobs.  Each time I felt like I was inconveniencing them.  Prices not that great.  I won't go back.</review>

I am a regular customer at Thirsty's Sports Pub. The place is nice, clean bathrooms. The owners are nice. I don't watch sports but they always put the car shows on for me to watch.<//Review>

But the owner paul and his wife are 2 amazing people. They have done a out standing job of remodeling this place its really nice. I love the fact they are ufc fans as i am as well. Paul always has the fights on. Oh and they have amazing bartenders my favorite is Crystal she is a gun slinger when it comes to slinging drinks. She is beauriful super friendly & on top of her game at all times one hell of a great bartender. I think with a little advertisement this could be one jumping place ive seen a lot of cool things in this place.  they have really clean bathrooms. Ive been here a hand fool of times ive seen live dj with karaoke they offer lot of activities such as darts games and pool tables.they even have a nice private smoking pattio area out back. So with this being said i highly recommend this place to anyone that has not been to Thirsty's< /Review></record>

Well deserved 5 star. First off fast and friendly service. The portions were pretty big and filled us up. Not to mention that their prices were reasonable for the food. Recommend this place and check it out!< /text>

<resp>None< /resp><Text>My favorite Thai food in town! Such a nice little place in a great plaza and has plenty of parking. The service is awesome. They really take care of you. I always get the Yellow Curry and Pad Thai with a Thai Iced Tea. Great to share and will still have left overs. Their curry is perfectly thick and spiced. I've tried other places in the area and nothing beats this service and quality!< /Text>< user_id>

<text>Well you got a lot of choices with Chinese food I'm a chicken and fried rice kind of guy so they work for me prices are not out of line you need to call ahead if not they're going to have you waiting outside. But everyone seems to be nice and the food is good Park is a little funny but usually you can get a spot right up front near the door. And plus there's a 7-Eleven a couple of steps away if you need some diversion.</text>< response>

We were here for lunch (6 perspns). We recommend this place. The amount of salt, fat and sugar in the food had good balance. The staff were very helpful and kind.

Pad Thai, with extra vegetables. Tom yum soup. Vegetable curry, Red snapper with veggies. Vegetarian spicy basil and Beef and broccoli are traditional Thai food you can eat here.

The reason for why not 5 stars is because they gathered/kept all the plates, glasses, leftovers foods and utensils that they clean from the tables - just next to our table which was no a good sight and experience to see.<//text>

I️ had their combo, it came with orange chicken, fried rice, and an egg roll. The flavor in the chicken was amazing! I️ wanted more after my first bite. The fried rice was really good too, great flavor! The customer service was great, everyone was super nice and on top of their job.  I️ definitely recommend this place!!!!<//text>

Paid $12 for the lunch combo, which was supposedly the lunch special...didn't come with the egg rolls, which were advertised...very overpriced...$8 for a small soup!! Are you kidding me? Food quality was not good and not authentic enough for the price asked - one of the low quality Thai spots I have been to, and I have had Thai all over the place from Los Angeles to OC and the Valley.< /review>

This is a nice place with good service from Rio our server. she is actually from England area and is very polite and knowledgeable of the menu. We came on the Sunday night and enjoyed the garlic mushrooms for $6 and the pints for $7. Smithwick's and Newcastle are on tap and are delicious!</Text>

I really like this place - solid Thai food, very fast and nice service. I frequently go for lunch and I love the drunken noodles and the lunch special that includes soup, a salad and a little appetizer with the entree is very reasonable. Haven't had a bad thing here and was introduced to the avocado shake here. sounds odd, but it was delicious and very refreshing.<//Text>

I've ordered food from this restaurant several times now and have never had a bad experience. Even if I was told there would be a wait as long as an hour, I still received my food in a shorter amount of time and the food was always hot and fresh. My favorites are anything with the spicy chili sauce like the Pad Kee Mow or Spicy Spaghetti. I love the egg rolls with sweet and sour sauce as well.<//text>

Only Thai spot I go to. Shrimp pad Thai w steamed rice. Delicious! Small and quaint atmosphere. Fish tank to the left upon entry. Friendly staff and reasonable prices. Little secret, you tend to get more pad Thai when you dine-in.< /text>

I order from here frequently because their yellow curry is amazing. I have ordered it over a dozen times the same way, very mild. They never dissappoint until today. Instead if mild, my curry was very spicy. It even looked different from when I usually order it. It was a much deep, darker yellow and SPICY.
I called the restaurant to complain. They took my name and number because they had to talk to the kitchen first. Called me back 10 minutes later to tell me "that's the mildest we can make it". I know this is not the case because I have eaten the same thing there over a dozen times. Not sure if they have a new cook in kitchen or what is going on?
I am giving 1 star for lack of consistency. However, they did refund my money.< /review>

Been coming here for a couple of years, great food and great service. Food is fresh and they offer delivery. It is also across the st. from Three Weavers Brewery, very convenient for appetizers while you enjoy a few. The fried chicken, spicy fried rice and yellow curry are my favorites. The mango sticky rice is a great dessert option as well.</Review>

I really liked this place. Very tasty food. Not bland or greasy.  The crab rice was fantastic.  It is better to go with a group of people that way you can try more types of dishes.< /Review>

< Review>
I'm working from home today, because I am still sick from the food I ordered from Chana Thai last night.

What kind of greasy, bland, overcooked, diarrhea inducing mess was that, Chana Thai?   I have only ever had one food delivery experience worse than this one  - and that was when an UberEats driver backed me in to a corner and screamed in my face.

I've ordered from here once before - the food was just okay.  Nothing notably good or bad; but delivery was free and timely, and the food was edible.  Last night I placed an order around 8:10 pm.  They close at 9:30  maybe it was too late?   Delivery was supposed to take 45 - 60 minutes.  It took nearly 90.  That's fine.  Sometimes things take longer than expected.  The one-star review is, not for the food that was 30 minutes late.  It is not for the fact that the restaurant didn't even acknowledge the fact that I waited so long.

I went to bed still hangry (hungry / angry)  because the food that arrived was simply awful.  The tom yum soup, which I ordered medium, and got with not spice at all,  seemed to be missing the lemongrass - normally the prevailing note in Tom Yum soup -  so it just tasted like murky broth with boiled chicken and mushrooms.  Pad Won Sen was awful. I ordered spicy and there was zero spice in the dish, but two small containers of chili sauce in the bag.  I guess its "DIY" spicy.  Those noodles were an overcooked gloppy, mess, at once falling apart and stuck together in clumps, and swimming in an Exxon Valdez level oil slick.  The were at once bland and horribly over salted.  The only other flavor seemed to be too much acrid garlic  (and I actually love garlic), and a heavy dose of MSG.  I had to throw this food out.  I went to bed hungry, mad, with a gasoline-like after taste, stank breath that was no match for toothpaste and mouthwash, and an MSG headache  (I'm mildly allergic to MSG).  I woke up, and realized I need to spend most of the day near the restroom, while this abomination that was called food works its way out of my system.

I was sitting in Inglewood Park Cemetery, on January 3rd around 12:45 pm and the delivery man from Chana's came in and I was hungry and decided it would be nice to get something to eat after paying for my Mom funeral. Well I said "Sir" twice to the delivery man and he completely ignore me, and then I asked the girl at the desk , the name of the eatery and she said she wasn't sure, so when the delivery guy, was finished counting his money, I tried one more time and still no reply. I figure if the people had order the food, I would at least give it an one star, but that behavior was deplorable

Not your typical Inglewood restaurant. Maybe, it is the cuisine. I love Thai dishes, and I was looking for another Asian spot nearby, but saw the word, "Thai," and I had to try it. The interior is beautifully decorated, and the food is simply great. I had the vegetables in teriyaki sauce, the sauce was a tad sweet, but may taste a little better with rice. In couldn't eat any rice, the rest of my daily meals are all high in fiber. I didn't want to feel bloated after lunch. Good choices for meat eaters, or vegetarians-I'm a veggie.< /text>

I absolutely love Chana's. It is my ultimate favorite spot for Thai. I used to drive from Downey to Inglewood just for this place. The pad Thai is delicious, and I've never had orange chicken quite like the one they serve here. It's delicious and I can't get enough of it. Please visit this restaurant! It's well worth it. You won't be disappointed.

Also, if youre stomach still has room for more, please try the mango sticky rice. Trust me, it is amazing!< /review>

If you like Pad Thai, you will love this place. So good. Noodle World got nothing on Chana's for the PAD THAI.< /review>

<text>After opening one of the bags containing my food, I got a whiff of something that smelled disgusting, like stale dish rags that have been sitting in water and haven’t been washed in months. I reached inside the bag and out came my hand, with the awful smell all over it. I washed my hands multiple times and I still can’t get rid of the smell!!

The dumplings are tiny and not worth the money. They didn’t provide me with salad dressing or chopsticks like I asked. The box containing my Kung pao chicken was broken and leaking all over the place, which the chicken was also over-cooked and tough.

I’m so wigged out by the smell on my hand that I can’t even bring myself to eat the food I bought.

I will not be ordering from this place again.< /text><Name>Janet</Name>< resp>

I order kung pao chicken  not spicy and nasty flavored and the teriyaki chicken  nasty as well they use the same chicken for both so its seems as your eating the thing just different flavored . And to make matter worst over priced.  Never again !!!!< /text>

<Date>1398296040837< /Date><username>Pamela Perez</username><Review>Delivery was quick. Unlike other Thai places I've ordered from that rush thru you ordering and lack customer service etiquette, the lady that helped me with my order was very patient and kind over the phone. I ordered everything Vegan. It was pretty tasty and arrived steaming hot.

I really liked the spice (I ordered it Hot but next time I'll ask for extra hot since I can tolerate the heat)
I liked the way the veggies were cut, there was love put into them.

I ordered:
Kee Mow (spicy noodles)~ were well cooked,  edible, just needed a bit more mint flavor and I'd gave it all a 5star.. Definitely two persons could split the plate.

Tom Kha Soup~ was delicious
Side of Brown rice~ was a good amount and well cooked.
Green Curry with Tofu~ thickness was good and it was tasty (tofu was not overcooked, still spongy and soft inside)</Review></record></dataset><record>

Normally i dont rate restaurants. But this time i really need to.. Do not go to this restaurent. The waiters are so Awfull and customerservice very pooor..
Myself and my girlfriend went to this restaurent, and asked for noodles which should be Spicy.. The waiter gave us our food and after taking two bites, We found out the food was uneatable. It was waaaay to Spicy and both of the waiters started laughing and talking in their  Language.. Both of us are used to very Spicy food, but this was over the limit..
as we couldnt eat any more We went.. As We went out of the door, We could see Them laughing their ass OFF.. So people: save your Money from this :)<//Text>

The fried rice was the best. All the food had a fresh taste. But thai barbeque needed a little bit more bbq flavor. It was still good. The Pad Woon Sen was fresh. The tofu needed to be cooked more.

Food over all enjoyed by all. Comfortable atmosphere.< /review>

The guy at the register should get the cashier's win of the day! It's nice to shop in your clean, organized and enjoyable store. You always have new fun things on your shelves that I cant resist!

<Text>Face masks required. Low customer traffic.  Friendly staff. Easy on and off the 101 in Atascadero.  Many clearance items.  Some groceries.  Seasonal items at a great price.  I'll go back again.<//Text><user_id>107146170786822341783<//user_id>< Date>

< Review>
To me Big Lots, is a high five I would like to let you know what I think about Big Lots and up its perks and pros and cons. Iskcon is that there's not many Big Lots around North America. But good quality items that's his Pro. That's its Pro?! Is Perks is at how much stuff can fit in one store. They've got beds they've got couches. They also have good stores food, and a wide variety of beverages. The Quality Inn 3 of 5 stars. And a quantity is 2 out of 5 stars. They may run out? But they keep having the general public come back for more. I like them. That's why did they deserve 3 out of five stars.

If you don't want to catch Coronavirus, don't shop here. Mask policy NOT ENFORCED. Including the MANAGER of the store. Usually they have good, cheap stuff. But my life is to high a price to pay.< /review>

Excellent customer service . From Denise , the manager to our cashier, which I didn't catch her name. Short dark hair with glasses and pretty nails. A Male manager came to join the cashier and he was super helpful also. I love that store.<//text>

<rate>4<//rate><Review>Atascadero store is really nice n big. I like shopping there. Only thing today I wasn't too happy with was that the isles were blocked or semi blocked with carts full of boxes because they were restocking shelves n it was hard to get to items already on shelves that I needed. Almost all workers were pleasant. Some need some need to answer when spoken to instead of ignoring a customer. That's kind of rude I believe. I don't think she was enjoying the restocking chore... But overall I always have a good experience shopping there... I'll be back soon...<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

Wouldn't recommend shopping here. A employee was staring at my husband the entire time we were shopping making him feel  really a comfortable.  A Hispanic guy in his late 30's. 😢</text>

<review>I love to come here to find some good deals. Good for dog toys, storage stuff, some cleaners, and garden stuff. It's fun to go to big lots every now and again.<//review>< time>

<Text>Lots of good bargains, but sometimes items are found at same price that's available at a regular store so you're not saving much. Do pay attention to what you're buying and be aware of the prices outside this Discount Retailer.<//Text><response>None</response>< userid>

Always a great deal and a great hidden find somewhere in the store. I didn't realize I needed 2 bags of cat food, and a pack of Bottle Caps candy until I walked around for a few minutes. Their curtain sheers are also a good deal.</Text>

Inexpensive products with not the best quality but it serves the purpose for economic reasons. Customer service is subpar compared to retail stores in the neighborhood.<//review>

Came in when they were a little short handed and Justin who was at the front desk hopped in between taking phone calls and cashing people out to get my car in and out in a timely manner. He also had my tires checked before giving me a great price for 4 new tires. Thank you so much Justin for all of your help and hard work!</review>

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND I just had the best experience here !!!  After having a not so good experience at a place near my house in Patterson, I am glad I made the trip to Modesto. The new owner Marcos is a very knowledgeable honest hardworking family man and I am very happy that he took over this establishment. The fact that he drives 2hrs everyday from Madera to be here says a lot about his commitment.

He took very good care of us and went ABOVE and BEYOND my expectations and has amazing customer service. All the staff were very friendly and I enjoyed observing the great work ethic and community driven culture among them. I watched him give the same excellent service to other customers, which shows his goodwill. I didn’t have to wait long at all and I was ready to get back on the road. I look forward to bringing my car here for an AC recharge for the hot summer days in the valley. I will recommend all my friends, family and colleges to come here. FIVE STAR SERVICE ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</Text>

Manager was very flexible and worked with my crazy schedule. He is the real deal and been in the industry for awhile. Very knowledgeable!!! Staff was very efficient too with the tire change and alignment. They also interacted with my toddler son who was having a rough day. Several customers came throughout the day and were all treated well. All were happy but some crazy guy who was over the top(loose cannon). Great experience and will come back for tire needs!

I came in concerned and slightly weary because I've heard of horror stories where mechanics do stuff to your car and are shady. These people from the beginning were professional,kind and felt like I could trust them. They serviced my car and did a fantastic job. I know my go to place. I will definitely be telling my friends and family to come here! Thank you< /Text>

<Text>My entire experience with American Tire Depot was excellent. I ordered my tires through the corporate customer service phone line, and the agent, Gemma, was pleasantly and patience.  She confirmed my tire shipment to and appointment at the Modesto Prescott location.   I arrived on time and was personally greeted by the manager. Although replacing my tires took much longer than I expected, but throughout the process, the entire staff was courteous and professional. They took time to explain the problem to every customer and kept the customers updated on the.progress. I definitely would recommend this tire shop to anyone. The icing on the cake was their current buy three get one free promotion. Thank you for the great experience!< /Text>< Resp>

Went in to get my new wheels and tires installed and everything went fine until I noticed, there was damage to my passenger side. Went home and saw a dent on my rocker panel.Took it back and apparently wasn't them. If you make a mistake own up to it but don’t make it seem like I’m just trying to get a quick one and done. Yes you have trained professionals but sometimes mistakes occur. I wont take it up to corporate since they were very nice with the installation but very sad to have experienced it this way.</text>

<name>angel Ck<//name><Date>1609210590361< /Date><rating>4</rating><text>Prices are reasonable. I've been here three times for tires, alignments and tire rotations. It's usually quick depending how many vehicles they have in front of yours. As far as customer service, it can seem a bit rude but they get straight to the point. Theres no "welcome" feeling, it's more like a "what do you need". Not a big deal for me.<//text>< Pics>

Bad customer service, I am new doing business in Modesto need it to air up a tire this shop refuse to help me, I will not go to this place in the future if I need to purchase a tire, first impression is vital.
Shop two buildings down help me and fix my leak and prices are reasonables. Definitely better CS than American Tire Depot.< /Review>

<Review>Arrived for my 3:30 appointment and they couldn't find my appointment that I had an email confirmation for, then found out my tires that I selected online were not even in the store. What's the point of the appointment system after selecting tires online? I was an American Tire Depot customer in socal and never had an issue. Drove close an hour for this, unacceptable. Luckily the close by America's Tire was able take care of me that same day and they were closing in 1hr.</Review></record></dataset><record>
<Text>This place is terrible i took my truck there for tires and got a good deal. I took my wife's car there also for tires to get another good deal. They broke my wife's hubcap and cross treaded her stud and now I had a flat on my truck and I have to replace a stud on my truck because they stripped it out. This place is a joke don't go here they don't know what they are doing.<//Text><Response>{'time': 1608279362298, 'text': 'Hi John,\n\nThank you for bringing this up to our attention.

< Review>
The staff at American Tire Depot went above and beyond to help solve my tire problem today. I made arrangements to leave my flat tire for repair and before I could get into my car to leave they told me that they would repair the flat and reinstall my tire within 20 mins. I highly recommend them for all your tire needs.< /Review>

Well the sales rep was real responsive and helpful the crew he had was  quick and handled my suspension situation in a timely fashion. The thing that I liked the most about this specific location and crew was the tried to work with my budget and what I could afford. In today’s economy that’s important</Text>

<Text>Went in in the morning for a brake job and oil change. They said it would only take a couple hours. I called couple times after several hours. They eventually called me at 6p when they were closing to pick up the car. I confirmed they did the brakes and oil, they said they did and put a oil change sticker in the window. When I got home I checked the oil, it was dark and below the minimum line. They hadn't done the oil change at all. Now, I need to go check to see if the brakes were done properly.

Had a nail in my tire found during a tire rotation. Heritage Ford referred me to American Tire Depot. In and out in 20 minutes despite them being super busy on a Friday AM. And they did not charge me. Much appreciated. They look to have a great selection of tires and offer many automotive services, too.</Review>

Bought a new tire and installed it on the spot because I needed it urgently. The mechanic said that the air pipe that goes to the tire is a little loose and might need replacement. So I asked him can I do it later as I have to be somewhere so he said okay. Long story short the newly purchased tire got flatlined at the freeway and damaged tire beyond repair, within an hour of installation. The mechanic was either lazy or didn't know enough to explain the severity of the issue with the tire that should have been fixed right away. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone unless you want mediocre mechanics and waste your money.< /text>

This place took more than 4 hours to change tires and alignment!!! After that alignment, the sensor for the flat tires messed up!! Broken!!! Beside, they left me with almost flat tire, about psi 14!! So, I asked to inflate tires, but the guy inflating tire told me that he just filled the air in my tires!!! That was a lie!!! I trusted him saying at that time!! But reminded from a technician that I got sick about 14 and very dangerous!!! Very dishonest place and people!!!</text>

<Rating>4<//Rating><Review>I got my front 2 tires replaced yesterday. Good experience so far, but the wait was pretty long during this specific visit. They were busy when I came in but still, it took a little over 2 hours to finally get to drive off. Nice employees but had a slow service. Still would go back again.</Review>< Time>

<Text>Here’s my experience, took my car to get 1 tire replaced. Was told it would be $130 and be about 1 hour and 30 minutes (they had to get it from another location and I got there at 11:30am). I went to go run some errands. Was taking too long so I went to see what was happening. I pulled up at 2:20pm with my car exactly how I left it. Went inside and was told it would be another hour, tire wasn’t there yet. Went to the place like 30 feet away and was taken care of immediately. And they only charged me $95 for everything. You learn from experience :)< /Text><name>R Armenta</name></record>

<review>I needed to go out of town early on Saturday, I got off of work at 5pm on Friday. They close at 6pm and I didn’t get here until 5:58. I needed 4 new tires on my car and they took me in when everyone else would be closed. I AM SO HAPPY! If they hadn’t taken my car in, I wouldn’t have been able to go out of town until later in the day on Saturday. Thank you!< /review><userid>109838750533449432468</userid>< resp>

Juan very professional and courteous and polite. He estimated a 2 hour turn around for my wheel alignment to be complete. 45 minutes later he notified me that my vehicle was ready! He stated that he managed to organize personnel to complete several projects in a minimal amount of time. Thank you for your efficient and well organized staff.< /Text>

I recently took my 2008 Toyota Tacoma and my 2014 Toyota 4Runner in for wheel alignments. My girlfriend and I were treated very nice by the staff and the manager. They fixed my vehicles to my liking, and in a timely manner. I recommend taking your vehicles here if you need suspension work done. Prices are not bad and are comparable to other shops in the area.<//Text>

I recommend this place to everyone!!!! Josh was such a easy going and truthful manager!!!! I can’t explain how hard it is to find a good and honest automotive shop but I can honestly say I have found it!! American tire depot on Prescott is hands down the best shop I have ever been too. Thank you so much for the experience josh and Michael< /review>

I got good service and actually got a better tire than what they sold me because they were out of what they sold me.  The only reason I am giving them a 4 is because my name was not in their system even though I have been buying my tires for all my vehicles there for a few years now.  I guess they changed management there cause the guy I always dealt with isn’t there any more.  It took them longer than usual to put my tires on as well.  Other than that it was good service.</text>

Juan is killing it, he is definitely great at managing this location! This place is busy but they get you in and out while working efficiently. I am grateful for how quickly they were able to patch my tire and get me on the road.< /Review>

I had an urgent need for appointment, and was accommodated right away. The staff addressed my questions and did not try to pressure me or up sell. As a result, I will be back the next time I need tires.< /Review>

Best tire shop in town! The manager here named Alex has excellent customer service. I’ve been here multiple times to purchase tires or replace them. He has never given me a difficult time or been rude about me going in to replace my tires due to nails or pot holes. He tells you straight forward what’s the price, any deals, and what will need to be replaced. All the employees there are nice and respectful. In person and on the phone.I’ve never had a bad experience here. They stick by their warranty which is great! Saves me money. Warranty is worth it.< /text>

My experience with American Tire Depot was awesome! I came to them last minute when I missed my oil change appointment with my dealership. They we're able to help me as soon as I walked in. The whole process took about an hour (which worked because I commute to Milpitas for work and I have to leave by noon to make it). There was a small issue of having to wait in the lobby after my car was serviced. Within the the time I dropped it off and the time I picked it up, the lobby was considerably busy! I waited for a while but I understand because they were helping other customers. After a while they noticed that I'd been waiting  and one if the guys there said " Sorry about the long wait guys, this one is on the house, please follow up with us for the recommendations I wrote down on your paperwork!". I was pleasantly surprised and will definitely be coming back for my future car maintenance needs. 😉<//text>

Website had you make appt. for tires I purchased only to go there and be told they don't have them. Came back second time after all was squared away and to be told again they do that have all four but three. However, Shaun, the mgr. got me some higher grade tires for same promised price of lesser tires.<//Review>

If you care about your wheels and you car I suggest taking it somewhere else for tires. My dad took my car in because I had to work and specifically asked them to be careful with my wheels and they SCRATCHED every single wheel! We even tipped them prior. On top of that they denied responsibility for damages to my property. And every time you try to reach them or Justin, the Regional Manager,  they will not return the call. I assume in hopes that it will go away. They practice poor business management and lack business integrity. Be warned if there is an issue they will not take responsibility and they will not return your calls.</Review>

<review>Everyone is professional and kind. Except for my last visit, I sat and waited for nearly 3 hours for 2 new tires, rotation and alignment. Didn't get rotation and they had my car parked outside for over an hour and half until I asked how much longer it would be. They brought the car in and supposedly did an alignment in 5 minutes. So, not sure if alignment actually happened. Will return and update this review.<//review>< response>

Great service coming for years but they changed ownership. Surprisingly service was still excellent if not better. Josh my mechanic is the absolute best I even followed him to the other location. This guy went above & beyond every time I needed help. Company even offers small loans for repairs (depends on credit but I have horrible & I was approved). Only negative is they busy so best to book appointment. Lol</text>

<Review>February 2019 This is the 2nd time American Tire Depot has the best prices for my car. But, this isn't the same car that I was driving before, so they did an expectation for me.  I have some problems that need fixing, but didn't  know what those problems were until the free inspection was finished.  Sean and Juan let me know what needed to fixed and gave me quotes, but Juan showed me on my car all of the pro lem they found, and explained to me how those problems affect my car  Juan also put some coolant in my car for me at no charge. All I. All, Sean and Juan were pretty expedient and awesome.  I am a satisfied customer, and I will return.

Last year.
I called around and this was the only location that had the tire I needed in stock and at an affordable price.  After some complications with the tow truck driver my car was towed to this location, and the driver dropped my car on top of the tow bar while backing up. The manager of this shop brought me out to look at before letting the driver continue, and explained to me the damage he is already visually seeing caused by this event.  He also explained ed to the driver that if he didn't know what he was doing, he should not have towed my car.  Long story short, we let the driver go after I got all of his information and took pictures.  The manager offered to inspect my car for damages when they have it up to replace the tire.  I will only use this shop from now, for their consideration of the well being of my vehicle, and for their expertise. It was a busy office when I arrived, but well worth the extra wait for the extra service.<//Review><rate>5</rate><UserId.>112021893386791299127< /UserId.><time>1549604244722<//time>< Resp>

Unbelievable service.  No offense ladies but I drove my wife’s car today for the first time in about two years. Noticed some issues potential he with the tires affecting the ride. Stopped in to see if they could take a look at it. They not only diagnose the issue they fix the problem and even though we didn’t purchase those tires there they did it all for free.

I fully expected to pay and was wildly Surprised when there was no charge. Felt bad so I gave the guy that did the work 20 bucks for beer money, or whatever.

Hard to find this kind of service these days I’m definitely going back there to buy my next set a tires even though it’s in another city.< /Review>

I was shopping for tires and was going to Big O Tires . I stopped at American Tire Depot on Presscott Rd.and spoke with Josh, he was knowledgeable and he gave me a great deal cause I was going to buy at Big O. I had a front end allignment done and I needed an adjusting screw which cost $49 and the labor was going to be about $100 , I was kind of hesitant but he explained the importance and offered $50 Labor charge .I am a senior citizen and I really appreciated that gesture and his honesty. I really recommenond American Tire Depot because the staff is also courteous and very nice and it shows that they care about their customers..

<Text>I have changed my rating from the 5 star I gave below to 1, only because I can’t give a zero...
This last wknd, less than two wks after my “oil change”, I drove down to Fresno to visit my bf.  Just before getting there my oil light came on & alarm started dinging. My bf checked my oil stick & found barely a drop of dirty oil on the end of the stick. We drove to a nearby auto parts store & bought a gal of oil, (recommended for my truck) & put in FOUR QUARTS OF OIL!  My truck only takes 6 quarts!  OMG!
My truck was not leaking oil and I didn’t smell or see any on my engine, so... my question to you Sean, Mr Manager, is did you know the oil change had not been done on my truck?  Is that why you pushed the keys toward me & said Merry Christmas, letting me assume the oil change had been done for no charge?  Or do you have an employee, that started to drain my oil & for some reason stopped & didn’t complete it.. Or do you just have an employee that told you it was done when it wasn’t ?
But why did you let me assume I got a free oil change? And why was the check engine light not reset when I got in my truck to go home?
I am so upset at you guys. I could be needing a new engine if we hadn’t checked it out as soon as we did & since you gave me no paperwork in reference to my oil being changed, (gee, I wonder why), I have no proof you did or didn’t change my oil. I should have followed my feeling that something wasn’t right & asked more questions...
I wish I could take the donuts back  ):
Debbi Smith

I called about an oil change & was told to “come on in”. I dropped off my truck & was told it would take 1-1/2 to 2 hrs. After 3 hrs, I hadn’t heard from them so I walked over. There were several ppl in the lobby. I was acknowledged, but I could tell Sean was on the phone with someone about something that had to get resolved. I stood around listening, thinking this is going to take a while...
I assume it got pretty busy after I dropped my truck off, but after about 20 mins, while still on the phone, my keys were slid across the counter to me with a “Merry Christmas” & a smile. Now that’s what I call 5 star service!!
They got 2 dozen donuts from me today. Merry Christmas to you all too!</Text>< Date>

They were trying to convince me, I needed new tires just to pull out a single nail.he approached me, Hey bro you need new tires and made some bullshit remark saying they can't pull out the nail and I went to another tire shop and fixed the tire no problem took 5 minutes. Be careful with shops like this go to multiple ones first you go through with it.<//text>

<time>1510169173329</time><Text>I would give ZERO stars if I could. The guy at the front office is a very rude. We called on a Monday morning to order a set of tires, they told us to be there at 5pm same day. Came in as my appointment time was 5pm and they told me unfortunately they couldn’t get the tires. I was pissed because I left work earlier for nothing. That same night someone called me to ask if I co of reschedule for the next day,  I said no because I had an appointment at 12pm, so the same guy asked me what if I can get you out of here by 11:30am? I said that would be acceptable. Came in the next day to replace the tires. Got to the location at 10:30am, the rude tattooed guy at the front desk was clearly irritated because I was asking questions about the tires, also told me several times we are paying to have these tires here for you, like it was my fault for his bad mood. I would also have to say that on the mean time that I was at the store, he was on the phone with DMV solving personal problems. At the end I told him I would like to buy the tires and install somewhere else andam again the rudeness was rude the limits, he handle my keys back throwing on the counter as it was nothing, my car worth over $170,000!!! He said you can take your car, I’ll send the tires back. By far the worst tire store I’ve ever been in my life. I would not go there never again!!

I had a great 1st experience with American Tire Depot today. Their customer service is awesome! They're honest and make you feel like they really appreciate your business. This morning I called and spoke with Josh about an estimate for front brakes and calipers. (I had received a quote from another place that was too high for my budget to have them replaced today.) Josh encouraged me to bring the car in for an inspection with them, so I did because its a good idea to get a second opinion. Their inspection showed I didnt even need the calipers replaced after all, so I was able to afford to replace the brakes today. Now I feel safer driving. So glad I called ATD today. I normally don't take the time to write reviews,  but I'm so pleased with the services I received today I felt the need to. I'm going to refer everyone I know to ATD on Prescott in Modesto.< /Text>

The manager jake provided probably the worst custimer service possible . he was extremely rude and kept miss informing me about everything. He was more concerned about his own car problems that it showed in his unprofessional attitude. I had scheduled an appointment for 3 and arrived at 245 i only needed to tired studs replaced on the same tire. In the process they broke another one and took an hour just to order the part. On top of that they said they quoted me wrong and it would cost more . worst service ever please avoid at all cost< /review>

Overall experience was very positive but with a twist.

Purchased 4 tires from this American Tire Depot after the fiasco with the American Tire Depot 2 on McHenry. Originally had a appointment to get the new tires installed on saturday and decided to see if i could get them installed on friday instead. Called around 12pm and the gentleman at the counter told me he could get me in if i got there before 5:30pm. Said thanks and left work early. Got there around 4:45pm. Guy at the counter for some reason knew who i was. Acknowledged that i had some issues with the one on McHenry. (Still dont know how he knew as i never told him.) Guy was very helpful and always addressed me by my first name which is rare now a days. Got me started on my tire install at around 5:15 pm or so. They started to work on my car and get the tires installed when the unthinkable happened. They sent 1 wrong tire of the 4 i had asked for.  As it is i have strange tires on my fiat (told over and over again by all the tire places).  Dillian (i hope thats his name) calls me over and said they have an issue they sent one wrong tire. I was like Nooooo... (was over exaggerating but was a little mad) Dillian (let me know ill edit this post) was very professional and said ill take care of you ill call right now and have them send me a tire in the morning. At first i was upset but as he was very professional, never lost his cool and apologized i said all right ill come back in the morning.

Also on a side note when i was there there was a hispanic gentleman talking to my wife in the waiting area. The elderly man was talking to her and was saying that they are very busy here and that he wasn't sure if he was going to be able to get his tire worked on or not. I was in the garage area and i swear to you Dillian was working on a tire and all of a sudden stopped what he was doing walked to the door to the waiting area and said dont worry sir i didn't forget about you ill get you fixed up shortly. He walked back out the the garage and went right back to helping his crew.

My wife on saturday told me that the guy had like super hearing or something because after the the elderly man told her about them helping him or not that's when dillan came back and reassured him. She was kinda freaked out and told the elderly man in spanish they have mics up in here or something as how would he know what we were talking about in spanish.?!?!?! ( Spider senses with a helping of google translate lol)

Saturday comes along and i call around 11am and before i can even tell him who i am he tells me. Come on in your tire is here. I was like wow ok cool be there in a few. Get there and as i am walking in he is walking out to get the keys and pulls it up to get it serviced. Last tire is installed and he tells me to come back every 5k miles for tire rotations.

Overall great service and good tire rates.</review>

I had an emergency. I looked them up and their website stated they open at 7am. I was waiting for them at 7am to open. It was 7:45am and still waiting... if you say you open at a certain time then maybe you should open at that time.</review>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>I am so glad that I went to this store. I am from Louisiana and have been working in Modesto with no family here. I had just purshaced 4 tires for my lil Honda Civic SI at Costo, hit a low curb and blew both tires out on the passanger side. To my horror these tires were on back order and were not compatible with any other type tires. I searched everywhere for 2 more to match with the 2 good ones with no luck. In the mean time my full coverage insurance did not cover for a rental car. I went to this store and it was finally explained to me why my tires were so hard to match. They were directional tires. The guys here explained to me in detail about the difference between directional and nondirectional tires. I was given a quote on 4 new tires that were nondirectional as I had decided that in case I had a blow out again I would have the same problem if I stayed with the directional tires. However with the nondirectional tires I would be able to easily replace the damaged tire. I was quoted a price on 4 high end Michelin tires and got a$ 70.00 rebate off them as well. The guys told me to let them know if anyone beat their price and they would go even lower in price on these tires. I spent the next day shopping around and even went back to Costco for quotes on the tires trying to beat their price. I was not successful so I went back to the Tier Depot and got my 4 tires for better than 200.00 what everyone else wanted. I got the best price, customer service and respect from these fellas at The American Tire Drpot on Prescott in Modesto CA. I will Let all of my friends that I know here to go to them as I believe they are honest, hardworking  guys who will stand by their product. It is nice to know that they also will take care of my rotation for free. I will buy my next set from them in the future. Thank you so much Gentlemen for being king and understanding to this Southeren gal.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

My experience at American Tire Depot on Prescott was awesome. They are courteous and very reasonable and I appreciate them letting me know what they found wrong with my car while serviing it. Most car repair places will sometimes tell you they can’t fix the car unless something else is done and end up paying way more than expected and then find out it wasn’t a problem at all.. So I truly thank the staff at American Tire Depot for their outstanding customer service and their honesty about my vehicle.❤️</text>

<Text>Got our 4Runner lifted today. They did a really good job on the lift. Good pricing for both alignment and lift. Customer service was great. They gave us a good estimated time and vehicle was done in the same day. Very happy we chose to go with this place cause my time got wasted with another shop yesterday. California wheels & tires were super professional. Thank you for making us happy!<//Text>< Pictures>

Paid for some new 20s and tires and the owner gave me the cheapest set of tires n wanted to charge me 300 extra for some name brand tires, which I specifically asked him what tires was he putting on n he said some good ones, so I said ok. Said my tires were worth $700 so I said ok but gave me some tbb tires which are worth 400-450. Then he tried to lie to me saying that the tires were already mounted which he took the display off the show room n mounted new tires on there. This place is not honest and fair.<//Text>

They are deceitful guys. I bought from them Japanese tires. But they placed made in Thailand tires. I had to call police on them to get it fixed. Never ever waste your time and your money. Horrible owner. and horrible customer care. They put $60 tires for $170. So deceitful and con.

Since you wanted to buy tire is made in America, have you had money for it. Do you respect services you had in the past for free? you wanted to spend $60 dollars and buy American MADE tires lol. You're new in the country and will learn American ways with the time as you learnt writing reviews you would learn how to use google to research about tires. good luck from  cheap level to higher end."}< /resp>

I looked around a few tire shops in sac area to replace my stock wheels and tires for my Toyota Tundra . This place looked clean and looked like they new what they were doing . Wrong!!!! Manager promised my wheels would not rub after he modified bumper  a little .. wrong!! I had to do it myself . His alignment machine also scuffed all four of my brand new wheels.  When I asked what he could do to make it right like replace the brand new wheels he told me nothing he can do about it .then just closed his shop door . Will not recommend at all . If you take your truck here to get wheels and get black wheels beware. Will leave a perfect scuff mark in your rim right where there alignment hooks up to your wheel . Take your truck somewhere else. Would give them a zero if I could . Very disappointing.</Text>

They recommended a couple brands that they carry but were open to using any wheel or tire brand that I preferred. I ended up buying wheels from a different online shop and having them shipped to this place. I had the 6 inch lift put on, with 20 inch wheels and 35s tires. Super stoked on the outcome! After driving off the lot, a warning light came on. I called the shop and they had be bringing it in whenever I could. Took it in the next day and they were able to fix the issue within 10 mins. I’d definitely recommend these guys to anyone.<//text>< UserId.>

<text>I would not recommend this tire shop I put a lift kit in my truck and was charged 200 dollars for an alignment that was never done.  The rear lift was higher than the front I was not happy with their job.  They were not willing to work with me to fix what they did.  I called them several times.  They have absolutely horrible service and are very unprofessional.  I would not even reccomend to my wost enemy.<//text>< pictures>

I had some work done on my car at a mechanic and I needed to get my car aligned. I took the car to LesSchwab and was told the car needed further adjustments. I asked LesSchwab if they could fix it and sarcastically was told that they couldn’t. I then brought the car to Oscar. Oscar in depth explained what the problem was. Here I go take the car back to the mechanic. The mechanic makes his adjustments. I take the car back to Oscar. Turns out the guys at LesSchwab were doing something incorrectly. Oscar was able to get the problem fixed, and align my vehicle. I was so surprised at how little I paid for all the work he did. Oscar kept in communication with me the whole time he had my car, because not only did he align my car he fixed what LesSchwab wasn’t able to fix. Oscar has just earned himself a happy client.< /text>

Brought my truck in for a lift and wheels , they made it really easy to pick out wheels for my truck. Service was done on time and I love how it turned out. Recommend this place for your tires, wheels and other service.< /review>

These guys are a joke. I spent a ton of money on getting a vehicle lifted from them with tires and wheels I left their shop they did not tell me the fitment was wrong they did not warn me in any way shape or form and when I did one u-turn my tires got ruined and they are telling me the best they can do is give me the tires at $900 for two of them!</text>

<rating>1</rating><Review>Today a family member and I went in to change out our vehicles tires. I asked the cashier if he had a certain tire in stock, he checked the inventory, and said yes. I told him I had an appointment in a little over an hour, he said it would be no problem and I would be more than early to the appointment. He took my money and then explained he didn't have the tires, but then said he could get them down the street in just 10 minutes. After an hour of waiting I had to leave for my appointment, he said it would be another little while. I waited more than an hour and a half for a promised "10 minute job".

Looking to buy a set of rims for my ride. Stopped by to check out the selection and terrible customer service. Had two brown guys sitting behind the counter who didn’t understand anything I asked for and are extremely slow at using the computer to show a selection of rims. I had to teach them how to select my specifications for rims and still didn’t understand what I needed. Horrible service and language barrier. Needs a more professional sales person to do the job otherwise this place is doomed.<//Review>

Got the rims, tires and leveling kit I wanted in less than 2 hours. Saved over $500 from the competition in Sacramento and the inventory was the best I’ve found yet. Definitely taking my vehicles here from now on. A business ran correctly. Don’t look elsewhere. I already wasted that time for you. Financed it partially and that was also painless.<//Review>< pictures>

They sell tire cheaper than other place but the service sucks. I bough 4 tired last month and got a flat tire recently I went back and they fixed it ( side wall nail which mean don’t repair ) after a week that I came the guy said oh you told us to repair it and we repaired which is not true at all coz I dropped my car and came back after 2 hours. So this flat repair is not refundable which was fine with me but their service is too low will not come back and don’t recommend it at all.
Don’t repair your tire here they do it unprofessionally that is why it will leak.
Look how they repaired my tire.
Show this picture to anyone they will know this is not the way to repair a flat tire< /Review>

< review>
emailed them friday morning for a quote on a set of 17x7 xxr 530's never heard back, walked in sunday morning after church and asked and he just shrugged it off like oh, whatever, i then asked well do you have them in stock cause id love to see them next to my car before i make a final decision, he said no, so i asked if he had any 4 lug wheels in stock and he said no..... thought that was interesting since there was a  lug wheel behind me....wonder if he just didnt want to help me....  in response to this guys comment, yeah my car is a mini, the lug pattern is 4x100 which is literally the most common lug pattern on the road today. so saying he doesnt have 4x100 is a joke.</review>

They installed the wrong size tires on my truck and when I called to get them to take care of it he just hung up on me! When I had to pay another tire shop to put a whole new set of tires on it they told me that the black lug nuts I requested had where chrome ones that had been rattle can painted! This place is a joke and shouldn't be allowed to use the California wheels branding!!!    UPDATE IN RESPONSE TO THE OWNER! Two months later??? Try 2 weeks! You where to install 265 40 22s on my wheels and your crew put 265 45 22s on my truck! Its not my job as a customer to have to baby sit you guys!< /text>

<Text>Went here with a car I was thinking of buying, asked then to look at the wheels and tires because a sensor said something was wrong, they put in new tires sensors and said car was fine. I buy the car and immediately it starts having extreme vibrations when i travel kn the highway, I take it to MY mechanic and he says the control arm bushings are completely shot and DANGEROUS TO BE DRIVING ON!! these people are negligent and lazy.</Text><rating>1<//rating>< user_id>

He told me $190 for lower control arm when the price is only 83 dollar and when brought my own control arm i was how much u charge for change he said 240 and the minimum for changing is 100 to 120 dont come here he will rip u guys off

Answer to his reply:
Now the way u answer that shows ur service and shows what kind of person u are , for ur kind of information I bought the part in o Rilly for 90 and changed it for 90 and doing alignment for 40 today , make sure guys dont tell him to order something for u they charge 3 time more then original price , changing a part witch takes minimum 45 min they charge u 240 where every where else is 90 i used to go to California all the time for tires first time i talked with owner and he is not good from any angle about prices</review>

<Review>I bought 2 new tires.They left the center pieces of both of my wheels and when I went back they were rude and unwilling to help. They tried to tell me that the both fell off. Which is absolutely not true their employees who don’t speak any English left them off and the manager refused to do anything to help. There are plenty of tire shops in the area and I would highly suggest going anywhere but here.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<Review>Vehicle was delivered by 10 am Saturday morning. Was told it would be ready by 2pm same day. At 530pm, had to call to find out is not ready. No tech on Sunday so possibly ready on Monday. I say no go, keep it over nite & have it ready Sunday for pick up. They said they'll have tech finish it on Sunday. Not ready till 330-4pm Sunday. I picked up & paid.
I inspected work later in the week, nuts were hand tight, coil spring lock downs not installed properly& rear shock fell off top bracket...</Review>< Time>

I walked 2 miles to get to these guys as my car had hit and lost both front and band right rims. I used my spear for the front and came to these for the other one. I bought the rim and a tire walked 2 miles back with it, the guys forgot to mention the rim has its custom nuts or bolts. I called they said they won't deliver even if I paid. So I walk back two miles to go get the nuts and he was still rude saying I should've known about the custom rims. Few days later I go get my tires checked cz they were making some noise. America's tire tell me the guy who put the tire on the rim for ripped it and it's useless. And I had paid a total of 200 to these guy which was a total waste of my money and effort. These guys have no sense of courtesy.< /review>

<Text>🏆 The manager named DJ was professional and polite😇 He offered me great tires at discount prices and included an alignment👍🌟.  He met my budget and I saved lots of 💰💓.  I had shopped several merchants and this place is definitely the best👑 quality discount over America Tires🚫, Costco🚫, Sears🚫, PepBoys🚫, Discount Tires🚫 and Walmart🚫.

His shop has a huge selection of beautiful rims and wheels. Check it out💡</Text></record>

I stopped in for an inspection because my car was pulling to the right. When I left the car the car was doing the exact same thing and felt like a stage coach. They did a unnecessary alignment, dangerouly over filled my tires and failed to mention I had leaking ball joints on both sides. Which begs the question of whether or not they did anything at all besides get me for $50.
At the very least unprofessional and incompetent, quite possibly just plain crooks.</text>

Will never go back!!! THEY ABOUT COSTED ME AND MY DAUGHTER OUR LIFE. They over filled my tires and left the lug nuts very loose almost falling off. I went in for a balance, alignment, struts, and 2 new tires. I paid them good money and got my car back in worse condition than it was bringing it in. I paid for balancing the tires but when I brought them to Goodyear 15 mins. later they told me they could tell it was not ever balanced. I called the owner and complained about all that happened and he kept making excuses and said he would take care of me next time I come in. So stupidly we tried to go there again this time to purchase a whole set of tires and wheels thinking to give them another chance and the owner that said he would take care of us next time would not even take off $50.00 off the tires or rims and actually up'd  the price on us. He was very rude and not at all friendly. In fact he left us inside while he went out to help another customer. As we were leaving another customer was outside complaining he had to bring his car back cause they messed it up to. I never do reviews but had to on these guys I recommend to go somewhere else. They are to expensive, rude, no customer service and needs to be put out of buisness!!!!<//text>

Worse place, had tire change and balance they didn’t do the balance then I had to pay $65 in an other place to do the balance.
I don’t recommend this place for a tire change or wheel balance<//Text>

The service is great .. Inside its small but makes u feel like your at home and you got some delicious donuts looking at you lol the donuts are super good i love ordering there #3 special i believe it is that one it come with pancakes and eggs and your choice of meat.  I love the pancakes..  There so buttery and fluffy they literally feel like there melting in your mouth i really do reccomend this place< /Text>

The small Chinese folk that run the restaurant are very kinda and they tend to be very helping when it comes to being short of change. I have had nothing but an amazing experience going to this restaurant</text>

Famersville only has one donut shop in town its over priced and donuts aren't very good. I payed 12$ for 7 donuts she didn't give me the if u buy by the dozen i payed basically for each donut more then i was supposed to. Never went back n didnt eat the donuts they didnt taste good. I wouldn't waste my money  there again and the owner isnt friendly at all.<//Text>

Love this gym. The locations are very convenient, Olympic has easy parking. Equipment is always clean. The other gym goers are really chill, polite, helpful but not pushy. The owner is a gentleman and a fine business owner. Really worth the price. Highly recommend to all. They have all the best equipment you could ever want !<//Text>

I have worked out extensively at both the Pico and Olympic locations. The gym packs a lot of good equipment into the space. It has everything I needed. I was fortunate to train with a professional bodybuilder. We made significant gains while training at Bishoy. And, all of the members were serious about their fitness. I recommend if you want a good gym with flexible hours.< /text>

<review>I wish I could give this place negative stars. If you are looking for a gym, please check other gyms and avoid this place. The front staff is extremely rude. Just simply swipping in you get hit with insults. Zero costumer service skills. There are many other good gyms in LA. You will easily find a better gym with the money you will pay for this gym. Double check with their horrible policy and get yourself a better choice with modern equipment, clean environment, communicative and friendly staffs and better policy.</review>< time>

That Hanna person is nasty and rude. She needs to learn how to speak to people. I was going to inquire about a membership but after seeing how she was talking to the staff. I was mortified. No thank you. Go to another location unless you want to be spoken badly to. She needs to be FIRED IMMEDIATELY!< /Review>

<Text>The guy at the front desk has an unwelcoming and unpleasant attitude towards people with memberships and people attempting the day pass.
I would give this gym 0 stars. Very unwelcoming. Very unappreciated. The monthly price is too high for that kind of gym. There are plenty of cheaper and better equipped places.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

I believe a gym should be a positive, welcoming place to help me with my mental and physical goals. This place is quite the opposite. The owners are rude and unprofessional.  Avoid this place.< /review>

This gym is by far one of the best gyms I've ever been a member of. There's almost no distractions like at the other big box gyms and Bishoy's gym is a local gym. The gym has it's own unique atmosphere of individuals that want to make gains in the most efficient manner possible. Bishoy's is a gym that caters to people that want to see progress in their fitness journey.

For these reasons, I recommend this gym without hesitation to anyone who is serious about body building and achieving above average fitness results.<//Text>

Conveniently located, well kept, and equipped with a broad range of machines/weights. Great workout environment for intermediate to advanced lifters. Members are respectful and maintain a clean workout space. The owner does the great job maintaining quality and is a pleasure to do business with.< /Review>

Great place to go after long hours of work. After 8:30pm is very dead. I get the whole gym to myself. It's more like a private gym.< /review>

<review>I can see that I am getting fatter as I look at my latest pictures. So, I decided to go to this fitness center near our place. And I got a good service because they really helped me do what I could do to lose weight. I lost 2kls in just one week and it made me feel ready to lose more!< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< gmapID>

<review>Oh wow, I was looking for a gym to join after Covid, but reading the “you are not allowed in” after every negative feedback made me want to give this place a 1 star. Keep disrespecting potential and former clients and I am sure you won’t last long, especially now when so much depends on a good review and customer service.</review>< date>

Gym owner Bishoy is strictly dedicated to providing the best and safest environment for his clients to thrive. Real standup guy who is passionate about fitness in the right ways.

Equipment is top notch and gym has everything you could possibly need. I’ll be coming here for a long time.</Review>

<review>If you’re looking for a place to finally get on your grind and reach your physique goals, this place is it. If you’re looking to workout in groups or in a “safe” place, stick to orange theory or planet fitness. This gym is for pumping iron and getting yolked,  period.< /review>< pictures>

Just called to ask about membership packages. Guy could not break down pricing and did get a word in edge wise for potential membership. Lacked professionalism in patiently elaborating their overall services, Show some more salesmanship, edits must be made to the website as well I was not able to get a clear idea of the membership fees.</Text>

*Not a member, posting review based on customer interaction

Kinda want to join if you could post pricing on your website or staff could notify callers that would be great. I understand policy, but it's not traditional business practice to request a drivers license photo via text, especially prior to a committed sign-up.

[Update after owner reply]

I didn't think requesting information about pricing could get you banned from a business, but I guess it can. Interesting that giving someone 5 minutes of your time to create memberships is deemed a bad investment.

Bullet dodged, rating lowered.</review>

Bishoy is nothing but great. He has provided great information about his gym. He is up front with his communication and is kind and a great communicator. I've called him 3-4 times he calls back within a hour or so. His gyms are tremendously well equipped. I in fact, love the fact Pico doesn't have AC. Helps me get a good sweat in and the equipment is solid and well maintained. He takes good care to make sure everything is working properly. I've yet to see something broken. Always able to find parking, always able to get in use equipment. When the gym is open and busy, everyone is nice.</Review>

<Review>I just called them. The guy who picked up the phone didn't let me talk. He answered 1 question and hung up without taking a breath and while I was talking! Very rude. Left a bad impression.

I hope this feedback helps the owner get more out of his investment by improving.

[[ My response to owner's reply ]]

I didn't become a member after being treated so rudely.

That's how it works in this world when you're RUDE to a potential NEW CUSTOMER.

😆 "...till further notice"? 🤣

Your poor members have to put up with you. An owner who is punitive when at fault. Instead of admitting it and apologizing, you reply the way you have showing the world how you are.

Trying to bar someone who's not a member shows how you run your business.

Thank G-d for your rudness, I didn't become one of your members🏝😎🏝</Review>< time>

Please keep the gym open !  Best way to stay healthy is to exercise.    Also, this gym never has a big crowd, so if you want to stay in groups of 5 or less, its perfect for that.   No reason why small, private gyms should have to close during this time.< /text>

Ummm I was just reading the reviews and I’m not kidding it makes me want to sign up. The owner is a savage and doesn’t give a f. People shouldn’t be so picky or whiny during a pandemic where we’ll maintained OPENED gym are hard to come by. And it’s 24 hours!!! Even more rare, the 24 hour fitness with old machines and homeless people inside are around the corner.<//Text>

I love training here!  Always very clean, great equipment for a natural powerlifter like myself and the owner (Bishoy) is very accommodating to members.  Small businesses like this should stay open during times of crisis because it is a way to relieve stress (mental health is still health).  As long as all smaller gyms are super clean, have cleaner available for self use and traffic is monitored then risk is low.< /review>

If you're like most people who don't photocopy everything they place in the mail and don't have a copy of your cancellation months later, they'll argue "you can't prove you cancelled anything." The owner appears to make a habit out of responding to negative reviews on this platform - if he does so here and claims I never cancelled, yes I most certainly did.

Edit: As predicted, the owner responded and denied everything. I've got the email and text records, he simply refuses to accept them. The owner of this gym is lying. It would be a shame if covid19 put them out of business so a legit gym could take its place.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<Review>It's everything you would expect out of your neighborhood gym as its a bit on the smaller size but has quite a bit of equipment. The place is clean BUT the biggest issue is with the owner of the space. He legit yells at his customers over the smallest things to the point where it's extremely uncomfortable to be there. This happened MULTIPLE times during my membership and ended up cancelling my membership because it was that bad. He's very friendly during sign up but is quite rude otherwise. I'd look elsewhere if I was looking for a gym in the Rancho Park area.< /Review>< Name>

Great small gym to workout! You can go whenever you want if you join, which takes about 5 min. Really practical with equipment that's pretty much new. There's a small parking nearby and if you come at the right time, you get to see Bishoy in person!

Keep pumping, it's lightweight!!<//Text>

<Text>Easy access all day all night. If you are  beginners or a pro and want all equipments in one place not walking far from each other (sometimes i walked 3 floors to get different equipments). I am training for marathon here, the treadmills are really cool, there are down slopes to -8 i think. Not crowded and not too hot or too cold. I got free stuffs from mng many times, really nice local gym. Btw, bring your own water! But there is liquor store next door too.<//Text><rate>5< /rate><Resp>None<//Resp>< time>

< review>
I've been a member here for about 2 weeks now. This is the best gym that I've been to in LA. Small but they have more than most large chain gyms. Staff if very friendly and will learn to know you by name. Their equipment focuses on muscle building which is perfect for me. The cardio equipment from Nordictrack is actually making me enjoy cardio while watching Netflix. I've tried some of the big gyms and after paying the same price that I pay here, the only thing I flelt was frustrated because of the how crowded places like LA fitness are. There, no one re-rackes their weights or cares that there's 7 people waiting to use the bench that some guy is on his phone texting on. If you're looking for a friendly environment to workout where you won't have to wait in line for your equipment, where you get treated like an actual member and not just another face.... Look no further because bishoys gym is it.</review>

<Review>Couldn't be more happy and satisfied at Bishoy's Gym. I have worked out at LA Fitness, 24hour, etc. and none come even close to the experience I've had at Bishoy's. You walk in, are instantly greeted with a warm hello from Bishoy himself, and get to working out on world-class, clean, and brand new machines, weights, and more. The gym rarely gets crowded but if it ever does, all the members I've met are super nice and considerate and it's easy to switch between sets. The comfortable, welcoming environment at Bishoy's Gym is unparalleled--I would highly recommend it for anyone looking for the absolute best gym around.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>Its hard to say anything that hasn't already been said about Bishoy's Gym...  So I'll tell my story and why I joined:

I view finding a gym the same way you would when you're trying to find a new barber or hairstylist... you know when you find a good one, you're going to stick with it and be with them for sometime so you better vet them well.

I'm a 42 year old dad, with a "dad bod", of course like many men I worked out plenty in my teens and 20s, then life and poor workout habits and injuries and fatherhood got in the way.  I took years off and am now ready to get back into some good lifting but with the wisdom of my years and not the reckless abandon of being young and thinking my body is invincible, LOL.

I just moved to LA and was looking for a gym, of course checked out the standards like LA Fitness and 24 Hour Fitness and was disgusted by their sales tactics and generally un-knowledgable staff members.  Yes, those places were closer to me and more convenient, but I just couldn't bring myself to make a long term commitment to them because of their business model.  Was driving past Bishoy's on Pico and thought, "hmm, maybe that place has potential"

I called and made an appt with Bishoy to check the place out and wow, what a treasure.  Yes, its small, but if you want a good solid place to work out with CLEAN, and TOP OF THE LINE equipment... this is your place.  Not only that, but to reiterate what others have said, Bishoy is a great guy who takes care of his members and takes pride in his gym.

I'm really, really happy that I found a great place to workout and at the same time I get to support a business who is really doing it right.

Kudos to Bishoy and doing business right in this day and age!< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

<text>I live in Bakersfield and this is a spot I have to hit every time I'm in the area. The staff is friendly and attentive. The food is absolutely amazing. A little on the pricey side but well worth what you pay. You get a lot for your money. Me and the family usually have enough food to save after eating for a second meal the next day. I really wish there was one where I live.< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

I’m not gonna go on and on about the food. We all know how well known they are for there steaks and drinks. I’m posting this to show my appreciation for Rachel our waiter. Outstanding service very helpful and friendly. Best service by far in a long time. Ask for Rachel and your experience will go beyond just great eats! She was phenomenal at her job and her personality went hand in hand with her customer service skills.< /Text>

Overall it's alright. Went there for lunch. It was definitely pretty good food and filling.
Definitely would recommend going to dinner over lunch here. What you get at dinner and the experience you have is phenomenal.</text>

Service was good taking into account it was 7 of us. It took a while for our food to be prepared,  but taking everything into account with Covid, it was understandable. Ordered the steak salad and it was expensive but very large portion. Didn't have much steak and ended up with 2 big pieces of gristle but I didn't bring it to their attention. It was still an enjoyable salad.</Text>

The tables were staggered so to be designed for self isolation seating. Very efficient, clean, safe, and a great selection of delicious entrees. Especially the meat dishes and beef soups. I thoroughly enjoyed my lunch meal there mid week. It was quiet and relaxing to eat out again. I will be back with local friends to share the fine food and service.<//text>

<Review>The Experience wasn't so bad as waiting for a table when you could see 15 to 20 of them outside nobody sitting at them. Then I asked for the heater to be turned on and it took five times before someone finally did. The young man who did turn the heater on was amazing and continue to come back and asked us if we needed anything. We ordered our orders first or appetizers I should say they were delicious we were very happy with what we got. However we then ordered the steak and bread because the orders had filled us up so much. It was ordered medium rare and we got it extra well done. Since I absolutely cannot enjoy anything that is that well-cooked I let them know told them I was kind of in a hurry because we have another place to go to they told me they could remake it in about 8 minutes. We waited and unfortunately this time it came back a little bit medium and instead of saying anything I just paid for our meal and I gave it to my dogs. It was rather tough. When the staff would spot us and see that I was trying to get their attention they were very responsive which was nice like I say the young man I believe his name was Jacob was extremely on it. Picking up dishes that were empty glasses that were empty asking if I want it more coffee excetera. So there were enough waitresses to handle the outside area it just seemed like it took a while to get them back to the table. This is a rough time for everybody so I would actually have give this three and a half Stars.</Review>< Pics>

But I really want to give a shout-out to our wonderful server Shelley. She and her team took awesome care of us.

Also the hostess crew were great. Their estimate of the 45-min wait was spot on. And I do like that I was sent an SMS text rather than having to rely on a light-up puck. This allowed me to go do a little shopping during the wait.</review>< pics>

< Review>
Ordered take out. BEWARE. Food was cold and not good at all. Steak was hard and cold. Gave us smaller portions than usual. We ordered through door dash pick up AND EVERYTHING WAS $8 extra.  Cool Hand Lukes wouldn’t answer their phone so we went on their website to order food and directed us to door dash. We have complained through door dash as well. But it isn’t doordash’s problem because we personally had to go pick up the food. Overall bad experience. Definitely won’t be ordering again.<//Review>

<text>Cool Hand Luke's is open with a very nice patio setup. They have tents set up so there is plenty of shade. The menu has all of your favorites. I had prime rib- yum! The beef cut like butter and the seasoning gave a satisfying crunch. I also enjoyed my sailed and baked potato. I finished with the cookie sundae. Staff was nice and friendly.</text>< pictures>

Had dinner here twice during our road trip. In the restaurant the first night and in the salloon the second. Wife ordered the sr3eak house Cobb which was absolutely huge while I had the New York steak. Came with rolls, beans, and a salad. A lot of food. The second night we both had tri-tip. Hers was fine, mine was cold.< /text>

<Text>Outdoor dinning in the middle of a pandemic was a breath of fresh air, literally. Polite staff. The chicken fried steak and mashed potatoes tasted like a home cooked comfort meal. I was not a fan of the blooming onion appetizer, but horseradish is an acquired taste. To each their own, the only reason I removed a star. Will definitely be a returning customer.</Text>< Pics>

Update... Still love it here!!!
Party of 3, sat at the bar. Place seems extremely loud but it's a bar. Waitress was great with her service. We ordered drinks and apps. Ordered the chardonnay,  rum and coke, vodka and soda, the bacon wrapped shrimp, the steak and mushrooms, fried artichokes, and the nachos. The food was warm and delicious. We frequent CHL after work to wind down and have never been disappointed! Thank you for great food and great service.< /Review>

<text>I was very impressed  by  the  way  that  this place was set up to accommodate diners during this difficult  time. I realize that they have mor space them some  other restaurants,  But they did make the outdoor area very comfortable,  there was even a TV. As for the food it was excellent and very plentiful.  My prime rib sandwich was loaded with meat and my friend's  steak house cobb was beautifully  prepared and it appeared freshly made. Our waitress Denise was very prompt  with our order and you could tell that she took pride in doing  her job. We went to a local restaurant  recently  were we had to ask for everything .  I want to support our local businesses during these times but sometimes  have not received  such a great service as we did here.< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

< Review>
Had dinner with my family here on Father's Day and it was delicious as always. The service was amazing, our server Megan was the nicest person we encountered that day. I was translating the menu for my husband and I thought it was so awesome that Megan took it upon herself to talk to my husband directly in Spanish, even though it was obvious her 1st language is English. She could have let me continue to talk for my husband but she chose to go above and beyond and speak directly to him in Spanish, she's amazing. Thanks Megan!<//Review>

Ordered for pick up, not satisfied... i ordered steak bites & side Cesar salad, simple right? Wrong because it was to go the quality & quantity was definitly not worth the little over $20 i paid. I ordered medium on steak bites & they were well done plus there was more mushrooms then steak, ceasar salad was this small box. Plus when i was 1st given the bagged order i noticed how light the bag was , they had forgotten the ceasar salad. Had to wait for the ceasar salad while the steak/ muchrooms were getting cold. And there were no napkins or utensils in the bag.  So overall not something I'll be doing again. Service was not great either, 1st person i told about the missing item walked away & didn't come back.< /review>

This is a great western steakhouse ! When I saw the pics of the dishes on google map, I decided immediately to try the restaurant during my trip in California. So we went in the Santa Maria location for dinner. And it was really good !!< /Text>

Delicious 😛
2nd time here & it is always so favorable 😍 this time I had a steak, ribs, & steak fries plate everything was yummy 😭 I fell in love with this place already.
& there strawberry lemonade 😍💕 no words to describe!!
Both of the times we went at night && had the same waitress we love her 💙 she made us feel at home & comfortable eating there. She is soooo friendly & nice. It looks like she enjoys her job 😁 alot!! I forgot her name but next time I'll make sure to get it to give her props on here  she is awesome.
But yeah I will 1000% recommend this place for sure☺< /text>< pics>

We arrived at a late hour. We were the last customers there along with a couple at another table across from us.  Our waitress was a super friendly and gave us her best recommendation. She checked on us periodically. The food was delicious. The atmosphere was pleasant.  But then of course we were practically alone in there. 🙂< /Review>

Right across the parking lot from a wine tasting room we went was Cool Hand Luke's BBQ. We went with a rather large group of people, so ordering was minorly chaotic. But our hostess did a fine job keeping everyone's order straight. Kudos to her. The dry rub ribs I ordered was quite delicious except a bit salty. Tri tip sandwich was definitely tasty. The steak with artichoke alfredo, can only comment on the alfredo, but that was pretty solid as well.< /review>

<Review>I want to like this place! Cool place, nice atmosphere, great easy location. Service was good. But I have been twice in the last 3 months and the food is just okay. Prime rib, ehh. It was so so! Salmon, I've had better. Coconut shrimp, I know your not a fish joint but please! Clam chowder, could you possibly add a clam? More appropriately called potato chowder. Sides, could somebody add some seasoning! I don't think I'll be back.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1578362640578, 'text': "I'm sorry you didn't like the last few meals you ordered here, Gary.

I expected more. My wife and I ordered the nightly surf and turf special. The lobster was good but the prime rib was like shoe leather. We asked for med rare and got well done, we also asked for mushrooms on top of the prime rib which they forgot. When I asked  the waiter she was rude and nasty and said it was extra. I  said it was part of the order. (Different waitress) She came back with a bowl of mushrooms, which she plopped on the table unceremoniously.

I have never complained about any food I have ordered before, but this was just to much for $105.00. I should have talk to the manager but it was late and I was to mad to talk to him right then. "Beware"<//Review>< time>

<text>Sitting outside in the chilly air, our heater shut down due to empty propane. They had no more propane! What!?. Food was low level and laced with sodium. This place isn't cheap either.</text>< Pics>

<Date>1561240962141</Date><Rate>5<//Rate><Review>Just went there yesterday, June 21st 2019 and our experience was fantastic. Our server was very polite and attentive yet gave his privacy and left us alone most of the time. When I asked another employee if he would change out our soup which was too salty for the clam chowder, he was very courteous and immediately brought us back a different type of soup that was more suitable for our taste. I also asked this other employee if he could bring us some extra bread and without hesitation brought us another basket of bread.
This is the type of service that will not break the bank of any restaurant yet goes a tremendously long way. Amazing that some places don't practice by this type of standard. But this restaurant Cool Hand Luke knows how to treat its customers hands down.
I'm generally not a big tipper, but our waitress earned her almost $10 tip by giving us an overall great experience for a lunch while we were out of town on vacation returning home.
I would definitely visit again when traveling through Santa Maria in the future< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>{'time': 1561477172713, 'text': "Thanks for being so generous, Geo!

I like this place, servers are always friendly and tri tip sandwich you can't go wrong with, maybe an onion blossom also! The iced tea in a mason jar is a nice touch to!I had lunch there 2 weeks ago.  The food was great and the service was too.  I was checking it out for a group of us.  It's thumbs down for the group because the music was ridiculously loud.<//Text>

Great food!
Pretty ok prices!
Waiter was good and by quite a bit to check on us. I spent 90 to feed my family of 6. We ended up ordering too much and left with take home food.
I love the environment. Mason jar drinks made me think of my grandpa's house.

The only negatives:
Slight mistake on the order but fixed quickly.
The sauce for the blooming onion was a little watery.

I would definitely recommend it and would go back.<//Text>

Service was consistently good, the beans were great. I normally don't like stews, but I tried their beef stew and it was incredibly good and homemade.

I had their Cowboy Ribeye and it was flavorful. The baked potato was good and I had something called a Strawberry Pizza which was a thin piece of shortbread with fresh strawberries and cream and it was wonderful.<//Text>

Great steak, fun atmosphere, cute waitresses in western jeans. I enjoyed the trip-tip and my wife always gets the flank steak. It's been awhile since we've there so the menu may have changed, but if not then that's we'll have again next time. Oh, then there's the bar where you can start your drinking while you wait for a table. Another plus!<//text>

<Review>I came in yesterday with my friends and we were attended so great by one of the waitresses, I don’t remember his name but it was a young gentle man with a little beard I think, he gave great service and even though they had no filet he went to ask what we can do and made sure I was satisfied ! The food was so delicious when it got to our table, it was so fast, I highly recommend!! Definitely coming back when we come on vacation again< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<Rate>2</Rate><Review>This place was my personal favorite restaurant in Santa Maria until they went fully corporate. Since that happened business has fallen dramatically. Doesnt have the same feel as it used to. The menu went on a diet as well, removing my favorite item, lobster mac and cheese. Used to be a real treat. Prices haven't changed though.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>{'time': 1576620749342, 'text': "Jason, I'm sorry to hear your favorite Lobster Mac N Cheese is no longer on the menu. I assure you Luke’s Santa Maria has not changed to corporate. In fact if you give me a few days notice I’d be happy to personally make you a batch of that kicked up Lobster Mac. One of the perks of being locally owned :) As for our menu, our quality and value has greatly increased in the passed 2 years as we switched to hand cut USDA CHOICE steaks in house daily.  Come on back and let us earn those other 3 stars.  Shawn Van Pelt, Co-Owner"}< /Response>< gmap_id>

Incredible sustenance!

Pretty alright costs!

Server was great and by a considerable amount to beware of us. I burned through 90 to sustain my group of 6. We wound up requesting excessively and left with bring home sustenance.

I cherish nature. Artisan container drinks made me think about my grandpa's home.< /Review>

<Text>First off, the bar was amazing and the service was great. Having one extra server in there one Sunday game day would help. But overall it was a good time. The reason for three stars is the the table prep for the dinner I was having.

Went there for a family gathering and was say at a large table. Put my wallet and phone down on the end of the table, only to find when I picked it up it was sticky & slimy. Nothing was applied on the table and nothing was near it. Just gave me the idea that they do a quick wipe down with the same dirty yeah they use everywhere.

The food, came out quick and everyone was okay with it. But the table was a real let down.<//Text><user_name>Chad Christensen</user_name>< gmapID>

Unfortunately a poor experience this week at CHL.
Seated 10 minutes late, even with a reservation.
Steak ordered medium well and came out rare.
Ribs came out luke warm (mind the pun) and were just edible. Credit to management for handling the situation well however this still ruined the dining experience. The wifey did say the roast potato was especially good however pity it wasn’t with her main meal (steak).< /Text>

<Text>We have dinner at Cool Hand Luke's almost every time I visit my Grandpa. I really like the old west vibe they have going on. It's a rather spacious restaurant so there's rarely a time they can't immediately accommodate a party of four. More than that and you should make a reservation, but the back room easily handled our party of fifteen.

The food is hearty. I had a 9oz New York strip last night and it was seasoned to perfection. I had a side of mashed potatoes which left the plate looking a little colorless, but that's my fault. I should have gone with the mixed veggies.

Their drink menu is eclectic and has quite a few strong mixed punches for the connoisseur of brightly colored sweet cocktails that will knock you on your ass. Think long island but blue, pink or whatever.

The tap list is pretty good and the happy hour bar is welcoming. Getting across College Ave is a bit of a pain during rush hour if you're coming from the 101 south, but other than that there's not any logistical issues.< /Text>< Gmap_id>

<Review>I'm a local who has eaten there twice. The food is absolutely disgusting. We had a baby reveal with 16 people. NOBODY had anything positive to say about the food. To the contrary, the portions were small, much of the food was cold or undercooked, and overpriced. On my first trip, I ordered seafood that was rancid. However, the service was polite. For your own health and safety, please do not eat there.<//Review>< pictures>

I ordered to petite bacon-wrapped filets, medium rare. They came out to me medium well. They brought me to new steaks which tasted bland and they had a gray pallor.and one of the steaks, I found a rather large wooden skewer that was broken off in the steak, I was lucky I didn't bite into it. The whiskey peppercorn sauce that was supposed to come with the steaks, had more of a consistency of a lumpy gravy and tasted only of salt. The bloomin Onion that we ordered as an appetizer, was lukewarm to say the least and not crunchy at all. We also noticed, that the appetizer came out very quickly, as if it had already been made and was sitting there on a counter somewhere in the kitchen. The coffee that my friend ordered was bitter and I could tell that it was old coffee. Don't waste your time or money coming to this place. Well Cool hand Luke's in Santa Maria used to be very good, it has definitely gone downhill.<//review>

The Menu is small and ambiguous, not to mention false advertising. The host brought us different drinks and got our orders wrong then had the audacity to blame us for not reminding him.

Definitely a Western atmosphere.  With country music as background. We had prime rib and I added the coconut shrimp. You could make a meal of their cowboy stew alone. I brought it home. Service was good with minimal wait. Will go back again for a special meal. Above my budget for everyday.<//text>

As far as foodborne illness goes, it can be difficult to tell what caused it considering it can take several days for symptoms to show up.

Good service and food taste fine. For the bad  my prime rib was way overdone. The worst part about it was I've been sick ever since the night of the meal Thursday and it's Sunday today. I've had stomach problems food poisoning I'm guessing. I don't usually write reviews but it was my first time and definitely my last. I would never recommend it to someone else.</Review>

Service is usually very good. The bar games are pretty cool. Steaks are decent, but there are certainly a few other local places that seem to use better quality meats and can cook a better steak.< /Text>

Would have given it 4.5 stars if I could. I had the Whiskey Skillet steak with Bleu cheese added and a side of calamari and beef stew. The steak and stew were absolutely excellent; the calamari very good. The steak was ordered medium rare, but was cooked slightly closer to medium. Still excellent. Calamari was a tad on the chewy side, but definitely better than most. The whiskey sauce was served on the side as it should be, not on the steak and it was delicious. Service was prompt and attentive, but not overbearing. All in all, I give the steak a recommended must have, and the calamari recommended.< /Text>

Only average overall. Ordered Lukes western ribeye with the green beans and salad. Asked for medium rare, came medium well, very little pink at all. Somewhat tough and grissely on the cut.
The sauteed nushrooms and roasted garlic were excellent but not enough so to make up for the steak I only ate 1/2 of. Green beans side was also excellent, possibly sauteed in the mushroom butter. And the salad was only average, with watered down bleu cheese dressing.
Service was acceptable but not extra attentive, and since when does a restaurant not provide silverware by default? We had to ask for every piece of silverware individually.
Sad to say that even though the vegetables were great, I probably will not go back, and will choose the local non-franchise steak house instead.< /Text>

Steaks!!! Don't go to the road house, same price but so much better!
Food was all excellent and a good value for the price.
Service was awesome.
Atmosphere was good. Clean. Comfortable.

The bad:
Got flat ginger ale with my cocktail and the alcohol ratio was a bit low. Come on bartender, you know when something doesn't have the fizz!</text>< pics>

until SLO proper that has late proper eats.  In many ways, it is better
than downtown SLO since it is not packed with College kids.
It is also ideal for the traveler as a pit-stop.  Service is friendly & the
prices are far.  The Rib steaks & burgers are quite good.  It is one
of the better chains.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Food was super tasty.  Prime rib, mac and cheese, steaks, tri-tip sandwiches.  The beer selection was pretty limited though, even though they had good mix drink selections.  If you just want delicious food and/or mixed drinks/budweisser then this place is top choice.< /text>

<response>None<//response><Pictures>None</Pictures><text>We've been here three times and have left very satisfied after all three meals. Yes, it IS pricier than McDonald's or In & Out Burger, and that is because this is a top-notch steakhouse. Your steak is cooked to order, your fish is perfectly flaked, your calimari isn't too chewy or underdone. The lettuce in the salad could be fresher, but because of the amount that they serve daily, that would be impossible--they have to use bagged lettuce, like most every other restaurant. The beans you get to start your meal are hot and seasoned perfectly, as is your steak, chicken or fish, or even your burger (if that's how you roll.) We have not made it to dessert, not because it probably isn't great, like everything else, but just because we don't have room for it. We don't drink alcohol, but the tea is always fresh and the Coke is never flat or too carbonated. Hands down, my favorite place to eat a T-bone in central California.< /text><Rating>4<//Rating><date>1485072172451<//date>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Been several months since we were last there.  Tonight's dinner was very disappointing.  The wife and I had the $25.50 rib eye dinner, and both of the steaks were a mere 3/8" thick, and both had 30% fat.  Not the way I remember these same steaks a little over one year ago.  Tonight's price was also almost double in price.  Things have changed there.  Today's date:  2-2-18</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Thin steaks! Last 2 visits ordered the ribeye, VERY disappointed,  steak wasn't even a 1/4" thick. Won't be eating here anymore. Not worth the $$$ and the service isn't what it use to be.</review>

<Rate>1</Rate><Review>You can tell the chicken wings are frozen from a freezer they have been pre-coated the calamari is not fresh you can tell all the prime rib is made earlier in the day kept in a warmer and all the steak is either previously frozen like a tomahawk steak and all the meat they use for their nachos is previously cooked like steak from the night before all the lettuce is pre-packaged all the food is pre cooked and the prime rib is just warmed to your liking you can tell the tri-tip is cooked earlier in the day not fresh at all the chef there is need to take more pride in their cooking the side dishes are pre-made beware of eating there not worth the money there a better steak houses here on the Central Coast to eat at< /Review>< Pics>

(Translated by Google) It is recommended for those who visit Los Angeles by car. I am disappointed to eat the San Ted steak where I can make up for it all.
The steak is really 👍 (the soup is a little sour,

(Translated by Google) Super delicious food ... The restaurant was recommended to us by the employee of the travellodge St. Maria. The steak was excellent fried, the greetings from the kitchen, the bean stew was spectacular. Prices a bit higher, but according to the level of the food ... Highly recommended

Super leckeres Essen... Das Restaurant wurde uns vom Angestellten der travellodge St. Maria empfohlen. Das Steak war hervorragend gebraten, der gruss aus der Küche, der bohneneintopf war spektakulär. Preise eher etwas höher, aber dem Niveau des Essens entsprechend... Sehr zu empfehlen</Review>
