I want to thank Holly for her beautiful work. I came with an idea and she threw some more in and together we created this set. She's awesome.  I definitely recommend her!<//text>

<text>Mindy is amazing. I’ve been looking for a new nail tech and I found Mindy! So good. 10/10 will come back.  And they treated my 6 year old like a princess which at some places they don’t treat younger kids as nice. I’m really impressed!< /text>< pics>

This has been my to go place for a few of years now, but soon after Covid not only did the prices increased, but also started noticing that the girls would prefer to get paid in cash, nothing wrong with that but also the money does not even go the register they pocket the money and they give you a small discount or they used to give you a discount, per my last visit the girl even asked if I could pay her directly thru venmo. After thinking about it, I became suspicious, since it was not the business name but rather her personal account and the total was $100+ and of course tip. Am I wrong for feeling suspicious?  Other than that service is great, fast and clean.<//Review>

<Text>I went today for the first time to get my nails done at Vogue since they were offering outside service.  Big mistake they are not following  Covid guidelines.  Tables were 4 feet apart not 6 feet, did not take anyone's temperature, no gloves, the plastic shield between us was dirty, never sanitized anywhere in the 90 minutes I was there and lastly nail clippings were thrown on the ground not in the garbage.  No plastic shields for pedicures either.  I mentioned it to the owner he was not following guidelines and he just walked away<//Text><Resp>None< /Resp></record>

<text>I understand this is covid times, but the chair and wooden homemade stool was not correct for being 5"11. Was very uncomfortable..yet clean. Price was more then the massage chair..but some clients where around in the building. Didnt get that. Also after just less then a week it obvious she cut to have in grown nails sooner.<//text>< pictures>

I went to vouge nails to get a gel gull set and a pedicure. I am loving it. The pedicure looks amazing (and the seats massage your back). The gel gull set is all even, color matches my toes, she listened when I asked her to do something, there was NO PAIN. The no pain is a huge one for me because every single time I have gotten my nails done in the past I ended up bleeding. Not Here! I was amazed. The price is decent.<//Text>

<Text>Bumped up their prices and even though you go to get a basic Mani/Pedi you have to wait a while even with appointment. Oh and not to mention they had two different people work on my feet one to prep and another to massage/paint and then expected me to tip both. Which I guess is smart on a business aspect but is it really necessary??? Haven't been back since.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Vogue has been my go-to place for years - right price, excellent service (i dont mind waiting)... but recently, I wonder if it’s changed owners because I was charged $30 for a pedicure alone (not gel, just regular polish) ... thats the price a mani-pedi used to cost! Next time i go - if i do - i will ask abt the guy (Kiet or Kien?) who used to run tge place... havent seen him in a month. Strange.<//review>

take too long to assist you, dont clean the pedicure stations throughly and use the same filers on every costumer and use it on everyone. this shouldnt be done because I saw a costumer with fungus on their toes and once they finished with her, they didn't even clean or scrub in the tub she was using. are very rude to you. came in at 1:40 and barely got out at 4:10. very poor service. state board ahould reallt come and check this place out.<//Review>

The OWNER IS RUDE, mean and an animal abuse. I went to the Vogue salon today and the first thing owner asked me "what do you want", I wanted one person  to do both mani/pedi but response was I have to choose one and come back for the second since one person  not allowed to do both by the same person, which is crazy. The owner is so rude that ready to lose client for something like that. Then I noticed a gorgeous parrot in their salon and found out the bird didn't belong to anybody there. I wanted to call human society or police to get the parrot safe and get it back to its owner. The owner through a fit and get pissed with for wanting to help the bird and wanted to take care of it himself by chasing poor stressed  bird (somebody's pet). I called human society and they asked me close the door and wait for rescue to get there and get the pet safe and get him/her home.    The owner got pissed off, didn't close the door,  told me get the hell out of there, and it’s his business and so on. Basically I left, called human society to hurry up and  get there before he would do something stupid, since he was chasing the parrot and its was hitting the walls.....:(
Later I found out the bird was "gone" when rescue came. I don't know what he did with it......Rude, heartless, animal abuser. Didn't let me help the bird and behaved as the worst human being on the face on earth. Pretty much like hitting the dog with car and taking off leaving the pet die. I would never recommend this salon to anybody because jerks like that don't deserve to be in business. Don't know how sleep at night after that.
Bad bad bad.
I wish they would ticket animal abuses like that.< /Text><Date>1416698769332< /Date><Pics>None</Pics>< rating>

<Name>Brianna Brekke< /Name><text>I do NOT recommend this place. I had to wait 20 minutes (typical) but then during my pedicure, she cut off the tip of my left middle toe and it was bleeding for a bit. It hurt, as did the antispectic they put on. Toe is still hurting an hour later. I was not offered any reduction in the $25 mani/pedi price either although I think they were paranoid I was going to escalate on the spot.</text></record>

<Rate>4< /Rate><Review>(Translated by Google) Also, their service is different. It's clean and very special. However, I feel that they are seeing people in their work procedures. Each has its own opinion. It is normal for me. The reason is that the nails they make are very good and very serious. But the fancy pattern on the nails is not so good. No art, the painting looks unnatural. I hope to improve.

(Original)
还可以，他们的服务是与众不同。好干净，也很特别。可是她们的工作程序我感觉到是见人见志。各有各认为。依我本人来说是一般般的。原因是他们做的指甲是很好，也很认真。但是画上指甲上的花式图案就不那么D好看。没有艺术性，画上图案看上去不自然。希望能改进。<//Review>< Pics>

Unlike so many contemporary or industrial-style restaurants these days, this one actually had comfortable and cozy seating and warm and friendly service! I loved that the menu and wine list were tucked inside old books, but more than trendy decor and music at the perfect background level, the food was absolutely fantastic! I had the chicken and goat cheese salad and then a charming little desert of ice cream that was just the right portion. Very satisfying and very pleasant atmosphere!</Review>< Resp>

<text>Discovered this urban style restuarant that offered brunch, lunch and dinner. Nick was very welcoming and helpful with the menu and we enjoyed meeting the manager and bartender who served us delicious mimosas!
We opted for the couch and our table enjoyed window view of their patio dinning.
I'm not a burger person , but I copied my husband and ordered their gourmet burger wow! We look forward to returning to sample other menu items.
Kid friendly with wheelchair access.  Great for all ages.<//text><userid>108029453629741243798< /userid>< Resp>

I met a girlfriend for social hour on a random Wednesday. I arrived early and was greeted perfectly at the hostess desk who directed me to the bar.  The bartender, Corrie, proceeded to take excellent care of me, and my girlfriend when she arrived. The drinks were delicious,  the meat and cheese platter outstanding and the service friendly and comfortable.<//text>

<Text>Farm to Table meets a trendy Soho style backdrop...

Food and service 5/5
First off the food is locally sourced and organic...I know what you are thinking you’ve heard that before...and in this case the food and the service lived up to the hype. First off the service here is super friendly and knowledgeable. My wife and I came on a Sunday morning for brunch. We came without a reservation and they quickly seated us and a server was with us. We looked over the menu and decided on the Loco Moco, chiliquies, and a side of crispy potatoes. My wife ended up ordering the Sundae Coffee and I had just a good old fashioned cup of coffee. All of the food was exceptional. The Loco moco gravy was super flavorful just the right amount of savory with the rice and the patty was tender as all can be. We finished off our brunch with a hot skillet cinnamon roll. All that I can say is that it is a like a cronut meets a cinnamon roll. It was flaky, soft, crispy, and rich all at the same time. All and all the food was very solid and right on par.

Service and decor: 5/5
As stated before the service was top notch. Our water glasses were filled up constantly and the wait staff was always coming to our table to make sure everything was going as planned. The decor is tremendous. Almost one half of the restaurant has this beautiful glass garage like door that can swing open. Giving you the feel of being outdoors but at the same time being indoors. You definitely feel like you are at a small exquisite cafe but at the same time you feel like you are in downtown SD or maybe in the Hamptons. It’s a great space!

Final thoughts...
Prep Kitchen really hits it out of the park. Upscale modern feel with homegrown farm to table food. You feel like you just stepped out of a small town and into the trendy big city. If you are in the San Marcos or North County Area definitely stop by Prep Kitchen it will be worth the trip.< /Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN-WkpXP_j4W4SaCyXsLMJjrpckTr5V0cn1ClrV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOXQzvByimtc7QC1D-piJR2PenJ0R5YCciFiVoz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMzO1d99TPpjCt6XQjt55PahnYUMW2-nrR-1SxP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMorWLvM7sYvcqrhDFtWxzDaAKMtgyt8EWePkd0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP9z4ADo7SCHDsVB3Cgz-qifSw1VLL2TEbx2tKC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNy7EaGWZNS_wacbrPMHrGYrtiSQt229DXTj5AK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPzW08jczEMNzQFlrm1utNSLNzFFBLq34L7mSna=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80db8bf08f877223:0x5b574dce9e1136e0<//Gmap_id></record>

Made the trip to San Marcos just try this place which had very solid food all across the board.
A) The Shrimp Tostada was packed with flavor and a spiciness that left my mouth with a delicious tingling.
B) I typically don't enjoy thin fries but these were perfect and came with a burger cooked just right.
C) The Portuguese white wine, Vinho Verde, was served chilled and was great for a summer dinner.
D) They also have McConnell's ice cream, which is pretty good! OH and don't forget about the affagato, it was excellent, reminded me of affagatos I've had at Eataly in NYC!!!< /Text>

<text>Made a dinner reservation for ten people weeks in advance for a workplace holiday get together. Received a call today informing me the restaurant has been "bought out" that night.  Today is Monday, our dinner was scheduled for Friday. I was told they called last week, but they did not leave me a voicemail like today. Schedules are set, people have babysitters, lives are arranged for the group to get together. Can't find anywhere to make a reservation now on a Friday night. Thanks a lot Prep Kitchen San Marcos. This San Marcos resident will no longer be dining at your establishment.< /text><name>Jeremy Nalwalker< /name>< Rating>

<Text>Wow really disappointed, really not good. $14 for a scramble that was literally three bites.
I don't know if our waiter was new, he did not seem new- but we had to ask for salt, pepper and jam at a brunch place? There was only two other tables there and everything took forever.
Oh and they ran out of expresso beans so all we could have was the bad coffee. Very pretty space the rest was all lacking.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

I was very disappointed with the experience we had here.  I had been to the Del Mar location and loved it!  At this location though it was a completely different experience.   It is way overpriced!  The service was not good.  We had to ask for things several times.  We ordered brussel sprouts that finally came after our meals came.  Also I found a hair in my sandwich,  which to me, is a deal breaker.  The good things were the manager was very nice and the place looked cool, but other than that, not impressed.   We won't be returning!<//Text>

<text>Was underwhelming, wasn't bad but just didn't have any specific punch. I ordered the Chicken sandwich which tasted good but could have either had more djonaise to give it more kick or pickle to give it more acid. People I went with ordered the Shortrib, was a lot of potatoes and the meat was over cooked becoming somewhat tough. Overall not a bad experience but just not memorable.</text><user_name>James Stewart<//user_name></record>

<Review>We dined outside for Sunday brunch and unfortunately had to ask for our food to-go because of the amount of flies swarming the entire patio. They were crawling all over the silverware and napkins left out on each table and there were dead gnats on our plates. We had 5-10 flies dive bombing our table at any given time before we even had our food. The issue is being addressed but the patio should be shut down until resolved.
The Wyagu slider and sandwich were delicious! However, I was disappointed with my expensive crab cake benedict. The crab was tasty, which says a lot coming from a Maryland girl, but you only get a half plate for $18. That’s ridiculous.
The inside looked lovely and the servers were very nice. Unfortunately, the flies will keep us from dining outside and the prices-to-portions ratio will keep us from dining regardless.</Review>< pics>

<text>This is my third time at this restaurant, which has very good food and service.  At 50 degrees outside and all the doors open, it was warmer to sit outside next to the heater, than inside the restaurant.  However, because the heater was being shared between two different groups, it was not enjoyable and I don't think I'll be going back  until next summer, when it's warmer and I can enjoy my food and drink in a comfortable setting.<//text>< pics>

<Rate>4</Rate><Text>I've eaten here twice! The first time it was amazing and the server knew all about gluten free. This last time, unfortunately the severe didn't seem to confident on gluten free. They brought me the wrong dressing and it ended up have soy sauce. Luckily I tasted it and don't want another bite. When I questioned him he said no it was the right one. When he checked with the cook he indeed brought the wrong one. Luckily I didn't get sick and knew it didn't taste like a lemon vinaigrette. He apologized but the restaurant needs to educate their servers more on this allergy. Also they changed their shrimp ceviche. I personally like the old way they served it better on the tostada. This is obviously a personal choice. I might give them another chance in the spring when they change their menu but definitely will be super careful when ordering.< /Text><name>Summer Labayen< /name></record>

Brussel Sprouts... better than any in San Diego except The Patio on Lamont, we ordered 2. Crispy Tuna... great take on an Ahi Poke style plate, delicious. Geno’s Meatball... my dad walked around the table for more like we weren’t going to let him have more. Sliders... I want to buy a bottle of their homemade Banana Ketchup

Amazing all around! Service, food quality, atmosphere, friendly staff, table games to play like Connect 4. Come during Social Hour to try all the goodies we had!! Definitely coming back...

It is expensive but it’s worth the price and most likely not a concern for the type that would be attracted to a new establishment such as Prep Kitchen.</text>

Just like the other Prep Kitchen locations throughout the San Diego area, the food and drinks are phenomenal. A real treat on a Sunday morning are their Chilaquiles paired with a spic—make that a super spicy Bloody Mary... You’re tasted buds will ignite and love you for the rest of the day. You’ll be back again!<//review>

On behalf of my aunts who barely speak English, I would like to thank you for your service! My aunts were very happy with the treatment they got here and were very impressed by the Canada Dental Office. My aunt needed an emergency appointment after one of her fillings fell off and she was able to come in the next day. The Canada team went above and beyond to ensure she went home with her issue resolved. The doctor ended up staying at the office till around 7 pm. I have so much respect for people who take care of the elderly. I would highly recommend this place as I feel safe sending my family here :)</text>

This Dental office is the kindest, most caring and gentle I’ve ever been to. I had the best cleaning of my life here, and had major crown and root canal work done a few times and the quality and comfort level is the best. After seeing how amazing this staff is, I see how it’s supposed to be done (especially compared to my old place). I HIGHLY recommend this whole office for cleanings and hard stuff!</Review>

Now, after going here, I feel like an idiot. This place was great. Aesthetically pleasing and clean. But more importantly everyone was incredibly nice, accommodating, sociable, knowledgeable and confident. I personally had an awesome experience and wish I had been coming here more consistently. At the very least I will now. Better late than never! Can't recommend this place enough!

Side note: I'm not sure if this is a regular thing or not but on my visit I got a little goodie bag with travel paste, toothbrush and floss. Boom.</text>< Pictures>

I was lucky enough to be referred to this office by my orthodontist and I can honestly say I could not be happier. From beginnng to end every member of the staff was very kind and professional. I was seen within minutes of completing my forms-it’s wonderful to not have to wait at a doctor’s office. I had a wonderful visit with Dr. Minas-he was kind, patient, welcoming to all my questions and took his time to thoroughly explain all the finding to me. I also really appreciated that he never pushed to have more work done than what is needed. Overall, I was so so happy with my visit and happier to have found a permanent dentist-I came home and told my husband that I’ve officially found our permanent dentist! This office and Dr. Minas deserve more than 5 stars!< /review>

<Text>Aris Minas is the kindest man as well as being very upfront and honest—that goes a long way. Raymond Grigorian is very informative and straight up as well! I always tell people to visit this office and give these folks a try. I’m not easily pleased, so that is saying something. Leann, Erica, Christine and Anita are always friendly as well and make you feel at ease. Kudos to the ENTIRE staff!< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

(Translated by Google) Here they bought a phone, and they put in a guarantee without authorization, then we went to pay the phone payment, and then they cut the line, when the payment had already been given, and they put us in a payment system demanding the payment of the insurance that was never requested, we were told that we had to go before to cancel the insurance we went, and they did not want to cancel, that because the system was not working, after they had already increased $ 10 more to the account, and we went again, and we They said that we had to pay everything, and then they would reimburse everything, that because it had been an employee error, they paid everything, and now they don't want to reimburse anything.

I rarely post reviews for products online as I'm seldom impressed with a product enough to do so.  However, in this instance I feel compelled to shout this one from the rooftops!  I am the full time caregiver for my 64 spouse who I've been married to for 46 years.  She has Type II diabetes among other serious maladies, but her blood sugar drops dangerously low without warning, often in her sleep.  With the new Libre II device monitoring her levels in real time and sounding the alarm, we are able to promptly react before she goes into hypoglycemic shock.  Just as amazing is the predictive nature of the device that forecasts rising or falling trends of her lab values thus allowing us to adjust diet and other factors resulting using less insulin.  It is a game changer for us!  Finally, we are so grateful to Advanced Diabetes Supply for guiding us through the process of obtaining the device, coordinating medical records, insurance company requirements and keeping us posted every step of the way!  We dealt with a person by the name of Izzy who was professional, compassionate and kind. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts.  Please feel free to use any or all of this review.

Great place to get help with the incredibly high price of insulin and products for people with type 2 diabetes.  Helpful and kind staff they work with you to help get the things that you need. I recommended them to my mother in law. There are no hoops or gimmicks everything is very straightforward!! Thank you Advanced Diabetes Supply for helping my husband who is on disability when Medicare would not!!< /Text>

Service has been excellent.  The phone people are responsive and do what they promise to do. I’ve been using them for nearly a year, and on only one occasion, was there a delay in getting back to me.  They answer all of my questions and never make me feel that I am bothering them, even if sometimes I am sure I must be.<//Review>

{'time': 1622129908970, 'text': 'Greetings Pablo –\n\nFirstly, we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience you have experienced with our service. We appreciate your feedback and we investigate every review thoroughly to enhance our customer service to meet our patient’s needs.\n\nFor your initial order with us on 04/09/21, we received a transferred prescription. Our representative confirmed your order to be shipped which you authorized only sensors to be sent because you did not need a receiver or transmitter at that time. On 05/05/21, you contacted us to ship a transmitter however the transferred prescription we received for your initial order had just expired.  We reached out to your provider to obtain a valid prescription and confirmed your order. Unfortunately, we made an error with calculating your copay causing a delay with your transmitter order.  Upon identifying our error, we expedited your order to ship next day and tracking confirms your order was delivered yesterday.\n\nYour next eligible order for sensors will be available on 07/08/21 and your transmitter order will be available on 11/22/21.  We are actively seeking to grow our staff to better assist with connecting to our patients quicker over the phone.  You may also email us at customercare@northcoastmed.com and we can reach back out to you after reviewing your account.  Again, we sincerely apologize for the delay and appreciate you choosing ADS for your testing needs.\n\nPlease reach out should you require anything additional.'}< /Resp>

Absolutely terrible service. Not only is the phone wait time incredibly long, their suggested use of their voicemail takes no less than 24 hours and usually longer to get back to you.
I have been having an issue with my transmitter that (for some reason) was not sent with my sensor supplies. After 7 phone calls (and counting), I have still not received it. At each phone call, one issue is apparently addressed, but other issues are not. Then, I as the customer, have to continuously follow up to find out why I still haven't received my transmitter. Then another issue comes up that has to be addressed. Today my transmitter finally died so I'm back to finger sticks. I have been "guaranteed" that it was going to arrive several days ago, but still no transmitter. As a physician, my staff and I deal with various medical and medical supply companies, Advanced Diabetes Supply has been the worst experience I've had in 30+ years of practicing medicine. I spoke with my endocrinologist and she has stated that several of her other patients are having similar issues.</review>

<Text>Since using the Freestyle Libre 2 from ADS, it has changed my blood sugar ups and downs. Went from 7.6 to 6.5. Can see where I am at at anytime and can adjust. ADS has made it super easy to get my supplies, and reordering is a breeze! So glad I am able to work with them.<//Text>< Pictures>

This company lacks an ability to maintain records for refills on diabetic supplies and fails to ship in a timely manner with the claim that the insurance will not allow for processing shipments to ensure items are delivered.  Their hours of operation are limiting for folks who live in the Central or Eastern time zones.  So tired of having to chase down my husband's diabetic (CGM) supplies when promises have been made that they will be responsible for filling refills.< /text>

When I couldn’t get my Free Libre supplies for a reasonable price , I searched the website (Free Libre) , and was directed to Advanced Diabetic. This source has been wonderful. Although I live across the country, they’ve sent my supplies on time every time... without my prompting. The savings in cost are the best! No complaints here!< /Review>

There response to questions or needs are always positive with action. Humans answer the phone.  That makes a 78 year old feel wanted and successful. Thank you.<//review>

I am very pleased with the service and followup from Advance Diabetes Supply. They send my renewals on time and were very responsive the time I had a Libre that didn’t activate. Definitely deserve an A+ from me!!<//text>

When you do make contact with them, some are as rude as can be. If you get Emily to talk to you are very fortunate as she will go out of her way to help you. No communication back from them when leaving an email, so you have no idea if things are in the mail or not<//text>

ADS does a great job of sending out my Libra Freestyle sensors and test straps as needed.  They had some great support and suggestions when I was having issues with a couple of sensors giving me very low readings.<//Text>

I have only been with Advanced for approx. two (2) months and have received one (1) shipment of sensors, etc.---basically the starter kit.  I have also spoken to the pharmacist a few times and had a good experience with her; she seemed informed and knowledgeable. So, thus far, things have been copasetic and they aim to please.  One thing I must say is that the company should NOT outsource their phone-calls to places where English is not the primary language; it makes them harder to understand and which causes confusion and  lots of: "Can you repeat that please"  in a conversation.   Thank You,  Rev. Fr. Leonard Stark, ORC<//Text>

What everyone needs to do is complain to their MAIN insurance and state how horribly slow and how they don't answer the phone. Trying to get any resolution is nil to None! Somehow they have to be regulated in some way by a governing body. So need to file a complaint(s) to show how poor their service is. Companies can't survive on poor service. We need our supplies as it's usually life or death for most of us and they could one day be sued if they are found to be liable because of their poor service.</text>

ADS seems like a really reliable outfit. They do what they say they’ll do, on time and politely. One of their reps even went out of her way —unasked—to ascertain that my insurance  would cover needles for my insulin.< /text>

I started using ADS for my Libre sensors about 4 years ago. The first sensors were 10 day sensors at first, and now they are 14 day sensors, and better now the sensor Reader will alert one to either low or high glucose day or nite!
The service provided by Advanced Diabetes Supply has been great all of these 4 years! They have been there for me whenever I have need them. I would refer them to anyone along with the Libre sensors!</Review>

I have written 0 reviews ever. This company is horrible.

Dexcom recently switched their resupply provider over to this company. It has taken over two months for me to receive my products, and I am still waiting!!! They don't pick up phone calls, they don't return calls, they don't send out follow up emails.

If you are presented with the opportunity to work with ADS, say no and ask for an alternative.</review>

<text>I have been trying to get in contact with this supplier for over a week now.  On hold for over 20 minutes, then they NEVER call back when you request the call back.  I was completely out of my sensors and again no call backs after 7-8 phone calls.  This is a HORRIBLE, unreliable supply company.  I would tell anyone that is considering using this company, STAY AWAY!  It is not like our supplies are optional, they are the difference between life and death.  I  have now switched back to Byram!  I will be contacting Dexcom & Tandem to let them know the kind of suppliers they are referring their patients to!</text>< pictures>

<Text>I can't even begin to express my frustration at the incompetence of ADS. Case in point: In January 2021, I called them to update our new insurance. Diabetes supplies were not due to be refilled until March, so this gave them plenty of time.

On March 2, 2021, they sent their form text asking for authorization to ship and charge the card on file. I authorized it.

On March 12, 2021, I received an email from ADS, asking for the exact same authorization. I gave it, and asked why they were emailing when they texted for the same authorization ten days earlier.

On March 23, 2021, I called ADS to find out what was going on, because supplies were about to run out. I had to wait on hold for over TWO HOURS before I finally got to speak to someone, and they couldn't figure out what was wrong with the order.

On March 24, 2021, they called me on the phone to say that they had run the insurance verification TO THE WRONG INSURANCE. Yes, they had the correct insurance on file from when I updated it back in January, but they didn't use that one; they used the previous insurance. So now they had to run a NEW insurance verification. They assured me they'd put a rush order on it, so it should be back within a couple of days. I gave my authorization at that time for them to immediately ship it, once the verification was back.

On April 15, 2021, they called me to say that the insurance verification JUST came back (???) but wouldn't authorize a 90-day supply, which we've had for over a year. They didn't offer to send one month's supply. They didn't offer anything. Just a phone number if I wanted to call them back.

I called back, waited on hold several minutes, and left a voice message. With their track record, it could be days or weeks before I hear from them again, and meanwhile diabetes supplies have run out.<//Text>< gmap_id>

Very poor service. It takes forever to reach someone on the phone; they say they will call back and never do.  The personnel are very  pleasant when you speak with them but there is a huge disconnect then between ordering and receiving supplies at ADS. Seems like they need a total reorganization to gain some efficiency when they are dealing with such essential products< /Review>

Really.  Dexcom recommended these guys for my son's supplies.  Waited a month and no response from them when they were supposed to contact me in 4 to 5 days.  Contacted customer service and after an incredible long wait, I was told that my welcome call was still pending.  I asked to speak to a supervisor and told one would call me back.  Still waiting for that call back.  No way I am using these guys!< /Review>

<text>I wish I could give negative stars because this is the worst place I have dealt with in ordering diabetic supplies. First off it took an entire month to receive my Dexcom G6 order, 2 weeks into that when I called them to see what's going on, they claimed they were waiting on my medical records, even though they never said they needed them. Took another 2 weeks before they finally processed the order. They told me I would get a 3 month supply of sensors, and even said the dollar amount it would be, but when it shipped the invoice only had one box of sensors (one month) and I was only charged for a one month supply. When I called them again they said there was an error on their end with the order, but they wouldn't let me get the other two months until the first month ran out, and they would contact me at the end of the first month. Of course the month came and went and heard crickets from them. When I called them about the next order they said it would be at least another 10 day wait before they could fill again, even though I was already out of sensors. Fortunately I've found a pharmacy locally to handle my Dexcom orders now, and not have to deal with this nightmare. Judging by many other recent reviews, I'm not the only one with problems with this place.  Avoid this place if at all possible, I can't imagine dealing with this with insulin pump supplies since those are more important.< /text><pics>None< /pics><rating>1< /rating></record>

<review>VERY poor follow-through, VERY poor communication, VERY slow shipping of products. I understand that people are working remotely due to COVID, but if more than a year into the pandemic your business hasn't figured out how to communicate information even amongst co-workers in order to meet the needs of clients, the business is a failure. If you can find a covered supplier closer to home, I would recommend trying some place else.</review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

I have called three times on May 3. I followed their direction on the phone to hold my place in line and they would call back. Only time they called was at 12:33 and I was hung up on. I called right back and received the same message to press one and customer service would get back to me. No word from company so y called back and left a voice mail telling them I am not happy. I think people should contact their insurance.</review>

Completely inept. I have been trying to get my child's Dexcom order filler for over a month. They blame insurance and insurance blames them. I never had this problem when getting supplies straight from Dexcom.<//Text>

<Review>Would rate this 0 if possible. Insurance authorization on file since 4/7 I have yet to hear from this mediocre company after multiple calls. Hold times are ridiculous and when someone answers they keep saying authorization needs to be verified, even after I told them I am out of sensors and transmiter. Working with my insurance now to get Dexcom supplies elsewhere since this company is a joke!</Review></record></dataset><record>

My daughter has been forced to transition to this vendor after being with Dexcom.  They never contacted me and I have gotten the run around from them for almost two months!  At first they needed an authorized, then a signed prescription, then a more clearly signed prescription, then my daughters medical chart notes, then a new letter with the number of sensors rather than days.  I have bent over backwards getting them everything they have continued to request and here we are two months into this and we still have NO Dexcom.  I keep calling and still have not received the equipment we need.  Worst experience ever!  Kid's shouldn't be forced to go without when we ha e insurance and have even offered to pay in advance.  It's RIDICULOUS!!<//Text>

I do not understand how this company can continue to exist.  I have called 8 times during business hours, left countless voicemails and requested a call back.  Once they called and didn't even let the phone ring a full one ring before hanging up.  I had the phone right beside me so I would not miss their call.  I am now calling Dexcom and going to beg them for a transmitter.  This company should be out of business.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x80dc749f6002c2b3:0xe3458b1592fae094<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Noone ever answers the phone! This is my third month on the dexcom and for the last 2 months I get the refill text... and... I reply following the instructions and nothing! I call everyday sometimes on hold for hours.. Noone answers! I leave voice mail fir a call back - Nothing ever! Then on my last day of the dexcom I drive an hour to my endo so they can call and get through some how and ADS ships to me 3 days later... But my dexcom already expired! ..... Hands down the worst company ever! Save yourself aggravation and fund another supplier</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Date>1619730359229< /Date><name>jack pental< /name></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
We have received dexcom supplies from this company for last 10 years, the last few years progressively worse service. At this point I need to review to warn those trying to decide what company to go with, AVOID this company if you have any other options. They do not follow through with obtaining auths, never give an update if order delayed, I have to call and harass every time we need an order filled to get them to work on it. Takes 45 mins on hold to get some clueless customer service agent to answer and tell me they are short staffed and "sorry looks like no one started the authorization" from 1 month ago!< /Review>

<review>UPDATE: I ended up waiting 1:54:55 before speaking with someone in the Dexcom intake department. Unacceptable.

It is entirely unacceptable to wait on hold for 1:46:24 and counting to talk to the intake department! I am absolutely furious at how unprepared this company is to handle any Dexcom orders! Not having supplies literally endangers the lives of diabetics and this company can’t be bothered to staff their call center with enough people! I have better things to be doing other than waiting on hold for two hours or more!<//review>< Gmap_id>

This company is really bad at sending prescription refills.  They will wait until the last possible day to send supplies and they just told me that it was their bad for not sending my refills after 90 days, and that they didn't even send communication to notify they weren't sending them automatically.   They pretty much suck.  Just avoid them<//Text>

Awful. Slow, uncoordinated, lazy, ignorant... You get the idea.  If you want to wait for supplies for a month and deal with an hour wait on the phone every time you call while they give you the runaround, look no further than this company!< /Review>

Truly a great company! Do not know where I would be without them!  I do highly recommend them! My experience with this company has included  excellent customer service which is important for me. When handling  my personal health, it is important that any company I deal with has excellent customer service. Advance diabetes supply cares about me and have been very responsive with me in all my interactions. Thank you A.D.S. !!!</Text>

I’ve never had as much problems with a medical supplies company as I have this one. I have multiple authorization letters and EOB’s showing they’ve been paid but I’m still getting past due notices. When I call I can never get the same person so I have to explain everything again.  I’ve been promised multiple times I’d be called back regarding my bill they say is overdue but not once have I received a call back. I’ve always done the call backs and gotten the same answers each time.  So frustrated with this company. I wouldn’t recommend them to anyone</Text>

<Name>Jina Yi</Name>< Review>
**FINAL UPDATE**
At first, I was very unhappy with ADS customer service for the reasons below. However, ADS was extremely proactive in remedying the situation and now I am extremely satisfied. As soon as my insurance approved the authorization, ADS got my order ready and out the door. I believe that my initial experience was not representative of ADS as a whole and I applaud their customer service department for going above and beyond to make sure I could get my supplies as fast as possible.

**UPDATE**
So, I'm actually really impressed with ADS customer service! Less than one day after I posted the original review, a rep contacted me and helped me get everything sorted out. It turns out we do need some more paperwork (which I found a little frustrating, because I was told multiple times by multiple reps that they had all the paperwork necessary and all I had to do was wait), but hopefully that was the last of the miscommunication. They also apologized for the lack of communication on behalf of the company and even offered to overnight me some testing materials so that I can check my blood sugars in the meantime. This interaction makes me hopeful that my previous experience with ADS was not representative of their customer service. I don't like leaving bad reviews on yelp, but I think that a company that deals with life-saving medical supplies should be held to a higher standard than say, a coffee shop. I will update this review hopefully just one more time after everything works out and I actually get my G6 system!

I've been trying to get on the Dexcom G6 and my experience with Advanced Diabetes Supply has extremely been frustrating. The process of getting the supplies I need has been delayed multiple times because different reps keep giving me the wrong information. They even sent a text message that an authorization had been submitted, but when I called to check in, it actually had not been submitted. To their credit, every rep I spoke to has been very friendly. My experience is detailed below:

ADS: "We spoke with your doctor's office yesterday, we have all the paperwork, and everything looks good. We'll give you a call when things are ready."

Me: *calls to check in two weeks later*

ADS: "Actually, we need your doctor's office to send us a form so we can send it to your insurance. After we get that, it'll take about a week for your insurance to approve it."

Me: ??? then why did you tell me everything was good and have me wait two weeks for nothing??? *Has doctor submit necessary paperwork in less than one day. calls ADS to check in a week later."

ADS: "Yes, we have all the paperwork and we just have to submit an authorization to your insurance. I'll submit it now, check back in a few days."

**They actually sent me a text message which states that the authorization was submitted as urgent and everything should be approved in about a week.

Me: *calls back a few days later to check AGAIN*

ADS: "Your authorization hasn't been submitted.... Yes, I see that someone sent you that text message, but they didn't actually submit the authorization. I'll submit it now and everything should be ready in about a week."

Me: ??????? Your company literally sent me a text message that my authorization had been submitted as "URGENT" and that I would only have to wait another week. Now my process of waiting a week is starting over??

Extremely frustrating... will be calling back tomorrow to see if they actually submitted the authorization.</Review>

They were good for the first three years getting supplies from them but this past year and a half they have become so frustrating and useless. I have to call them all the time to make sure my supplies are not delayed and they process insurance on time. If I left it up to them all my shipments would be delayed weeks or months and with a CGM, especially pregnant, that is NOT OKAY. That affects my health and my babies. Their laziness and lack of organization is not something that should affect my health. Each time I call i get told something else by a different person. I have had the same insurance, doctor, and prescription for almost five years now. The only thing that has gotten worse is them and how they handle their customers.</Text>

This company is absolutely terrible . My daughter is Type 1 diabetic and has a prescription for sensors. She has no symptoms of low blood sugars and has had several lows during the day and middle of the night that we would not have been aware of except for her sensors.We have a great doctors office and great insurance. We never have any issue getting supplies or prescriptions EXCEPT with this company. Do Not use this company if you need to have your diabetes supplies sent on time. I have tried to give them chance after chance for over a year with her supplies and it is ALWAYS something and my daughter ends up going without her supplies for days up to weeks at a time</text>

Wish I could give zero stars.  I ran out of transmitters and called for a new prescription.  I paid extra to overnight it.  They sent it ground.  It's been four days and counting that I've had no transmitters.  I called to complain and was told it's "out of their hands."  I asked to speak to a manager and was told that the leads were "in a meeting."  Very convenient.  I'm switching suppliers today.</Text>

I would give them zero stars. They were supposed to send my son's glucose sensors 9 days ago. They have an issue with the prescription, according to them. The doctor's office called them right away, the person from Medical left 2 messages to talk to the supervisor, I have called so many times and I still don't know if they have fixed it or not. Meanwhile, my son has been out of sensors for many days. Very frustrating. I hope Medical change to a different pharmacy. 9 days already since they should have shipped them!!<//text>

I would give them no starts if possible. the bad reviews here say it all, long call wait times, give you the run around each time you need new supplies asking for multiple verifications via email, text and call. Completely inefficient and painful to deal with as a customer. the worst experience i have with any company.</Review>

<rating>3< /rating><review>I have talked with a couple of customer service reps that are polite and very accommodating.
Most if the time I can't get through to anyone to answer my calls and then when my call is returned I miss the call because I am hard of hearing.  The fact I didn't answer my return calls was a complaint to me.  This person hadn't done any research on my account to see a problem before she began leaving a message and then she realized while leaving this message I had also sent an e-mail that  my order was late she said, " Oh I see the order is late.  I can send it out right away."
I'm happy she sent it out but it seems getting most of my orders is a hassle.  I would really like to know why in writing so if it is the doctors office I could have something to show them to let them know what the problem is.< /review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

As a former employee and diabetic ~ I would leave a zero if I could. This diabetes supply company not only refused to accommodate my diabetes during the COVID-10 pandemic, THEIR DIABETIC EMPLOYEE AT THE DIABETIC SUPPLY PROVIDER, they failed to notify me they had gathered my things and 'lost' them irretrievably. Garbage place to work and questionable service from an insider perspective.</review>

It was worst during this shelter-in-place period, when my wife called fives times, was disconnected four times before holding for 20 minutes whereupon she hung up in frustration.  She called a sixth time and used the company's callback option.  After a two hour wait, she inquired about her confirmed three month supply shipment that was scheduled to ship seven days earlier.  The company representative claimed that the company had lost its record of text orders (plural).  If true, then the company is irresponsible in not notifying my wife as these are important prescription products.  With great insurance and many choices, it's time to drop this dismal supplier, i.e. this company sucks.< /Text>< pictures>

This is a rip off company that supplies substandard glucose meters and they charge exorbitant prices. Disgusting products supplied by this company which are of lowest quality.</text>

<Text>At first, they did a good job. They shipped out my diabetic sensors and I had them on time. After several orders, they began saying there was problems with my prescription from my doctor which was never the case. My doctor has sent in everything that was required from the start.. I seen it myself.
Then, my orders weren't on time... they used to call or text me telling me it was time to reorder and would even provide the tracking number.
Now, it's no orders and no communication.  I've tried sending emails, phone calls,  text messages and no response.
They were supposed to send out an order last month and still nothing.
Very very bad and poor customer service.
Will be filing a complaint with their states attorney general.< /Text>< pictures>

There needs to be an option for zero stars. This is an absolutely HORRIFIC company.  My son’s supplies were due to come in (late). It caused him to run out of sensors and his transmitter had expired. He was suffering from a weekend of scary lows so not having his supplies was extra dangerous. When I called they said their system was down they’d get back to me (they never did) in a couple days. We had no sensors or transmitters!!!!! Thankfully I called dexcom and they told me I could call my son’s endo and get an emergency refill through our pharmacy so I did. When I called ADS to see where our supplies were four days later they said they couldn’t fill the prescription because I got it filled somewhere else. WHAT???? I had to get it filled somewhere else because of THEIR negligence. Needless to say I yelled and eventually talked to a supervisor and his supplies are supposedly on the way. The gross negligence, apathy, and lack of urgency for providing life saving medical supplies is terrifying to say the least. I am asking my son’s endo to change our supplier our next appointment. STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY! They can care less about their customers.<//Text>

If I could give this company zero stars, I would.. I don't even know where to start since Advanced Diabetes Supply has literally screwed up on so many fronts when it came to getting the proper pump supplies for my son. Now they refuse to field any phone calls or try to fix the issue. I would say they are on the borderline of being fraudulent at this point.</text>

I am shopping for a supplier for my Medtronic pump& Dexcom G6 CGM. I have had such bad customer service from suppliers that I HATE dealing with any & all suppliers. The problem is that Medtronics & Dexcom want to just concentrate on bettering their products, and they force us to use medical suppliers. PLEASE understand that if you would have great customer service, you could DOMINATE this business! All people want is good customer service! Read the complaints. They are the same that I have from other companies. SOMEONE IN THIS BUSINESS NEEDS TO STEP UP AND BE THE CHICK-FIL-A OF MEDICAL SUPPLY COMPANIES. Will it be you? Do you have the character, integrity and honesty to be the leader?  (I give you a 3 star because I do not want to hurt or help you since I am not a customer.)</Text>

I wish I could leave a no star review. Please please double think before going with them to receive your medical supplies. I have amazing insurance yet every 3 months when it came time to order my supplies they gave the run around each and every time. Asking for nonsense updates from doctor or insurance. My records were never updated despite me doing several follow ups. Do not go with with this company. I repeat DO NOT GO WITH THIS COMPANY unless you like waiting weeks, even months on end to receive your supplies.<//Text>

My son is T1D and receives his Dexcom Sensors from ADS. Not one order has came on time. We have duel insurance and not one order has gone thru the second insurance. They are supposed to be changed every ten days but they will only fill after a calendar month plus 5-7 shipping days! that's a whole week of no Dexcom! its beyond unacceptable! Its sad we have pharmacy benefits but thru Durable Medical Plan its cheaper and goes twords our deductible but companies like this have no care to the patients actual medical needs. I would not recommend to anyone.< /text>

THE WORST COMPANY EVER TO DEAL WITH AS A PATIENT & AS A REPRESENTATIVE IN THE DOCTORS OFFICE. DO NOT USE THEM!!
THEY WANT NOTES SIGNED BY DOCTOR, THEY GET THEM (AT THREE DIFFERENT FAX NUMBERS), THEN THEY COME UP WITH SOMETHING ELSE THEY NEED, THAT ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH. THEY SAY THEY WANT A LETTER, SIGNED BY DOCTOR, YET STILL IT ISN'T ACCEPTABLE. THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS AWFUL. IT'S DISGUSTING THAT THESE PATIENTS CAN'T GET THEIR DIABETES SUPPLY IN A TIMELY MANNER. THIS ONE PARTICULARLY FREESTYLE LIBRE. IT IS SUCH A SHAME. THEY NEED TO SHUT THIS COMPANY DOWN OR REVAMP WITH ALL NEW WORKERS AND MANAGEMENT. I WILL NEVER USE THEM, NOR ANYONE IN MY OFFICE WILL RECOMMEND THEM.<//text>

My cgm company sent me to this place for supplies and told me they will call within a week. It's been at least 2 weeks and I haven't heard from them. No contact whatsoever. I was told by my doctor that my cgm would be easier to get then my insulin pump. But yet my pump came in already. I use a different company for my pump and they were amazing. Customer service sucks. They never even called me about my insurance or how much the supplies would be. I am type 1 diabetic and trying to get healthy again and this place isnt allowing me to<//text>

Absolutely terrible experience and customer service.  To refill a prescription you have to work through an automated phone system.  The system asks for you to leave a message but the mailbox is full.  How can a company providing life saving supplies treat patients this way? Consider this a warning to avoid working with Advanced Diabetes Supply.< /Review>

Very frustrating company to deal with. I have to call multiple times to get receipts from copays, and deductibles. This time, the lady on the other end states I should have one more sensor from Dexcom, but in fact I am completely out. Now, I have to spend out of pocket for extras, purely because they don't have their dates correct. I was unable to speak with anyone "higher up". As a mother of a son with Type 1 DM, painful to go through this company to obtain his supplies.< /text>

This is the worst diabetic supply company ever.   Please take your business elsewhere.   I am a medical office manager and our office will not deal with this company.   They are incompetent and will lie to patients to cover for themselves.   The amount of paperwork they filled out is excessive and unnecessary.  Your fax will be lost, you will wait forever for supplies/ if you ever get them at all.  Medicare patients:   You have better options for supplies.  A grievance will be filed- ADS does not deserve a Medicare contract!!!!!!<//Text>

<Review>They sent me an invoice charging me a grandiose amount for supplies from last year, which were completely covered by my insurance at the time. I've been trying to get a hold of them repeatedly through email and by phone to sort his out, and no one is answering. This is horrible customer service -- I'm hoping a negative review will finally grab their attention.<//Review>< pictures>

<text>very poor customer service.  I cannot get my supplies in a timely manner.  This has become a second job for me.  My phone calls and emails go unanswered.  I am completely fed up. I would give them negative stars if that was an option.  if you have the option of using another supplier- do so and stay away from this company.< /text><UserId.>110231844686724935721<//UserId.><response>None</response><Rating>1</Rating><pics>None<//pics></record></dataset><record>

Terrible experience getting prescription for Omnipods verified by ADS/Northcoast Medical Supply. My doctors office sent all necessary paperwork over about a week ago and I have yet to receive a shipment confirmation from them. I received conflicting information from sales reps last week, was even told I was dropped by my provider which was not true (but the most horrifying thing a patient can hear), was not contacted with follow-up information as promised and have called three times this week to get in contact with them and have yet to speak with anyone. I've been stressed and worried all week; I literally need these supplies to live. I am livid and disappointed and would not recommend anyone use this supplier. This is a MEDICAL SUPPLY company and any and all issues should be treated professionally and urgently.<//Text>

Since 8-22 I have called and e-mailed at least 8 times... Once they said they faxed prescription request to my Doctor... They did not.  I had my Dr. fax them.  No response ... They have never called back as promised nor did anything they said they would do.  I am filing complaints with Medicare, Soc. Sec., and the Attorney General.  They should not be on the Governments list of suppliers when they are unable or unwilling to be responsive.  I am now out of supplies, waiting for these 'PHONIES' to do what they applied with the Federal Government to do.  Lee Thibadeau< /Text>

<text>ADS became my new provider of diabetes test strips in the summer of 2016 and it took months to get my strips.  Clearly the company was overwhelmed and did not have the staff to run this program effectively.  I spent hours calling and emailing to get the strips.  I ran out of supplies twice.  Finally when I decided it must be a fradulent company, I sent letters to the appropriate agencies.  Then a Sales person from ADS
called me and sent my strips but also many other products that I did not need or never use at a great cost to medicare my insurance and me.  And now I also have a pile of supplies that I will never use.  What a waste!!!</text>< Pictures>

Ordered  test strips and lancets almost a month ago.
Still don't have them.  I called and the girl on the phone had lots of excuses.
She said Dr. didn't send prescription.  I know they did !
Order still not shipped.
All of this BS didn't happen when I went to Costco and walked out with my order.
Customer service is lousy !<//Text>

I have worked with them for a bit more than a year now getting Dexcom CGM supplies. My account manager has always been very helpful, and calls before I am due for a refill to set everything up. Supplies arrive on time, and they handle all of the insurance billing. If you are a CGM or  insulin pump user, check these folks out.<//text>

I think this business is no longer operating.  I have been trying to reorder supplies since mid June.  I was PROMISED a shipment over a week ago.  I have called more than a dozen times, waiting on hold for over TWO hours without talking to a human, and have emailed them three times.  I am without my prescription right now.  My only conclusion is these guys are CLOSED and no longer in business.  If you are diabetic and relying on these guys you are way out of luck.< /Review>

I usually only write positive reviews, but my experience with Advanced Diabetes Supply has been so frustrating that I just had to write a negative review.  First of all, getting someone on the phone is nearly impossible.  If you leave a message, it takes days for them to return your call.  I am a Type 1 diabetic that uses an insulin pump and must check my blood sugar 8 times a day.  Even with sending BG logs and office visit chart notes, I have never been able to be approved to get the number of test strips needed.  This last time, after talking with someone at ADS at least daily for 2 weeks and my doctor faxing the same information to them at least 4 times, I have transferred my prescription to WalMart.  If you use an insulin pump and are on Medicare Part B to cover your diabetes supplies, do not waste your time on Advanced Diabetes Supply!< /review>

This vendor supplies my CGM sensors and transmitters, but they are closed on nights and weekends and have no customer service even during business hours. The only means of contact is by phone and email, and they do not respond to either. They claim to have a means to text them re status of orders, Rx'es, and shipments, but this means of contact has never functioned. It boggles my mind that such a company can be doing business with my BC/BS insurer as a supplier of critical diabetes supplies, but I guess having no human beings on staff to make sure customers are actually getting their products saves a lot on overhead costs.</text>

This is a HORRIBLE company to get supplies through. They have "forgot" to send my omni pod supplies on several occasions, and then offering to overnight the supplies for free, they still charged me for the over night delivery fee. I have called the company several times to discuss this and when I finally got a live person on the phone they told me it was processed and would take a few days. It has literally been 4 weeks, and no one at this company can seem to help me. They also "forgot" to send my supplies again this month, and did the same thing to me. They are very frustrating to work with, and cannot seem to figure out that people with diabetes need their supplies and cannot go days without it. WORST COMPANY EVER!!!!< /text>

< Review>
Having trouble reordering Dexcom supplies.  They used to call way too often for refills but now never call me at all. Trying to call them is tough and I'm not sure if they have a website reorder system. When calling I always have to leave a message, today because recording said they they are all in a meeting and can't answer phones.  Other problem is the number of times I have to renew/reverify my prescription causing me additional doctor visits and delays while getting all the redundant paperwor, this time just because it's a new calendar year.< /Review>

I am an insulin dependent diabetic.  I am now out of test strips thanks to Advanced Diabetes supply.  I have attempted for 3 weeks to get my 3 month suppply.  firwt it was because I needed a prescription trenewal from my doctoer.  then it was because he had not refilled it, and could I call him.  Then when I verified that he had refilled it, it was because he did not fill out the paperwork properly.  When I derterminied that was corrected, it was to be delivered next tuesday, When they determined today was also tuesday, it was to be delivered today.  I even called twice today to verify delivery.  Wrong again!  Now I can not test my blood!  There is something terribly wrong with this company, or is this personal?  Guess I had better find another firm to provide me with diabetic supplies.</Text>

This is the worst supplier I've ever dealt with. I work at a doctor's office. It's taken MONTHS to get my patients' supplies. I'm on hold with them as we speak.<//Review>

Horrible company! Every single time my supplies are supposed to be shipped they send only a portion of my prescription. I have had to reach out to my dr’s office multiple times for emergency supplies. I hate ADS.</text>

Great system for Rx refi;;s.  ADS send me an email notice that my Rx needs to be refilled  soon.  Refill request is processed very good, and the order is shipped out and delivered with minimal problems.  Great Service.< /text>

Pretty basic nail salon, nothing amazing or out of the ordinary. Massage chairs are a bit old. No water jets in the foot soaking basin. Technician tried to cut my nail downward which causes ingrowns but that's unfortunately a very common practice. Fairly clean as far as tools. They use an autoclave sterilizer and opened the tool bag in front of me. Removed my gel polish pretty well too without much cutting of my nail.

Wouldn't go again, although there's nothing glareingly wrong or at issue. It's just an ok place.</Text>

The staff was very nice. I came for pedicure, but I did not have enough time to paint my nails, they told me me I can come anytime. I did come 4 days after and they took me immediately and paint my nails. They did a great job painting. Pedicure was good just she could remove more of a death skin. Otherwise I will definitely come back.
Pedicure is $35<//Text>

Had my first pedicure ever, at Kayla's.
I'll never go anywhere else. I highly recommend this wonderful place.
And they do outstanding work. I do have my favorite, but if I haven't made an appointment and she is busy, I have found many other favorites. Go to Kayla's, you won't be disappointed.</text>

<review>My daughter and I each paid $50 for powder dip nails and realized that these two nail employees are just learning about the process. One of my daughters  nails chipped 2 days later.  Several of mine started to chip and lift near the cuticle.

The girl who did my daughters nails was on her phone talking during the whole process. Very unprofessional!!  I don’t recommend this salon for the powder dip method.  We won’t be returning for any more services!!<//review><Response>None<//Response>< Rating>

It was dirty and unprofessional. I actually left before my service started I felt so uncomfortable. If you're going to spend the money to treat yourself to a pedicure, this would not be the best choice.<//Text>

Another Update: 3/27/19- I continue to come here. I come with my mom and we get pedicures together. She sees Tracy and I see Rona. They both do such a great job. The attention to detail is superb. Rona really takes care of me.

Update: Thursday November 1st/2018: I just had a pedicure with Rona. She is great! What an awesome job she did. So now I can say that I really  like Rona and Tracy. Thank you ladies!

Previous review: When I've had my nails done by Tracy, she goes above and beyond customer service and care. Tracy is great. My mom has been going to see her too for a long time now and that is how I learned about her and this place. Nice place.< /Text>

<Review>I really like this place. I've been going to Kayla's infrequently for a few years. But now I've become a regular thanks to Katie! She really does a fantastic job with my pedicure. My feet thanks her every time I wear my tennis shoes….< /Review><Date>1412199252092< /Date>< userid>

<review>Made an appointment in advance. When I got there they were over busy and I waited 20 minutes. I still was no where near getting a seat so I left to go to another salon.< /review><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x808fb419647636b5:0x2375504d9e279569< /gmapID></record>

I've been going to Kaylas for about 4 years now. There's no $5 extra fee for any services. The up front price contains everything from the hot stones to the parafin wax to remove dead skin. The girls are always super nice and do a great job.<//review>

<GmapID>0x808fb419647636b5:0x2375504d9e279569<//GmapID><Review>This is possibly my first review ever, but given the nightmare of an experience I had. I owe it to myself to write a review.

I had heard great things about Kayla's nails so decided to try it for the first time. Unfortunately I had the worst possible experience. Here are the major points:

For starters the place is crammed and crowded.

I booked a manicure and pedicure in advance but despite some therapist sitting idle, the two treatments were not done simultaneously.

The therapist did not speak any English.

The therapist used a rotory grinder and decided to grind the top surface of all my nails. Which I have never experienced before. My usually thick, strong and healthy nails are now thin, brittle and lustureless.

My nails have an unusual pain in my nails and one of my nail beds has a blood clot below the surface so I am asauming my nail beds were damaged in some way.

Seriously how bad can one simple Manicure/Pedicure get?! I am amazed! So ladies not sure about you but I'm avoiding this place like the plague!</Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
This place is THE best.  I've been a customer for several years for pedicures and gel/shellac manicures.  Katie is my manicurist and she is an absolute gem.  I've had mani/pedi services in high-end establishments in many major US cities (NYC, Chicago, SF, Miami) and abroad (Paris, London, Dublin, Munich, Frankfurt) and Kayla's rivals the best of them for quality and service!< /Review>

I went for breakfast and ordered the chile verde, egg and cheese burrito. Absolutely amazing! The pork was tender and succulent; a true testament to the amount of effort they put into every dish.</review><username>Andrew<//username><Date>1552497387125</Date>< userid>

Rudy’s is one of my favorite spots in Santa Barbara! I’ve been here around 10 times and the food is always fresh and delicious! The staff are wonderfully pleasant and welcoming. Seriously, they have the best burritos you’ll find in town.</text>

I highly recommend this place. The service is great, happy clean environment. I am gluten free and ate the soft tacos made to how I wanted them with a side of rice and they were delicious. My husband is vegan and got the enchiladas (there’s a nice size vegan menu) and said they were delicious. The portions are big so come hungry. Friends got the chimichanga and nachos and the portions were huge and I was told they were delicious. They have several different sauces my favorite was the chunky tomato. Others with me got the churros and loved them, they come in six. If you are gluten free, vegetarian, vegan, or have no dietary restrictions you will be satisfied. We were in Solvang and came to SB twice and ate at Rudy’s for lunch. Highly recommend!</Text>

This was an excellent recommendation for authentic Mexican food. Cooked to order. Located in The Mission district. Known for their salsa bar and it did not disappoint. We loved all the salsa choices as they offer an extensive selection. Well priced.</text>

<time>1604807864578</time><Review>Me and my bro went here for a late breakfast today and each got a b-fast burrito. They were 8 bucks each and we were both completely satisfied. They also have some legit salsas to go with whatever you order. It was our first time there, but we already decided the next time in SB we gotta do Rudy's again! Well worth it.</Review>< Rate>

Honestly surprised about the hype.  Our food was pretty average and definitely nothing special.  The huevos rancheros were disappointing and the chorizo that I added on was weirdly sour.  Definitely not a returner for me.<//text>

Ordered two combination burritos plus two soft drinks came out to / $31, it was 70% Bean I found three pieces of pork no rice tons of sour cream and very little guacamole horrible....
One soft drink was horchata ice i  swear the rice flour was burnt.
I will never eat at Rudy's Presidio again I hope the original restaurant is better. This restaurant calls for a thumbs down.</text>

Very good food. I got the wet burrito de carnitas and my husband the original burrito de asada. Both meats were very well seasoned, the side of avocados was fresh, the salsas had a great taste. A little pricey ($30), but worth it.< /Text>

<Review>I only went here because the place I really liked had a line going out the door. So I wouldn't make it back to work on time. It was okay, the mole that they used on my burrito clearly came from a jar. So go there if you have to.</Review>< Pictures>

One of my fav' places to get a quick, affordable bite to eat in Santa Barbara. Their food always tastes fresh and delicious! I especially love their Chicken Taco Salad (house-made vinaigrette is so good!) & Chicken Enchiladas Verde. Also appreciate that it is locally owned and operated. Great for breakfast too!< /Text>

Rudy's serves good food at reasonable price for a downtown restaurant. I was disappointed in salsa selections: I usually like both hot and medium salsa so I tried both of the medium salsas. Both green and red medium salsas had ok flavor but had an after-bite (for ~10 minutes) on my tongue that made it difficult to eat my otherwise delicious chilli relleno, rice and beans. I understand $1 for chips, but is not usual to charge for chips at other nearby Mexican restaurants.< /text>

< Review>
Like the other two locations, absolutely delicious! Restaurant has a good vibe. Kitchen is out in the open in the front. Only downside is that they don't have the avacado or the Chipotle salsas! Chips are made fresh. I highly recommend the chimmichangas! Location of the restaraunt is cool, downtown, right off State Street, near a historic location. Walking distance from many shops.< /Review>

First time here. Got two soft tacos - the carnitas one was excellent, the carne asada was somewhat dry and had minimal flavor - the salsas were good and and helped. Worth a second visit.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) Bad service, I was highly recommended this restaurant and encouraged me to take my family to eat there. There were no people and we were a group of 6 sat down and not even a "hello, good afternoon" grocera which was attending. We sat down and were never educated in telling us they know: Here they have to order in the box. Well, we stopped and went to ask with a bad attitude, he told us if it is ordered here. We decided to go better and give a good tip to another restaurant. Businesses like this should pay more attention to the service or bring new people with better education. Bad experience.

Mal servicio, me recomendaron mucho este restaurante y me anime a llevar a mi familia a comer ahi. No habia gente y eramos un grupo de 6 nos sentamos y ni siquiera un "hola, buenas tardes" grocera la que estaba atendiendo. Nos sentamos y jamas fueron educados en decirnos saben: Aqui tienen que ordenar en la caja. Pues nos paramos y fuimos a preguntar con mala actitud nos dijo si aqui se ordena. Decidimos irno mejor y darle una buena propina a otro restaurante. Negocios asi deberian de poner mas atención en el servico o agrrar gente nueva con mejor educación. Mala experiencia.<//Review>

< Review>
I was greeted nicely even while busy and a walk in, they still were able to get me in. My chair didn’t work but they offered a discount next visit for that. They were very professional & nice! I love the work they did for me! Beautiful nails and toes ! So happy with my visit there !</Review>

Had a great experience at this salon! I came from Sacramento To visit family and made an appointment for a fill and a pedicure! I love the diversity of the staff! It was a very welcoming environment! Nathan worked on my nails and we even tried dip powder! They came out so nice! My pedicure was great too! I will definitely come back when visiting family again!< /Text>

<review>Great service but they couldn't get the foil to stick on my nail for some reason. Then they just left it like that. Or tried to. And my nails only lasted 11 days. Didn't get what I wanted to begin with and still charged me for all the work I didn't get.<//review><UserId.>101623999342249299096</UserId.><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

They were also professional and they do great work.
I am very pleased with my nails and pedicure. I will be going back to their place of business as a permanent customer.</Review></record>

I would rate it 2 just because I got my nails done there and it wasn’t that great. The nails were crooked on my thumbs and they sides wasn’t even painted all the way. I don’t think it was worth the paycheck. The lady was super nice though but it wasn’t worth the paycheck.</review>

<Review>I had a great experience here. She was very talkative, she did the amazing free hand art work I requested. She asked questions to be sure it was what I wanted. She also did amazing eye brow work I requested also. She made me feel  like a valued customer. I will come back.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Extremely dissatisfied with the service. I was told it would be an hour wait before receiving my pedicure. I left and came back to the salon and was seated and my feet were placed in the water. I sat there for 30 minutes waiting while the pedicure technician next to me took her sweet time hand fanning her clients clear coat of polish. I hate to make this about race but in my 29 years of life I’ve never seen a pedicure technician fan a client's feet when there were other client's waiting. It's absolutely disgusting to be so disregarded in a country in which I serve, to protect people of all race and ethnicities. The owner told the technician to service me and also asked her to hurry and she still took her time, that's intentional discrimination.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Last year during the time I was looking for someone to cut my ingrown toe nail carefully as I am diabetic I met John, whom carefully removed my ingrown toe nails. I have continued going there for pedicures with John whom I call Dr. John👍🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼😊
I recommend Starlight nails and spa👍🏼💫</Review>< Date>

Things have really changed and turned around with this place under the new ownership. I have been coming here for almost 8 years. Nails here are excellent. They have a great staff! Ariana and Abby are fantastic and very friendly see them whenever you come here! Also they offer waxing simple they don’t think our the brows they keep them nice and natural.< /Review>

They Made me wait almost two hours past my scheduled appointment time, and did a bad job on my full set. Waste of time and $60.< /Review>

<text>I read so many good reviews so I decided to go in on Sunday for a pedi. There was a 20 min wait so I sat outside the spa, I could see inside since they have large windows. As they dismissed a customer that aslo got a pedi the man wanted to sit me in the same chair as the previous customer WITH OUT SANITIZING first! I asked him "oh you don't sanitize after every customer? and he said yes we do" I told him i just saw someone leave from this chair and no one sanitized it! He just looked at me like he didn't care and I said ok we'll no thanks I'll find another place! I was so grossed out and disappointed!</text>< gmap_id>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>It used to be Mollys but this place has upgraded. The bartender at night on the weekdays is awesome. She makes all her customers feel appreciated and wanted in the bar. The place is spotless clean and many beers and liquors to choose from. The best place to go to when you are in Barstow. I would give 10 stars but it only goes to 5. Thanx bartender...< /text>< pics>

The bartenders are beautiful and very friendly especially Jeni and Raina. The only place i come to when I go to Barstow. The place is clean and a wide variety of alcohol. Must go to see for yourself.</Review>

Only reason I didn't give  5 stars is because they usually have one register open and the line takes forever band when they do open another register it's never clear whether there is one line for all registers or one line per register it gets really frustrating when you and other people think there is one line and then someone just walks up to the other register.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

The Bloomington location is big and has lots of selection. The new craft area is well stocked and this location tends to have a ton more party supplies and toys.</Review>

The staff is knowledgeable and friendly. I accidentally left one bag behind after shopping there I realized it called the store manager had already found it and told me he keep in the office and I can pick it up at any time. I swing back through that night so thank you and got my stuff. Good looking out.< /review>

<time>1509081204804< /time><review>Since it is in a area with really has no other stores this was a good place to have a dollar tree. They have lots of things you need to use every day from cleaning supplies, house hold items, pet item, crafts, food and freezer food, etc. They just need to stock more on the freezer foods they sale out too quick and there line can get long they need to have back up.There cashier are very friendly & helpful.<//review><rating>5< /rating>< userid>

The store is much better than the Fontana store, way better selection. They need to get a grip on their employees though, some guy was being fired while I was there and he was throwing a fit, he ended up getting his job back. It was very uncomfortable to be there with that going on.< /text>

< review>
better to go in the morning night time its a mad house i made the mistake buy going here in the night only one cashier line all the way down the aisle and a fight broke out between a customer and the manager very scary for my child the customer was asking the manager to go outside so they can fight never again will i go back in the night again. Update: very poor customer service I unfortunately visited this place at night I just needed to buy a couple of things 20 mins before closing time through out the time I was there every 5 minutes someone over the intercom was pretty much constantly reminding there closing and I get that they want to go home but it was excessive what upset me the most was over the intercom we were all told if we were not in line by 9pm ( which is closing time) we were not going to be helped me working in retail that's a No No yes you close your doors at 9 but the customers in the store show be aloud to shop I am not saying take there time but dont be rude learn how to provide customer service approach the customer and kindly say "we are now currently closed us there anything I could assist you with" with this happening just makes me want to travel just a little more ways out to another dollar tree</review>

The store is well merchandised but.... Trying to check out is ridiculous. Never more than one register open and a huge line of people. Why have more than one register it your never going to open them. Frustrating</Review>

Great food and reasonable prices.  The only thing I have a problem with is they have you wait outside if picking up a Togo or delivery order.  Instead of asking, I feel like they demand you to wait outside.  Customer service could be better.  Over all though, the restaurant is worth going to.<//Review>

We stopped by Benny's on our recent trip to Los Angeles and WOW, what a treat! This is a hole in the wall place with decent parking available. They do have a few tables inside and some outdoor seating too.

When we got there, they were working on a LARGE takeout order, but that did not impede them getting to our order on time :)

We ordered a few dishes and all of the dishes were really good! Quantity was decent too and the family enjoyed our meal here. So much so that we were back again for more of their good stuff!

Huevos Rancheros
Breakfast Quesadilla
Breakfast Burrito
Guacamole and Chips

Service was very friendly and efficient too. A great place for decent food :)< /Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMrm0Y0g4NHpYCPVSvEdkjo2rCd8FZRid9YTeEx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMk0sJeVxZ7YnHKhgEYos-NC0w9pbjjxWAmDJRw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMK-JpzJzPb2CL2qLGArMtVvXtRroileSrOxbkN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

< Review>
Staff was super friendly and helpful even when they seemed slammed by orders. Food comes in a large portion (ordered burritos), it came with chips and hot sauces, and I am a FAN of their homemade tortillas. They have a self serve drink station so I imagine outside of COVID there would be free refills when dining in. I just wouldn't recommend their horchata - it tasted a lot like flour (starch probably from the rice).</Review>

This is all the chicken, my soup had and i know cristian had todo with it because my order was made 40 mins late and he instead of helping he was laughing with cooks, and i know he did tell them to do this. He thinks he is the man there but he is not as helpful as he should be.<//Text>

Not bad for just under $9.00. This is their breakfast burrito w/black beans, bacon and a few chips. Had the bacon been on the crispy side, as I requested, 5⭐s would've been in the mix. Still, I recommend Bennys.< /Text>

<Review>Well sadly this was a HUGE disappointment. After reading all the great reviews I decided to give it a try... and am terribly disappointed. As you can see below, the carne asada in the tacos was very dry and EXTRA onions is simply a cover. The chips must have been a week old, very brittle and stale. My guest picked at her meal and said, “Taco bell is better than this.” Sadly, I’d have to agree. Like anything give it shot and I hope you have a different experience than ours. I will not return.</Review><Gmap_id>0x80c2b0ea7a7e0265:0x9d0ce9405491604f</Gmap_id>< Rate>

This review is solely based on their fish tacos alone.  I tried their other tacos,  but not as great as the food trucks on florence st. Benny's fish tacos are absolutely superb! I get the fried fish tacos and they are huge and laden with cabbage,  salsa, avocado,  chips,  chipotle mayo, tomato,  cilantro. I also noticed thyme and a hint of mint flavor to it. Great for your digestion too. I only wish you guys were available in nj and ny.<//review>

I always get the breakfast burrito here and have never regretted my decision! To drink, the jamaica is delicious and seasonally there's watermelon too.  My friends have tried the tacos & quesadillas and enjoyed them as well.  Deserving of the full 5 stars and worth writing a review for them.< /Text>

<Text>We work close to this place so we came here for lunch. It was packed with customers.

One of us got his order served after about 20 min. But my order (shrimp wrap) and my other co-worker's order were served after 45 min!! Completely unacceptable!!

The wrap + a coke for $18 is to much!

The teamwork between personel is well-organized and orders comes in all the time both from inside and lots from cataring. But the kitchen seems to be very unorganized as it took 45 min to prepare our orders. (See pictures).

The amount of salt in the food and souses were actually as expected/ok. The amount of suger and fat in food and desserts was also as expected.

The shrimp wrap tasted perfect. It was really delicious!

Here are some pictures I took.<//Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPEaqVPna7Zz3kOOigvE61gjnVv5XQpyLxixnPO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url':

I was pretty impressed by Bennys 's Hot Chicken! I got Combo #3 which includes a tender, slider, and crinkle cut fries. The chicken definitely has some heat to it and is incredibly crispy and tasty. The meat is tender and juicy as well. The coleslaw wasn't the best, but the pickles definitely made it much better. The sauce was primarily thousand island sauce so left room for desire. If you compare this place to Howlin Ray's however, I definitely prefer Dave's!<//review>

This spot has had a couple different names over the last decade. Since it became Benny’s, it became perfected. A local’s favorite in the Playa Del Rey/Westchester/LMU area.

I love their rotisserie chicken. More specifically, their soup. Which comes with chunks of zucchini, carrots, cabbage and yellow squash, served with a side of Spanish rice and tortillas. For under $10. It’s so good. My husband gets their quesadillas, they are huge and a little greasy but exactly what you’re looking for in a quesadilla.

Their chips are amazing, and this is one of the few restaurants that actually gives you salsa and guacamole with their chips.

Super friendly staff who make you feel as comfortable as possible. I went to pick up an order and while waiting, they said I could chill in my car which was really nice.

If you’re a fan of Horchata or Jamaica, you’re in luck here. I usually call in orders to go.

Over 10-Car parking lot located right next to the restaurant, also plenty of street parking nearby.</text>

<Review>First of all, the food is delicious! By far one of the best places in the South Bay!
I ordered online an hour in advance. Rather than wait, they prepared my food immediately. When I arrived, they recognized their mistake and insisted I wait ten minutes for a new order in fear that my original order was too cold (which it wasn't).
I was given two orders for the price of one! They clearly have a tremendous amount of pride in the quality of their food. You don't come across commendable service like this everyday. Gotta love this place!< /Review>< Response>

<text>Good food and plenty to eat! I stumbled across this place by chance with no regret! We had fish taco and carne asada. They both were yummy. I also like the fact that their horchata was not too sweet. This place is definitely will be on our must-revisit list :)</text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMPEXp-ShmzrXHOkMzwNOA6ArBEHaRcDpEqGvN0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< Response>

Recommend stopping into this place and enjoying a meal or takeaway.  This place was busy the whole time while eating here.  Staff helped out with choices and food came out fresh to order.  Some parking behind the place is available and some street is also available.  Portion allocation in relation to price is spot on!  Good value for your money.< /Review>

<Review>Usually decent service, though this last time I went my order was completely forgotten about, despite me reminding them 3 times. Ended up waiting 30+ minutes for a small order even though there was no line whatsoever. Pretty disappointed.</Review>< Pics>

So many great options across LA for Mexican food but Benny's is the place I consistently return to visit after visit. What's not to like? Consistently excellent rotisserie chicken to have on its own or that gets into the Mexican dishes. Fresh flavorful tacos, burritos, quesadillas, and enchiladas. Excellent sauces and side condiments. Delicious Mexican juices. Clean large outdoor patio area.  Today the choice for me were green chicken enchiladas. So delicious. I will be back again (as usual)! My friends had tacos and quesadillas. We all left happy.</Review>

I’ve had good and bad experiences here. The carne asada was pretty good. But my al pastor taco was pretty bland, this tortilla definitely wasn’t made fresh. Definitely a let down considering it’s almost $4 per taco. And my salsa tasted like straight tomatoes. Pretty much what I expect from a Mexican place in westchester. Workers are friendly though< /review>

<time>1608491688749< /time><text>Love this Place! I’ve ordered delivery from this establishment a couple of times and each time it been a wonderful experience. But Last week week customer service experience blew me out the water and i had to come write a wonderful review because thats how much i respect this establishment. Last week on the 12/14/2020 i ordered a shrimp burrito with 3 tacos thru postmates... They ended up giving me 4tacos(they gave me a shrimp taco by mistake instead of shrimp burrito i ordered).. I called and told them regarding receiving an shrimp taco instead of the shrimp burrito i ordered and paid for. They offered to make the shrimp burrito in which they delivered with charros literally like 20mins later< /text>< GmapID>

We have been coming here for a long time now. The poke has been consistent in quality and flavor.
They recently added the locals wasabi flavor. Give it a try.<//text>

We've been here a few times and the food is pretty hit or miss, depending on the menu item. The food is either terrible or great.

The burritos are flavorless and soggy. Additionally, the nachos are an absolute disaster. The nachos do not use a queso sauce as the menu description states. The nachos are just a huge wad of cheese and meat. There are minimal chips and the whole thing was an absolutely soggy mess. We ended up throwing out most of the nachos.

Conversely, we have had the tacos and quesadillas, which were much better. Both are large and pack a lot of flavor. The real bright spot here are the chirps, which are some of the best I've ever had.< /Review>

First time here tonight and it was just alright. We started with the nacho plate to share and it was a huge disappointment. It was basically a sloppy, wet, mess. The chips were soggy and it wasn’t evenly prepared. You had a pound of guacamole that felt like thick sludge on half, tomatoes chopped on the other half with a light sprinkle of sour cream, pinto beans in between and cheese somewhere tbd. The dish didn’t have much flavor. I’m glad I didn’t judge the restaurant solely on that dish. We then had the taco plate and the steak was cooked perfectly (a little too much onion for my liking but I know for next time) and the ground beef and hard shell taco was my fav. Awesome flavor! The rice was great, beans were ok too. I wish the dish came with a side of sour cream. My husband tried a rotisserie chicken taco and that was pretty dried out. I am surprised considering rotisserie is their specialty!< /text>

<Text>Food is great, but last time I went they had music so loud the guy couldn't even hear my order, and he took it wrong twice, I had to wait longer to get my order and he had an attitude when he couldn't hear me because their music was so loud 🤦🏻‍♀️ they try to compensate for the bad experience by giving me free churros which I appreciate, but I shouldn't have had to go through that in the first place.</Text>< Pics>

Food is great, but last time I went they had music so loud the guy couldn't even hear my order, and he took it wrong twice, I had to wait longer to get my order and he had an attitude when he couldn't hear me because their music was so loud 🤦🏻‍♀️ they try to compensate for the bad experience by giving me free churros which I appreciate, but I shouldn't have had to go through that in the first place.</review>

<Text>Chicken tostada:

Really good food, eat here often, a little pricey, but their portions are good, very generous with guacamole, fried flour tortilla on the tostada, also they have amazing aqua frescas</Text>< Pics>

Good food and plenty to eat! I stumbled across this place by chance with no regret! We had fish taco and carne asada. They both were yummy. I also like the fact that their horchata was not too sweet. This place is definitely will be on our must-revisit list :)< /review>

They now are these; tasteless garbage fries that have the flavor of a piece of 40 weight paper. They don't hold up to the standards of the rest of the menu.

I was shocked to receive them on my delivery. Called in, and even the employees there told me they feel the same way.

Not having it. BRING BACK THE SEASONED FRIES.< /review>< Pics>

You could say im a regular here  Great Food, I highly recommend this place/. Hidden gem! I was in the area and hadn't eaten anything all day. Fish tacos are one of my favorite dishes and they did not disappoint. Long story short: this place lives up to its name!! It may even be our favorite place we ate while in Los Angeles. I almost hate to review it and let the whole world in on the secret.  Delicious tacos. Simple place. Simple menu< /text>

I'm sorry but this was my first and last time here!! Costumer service is good the place is clean but the food is not good at all... I ordered steak burrito ...No flavor at all!! Super blend taste!! I'm from Mexico and this is not even close to something even close to Mexican food!! I'm sorry but you need to add at least some salt and pepper to the steak and vegetables!! .. the chips .... Something very simple!! They were blend too (or old) !! No taste No flavor!! Salsas no flavor!!!</review>

<Text>I am saddened to rate Benny's this low because the food is pretty good. However, I  just wasted $26 plus driving 16 miles round-trip to get back home and the order was half wrong. I was so upset because my husband really had heart set on eating Benny's and it was his food they got wrong. I threw the whole meal away. It will be some time if I should ever decide to eat there again. Very disappointed< /Text>< Date>

Been here countless times over 4 years. Food is always great. If it's your first time I recommend the tacos. My favorite being the Carnitas taco. Service is always great too. The few times there was a misunderstanding or mistake with the order they we very generous in making things right! Thanks, Mr. Benny< /Text>

I’ve been a devoted Bennys customer since 2017, and they have kept me alive with their food. During my move in, ready in 15min - sick, chicken soup delivered in 20min - just want to eat yourself into a satisfying (but no indigestion) food coma? Benny’s has got you. Both Venice & Manchester locations are legit. I order sometimes a couple times a week but at least twice a month. They’ll sometimes throw a healthy helping of chips and salsa or guacamole just because they’re freakin’ awesome. Horchata is good... Rotisserie chicken tacos?!?!! GIRL.! just go there. rn. 🏆<//review>

<review>One of the best local Mexican food restaurants in my area. The customer service is always excellent. The food is delicious, you can taste the quality and the care they put into cooking. They have some of the best chicken enchiladas and my mother-in-law when in town will only eat from Benny's. Any issue I've had with them, they were able to fix it and offer great customer service. It is a little bit more expensive than the other fast food Mexican restaurants, however, it is hands-down some of the best food you'll ever taste. They have fresh ingredients, it's well-balanced, well-seasoned and cooked to perfection. I've been going to Benny's for years now and ordering through Yelp and GrubHub. Fast delivery, delicious food and great customer service. Thanks Benny!<//review>< rating>

In playa vista the food options can feel a little limited, but Benny’s is an exception. The food is flavorful, especially the al pastor (in any form), steak quesadilla, and burritos. The staff are nice too, and even let us put in a last minute order as they were closing tonight. Happy to have them in the neighborhood.< /Review>

Long standing taco and rotisserie chicken restaurant that serves fresh food and has excellent service. The salsa bar always provides a fresh perspective and lets you know the restaurant is a legitimate Mexican establishment.  Great location and good parking as well.<//text>

Are here 3 times while I was in town for work. Food was always good. The 3rd time we showed up 10 minutes before closing without knowing and the food may have shown that but 5 stars knowing the other times were great.< /Review>

My favorite taco shop in the LA area. They have a wide variety of tacos and they are all delicious. They have good nachos. Also, they specialize in rotisserie chicken that can be had in various recipes and separately. Very close to LAX and decent prices.< /Text>

Great tacos. Seating is limited.

A friend told me about this place when we were looking for tacos. Ive never been so we decided to go with a couple of other friends.
I LOVE Tacos. This place is legit.
Lots of locals / college kids come here as well.
The tacos are affordable, very tastey.
Ive been craving this place non stop since we went.
Love the shrimp tacos, Barbacoa tacos are bomb. Pastor are great too.
Def check it out.
Staff is friendly
parking not so great< /Review>

If you are looking for an authentic Mexican cuisine, then Benny's Tacos is the place.  They have all kinds of burritos,  amazing enchiladas , fish tacos, quesadillas and more... My favorite, is the burrito bowl with black beans, yellow perfumed Spanish rice, well seasoned grill chicken and lettuce, top it off with house made pico de gallo and this delicious food is guaranteed to knock your socks off!

The manager, Christian, never too busy to smile with a big "Hello".  A friendly staff and great food serve at a reasonable price goes a long way these days...Enjoy!</review>

Yummy!!!!  Probably a favorite of Guy Fieri.  That type of place.  Not a dive, tough.  Picnic tables on an enclosed patio.  Order first, and they deliver to your table.  Food is fabulous.  Big Burritos and guacamole.  Going back for sure 😁🙂😁<//Review>

Delicious fresh food. The shrimp tacos are to die for. Even the chips are uber tasty. The fries could use seasoning, yet there are still nice and soft.  The classic chicken burrito with rotisserie chicken is delicious and clean in taste. Thumbs up. Thumbs up<//text>

I ordered two tacos, a Mexican Coke, and chips and salsa. My total order with delivery was $24+ so a little pricey for what I got. Tacos were lukewarm. The meat was good but otherwise the taco was nothing special. I ordered chips and salsa because it didn’t say anywhere on the ordering site that they already came included with your order so that was $5 wasted and now I have a tremendous amount of chips. I mean, it’s hard to mess up tacos, so I’d say they are not terrible, but they are also nothing out of the ordinary.< /Review>

<review>Chicken was perfect and the sides well prepared.  Everything was very fresh.  Patio was kept clean with tables being cleared quickly as folks left.  Nice salsas with the hot having the kick I was looking for.  I'll go back the next time I'm at LAX.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Rate>

This place was once the neighborhood go-to place for good Mexican food.  I'm not sure what happened but over the last year or so the food quality has been extremely inconsistent.  It's the luck of the draw now whether your food will be awesome or poorly made.< /Review>

<Text>We had heard about this place and finally made it for lunch.
I ordered the half chicken and it was flavorful and tender but nothing too exciting. The rice had flavor but seemed old.
The prices are great but it just was pretty basic. They basically got 2 stars because the food had flavor and the prices were decent.
I did not appreciate their desire to sweep AND mop the dining area that was half full of customers who were EATING.
Nor did we appreciate the two employees chot chatting by the salsa bar that we had to finally say excuse me to get to and basically how all the employees seemed to be distracted by conversation over the counter. Front talking to back and vice versa. There were about 7 people doing this, including 3 "other" individuals.
We won't be returning.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

I have strayed around the menu and haven't had a complaint! Only potential drawback can be parking,but U get served w non disposable plates and utensils!!! Highly recommend!!!<//review><response>None< /response>< Name>

Best chicken tacos in town! Salsa bar is clean and well-stocked. It’s not a sit-down restaurant, more like an order at the counter and sit down type, but everyone there is helpful and friendly. Thanks Benny’s!< /text>

< Review>
I have been meaning to try Benny's! Luckily for us, we just moved to the area and I would pass by this location everyday on my way to work.

At every Mex place, I would always order huevos rancheros. Unfortunately some wouldn't have it or at least would only have it for breakfast. Not Benny's! They have it the whole day. Mine even came with chips and guacamole. My friend got a wet burrito and said it was good. It was huge that he was able to take the half home.

I appreciate the servers checking up on us in case we needed anything. Special shoutout to Jackie for hooking us up!

P.s. they have a salsa bar and dogs are welcome in their semi-outdoor seating!<//Review>

Very clean, and very friendly.
Food (breakfast burrito) was really good. I prefer my bacon a little more well done than they made it,  but other than that it was great.
The bathroom was very clean.
Good amount of parking for such a small place.</review>

Great food and always fresh. Located almost evenly between pits college and Loyola Marimount. Service is friendly and always read to assist. Plenty of eating space inside and a nice salsa bar. They support doordash and postmates. Or just call ahead and pick up!<//review>

My boyfriend and I went here for dinner last night, it was awesome. Omar, at the register, was very helpful and friendly. The other employees were very attentive and made us feel, along with the atmosphere, very comfortable. The tacos...so good!! We were altogether impressed with the entire experience!!!< /Text>

Great rotisserie chicken, and fast, friendly service. My associates loved the burritos, and sides. The horchata was ice cold and a perfect compliment to the chicken.  Very affordable $10-15 lunch.</Review>

I cannot speak highly enough of Benny's. The food is so so fantastic, and the people there are always so kind and helpful. It might be a smaller restaurant that is more tucked away, but it is absolutely one of the best casual restaurants I have been to in the L.A. area. I frequent Benny's a lot and am always amazed at the quality of the food. Once again, cannot recommend this place enough!!!!!</text>

Bathroom door code 5050.

Pros:The food was great. I had 3 carne asada tacos. They came with chips and a little bit of guacamole on the side.

Now for the cons: They were a bit slow on the service for my wife, she had to go in and ask for her food after waiting about 15 minutes. My son and I were already done eating. She ended up getting it to go and didnt even get to sit and eat with us.<//review>

Haven't completed trying everything on the menu yet. However, everything I have tried so far has been great! You can't go wrong w/any of their tacos. The asada breakfast burrito by far my favorite!!!< /text>

<Review>We weren’t to hungry and order a whole chicken and two tacos. Very delicious rotisserie chicken. Rice and grilled veggies were perfect sides. Not your usual veggie side but was delicious! Fish taco was to top it off. Over exceed my expectations. Enough fish and hand made tortillas. Agua fresca were quench satisfying. Very of food options. Will be back to try other options.</Review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Cheap and authentic Mexican, fresh and down to earth. A surprising gem.

Has delicious healthier options as well, but I doubt that's why you came. Grab a cup of horchata and some rotisserie chicken tacos.

Good luck getting a spot in the parking lot, but you should be able to find parking within a block or so.</Text>< Pictures>

Expensive!!! For basic tacos. I've had better street tacos!! I couldn't believe how much it came out to be, when I ordered tacos for me and my niece. I figured they were going to taste awesome. Instead I got some rinky dink little tacos, hardly any flavor. Terrible. I'm feel bad giving this place such a bad review but, it was the worst.< /review>

Had our party last night..... I thought there would be a lot of food left..... Not even anything for the dogs.  We had chicken and steak fajitas.  Excellent... and they even gave me recipes for more sides to make.  The price was very good too.  5 thumbs up.  .< /review>

<Rate>1< /Rate><review>Very bed experience with this location. Actually love Benny’s tacos, were visiting location in Santa Monica since 2015 and still love it, every time when in SM going there for lunch.
However went to this location order California burrito (food still amazing thanks for cooks) but manager and worker were super rude claiming you can’t pour any soft drinks to water cups, can’t take extra Pico de Gallo, can’t take extra napkins and called me poor when I were leaving. Extremely unprofessional, that was one of worst experiences at the restaurant so far. Never will be back to this location. However will continue visiting Benny’s Tacos at Santa Monica, they don’t have that much limitations and customer service who don’t care about costumers. Thanks.< /review>< Pics>

The California and bean and 3 cheese burritos were huge and tasty also. They had very good rice and beans and they make their own chips. Good salsa bar. Friendly staff. We will eat here again before we head back home.</review>< Time>

This Mexican place is pretty tasty and has huge portions. The supreme fries were large enough to feed two people! The trick to bigger portions is to find inside the restaurant because the to go boxes are much smaller< /text>

That's from 8:30 to 10:30 a.m. the rotisserie chicken and soups are good too. The patio is small but nice, bathrooms are clean, all and all 5 stars on this place, some of the best Mexican food I've ever had. It's my go-to spot for Mexican food.<//Text>< pics>

As a casual Mexican food spot, you can't get much better than Benny's in the Fox Hills/Westchester area. You order at the counter, they take your food fresh to order to eat on their patio or take to go. It can take a little while to get your food, but it's worth it to get some fresh and delicious Mexican food.

From burritos to nachos, tacos and quesadillas, Benny's has all of your favorites along with a basic salsa bar. The tortillas that they use on their burritos are really exceptional and set them apart from other Mexican joints in the area.

It's great food at a fair price. Benny's is our go-to for fast Mexican food that isn't Taco Bell in the area.</Review>

Don't let this tiny hole in wall fool you. The tacos here are not only affordable, they are also big on flavor!

I found this taco joint via Yelp when I visited LA in January. I was looking for something close to hotel and this was only couple of blocks away. You see, I grew up in LA and there's no shortage of taco places around. What makes Benny's different from others is that they also specialize in chicken rotisserie. And that's one of the tacos I ordered together with the Carnitas and Al Pastor.

Now, let's talk about quality. The Carnitas was super moist and tasty and the achiote marinated pork from the Al Pastor was full of flavor. Surprisingly, the Rotisserie Chicken taco was also juicy and delicious. I know its just chicken but this was done right. Prices were reasonable too. Tacos started at $3.50 each and goes up to $4.25 for the shrimp.

For around $12, I had a satisfying lunch at Benny's. It's casual, people are nice and not stingy with the meat.<//Text>

<Text>Incredible! If you have not been here, go...today! The Rotisserie chicken is amazing and so are all the Mexican dishes. I'm working my way through the menu. Love the chicken enchiladas (made with the rotisserie chicken and their famous green sauce); all the tacos (carnitas, carne asada, fish (fried or grilled), and shrimp (to die for); love the nachos; love the loaded fries; the quesadillas are worth writing home about, too!  Go. Today. You can thank me later.<//Text><user_name>K. Elizabeth Meyer</user_name>< Rate>

When I use to come to this place it was it was great my food was good and always correct. Also the customer service use to be good. Over the time they kept on messing up my orders and the cashiers and workers became ghetto and rude. The last time I came the managers where talking loud and saying stuff about there staff slacking off and they don’t know how to clean right. I ordered the carne asada fries when I bit into it I  was chewing on a green ruber band , when I told the manager he tells me it usually happens when they cut the cilantro ruber bands fall into the food. BEWARE of the RUBER BANDS people!!!!!!!</Text>

We ordered quesadillas and Food would have deserved 3 stars (average). The most disappointing part was the delivery with 1h delay. The restaurant gave us a discount after calling but did not communicate with the driver who had to call the restaurant back to confirm. I needed to keep the receipt for my expenses and the driver refused to give it to me, saying that he needed it ! Unbelievable ! Very messy experience for average food, I will definitively look somewhere else next time.<//text>

< review>
Im a taco connoisseur. So when this place was recommended, i drove the extra miles to experience the hype.
The location is great but could use more parking...Especially with the option to sit and eat. I love the outdoor patio area.
The Aqua fresca drinks are delicious. The condiments bar is a huge plus. Customer service was great and service was pretty fast.
Unfortunately, i was not as pleased with the tacos. I ordered 3 shrimp, 3 Carne Asada and 2 watermelon drinks. My charge was almost $30. With that alone, i just knew my experience was going to be amazing. It was nothing to write home about. The chipotle sauce for the shrimp tacos actually makes the taco. I will stick to my local street vendors.</review>

<text>Hit and miss with this place. Have their great days, when my order is correct. Then have the bad times when things are missing, cold or over cooked(fish tacos) and have a burnt taste to it ( pancakes). I usually order while I'm at work so it's delivered..  But my first 5 times ordering were awesome, food came as ordered, But then I just felt like they started to slack...I have gotten wrong items such as drinks and tacos, then no avocado that I paid extra for or barely enough syrup for half the pancake.. It just depends who's working that day I guess. So this place is a hit and miss. But can't deny that when it is a hit the food is delicious 😌</text>< Rate>

Forget Taco Bell, forget Baja Fresh.
Hands down I'll spend my money here.
The food is phenomenal!
I usually get the carnitas quesadilla and my mouth waters. The pork is sooo tender and juicy it's like that slow cooked all day roast my mother used to slave over all day. THAT good!
The portions are massive, I almost always need a to go box.
Their churros are also amazing!< /review>

Not only a local gem, but more than worthy of a drive to eat their tacos, buritos, and other delicously prepared Mexican-style food. Very affordable, outdoor seating, and great staff add to the experience. Their fish tacos are an umatched must!</Text>

<Text>We love Benny's! The chicken & sour cream enchiladas are so delish. Topped with sour cream and avocado and sides of rice and beans. Couldn't even finish 1/2 but the ready was perfect for dinner. Taco plate works for lunch.< /Text>< pics>

The food is delicious. The counter staff is rude tonight. We brought 7 guests tonight for early dinner. It wasn't crowded, but they acted like it was really busy. $100. 00 tab for rude service that screws up the orders is not worth my time.<//text>

<review>The food is delicious. The counter staff is rude tonight. We brought 7 guests tonight for early dinner. It wasn't crowded, but they acted like it was really busy. $100. 00 tab for rude service that screws up the orders is not worth my time.</review>< Pics>

Excellent food and fast, friendly service. Everything from the burritos, tostadas, and rotisserie chicken is delicious. Be sure to try the orange salsa, it's smoky and amazing.<//review>

Stopped by for a snack at the new Santa Monica store. We are on a quest for Westside tacos. The carnitas tacos were great, the service needs to get it together, but was making a real effort. The carnitas were very flavorful and moist and as much meat as could reasonably be folded into the small tortillas.< /text>
