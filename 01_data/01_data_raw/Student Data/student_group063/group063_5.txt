I was coming here last couple times, pizza is good, everything is fast. The lady on the counter was very friendly and nice. I guess I have more questions to dominos pizzas web IT guys. I didn’t see any information that you have to bring your ID and credit/debit card, I left Eve home and I was so hungry and they didn’t want to give me my food just because of this stupid thing, and the pizza was like $10, doesn’t worth all of the my nerves< /Text>

<review>From the many times I’ve ordered here, I’ve never encountered a rude manager or driver. Seems like they got kids running the place. I already paid for my order but you have an issue giving it to me?! The manager angel needs re training on how to speak properly to customers. Will be making a complaint to the corporate office as well.< /review><rate>1< /rate><user_id>106265083693154771792< /user_id><Pics>None</Pics>< Gmap_id>

<review>Every time we order is either me or my husband and they have both my information and his, some days or nights he’s not here because he works so I’m the one that shows them his ID and car information and they never have a issue and give me the food WE PAID FOR or either he’s here and he shows them his information no problem but tonight the deliver guy was being so rude about everything mind you we have done it like this plenty of times and it’s never a problem for me to show his ID and card number they should know by now that we’re legit since we always order form them with the SAME CARD , we only have one car so my husband has me order some food so I can eat and now I have to order from someone else and wait longer because the driver Jonathan whatever his name is wanted to make it so complicated. I understand there is a policy but come on out of all the times I ordered already they wanna tell me something tonight and then isn’t it supposed to be contactless delivery so why do we even need to meet them to sign the receipt makes no sense ?? So unprofessional I’m never ordering from them again I’d rather starve.</review>< pics>

If there was the option of not giving stars at all, i would have selected that.  The worst dominos pizza ever ... this is the 2nd time i ordered pizza from you guys, and you guys never show up, if you guys cant do many deliverys theb you need to hire more drivers .. i waited more than 2 hours, and you guys never came.. definetly you guys are the WORST.<//Review>

<text>This was supposed to be a contactless delivery and I still had to greet the delivery driver at the door and sign with his pen. I specifically stated I wanted my items dropped off at the chair on the porch and directions were not followed. That’s deceiving to customer to say you’re concerned about their safety and offer contactless delivery.

I even paid with a card and still had to greet the delivery driver.<//text>< GmapID>

Since moving to the new location everything has gotten smaller and worse, the sauce doesn't taste the same the cheese is different and they literally gave me a the smallest Pizza in the smallest box even though I ordered a medium. Service was fast and staff was friendly. You won't get what you paid for if you come here.</text>

<Text>Worst place ever. As soon as I got enough points for free pizza they denied my debit card because it had my mothers name on it. It took them an entire year to notice it. They just didn’t want to give away a free pizza. AND THEY STILL CHARGED MY CARD! I tried calling them since they wouldn’t give me my money back. The lady was so rude. Don’t ever go to this fast food restaurant.<//Text>< pics>

WORST PLACE EVER ! DENIS RYAN HAS THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER ! Even had the cops escort us and our two year old out with our pizza because he wanted my wife to hold her card and  ID  while she’s holding my son in her arms really disappointed in this place and Dennis Ryan is the team leader which he shouldn’t be because everyone will end up acting jus like him if there trained by him and once again like I said really calling the cops on us after we gave you our money and still tried not to give us our pizza I want an explanation< /Review>

<Text>Plan on your order being made incorrectly. Then plan on having to drive to the store and asking for it to be remade while you wait on it. Then don't expect them to ever do or say anything to be accountable for their mistakes other than "sorry, we get busy". So if you can deal with about 2 hours time and driving to pick up a pizza you originally ordered as delivery from some chain place out of convenience, convenience that you give up as soon as you have to fix their mistakes, well, if you can get through all that, the pizza is OK.<//Text>< pictures>

Easily one of the worst Domino's locations in all of Southern California.

Man. I wish this wasn't the one near me....! I end up driving all the way out to Glendora just so I don't have to deal with the weirdos at this location.<//Review>

They do the gluten free pizza better than any other chain... bar none! I know, hard to believe. But I've tried them all. Orders are done right and delivered quickly... most of the time. The Azusa location gets it mostly right most of the time, and the mistakes are only very minor (lukewarm pizzas one time, slightly wrong toppings one time). Overall, I'm satisfied. Hoping the manager listens to the feedback and does a little more training with his team. Then they will be batting 1000 and customers like me will continue to come back repeatedly.< /review><Time>1505011545166< /Time><pictures>None</pictures><user_name>Geoff Hurte</user_name></record></dataset><record>

It looked like someone ripped the crust from just that one slice. When I spoke with the manager, She (sorry i dont have a name) advised me that she personally reviewed the pizza and it was "missing a sufficient amount of the crust". I had no idea missing any of the crust of a pizza that you pay for it "Sufficient". I did pay for the entire pizza. (My apologies on the crude picure)</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

<Text>Well I believe it's a great thing to be able to earn points towards free food but when you get your free pizza that was earned by points it seems that the quality of it isn't so appeasing to the eyes and may need to be checked out and corrected if it has become common👎😑😕the benefit of the doubt is what I will extend until it happens again...Ijs< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

A few weeks ago I placed an online order on a Saturday. An hour had gone by. I called Domino's and they said their was no order in there system. I filed a complaint. Domino's corporate couldn't do anything since it was locally owned. They did reach out to them. about 10 days later this Domino's contacted me. I wasn't able to answer the phone but a message was left. I got sent a coupon for a free large 2 topping pizza. I thought this was fair.

About another week and a half went by. It was Friday about 8:18 pm. I thought it was pizza time, but I wasn't going to use the coupon because I wanted something else. So again I went online. Placed an order, but didn't pay for it online. I planned to walk there. I live 5 mins. from there so I figured I would just use my debit card when I got there. I grabbed my debit and took a walk. I arrived, I said I'm here for my order, I handed over my debit card, and I was asked for ID. I don't know if this is a new thing but it isn't common to ask for ID when using your debit. I said I don't have my ID. I just grabbed it and walked here. He said I need an ID. Already frustrated I turned to my girlfriend to see if she had cash. She did not. Again we didn't think this was going to happen. So we began to walk out when the guy said, did you still want the pizza? I said, no I'm not going to walk home and walk back.

We ended up going to Papa John's. I place I've never bought pizza from. They just got a new customer. The Meats pizza was loaded with meat! Domino's equivalent is not as meaty!

Domino's was in the distant past at this time...so I thought. At about 10:49 pm I got a phone call from Domino's. They left me a VM. It said, we will be closing shortly (they close at 1 am on Friday, not what I call shortly). They said your pizza is ready for pick up. Why the hell are you calling me 2.5 hours after the order was placed and that late?

FYI, I won't be using that free pizza coupon. Done with this location. This was the same Domino's I used to ride my bike to as a kid every Friday for pizza night. I don't know what happened here. Sometimes when your dealing with people you need to adjust to the circumstances. Understand that not everybody is trying to scam. I should of heard something like, OK sir, don't worry about, next just bring your ID, they got us doing that now, thanks for coming, etc. That didn't happen today.<//Text>

(Translated by Google) Quick and efficient service, and the pizzas have a rich and delicious flavor, the bread crisp and with a good garlic flavor.

I had to wait 30 minutes JUST TO DROP OFF A URINE SAMPLE!!!!

I did not need to see a doctor or do any type of examination. They need to have a line or squeeze someone in who is just dropping off a sample. Especially during a pandemic and not having people waiting in a waiting room with 20 other people.

I was told they were short handed. I understand they had to enter it into the computer and have me sign paperwork. There just has to be a easier, faster way to handle drop offs.</Text>

There has to be a way to be able to speak to an actual human being when you call. I received an urgent emergency message from the city about an Extreme gas leak on the next street over from this building and I wanted to call ahead and check to see if you will cancel the appointment or if it's even safe to be in the area so I don't drive over for no reason. But no just an automated call service taking me in circles! It's lazy customer service.</Review>

<Text>We had an appointment,  and the simple blood draw took over an hour to complete.  This phlebotomists were very unprofessional and rude. I was honestly surprised that the type of behavior was even permissible in a medical office.  The employees were gossiping about the patients in the back room,   loudly,  loud enough for patients to hear. The phlebotomist who assisted us didn't seem to know what he was doing,  and even worse, he was very disrespectful. I highly recommend you choose another location for your lab work,  even if u have to drive a little further.  Save yourself the headache.</Text>< pics>

I will be brief as possible.
1. Waiting for a Saturday was only 20min.
2. Temperature was taken before entering.
3. Line outside office I'd say 10min.
4. Ladies were ALL professionals except one (very loud/unprofessional answering improperly to questions.
5. The woman who took my blood 👌💯 btw ( she has curly hair ) she made me feel comfortable where it was fast and quick!
Not sure where to unload a picture but if i figure it out i will post.</Text>

This office need to be shut down, no one answers the phone, the Afro American lady that stands in front of the entrance is rude and very unprofessional. We wouldn't have this in Orange county ? So we have to deal with ghetto acting employees? There's no number to call or write your complaints to, if you come late the lady at the door won't let you in. This place is sad.<//Text>

The staff is poorly trained. Even when you try calling the office you don't get through at all. The phone number listed doesn't work to access any department. How can people ask questions about accounts, labs, or mistakes.  Avoid this office.</Review>

<Rating>3< /Rating><Text>The parking area is a bit small and I went on a Wednesday at 9:15 a.m. However, it's a building with multiple offices so they can't help the lack of parking. The place itself is clean, but it was overcrowded and some of the staff members seemed unorganized. I was asked on 3 separate occassions to present my insurance card. Appointments are a must if you want to save time and get in and out. I was a walk-in and I spent a little over 2 hours there. . .all in all, it wasn't as terrible as I expected but the staff needs to do a better job of explaining to the patients how the entire process works. There needs to be structure.</Text>< pics>

WARNING***
I only went here because they open on Saturday this is not my usual location. I went early Saturday morning, the wait wasn't long which was great but...
I don't do well sitting up for blood draw and they didn't have a bed at this location. Another thing is I think I got stuck with someone new or in training because male nurse  left me badly bruised with blood all on the inside of my arm. Two weeks later my arm looks horrible and in terrible pain. Never coming here again I usually go to another location. I tried adding a picture of how bad my arm looks and it won't let me post it. Trust me not worth going here.<//Text>

My mom filed a grievance with the insurance company about wait times, insurance company looked into it and received paperwork from Quest from the day she went. According to Quest paperwork sent to insurance company, paperwork shows she was only there for an hour (which is false, she was there for over 2 hours waiting to be called). By the looks of it, Quest falsifies their paperwork, so beware, avoid this place if you can (if they falsify paperwork regarding wait times I wonder what else they falsify). If your insurance allows it, or if you pay out of pocket, I highly recommend going across the street to LabCorp, it's the opposite of this sorry of a place called Quest; they are quick, pleasant employees and very helpful.<//review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

This place has some horrible reviews so I wasn't to happy to go here but it really wasn't bad. I was there no longer than an hour for a blood draw. When talking to the nurse (nice lady by the way) she did admit it would get horribly packed. So, all in all, just be a bit understanding and I think the place and people aren't horrible as these reviews portray them. Give it a try. (I went on a Saturday)< /Text>

Quest should really get some employees, both for the Phone and for the inside of the facility. I spent 30 minutes on the phone and 20 minutes in the parking lot and didn't even get inside because some mean lady took my parking spot after I drove around for 20 minutes. Maybe they should get a parking structure. Maybe they should go out of business...</review>

Very Rude staff. Went to get blood drawn and they told us, "you better pay or we won't take you back." Really?! Who tf said we weren't going to pay. Very long wait times, staff just stands around talking to each other. Disgusting place.< /review>

Brought mom for labs. Horrible. Long wait. Rude and inefficient personel.  The worst part is that an overflowing waiting area created very ugly fights within the other customers.  By the reaction of the staff, the fight looked like normal business. A real shame how this office is managed.<//text>

<Review>I only came here cause my insurance sent the order to this lab and not to Labcorp where I only spent 20mins during the same time frame and day. Spent 2.5hrs here this morning for my son to get blood drawn. You stand in line to enter your info on a tablet. Then you wait until you are called so they can take in your paperwork. You keep on waiting until they called you.
The person drawing my sons blood did not know what she was doing and  although I was holding him, they had to prick him TWICE because she was very slow and wasn't able to get the needle in correctly. She had to call in someone else to do it , which she should've done in the first place.
The  office it self was HOT and stuffy.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

If tou come first tging in morning... long wait time.

Come after 11am in the place is empty.

Blood testing requires fasting, so everyone comes first thing in the morning. Dont do it.

Come later. And its all good.</Text>

<date>1460396724156< /date><Review>It is the worst ever. I wish if I can submit my comment with no star. I went for lab work today 4/11/16. I arrived as a walk in at 8:45 a.m. They called my name at 10:35 a.m. and they told me that they don't accept my insurance and I have to go across the street. I don't care if they accept it or no but my concern is why they told me after wasting almost tow hours of my time. The only thing can explain this that they are not professional.< /Review>< Name>

<text>Like others say, it's overcrowded, very long wait, rude staff that is not very good with paperwork. You as the patient/customer must explain what is going on to everyone there that you talk to because they do not communicate with each other.  This place makes for a terrible experience. Walking through the door is like going to a third world country..way overcrowded and chaos.</text>< Pics>

Waiting line on screen is incorrect.  One minute it said I'd be seen in 8 minutes,  next minute said 11 minutes,  and yet another time said 24 minutes.  It's supposed to let you know when it's your turn but it's incorrect.<//review>

(Translated by Google) Horrible I was seen by a guy named Mark for a blood test for my daughter. I spike it in both arms and I could not draw blood with an attitude that seems to be giving away services without manners. Enough charges me the insurance so that he also as I do not know what part they do not understand ..

Outstanding  service. Only one issue. I ordered the smoked  salmon with pasta. I had 1 piece  about an inch long of salmon? I would have liked a bit more. I searched my dish for more and there was none.</text>

<resp>{'time': 1620657976475, 'text': 'Dear Lisa, Thank you so much for your review. I am so sorry to hear that. Usually the chef put more than one piece but since the salmon is cooked and very tender is melting in the sauce and give the plate strong smoky flavor. Hopefully next time we could make it up to you. Warm regards, Trattoria Manager'}<//resp>< GmapID>

<date>1622179586953< /date><Rate>5< /Rate><text>Quaint Italian restaurant on Balboa Island's main drag (Marine Ave).  Old world decor.  Excellent and very attentive service by an older gentleman, who I presumed to be the owner.  Prices are very reasonable given the quality of the food, size of the servings, and the location.

The warm lightly toasted Italian bread was perfect, especially when dipped in olive oil and balsamic vinegar, and also when slathered with the whipped butter.

My wife had a seafood risotto, which was very much like cioppino over risotto.  Very tasty.  Her green salad was also quite nice, with crisp mixed greens and tomatoes, and a nice, light vinaigrette dressing.

I began with the warm chorizo appetizer.  This actually turned out to be almost a meal in itself.  An entrée-sized plate of thickly sliced chorizo and grilled bell peppers and finely minced tomatoes, all lovingly embraced by a light tomato-based sauce, this savory appetizer went down with ease, leaving me somewhat full, already.

My caesar salad was also excellent, with crisp dark green romaine leaves and a zesty caesar dressing that lightly coated the romaine leaves (just the way I like it).

For my main dish, I had the lobster ravioli, swimming in a creamy tomato-based cardinale sauce.  The soft little pasta pillows were packed with lobster and cheese, and were very yummy.

This was our first visit, and we plan to return soon.< /text>< pictures>

I’ve walked past it a ton of times doing laps around the island. Do yourself a favor and sit down for one of the best dinners around. Blew us away and keeps us coming back. Family owned and operated. Don’t miss out.<//Review>

Absolute favorite place on the Island to eat! Truly traditional, homemade southern Italian fare in a small, quaint, romantic space. Whenever we are visiting Newport Beach we will enjoy atleast 2-3 times a week.</Review>

This was the worst Italian food ever.
How you can mess up chicken Parmigiana and Rigatoni. Not to mention the delivery came with no cheese, no utensils and no butter for the bread. I am new to the neighborhood and moved in with no utensils still unpacking!  So tried eating the food with our hands and then just tossed it. Canned Italian would have been better.< /review>

My partner and I ordered the daily special of mussels and smoked salmon over penne with cream sauce, as well as some calamari. Was some of the best food I’ve ever had in my life, blew us both away. Absolutely fantastic, never before have I had to take a moment to savor each and every bite. Truly special!<//text>

<Review>It was like going to Italy. The atmosphere is authentic. We were surprised to see it uncrowded on a Thursday evening.  We were not disappointed. My wife and I each chose a different wine by the glass. Both were outstanding from the first sip. We knew we made a good choice for dinner!  The Cesar Salad and Garlic Bread were delicious. I was in the mood for the classic Spaghetti Bolognese which I rarely have but loved to the last bight.  The meat balls were excellent. My wife always goes with seafood. She devoured her Risotto.  It was a quiet spot excellent for date night or conversation.  I wish this restaurant was in my home town. I would become a regular!<//Review>< pics>

My goodness, where do I start?

I called 5 minutes prior asking if there was availability for two on Valentine's. The gentleman on the phone said "yes, come on down!" Walked in a little after 7 p.m. The lady addressed us and immediately asked if we had reservations, I replied "no, but I just called". This is a small restaurant of 11 tables, 7 inside with 4 on the front patio.  There were 5 empty tables when we arrived, 2 inside and 3 outside. She said that we could only sit outside. Throughout our dining, there continued to be turn over and empty tables available inside. Meanwhile, my elderly Mother with stage 4 cancer and I remain outside... OK fine. Strike 1.

Because we were sitting outside, my Mom ordered hot water to stay warm, the same lady (I assume the owner operating with her husband and the only food servers), replies with, "the kitchen is crazy, and there is no room to boil water"...hmmmm OK. Strike 2

Ordered the calamari for an appetizer, and it came out within reasonable time. It wasn't greasy, and the tomato sauce which accompanied it was good, but overly salted. The portion was very small and so were the rings of calamari...a bit shocking actually...
more like little morsels . Strike 3

Also ordered the Veal Saltimbocca which is one of my favorite Italian dishes. $31!!!!! First, it took more than 20 minutes to arrive, and the restaurant was half empty. The plate was laid 3/4's on our table with the edge hanging off. The veal was so thin and tough, therefore it shouldn't have taken that long to make.  It was so salty, way too lemony, and hardly any flavor of sage. The prosciutto overpowered the little pieces of veal...it was all wrong. Strike 4

I also ordered a glass of Chianti, which never showed, but appeared on my bill. When I pointed it out, the lady responded with, "dear, you could have told me". Sorry, that is not my job. Strike 5

In addition, our glasses of water were not once refilled, nor did anyone ask how our dinner was.

Unfortunately, I can't give zero 🌟 s. Not sure how this place has decent ratings and are still in business. I get they are a small restaurant in a touristy location, but maybe that's how they make it, by ripping off tourists who will never go back... like us. If you are charging those prices, there should be a certain level of service and quality. Sad.</review>

We took our German friends this summer and we all enjoyed it so much that we returned a short time after. It has a small, intimate atmosphere and our service was very good.  The owners couldn't have been nicer or more accommodating. The veal dishes were particularly tasty!  We will be back.</Review>< Pictures>

Reminds me of our trips to Italy. It’s not just another stupid pizza place. Simple, quiet, real Italian food and service.</Review>

Very pleasant, intimate ambience;  server/owner was affable, helpful and not at all pushy.
He was perfectly happy for us to split a salad appetizer and took the trouble to serve nicely on two separate plates.
Food was good.<//Text>

This little find is excellent!   Such a nice experience to be on Balboa Island, and have a wonderful dinner here.  The owner is very nice and very personable, and the FOOD IS EXCELLENT.  Very fresh, beautifully presented and he takes alot of pride in his quality and presentation.   The eggplant is the best I have had, but not always on the menu.  If you love eggplant, call ahead and if can make it, he will. Highly recommend!!< /review>

My date and I went after 8 and the owner served us, as the "OPEN" sign was lit, even though he told us he usually closes at 8 because it is dead on the island.
The food was marvelous; the chicken tender and the noodles perfect. My date had a Caesar salad, which had the perfect mix of vegetables and dressing, and I paired the chicken dish with a reasonably priced Italian Pinot Grigio.
I worked in various Italian restaurants and only go to Italian rarely anymore, because I am almost always disappointed, but this place will be where I go when I want Italian.<//text>

Great Italian food in a very intimate Italian setting! Not expensive in my opinion. Also, the restaurant is by the beach, so, you can let your food settle while walking by the scenic route.< /review>

I do not like that place!!!!
I'm surprised why it has too many positive reviews.
My wife and I ordered 2 salads and the main plate.
Salads were like fast food style I can buy the same salads at Burger King or Jack in the box... Salad had only leaves and 3 pieces of croutons. The main plate also was not good...
The waitress never come to our table to check on us.
We paid almost $50 for that horrible fast food style dinner at that place! Thanks God we ordered just one main plate.
Appetizer was also horrible. It has nothing to do with bruschetta, probably they never tried a real bruschetta....

I don't know any other good place near that restaurant but for sure it was a mistake to choose Trattoria.

Never again!!! It's better to starve!</text>

I went to the metal supply shop, not the recycling center.  They were great.  Serviced immediately, and I asked for the wrong stuff.  When I came back they redid my order for me without any complaints or comments.  They helped me load and off I went.  I would definitely recommend them.< /text>

<Review>If you are bringing large items of scrap iron you need to go thru the gate on Doolittle and follow traffic in a circular track that will lead you to the scale and one car at a time on the scale,while waiting in line  ask the yard guys were you should dump your scrap after being weighted saves you time when you are done  getting  weighted and if you are turning in aluminum or plastic you need to go and park your car on Davis and grab a cart or can then go inside .</Review>< user>

<Review>The place is always busy and it looks like it never shut down but it does. At times it takes about an hour or 2 to complete the process of recycling your load. But they only pay  .07$ per lbs. With a min. Of 300 lbs.   To get paid so be prepared before you go.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

After being a client of this place for over a year and continuously observing their practices I have found that the staff is very slow and tends to favour those clients who are not white and retaliate even when they are in the wrong. We have bent over backwards to be courteous to them and they will still make you wait if they dont like you or just are having a bad day. Very unprofessional and offputting. Use their services at your own risk.</review>

In the three times bringing valuable material to Alco I experienced the following:
1. Questionable weights
2. Inconsistent weights
3. Questionable claims of material composition
4. Possible material pollution on a load I asked to be returned because of claim of composition.
4 times a charm and I wont be bringing them anything valuable again.< /review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Pictures>None</Pictures><Text>You gotta be careful before they start weighting your aluminum cans or plastics bottles and check how many pounds they write on the paper, and the tare pounds too, because they always write more tare pounds and less net pounds than you bring , ex. In my case ,I brought 43.9 pounds of plastic bottles and they wrote only 43 pounds instead of 44, and when you know about it is "too late" because they already started the process.
Today was the last day that I go over there, so if you planning to go , just keep on mind all that.< /Text><user_id>113749241818744171647<//user_id>< Response>

Worse service,the first time I came at 11:30AM and I got sent back because the employ told that the place was closed and supossably on Saturday's the closing hour is at 12:00PM, and the second time I had 600 pounds of glass in black bags and I was only paid for 500 of them for the tare.

What A Lotta Pizza was this years choice for takeout to celebrate my birthday during the pandemic. The pizza, the wings, the antipasto salad, and even the ranch dressing were all fantastic. Wait... Did I mention they’re food is FANTASTIC! Yes! They may be small, but they are five gold stars above anyone else.</review>

Great food, thick heavy and hearty slices of pizza with a robust sauce that ousts the franchise competition and probably tops the local smaller shops. The Pastrami mustard pizza is honestly my favorite and well worth the try to anyone who hasn't had it yet and loves pastrami. Service is excellent and you can't go wrong with the value, its pricier than most but well worth the money.<//text>

Good for a quick no-work easy dinner. Good friendly service. Tip: We always order extra sauce and cheese, cooked well done. Comes out thick and rich. Add a green salad.< /Review>

Pepperoni sausage mushroom with extra sauce is the most delicious pizza here. Their sauce is amazing better than Domino's and all the others.< /Review>

<review>They are under new management and the place is great now. They do deliveries again and you won't find a better price point anywhere else in the area. Two large, two topping pizzas for 18.99 and delivered in 30 minutes on a busy Friday night. Try Pizza hut or Round table with that and you'll pay more than double that and wait and hour and a half for your food. Give them a try, the wings and garlic cheesy bread are really good too.</review>< pictures>

The pizza is good tasting and well priced. Where's the problem? you say? It doesn't seem to matter what you order from the website. You get what they feel like making that day. You want a supreme pizza but you hate pineapple, too bad that's what you are getting.<//Review>

<Resp>None< /Resp><Text>I think it's nearly impossible to articulate the way that Dr. Gray has impacted my life. After spending more than a decade of my life hiding my body from people and even trying to avoid it myself, Dr. Gray has given me the gift of confidence and comfort.

Dr. Gray is a skillful surgeon, but more than that he's a wonderful person and his office staff is incredibly welcoming and patient. He employees the most gentle anesthesiologist that I have ever met and his nurses genuinely take interest in everyone who walks through the door.

If I could give him 100 stars I would.<//Text>< name>

Had an awesome experience here for my breast augmentation.  Dr. Gray and Cherisse were helpful answering any and all questions before and after the surgery. Everyone made me feel comfortable on the day of surgery. Scars are healing nicely and my breasts look great as well.  Everything went smooth from start to finish here!<//review>

There is no one like Dr. Gray. He’s an artist. I have gotten my breast surgery twice with him and extremely thrilled both times. He also did my lip fillers and you can’t even tell I have fillers. All his work looks so natural!</Review>

We are grateful to have earned your trust!'}</Response><review>Words cannot describe how amazing my experience was, working with Dr. Gray and his staff. Plastic surgery is a scary thing, and they took all that fear and anxiety away. At every appointment I was greeted by smiling and happy woman in the front of the office. Willing to answer any question I had, with ease.  Dr Gray explained the complete ins and outs of breast augmentations. He told me what he does and more importantly, went into detail about why. I felt so much more at ease knowing what all my options were, and from there deciding which one I wanted and why I wanted to go the route I did. Gray took the time and was very thorough, while I tried on countless implants. The healing process was a breeze! From day one, I barely needed my pain pills at all. And I’ve heard horror stories, so I give all the credit to Dr. Gray. Not to mention my results are everything I wanted and more. I am so happy and I wouldn’t change a thing! I will definitely be going back to him if I need anything else done! He’s amazing!< /review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Its been several months since my surgery but if ever I have a worry or concern these amazing people always make sure I get an appt asap to be seen by Dr. Gray. I had a terrible experience prior to finding Bay Area Plastic Surgery and its incredible team. So any slight feeling freaks me out. They always reassure me and take the very best care of me. They also make me feel like I'm the only person they have that day, very VIP. I highly recommend never goin anywhere but here for any and all of the services they offer. Look them up!</Text>< name>

Hands down, best decision I’ve ever made to do breast aug with Dr. Gray at Bay Area Plastic Surgery. The confidence I’ve gained from this procedure was unimaginable and I’ve never been happier. I truly believe that I would not have gotten these perfect results anywhere else. Thank you Dr. Gray and Cherisse for the smooth and easy process.<//review>

<review>Dr. Grey, is a kind, honest and very helpful with all your questions about plastic surgery. I got implants 17 years ago and they still look great. I have never had any problems with them. I am older now and planning to have them removed by him because I trust him. You can trust him he is the best!< /review><userid>112355979733621508399< /userid>< resp>

I have been a patient of Dr. Gray's for over 20 years.  He is an amazing surgeon (breast augmentation in 1996) and an artist when it comes to surgical procedures, injections and other body work! I highly recommend him, he listens to your needs and does just what you want.  His staff are  amazing too, they are hard working, kind, and always have your best interest at heart.</text>

<review>Was referred to Dr. Gray by a friend years ago and was not disappointed. Great service from checking-in, to the consultation with the doctor. I was so happy with the results that I have gone back a couple of times for other consultations. Dr. Gray is very honest and will tell you if what you're requesting is even worth the money. Worth the money and I would go back if I ever need any other touch ups.<//review>< pictures>

I have seen this man's work over the last 20 years. I grew up in the beauty industry.  My mother did areola rejuvenation for breast augmentation and mastectomy survivors.
The exquisite work of Dr. Gray is a CUT above the rest.  I have had several personal experiences with him as well and was always let with beyond beautiful results. Besides being a leader in his artistry, hes a caring professional medical professional!
The women in his office go above their responsibilities to ensure the best possible communication, understanding and experience.<//Review>

Always a warm and efficient experience in Dr Gray’s hands. He is a detailed perfectionist and an artist in his work. Everyone he chooses to surround himself with in his well rounded team is kind, efficiently skilled and genuine. I always feel safe and confident in their hands. I am so happy to have found Bay Area Plastic Surgery Center. Doesn’t  get better than this!<//Review>

I was recommended to Dr. Gray and let me just say...I could not have been happier with my decision to come to him for my breast augmentation. His staff is extremely warm, friendly and knowledgeable. They worked with my busy schedule to fit me in at a time that was most convenient for me. During my visit, the whole staff was attentive to my needs, concerns, and questions. Dr.Gary is an amazing doctor. He broke everything down for me step by step as far as all my decisions from implants, to incision, and complications I should be aware of. After my pre-op appointment I was not 100% on my size and his staff made time for me to do a second resizing the day before my surgery. I ended up choosing 505 CC with a high profile. I feel extremely confident in my decision and am so happy with my results! I am already getting compliments on his work!I HIGHLY recommend Dr. Leonard Gray and his staff to anyone that is looking for amazing plastic surgery and staff in the Bay Area.<//review>

I’ve had Botox from Dr Gray since I was 27, and now I’m 31. I get it about every 6 months and it looks flawless every time. I also do my lips every year which looks entirely natural. No one has ever asked me if I get my lips done, I just look better! I travel from LA because that’s how good he is- well worth the trip!<//text>

<Text>I’m extremely happy with my BA result.  All I wanted was natural looking breasts.  I was 34 b deflated before BA.  I’m now 34 c with natural looking breasts.  I had 250cc low profile implants.  I tried on different sizes and picked out what I was most comfortable with.  Of course Dr. Gray adviced what was best for me based on my breast diameter measurement.  Everything  was thoroughly discussed in advance with Dr. Gray.  No surprises, you know exactly the implants you’re getting. My result was amazing!!!! Dr. Gray is the best!!!   Dr. Gray also did BA for my sister and friends many years ago.  Their breasts are still looking amazing today.  The best part is you barely see the scars.</Text><resp>{'time': 1573953011031, 'text': 'Thank you so much for your trust and for sharing your experience.'}<//resp>< userid>

My wife and I are driving hours... passing by hundreds of plastic surgeons... to see Dr.Gray! ...for an updated augmentation after my wife had two beautiful children.

The staff is wonderful, his office is immaculate, and Dr.Gray is only interested in doing... the best! He spent a lot of time with us for our orientation which we appreciated. It’s apparent he is an expert in his field and a genuinely caring doctor.

You get what you pay for. Do it right the first time and call Bay Area Plastic Surgery.< /Text><UserId.>104240433367960304196</UserId.>< username>

<Text>I was referred to doctor Grays office for a  Breast augmentation...From the moment  calling in for the 1st time the staff at Doctor Gray's office made me feel comfortable and at ease, they are all so kind and helpful. I am so incredibly happy with my experience at doctor Gray's office to give him and his staff only 5 stars is an insult he deserves so much more. Doctor Gray answered all my questions about the procedure and walked me through everything he is Informative, experienced and his attention to detail is unmatched. I'm so incredibly happy with my decision. I came all the way from fort bragg, ca 4.5 hrs to see dr. Gray and I will continue to go to him in the future. He is such a talented Dr I felt so safe and listened to. Thank you Dr Gray and staff you are all so amazing!</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

I had an emergency situation and my husband called him on a Saturday evening.  He came to the office to see us that night.  He called his team, Cherisse and anesthesiologist, to be in surgery the next day at 8 am on a Sunday morning.  He does good work!

I had breast augmentation one week ago with Dr. Gray and I am beyond happy with the results! Everyone in the office is so welcoming and kind. Dr. Gray is extremely knowledgeable and made me feel really comfortable with my decision to move forward with surgery. On the day of surgery, the nurse Ashley was so comforting and helpful, she made everything go by really smoothly. I was surprisingly not nervous at all. I could not be happier with my decision!</Review>

Professional, top notch, current, empathetic, and more.
I've been seeing Dr. Grey and his wonderful staff and nurses for years.
Don't go to a Med Spa for filler, see a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon.
Fractional CO2 and his other treatments has kept my skin and face looking many years younger.
Thank You, Dr. Grey.</Review>

I had the most amazing experience with Dr.Gray! I had my surgery 4 years ago and when I first met him, he was super informative and I could tell he had an artistic eye. I scheduled my surgery days after my consult and the whole day was comfortable, I wasnt nervous at all because I knew i was in good hands. Healing was a breeze, I stopped my prescription pain medicine the day after surgery and I had no bruising at all. These days, I follow many surgeons online and ive seen many surgery clips and there is a difference in healing based on how gentle and experienced the surgeon is, and Dr. Gray's expertise shows in the healing process. I wanted a natural look, and he delivered. No one is able to tell Ive had work done :)

His staff was extremely personable and accomodating towards me and they went above and beyond expectations.

5 Stars in every category. My experience was perfect every step of the way.</review>

<Review>I've been a patient of Dr. Gray's for 20 years.  Cherries,   Lalennya and Dr. Gray especially make me feel like I'm an important client with priority as if I saw them daily,  though 2 to 15 years may have passed. I trust my body and life in Dr. Gray's hands. Would never go anywhere else for self-care.</Review></record>

Dr Gray is an amazing plastic surgeon!!!
I’m very happy with my breast augmentation!!! He exceeded my expectations. I had a baby year after my breast augmentation and I was worried my breasts would get ruined after breastfeeding but they stayed exactly same . I would not go to any other surgeon !!!!
He is the best in the country !!!!!! Thank you so much Dr Gray 😊</Text>

I was referred by a friend who went to Dr. Gray for Breast Augmentation and went in for a consult, needless to say I went with him. His staff is friendly and helpful! His RN Cherisse is wonderful! Her  manner makes you feel so comfortable and answers any questions and concerns you might have after surgery. I thought going to San Francisco was far, but I chose to drive that far for the best work. I'm really satisfied and happy with my outcome. Dr. Gray does awesome work.

I had breast augmentation almost 20 yrs ago? I give 5 stars to Dr. Gray, who is an awesome surgeon, you can't even see a scar.
However I gave 4 stars because they got hard which shouldn't have been the case with the textured implants. Also because of their anatomical shape,, they rode up. Which he did say sometimes happens.
So, in hind site.. I wouldn't   have paid the extra thousand for the textured/anatomical.< /text>

<Review>If I could give zero stars I would.  Went in for several appointments, and at every one, I let him know that I was looking for a natural look.  After hours of trying on, I selected Mod+ with 250cc just to bring me from an A to a small C.  After my surgery, I felt like I was huge.  I requested my paperwork, and it was littered with HP (high profile) and 550 cc.  I couldn't believe it.  He denies everything and refused to fix/refund his butchered work.  AVOID LEONARD GREY AT ALL COSTS< /Review></record></dataset><record>

They put in the wrong implants (way bigger than I had asked for) and did not care too much about how I felt about it.  And they were always at least 1-1.5 hours late for each appointment.  They are about the turn and burn way or making money.  Not serviced focused.</text>

< review>
I would be very careful if you are going to get a photo facial treatment.
I went many years ago, the operator of the machine was not trained in the usual way.  I was told by Dr. Gray that she was grandfathered in.  l
that should have raised up the flag,  I had the treatment, I was told it would continue to work for months.  Well it lasted only 2 weeks.  When I went to see Dr. Gray after my procedure to show him that it didn't work.  I was very disappointed.  Especially, when he had assured me that if it didn't work for me that I would get my money back.
Since the tec wasn't educated on what types of skins this method worked on it failed.
If any of you out there are planning on this procedure, make sure you don't have any type of inflamitory problems.
A word to the wise, take your own pictures before and after you have anything done.  Document everything and keep notes week to week and the more pictures you take the better.  That way you have proof, if you aren't happy with what you have had done.</review>

This store is great! They offer great prices and discounts. They even make uniforms for small businesses. I bought 3 jerseys, half off each. I also bought a set of team balls and they gave me a great price. I'm a regular their now. Last time I was there I was given 20% off my entire purchase. They're even involved in their communities</review>

Extremely helpful staff. Helped me with trying on shoes to make sure I got a good fit and feel. Also allowed me to try on some shin guards to make sure they were comfortable. On top of the great customer service, they have a wide variety of soccer goodies. Awesome place.</text>

<Text>BEST SERVICE EVER
I spent about 2 hours there looking for some cleats and I’m not kidding I tried on all the cleats there poor girl has stacks and stacks of shoes but she was so understanding which was great and she even offered to call other locations if they didn’t have what i wanted. Service was so great I went in only wanting to spend $50 on cleats and ended up spending $450 on items. Yesy was the girl that kept up with my subborn a** lol
I recommend everyone to come here!!</Text><user>111942718106917657371< /user>< pictures>

Always a great place to hang out with family and friends. Our kids like going here on their own with friends to have lunch or ride bikes on the trails. Definitely a nice, relatively hidden park for us locals. Dogs are supposed to be on-leash but city animal control has come by much less often during COVID</Review>

It's a really nice little park.  Very accessible to walk from almost any direction in the neighborhood.  The landscape is hilly, but it still has some flat spots if you want to kick a ball around.  It's shrouded in trees giving a bit of privacy.  There's a basketball court and a few picnic tables.  The small playground is setup well.  Drinking fountain to water the dogs.  Only real downside is the lack of bathrooms.< /review>

Great neighborhood park. Wide open spaces for little ones to roam. A playground set in good condition offering lots of different activities for toddlers. A basketball court, small hiking trails, and picnic tables make it easy to spend some time here comfortably.<//review>

<rate>4</rate><Text>Kids love this hilly park with a eucalyptus grove, they hike around and build tepees. Unofficial unfenced dog park, lots of loose happy dogs playing and signs everywhere with the number to report them. Sandy playground has older equipment but is adequate. A few bench tables and grills. No restrooms at all, so this is mostly a park for locals. Big parties tend to rent portapotties or park an RV for party goers to use.< /Text>< Pictures>

Great local park. It's on leash but many dogs run off leash. Which is cool with me but folks don't pick up after their dogs.  So poop bombs all over the grassy field.< /review>

Great neighborhood park with lots of open space and trails. My toddler loves this park, nice jungle gym/play area. It's also an unofficial dog park of sorts - sometimes you see off leash dogs playing catch with their owners. Water fountain, basketball court, small parking lot, picnic tables and a charcoal grill. No bathrooms.</text>

<review>Used to love this park and take our dog here all the time. Great places for kids, dogs and families to play and picnic. But, now quite a few dog owners have turned it into an off leash dog park. The park has signs posted that dogs must be on a leash but no one enforces it. Now dogs run free, poop is not always cleaned up (even though free bags are provided by the park) owners let their dogs run around not always supervised. Hoping the park ranger or someone in charge of the park could start enforcing the rules and give the park back to the entire neighborhood.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x80deaaa1c36ae6ff:0x624b3177e97e96ed<//Gmap_id></record>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Small park, but ok for children. And the dogs. Possibility of a walk to have a beautiful view of the ocean and San Diego. I only go there if I am in the vicinity.

(Original)
Petit parc, mais correct pour les enfants. Et les chiens. Possibilité d’une marche pour avoir une belle vue de l’océan et de San Diego. J’y vais seulement si je suis dans les environs.<//Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMuZGY6wzeUXhC9A1Be3oR0mRFaDYubrx4fzBkZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

This business would have got 4 stars but unfortunately a certain service agent is ready to retire and has a bad attitude .we took our 2016 sentra in for a bad transmission right off the bat he started with  everything we needed done I told him that the transmission needs to be fixed first (under warranty) he calls me back with a 1100.00 dollar oil and break job . Engine light came on girlfriend takes it in he tells her that he does not have time to plug a scanner in to check it . Fortunately the gentleman next to him said he could check it done 5mins tops 👍.</text>

I remember I went here with my grandmother when I was young. This place is really beautiful and amazing.  Everyone was really nice and the food was astounding. I remember as soon as I walked inside I smelled all different kinds of tea. It’s a really nice place. 100% recommend👏< /Text>

Had lunch with friends on Wednesday and one of these is extremely fussy. We all loved it and highly recommend. Our waiter was so fast we could barely ask and he'd already taken care of the request.  Lunch was busy but we were not ignored at all.  I had the fish sandwich and was amazed how good it was. I could barely put it down. I think I ate constantly.  Everyone loved their entree and we will definitely be back.<//review>

<Review>This is a lovely place to enjoy afternoon tea. Once greeted, we were seated inside the quaint house-remodeled restaurant and brought a tray of teas to smell. After selecting our choices (grapefruit oolong and honeybush apricot), our smile-prone waittress brought us cups of soup, momentarily followed by our tea and timely succeeded by a salad topped with fresh fruit. The tea was delicious and the food was a fine counterpart. After a cup's time, our triple-decker snack spread was delivered (see photo) and looked mouthwatering. Our waitress gave us a run down of the culinary selections. The scones were amazing, desserts delectable, and finger sandwiches, surprisingly filling. All an all a marvelous experience with wonderful flavors well worth the $25 per head price. Will be returning.

On the parking note: there is street parking, metered and unmetered (street sweeping Mon 10am-12pm) and there is also a public lot at the corner of the street past High Tea Cottage on the left that $2.50 for the day.</Review>< Time>

<rating>4<//rating><review>Went to get Sunday brunch while out and about. Didn't have a reservation but was able to get in right away. Sat upstairs in their patio area which was very nice, but I imagine gets very warm in the summer. Service was average - main waiter didn't check in often, but a waiter for other tables was happy to help us out. Food too was average overall - potatoes & coffee were delicious, but crispy French toast (I had ordered regular French toast), eggs, sausage, and quiche could be found in any of your typical diner restaurants. Overall I'd eat here again if in the area and there wasn't a wait, but I'd be more interested in trying a different restaurant next time I'm out that direction.< /review>< pics>

Love this place! Delicious scones, a large variety of tea sandwiches and a ton of tea to choose from (they even let you smell the teas to help you choose!). The cottage itself is lovely and if you come with young tea party guests, they get to search the garden for the tea fairy :)</Text>

$60 a head for a three course, small portion, meal that specializes in an ambience made to exploit British enthusiasts rather than tea drinkers. No substitutions, though they will accommodate dietary restrictions. The teas are mostly herbal, very sweet, and limited to a selection of twenty or so. All teas are brewed with the same temperature and thrown in a pot, so expect a tanen heavy experience that becomes more bitter as you drink. All in all this place is good for a special occasion after lunch for people who want to feel like sophisticated tea drinkers, but don't actually drink a lot of tea.<//text>

<review>I am really surprised by the number of bad experiences shared by some of the reviewers.  We've been going to High Tea Cottage for years and never had a bad experience.  Jenn has always been gracious, hospitable, and has gone out of her way to take care of us like royalty.  I'm sad that others have not had this kind of experience.  I believe it's the exception and not the norm what they've experienced.< /review>< response>

Step back in time. Be prepared to be dazzled. What a wonderful place. The cottage is exquisite, music wonderful, service exceptional and the food out of this world. Jenn has created a unique place to relax and experience tea and its traditions.
I loved it. We are returning customers. Today we had the holiday tea celebration which was 5 courses

Everything was absolutely stellar, and my friend and I had a lovely time and left very full. Frankly, I was a bit trepidatious because of some of the poor reviews, but I can only guess that these must have been written by patrons who were not familiar with the experience of High Tea. Of course the management's insistence on both reservations and timeliness are necessary in a such a very small venue. The place is simply too small to accommodate drop-ins without a reservation. The owner was warm and gracious, the staff was attentive, and the food was well prepared, traditional high tea fair. If you are expecting huge deli sandwiches, High Tea is not for you. Scones with jam & clotted cream, and petite crust-less finger sandwiches are to be expected. If you have a larger appetite, additional soups and salads can be added for a fee. But if you want to stuff yourself... go to a burger place instead. You are paying for a relaxed and elegant experience...the same way you pay a lot more for coffee at Starbucks than at 7-11. I saw no evidence of any discriminatory behavior, as complained about by another reviewer. A group of very young girls sat next to us - white, Latina & African American - and the owner patiently answered all of their many questions about how it worked, prices for each item, etc. even though the teens clearly were not intending to spend much money, and were completely clueless about the ritual of Tea. My friend and I had a lovely experience and I am looking forward to returning with my elderly Mom soon!</Text>

I took my 6 year old granddaughter for her first high tea. The service was wonderful as was the food. They even gave my granddaughter a tour of the place to look for the tea fairy and when she returned she found a bracelet under her napkin left by the fairy. We had a delightful afternoon.</text>

The service was slow and but the woman who served us was nice. The food was ok and the tea was hot and delicious. The place itself is small and a bit cramped but still doable (unless you're claustrophobic). Do beware: they tack on the gratituity to your bill! The service we received was NOT worth $9! I would have left $3 at the most. We plan on going back, but only for specials. The regular price is too steep for the service and what's served.<//review>< time>

< Review>
It was the worst experience I ever had. It took them 1 hour 1/2 to serve cold sandwiches and deserts. They just gave us tea, jam and cream with no bread or scones. My poor son paid $420 for 5 people for low quality food and poor service.<//Review>

<date>1517516809803</date><rate>1</rate><Review>My friend and I went for High Tea. My friend was parking her car. I was seated at a table and this woman came over and started removing the place settings and moving the table.  She did not say she was the owner, she did not say excuse me,  she did not say "Sorry, I need to get a person in a wheel chair inside and need to move you for a moment." When I asked, what was going on, she became unhinged, started yelling at me.  She told me I was rude and insulting, that she could do what she wanted in her establishment.  I said I was sorry, I did not know what was happening.  She then refused us service, threaten to call the police if I did not leave, her husband got into the act as well.  By this time, my friend had come to where I was and stood there in tears.  We left.  I WILL NEVER RETURN, NOR RECOMMEND THIS PLACE.  My sister has been the head hostess in a restaurant for 24 years and was appalled when I told her what happened.  No restaurant should treat their patrons in this fashion.  Do not take the chance of having a bad experience here.</Review>< pics>

Not that impressed. We had a discount coupons, which helped. Over priced and we saw a cockroach crawl out from the chair rail and the waitress said it was from the fresh flowers that were just delivered.< /Text>

Always a lovely experience. But last time they included gratuity in the check and forgot to tell us. The owner was too busy cracking jokes and apologizing for the delay.</text>

<Review>Server was nice, tea and food good, owner blatantly rude!!  Have never had an experience with a business owner that was so disrespectful.  Made reservations 4 weeks ahead of time (for when family was together for holidays) without any issue, we thought, then called to confirm day prior and was told reservations were never recorded, but they would try to work us in.  We were then seated in totally separate rooms from the rest of our party. Ok, fine, annoying as there were many open tables for most of the time we were there, but we went with it.  Then owners proceeded to come to our table twice and essentially say we were lying about making reservations, in front of other patrons.  Will never return as long as they own it.  Sad as the rest of the experience would have been fun for my 4 yr old.  Even she was uncomfortable.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Gmap_id>

Worst experience I've Ever Had! I was looking for a cozy restaurant to relax and enjoy an evening out with my daughter but it turned out to be a Horrible Experience. Jenn, who is the manager, was disgustingly rude to our server who made a simple mistake. I felt so bad for this waitress. She explained that she was new and I know it was just a simple mistake but this Jenn woman called her names and almost made the poor girl cry!! I couldn't believe it!! If you're looking for a relaxing place to enjoy your time, Don't Come Here!< /Text>

I walked in to inquire about the tea room and I was spoken to in the most condescending mannor I have ever experienced. The women here are rude, ignorant, and unless you're wearing a hat and tie, DO NOT expect to be treated well. DO NOT BOTHER UNLESS YOU'RE "DRESSED THE PART"<//review>

<Name>A Faustina</Name><Review>How dare you speak to me the way you did and in front of my daughter, her guests and family!! There is a professional way to do business and there is the way YOU chose to do business!

Such a shame, and in front of so many! Had you chosen to take the high road and admit you made the mistake of never checking your reservation book, never sending us our invoice as promised when we booked, never confirming a count and if you were unsure, why not ​pick up the phone or type on the computer to confirm. That is NOT your clients job!!  Had you looked, you would have seen we even gave you a deposit of $100!  I even emailed you that I was going to bring my own favors instead of the teddy bears you had suggested. You replied back that it was no problem​ early on in the process​. Look, we paid you a deposit to have a party and you clearly screwed up royally!    The only one civil and worthy of respect is your manager. You however were simply ridiculous! ! Never in all my life have I witnessed such bizarre behavior.  And to my face you lied and told me, out of your embarrassment that you've never seen me before, ever​! ​Simply horrifying , as if I just showed up off the street after sitting in your tea house for over an hour choosing sandwiches, teas, etc,...you had our money too!! Haven't you ever heard the saying "the customer is always right!!"?
You are ridiculous and all of your negativity will come back to bite you on your tea cozy.
Cheers indeed!</Review>< user>

Genuine Antique China, extensive selection of teas including rooibos blends, scrumptious snacks, various themed rooms and tableside service of Devonshire Cream, jams and citrus curd are why the High Tea Cottage gets a thumbs-up from me.</text>

< Review>
We wanted to take our Mom to tea for her birthday and decided to try this place. What a HUGE mistake. Walked in the door and were greeted (if that's what you want to call it) by the rudest most pathetic excuse for a human being I have ever had the displeasure of meeting in my life. She asked if we had reservations and I replied no, but that I had tried calling several times to try to make one and I got an answering machine each time. I did not know that you should leave a message if you wanted to even enter the door to this place. She VERY rudely informed me that they were closed on Tuesdays, I have no idea why she felt she needed to tell me this as it was Wednesday, but whatever. She then abruptly walked away and went into the tea room. We stood there in shock and waited for her to come back thinking she was checking to see where she could seat us. By the way there was not a soul in the place. She came back and walked right by us without a word and went straight into the kitchen. I told my sister and my Mom, "she has one minute to come back out here or we leave". She didn't and we left. I was dumbfounded, not to mention angry. Who does this woman think she is? How dare her talk to us and treat us that way. So I called to speak to a manager and register a complaint and to my surprise a man with an english accent answered (not the answering machine) and I proceeded to tell him of our experience and he had the audacity to defend the woman! Unbelievable! Then he told me that he saw my Mom, sister and I walk through the tea room, which we did not and for that matter what difference would that have made anyway? I told him we absolutely did not do that and he had the nerve to say that he would swear in a court of law that he saw us do this! Not only are they rude they are also liars. Can you believe these people? Why are they still in business? I urge anyone even thinking of trying this place, DO NOT! These people do not deserve your patronage, nor your hard earned money. And it's not cheap. I know tea rooms are a little pricey, I have been to many all over this country, but this one is way overpriced, considering the people that run it are RUDE, RUDE, and RUDE. I wish there was a lower rating, because they don't even deserve the Poor-Fair one I had to give. Take my advice DO NOT go here. There are plenty of other tea rooms around that know how to treat customers and that know the meaning of tea. It's about a quaint little tea house, delicate little sandwiches, delectable little pastries, fresh warm scones and a nice pot of tea. Relaxing and pleasurable. Not some little hovel with Cruella de Ville running the place.</Review>

<text>The worst place you could ever go to. Extremely overpriced, terrible service, and the owner is absolutely awful. We told her we had a Groupon but because we didn't tell her waiter  (who didn't speak good English) at the very beginning she yelled at us and was extremely rude. Avoid avoid most terrible place you have a go-to.</text>< rating>

Kenneth from Motor City Lexus of Bakersfield provided so much help throughout the whole process of purchasing my newest vehicle! Such an easy process as well. Not to mention they had great customer service! I look forward in purchasing vehicles from them in the near future. Make sure you ask for Kenneth when you want to purchase a vehicle.< /Review>

Thank you Fernando and Jake for getting my husband in his dream car. He’s still can’t believe it.  My car is amazing too. I have always owned a Lexus since my late 20’s and will continue ‘til I die. Most trusted vehicle with best luxury feel and comfort. Such style, class and beauty. What helps me make decisions is having good people working with me as well. Not every dealership can provide that. You guys did. It’s always nice to have good, honest people to help in that transition. You gave us what we wanted and asked for. THANK YOU! Looking forward to our next purchase with you all. Easy in and out. Btw, Bakersfield Lexus IS a very nice dealership. Updated technology was impressive as well.< /Text>

<review>I have been to over a dozen dealerships throughout my life and this is by far the best dealership I stepped foot into. I was greeted the second I got out of my car and was able to test drive within minutes. The salesmen Fernando was incredibly helpful and an amazing guy. Also shout out to Ali the general manager he’s a great man too! Their reviews truly reflect their performances and professionalism.< /review></record>

I went in a walked out with a new car. The experience was very fast and easy going. Vanessa was so great I’ve never had a woman salesperson and when I say I told her what I could afford she made sure I got what I wanted and everyone I came across was very pleasant. I really recommend Lexus and I’ll be back in the near future!<//review>

<Review>I normally do not purchase my vehicles in Bakersfield because I've not had much success in dealing with sales people that actually wanted to make a sale. However, I decided to try again with Motor City Lexus and what a difference! Fernando Villagomez and the rest of the staff made the experience a pleasant one. He is friendly, professional and clearly wanted our business. I was impressed with the high quality of their inventory even for used vehicles. Thanks so much for turning what is usually a dreadful experience into a much a better one. I highly recommend this dealership and ask for Fernando.</Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>{'time': 1616522875314, 'text': 'Rahab - Thank you for taking the time to review us!

<Review>Every visit is great. My wife recently leased the Gx460.
Fernando is our guy. He helped us with now two Lexus vehicles. Never had any question left unanswered. Lexus of Bakersfield has been helpful and attentive to our needs in a particular vehicle and what our budget dictates. We love the Lexus family and we’re happy to be a part of the Lexus family! We like to thank Lance our finance guy and we like to thank Mr. Castillo, sales manager, for all the hard work they do.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

I went to Motor City Lexus of Bakersfield to test drive a car I subsequently purchased. I was prepared for, ya know, the pesky, intrusive, obnoxious car dealer we all brace ourselves for... SO NOT TRUE HERE!!! Vanessa Bustamante was my salesperson and it was actually a really great experience! She was knowledgeable snd informative.. as opposed to being a ‘know it all’. She was helpful and supportive.. as opposed to pushy and leading. I know, that for any of my future car purchases, I will go there first and I highly recommend a person in the market for a car check them out as well!! WOW.. who would have thought it would actually be a really pleasant experience! I’m so pleased!!  Thank you Vanessa!! I love my new car!!</Text>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Review>My son could not find the right color RX450 in the bay area and I found one on this dealer. Since my daughter is buying us one for Christmas and they also have the one I like, I talked to Julio and fixed an appointment to see/buy the cars before 11 am the next day. My son drove almost 200 miles that night to my place for the 11:00 am appointment and around 9 am we are getting ready to drive another hour and a half to this dealer. Julio called to tell us that one of the cars we want was gone! He knew how far these people are driving to buy this car but that did not stop them from selling the car after we talked. Beware of this dealership when they make a promise.< /Review>< Pictures>

My guy, Julio, was certain that the two cars we were looking for were indeed in stock and ready to go. Being from the Bay Area, we figured it'd be worth the trek if the price was right - which seemed to be the case based on the online pricing.

However, once at our pit stop in a nearby town, we awoke to one of the two cars no longer available! Needless to say, Julio done goofed. So here we are, already 3/4 of the way to the dealer, realizing one of the cars we wanted is no longer there. Numbers were presented by Julio which ultimately didn't equate to what we felt was fair: the price of inconvenience.

Julio didn't attempt to keep us around for very long and almost immediately let us go. Heck of a feeling when you are told that some cars will be held for you, you make the effort to drive all the way down, only to be told "SIKE! Would you care for a silver one? Same price though"< /Review>< Time>

I purchased a Lexus which had been a lease return from my son. Issa handled every detail.  Since I live 600 miles from the dealership, I relied on Issa for every step.  It was actually easier than any other buying experience I’ve ever had.  And I have purchased many autos.  The SUV was delivered to my home in Oregon as promised and I would not hesitate to do another transaction in the future with Issa and Motor City. 5 stars<//Text>

<review>There was nothing more that could have made our buying experience more wonderful than it was! John Reed was absolutely phenomenal! We actually only went to get our oil changed and ended up buying not one, but two vehicles from him! He was honest, upfront, extremely personable and not pushy...which we appreciated!!  John made the buying experience comfortable and actually fun even in this crazy pandemic environment we are currently in. John has us as customers for life and will be recommending him to both friends and family. He has not only became our go to sales guy, but our now our friend! When our lease is up, we will reaching out to John to help us with our next Lexus lease.

I just wanted to share my great experience buying a car from this store. I personally work in the car business myself and I've never witnessed the level of customer service from any car dealer.
FERNANDO VILLAGOMEZ was my salesman and he provided the highest level of service possible.

The car was for my brother in San Jose. None of us step foot in the foot and still in the smoothest transaction.  They gave us a great price upfront and had the car delivered ahead of schedule.  Marcela Torres in finance was as professional as they come. She explained all the options available to protect the vehicle and the paperwork was perfect.

I highly recommend this store and will be referring anyone I know that is looking for a car to
FERNANDO VILLAGOMEZ.  Don't be afraid to shop out of your area for the best service and value. This was truly an unforgettable experience. Thank you MCL.< /review>

Just bought our second Lexus at Motor City Lexus! The sales people there are amazing. We asked for Jim Ballard since he’s the one who sold us our first car.  He is an excellent sales man. Very friendly & knowledgeable. If you’re ever in the need for a new car, ask for Jim. You will not be disappointed! Everything went smooth, to the test drives & all the way to signing the papers. They were all so nice & made us feel comfortable with the process.</review>

This review is for the service department of Lexus. All customers should triple check their cars and make sure it matches up with the service report. I can't count how many times I've had my Lexus serviced here and the report says something is done when it actually was never done (tire pressure) (floor mats secured) (fluids, windshield cleaner). I don't know why this is such an issue with the service department or why they can't simply do honest work 🙄 but it doesn't make me trust them with servicing my vehicle, especially with this last visit, we noticed our tire pressure was not checked or corrected properly and come to find out we had a nail in our tire and could have gotten into a serious accident if we hadn't come back to confront the issue. They are fixing the issue now.<//Review>

I have a non Lexus vehicle that was purchased there with a warranty. They didn't treat me different from any normal Lexus owner. They were prompt and courteous and Curtis was excellent with me. Car was done when promised and washed. Customer lounge is really nice too. Thank you very much for everything.</text>

<Review>Couldn’t have been happier with the service at Motor City Lexus. Everyone there is as polite as they can be and they go out of the way to take care of your needs. Even the loaner was top-notch; much nicer than the car I left to be repaired. Work was done quickly and correctly.

<Review>Do NOT buy a Lexus from this dealership!! The staff here is dishonest and awful to deal with!  They have good prices because they are selling damaged cars that have hidden problems.  They sold me a car that only has 10k miles on it and is a year old, but has a whole slew of issues that they did not disclose prior to purchasing. It is going to cost over $4000 to have all the problems fixed. Now that I’m trying to get the problems rectified they aren’t returning my calls as promised, and acknowledged they knew the car wasn’t in great shape as previously stated.  This is the worst car buying experience I’ve ever had!!  Take your business elsewhere if you want a car that doesn’t have issues. The Lexus certification at this dealership means nothing. Lexus of Bakersfield will go to any cost to sell a car including being dishonest about the integrity of the L-Lexus certified cars they are selling. Please shop around and know Lexus of Bakersfield is able to offer the best price because you are not getting the same quality of car that you would get at another Lexus dealership.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80ea6a9868f999ff:0x5815f25a041f5ef2< /Gmap_id></record>

Recently bought a car here not even 30 days in and I already have a problem I believe I’m not the first one to say that they sell you a car with hidden damages. Since now that I have this car I have been looking at their ratings and they say the same thing. Don’t ever buy a Lexus here my insurance said they have never seen a problem like this before.< /Review>

<Text>I had the best experience with this dealership, I went last week not to buy a vehicle but to sell one. I met Julio Velasquez the first day, he was very honest, humble and very PROFESSIONAL Julio gave me the confidence that I was looking for on a vehicle adviser.
I went back yesterday Julio pointed to the right vehicle. He explained to me by detail all my numbers, he did it on a easy way that I was able to understand at the first time.

Then I met the other IMPORTANT PERSON; Marcela Torres (Financing Department), she was so PROFESSIONAL and had an easy way to go thru the financing contract, she has this innovation equipment that its easy to understand those numbers, I really felt like I was dealing with people that really care about me and my needs

I will deferentially recommend this dealership to anyone who is looking for honestly and quality

God Bless you all and Thank you Lexus for Having People like them working for you.....

Sincerely,

Issa and Ali, took extra time to find a car that matched my specific needs is a commuter. I feel like they looked at not only my safety but also longevity of a vehicle as it applied to me. Me and my family felt very welcome and it was a very comfortable non pressured experience. They have earned our family's future business for sure.<//text>

She gives fair deals, and is beyond knowledgeable with the legal process because I had particular circumstances (trust me I’ve spent hours on the phone with her). Her customer service is second to none, and did I mention she is fair with the prices? She made this whole process of buying from a dealer SO much more enjoyable. Above and beyond and could not be happier. As much as this sounds like some fake review, it’s not, this was my first dealership experience and she was MORE than fair. And I was HAPPY to do business by the time I walked out of there, keys in hand. I liked her enough to spend time writing this review, which I have never done for another business.

I recently purchased my first Lexus, and was blown-away by the amazing customer service I received and the way I was treated from the moment I stepped onto the lot until I drove away in my new Lexus IS 300 Sport!

All of my questions were answered, I never felt rushed or pressured, and it was obvious that the employees are *genuinely*  concerned with the customer as a person and not just interested in selling a car.

Ali (GM), Marcella (Finance), and Dakotah deserve personal recognition for going above-and-beyond to make my car-buying experience one I will not soon forget!

I'm of course in love with my new car, but also enamored and impressed with the superior service offered at Motor City Lexus!< /review>

Service was done, my service advisor angel was great and was out to lunch when I arrived to pick up my car.  I have a question with service work, the service advisor manager didn’t help me, he just sit on his desk, Michael service tech lead come out and explaining things, he was very helpful, explain everything about what was done and why it wasn’t completely mark correctly. What I found out is that service tech work by the car complete the faster you fix it, the more money he makes. There’s no more take your time make sure it’s done right, I have to bring back my car to rotate the tires cause I don’t think it was done< /text>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>Good Evening,

This is pertaining to especially Rick Perez, because I had spoke with him months prior, but was not really interested in the Buick car.

However, I always had much respect at his approach to his way of sales. He is stellar, honest, and I waited although continued my search for a automobile, but held out over many variables at other dealerships that in my opinion were unsavory.

Furthermore, I am no expert in the car business at all. I have worked in a very high standard restaurant/hotel on the coast for ten years called The Cliffs Resort. I must say that your people carry themselves with the same dignity and respect. I know that I purchased a great used Jeep for the price. I looked everywhere, and no one has better integrity, morals, values than your dealership.

Moreover, I am thankful and grateful to you. Much appreciated for the time to get my other car home, the inspection, lower financing than my own bank. Your parts department  told me of extra things done too. I hope this covers everything.

Sincerely,

Always a great experience when I’ve come to service my vehicle. They let you use another car for the day so you don’t need to wait or take a shuttle. It’s so convenient. The staff are always friendly and helpful. I also enjoy the complementary coffee and snacks!<//Review>

This is by far the best dealer we’ve dealt with due to their smooth transaction process and professional environment. Customer satisfaction is their priority that they even offered us to bring the car home before buying it. The sales people who took care of us are Jay Singh and John Reed. I’ll definitely come back for my next car purchase.<//Text>

He was willing to show us every aspect of the car we were considering, even moving 2 cars from the showroom floor outside so we could see the colors in sunlight.  Jim allowed us to test drive as many vehicles as we asked. I've purchased numerous new vehicles from dealerships, Jim made my purchase go smoother than I have ever experienced and absolutely made my day.!

<text>Pretty good experience. Not completely happy with their lack of willingness to work lower on the price. But in that respect, all dealerships are the same! Customers are always with out a doudt second, when it comes to the pricing the the car. Anyhow, the process was easy and the people were nice. So far, no problems with he used car I purchased. Hope that continues to stay that way. So in conclusion, had they worked harder to give the price I'd asked for they'd be getting 5stars instead it is 4.</text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80ea6a9868f999ff:0x5815f25a041f5ef2< /Gmap_id></record>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>I took my Lexus IS 250 F sport into Motor City Lexus of Bakersfield to have my 60k mile service and couldn't be happier with the service I received. I was advised by my service consultant Angel Del Rio that I needed new tires and he ensured I got the best deal and even helped me pick out new tires. I was hesitant spending so much money on my service but I'm so glad I did because my car is running like just like when I first bought it. Thank you Angel, front desk ladies who helped me get a loaner car & provided exceptional customer service, and everyone else at Motor City Lexus of Bakersfield as the service I received was excellent. I will continue to be back as a customer because you all continue to get it right every time! If you own a Lexus and are hesitant about getting service done due to cost understand that is completely normal- but part of owning a luxury car is maintaining it and you will be able to maintain your car condition if you take it to Motor City Lexus of Bakersfield or any Lexus dealership.< /Review>< Pictures>

Walking into Motor City Lexus for the first time was by far the best experience I have ever had leasing my first vehicle. From the moment being greeted by the receptionist to meeting our car salesman, Rocky. He definitely gave us a peace of mind throughout our whole experience. I was recommended to go to Rocky and he definitely lived up to the expectations. And so now I can say the same when being asked about my Lexus. Thank you so much Motor City Lexus for a wonderful experience. The customer service was outstanding and I'll definitely continue to do business with Motor City Lexus!<//review>

<review>My salesman was Jeremy Beck, and he was excellent. He was friendly and helpful, answered all my questions completely, and followed me throughout the whole process of leasing my new Envision. I have purchased a number of vehicles at Motor City, and I have always found the people and the process excellent to the highest degree. Both Chris Arias and Johnnie Martinez have helped me in the past and were both excellent. In addition I have found the Buick maintenance people superior to those in other auto dealerships. Overall, Motor City Buick rates more than the five stars I have given.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<review>We recently went to trade in our Lexus that we bought at Motor City Lexus and found out on Carfax that there was an accident when Motor City owned it. At the time when we were purchasing the car from MCL this accident did not post on the Carfax report considering it was only 11 months old.The accident happened 5 months prior to us purchasing it. Motor City Lexus owned the vehicle and definitely knew about this but never disclosed this to us. As a result, the cars value has taken a drop in regards to resale/trade in value despite the fact that it is excellent condition and low mileage. Worse yet the Carfax reports states that during the accident the airbags failed to deploy.

Bottom line is Motor City Lexus management are completely dishonest people.</review>< pictures>

Mo Omar was very professional, courteous and helpful.  He tried to help me get the best deal he could and when he could not do any more he told me so.  I knew it was the lowest price he could offer based on responses from other dealers.  I will give him 5 star.  The staff at Motor City was very helpful also.<//Text>

Motor City Lexus has the best customer service of any dealership I've ever seen. We bought our Lexus used from Motor City 10 years ago and they had done all the service before we bought it, so we continued to go see them. Our service writer Bruce Weihe has been nothing short of fantastic. Always friendly and professional. He recommends what we need and always tells us what is needed and what is optional but recommended. He always has the answers for our questions honestly. The mechanics are excellent, always doing the job right the first time, never "patching" things together. Will continue to trust Bruce as long as we have a Lexus.<//Text>

<user>104446408335612364432<//user><review>Exceptional service and professionalism. The experience of going to a dealership could be excruciating but that is not the case at Motor City Lexus of Bakersfield. Ali and Faraz are from this point forward my go to guys when it comes to buying a vehicle- new or used. They made the experience hassle free. Just like my mechanic, my mattress guy, my handyman it's hard to find people you trust- I trust Ali & Faraz. I shopped around, did my research and they came through with the vehicle I wanted at the price that beat the competitors. They were knowledgeable and took the time to answer all my questions. I drove off knowing that I would be back with family members who are looking for the kind of service these two men provide. At the end of the day Ali was referred to me by a co-worker. Turns out his reputation is impeccable. Over 400 deals with our agency! All repeat customers. Thank You for your assistance in purchasing a quality vehicle.</review><Time>1544071504299< /Time><Resp>None</Resp><name>Ri Baeza</name>< Pictures>

Service and sales at Motor City Lexus has always been professional, friendly and efficient.  Everyone I have had contact with at the dealership is an outstanding representative of the Lexus brand.  In fact, that is the reason I choose to drive a Lexus and do business with Motor City.  One standout is Angel Del Rio, our Service Consultant for our last few visits.  He has always gone above and beyond the call of duty to help us even when we had an emergency.  Thank You!!< /Review>

<Review>My experience leasing my new car at Motor City Lexus was by far the most professional and customer focused experience ever – and I’ve leased and purchased cars for many years from many high-end brands. From the greeting to drive off, I experienced professional, knowledgeable and service-centric engagements with all staff. The experience was all about me as it should be, but most often is not; what car and terms that I wanted and how to make it happen. Mo Omar took exceptional care of me throughout the process and his follow-up confirms that the long term relationship with Motor City Lexus is as important as the sale.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

After 50 years of buying cars this was the most convenient, non pushy, professional service we have ever received.  Omar as exceptional in his knowledge, attitude and personal attention to our requests and the details.  The entire process from looking at the first truck to the financing, everyone was not only friendly and caring but went out of their way to offer congratulations and well wishes.   A truly incredible experience and we would HIGHLY RECOMMEND  Motor city to everyone interested in a great selection and truck/car buying experience.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

By far the best car buying experience I've ever had. Every single employee at the dealership was nothing but friendly and respectful. James and Franz took excellent care of me by making sure I drove away with exactly what I wanted and went out of their way to make the experience as easy as possible. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend anyone to this team to purchase their next vehicle.<//review>

<review>Mark was an exceptional salesman! We came in with the idea of "weighing our options" about purchasing a new vehicle and Mark went above and beyond, by putting our minds at ease and making us feel comfortable and welcome to just talk.  He provided us with all the information needed to make our final decision and came through for us with the help of Oscar Salazar. It was a great experience and we look forward to purchasing future vehicles with Motor City!</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

< review>
I brought in a vehicle in that we had purchased from the Lexus used car dealership (and had purchased a Lexus extended warranty for). I was on time for my appointment, which was for a 5,000 mile service and check engine light. By three in the afternoon I hadn't heard anything, so I called and was told it was unlikely that my car would even be looked at today. I picked up my car and will find somewhere else to get the repairs completed. They did not charge me anything, but I felt like that was a lot of time wasted.</review>

<Text>The Lexus organization takes care of your needs. Drop to take a look at their best deals on their vehicles. Salesman Issa took care of us and may i say was one of the best experiences i had buying a vehicle. They will work with you and they'll also be reasonable with you. If your indecisive, just be sure to eat something before you go shop. That'll help more with your experience, but if you do not eat, they'll take care of you with some snacks. Get a Lexus.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

I first met Mo on the phone, as I made a cold call looking for a used Hybrid  Lexus. I was impressed with not only his knowledge, but his  warmth and sincerity. We met at the dealership a few days later and I must say the experience far exceeded my expectations. The dealership was all class with first class snacks, coffee, etc. Also, a very cool environment on a very hot day. Mo led us through all of the ins and outs of the whole deal. carefully explaining the parameters of the vehicle itself, while making the buying experience quite painless. I would look forward to dealing with Mo and Motor City Lexus many times in the future.<//review>

<Text>Doing our regular service is a pleasure.  Getting into your vehicle to shop around at "oil and Lube" shops around town...hoping you could trust the shop to do what they advertise was a daunting task...not at our Lexus dealer...our service agent Juanita makes everything clear with a list of checked services they complete.  No doubts about the what services are rendered here. ..< /Text></record>

I appreciate the personalized attention and staying way beyond the closing time to complete my transaction.

I liked that Motor City Lexus would supplement my contract miles with additional 2500 miles at no extra charge.

The only thing missing is free regular services for the life of the lease!< /text>

<Name>Laura Sabedra</Name><review>The Lexus experience is fantastic. Our sales associate, Peter De Keles, was extremely knowledgeable and explained everything in detail! There is no "hard sale" pressure like other dealerships. He gave us a great deal with extras - no need for negotiating. Everyone is so nice and they even give you snacks! We went to other high-end dealerships and did not receive nearly the customer service we received at Motor City. We love our car and  being in the Lexus family. I highly recommend you see Peter at Motor City Lexus  if you are thinking of  purchasing or leasing a new car. Be sure to go there first before you go anywhere else. I guarantee when you finish looking at other vehicles, you'll drive away in a Lexus.<//review><user>104603054438439367784< /user>< Pics>

As a first time buyer, I felt that Issa gave me a great customer service with much professionalism. It was a really great experience buying my car with him. Not only I was able to find what I was looking for, but I also got a great deal. I loved the service and I will refer him to anyone I know that is interested in buying a car.

I'm very satisfied with the service...  👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻<//text>

<Text>I have been using this dealership service department for the past 12 years! Why? Well because they are the best, they are organized, clean, and know who I am when I walk through the doors. I’m also given a new car to drive while they work on my car. My car was 11 years old and they still treated me like I bought the car yesterday. Last week I purchased my second car from this dealership, and did so because I know should I have any issues att all the service department will be there to support me and there will be zero hassles.  If you own a car and don’t want drama with repairs this is the service department for you you.<//Text><userid>107580241027035856894<//userid>< response>

Our shopping experience with Steve Floyd at Motor City was the easiest , less stressful experience my husband and I have ever had . Who would have thought we would lease a vehicle online ?! In our 37 years of married life we have leased one other vehicle and purchased 8 other vehicles brand new . The process ,as I remember it , was very lengthy -- more of an ordeal . We did not experience any of that with Steve Floyd and Motor City . Because of certain circumstances and time constraints , we gave a lot of our info over the phone and using e-mail . And so when we finally sat down , the process took an hour and a half -- versus 5 hours -- or thereabouts ! We totally appreciated that !! --- And the perks with the lease deal that we got is simply amazing  ! The little sticker on our new Terrain's window allows us to receive free ding and window pits, etc. repair -- allows us to be able to store our vehicle onsite , safely , should we be traveling , 2 free car washes per month --- 2 free oil changes . Don't want to brag --- but , we are still so amazed ! Thank you Steve Floyd -- Thank you Motor City !! We are enjoying our vehicle , see you soon !< /review>

Best car buying experience that we have ever had. I recommend this dealership to our family members or anyone looking for a new vehicle. Every employee that assisted us made us feel like we mattered. So grateful to have been referred by a good friend of ours.<//text>

I made an unexpected stop at Motor City Lexus of Bakersfield. It was the last straw for me. I had lost my house and the Camp Fire and now my older Lexus was acting up as I traveled to my family for Christmas. I began to cry. I could hardly get the words out but everyone there took me under their wing and cared for me as if I were part of their family. I had no appointment but they got my car in and fixed. I highly recommend this service department for the care and concern they showed me as well as the excellent mechanics who fixed my car.< /Text>

Our experience was world-class from the first greeting through to delivery!  We could not be more pleased with the customer service and feel that we are blessed to be a Motor City customer.  The service did not stop when we drove off the lot but will be appreciated for the life of our vehicle.<//Text>

This time he took our (blank) and put us back in a Lexus. Thank You  Jim. Both times we dealt with him it was an easy, no pressure experience. Jim knows his product and worked hard to get us the best deal he could. We just hope he remains at Motor City Lexus so when we are ready for a new one, we will know to ask for.

Carlos Arevalo was a great salesman: no pressure, very helpful and knowledgeable.  He was patient with us as caution buyers, answered our questions and never once pressured us into making our final decision.  He was very knowledgeable about the vehicle we were looking at, presented other purchase options available, didn't offer unsolicited advice, and was attentive through the entire process-even the lengthy paperwork process.  We made several trips to the dealership before we made our purchase and Carlos remembered our purchase goals each time he worked with us.  He was definitely a salesman we enjoyed dealing with a would recommend him to others.< /text>

This was our first experience with Motor City Lexus and it was one of  the best experiences we have ever had at a car dealership.  Our salesman Chris Scott was patient, courteous and friendly, never pushy. Once we were sent into the finance department we found that to also be a good experience, again explaining everything to us all the way thru.  We highly recommend Motor City Lexus they go above and beyond. Thanks guys for the experience.< /review>

Danny Smart made this buying experience sensational!  We told him exactly what we wanted in a truck and he went to work getting us exactly what we wanted and more!  He was super fun to work with and made the whole deal happen so FAST!  To boot....he delivered our new truck to our work and we didn't have to take time off to go finish business....and he drove our trade in back to GMC!  Awesome customer service!!!!!<//Text>

They were very accommodating when I called in to have my RX do a recall service. Flexible when I wasnt able to return the rental on the same day as long as I return it before 8am which was OK with me. I reccomend to have their Lexus serviced by this location. I’m surely will come back for future services done to my RX.< /review>

I feel like I've experienced the worst of the worse during my entire car-buying experience. I hated looking for a car until I met Ali and Rocky at Motor City Lexus of Bakersfield. I am a female and a first-time buyer, who shopped alone so you could imagine what kind of sharks other salesmen were, but, not Ali and Rocky. They made sure I felt comfortable, answered any questions I had, allowed me to comfortably test drive a car I wanted, and weren't pushy about having to buy then and there. The best part about my experience was that when I was ready to buy, they made sure it was quick and easy. I am definitely recommending them to all of my friends! They are good people who genuinely look out for their clients' best interest. I am so lucky to have met these guys!<//text>

Motor City Lexus of Bakersfield is awesome! Ali, Faraz, and everyone else is always friendly and welcoming, and I leave knowing that I got the best deal available. This is my 2nd Lexus from MCL, 3rd overall transaction, and my seventh Lexus overall, and all I can say is that I wish I had found this place sooner.

I live in Long Beach, and the drive is roughly two hours, but always totally worth it! These guys forever have my business and my loyalty. Thanks again!!!</review>

Excellent experience,  Christian Patrick Sales was very patient and Knowledgeable of my Denali 1500 that i purchased.  He went over every question i had and also help me set up everything to my personal phone and liking.  Singing Documents was very quick and i was able to experience their new DocuSign where you sign on a huge desk tablet.  Helps make the procedure go by faster.< /review>

The sales person was very knowledgeable and gave me plenty of time to think about my choice.  I test drove two vehicles, and Neil was able to tell me about each vehicle, he also let me test drive both and he just was very patient with me as I made my decision. He help set up my bluetooth and showed me the service areas.  I'm very happy with my purchase. Thank you Neil, and Motor City.< /text>

Leaving Las Vegas to San Francisco a little fly seemed to bother my passengers to the point of panic.  The window jammed, but we were able to get it up.  In Bakersfield, my daughter's little toes "accidentally" opened the window and we couldn't get it back up.  Talk about customer service!  Half an hour after the mechanics usually leave, the team (Aris,  Juanita, Janet and Mike) mobilized to get the window up so we could continue our journey safely with 3 children in 110 degree heat.  Thank you Motor City Lexus for your amazingly kind people!< /text>

Our recent purchase of Lexus RX 350 was probably the best car purchase we have had in our lifetime. Demian Castillo was our salesman and we can't say enough good about him. He made our buying experience a true pleasure. We hope he goes far with your company.  Richard was also a great help.  Chad from technical product was also wonderful.
Thanks again for the experience, we are enjoying our car.

Sincerely,

Demian Castillo  was incredibly knowledgeable and accommodating. My husband and I asked him to research various color interior/exterior color combinations and he surely did his research.  By the time we made our appointment to buy, he had a fully loaded car washed and prepped for our test drive.  We actually were presented with such a great deal on that car we test drove that we decided to purchase that same day.  Our experience was phenomenal,  we never felt pressured to buy.  We leased our new Lexus IS 350 and couldn't be happier. It handles beautifully and comes fully loaded.  We traded our old vehicle and were given fair market value.

Thank you very much Damian for your efforts in going above and beyond for us and also  extend our deep gratitude to the Lexus Team for making our shopping experience a memorable one.

Truly Grateful,

Elvi Solis and Frank Espinoza<//Review>

I drove a great distance to pick-up my new vehicle and Issa waited patiently for me to arrive... Issa even called the next day to ensure that I made it home safely, which was very kind of him....

But, Tim made it all happen. When I arrived, my new vehicle was ready and all I had to do was sign for it!!! Tim answered all of my questions and worked out a good deal for my trade-in.

Also, I was the last customer of the day and I know the team wanted to go home, but it didn’t dimenish the quality of service they extended to me. Natalie in the Finance Department was a pleasure to interact with... Lastly, I was escorted to my vehicle and the young man (forgot his name) took his time to explain the vehicle features. He was very nice, professional, and enthusiastic!!!

I would definitely recommend this dealership to my friends.... The whole experience was topnotch!!!!</text>< pictures>

I’ve told everyone that would listen (social media “friends” included) about how awesome Motor City is, so I was heartbroken to have been treated poorly by one particular individual.  I felt horribly having to involve Faraz but he’s been so helpful and kept his end of the bargain with my little questions here and there, so naturally he was the only one I felt comfortable dealing with.

Long story short, he did everything in his power to make sure that I was treated fairly and that I walked out of that dealership happy as a clam!
He got me to John Barajas who was just as helpful, and voila💥 it worked!

I will continue to do business with this dealership because anyone who can make me change my mind deserves my loyalty!</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x80ea6a9868f999ff:0x5815f25a041f5ef2< /GmapID></record>

My experience with Motor City, Salesman Angel Lozano, and the manager Nora was amazing! They were very helpful and straight forward on everything! Everyone was very personal, did not feel pushed or rushed for anything. It was a great experience and I would recommended few friends and family to them.</Review>

Sergio was very nice and easy going.  I walked in thinking I was going to just check out what they had available but because Sergio made it hard to walk away.  He was very knowledgeable and showed me numerous features which convenienced me to purchase the car.</text>

<Text>Ray Matley, Service Manager, goes beyond the call of duty to help and follows through until service is completed. John Barahas also was thorough and made sure everything was done properly on my car. I'm very happy with Lexus service department and all the staff.<//Text>< rate>

This has got to be the best experience I have ever had purchasing a car...new or used. My salesman, Jason, was the ultimate professional - courteous, knowledgeable, and personable. There is no doubt my next car will be another Lexus...and there is no doubt I will be contacting Jason when I do.<//Text>

< Review>
They serviced our vehicle. There is a list of the services and checks "performed". This document is given to the customer at check out. The document given to me had a section where it states the tires pressure is checked and recorded. There was no PSI value in this section. If they left this undone, then did they reallycheck the filters, belts, CV boots, axels,etc? Dont pencil whip this it is not a u finance lot, damnit, this a Lexus dealer.</Review>

There has been miscommunication and wrongly stated information given to me.  The service people have been very friendly to me, but there has been some lack of accuracy here and there.  For instance, during my last visit, I was told by the receptionist that there was no loaner car waiting for me, even though an appointment had previously (three days in advance) been made for a loaner car.  The information that the receptionists gave to me turned out not to be true.  The receptionist had found that there was a car waiting for me but failed, then, to tell me, so I had to Uber home, and then back again to pick up my car.  Secondly, during this same visit, I was told that my RX350 needed one shock absorber in the front replaced, and one in the back replaced.  However, my paperwork said that two rear shocks were replaced.  So I'm left wondering if there was miscommunication between the service advisor and the service tech, or if the service tech simply ended up replacing a wrong rear shock absorber. The pricing of work is also higher than more typical auto-repair places.  Since I concurrently had been having one of my other cars serviced at a different auto-repair shop, I took my completed Lexus paperwork to this well-known auto repair to see what they could have done two of my same repairs for, and they said it would have been $310.00 less had I had them do the work.  It is well-known that dealers charge more for work, but this is a very large difference. I also had a cut in my upholstery repaired on my passenger rear interior door.  All that I can say is that it is repaired, yes, but it doesn’t look great.  It is a bit bubbly/non-smooth.  I would have thought that a Lexus dealership would have supervised a higher quality of repair on it, even knowing that they out-source the work. Lastly, and to me, most significantly, since I had already met with the service manager and the general manager of this dealership explaining some of these problems to both of them in their office, I am disappointed by the fact that once I brought my vehicle home, I tried calling my service advisor on the shock absorber issue at 2:00pm the same day (July 18, 2018), and never received a call back.  I then called the following morniing at 9:00am, reached her, but she said she was busy with clients in her office and would call me back in a few minutes, which did not happen.  I have decided that as of today, with the exception of any future recalls that come out and have to be repaired, I will not take any of my vehicles back to this or any Lexus dealer for any servicing.  There is just something not "clicking" with them over there for me.</review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

My first experience at Motor City Lexus of Bakersfield was comparable to the luxurious car I bought. From the first greeting until I drove away, I was given excellent service by Demian Castillo, my salesperson, and everyone else I encountered there. Demian was very personable and easy-going, helping me as though I had been going there for years. I felt I was respected as a person and not just a car buyer. If any of my family or friends are interested in buying a Lexus, I will not hesitate to recommend Motor City Lexus.< /text>

The salesman Chris Arnold did a fantastic job. He met my expectations and provided a wealth of knowledge for my consideration for a purchase.  My disappointment was with the finishing department that checks the fluids and details the vehicle for customer delivery. after 1 hour my vehicle had not even been started. They said they were unaware the vehicle had been sold when I saw Chris provide the tag and keys to a vehicle runner who drove it back to the prep site. I had o bring the vehicle back to have it finalized. Unbelievable!!!!!!!!!</Review>

I just bought a beautiful GMC Canyon from Motor City and I couldn't be happier with my purchase or the experience my wife and I had with Danny Smart. In my opinion Danny is a true professional with years of experience and it really shows when you work with him. He made sure we got every incentive possible and that we were happy with our purchase. I will recommend Danny to all who ask without reservation.  Thanks again Danny and Motor City GMC.<//Review>

The reason I keep coming back is because of Jorge Espreza, Joe Busby and the excellent, courteous, knowledge, and deals that I have received in the past and present. They have gone beyond my expectations in the professional attitude that they emulate. Also, when it comes to service, they are 5* in my opinion. They are by far the best dealership in California and probably this side of the Ole Miss River.< /review>< date>

<text>I have never had such a great experience buying a car!! Our salesman Faraz Ahmed was exceptional. He made the car buying experience fun! I never felt pressure to buy. Faraz is definitely someone that I would highly  recommend if you're in the market to purchase a new Lexus.
I also worked with Richard in the finance department.  He also exceeded my expectations. Richard was so kind and explained everything in a way I could understand.  When signing the final papers I worked with Shelley. She too was very pleasant.
I would highly  recommend Motor City Lexus. They are  knowledgeable people that take their time to make sure you are happy!<//text>< Pics>

The internet sales manager was very professional and knowledgeable on the process, answered all my questions to my satisfaction. The sale was very quick and easy. I didn't have to drive to LA to get a car this time.<//review>

Our family could not have been more pleased with our experience with Alora at Motor City.  She was a joy to work with both with her professional expertise and friendliness.  They way we were treated during the entire process was unlike any other I have experienced in car shopping in my life. I would highly recommend Alora and Motor City to anyone in the market for a car.  - Troy Felix< /Review>

<review>I moved to town about a month ago and needed to buy a car sort of quickly. When I told this to Faraz at Motor City, he went above and beyond to help me get into a great car at a great price. He worked closely with me to find out my price range and the kind of things I was looking for. His recommendations were spot on and I couldn't be happier with my Certified Pre-Owned CT200H F Sport. Would highly recommend anyone looking to get a car go to Motor City Lexus and ask for Faraz!</review>< pics>

Motor City Lexus provides great service. And has a waiting area with all the Comforts of home. Unlike other service dealers Lexus schedules their service appointments well, so the waiting area is rarely crowded. For waiting customers they provide free Starbucks coffees, snacks, waster, and soda. The waiting areas are homey comfortable; and provide free Wi-Fi as well as recliners and Tv. You can comfortably work while you weight, or recline and take a nap. Most important the service is timely, and the staff appear to be happy and enjoy their jobs. They are courteous and responsible. They have often saved us money by telling us when repairs we assumed were necessary, were actually not needed. Keep up the good work Team Lexus. We are loyal customers.< /review>

Chris listened to all of my concerns, spoke with his manager and came up with a wonderful solution.  We signed the paperwork on a Wednesday evening, and both Brett and Chris followed up via text to let me know it was ready on Friday.

starFor the first time ever I bought my Lexus with Motor City Lexus of Bakersfield. We have always bought our cars in the Bay Area. From the very moment we met Joey Buoni from Lexus I knew we would be buying a car from him. He was not your typical car salesman. He was not pushy, listened to all of our needs, knew all about the cars. he was kind and very patient. I decided on what color I wanted, the type etc. Joey searched for me and in just a few days I was back at the dealer buying my new RX. Joey even came in on his day off. During the entire process from meeting the Director of Sales Ali Douglas who really worked with us on the price we wanted to pay, to the Finance Manager Sergio Martinez (my husband shared Army stories with him, oh my) to our Technology specialist Parker Christian everyone was wonderful to work with. We will be back! Thank you to the entire team for making buying a car actually fun and not painful! Colleen Bauer proud owner of a brand new Lexus RX.</text>

Easily the best dealership I've ever dealt with in regards to getting a car lease.  I've gotten over 10 leases in the past and dealing with Joey Buoni made life so easy.  From the first phone call in negotiating (if you even call it that) my deal to the day the car was delivered to my doorstep (I live in Las Vegas), every step was so naturally simple.  Just hoping that Joey is around when this lease expires so I can go through Motor City again for my next lease.< /review>

<review>It was so easy. I didnt feel pressured and we were able to test drive several cars before we decided. We wanted to make sure we had weighed all our options before making a decision and they were so patient with us. Our sales rep was very easy to work with and she worked up the numbers for several different deal options for us to choose from so we could pick the one that best fit our situation and comfort level with down payment and with monthly payments. Ive bought a lot of cars in my life and this was by far the smoothest and easiest process Ive been through. The entire staff made us feel comfortable and they gave us an extremely fair deal on our trade compared to other offers we had from other dealers. We couldnt be happier with our experience and most importantly our new car.<//review>< Pics>

<text>I had a bad experience in motor city lexus Bakersfield I took my car last month It had only 73,000 miles the problem was VSC( Vehicle Stability Control) on I paid for the fuel injection service so i got the car back,  next day VSC was on again! I took it back to motor city lexus Bakersfield they told me it was the top engine needed cleaning so here i go again paid  $900 service technician told me it will take roughly 10,000 miles to make VSC on again I got the car back I was only driving it for 200 miles and VSC was on again! I talked to their service manager he said it needed a total engine cleaning inside he just wanted me to pay a rough estimate $5,788 or could be more.. He also told me to trade-in my car for another lexus  I said no way how can I trust lexus car and service department? I ALWAYS put supreme gas and up to date on change oils so go figure...these people trying to make a lot of money out of me but no work or service is done.. Now I got me a new luxury car but not lexus.  No way!< /text>< pictures>

Wife and I just bought a used gx from Demian Castillo and I can’t begin to tell you how smooth and easy this all was.  48 hours ago we walked out of Newport Lexus when the gx we looked at there was a total lemon. When we left there it was back to the drawing board and that is when I found Demian and motor city Lexus. We have owned over 30+ cars and this was hands down the best experience by far! We live in Orange County and drove out there this morning ( 130 miles away and passed probably 10 other Lexus dealers on the way ) and picked up the car.  Demian and I ironed out all the numbers last night via text and as promised we were in and out in less than 90 minutes this Morning. Everyone there was very appreciative of our business and still very respectful of our time crunch and needing to get back on the road.  He took my request to get done fast seriously and made sure we had time to make it back to oc and pick up grandma on time from the airport. He made sure to put new batteries in both remotes , leather covers on them, key chains and a few Lexus mugs for my wife and I.  He was very thorough and not pushy at all.  This dealership is awesome and Demian is a perfect example of a car sales man who gets it.  I will never buy a Lexus anywhere else ever again.  I only wish they were closer to my house so I could use their service department.  Our deal was so smooth,  super easy and showed me that their are some car dealers that still value their customers.</Text>

<Review>Great Experience, Carlos Valdes was patient and took care of our needs. We were going back and forth between the GMC Denali Acadia and the Ford Explorer Sport for 6 months and Carlos stuck with us. Even through our drama in picking between the two vehicles, Carlos stuck to his word in getting us the best price he possibly could to meet our budget.</Review>< pics>

On  May 28th I call motor city Lexus to schedule a appointment for a  fuel injectors clean with  Ange service advisor.  When  my wife arrived at 8am June 2nd 2018 for the appointment Angel was off and she had to talk to Bruce. Bruce wrote the car for her and told my wife she was getting a loaner that the service would be done in two and a half hours so by 11:00am.
I called Bruce to find out why he had.not call us to pick the car up. His reply was when you take a loaner you get put back until the end of the day which he never explained to my wife . We started arguing and he started to raise his voice at me and that conversation didn’t end well. We had to be in Los Angeles by 4:00pm I told that we would have take the loaner and bring it back on Monday morning. He told I was going to be charged $90dlls per for his mistake Bruce response was well We have no service the car if you want it like that you can come and pick it up that was his resolution to the problem. So drove to the dealer and ask for someone in management Jake came over to assist me nice guy.  I told  Jake about the situation and said take the loaner I will eat the cost off the rental for the inconvenience this was at 1325pm.
I left home It was really strange that the vehicle was not in service while I was there at the dealership but within 45 minutes of me leaving the dealership bruce calls me to tell me that was ready. I question Bruce that it only took 45 minutes to service my car when he said it was two hours and a half I strongly believe that nothing was done to my vehicle. That I paid for something that was rushed or not done at all.
I have left a message for the service manager to give me a call his name is Ray which I had to call him for days later and leave a message reminding him to call me back whe n  Ray call me back  Ray said I thought it was taken care already. I explain to Ray the situation and he said that he wanted my to bring the car back so they can take it apart and show me it was done properly. Any guy that knows about cars knows that the throttle body could have been clean but how can they prove to me they service the injectors.
Mr. John Petri I have already lost 5 hours of work on this past Monday the fourth because I had to go back to the dealership to pick up my car because the work was not done  on Saturday the 2nd.
To anyone that reads this review be careful when you take your car to be serviced at Motor City Lexus they cover for their employees mistakes. I believe I should get refunded for the amount I paid for 45 minute service after I complain.< /review>

<Text>What a fantastic car buying experience! Jaber knew what our needs were, and found a car that fit those needs.    Always optimistic and trustworthy, Jaber made our experience painless, and we are so happy with our purchase.  Nora was fun and accommodating.   The whole team actually made buying a car a positive experience.  Motor City went above and beyond for our family.  Thank you, Jaber and Nora!<//Text>< pictures>

He answered all of my questions,  and those of my 2 small grandkids.  He got me a great deal and I didn't have to do the long process of negotiations.  He walked me through the entire process. It was a pleasure dealing with Frank and the entire GMC staff. So far I am more then satisfied with my Terrain.

I had a wonderful experience at motor city Lexus. my sales associate Peter De Keles was kind and so helpful and new I was very stressed since I had been in a car accident and my previous car was Lexus.   He eased my mind and found me a great new Lexus  ! The fact that Peter has a finance background and made him even more helpful in making my descision .  He was so patience and not like a high pressure  sales person At all! He and his team found me the best car !  You need to give this man a raise since he is excellent.   Maria Longo</review>

Demian has been absolutely fantastic! I purchased a 2014 GX460 from him. I live in Denver and this was the 1st time I purchased a car out of state. Demian has walked me through the entire process, he has had excellent communication and provided A+ customer service. I will definitely consider your dealership if I ever need another Lexus. Great job Demian and Team!< /review>

Traveling from Washington, never a good thing when your away from home and buy a car private party and hit freeway and it's shutting off at 60 with our kids in vehicle. Called bakersfield motor city lexus and said we were on freeway 20 mins away. They didn't even question getting us in for a diagnostic. Tony was nothing but a  professional service man. Provided us the most kind service we have seen in a long time. And Juan was an awesome polite service guy. Figured out our problem immediately got us back on road to home stretch. We will definitely always recommend this motor city lexus. Thank you guys again. Kindness and professionalism goes along way.<//Text>

Jorge Oropeza was a great person to work with while purchasing our new LaCrosse.  He provided all of the information needed to make our decision yet allowed us the opportunity to talk and explore the vehicles we were considering without feeling pressured or always at our side.  This allowed us to talk it over frelly while making our decision.  He also allowed us ample opportunity to test drive each vehicle without feeling rushed.  This kind of service and treatment, as well as the fantastic service we get in the service department is why we keep coming back to Motor City to purchase our new vehicles.</Review>

<text>I had received the recall notice from Lexus, about the airbag situation with Takata.

I had only bought my used 2011 ES 350, a car I truly loved. Best I had ever owned... on 7/20/16. It was less than a year, I had owned it. My options given to me by corporate,  we're a rental (far cheaper quality) for minimum 6 months, or no one can ride in my passenger seat, until a fix is available. Maybe January of next year.

I went to my Lexus dealer, I bought the car from. I had a wonderful experience the first time. The Service Manager dealt with me personally, he brought the Sales Manager into it. Between them, they offered to make it right, if I wanted to trade the car in. A car, none of us could really do anything with.

That's when Rocky Tayeh, an Assistant Sales Manager entered the picture. He was asked if he could help me pick out something special, and they would try to make things right.

Rocky and I talked for a few minutes, while we walked to the cars. By the time we reached the lot, he knew which car he thought I might like. We end up at the same color, 2015 ES 350, updated model of my car. Obviously, very updated since 2011.

I looked at the price and Rocky noticed me cringe a bit. It was a L-Certified loaner car. Listed at a premium price. Rocky said, not to worry about that, they were gong to take care of me.

We went inside to talk a deal. I asked for a few concessions, he went to talk to the Sales Manager and they came back, with a deal... better than I asked for. They not only gave me full trade-in value for my old car, which they have to sit on, at least 6 months. They even added some to its value. They offered me the car at a price attractively below, what it was listed for. They offered me a finance rate, lower than I could get, if I borrowed the money from myself , through the credit union.

Just a very nice deal, on a great car... with zero haggling! Every question I had, Rocky had an answer, or he got one. He hooked me up with the Finance Manager, who had all the details, and we breezed through the paperwork. He was very clear, and I understood, everything... no behind the back, hidden fees. Heck, they took care of some of the fees I would normally have had to pay.

I saved thousands of dollars on a very nice Lexus. Thanks in large part to Rocky Tayeh. He's easy going, very respectful, and listens to people. I would most certainly buy a car from him again. Some day, I might. I consider Motor City Lexus, my car dealership. I always have a pleasant experience when I go there, with honest, friendly people. Best car dealership I've ever done business with. They always make you feel welcome.</text><Pics>None</Pics><name>John Hoover</name><Date>1468963557854</Date><Rating>5</Rating><gmapID>0x80ea6a9868f999ff:0x5815f25a041f5ef2</gmapID><Response>None<//Response><UserId.>106969071622714642988<//UserId.></record></dataset><record>

Thanks again for helping us get our car and giving us an awesome deal. You were extremely patient and professional, and you didn't make us feel pressured or rushed.

We'll definitely recommend you to our friends and/or family looking to get a new car.

Our salesman, Sami Ayoub was no exception.  He had an astonishing ability to figure out exactly what we needed and to communicate important information about GMC trucks quickly and precisely.  He never pushed us in a direction we did not what go.  His answers to our questions always went straight to the heart of the matter.  Best experience we've had in 50 years of buying cars.

<userid>116684373582622280779</userid><Date>1473254299994</Date><Text>I can say, without reservation, that my recent car leasing experience at Bakersfield's Motor Ciry Lexus was the most comfortable, professional, and stress-free dealership encounter I have ever had. My product specialist, Faraz Ahmed, seemed genuinely concerned that I receive exactly what I desired in my new vehicle. I honestly feel that I could have walked away at any point and not have been pressured or stalked as in other encounters with car salesmen in the past....this is a big factor in why I stayed and continued to pursue a car here. The positive experience continued with the finance dept. The process was paperless with all forms signed on a tabletop touchscreen and, once again, relaxed, cordial, and stress-free. I left with the assurance I would have ongoing support from the dealership throughout the time I have this vehicle, a Lexus NX 200t. As a final note, a former customer of Mr. Ahmed came by while we were discussing some details regarding the car and mentioned that he was looking for a new vehicle and asked Faraz to keep an eye out for him. Repeat customer who was obviously very pleased with the ongoing service he had received from this specialist. Sounds like a good sign to me. Do not hesitate to buy or lease a car from Motor City. They are customer-focused and have a well-conceived marketing strategy that truly fits today's consumer. Thanks for an outstanding experience.</Text>< pics>

<resp>None</resp><text>I was referred to your dealership, and to Mr. Chris Arnold, one of your sales staff, by a friend.  In addition, my son had purchased a 2014 GMC Sierra truck and he has really enjoyed it.  Wanting to do some preparation prior to my first visit to your  business, I began speaking with owners of GMC trucks everywhere I encountered them, to find out how well they liked their trucks.  I found one gentleman who is on his 4th GMC truck and he raved about it, and that helped me decide that I really wanted a new Sierra.  I was treated very well by Mr. Arnold and he patiently helped me while I decided just what I wanted.  The  whole purchasing experience was low pressure, informative and cordial.</text>< Name>

I highly recommend GMC Motor City for your next vehicle purchase  I also highly recommend you ask for Sami Ayoub. Sami works extremely hard at finding you the best deal.  In my opinion,  he goes above and beyond any other car salesman that I have ever dealt with.< /text>

< review>
I recently went in to buy a 2016 GMC Canyon diesel 4x4 and I was greeted by Omar and we promptly went on a test drive as usual but during the test drive I realized very quickly that this was going to be alot easier than I had planned (so i pummed my self up in the mirror at home for nothing).  I was told by Omar that we will talk pricing and that there would be no pressure and he was not lying.  The selection was good and everything I wanted was there and redy to roll.  The process was quick and simple and I was in and out in about 1 1/2 with friendly low pressure service in a very clean environment with the truck ive been waiting years for and a price I couldnt beat.
Very happy with this place</review>

<text>My experience with Motor City GMC was nothing short of Excellent !
Seeing that this review will be available to anyone online, I'd like say first that I'm a retired person, up in the years and along with that comes years of experiences. I've bought several cars & trucks throughout the years from many different dealers and salespeople. Motor City GMC has raised the bar of excellent customer service and there's no doubt in my mind, that the reason they've been able to do that, is because of my salesperson Sami Ayoub. Not only is Sami the customers best advocate in getting a great deal on a new vehicle, he quickly and easily helped me  through understanding the operations of the many advanced systems available on GMC trucks today. Great dealership EXCELLENT SALESMAN!<//text><Response>None<//Response><userid>114349568483832234884<//userid></record>

<Text>Mark Musleh was the sales associate who walked me through the purchase of my beautiful 2016 Buick LaCrosse.  Mark was a pleasure to work with as he was quite patient and knowledgable, and he answered my questions and concerns thoroughly.  All staff I encountered in my experiece at Motor City Buick, GMC, Lexus added to the value this company works to share with their patrons.</Text><Gmap_id>0x80ea6a9868f999ff:0x5815f25a041f5ef2< /Gmap_id>< Pics>

<Review>I had an amazing experience, Hedi help is over the phone and was very sweet and knowledgeable about the different car packages available. This is actually the 4th dealership I called before anyone sounded like they knew What they were taking about. We did find a Suv we were interested in and Analisa was the one who assisted us when we visited the dealership. We did end up buying the car and everyone was very professional and made the experience amazing. There was a Manager named Ali who walked by and introduced him self, and was very kind. This isn't my first time at a dealership and usually managers walk by without even looking at a customer. Analisa made sure we were happy during our stay and went out of her way to get us anything we asked for. I look forward to doing business with this Lexus dealership just because of how nice the staff were. Thank you for my New GX 460.< /Review><Time>1479151025094< /Time><pics>None<//pics>< Name>

I have always owned vehicles made by Volvo, BMW and Honda.  In 1998, I bought my first American made vehicle, a GMC 1500 extended cab truck. I bought this from Motor City GMC, then at that time located on Union Avenue.  Since then I have purchased  4 trucks and 4 Suburbans / Yukon XLs.

The transactions have always been similar.  A bottom line price is presented to me and I have always accepted the price, which is for most part much lower than sticker.  Mr. Stricklen has always taken good care of me and certainly look forward to purchasing another vehicle from Motor City GMC in the future.<//Review>

<review>I found the Lexus dealership in Bakersfield to be very professional, friendly and relaxed.  I was not approached by a salesperson in an aggressive manner like I have experienced in other car sale situations.  It was definitely a very easy-going manner in which the receptionist first approached me and asked if I would like to speak with someone regarding any of the cars.  I first spoke with Heidi who let me discover all the wonderful aspects of the Lexus GX and LX and answered any questions I had.  When I came on a second day I spoke with Marsella, who was very knowledgeable, honest , and very friendly.  On the third day I visited the dealership, I spoke with Sergio, who was equally as wonderful as the other two sales people that I had met with previously.  I appreciated the fact that if he did not know the answer to a question, he admitted that and found the answer immediately.  He was very professional and kind.   I must mention also that Jashan  also was wonderful and very informative as he helped  me to review and sign the sale contract.  He is a great asset to the team there at Lexus because he has a very kind, assuring, and honest manner about him.<//review>< Pictures>

I've been to a lot of dealerships and I have had some pretty bad experiences, but when we arrived at motor city we had a great deal stress due to car problems and not wanting to have to spend more money to fix a car that wasn't going to last another year, but after one hour at motor city we were able to de-stress , and the staff made it easy on us, we found the car we wanted and that took care of everything, we drove away very happy , I recommend motor city to anyone looking for transportation, Thanks so much folks, and God bless you all.<//Text>
