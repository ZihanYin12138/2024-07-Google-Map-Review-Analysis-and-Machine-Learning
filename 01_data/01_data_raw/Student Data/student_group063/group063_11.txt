Order got delivered by post mates . I paid $30 dollars for this. Some chips and a side of guacamole. What a waste of money. I am very disappointed with this service. I support you guys way to much for the disrespect. Have some pride in what you do and provide people with the same service you would like to be provided.
Does it look like there’s extra meat in here ? What the hell is up with that cheese ??? This looks like a 5 year old prepared it. Smh. How do I get a refund??</Text>

The server at the counter was in a hurry. As he poured the food into my bowl some of the food items fell in other food items. A few of the rice fell into the beans container. Chicken was mixed into the beef container. There were green salad in the cheese container. It was a mess. Not satisfied with the service today.< /review>

I eat here a lot since I work right next to it. I must say their service is always fantastic and they keep the place well kept all the time. Pricing is affordable and they serve sizeable portions.< /text>

<review>This review is long overdue. This has to be thee best Chipotle I’ve ever been to. The staff is professional and friendly. The manager (Frida) remembers my name every time I walk in. Reading some of the other reviews about the servings being somewhat smaller compared to other franchises may be true to an extent however, I keep coming here because of the people. Also, I consistently see them cooking fresh food, cutting avocados, etc. As long as people like Frida are there, this will be my “go-to” location. Thank you!!</review>< Pics>

Stop training your employees to give out small servings to full grown adults. If I wanted a kid's meal, I'd go to McDonalds.

I am no longer a fan of this Chipotle or its service. I used to come here every few weeks and I enjoyed it, but now I don’t. The new workers aren’t like the old ones. They aren’t as friendly or welcoming. Not to mention, they don’t give you a lot of portions. Presentation is always terrible. One of the workers was practically rushing to make my order even though business was slow at the moment. The manager doesn’t seem that welcoming either. I will no longer be coming here. This Chipotle has lost its spark.< /Text>

This Chipotle is so much better cuz they don't charge extra if you're making a veggie queso. Other Chipotle's charge you for the price of a burrito cuz you add beans. That's a veggie, no? Always come here< /Text>

First and last time I come to eat at this location. Never thought employees can be so stingy with their servings. Like if it's hurting their own pocket!!<//text>

Excellent staff, pristine conditions, wonderful food.  One of the few locations that doesn't give you huge chunks of hard avocado in the side guacamole.<//Review>

The food was not fresh when I got there. The staff was cooking since most of the food supply was low or empty, and that looked like leftovers from the day before. The restaurant had been open for only 3 hours or so. Now a couple of us are nursing upset stomachs.<//Text>

" I had never been in here b4 and so my oldest daughter asked me if I wanted 2 go & look around. So I went & I ❤❤❤❤ed what I seen. I bought this Storage container which I was able to keep storage of my hair products, & miscellaneous items in. I plan on going back 2 get a few more items 2 buy & give as gifts. Not over pricey very reasonable within my budget!!!"<//Text>

<Text>Sylvia Alexander & cherie were extremely helpful and generous with their time today. I can not thank them enough. This was one of 100 photos I took for my wife , but consider this a high five to the team at this store. I hope I never have to come back , but I guarantee that my wife and mother in law's will. Really appreciate their help. Thanks ladies!<//Text>< Gmap_id>

Walked in the store and was greeted by ROSE. I am a decorator and I I am at a HomeGoods almost every day. Sometimes twice a day. I asked if I could leave my huge cart full of items near the front that needed to be returned. Rose told me no I would have to get in line and return them and then I can continue shopping. I had to wait in line twice. She said it wasn’t that bad. Never had this experience before.< /Text>

Don't hesitate for a moment to "buy it when you see it" because it won't be there when you go back after you make up your mind. There is something for every room of your house including the dog house. Fun fun fun stuff! Take your time to browse and you will be thrilled by what you find! And the staff from the moment you enter to the moment you leave  are helpful & pleasant. Happy hunting!< /text><rate>5< /rate></record></dataset><record>

<Response>None<//Response><Review>Super well stocked store. Of 3 I go to, depending on direction I'm in, this is my favorite. I can't say why, but maybe larger, overall. Next to Kohls store, parking to front or right side, coming from Los Alamitos Blvd.. Clean Restrooms, left side of back wall. If you like something, better to buy, and return, than to come back and find it gone!!  Not sure, during Pandemic, but product turnover prior to that, was high. Keep your receipt, I've never had a return issue.  Register areas redone, to provide more ''social distancing''.< /Review>< UserId.>

David saved me so much time! He picked up the 10 items I needed from IKEA, and came on time and worked quickly. I was impressed with how fast he worked. He got it done within 3 hours. If I had done it myself I would have probably needed at least a whole day. Save yourself the trouble and use this service!</Review>

I am a HomeGoods fan. I can come here for unexpected rare finds at affordable pricing. The staff are nice and helpful and I always leave here happier than when I come in. Thank you!</review>

< review>
We came looking for a table runner, and we found two that are perfect. And then two sets of place mats, and tea towels, and a fruit bowl, and two boxes of Ralph Lauren tumblers, a lovely chrome salt&pepper set, and a kitchen mat, and a giant sweet-smelling candle and glass vase, and... all for less than $190! We didn't even venture to the pet or furniture sections ("Next time," we said).<//review>

Thank goodness you are located far away! I'd spend all my paychecks away if I could visit more frequently. You won't walk away empty handed with all the unique finds in this store.</Text>

Bought a 5 ft mirror . Very nice cashier rang me up, very courteous but did not ask if I need help to my car. Thought I could do it on my own but struggled a little and one of the customers helped me. That's the reason I gave 3 stars.< /text>

It's a little chaotic in there but certain items have amazing deals. I found a few organic food products for half of what I pay at Organic Markets.. so way cool for that. Oh also beware of the rude customers hogging the aisles and running you over with their carts. 😡</review>

Good store layout I like that they group by color since most people have an idea what color they want but not necessarily what they want. If you see it buy it, it might not be there tomorrow.</Text>

Home Goods in Los Alamitos CA is well stocked and very neat but the line to check out is soooo long & moves soooo slowly! For that reason I am not a fan 😕< /Review>

Five years ago this would have been a 5 star rave review of a store that was unique and full of bargains and unusual gift and home wares-In other words "I USED to love Home Goods"...it would be almost impossible to maintain the high level of shopping excitement that Home Goods USED to generate and seriously they didn't maintain that ;level-I believe this is a part of the TJ MAXX, Marshalls group and often you can find the same items across the various brands. You can still find a great buy if you are tenacious and visit often but just not what it used to be and not worth the effort anymore<//text>

<text>The Snug offers a comfortable, gentleman's club atmosphere along with tasty and creative cocktails. I came here with my girlfriend and I ordered the world's best gin and tonic. It was good but different. Didn't even come off as a gin and tonic, as the main flavors were cucumber and rosemary. It wasn't what I was expecting, but I appreciate the creativity and mixup. I would definitely be coming back and try another cocktail.<//text>< Pics>

<text>The Snug is remeniscent of a speakeasy. Tucked in around the side of the main stretch off R St, you'll walk through a large set of wooden doors into the dim but bustling bar. The Snug is decorated with classic wallpaper, lounge chairs, wall sconces, and a warthog. Despite it being busy, the bartenders are efficient. We had drinks in hand minutes after arriving. The cocktail choices are well crafted and interesting. If a classic cocktail isn't your jam, there is a great selection of local beers on tap and wine as well.

All in all, outstanding drinks, outstanding service. We'll definitely be back.< /text>< pictures>

The crew is amazing and thus the drinks are too. Great for friends or a first date.
Great atmosphere with low lighting and comfy sexy lounging. The decor consists of brick, metal, dark wood and plants.
Music gets a little loud on crowded nights - nothing crazy though.
** no food but they allow you to bring in from the awesome restaurants just feet away.<//review>

This bar is my top choice in Sacramento. I love craft cocktails and they know how to do it right! I ordered a Lion’s Tail, which isn’t on the menu and it was one of the best Lion’s Tails I’ve ever had. The outdoor area is quite pleasant.</review>

The Snug is very nice. Beautiful aesthetics and drink menu. Especially recommend the Penicillin if you like a whiskey cocktail. Fun and lively environment.

<user_id>104037524980967008271< /user_id><review>Very nice!  It's tough to pull off, but the atmosphere here is upscale and simultaneously unpretentious.  The bartenders are extremely hospitable, and helpful if you're unsure, to guide you toward a drink you'll love.  I went in with the goal of trying some irish whiskeys.  There's one I really love, and i wanted to see if I could find another.  The barkeep on duty that night suggested 2, ond poured me samples.  One knocked my socks off.  Having solved one mystery, I tried something from the mixed menu.  Very tasty, and reasonably priced.  I had 2 while reading a novel.  Looks like the place is generally frequented by members of the state workforce who have to wear dress shoes.< /review><Name>Kevin Gaines< /Name>< Response>

< Review>
Alright so interior is quite nice but I felt like they could have done more with the wide open space by the bar to make it more "snug" like. There are a few booths and lounge chairs in a couple areas but thats about it. Also the menu was quite short on cocktails they had. I want to say the place has something of a jungle-bird feel to it, only... different in its own way if that makes sense. Also when we walked in to the bar area, a server walked right up to us and sat us and make recommendations based on what we liked whoch was really cool. Its a cute spot  and I think the place has potential for sure.< /Review>

<review>Such great decor and many excellent cocktails! Redolent of 1920s style if it had a baby with the 1970s. Comfortable and brown in tone. Late night it gets funky with a disco ball and hits from the 1980s through the 2010s (mostly older stuff). The crowd can get a little bro-y, but that's not the venue's fault and it really isn't too bad, especially as compared with other bars nearby.</review><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x809ad1f958f9ee9b:0xd7e831a4da4f580a< /Gmap_id></record>

This place is really different for a Sacramento bar. It gives me a feel of unique "snug" places you get in New York. And to top it off, the Penicillin is untouchable here! Hands down 1 of the best Penicillins I've had.

My only complaint (as my fam and I have come here ALOT) was that the service was really bad a certain night at the bar. Pretty disappointed in the racial profiling. Lindsay and Tony- who are known as great bartenders- provided no service as we sat there. Lindsay ignored us and helped other customers that came up to the bar after us. Tony at least acknowledged us but didn't bother to even ask if he could get something started for us, as he clearly wasn't making anyone else's drinks at that moment. Eventually we found seating else where and got serviced by Carrie- who made up for the lack of customer service from them. Those drinks and the quality of them "now" may still keep some customers happy, but you definitely are not respected as person with character. You should be aware of how you treat your customers.</Text>

The food was really good. I ordered the Chicken Curry lunch special and everything tasted fresh. The Spinach naan was very delicious and I'm not a fan of Spinach. Our server was very friendly. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone that's looking for delicious Indian food around the area. I'll be back.< /Review>

An excellent place for lunch. Came in with my boyfriend around 3pm. Other Indian places in the area had already stopped serving buffet, but we came in and were served buffet right away. Great options, and fair price!</text>

Don’t just do publicity with displaying pics with celebrities.. Serve good quality food.. Don’t embarrassed all other Indian people by serving this quality food... Big No to this restaurant.. 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼<//review>

When I moved back to Sherman Oaks it took some time to find an Indian restaurant that made good Chicken Tikka, most of what I tried at other places tasted bland.  Bollywood Bites Chicken Tikka is absolutely delicious, it’s really fresh and flavorful and the garlic naan is beyond tasty too.  plus the staff is super nice.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Went there on Thanksgiving day. Long wait for food probably due to a busy kitchen handling take out orders. Food was okay at best. Have had much better Indian food elsewhere in SoCal.</text>

Some items on the menu are amazing and legit, others are equally on the opposite side of the spectrum!

WHATS GREAT 80 per cent of the time:
Paneer tikka Masala
Saag paneer
Butter paneer
BIRIYANI (surprisingly)
Naans

DO NOT ORDER:
pav Bhaji
Any chaat (Indian street food)
Chana Bhatura
Gulab jamun is OK... very doughy...

If everything was as good as the good stuff I’d give it 5 stars... but the fact that the menu is a hit or miss and you never know when what is going to be great is a little disappointing. I’ve eaten here many times and there isn’t much consistency in the quality...but when it’s good, it’s GREAT!</text>

<Rate>3</Rate><text>Hmm....Decent place to have Indian food but then almost every Indian restaurant in Los Angeles falls in that category.  Most all are overhyped and none that I have found close to that Indian flavor. Mostly have Bangladeshi influences, including this one but certainly not Indian flavors. Unless u have tried Indian food in India or London, you would not relate to what I am talking about. The truck is what got me started and I do enjoy the Westwood location better.<//text>< Pictures>

Just not authentic, although the quality of the ingredients seemed pretty good.

The Chicken Tikka Masala was cheesy tasting and had an almost Italian flavor. It would actually go very nice over some fusilli pasta, with some grated parmesan and a pinch of basil. I know I seem like I'm joking but I'd actually be tempted to order this on a movie night to share with some pizza.</Text><pics>None</pics>< response>

It was really hard to find good Indian food when we were in Los Angeles last week. Thanks to our friend who recommended us Bollywood Bites in Sherman Oaks location. The ambience was amazing and food surpasses any Indian food I have had before. Tried the naan wrap, chicken tikka masala and tandoori fish.

I am definitely going to Bollywood Bites anytime I am in LA. Craving it already. Highly recommended!</review>

With my family we ordered quiet a lot Indian Street food, Kathi roll, samosa Chaat, Pav Bhaji, Pani Puri and traditional Chicken Tikka Masala, Lamb Vindaloo, Kadai Paneer, Gia Fish Coconut Curry, Tandoori Shrimp, lamb biryani, spinach and garlic Naan, Mango Lassi and their special vegan mango lassi....me and my Indian family all felt, flavors were beyond expectations, so authentic, perfectly spiced as asked. The proof was all this food we 5 ate every everything with no leftovers for to/go. Can’t wait to come back to LA just to come back to Bollywood Bites👍😊<//Text>< Rating>

The food was pretty good. We got the sag paneer, naan, eggpland and chicken tandoori. The eggplant was excellent. I was surprised by how empty the place was. The papadum and chutney was tasty.</text>

I love that this place just opened up walking distance from me! I Love Indian food and have eaten it all around the world!

I ordered the chicken Khati roll.
Here are the pros:
-lots of chicken
-tasty

Cons:
-has salad in it that goes soggy
-there’s so much masala sauce in it that the burrito soon falls apart
-the chicken was on the dry side

The roll should have less masala sauce and shouldn’t have salad. Perhaps rice instead? An Indian burrito with rice, chicken tikka, a bit of masala sauce with raita, tamarind chutney and mint chutney would be excellent - an Indian burrito!

Romantic setting with good atmosphere and nice staff!</Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

The food was really horrible. Ordered chole bhatura and Pau bhaji and both of the dishes were horrible. In chole bhature the chole (garbanzo beans) were not cooked fully and bhatura we're super oily and hard. In Pau bhaji, bhaji was ok but the Pau/bread were super hard and again so oily. I had high hopes from this place but was really disappointed.<//review>

<text>New place! Good ambience. Food is delicious and there is a good mix of different street foods like pav bhaji but also noveou ideas like capsicum stuffed with lamb.

Edit: Came here a second time and I'm noticing a trend. The lamb is chopped into really big pieces. Even though the stuffed capsicum says kheema or minced. This meat tastes good but the consistency is not right for this dish. This time around, we ordered a lamb kathi roll and again lamb pieces were too large. As for the pav bhaji, it is not mashed on a tawa like you expect. Overall, the taste is not compromised but the texture does suffer. If there was a choice, 3.5 stars.<//text>< GmapID>

What can I say? Dr Mowlovi is exceptional at his craft. I could not have chosen a better surgeon. The office staff made me feel as though I was family. I would go back for any further treatment or surgery; without a second thought.< /Review>

<Review>My husband recently had surgery with Dr. Laguna and is beyond happy with his results. Dr. Laguna has an amazing bedside manner and is very passionate about his work. From pre-op to post-op, Dr. Laguna's  staff has been very attentive to his needs and helpful in navigating the surgical process. Jasmine, his lymphatic massage therapist, has been beyond amazing, and the lymphatic massages themselves have been highly beneficial to his post-op care. Overall, Dr. Laguna and his staff are wonderful and I would highly recommend!</Review></record></dataset><record>
<pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp><review>Let me start from the end. My results post op are AMAZING. My abs and flanks are shredded and I have a double V pointing South. Dr Laguna (Dr. Mowlavi) is a brilliant surgeon, artist and sculptor when it comes to Vasor Liposuction. If you want to remove the apprehension, unknowns and anxiety of how your going to look and feel and want that comfort and confidence that you are going to have incredible results; put your body in the hands of Dr. Laguna; you can relax now. He runs a 5 star practice.

I’m a 46 year old male that ate a somewhat healthy diet  for years while working out regularly 5-6 days a week. The course of nature started reclaiming the work I’ve been putting in by enveloping my abdomen; chest and back with layers and rolls of fat that would ultimately strip me of the definition I once had. I was losing myself and at a crossroads. Let go and concede to the process of aging or undergo liposuction.

I made the decision to have Vasor liposuction; but the stressful overwhelming question was who to trust. I decided to search out the Dr. with the best reviews and highest ratings and without question; Dr. Laguna stood out by far. I called; then eventually met with the Dr. and Claudia who was absolutely wonderful and walked me through the whole process. I could not have been made to feel more comfortable and through everything I gathered through the consultations i went ahead with the procedure.

Following the procedure I was whisked away to a surgical recovery suite where I had 24 hour monitoring by nurses who took meticulous care of me (Thank you Samaya) The following day I was brought back to Dr. Mowlavi’s office for my first of 7 lymphatic massages. I cannot stress enough; those massages are blessings that steadily and continuously pull you up and recalibrate your body back to the path of normalcy. My massage therapist Theresa was a beacon of light; a source of strength, comfort and a beautiful spirit of energy and healing that transcended through her hands.

In the end, I’m healing wonderfully and mission accomplished. Dr. Laguna not only returned my body to pre-fat but then took it up another 1,000 levels where my physique is nothing short of Stunning and jaw dropping. If you can; DO IT !!!!!<//review>< user_name>

From beginning to end, Dr. Mowlavi and his team took care of me and made sure I felt comfortable throughout the whole process.  I couldn’t be happier with the results and wouldn’t hesitate to recommend him to anyone who wants plastic surgery done RIGHT!  Thank you, Dr Mowlavi!<//text>

I had the best experience with Dr Mowlavi during my breast augmentation! I was nervous before surgery but he and his staff made me feel so comfortable during the whole process. I am now a month post op, feeling confident and loving my results! Thank you Dr Mowlavi and everyone at Cosmetic Plastic Surgery Institute!<//review>

Amazing, the entire process from the consultation, surgery to after care massages. Dr M is very personal and hands on during the entire process. James and Claire were always there anytime I had a question. But my favorite was Theresa the massage therapist, I even booked four extra massages, she is such a kind, loving and genuine person.</Review>

After losing over 160 lbs, I was struggling to find a doctor who could help me with my loose skin and help me achieve my dream body after all my hard work. With Dr. Mowlavi, I found a true gem of a surgeon. He executed my wants and desires and i couldn’t be any happier. He had a wonderful bedside manner and never made me feel insecure, starting from my initial consultation in which I felt the most vulnerable in my own skin. For anyone who has undergone extreme weight loss and is looking for the next step in achieving their dream body goals, I would highly recommend Dr. Mowlavi. You will not be disappointed!</Review>

Worst surgeon you’ll ever meet. I’ve been to a couple of surgeons and none have treated me the way this guy did. He only cares about easy procedures that will benefit him. The most arrogant dude you’ll ever meet.

Let me tell you.. I walk in and the receptionist are nice and all. As soon as I go Into one of the rooms, Doctor takes a look at me and bluntly says “let me see, no theres nothing I can do” he didn’t even try to give me options, explanations or anything.

I also feel he bluntly racially profiles you. I say this because I’m a 25 year old Latino male and don’t have a good insurance, (I overheard him talking to his receptionist about my insurance) but why do I need insurance if I have the money to pay right?

Trust me save your money. Based on that experience alone I can tell you he does not care about his patients. I wouldn’t let this guy near my face.</review>

Dr. Mowlavi and his staff are amazing. When I came in for my first consultation he was just on point and understood what I wanted and visualized how I would look. I still had my doubts so I came for a second consultation and he just made me feel that the decision I was making was just right. After surgery the care and the whole process recovery has been amazing. Planning everything accordingly and setting appointments has worked with my schedule and just a overall amazing experience. My friends and family are excited and looking forward to seeing my results and set up there consultation with him.<//Review>

I finally came to Dr. Mowlavi after 3 rounds of botched liposuction, as well as a faulty tummy tuck incision line. I cannot be happier with my results and I wish I went with Dr. Mowlavi from the start. Dr. Mowlavi is truly an excellent, skilled surgeon and body sculptor. I am one-month post-op and I am in love with my hourglass figure - something I have been trying to achieve since the beginning of my cosmetic surgery journey. My post-op care with James, Dr. Mowlavi’s surgical tech, has been exceptional. James is so patient and understanding and is truly a delight to speak to about post-surgical care.  Theresa, my massage therapist, has been awesome as well with the post-lymphatic massages. I have always felt at home with Dr. Mowlavi and his staff and I would highly recommend Dr. Mowlavi to anyone in need of cosmetic procedures!<//text>

I was very scared going into this surgery, however from the get go Dr. Mowlavi was very reassuring and gentle, which made me feel as though I was in excellent hands. Though the surgery was going go be painful, Dr. Mowlavi made me feel at ease and I knew the surgery was going to result in a great outcome.

<review>Dr Mowlavi was fantastic but not to mention his staff. His team was ON IT. Anything I needed after my surgery they helped me with. I had their phone numbers and they were responsive day and night. I think it’s one thing for a doctor to do great work but without a great team patients are left feeling upset and Dr Mowlavi has found a fantastic team to ensure that doesn’t happen.

My results are exactly as expected. I have literally no fat left in my waist and have hips. Pretty cool to wake up to :)<//review>< pictures>

< Review>
Dr Mowlavi and his staff are amazing! I have been considering my surgery for many years and just never could muster up the courage to do it. When I walked through the door at Dr Mowlavi’s office for my original consultation, I felt welcomed and so comfortable. Dr Mowlavi is the kindest, most down to earth doctor. He listens, advises and helps you make the best decision possible for your wants.
The process of gearing up for surgery was so easy. His staff.... AWESOME! From the front office staff greeting you warmly every time you walk through the door, to Claudia preparing everything you need for surgery, to after care lymphatic massage with the absolutely amazing Jasmine. James, basically the Superman of the office, has been amazing as well. So professional, funny and helpful and available.
I just can’t say enough about how great the whole entire process was. I recommend Dr Mowlavi and his team with my whole heart. You will be comfortable, cared for by compassionate staff and satisfied with your results.
The after care program he offers is so beneficial and will bring you the results you were looking for when you first started your journey of having surgery. Thank you Dr Mowlavi and staff. My words could never express my gratitude for the care you gave me.</Review>

<Text>My second time here, I really love the doctor, he did a wonderful job both times! I was so happy with my first surgery that I came back for the second. When you call for an appointment, it's very quick and they work with you to fit your schedule as best as possible. Everyone loves my results, and Claudia is great. James is wonderful, and very accessible. I never wait too long in the waiting room either. I would gladly recommend this practice to anyone.</Text>< username>

Dr. Mowlavi is a great guy. He did my medicare paid mole removal in a prominent spot on my face that my dermatologist did not want to touch. I think negative reviews, if any, must come from high maintenance people.

If you want a positive experience go with the flow, get an early appointment or you will wait, he is very busy. He is worth waiting for.

I was so happy to have this surgery over with and done so well I do not think there will even be  trace of a scar. Great bedside manner, but he does go with the attitude you bring into the office with you. If you are cranky and angry I don't think you should bring that to his doorstep. There is no harm in appreciating an artist! Sure he has an ego, he's entitled to it and from my experience he is also a kind and pleasant man, as is his staff. I drove 45 min to get to his office and did not mind it because of the results he delivered. Dr. Laguna! Yay!<//text>

Dr. Mowlavi and his staff are incredibly friendly and professional! He is very detail oriented and personalizes his procedures to your needs! I am about a month out from my eyelid surgery and could not be happier! He is extremely caring to all his patients and I’ve never had a doctor treat me the way he does. It’s truly amazing and I would recommend him to everyone!< /Text>

<text>I called this office and spoke with Claudia and made an appointment  and she insisted that I’ll be there on time or will not be seen. I arrived 10 minutes early and they did not even had me down on the schedule even though I had txted them my implant card and full name. It took an hour and half just to be seen and during the time I was waiting in the lobby I witnessed several patients had similar issues and shaking their heads. After leaving we I had scheduled a Skype call to go over my plan which they didn’t even call me to let me know that they were not going make it, and I had to call myself and was informed that the doctor simply thinks that I’m not a good fit. This was all a huge inconvenience and overall a very bad experience with this surgeon. I think the staff were very unprofessional and unorganized and the surgeon did not follow up with me and seemed very careless and impatient.< /text>< Rate>

My surgery experience was phenomenal. I was back at work within 10 days and my follow up appointments have been great. Recovering still at 6 weeks post up  my loving my new body. I greatly recommend Dr. Laguna for any of your cosmetic needs.<//Text>< user>

Dr Mowlavi has been so helpful thought out my surgery experience. He is kind, patient and takes the time to care about you and your cosmetic needs. The front desk staff was very quick and helpful. Kyle has also been amazing at keeping you updated on reminders on dates and information. Very happy coming to see Dr Mowlavi.</review>

<rate>4</rate><review>I want to start by saying that Dr. Mowlavi is an absolute artist and the best at what he does, nobody compares to him and his work. His surgical team was is some of the nicest people they made me feel so comfortable and re assured me I was going to be taken care of the anesthesiologist was super informative and was great even funny. AJ noticed while I was laying on the table could see I was getting scared and nervous he looked down at me and said don’t worry everything is going to be ok, we will take care of you and I immediately felt relief. My nurse was super sweet and took great care of me until I left to the recovery house. The whole vibe is the room was amazing. The after care I received at the recovery house was amazing too, they take great care of you. However my only reason for giving the 4 star rating is the after care i have received has not been good, I have felt like ok we did Your surgery and we are done. I was told by Claudia the patient coordinator that it is my responsibility to reach out them when I am home they leave it to me. I live in Colorado and flew to California to get this done, I shouldn’t have to be the one to reach out to do anything. I was in contact with her for over a year and was never made aware once of possible issues that I could when I come home. And this was nothing cheap. It’s really upsetting and disappointing to feel like no one cares about you after this is over. However if it had not been for  Polly my massage therapist helping me and guiding me since I was in California and since I have been home I would of been lost. Next to the Dr’s work Polly has been one of the best things that came out of the office the care she puts into her massages and willingness to help has made things so much better for me. Every massage I had with her she made me feel better and gave me hope. Even since I have been home for about 2 weeks she has checked  on me and answers all of my questions. I truly thank Dr. Mowlavi for my surgery, he did better than what I would of asked for.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<Response>None< /Response><Text>Where do I even begin with Dr. Mowlavi - from the time that I came to the office, the staff themselves were very knowledgeable and amazing. They were all very professional when it came to the surgical paperwork and Claudia, Dr. Mowlavi’s patient coordinator, was especially helpful in guiding me through the surgical process - she was always very patient in answering all of my pre- and post operative questions. The surgery itself was like a dance party - when I came into the operating room, I was so incredibly comfortable with the entire operating room staff. I felt no anxiety going into the surgery at that moment, which is very rare to feel. When I went into the PACU after surgery, I was surrounded with Dr. Mowlavi’s nursing staff who kept me at ease and made sure I was healing okay. My post-operative experience the days following surgery were amazing as well - I have never seen a surgery center operate so well. Everyone has their place and position and is so accommodating. I highly recommend that each and every patient pursue the post-lymphatic massages offered by Dr. Mowlavi and his massage therapists. Theresa, my massage therapist, has been incredible. She is so gentle and ensured my post-op care was seamless. James, Dr. Mowlavi’s surgical technician, was always very personable and I truly appreciated that so much. I am due back for another surgery with Dr. Mowlavi soon - Dr. Mowlavi will be my Doctor for life! Would highly recommend him to anyone in need of cosmetic surgery.<//Text>< user_name>

I was referred to dr. Mowlavi by Dr. Gaw for my breast lift following a partial mastectomy. This staff and Kyle in particular treated me much care and greeted me with open arms. Dr. Mowlavi made me feel very comfortable and assured me throughout this process. I am about 1 week out and the recover has been painless and the results are as promised. I will come to dr. Mowlavi for any other procedures I may need! I will definitely be referring him to anyone looking for a plastic surgeon.<//text>

<review>I love this office! All of the employees have been extremely sweet and answer any question you may have. Claudia and James are amazingly helpful and I came from out of town so they made the whole trip super easy to plan. Dr. Mowlavi makes a great connection with his patients while also being extremely professional! I felt very comfortable before the surgery because of the constant attention they all provide here. Dr. Mowlavi really held my hand throughout the surgery and made me forget any fears I had prior to the surgery. He is an incredible surgeon and an incredible person! The post-operative care was great and I highly recommend the after-care. The massages are also a life-saver (and it's great that they are included in your fee upfront, some offices don't do that!). I did a ton of research and he was incredibly fair with his pricing and his results are unmatched! I feel much better after every visit to this office and cannot recommend it enough.<//review><gmapID>0x80dce55ba4bac5f5:0x1a63c36560207580</gmapID>< response>

Dr. Mowlavi is incredibly knowledgeable! He made sure I knew exactly what to expect coming into the surgery and I felt confident that he could deliver. The entire office is amazing. I am 1 week out and they are constantly helping with pain management and recovery. Prolly, the massage therapist, is incredible at eliminating swelling and pain. Dr. Mowlavi did an incredible job eliminating all the stubborn fat that I couldn’t get rid of through working out. I can’t wait to hit the gym and watch my muscles pop! Thank you to everyone in this amazing office!< /text>

I am definitely very happy with my results. I am trying to be patient with the slight swelling in the areas of where I had my liposuction and fat grafting done, but it is early and I am already impressed with my results thus far. My experience has been good, well, really, really good. I did not have drains and was really really happy with that obviously. So far, I am loving the results and am beyond excited for 2-3 month mark. Thank you Dr. Mowlavi and thank you to your team!</text>

I came to Dr. Mowlavi for a Full-Body Lift and am amazed by the results! I truly feel like a brand new person and am forever grateful. I am 3 months out and I have loved the entire experience. He and his staff are always available (even on the weekends) and prepared me for everything that was to come. He really makes you feel safe and confident in your decision. His after-care has been amazing and the massages are a MUST. Dr. Mowlavi is an amazing surgeon and really knows what he's doing. I highly recommend him to anyone for body contouring!<//review>

Dr. Mowlavi and his team are so great. Beginning to end has been amazing. Dr. Mowlavi had given me a thorough explanation of what to expect and what I wanted to get done and how he was going to give me the results I wanted. The recovery at the cottage was above amazing and Polly has also been above amazing. They let me exactly what I was going to expect and what was going to happen and everyone has been extremely polite and forthcoming with the whole process. Thank you for all the care along the process and I cannot wait for my full recovery.< /Text>

Dr Mowlavi has been wonderful in helping me in some life changing surgeries.  During the past few weeks I have had two surgeries and after both had some discomfort but really no pain.  Kyle in his office is truly amazing and super helpful he is truly my favorite go to for everything! James has done a great job in removing my staples quickly and with little discomfort.

Looking forward to the next chapter of my life feeling healthier than I have in years thanks to Dr Mowlavi< /Text>

After having multiple cosmetic surgeries over the years in different states Dr. Mowavi and his staff are definitely the most professional experience that I have had.  The after care has been far better than I have experienced as well.  I am only 1 week from my surgery and I have a better body than I have ever had in my younger years! I am very excited!</review>

A week and a half out, pain has mostly subsided, and the massages are a must! Theresa hands are from god, and the staff is amazing. Patiently for results to come through, but so far it looks like I will be thrilled with my results! More reviews to come as the healing takes place!<//review>

I am happy with everything, it was all good. I was content with the whole process, from my first consultation to my operation day, and now with my results. I am happy because the surgery was beautiful and now I want to have my breasts done too. My tummy tuck scar is fading more than I thought it would and my stomach is so tight. Also, you will definitely need someone to help you in the after process, part of the reason it was so good was because my brother was caring for me. Dr. Mowlavi has delivered his excellent results once again, and I am definitely happy with my results! Thank you Dr. Mowlavi and thank you to the team.</Review>

The staff was extremely helpful and replied very quickly to all of my questions. I had a breast augmentation with implants and the results are amazing. Dr. Mowlavi was great at making sure I picked the correct implant size and I couldn't be happier. The post operative experience has been made much more comfortable with their help and medications.<//review>

<text>I had a lower face and necklift done by Dr.Mowlavi last month - I had a lot of excess skin on my neck due to cancer surgery. That being said, I am very satisfied with the outcome of the procedure, and am very grateful to Dr.Mowlavi and his staff for making my pre-and post-operative care seamless and relaxed. His entire office staff was very down to earth and was accommodating. I would highly recommend Dr.Mowlavi to anyone in the future.<//text>< Resp>

He has to be one of the most educated Drs I have had the pleasure of meeting. That says alot if you knew how many doctors and specialists Ive encountered. He is also a perfectionists and it absolutely shows on every body he performs his magic on. Never have I had a doctor who actually responded to a genetics discussion and with knowledge on BII AND BIA-ALCL. Usually a doctor will redirect the convo but not Dr Mowlavi he knew EXACTLY what I was talking about and has even written papers on it. I have NEVER felt so confident in a doctor EVER!! Losing your girlie parts is not an easy thing both physically and psychologically. But now seeing what can be done with the aftermath I am excited for a new healthy lease on life. He is doing so much more than making people look gorgeous. Hes giving people their lives back.</Review></record>

My post op care has been so comforting and I am very excited to see my end result. James and Polly, especially Polly, have been amazing. My massage time has made my recovery helpful, but really the main attraction is what Dr. Mowlavi has done for me. My transformation is beautifully done and I am very happy I committed to Dr. Mowlavi.

My whole experience leading up to getting my surgery done by Dr. Mowlavi was wonderful, start to finish. The whole team is very welcoming and truly helps you in the process of deciding your procedure. Claudia was a dream to work with, alongside the whole team. Special shoutout to James, Dr. Mowlavi’s wonderful surgical technician. One thing I learned is that the recovery process post-surgery is key in having a beautiful outcome. The therapists are amazing, and Theresa is awesome! Dr. Mowlavi is the most amazing plastic surgeon in Southern California, and I would highly recommend him to anyone who desires their dream body!< /Review>

5 stars to Dr. Mowlavi and his care team. I was welcomed straight from the beginning, as I was first nervous looking for a Doctor, but once I met Dr. Mowlavi, I knew it was a great fit. Having a mole removed from my face was definitely a procedure I wanted to go right, and I felt Dr. Mowlavi would deliver. I am so happy with my results and I look great. I have already recommended family and friends to the office, as I know they will be in great hands. Thank you!< /text>

<Review>I loved the staff at Dr. Laguna's office! Everyone was super available and got to me immediately with any questions I had. I was an out of town patient and they were incredibly helpful with scheduling travel time and hotel accommodations as well. First time I saw Dr. Laguna was through instagram and then meeting him in person was amazing. He's super personable and caring and made me feel comfortable the whole way! The surgery went great, the whole OR was supsr professional and the aftercare care at Camilla's cottage was an amazing touch. I could not be happier with this experience and reccomend Dr. Mowlavi to everyone!<//Review>< pictures>

<text>My experience with Dr. Mowlavi and his entire staff was incredible. Having full body surgery was a big decision but I had been thinking about it for so long, and when I met Dr. Mowlavi, I knew he was the surgeon to give me the results I wanted. His work is beautiful and even a week out, I can already feel and see the difference. The recovery process has been alright, but has definitely toned down after a week, so I am excited to be up and running back to normal in a couple weeks. I highly recommend Dr. Mowlavi and his team, from the front to the back office, James, and of course the masseuses. The massages have been amazing and necessary to work and smooth everything out, but I am happy with my results and how smooth and fit I am. Dr. Mowlavi has transformed me and sculpted my body, and I highly recommend him to anyone searching for the top liposuction and BBL surgeon.

Dr. Mowlavi is a miracle worker! I loved Dr. Mowlavi’s energy and personality from the beginning. Thank you so much to the team as well for all of the care during my process! I look incredible and am so excited for my final results in the coming month. Even seeing my results from his post on Instagram had me amazed. I am currently 6 weeks out, and back to working out. My overall recovery so far has been pretty smooth, but I have been eager to going hard at the gym as of recent. I am so happy with my results, from my tummy tuck, liposuction of my front and back side, my breast lift revision, and of course my BBL. I recommend Dr. Mowlavi to all and any looking for top results.</review>

I am totally satisfied with the results of my recent neck and face  lift and upper eyelid lift performed by the highly competent Dr  Arian Mowlavi.  I couldn't have been in better hands!

I had a breast implant revision with Dr. Mowlavi. He was amazing and answered all my questions. He made sure I picked the best size implants and the recovery was very smooth! The office was very prompt and available whenever I needed anything. I will definitely be back for future procedures and recommend Dr. Mowlavi to everyone!< /review>

<review>This doctor is absolutely unprofessional and rude. The pricing of procedures varies each visit. I wanted to do a breast reduction so I made an appointment when he convinced me to do a mommy makeover (breast reduction and tummy tuck) which I later decided not to do both surgeries at the same time. A few months after my consultation--where they followed up with me and asked me to come back. I was informed the price is subject to increase--apparently, the price of two procedures is the same as just one of them. I was told by the patient coordinator to tell the doctor the price I wanted to pay for the procedure, when I attempted to do so the doctor responded by saying verbatim “ I don’t want patients in my office who can’t afford me" and very disrespectfully walked out of exam room. His patient coordinator, Claudia, who was present at the time was even visibly shocked by his behavior, as was my daughter who was also present. I spent the rest of the afternoon feeling literally sick from how bad I was treated. I advise finding a more professional surgeon with better manners.< /review><Rating>1</Rating><Time>1554357534582</Time><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

<review>I felt very secure and confident from the moment that I met Dr. Mowlavi. I always have great instincts when meeting people, and it is safe to say that I was right about Dr. Mowlavi. He was very confident, reassuring, and an exceptionally skilled surgeon who really cares about his patients. I read online reviews from all doctors before choosing Dr. Mowlavi, and I am very pleased that I did. I am thankful to have received care from him and his team. I followed all of his advice for post-operative recovery, and I am now completely back to normal after only one week! Clearly I made the right decision, and I will highly recommend him to anybody who needs a plastic surgeon.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

Dr. Mowlavi is a perfectionist. He did a wonderful job with my body and I am so happy with my results. I had my inner thigh mini lift, j plasma skin tightening all over my body, front and back, and a reverse mini tummy tuck. This was a revision surgery as a previous doctor botched my back, and arms in Irvine with Athenix, and I recommend no one to go there. Thank you to Dr. Mowlavi to fixing me up and making me so happy. I highly recommend Dr. Mowlavi and his team, also Theresa gives me such amazing massages. My post op care has been phenomenal and I am so happy I found the right Doctor.<//review>

I love these guys. Fantastic office, the doctor is very warm and puts you at ease. He doesn't push unnecessary treatments, and really looks out for his patients best interests. I've been getting Botox and fillers from him for a while, his procedures always come out looking natural, I never look over done. I would never hesitate to recommend him!<//Review>

I previously had another surgeon for my past surgery, and I did not like my results. Dr. Mowlavi promised that he would fix my concerns, and he kept his promise! It was a simple process to get me scheduled ASAP, and worked with me on pricing, gave me clear instructions for pre- and post-op, and my results were amazing! I am sooo happy to have made the decision to come here. My follow-up appointments were amazing, and I never had any pain throughout the entire process. Everything was spectacular, and I have recommended him to everyone!</Review>

<Text>I had a benign tumor on my neck that I kept cutting when shaving my face. I had it removed surgically two years previous but it had come back. I came to Dr. Mowlavi and he surprised me and cut if off so I could shave again without hair sticking out. What was especially nice was that the pathologist was in the operating room so he was able to look at the benign tumor right away. I am so stoked about how it looks and show it off to my other doctors who are equally impressed. I'm very happy with the level of assistance with everyone - front office, nurses, people in the back. The doctor is very caring. I would recommend him to anyone who is a little needle shy. He has the touch.</Text><user_name>Mark R Knight< /user_name></record>

<Text>I can say that Dr. Mowalvi has made me very happy. There is a lot of talk about a doctor, let alone a plastic surgeon, needing an artistic eye to be able to do what he does successfully. I did not buy it at first, but I can tell you right now that Dr. Mowlavi has the eye for it. My body is beautiful, proportionate, and I really am happy about my results. I had a tummy tuck, High Definition VASER liposuction of my back and front, and also a BBL. I am so excited for my final results and I definitely have Dr. Mowlavi and his team to thank, from the girls at the front to James, and of course the masseuses. They have made this experience easy and comfortable, and although there is pain right after, I am healing. I am a week out and really starting to feel able again so I am excited for my full recovery in the coming months. I highly recommend, so thank you to the team!</Text>< Pictures>

< Review>
Dr. Mowlavi is amazing! I came to him for my HD Liposuction procedure and could not be happier with the whole experience. Not only are the results amazing, he and his staff have made the whole journey as comfortable as possible. He is extremely caring and takes his time in your consultations to make sure you know everything about your procedure and what the process will entail. Dr. Mowlavi is truly an artist and clearly knows what he's talking about in regards to the ideal body aesthetic. His post-care team including the masseuses have been incredible as well. I will definitely be recommending Dr. Mowlavi to everyone!</Review>

<time>1569437347523<//time><rating>5<//rating><Review>From the start, I was a little nervous about getting surgery, but then I met Dr. Mowlavi at my consultation at his office. He really comforted me and explained all that comes with the surgery. I talked to Claudia as well as the rest of the staff and they were all very welcoming. I had two prior smart lipo procedures that did not give me any of the definition I wanted, they were minimal results, so  I was skeptical. I was happy with my meeting and Dr. Mowlavi’s posted work, so I went ahead and committed.
I was nervous but I went onto the operating table, and when I woke up, I saw the light. I had a changed body to perfection. Dr. Mowlavi showed me my before and after video, after a few of my massages, and I could not believe it. Also, Polly has been an amazing massage therapist, so that has helped as well. I am currently one week out and as expected I am sore with slight discomfort, but i am healing, better and better each day. I would definitely recommend anyone to Dr. Mowlavi for a cosmetic surgery.< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

To be honest, I am really glad it is over, it was a bigger recovery than I expected, but well worth it. The massages are fabulous, and really so helpful. Thank you to Dr. Mowlavi and the wonderful staff, I can tell already it is an improvement and I cannot wait to see the final results for my body. Thank you Dr. Mowlavi! Camilla’s cottage is also so great and I am happy to have spent the night for after care there. It has been a nice experience overall and I am happy to recommend Dr. Mowlavi!< /review>

Dr. Mowlavi and his staff prepare you completely during pre op, with all types of important information for proper healing and recovery, and following surgery the follow ups are timely and pleasant.  Dr. Mowlavi did an amazing job.  Not one of my friends, who didn't know of the surgery, could tell I had just had one.  That was the ultimate compliment.  My skin looks much younger, without looking pulled.  I look natural and definitely 10 years younger. I am very pleased.< /text>< Response>

I had a breast augmentation revision due to some bad scarring from a previous procedure 10 years ago. Dr. Mowlavi performed my implant replacement and now I couldn't be happier, the scarring is completely gone. Post-op care has been great, his entire office including Claudia and James were there every step of the way and calm you down throughout the process!</Review>

I never thought I'd get anything done but I am so glad that I decided to go through with my surgeries because Dr. Mowlavi and his team are AMAZING. I feel like a whole new person. I've had two surgeries with Dr. Laguna (breast aug & lipo) and I couldn't be happier with the results. His bedside manner and his knowledgable staff made the whole process seamless. I cannot recommend him enough to everyone. He really has given me a whole new lease on life. I will never go to another doctor again if I ever decide to get anything else done.< /Text>

I was very happy with Dr. Mowlavi, and I had a great experience at his practice. I was very impressed with his skills as a surgeon, and I found his needling for pain to be extremely painless. Moreover, the stitch removal was also very quick and painless. The staff were very professional as well, and the wait times were very short. James was also present with Dr. Mowlavi, and did a great job during the surgery as well as post-operative care. Overall, I would recommend Dr. Mowlavi to anyone looking for a plastic surgeon!< /text>

I had a face and neck lift done by Dr. Mowlavi and I am beyond speechless at my results! I was able to go back to work just after 8 days! I look great and I can’t stop taking selfies. From my consultation to my post op appointments, Dr. Mowlavi, James, Claudia, and the rest of his staff were beyond wonderful. Dr. Mowlavi is caring, thoughtful, and extremely talented. Him and his staff made sure everything went smoothly before, during, and after my surgery. If you are looking to have plastic surgery done, I wholeheartedly recommend you to do it with Dr. Mowlavi. Now I look young and feel great and it is all thanks to this office!< /Review>

I was referred to Dr. Mowlavi for corrective surgery due to a health issue and was a little scared about the procedure and outcome.  Dr. Mowlavi quickly put me at ease with his kind and reassuring spirit. His need for perfection in all he does is reflected through his amazing work. Each member of his team is every bit as kind and professional as he is making office visits a pleasure.  I'm thankful that I was able to become part of the Mowlavi family and highly recommend Dr. Mowlavi.<//text>

Dr. Mowlavi is OUTSTANDING!  I was searching for a doctor that could complete a liposuction procedure and instead I found an artist to complete a Vaser HD liposuction!  The entire team made the pre-op and more importantly the post-op procedure exceptional.  Claudia explained the steps very clearly and was available each time I had a question and needed an answer.  James & Jason were helpful in making the operation room experience comfortable and Carol with her staff at Camilla's Cottage helped care for me for the first day post surgery.  Finally Polly was exceptional with the continued massages in making me comfortable and look great!  I am ever so grateful for how Dr. Mowlavi and his team made me feel confident about going to the beach again wanting people to look at me.  If you are considering some level of face or body improvement look no more than Dr. Mowlavi.  You will not be disappointed!</Text>

<Text>AMAZING DOCTOR. I had a breast augmentation done by Dr. Mowlavi about a month ago and had an exceptional experience. The Dr. and his team made it easy and the recovery process a breeze. I was very nervous about the procedure, considering I had never gone under general anesthesia, but the team made me feel at ease throughout the process. I could not have asked for better results. Dr. Mowlavi is truly an artist!< /Text><gmapID>0x80dce55ba4bac5f5:0x1a63c36560207580<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Dr. Mowlavi is a fantastic surgeon, and I am very happy and impressed with my results! The office staff were also very professional and made me feel welcomed. The pre-op team was also very professional and made the process much easier. Dr. Mowlavi is very confident, which made me feel very secure working with him. I look forward to other procedures with Dr. Mowlavi in the future!< /Review>

Now into the procedure I had done which was called cooling helium plasma rejuvenation. This was scary to me at first I mean it's my face let's be real. However Dr made me feel so at ease along side his assistants etc so I decided to go for it, I had awful skin I felt. The results compared to the recovery is amazing. It was not easy but the very much worth it I get many compliments and it's only been 6 weeks ..i am excited the results and am willing to share this with anyone who might have questions ..

<Review>Dr.Mowlavi is an amazing surgeon !
He was highly recommended for his refined work.
I am so pleased with the work he performed in correcting my disfigured breast from a previous breast implant procedure.
The sutures are barely noticeable and the final result is so aesthetically perfect that it looks natural.
Thank you Dr. Mowlavi for your skilled hands!< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

On 5/5 I had a Tummy Tuck done and a little fixing to my breasts due to a breast reduction done by another doctor that did a chop job. I was so scared because this was going to be such a big procedure but every time I went into the office Dr. Mowlavi would just get me so hyped I couldn't wait to get it done & see the end results. Now that I'm 4mo out I feel great and can finally wear cuter clothes and feel confidant on how I look instead of always trying to cover up. I know I could do a little more nips & tucks.. but when I do, I will definitely go back to Dr. Mowlavi and staff (James P.A he's awesome)! Thank You.< /text>

Went to Dr Mowlavi for my mommy makeover and he completely transformed my body!  I have done all what I could with exercise and healthy eating but the excess skin was not going anywhere!   Dr. Mowlavi made it happen.  James is awesome.  He has been there for me since the initial consult.  Has made me feel super comfortable and always answers my concerns!  Loving my results!  Couldn't be happier.</Review>

<text>Recently, My wife had been experiencing pain to her upper left breast area.  We began the long trail of solutions through our HMO which ultimately ended us landing with Dr. Mowlavi.  On our initial consult with Dr. M,  I was immediately struck by his bedside manner, and friendliness.   His confidence in solving our problem was very comforting.  We immediately determined that a cosmetic tune up was needed, which ultimately ended up fixing the pain problem with a surgery.   Dr. M was so accommodating to my wife as a patient, that he provided his personal cell phone number to us, and at one point in recovery made a special appointment with us on his day off so we could address some post operative pain.    This is just something that is not heard of in today's medical practice climate.  He took the time to treat her, and did it with compassion.   A ++++

<review>I usually get 25 units of botox and that is more than enough... went for the first time to this place. The doctor recommended 50 units... i still have wrinkles in all the areas he said he would fix... 50 units later and not much change. . Plus i waited for ever. I am going back to my regular doctor... .. bad experience!</review>< pics>

I recently had surgery that I am extremely happy with! I had a breast augmentation, lipo of the inner thighs arms stomach and back and also fat grafting. I am very happy with my breast implants and the sizing the Doctor helped me pick out that was perfect for my body shape. My husband is in the United States Marine Corps and this was a big push for the end of the year Marine Ball where the ladies can get all dolled up and honor their men. I have never felt so beautiful and self confident like I did that night! What I am most happy with is the fat grafting to the buttocks. I now feel so powerful when I slip on jeans or the tight black dress. Dr. Mowlavi is excellent and a perfectionist. He certainly made me feel beautiful and heard all my issues before going into surgery. I am terrified getting up under before surgery but James and Monica looked me in the eyes rubbed my head and said everything will be just fine. I really felt cared for! The rest of the staff has been AWESOME too! Let's just say Dr Mowlavi is my go to! I am a VERY HAPPY patient!<//review>

I had a lower body lift, brachioplasty, breast lift and augmentation after losing 150 lbs. I consulted with 2 other plastic surgeons before I met with him, and they made me feel like just another piece of meat to cut. Dr. Mowlavi has his heart in his practice and it shows! He came highly recommended from one of my best friends who is a operating room surgical nurse assistant, she has worked with all of the cosmetic surgeons in the area, and told me he would be the only one she would ever go to. From my first meeting, I knew he was the only choice for me! Going to Dr. Mowlavi was the best decision I ever made...he truly cares about each and every patient.  He changed my life and I am truly grateful!</text>

He really takes care of you, he really is professional, he is very delicate in everything he does and he does EXACTLY what you tell him to do. He is very welcoming, he wants to help you, I had breast cancer and he helped restore my breasts, and I felt very reassured. I recommend him to everybody to come to see him. The office (both laguna and newport) are really nice.

I also had my nose done, he did a realyl really good job. It looks EXACTLY like i wanted, it looks really natural. I have seem some really horrible nose jobs, but mine came out really professional and I am very happy!<//review>

I'm thankful my primary care doctor referred me to Dr. Molavi for a breast reduction.
The surgery helped me to have more movement & flexibility in my neck which was desperately needed.  I can now drive and look to the left without having to turn my whole body to see traffic. And I feel more comfortable in my skin & more open.
Dr. Molavi treats you like you're part of his family. He's very thorough, kind & even though he is very busy, will take the time to answer all your questions.
I recommend him highly for any cosmetic surgery you may need!
Thank You Dr. Molavi!< /review>

Dr. Mowlavi and his entire team are amazing! From when I first arrived in his office the staff was very welcoming and I felt like I was going to be in good hands. Dr. Mowlavi spent time with me to talk about exactly what I wanted and how I wanted it to look. It was really refreshing to have a doctor who really cared. He has a great eye and will offer exactly what is appropriate for you. In my case I wanted Botox and he recommended it in the areas that would make me look most natural and it turned out great. I will be going back. Thank you Dr. Mowlavi!< /Text>

<Review>My experience with Dr. Mowlavi, caring for my mother, was very positive.  He skillfully removed cancer and reconstructed facial and scalp areas with amazing results. He treats us like family and has our full trust in his care.  Dr. Mowlavi takes time to answer questions and explain things, reassuring and supportive.  I highly recommend Dr. Mowlavi to anyone in need of plastic surgery.< /Review>< gmapID>

<name>Deborah O'Shea<//name><Review>I am a 56-year-old woman with 1 child who I breast fed, 34 C, no volume. I am fit and work out about 4-5 days a week.  I found Dr. Mowlavi on Real Self while researching breast augmentation.  I had already been on several consultations with doctors wanting to perform the surgery in different ways, it was a bit confusing.  I scheduled a consult and upon arriving I found the office to be beautiful and clean, the office staff was very nice and offered me something to drink while I waited.  Dr. M came in and introduced himself, he is so nice and personable, we talked for a little bit about what I was looking for and I was adamant about not getting a breast lift. Once he examined me, he suggested I get the lift and didn’t think I would be happy with only implants as my breasts would still be saggy only larger.  My concern was the scaring, he showed me pictures and assured me, with his technique, the scars would be minimal and not very visible. The quote I received with the lift, was the same price the other doctors gave for just the augmentation.  We also talked about my stomach, it was flat but the skin was saggy, for just a little bit more money, he suggested a mini tummy tuck.

Because he made me feel so comfortable, I made the decision to go with him.  We decided on 405 cc’s which puts me now at about a 34 D.  It’s been a little over a year and I can’t tell you how happy I am with his work.  My breasts look very natural, no one would know I had implants.  The scaring is so minimal and the way he placed my breasts, you can’t even see the scars head on, no scaring at all, around my areola.  My stomach is flat, I feel comfortable wearing a bikini and I look amazing!

I just went back last week as I had some fat on the inside of my knees that I just couldn’t get rid of, he gave me a great price on liposuction so I scheduled for the following week. It only took about 25 minutes and the fat is gone.  It’s been a week and I barely have any bruising…they look amazing and they are even still a bit swollen.

I don’t typically write many reviews but felt compelled to do so for Dr. Mowlavi as he is such an amazing doctor and just an all-around nice person.  When I’m ready for that face lift, I’ll be going back!<//Review><Time>1501175601156</Time><userid>107079380438058759266</userid></record></dataset><record>

BUTT IMPLANT REVIEW: IF YOU WANT TO HAVE LIKE THAT PERFECT HOURGLASS FIGURE DR. MOWLAVI IS THE DOCTOR TO GO TO. Before I found Dr. Mowlavi I had actually gone to another doctor he was very unprofessional and rude. THANK GOODNESS I found this doctor. Not only was I able to get my confidence up but I was also able to finance my own surgery and pay it all by myself. I got the implants instead of the fat transfer because I did not have enough fat to give me the volume that I wanted if this is you then go to Dr. Mowlavi. I actually went to his location in Laguna Beach and have nothing but good things to say about him and his staff they treated me like if I was family and I felt VERY SAFE under their care. Thank YOU GUYS FOR EVERYTHING. Dr. Mowlavi is truly an artist :) If your still unsure about this procedure just go to a consultation he is very friendly and sweet. Always willing to answer any questions and concerns. Special Thank you to Claudia and James for all the support as well through out the whole process.</Review>

Dr Mowlavi performed a lift as well as a smaller implant exchange, and I could not be happier with the results!! They are EXACTLY what I wanted. While I was unsure about which size implant I should go with, Dr Mowlavi assured me he would make me look proportionate to my body type, and he did exactly that. His patient care coordinator Claudia was absolutely wonderful as well! She provided me with her personal cell phone for any and questions, concerns, etc. I reached out to her multiple times, and got a response within the hour. If for some reason she could not, she made sure one of the staff got in touch ASAP. Like most people, I was quite nervous, but she made me feel so much better! At times we did have to wait a tad longer than scheduled appointment time, however I actually found this reassuring. He has many patients who trust him and his team, and that to me is MUCH more important. I will DEFINITELY recommend Dr Mowlavi to anyone looking to make any cosmetic changes. :)<//Review>

<text>From the first time we walked in Dr Mowlavi the staff treat you like family and with dignity, they dont over talk you. I remember for my first surgery he stroked my arm when I went to sleep, he was very comforting and has fantastic bed side manner. When i was in a wheel chair he was one of the few doctors who actually talked to ME and not above me to my family instead. After I had a gastric bypas I lost 500 lbs and I have had multiple surgeries to remove my excess skin including a panniculetomy, and he removed 4.5 lbs off of each side of my thighs. I am going to have my arms done and my inner thighs.

I would highly reccomend him to anyone. He doesnt treat you like a patient, he treats you like family</text>< Pictures>

< Review>
Dr. Mowlavi has never disappointed. The results of procedures have been always complete. For my skin cancer removal I have never has to revisit with additional appointment. The resident pathologist who immediately performs and finds lab results, gives extra confidence in the processes Dr. Mowlavi uses. There was one procedure that sometimes work for keloids, were reduced, but I was particularly sensitive and he didn't want do do more injections. The result is the keloids are much flatter.

I want you to consider the following:

Today I was in for a Melanoma extraction of tissue on my right fore arm. Dr. Mowlavi's surgical procedure was, except for a slight sting of the needle. I didn't feel the process at all. The after care with staff assisting is friendly and competent. I'm honored to be asked to write about my experience.< /Review>

<Text>I have always had wonderful experiences with Dr. Mowlavi and his staff. I had a reconstruction after a bad construction many years ago after going through breast cancer. After Dr Mowlavi reconstructed my right breast and added an implant to my left breast, I now have two very even breasts and a cleavage. I can definetely recommend Dr. Mowlavi to anyone needing and wanting cosmetic surgery 100%.</Text><user>115438586640897669739< /user>< user_name>

This was a total circus.  My friend and I bought a voucher on Living Social for Botox for 20 units.  I knew I would need more and inquired.  The receptionist told us his cash price per unit.  It was really good.  Upon arrival at the office, we had to park down the street because the lots were so full at this one office building.  The reception area was packed.  Should have been a good sign, right? Wrong.  Not only did we wait for about 30 minutes for our appointment (only the doctor's time is valuable), then we were called into the treatment room and waited some more.  When he came in, we had a couple of questions and he tried to sell us a lot of other things.  "Try it for free" he says.  Then he disappears again and goes on to other patients.  He also said his cash price was more than we were originally told. But I still asked for 55 units based on HIS assessment.  This is 15 more than I usually get.  After another hour or so, we got our botox, paid and left.
A month and a half later, I have deep wrinkles in my foreheard. (It should last at least 6 months).  I called to tell them it didn't work correctly, that he maybe watered it down too much. He said that I metabolized it too much so it was my fault.  hmmmm....I've been getting Botox for over 10 years and suddenly, with my slowing metabolism now that I'm over 50, I'm processing Botox differently.  Interesting.  He refused to fix it.  It probably would have taken 10 units.
This doctor acts really nice, but is just a scam artist.  I would never trust him to touch my face again.  BE WARNED!< /text>

<review>Dr. Mowlavi - I had a wonderful experience! The thing I really liked about him is that he wasn't a stick in the mud, sometimes doctors seem like they don't have time to be personal with the patient, but Dr. Mowlavi was personal, friendly, generous and down to earth with me. That is what I really enjoyed about him, he made me feel very comfortable, and I really enjoyed, and I am very happy that he is my surgeon.

As far as my procedure is concerned I feel that before I had the procedure Claudia and Erika made me feel really comfortable and answered all my questions. They were always there to answer my questions before my procedure. When I was preparing for my procedure I was really nervous but the Staff at Orange Coast Memorial Hospital was really great too. The anesthesiologist and nurse were really awesome. When they took me in for the procedure the anesthesiologist really did her job, all I remember is looking up at the ceiling and that was it, I was in the recovery room all done. It was a little painful in the recovery room, Nurse Sae was awesome and took care of the pain. I felt good.

After my surgery when I was bandaged up I felt good. My pain tolerance is high, I did pretty good with it, and took a few of my pain pills. After less than a week I was no longer in pain, didn't have to take any pills, and I was very satisfied.

In my post operative appointment they changed all my bandages and everything and I am VERY VERY satisfied. I am happy with my new figure and the new me! I feel so light, almost 100lbs lighter! I can't wait to wear my cute Victoria Secret bras (That I have never been ever to wear before!!!).

Dr. Mowlavi is awesome and fantastic. He has made me feel really good at my age. I am an older woman, but I feel very very young. I would definitely refer all my friends to Dr. Mowlavi for their breast surgeries, tummy tucks and cosmetic procedures. His wife is  a very luck woman!!.<//review>< Pictures>

My kids and I ran across some foster families that were at a Petsmart with their greyhounds.  Everyone was so nice and passionate about the dogs and so willing to share their experiences with us.   One of the volunteers invited us to a retirement day event in January 2020.  It was the most amazing thing to witness.  The entire staff is professional, down-to-business, and so caring of these amazing dogs.  The dogs were brought directly from the track and given such care and love.  We are excited to foster and adopt in the near future.  Thank you fast friends for a life-changing experience.<//Review>

<Review>Rescue and adoption is always great. BUT THIS ORGANIZATION HAS NOTHING AGAINS DOG RACING. EVEN THOUGH ONE OF THE DOGS UP FOR ADOPTION HAD A BROKEN LEG FROM THE RACE. any person that knows about the cruelty behind dog races knows how cruel this practice is. Fast friends 'rescue' is just a money making business who dies not pay taxes because they are filing under a 501c non profit. They are not against dog racing since that's how they run their adoptions. They profit from the dogs they go and pick up from race tracks. Shame on them.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

This is a stunning wedding venue with large picture windows letting in the gorgeous views of the golf course.
The bridal suite is beyond spacious!
We are excited to see the fall colors adorn this property next year when our daughter marries her best friend 👰‍♀️ ❤ 🤵🥂< /Text>

< Review>
One of the most well manicured courses I have played! The greens were fast and very challenging, but still fun. The elevation change between some of the holes gives the course a more intimate feel. The food is fabulous and the drinks keep flowing. I was here for a charity tournament, so that may havr been the reason for all the food and drinks!< /Review>

Went here for a wedding which was absolutely beautiful. The rolling foothills provided an amazing backdrop. Fantastic facilities and bar. Highly recommend for any large events.<//Text>

<rate>5<//rate><text>What a beautiful venue. My now wife and I got married here in October and we cannot say enough good things about Catta Verdera and their staff.

When picking a venue we felt it was important to pick a place that we connected with. We also felt it was important to connect with the people we would be working with. Jim and Christina were fantastic people. We worked mostly with Christina and she was just so amazing throughout the entire process. She explained everything very well, even multiple times if we forgot and was so pleasant the entire time.

The bride and groom suites were outstanding! The bridal suite is ENORMOUS and everything a bride could want for getting ready. They had staff on hand to get drinks and food at both suites. The groom’s suite is about just what you would expect, a nice room, not overly sized with a bathroom (no shower) and nice furniture with a nice patio and good places nearby to take photos.

They have a beautiful outdoor ceremony area and picturesque landscapes to back it up. We were originally supposed to have an outdoor ceremony and indoor reception. Our plans changed a few hours before the ceremony was supposed to start due to the forecasted rain. The decision to move the ceremony inside was made and it was beautiful. We never imagined the ceremony inside and no one would have ever guessed that it was not supposed to be that way from the beginning. The way they set up the room you almost wouldn't know that it was also the reception area. Their team did a great job getting everything set up for the ceremony and broken down and ready for the reception.

The food was OUTSTANDING. Not even our pickiest guest had anything bad to say. They also worked with us during the planning process to accommodate our guests with food allergies.

We had an amazing wedding day, their staff made the rain a non-factor for us and took care of everything. Most people think when something like that happens it's a disaster but both of us felt like everything went on without the notion of a hiccup. If amazing food and flawless landscape is important to you in finding your perfect venue we would highly recommend Catta Verdera.<//text>< pics>

I have to give these guys kudos! I order pizza with them quite often (weekly) and only ONCE did I have an issue but when I spoke with the store they immediately fixed the issue, listened to my concerns, and anymore that’s hard to find with businesses. You guys are awesome from the kitchen, to the customer service, to delivery, quality, time efficient, and customer satisfaction!! Which leads me to believe great management as well!! Thanks for being my top choice especially in this time of Crisis. 👏👏
You all deserve to know that you’re doing awesome</review>

Ordered special " 2 Medium 1 topping pizzas for $11.49 over the phone and was given a 15 min time to make. Arrived 14 min later, they had order under different name, didn't have me under the special i ordered (instead 2 large for $28.29) and when corrected they were going to have me wait 10 mins which i raised concern, manager then just gave me the large they originally made by mistake...<//Text>

So I ordered 45 minutes ago, I call the store and she tells me her driver will not be back from deliveries for another 20 minutes and if this is a problem to cancel the order. I CANCELED. If this is the way Dominos treats its "valued customers" they should be out of business soon> I AM DONE WITH DOGIMOS.< /text>

I ordered a pizza over two hours ago and still haven't received anything. I called an hour and thirty minutes after making the order to see what had happened. The employee that answered the phone told me he has to wait for the delivery driver to come back, and they might have to redo my order. I still don't know would caused them to lose my order half way of them delivering it. This is the second time having a similar experience with this Domino's, so I thought customer feedback is do. I don't even know what I can recommend improvement on, scene nobody called me back to let me know what happened. I didn't even receive a refund yet. Maybe hire more people, that's the nicest way I can put it.</review>

The team is beyond outstanding with service & friendliness. The generosity of extra touches especially extra pizza, care, & friendliness really keeps us eager on spreading good word about this specific store, which we will definitely continue to keep up. I've been to many Domino's & other fast pizza places, but this one tops it all for us thanks to their love & always-warming thoughtfulness. The pizza is already delicious while the service is beyond the realm. Thank you greatly, Domino's Team!<//text>

Nice to see a fast food pizza place with employees that actually care and the pizza is good. We still order from them.

<Review>Had my pizza ready driver was on the way.
And suddetly they dont want to deliver my pizza.
You CANNOT reason with this people. So i called 3 other stores near by to see if they could solve my issue and they directed me back to them again said they had to deliver it becuase im in their zone..they apologize for the inconvenience. So i call this people again and still refuse to deliver. She did not care she was in a bad mood and i have no food to eat. Now i must wait 3 days to get my money.
Questions is..  What happends to the already made pizza??... Does it go to waste? I mean all this people hungry.. I dont know all i really know is I AM NEVER GOING TO ORDER FROM THIS PLACE AGAIN.  AND BY THE WAY I CANNOT POST A CLAIM..< /Review>< Pics>

Just when you think fast- food pizza can't be any good... I was more than pleasantly surprised😃
The crust wasn't dough-y, enough amount of sauce so the pizza wasn't dry & sauce was flavorful (but not so much you couldn't taste the toppings).
I had my reservations about going back to Domino's Pizza after years back being turned off. I'm  glad I gave them another chance.
After just having surgery, they were so kind to offer to walk me and my pizza to my car.
Great recovery food, terrific employees and a renewed love of inexpensive pizza!</Text>

(My wife) tried to call and make an order over the phone using the $5.99 items. The associate said I ordered 9 items, but I only ordered 7, when I changed the toppings on a pizza he added a whole new pizza instead of just changing the toppings. Then said that'll be $70., I said at $6 /piece x's 7 should come up to $42 plus delivery and taxes not $70. I got so frustrated I was home by the time I started having him repeat the order, I said forget it cancel the order and I'll do it online so its correct. After we ordered online and added extra sauces and an additional 8th item it was $52 which is less then $70.. DON"T CALL, ORDER ONLINE PEOPLE TO MAKE SURE YOUR ORDERS CORRECT.< /text>

<text>UPDATE: ITS STILL TRUE! Bad experience here. Pizza was COLD. And the "insurance" was a joke, bc they never fixed it, I didnt get my money back, and I HIGHLY suggest you go to a different Dominos, bc this one reeks. How it got the rating it did is mindboggling< /text>< Pics>

Wow... I am so disappointed I know they can do better. The pizza that I ordered the other day for my sisters and I came out burnt at the bottom and completely uncooked and doughy at the top. Hopefully the next one. The cinnamon twists came out perfectly done and delicious so I guess it evened itself out a little bit.<//Review>

<Name>Sean Hernandez< /Name><review>Decent pizza at decent prices. New online feature allows you to monitor the progress of your order from placing to prep to oven to box. The same tracker is on a screen when you enter the store. Employees never seem too busy and are usually attentive. I always order online for in-store pick-up. After I order, I leave my house, get to the store, walk in, pay, and leave with my pizza. I've rarely had to wait when ordering this way.< /review><user>102080729825384111806<//user><Rating>4</Rating></record></dataset><record>

If I could give no stars, I would. My boyfriend ordered online and it usually takes 20 minutes for us to get our food, we never had a problem before.... but today, we ordered and we wondered why it took 40 minutes, we call and the man that answered the phone HUNG UP on my boyfriend for questioning where it was, we call again and the manager starts to be really rude toward us, and they were very unprofessional. This store shouldn't be here, or they need to find better employees to represent their store.<//review>

We order delivery from the $5.99 menu and have never been disappointed.  The pasta and sandwiches are surprisingly very tasty. Audryia is the cook you want.
Keep it up.</review>

<text>I love Domino's but I never eat it because its far from me. I eat it when I go to South Lake Tahoe, but I cant wait when its local! I saw the sign go up and I've been at the edge of my seat waiting. Its around the corner from my house! .9 miles!! There is lots of college kids and family's living by the American River so I hope you guys do excellent in this location. Pizza places have tried but they are inconstant and expensive so you guys have a big edge. Great place to set up and I'm happy you are here. Cant wait to order!</text><gmap_id>0x809adcbcdf349ff9:0x468831defb2a10a<//gmap_id><name>dave thomas</name><Date>1458634442507<//Date><response>None</response><user>111540613780910159929< /user></record>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><Text>Dominos has done a good gob of turning it reputation around. The service was good, the pizza is good, but when I was growing up it was rude to ask for a tip. It was something the patron decided. Now there are tip jars everywhere, and the reciet has it on the front of the reciet. Not ever job has to have a tip. The job I do, if I asked for a reciet I would be fired. Needless to say I don't like every job out there having their hands out. Obviously business are not paying their help well and expect their patrons to give tips so their employees stay happy.

Usually great, however I just walked over to get a simple order of cinnamon twists and knowing that online it said they close at 11PM, I knew I would be there before then. When I got there it was still before 11 and the open sign was lit, however I was heavily disappointed to find the door locked and the employees sitting on their phones. Furthermore, the door even said that the store was to be open until 12AM on weekdays. This is hard for me to say but I really am upset with the store being closed so early despite no indication that they would.</text>

Do pick up, not delivery. They always forget sauce which you have to pay for so it's kind of annoying. It's super cheap and filling so, totally worth the price. Better quality than other chain pizza places.< /Review>

Just left Dominos. Ordered $35.96 worth of pizzas. Husband tried to pay with $50 bill. 23yr old manager Brian told us to "F--- off and get out of his store." When we asked why he responded so angrily since we had done nor said anything to merit his behaviour, he simply continued cursing at us. Whoever made this rude, irresponsible, ill-mannered individual a manager needs to seriously rethink their decision. Brian needs to be fired immediately.< /Text>

Used to work here as a delivery driver. Quit after a couple weeks cuz I got tired of seeing the prep cooks prep after using their phones and not wash their hands after ward. They'd often bring each other gifts and not include me. They would even act inappropriately with one another (i.e. slapping butts of other crew members) The breaking point was when a 'manager' had the audacity to reprimand me for saying a cuss word to myself and began yelling at me like a child. The owner never did anything about it, but instead excused her behavior.
I should sued because I'm disabled and the staff treated me unfairly daily.</Text>

I honestly wouldn’t even give this place 1 star!!! I’ve ordered 2 times this week and never get the side sauces I pay for.. The first time I let it go tonight I call and Anna says I have to wait 30-45 minuets to have them sent... Anna is horrible and doesn’t know how to take care of customers ... It’s good because after tonight Dominoes you will no longer get my money!!!</text>

I ordered my pizza with no sauce due to me being allergic to the sauce. I called once I got my pizza and I took a bite out of my pizza and there was sauce. The person I talked to then proceeded to tell me how I was wrong and there was no sauce. I finally got to the point where I just wanted to eat with my family and have dinner and had to beg him to bring me a new pizza. He was very rude and inconsiderate to my allergy. I will never be ordering pizza from here anymore due to his aditude.< /Text>

<text>I placed an online order which allows you to watch the progress of your food being made. I watched the progress switch from 'your pizza is being prepared' to 'your pizza is in the oven' to 'thank you for picking up your order' all while sitting at home. So I told my husband I guess the food is ready, let's go pick it up. We only live about 4-5 minutes drive away so it would still be hot when we arrived. Well we walked in, it took them a few minutes to acknowledge us and when we asked about our pizza we were told it was "still being prepared, it was gonna be a few minutes." Hmm? I guess that have to keep the times cut down for corporate and just said the order was ready online when it was nowhere near ready. It was another 10 minutes of waiting before we got our food. And it wasn't very tasty once we got it home, very greasy (not exaggerating) and not very flavorful. Never ordering from here again.<//text>< user>

And When We Asked For Crushed Peppers And Parmesan Packets, We Were Told It'd Be An Additional $3.00. That Felt Cheap And Insulting. We Had Just Spent Over $20 On A Small Pizza And This Pizza Restaurant Couldn't Spare A Dash Of Crush Pepper And A Sprinkle Of Powdered Cheese For It's Patrons... Please.
Worst Yet, When We Asked For Salt And Pepper We Were Told That They Don't Carry That At The Restaurant... Seriously! What Kind Of Restaurant Is This? We Obviously Didn't Feel Welcomed To Eat Our Food There, Eventhough Our Food Was HOT AND TASTY.
It Was A Sad Experience. My Companion Is A Pizza Hut Fan. It Was My Idea To Go To Dominos. I Felt Bad.

Dominos Needs To Offer A More Welcoming Restaurant Experience. That Means Stacking Their Tables Properly And Training Their Staff To Work In A Dominos' Pizza Restaurant Instead Of A Dominos' Pizza Factory.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

Dominos has been stepping their game up in the last few years, and new rwmodled stores are a great look. Staff was friendly and swift, digital pickup board on the wall showing status of your pizza is two thumbs up.< /Text>

Did a carry out at about 630pm yesterday.Pepper packets are $1 said the delivery driver.They staff said they dont have pepper packets and offer to sale me seasoning shakers. I DONT WANT A SHAKER. They couldnt find the napkins. They asked the customer before if he paid and he said yeah and walked out, but they looked me up in the system to ensure I paid. The guy that answered the phone was really cool and did a great job but his team sucks.<//Text>

Restroom is more offensive smell wise than the worst truck stop I've ever been to.  After you are required to touch the no chip reader to sign, you need a key attached to a huge spoon to get into the bathroom that is 5 feet from the counter.  Sad< /text>

<time>1538612609957<//time><Text>My pizza took an hour to be delivered from the time I ordered it even though the store is literally down the street my food was barely warm and one of my pizzas had NO sauce and NO pepperoni although I asked for light sauce and light pepperoni I called the store to let them know a pizza that was delivered was wrong and the man who answered the phone was very unprofessional and rude he told me that light sauce means no sauce which didn’t make any sense so I asked to speak to a manager and he said he was the manager and he refused to give me his name stating he can’t give out that information extremely dissatisfied with the service at this store!< /Text>< GmapID>

Was referred through employer benefits program. They aren't even based in my state! They talk a good talk and make many unkept promises. Once they get your money, you won't hear from them again. The cost is ridiculously astronomical. Paid 3-4 times more with "discount" than if I hired my own attorney. They are just a middle man. They appointed a local attorney who I never met. He sent two different attorneys to my two hearings. They took the easy way out rather than fighting the charges as they said they'd do. Do your research and hire your own local attorney.</Text>

< Review>
I worked with Chyanna and Laurence, they both were fantastic. I had some serious anxiety about my case and they both made sure to make me feel at ease through the entire process, they actually cared. I trusted them with my future and they definitely took care of me. I called about 20 different lawyers and none of them compared to these guys. Very professional and knowledgeable.</Review>

<Text>I saddens me that i have to give this firm even 1 star. I feel i am being too generous. Fact is, save your money. These "people" don't care about you or what you have to do just to pay them. They just want your money. Then they ignore you. Lines like "oh she's in a meeting" or other nonsense.
So to all the the people who have been ripped off by this firm i feel your pain. To those who are planning to hire them please save your money.</Text>< Pictures>

He was as advertised. Knowledgeable and confident Mike convinced the court to correctly have the case dismissed. I wished it could have went a little quicker but it wasn't because of lack of preparation on his part. I couldn't be more impressed with Mike's energy and optimistic attitude. He kept me from becoming disillusioned and depressed as the State dragged its feet. The results were beyond expectations. Thank you falls short of my feeling of gratitude!

<text>I recently got in touch with this law firm through LegalShield, I needed help getting expunction or non-disclosure for my criminal record. When I spoke about it to Jason, he said he was very confident that we will be able to get this done, and sounded very optimistic. I later found out that I am not even eligible for non-disclosure or expunction until another year from now. And I had to look that up myself on Google and confirm that was true after I already paid almost $2000. Why was I doing my lawyers job? Why didn’t he ask me specific questions about my case before promising me he would be able to do it, it has now been over a month and the refund I was promised has still not been given to me. Jason is now avoiding my calls and their receptionist is also very rude and unprofessional. If I am not refunded my money I will be forced to contact the state bar.</text>< Pics>

Lina Helou is one of the best people I have ever spoken to.  Her kindness, way of putting legal gargon into everyday known words and her gentle, calm demeanor made me feel more comfortable in understanding the law and what was going to happen in our case.  I recommend speaking to her and using this law firm for your legal matters.   Lina is top notch in my opinion and very professional.< /Text>

<text>The justice system isn't ways fair; however, with Shannon Dorvall by your side, your result can be positive. Shannon fought for a family member of mine to get felony charges reduced to a misdemeanor. Today, I am ever so grateful as that family member was released from probation early, had his case dismissed and the case records sealed. I highly recommend Imhoff & Associstes and, specifically, Shannon Dorvall for fighting for my family, challenging the system, and sticking with us for the last year. 2020 is gonna be brighter because of you!< /text><pics>None</pics><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

Imhoff & Associates were recommended through my employers benefits program. I spoke with them regarding my case and they quickly had someone available to get started. The attorney handled our case masterfully! I have nothing but a huge debt of gratitude for our Atty. Mr. Larry Vandersnick and the whole Imhoff & Associates team. I will forever be grateful that I chose you guys to handle our case.<//Text>

I found Imhoff & Associates through the employee assistance program at my workplace...Tara Shams and I spoke many times and she was both knowledgeable and caring about my situation.  I ended hiring another law firm due to financial limitations, but I would recommend Imhoff & Associates to anybody needing aggressive and responsive representation for their case.  Very professional!< /Text>

<text>I am not even sure where to begin with this review. I truly wish I had done my research before moving forward with this firm.

I needed an attorney last year due to a traffic violation that I received. My government employer recommended that I take advantage of our employee benefits legal services and use Imhoff & Associates. I was reluctant at first due to being unfamiliar with this firm and being a new employee at the time, but also needed quick representation. I went ahead and paid a lot of money after a long and convincing phone call with the case manager, Sonia.

At first everything sounded reassuring. I was located in Fort Lauderdale, Florida and was told multiple times by Sonia, the case manager, that I would have a local attorney represent me- this was not the case at all! I was contacted via phone call by an attorney who lived 3 hours north of me outside of Orlando. This should have been my first red flag.

I wanted nothing more than reassurance and communication. I received the total opposite. The attorney assigned to me failed to return my phone calls, texts, and e-mails except for when she only needed a direct answer from me regarding my decision to go to trial or not. Aside from anything else, forget it, she was a ghost! Each time I actually got a response from her she would have an excuse as to why she was unavailable for so many weeks at a time (7-week vacation, spending time with family, etc., and etc.).

It was both apparent and obvious that the attorney was one of those "get my money and we'll just plea" type of lawyers. I never even got to meet my attorney until the day we went to court (6 months later). It was like having a legal ghost represent me. I was both embarrassed and just utterly let down. My friends and family kept telling me to cut my ties and find better representation, but me being me, I kept telling myself things would get better, but they never did. They only got worse.

I felt not only cornered into an absolutely lousy plea deal, but bewildered at the fact that my attorney was so apathetic during all of this. Discussing the facts, weighing options, and informing me of what was happening was at the bare bones minimum.

Three months into the case, I had relocated out of state and my attorney was well aware of this and my new address.

The icing on the cake came when my attorney contacted me to inform me that my court date was in 48 hours and that I needed to be back in Florida. As you can imagine I was in absolute shock and distress! Again, there was no forward communication and I hadn't heard from her in over a month. It was a nightmare trying to find a flight and make it back to Florida.

I tried reaching out to voice my concerns to Imhoff & Associates regarding the poor representation I was receiving, but did they return my calls? Nope! I received a phone call twice from them during the process from one of their representatives, but once I began to tell the lady my situation she says "Oh, I’m so sorry, let me connect you to your attorney."- and did she answer? Of course not. I also requested that the case manager, Sonia, contact me immediately. She never did.

I've wrote this ordeal off as one of those life lessons where you get what you pay for and no matter how bad things may seem in the beginning, you should be smart and do your homework when looking for an experienced, aggressive, and communicative lawyer to help you. I don't want anyone else to have to go through what I have, so if I can prevent someone from utilizing services from this firm, I will at least have something to take away from this.

I can only hope now that Imhoff and Associates will at least due diligence and refund me a portion of what I have paid for the hassle, stress, and frustration I've had to endure by using their services.

At the end of the day, Imhoff and Associates will assign you an attorney, inform you that all of their attorneys have at least 15 year’s experience, and tell you all the things that you want to hear during a vulnerable time but, be aware...once you cut that check your history!< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2bb60d0d0d531:0x59753b80a1d1a8ce< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I contacted Imhoff to help me expunge an old case. The quote I was given was over $1000 more than law firms in my area so I negotiated with Imhoff and they took off $1000. I was supposed to get my $1000 refunded at the end of December yet it never came. The attorney they contracted with in my area was great and found that my case was not on record. I text my case manager Sean Street, called his cell phone and the office (over a period of 3 weeks). He finally answered and said he would call me back that afternoon about a refund. He never called me and didn’t respond to my attempts to reach him (calls, text, email). I get a call from the Jill Del Toro (finance person) 2 weeks later who said I’d get my $1000 refund (the original adjustment to the price). She had no info about a refund of any of the $2600 I paid. At this point I had been trying to reach Sean for over a month with zero calls to me. I finally called the office and asked to speak with Sean’s manager. They transferred me to SEAN. He said he didn’t call me bc he knew the finance person called me . I let him know it was only about the $1000 I was owed for almost 2 months. He said he would check with his manager about a refund of some of my $2600 and he would call me that afternoon and yet again did not call me back. I text him 2 days later asking if he was planning to call me. No response. I called 5 days later and asked to speak with the manager and said “do not transfer me to Sean”. The lady asked me to tell her what was going on. I told her the story and she said she was going to talk to Sean. She put me on hold and....transferred me directly to Sean. Sean picked up and immediately said I was going to get a refund. I told him that his failure to return my calls/texts/emails was unacceptable and he apologized. I asked how much of a refund I was getting and he said he didn’t know but “almost everything”. He said someone would be reaching out to me from finance. This didn’t happen after a week. I reached out to the finance person myself. She apologized profusely for my experience and agreed to call me the next day after she spoke to her boss. NO CALL BACK and it’s been over a week. I’ve sent an email and left a voicemail. I’m actually wondering if this is a real business or someone operating a scam out of their basement.< /review>

When an infraction seemed somewhat minor results in a possible 2-20 year sentence it’s time find an attorney.  Through our company insurance were lucky to locate IMHOFF and Associates and a lawyer was selected to review the charges.  Gene informed us of the seriousness of the four (4) charges and worked diligently to get three (3) charges dropped and the final charge resulted in a “deferred adjudication”; our family couldn’t be happier.  I would recommend the law firm and Gene to anyone needing help with criminal law problems.< /Review>< pics>

We would like to assure you that our skilled Case Managers and front desk staff are trained on what information to provide to clients when they call.   We’re normally known for our exceptional attention to detail, and we regret that we missed the mark.\nIf given the opportunity we would like to amicably work towards regaining your trust through our quality of service.  Please contact myself, Vincent Imhoff, Managing Director at 1-800-887-0000, to further discuss the specifics of your experience .'}< /response>< gmap_id>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><Review>This is the biggest crock of a law firm if I've ever seen one.  They have a relatively convincing sales pitch where the prices are, at a minimum, 4x what it would cost you to go to a local attorney, then claim they give you a "25% discount"--which is still at least 3x as much as you'd spend for the same service from a local attorney.

What REALLY rubbed me the wrong way with them, other than their ridiculous prices, was how nice they were when they were trying to get my business.  As soon as they were paid, all of a sudden they were unreachable (i.e. always in 'meetings', 'left for the day', etc.) and the front desk flunkies will tell you anything to keep you from speaking to an actual attorney.  Plus, the paralegal Sonia Stein routinely gives false information about the legal process--again, trying to get your business.  Once they get your money, they literally don't care about you or your case anymore--even when they assign you an incompetent attorney.

This place is nothing but a big marketing scheme. STAY AWAY.</Review>< user>

The attorney my sister hired from Imhoff never showed up in court, for 12 successive court dates! The judge finally told her to get a new lawyer.</text>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Text>ATTENTION AND BEWARE IMHOFF AND ASSOCIATES are THIEVES! They do not live up to their mission statement, not even close.  They talk a good talk at first and make you believe they have the best attorneys available to them anywhere in the United States that will fight for you.  They make promises they do not intend to uphold. Once they have your money you are basically on your own.  I notified Imhoff and Associates case manager, Mr. KIRKPATRICK, assigned to my case after my initial conversation with the apparently drunk, elderly attorney, Mr.BURICK of Redding CA, I told him, immediately, I had concerns with his choice of representation for me and I would like a different attorney. I only requested that he/she be sober and of a reasonable age. He said he would work on finding someone better suited for me but of course that never happened. He avoided me like the plague, does not return phone calls or answer emails or registered letters.  When he did appear he was extremely rude and did not want to work with me, he fell asleep in the middle of the courtroom to where I had to wake him up.  He fought for what the DA wanted not for me. Then the next 4 or 5 court dates he just did not show up, no notification or anything which landed me up in jail, twice, and cost me an additional $11,000 cash in bail money. In addition to the bail money I am now out the $6,000 I paid Imhoff for their so called representation and now representing myself.  Mr. Burick did nothing for my case, he wrote no motions or petitions. The only thing he did was show up a few times. When I had my witnesses drive the 600 mile trip to the court hearing he refused to call either of them in my defense. Finally after the court notified him that he had to appear in court he lied to them and said he was on his death bed and could not finish the case. But what he told Imhoff and Associates was something totally different. Imhoff has known from the very first day that I was not pleased with the attorney they put on my case and they have done nothing to correct that and now that Mr. Burick lied to the court and to them to be removed from my case they have provided me with no one.  They need to refund me back my money. They are nothing but Thieves!  There are plenty of other attorney's out there DO NOT USE IMHOFF AND ASSOCIATES!!!!< /Text>< Pictures>

<Review>Bruce And Jose Are Amazing!

Please, please, give this particular Boomerang's food and service a try, you won't regret it at all! The fried zucchini was the biggest portion for an appetizer I've ever had, the fresh garlic in the mashed potatoes, just perfect, and the chicken wings were very generous in portion size.

The service was something I haven't been given since the 1970's or 80's; so personalized, friendly, and, they just made our short stay like being at home.  And, for me, that means a lot.

I'm going to make Boomerang's a regular stop!</Review><Rating>5</Rating><user_name>License2Diva. Com< /user_name>< gmapID>

I ordered a burger and sandwich with this restaurant. As I taste it, it was good and delicious. From now on, I would order again and again. Besides, the staff was very informative and nice to me. He served me well and right. It was great!<//text>

Make your own with 3 ingredients or select from a tasty chef choice. Very good selection of side dishes.. You pay for them but they are worth it. Small place but nice atmosphere.  Just wish it was a little cleaner especially in the current health climate. Bathroom was a germ/ filth factory. Service was polite courteous and productive. If you are out for a BIG elite burger this is the place. Maybe just get it to go.</Review><Time>1607388498608</Time><user>105128831959701963160<//user>< Rate>

<text>Outstanding! Must go!! The owners are simply wonderful, friendly,  and genuinely concerned for your safety and comfort.  We asked about eating outside as my husband is an ER nurse and they set up and prepared  a table for us that was separate!! They will be having more outside seating when restrictions are in place so this is a safe place to come eat.  And the food! My gosh,  what a selection!! Huge menu with so many fabulous and unique items. Love the build your own burger or mac n cheese options.  We ordered the kitchen sink burger and the chicken and bacon Mac and cheese.  Everything was very fresh, tasty and hot.  They don't salt everything so the subtle flavors of the food are just delicious. We will be back to try more, next time - the meatloaf!!< /text>< gmapID>

A very unique restaurant. It’s actually very large, with two floors, but all the customers and staff were upstairs, where there is a small bar and a handful of tables.

We ordered a couple of burgers, with fries and onion rings. Everything was quite good. The buns were thin and crisp, and the lettuce and tomatoes were extremely fresh. I especially liked the pickles.

The staff was awesome. Very helpful and friendly.</Review>

Big fan of their grab and go breakfast stand. Had a bacon sando this morning and they use nice thick cut bacon that has some real tooth to it. Add some of their fine chunky ish ketchup and you've got yourself a nice breakfast. Grab and go breakfast stands should be more of a thing.<//review>

This place is a hidden, eclectic gem, literally. Tucked away, behind another restaurant and upstairs. The food was great and the service was fun. They love their regulars and definitely appreciate new visitors such as me and my family. It's not for everyone, but I recommend giving the place a try.</Text>

Amazing!!! Everything is off the charts good! Burgers to appetizers (poppers are best I've ever had) and drinks are all huge portions and made fresh with excellence. Can't wait to come back to San Diego!< /text>

Boomerang was invented in Philippines or was it in Australia!

Gourmet hamburger called Boomerang!  Sure, customers will return!

Well, if this place serves excellent food then it will stay open!

Eat meat!

I do not recall visiting a year ago so I give 5 stars since every man and woman was intended to be created perfect in the beginning!

Wouldn't you think that the "Nothing to Molecules to Man" Darwin origin of species theory means a trash can is capable to evolve into a Ferrari?<//Text>

<review>Let me start by qualifying my review. We had our ordered delivered during the shelter-in-place and that certainly impacted the quality of burger we received.

I ordered the ABC Burger. I love burgers and have been eyeing Boomerang's for a while. However, when it arrived, the food was lukewarm and the lettuce was wilted. I barely ate half the burger before hitting a point where I didn't want to eat anymore (because of the flavor/texture). I am willing to give this place another shot when we are able to dine in.

My wife got the Grilled Blackened Chicken Mac N Cheese. This was also a bit cold but the flavor was great. I would eat this dish again for sure.< /review><UserId.>100945290097981964438</UserId.>< Rating>

I ordered an Angus Beef Burger and twice baked mashed potatoes, IT WAS DELISH! Food was amazing atmosphere matched, very lively shortly after we arrived the place filled up and happy sounds filled the air. We have lived in SD for five and a half years, the burger was the best I’ve eaten since moving here.
Thank you for good food, atmosphere and service...
Definitely a spot to repeat, classic hidden treasure!<//review><Name>Jimmy Harris< /Name><gmapID>0x80dc0058556d6483:0xc63269d1910bc67e<//gmapID><date>1514004500329<//date><rate>5<//rate>< Resp>

<Text>I am totally shocked and can NOT believe the way these people spoke to me on the phone. I ordered a grub hub order at 6:30pm. It was scheduled to be delivered between 7:25-7:35. A driver never came to pick up my order from the restaurant if it’s 7:50-8:00 am a driver hasn’t picked up the order then you should be calling grub hub. When I called the restaurant I asked how far they were from Mira Mesa Blvd as I am not here from here from. I am from out of state. Two different males on the phone argued with me called me a snot and were extremely rude! I work in customer service! If you guys are 5 miles from this hotel the right thing to do would be to bring me my order. And I was willing to take tip off grub hub order and give to them! He insisted I cancel and did not want to make my order. I have NEVER been spoke to by anyone in the restaurant industry.</Text></record></dataset><record>

When you pull up outside you aren't really sure what to expect, but it was by far the best burger I have had. To top it off, the service is fantastic.

<Text>One of San Diego’s truly hidden gems. Been visiting for years and look forward to coming back. The staff are all amazing and polite people that treat you like family. The decor has a San Diego vibe that chain restaurants cannot replicate. Local art, cool decor, and friendly staff.. why are you still reading this and not pressing start directions!?< /Text>< gmap_id>

<review>Be hungry when you go here. The owners are cool. One is flamboyant and the other more subdued. They each seem to care deeply about the quality of their food. The portions are large, so if you're not too famished, choose something to share. By the way, there's a good selection of beers too.  Have fun.< /review>< pics>

This place is great!  Went here prior to going to the movies with friends.  The staff is very friendly and warm with great service.  The food is wonderful.  Burger's are the best, homemade potato chips were the bomb!  The drinks were amazing, even the coffee was good.  We will be returning again.< /Review>

I love that you can arrange your order any way you like (I made a whole30 compliant meal out of the chop chop salad). I am eager to try out so many different items on the menu and they all have so many variations! The atmosphere was super friendly and chill (and child friendly, too). The staff were fun and accommodating (we were an impromptu party of 10!). I will definitely be back.< /review>

Best hamburger in town hands down! At first you think is this place upstairs? Yep it sure is. Then you think is this a real waiter? Yep it is you should have seen him at Christmas! Then you slowly meet everyone working there and it's like a great feeling of home in a weird way cause you feel like you've stepped into another realm. Anyways the food choices are outstanding and wait til you try the burgers! The best superbly the best! Who would have thought this place existed tucked away upstairs!!<//review>

This was such a fun place to discover. The service was fantastic, the food was good, and the atmosphere was spot on. They also had a large menu with lots of options. The burger was perfectly cooked and my lemon garlic shrimp was so fresh and delicious. Many choices of beers and a cider on tap! Plus, a great happy hour. They checked every box.</Text>

Burgers are AMAZING! Truly a destination for hamburger artistry. This place is hard to find, it's set back behind another building, up on the top floor, but it's worth it. Probably best burgers in San Diego. Good selection of local craft brews, friendly staff, and lots of regular customers.</Text>

Such a great place. My date took me there for the first time. My burger was amazing and so flavorful. I ordered the bad breath burger and garlic herb fries. My date ordered the mushroom burger and sweet potato fries. The appetizer was fried calamari.

The food was delicious and I was super full. The owners are really nice and very hospitable. Will for sure go back again.< /review>

<review>Nice little discovery! Cozy little place hidden off of Clairemont Dr. Looks like it'd be a popular, happening little neighborhood bar/hangout. They have a bar, as well as table seating.

Service was fantastic, we had a big group and it was a great time. Their burgers and their Mac 'n Cheese are intense, mine wasn't seasoned as well as I'd like but other than that, on point. Great place for halal burgers<//review>

Immense menu. Some traditional items, some very creative ones. Tasty!  Enjoyable location, mainly sitting in the bar area with sports on TVs, but pleasant, and run by a couple of characters.</review>

They always have a few options on tap and the mixed drinks are huge.

Not gonna lie, I was a little skeptical at first but I am a big fan of SD dive joints. The food and service are amazing. The burgers are fresh and actually cooked the way you order it. Hands down to the staff here and the best part my 6 year old cleared his plate. Whoot whoot!<//review>

<text>This is a cool and laid back restaurant that is tucked away and easily missed from the street. They have a good selection of craft beers on tap, and their burgers at top-notch. Boomerangs lets you customize your burgers with mix in, toppers, sauces, and seasoning. Worth the visit for good food, beer, and atmosphere.</text></record></dataset><record>

I really love all the burgers..Especially the BAD BREATH.  LOL
ALSO....best Fish and Chips, and the Boom boom Shrimp.
I always order the Ceasar Salad because it sooo Fresh.
I have many more things on their menu I still wanna try. Love you guys 😎<//Text><pics>None< /pics><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

<Review>If you love hamburgers, you MUST try this place! They have every topping, spice, sauce combination for your burger and a good selection of ales.  I enjoyed the roasted garlic parmesan fries!  I came here at 3 in the afternoon, so no counting for Grace under fire, but the burger tasted great.</Review></record>

Best burgers I have ever had.

The atmosphere is great, its not what you would expect for how good it is though. They have TVs displaying sports or news or whatever else, which doesn't really bother me one way or the other. The owners are the nicest people. They love to come and talk to you like you were a close friend, which is amazing. They are down to earth, and love to hear your honest feedback. They are always thinking up new ideas to make the customers happier.

Their location is a bit strange, and its easy to miss where you pull in. I am a new driver though, and I could do it easily. The location has a very homey feel to it, which I adore.

So! The food. Their menu, which I heard that they are freshening up a bit, looks a little daunting. It isn't. It is in big font, which makes it easy to read, but makes it look kinda like the menu is bigger than it is. What I got this last time was the make your own burger. You get to choose your meat, cheese, toppings, insides of the burger, your side, the works. I got my burger medium rare, and it was delicious. I have leftovers waiting for me in the fridge it filled me up so well! (They've even won awards as far as I know!)

These wonderful people need to see some more love. They are incredible, and so very sweet. We need to get the news out there about them.

I hope my review helped with the decision to eat there!< /review>

<review>Boomerang's is a unique burger joint in the Clairemont Mesa area. It's not very noticeable from the main road, and even from the parking lot, the entrance is hidden away in a little courtyard. First, the criticisms: The building seems older and not well taken care of. This is emphasized by the hodgepodge decorations (but not in a good way). There was also no music (though I did notice ceiling speakers), which contributed to making the ambiance awkwardly quiet since there were few guests when we went and the restaurant is surprisingly large. On the positive side, our waiter (Jose) was very friendly and attentive. I had a 1/2lb Bad Breath Burger with Chilli Pepper Onion Rings. I love garlic; so, having garlic mixed into the Patty was amazing. Staying true to it's name, the cheese of choice is gorgonzola, and it is slathers with just enough fresh horseradish. Grilled onions galore top the creation, and on the side comes a creamy garlic-horseradish mayo. The Chilli Pepper Onion Rings have a wonderful crunch and get an added kick by the jalapeno topping. It comes with habanero ketchup which is good, though not as spicy as I hoped for, given the name. Overall, it's a delicious meal in an okay space. But, I think it's worth a shot!<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures></record>

Excellent burgers. Reasonably priced cocktails. Atmosphere could be considered cozy but also felt a little dingy. Colorful, friendly service.</text>

The hamburger menu is too complicated. Not just for the guests, but for the server and the cook too. The bacon on the burger was excellent  even still, the order did not come out right, but they fixed it. The food looked great, but not seasoned enough, it was kind of bland. But there was a lot of food, they did not skimp on the serving!<//text>

Clever idea. Very "creatively" decorated, and even more creatively staffed. It's not Red Robin, it's not Island's. it's a mix of both burger styles with a smidge of neighborhood flair.<//Text>

<Text>Sooooo many different things on the menu it's a bit overwhelming!

The sides we had were both great, especially the onion rings!

Two negatives that knock it down to 4 stars - the beer was warm :-( maybe it was due to it being 100 degrees out, but still unacceptable. Second there was no one on the first floor to greet us so we just kind of wandered around until we figured out we had to go upstairs.

The food was really good though, so we'll be back.< /Text><Resp>None< /Resp><username>Simon N<//username><pictures>None< /pictures>< date>

Service was always SLOOOW. We went here a couple of times (mainly since it’s close) and the food was meh, until the last time when I found dirt on the lettuce of my burger. Bigger than my thumb and thick enough you couldn’t see through it. Yuck. When we finally found the manager he shrugged like it was normal and didn’t even apologize. Eater beware.<//review>

-Cold hot wings
-Cold, old-frozen-food-tasting cheesesticks
-Cold jalapeno poppers
-The driest burger you've ever had
-Flat soda to drink
-The beer cheese soup looked like they dumped feta cheese in it and tasted like stale bread

The owner was apologetic and comped my appetizer, entree and soup and took 1/2 price off my wife meal because we did not eat any of it nor did we want to take it home.

Never ever coming back here again.<//Text>< Pictures>

We ordered 2 apps and 2 entrees with salads. Approx 68 bucks with 15% tip.
The salads were ok. The rest of the food was awful.
I called the restaurant to see if the chef had a stroke or something, and let them know the food was well below expectations.
The man who answered the phone interrupted me repeatedly and said I was being "mean" when I told him the mac and cheese was a soggy old inedible mess with separated cheese sauce- totally microwaved.
He declared that all was "made to order" and when I suggested he hire a new chef (I have to now assume I was speaking to the sensitive chef?) he tried to blame the yelp eat24 driver on the poor quality food.
I'll post pics of the Philly cheesesteak- lettuce and tomatoes- whyyy?? And a big ole hunk of overdone steak, apparently couldn't be bothered to slice it thin- or at all.
Burger- super soggy bun. When an order is going out for delivery you should know how to package it.
And the worst offender- which made me put down my fork and start this review- the mac and cheese. Disgusting. Mushy, greasy, separated sauce and pasta was cooked to death.
Calamari- frozen strips. I want rings and tentacles, you know- real food.
All of it was flavorless and overdone. Huge portions of low quality product. Oh boy!<//text>

<Review>Didnt even eat there. I walked in with my wife and two children. They greeted us and showed us to a table. We looked on floor and there was dog poop all over the floor. Thats is un sanitary and un sat for a restraunt. I will never even consider going back there!!!<//Review><rating>1< /rating><user>110586983262216035713< /user></record>

I was here yesterday trying to locate a restaurant. I stared blankly at the directory unable to figure out which floor the restaurant was on. I gave up and decided to just go floor by floor because I vaguely remembered where it was. And then I realized the directory was touch screen. LAME! I know SF sits in the hotbed of technology but still.. What happened to good ol floor plans? Now we have to wait in line to use the directory because people want to "play" with it.</text>

<name>Lady Patriot 711<//name><Review>We love to dine at Tommy Bahamas in the Corona del Mar Plaza. We came in at about 3 p.m. for a late lunch early dinner and we were seated immediately on a Saturday. This restaurant has been completely remodeled with high ceilings, Breezy open doors to the sidewalk and Patio, and a great rectangular bar sitting right in the middle of the restaurant. Aside from the relaxing beachy elegant atmosphere the food is always divine. I had the crab and avocado salad and my husband had the filet mignon salad but that was not the the only star in the show. We ordered the grilled scallop sliders to start with and honestly I've never tasted a more tender juicy fresh from the ocean scallop in my life. The blue crab was good fresh but a little lacking in flavor however the salad underneath it was delicious. And finally our server Maureen was excellent. Just the right friendliness and attentiveness and anticipated our needs before we asked. Afterwards we took a stroll on the Beach ending a perfect Saturday afternoon in Newport Beach California!<//Review><Time>1566767815716<//Time>< userid>

This is a great little shopping center, You can even use the circuit app to catch from Franc hear from fashion Island.  Bristol farms is the main grocery store in the plaza, you can also find restaurants, a jewelry store, nail salon, I think there is even a Jacks surf shop!</Text>

this has the famous Bristol farms market which is quite possibly the best supermarket in all of Orange countywe the best fish and meat counter and the best wine store in the entire county. The shopping center also has the infamous of sprinkles cupcakes as well as their sister store sprinkles ice cream. for a real treat combined a sprinkles cupcake with ice cream.< /Review>

Oh, where to begin with Corona Del Mar Plaza. You provide a safe clean place to poop when things get a little scary on the PCH. You provide a high shopping experience for my wealthy neighbors, and now and again I pop in for a pack of juicy fruit and aome Perrier. You have done well with the parking garage by the library and its built in electric vehicle charging stations are a nice feature to prepare us for the future... so well, that we need more, more I say!!!# Muahahahahaa!!!!</text>

I would have rated them with 5 stars if they stocked more organic items, which were surprisingly significantly less than even Ralphs stocks, even in their produce section.
Wonderful wine selection, and fresh, exotic potted and picked flowers.< /text>< Pictures>

Good stores and restaurants but, the parking is very bad . The lot is still under construction and Tommy Bahama had a valet service for a special event that blocked about a quarter of the spaces.  Very poor management.<//Review>

Sur de la Table is nice, but charges too much for a cooking class.  I like shopping at Fashion Island rather than Corona Del Mar Plaza. Fashion Island's Whole Foods beats the Plaza's Bristol Farms in providing a wide selection of organic and health options.  The boutique stores don't seem to have the interesting and wide variety of clothes offered at Fashion Island boutique stores.  Just my opinion!<//Review>

(Translated by Google) Good place to do your shopping, there are many places of food the problem is that the parking is not very large, I do not recommend going in high seasons, it becomes crazy there.
