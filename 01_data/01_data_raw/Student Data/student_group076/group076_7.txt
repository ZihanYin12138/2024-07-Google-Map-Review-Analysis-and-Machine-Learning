Every time we head back from big bear we stop by this little gem. Persian desserts with authentic Chinese food. The view outside is amazing & refreshing. If you are passing thru arrowbear… this stop is a must!!!</Text>

This place was great it's my second time driving up a mountain and I was a little nervous. When I got to the top this place was here. They welcomed me and talked to me. To help calm me down they even gave me a free cup of tea with my meal that I purchased which was very good. Thank you guys so much!< /Review>

This is "food wise" an above-average Chinese Restaurant which I frequently visit. The folks here are charming and the portion size is, er, YUGE.

I highly recommend the Hot & Sour Soup (made by scratch on-site) as well as their Orange Chicken and the Wolf Fish (I've never heard of it but it's d-e-l-i-c-i-o-u-s!

Also, if you or your family walk in there with any kind of sweet tooth they have a wonderful bakery greeting you whence you first walk in the door.

The Proprietors are kindly and charming. This is a SUPERIOR DINING EXPERIENCE and I'm sure glad that they decided to do business here locally in Running Springs!

They have a patio dining area and live music on the weekends.

Go. You'll thank me.</text>

<Review>My boyfriend really likes the food. I'm not s crazy about it as he is.
The place is very clean and well organized.
Their egg tarts are to die for.  Only problem is they only made them if someone requested them. So I  guess I'll be calling tomorrow and order a few.
Very friendly environment.  They have outside tables. And on Friday and Saturday they have a live band .
The patio is dog  friendly!!< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

This place is my number one restaurant.  Of all restaurants I know I love it most. I never miss an opportunity to go to visit this place. when  I want to go to a decent lunch, this restaurant comes instantly to my head.  Great and all sorts of  food and a rich cuisine.courteous staff, and good spirit. And very important, the price is affordable. I suggest this spot with great pleasure.< /Review>

Try their honey walnut shrimp, nice and crispy outside and juicy inside bursting with flavor. We also enjoyed their bbq pork, singapore rice noodle, and orange chicken. They're also a bakery and had great mixed berry pie with creampuffs and they didn't skimp out on the cream it was absolutely stuffed. Friendly customer service as well</Text>

We enjoy going out. Yesterday we  visited this delicious place which we didn’t know before. We spent a delightful evening there with very good cooking and an efficient team and a talented chief cook. We  added this restaurant in our phone list  and we will certainly come back soon. We deeply recommend.<//review>

The staff is so friendly and will make you feel at home. The ambience and patio seating is so peaceful. A perfect and a must stop on your way to Big Bear but also worth a drive from LA if you craving good authentic familt style Chineese food.<//Review>< pics>

Can't find a better one... on the mountain. Or Even in the valley.

We got to sit in patios which they built very nicely and enjoyable.

The food entries are similar to Panda Express, except the taste is lighter which is suitable for people who's on diet or high blood pressure.

The soups were very good actually, we ordered chowder and egg drop soups, though all were good, the chowder has a richer taste and flavour which can be a good choice.

If you are a fan of beef, try smoked beef. It is very tender and high smoke flavor, it may look light and not so interested, but once you have the first peace, you will be amazed of how soft and rich it is, and unlike other place where smoked products usually tasty or salty, this is completely different.

I also love there taco tea and ginger tea. I'm an asian and have tried many places, taro milk tea is my favorite drink, and I felt in love with their milk tea. All tea are made with fresh and real ingredients, not from power like most of the tea shop out there. Tea were light and not too sweet, but the flavors is full and rich. Boba is very soft and tender too. Must try it.

Ah, plus: dont forget to try ginger tea, it's good and will keep you well in the cold weather of the mountain.

Enjoy your trip and meals.<//Review>

<Text>Delicious vegetarian options! Owners were kind, welcoming, and helpful during our visit - they even have homemade Baklava! Delicious fried tofu varieties and a sweet fresh ginger drink to wash it down.

<Text>This is a family owned restaurant with a huge outdoor patio, thier selection changes as they make food daily. I come here often and the food gets better and better. Coming here always makes me smile as the matriarch of the restaurant (who i will refer to as auntie) showers you with offers, gives us tastes of sake and new products, always ensures we have fresh desert and will always throw in extras like wontons and egg rolls. You can tell they just really enjoy feeding people. I mentioned i needed to diet and Auntie gave me a big portion of stir fried veggies on the house and told me to eat it all. Wish nothing but the best for her and her family. Support this local business</Text>< rating>

The food here is delicious! The staff is incredibly nice, and I love how they overfill your plate with food so you actually feel like you got what you paid for. You will not regret trying this place out.< /review>

Visited this this place last night for the first time. We were blown away with the service, the ambiance, and the fresh and delicious food.  We arrived 30 minutes before closing. They had food in the warmers, which is what I thought I was going to be served...nope, they made us a fresh batch of orange chicken and kung pao chicken. The owners were accommodating and very friendly. They gave us a free appetizer and a large Persian puff (which was delicious). We will be back to taste the smoked brisket (which the owner said is the best on the mountain and sells out quickly).<//review>

Chinese food in the mountain? I definitely did not expect the food to be so authentic. Three of us ordered one soy sauce fried rice with veggies, Kung Pao tofu, and stir-fried cabbage and the serving size is very generous. It ends up lasting us two meal plus a bit extra. The owner is a very very nice Chinese lady. She gave us some of the house specialty spicy potatoes to try since I told her we are all vegetarian. Anyway, if you are visiting running springs and you want to have some good Chinese food, Hilltop is the place to go.<//review>

Best food in town! My wife and I came here during the 4th of July weekend. We had fried rice, stir fry cabbage, and teriyaki tofu. Which was way more than enough for 3 adults. Everything was delicious, and the customer service was on point. I would highly recommend this place if you are in town. Great place for vegetarians or anyone craving good Chinese food.</Text>

<Text>Delicious food and great service make this restaurant an outstanding option for locals and folks traveling through Running Springs. Hilltop Chinese is great for kids and groups. The menu always has new delicious options but the honey walnut shrimp are too good to pass up. Tonight they had green beans that my kids were fighting over.  It's a local gem well worth the visit.</Text>< Pictures>

< Review>
I've been watching reviews and listening to feedback from other locals, and finally decided to try the food tonight. I'd add pictures, but devoured my meal without foresight.

As we walked in, a man working at a table welcomed us warmly, and was followed quickly by the counter staff. They are all very friendly, inviting and happy to answer any questions. We were offered samples and my otherwise simple decision became complicated. The pork was moist, tender and not overwhelmed by other flavors. I brought home orange chicken, honey walnut shrimp and broccoli beef, and was impressed by each.

As others have said, the honey walnut shrimp was delicious, and cooked to perfection. The Orange Chicken was a great choice - tender chicken with light breading and a perfect complement of orange sauce. The broccoli beef was cooked so well. The broccoli is very fresh, and only lightly steamed, so that the crisp stalk crunches as you bite through. I prefer this, and found it to be excellent. The beef melted in my mouth, and was almost in equal proportion to the amount of broccoli.

Running Springs has needed a variation on the restaurants we've had for years, and this perfectly answers the call. I can't wait to go back, and plan to bring all our friends and family!<//Review>

My daughter and I always love Hilltop Chinese :-)

The Owners and staff are always so nice and always seem to go the extra mile to help, they also let you taste test the food if needed and the Persian Creme Puffs are ti die for :-)

Great job everyone :-)<//Text>

<Review>Wonderful! our second visit and we loved our entrees. i had Braised Tofu and Hilltop-Style pork and they were great. a little year in the pork. will definitely  get that again. wife had broccoli and beef and cleaned her bowl! each had a spring roll too and they were crispy and yum. PLUS we each got great fortunes! :-)   Must try this place - best Chinese food in the area!<//Review><Rate>5</Rate><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

<review>I am a local resident and have been to this restaurant 5 times and every time it was better. Once they work out all the growing pains I'm sure this restaurant will be one of the most popular in town. I enjoy their chicken and beef. The egg rolls are also very good. I would definitely recommend this place to anybody coming thru the great town of Running Springs.</review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x80c4abc1090cbeb9:0xc498ed77713b8202< /gmap_id></record>

Our kids wanted Chinese food during our vacation stay in Big Bear 🐻. We drove by the restaurant and said we would go and try it out. We are glad that we did because food was good but seemed that it was from the night before made. Based on other reviews prior to mine...there’s a possibility for greater taste in their food which I think on our next trip it will!</Review>

I've been to this place twice in one day and the  service was great. They were very friendly and welcoming. The food was amazing and the prices are reasonable for being in the mountain. The decor was awesome and I'm looking forward to going there again.< /text>

This restaurant is new and still has a few kinks. Be patient. I would have liked more onion and cabbage in the chow mein. It needed more flavor. The honey walnut shrimp was excellent. Line moves a little slow but should get better with time. Owners are very friendly and trying hard to please customers.< /Text>

I can honestly say that they get an A+ for outstanding service. I only tried two dishes, one was good, one was tasteless. Their chicken terriyaki was quite tasty. The orange chicken was very bland. The place was spotlessly clean. There's not a lot of parking spaces out front, but plenty of seating inside for groups large and small. I'm looking forward to trying some of their other dishes.</Text>

<review>I read reviews before I visited them. One thing brought up was the blandness of the food. If you normally visit Mr. You or Panda Express the flavors are more bland. Or if you normally eat spicier foods it is blander.
It has been my experience that traditional/authenic chinese food is blander.

I found it to be so, however you really get the flavors of ginger etc.  they just aren't powerful. I had the beef and broccoli and their hilltop pork with cabbage ( very flavorful and a must try). Both the beef and pork were extremely tender...no grizzle or fat. The veggies were perfect.

I did take out, but the restaurant is very nice and welcoming.</review>< pics>

The food is great and the s. The over all quality is better then the other competitors here on the mountain; "Crestline", "Agua Fria". It is fresh and the meats are of better quality and cut, I'm not questioning if its really chicken. They also have great foreign deserts and small treats. Its my pick on the mountain for a fresh tasting Chinese dinner in a clean friendly environment.< /review>

They are now open and serving express, buffet  style Chinese food. Great prices but still not sold on the food. Need to get rolling and learn how to keep fresh and warm. Other than that it's good stuff.<//Text>

When i saw 3 an a half stars i asked people coming out how the food was. Its ok, they said, so we were going to go on down the road. But the owner was standing outside, and heard the conversation. He came over and said *you will LOVE my food*...challenge accepted, we walked in to try it out. Boy, am i glad we did. He was friendly right from the start. Long story short, we tried almost every dish there. Fish very good, my absolute favorite was bbq pork, very different, but wow. Curry another fave....orange chicken too. Shrimp was great too.....definitely be back SOON.< /Text>

Great place. Great food. Officially open as of Dec 8th.
UPDATE
I've been by two more times since my first review. Still super happy with them. Yummy food, nice staff, fair prices, cute ambiance. free wifi. what more could you ask for in a small town joint. Love it!

Original Review.
The people who left one star reviews before this place even opened are so incredibly rude. I ate here today and it was great.</Review>

Huge portions!  Tasty.  I like that you get a drink with your meal.  Very friendly.  Thank you for supporting uniformed fire fighters! I'm thankful this place was able to open after wading thru the country red tape.  Way to stick with it!</text>

<text>Food was cold for being buffet food at 5pm for dinner.  The seating outside got mine and my daughter's pants full of sap.  Owner was unapologetic and told me I was making work for him when the door handle fell off the door.  Won't go there again.< /text>< Rate>

Can’t believe people are giving one star when your not even open yet! I realize you are having much difficulty with permits as all new businesses experience up here. In anticipation I will give you 5 and to help offset those ridiculous ones!< /Review>

they closed almost 2 hours early  super bent  drove by seen people banging on window no response super weak.

Me and my wife finally got in time for a real review here we are not happy. The owner is very cheap with portion control  did not get what we paid for. Better Chinese food in San Bernardino we will all be surprised to see this place open in a year place wasn't open on time food wasn't ready. No  diner ever opened up like this up here super big fail avoid at all cost unless you wanna be ripped off. In time all these fake reviews will be drowned out by the real reviews  of 1 star. We are done with them forever and they just opened up. Go in for your self get ripped off and eat ur little box of food we did. Gonna go ahead and do our business with the buffets in  the city.<//text>

Decent Chinese food. Staff was very friendly. My only complaint is the Hot and Sour soup.  Normally one of my favorite things at a Chinese restaurant, but its quite bland there.  Bbq pork is my favorite.</Review>

Not sure where all these photos are coming from. I live literally across the street from this place and they haven’t been open AT ALL. They were supposed to open months ago but never did. It also still looks like they’re doing loads of work on the place before opening (if they ever do).< /text>

<Text>One of the managers there Amanda is the nicest always goes above and beyond to help the whole staff here is more than great friendly attentive and full of knowledge it's refreshing to see a team that really takes pride in what they do. They always treat everyone equally with respect. A special thanks to Brian that helped me out with a special glass piece that's not easy to come by again went above and beyond.

Went here today to try and view their “huge” selection, however, even I don’t have THAT much patience.
There was a sign on the door that read “Be back in 5 minutes” and door was locked. I waited 30 minutes total, getting out of my car 3x to check door. Finally I gave up and went to the Smoke Shop across the street.
When I came out of that store, I saw 2 other poor people standing outside the door (they must’ve believed the sign also).< /review>

We are so sorry you had to wait that long as we were dealing with electrical issues to where we had to close down, we unfortunately had the wrong sign up not realizing the timing on the sign said 5 Minutes’s. Hope you give us another try. With a 20% discount on your next item (excludes tobacco)'}< /resp>

This place has a huge selection, been driving around all day and finding only places with minimal selection. When I stumbled apon this place I was quite impressed! They also have great customer service, Sam was super nice and helpful. I will be recommending this place to all my friends.<//Review>

This location is a ripoff they will charge you more because the people they have working in there are working off of sales as well not only hourly. You'll notice most of the items don't have price tags and they even charge 110% more when it comes to buying single cartridges for vape pens.<//review>

I would like to clarify that none of our employees work off of commission at all and we thrive to have the best pricing in the inland empire. Also all of our items in the store are required to have SKUs and pricing as it is necessary in order to make a sale through our POS systems. We would love to hear what went wrong during your visit and make it right. Please send us an email at glassrootsontario@gmail.com and we look forward to hear from you.'}<//Response><gmap_id>0x80c335989f0acc93:0x2166d93e6214333d< /gmap_id></record>

This establishment is one of the most beautiful joints in the I.E. by far. I had the pleasure of meeting a very informative sale representative, and the owner. Very genuine team over here. Definitely worth the visit. They also have a wide variety of disposable nicotine devices including the latest and most popular: Bang Bar XL which offers up to 600 puffs, and Xtras which offer up to 1500 puffs. LALA Land by Xtra is like a Peach Ice Bang bar, and a little similar to the Ice Peach by Drip, but you get up to 1500 puffs! Oh, and yes there is like 11 flavors of Drip Bars here. If you have to travel a little to go visit this place, it will be worth. The music in at they place is amazing, the vibe is chill, and fun. GO check them out, for sure.< /Text>

The shop is well lit and has a large showroom so no need to squeeze by other patrons. The staff is well knowledged about all thier goods and meet you with a smile.

< review>
I was late 1 hour; arrived at sharp 9am bcz there was thunderstorm night before in Vegas. Guess what !! They unloaded me next morning?? No tolerance very unprofessional especially the dark fat guard.

< Review>
To be honest my opinion is that there should be more control on the employees and there performance. Today I had a second experience with the store but this one located on Garey & Lexington inPomona Ca.
So this employee in Bakery department is very rude.
I went and she is the only person in bakery and I was the only person there, and she seen me and still left me waiting for 5 minutes.  Besides that, I tell her that I want to place an Order on a cake and she just points towards the book for me too choose one from there, but I tell her that its not going to have a design and that I just want it half a sheet and only the borders on it.  The female  employee roles her eyes at me and responds to me with attitude that it depends on what I want.  I am not asking for a price or design, im just asking for a simple half of sheet cake with the borders. I was very disappointed with her rude and unprofessional ways towards me, that I ended up NOT placing my order and left the store.
To be honest this lady is really unprofessional and rude and I dont understand why she would be working there with that kind of attitude.
The fruit, meat, veggies is fresh, but I noticed that in BOTH stores ( Ontario & Pomona ) 95% of the employees give you attitude when needing help with something or placing an order.</Review>

Nice place. There's limited overnight parking off the side of the road on the dirt and pothole'd shoulder. Dont drive up to the guard shack. They'll  make you turn around and park and walk up to the guard shack to check in. Then they'll call you on your phone to a door when they have one.< /Text>

You can check in one hour prior to your appointment you will need to park outside on the street do not drive in the driveway you will be asked to park outside don’t forget to get your truck license plate number you will be asked and also trailer number when you check in they will get your phone number and call you when a door Becomes available Quick in and out my appointment was at 4 AM was out in 25 minutes as the way it should be after you’re done you can still park outside on the street no one will bother you.</review>

<review>I love this store, The Mexican food is AMAZING. If you come here. you have to try the Carnitas Tacos. They are to die for. They have decent prices around the store. sometimes you might get a great deal on the meat. so always swing by the meat department. They have plenty of parking.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<text>As a Professional driver and retired Firefighter/EMT, my experience delivering here has been a nightmare is an understatement! No communication, no pre planning, no parking. That's BEFORE we even made it to the Fuad shack. The guards are very rude and you don't know your NOT suppose to drive up to the guard Shack to check in where 99.9% of deliveries ALL over the United States. Then they tell you to park on the side of the road coming to the guard shack. If there ALL taken, they tell you to back up to the main road and park on the side even though there are signs saying "NO PARKING." These people need better leadership and coordination and pre planning. They also need to learn manners. When you've never delivered here, they just need to explain the situation and not be rude and raise their rudely voice because you didn't know NOT to pull to the guard shack. They also need to understand this is America and they need to speak better English!!!!!</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x80c33454dc8df53b:0x744e6e9e97e706b7< /GmapID></record>

<Text>(Translated by Google) I have been calling for several days to see if I can get my w2 through the human resources system they use to manage check and tax histories to an email since my house has not arrived and they do not answer me. I go to the store where I used to work and all they tell me is to call HQ they can't do anything.

(Original)
Llevo varios días llamando para saber si puedo obtener mi w2 por medio del sistema de recursos humanos que usan para manejar los historiales de cheques e impuestos a un correo electrónico ya que no me ha llegado mi casa y no me contestan. Voy a la tienda en la que solía trabajar y lo único que me dicen es que llame a HQ que ellos no pueden hacer nada.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

<Text>(Translated by Google) They must specify in navigation. That is a distributor. Is not a store. They waste our time, thinking it's a store. And it is a distributor. Correct that on the map or navigation. From Internet.

<Rate>5</Rate><text>Very large parking area for Round valley regional Preserve.  Plenty of room for 50+ vehicles, and also large area for horse trailers to turn around and park.  There is even a corral with several sections, not sure how well they work or if are open.  Parking area is loose gravel.  Small bathrooms, and several picnic tables, and it's by a creek that was dry when I visited Oct '19.  There is a nice bridge that is the start of the fire trails that lead into the park, for horses, bikes and hiking. No dogs or motorized bikes/vehicles, with sever signs.   Bring sunscreen and lots of water if traveling Into park as it's very exposed to sun with some trees for shade in the creek areas.</text>< pictures>

< Review>
Perfect place for a strenuous hike up and over the loop, or a casual hike along the creek.
Beautiful and green this time of year</Review>

Love hiking here. Always get to observe some wildlife anytime of year. Just a couple of trails and nothing too rigorous. The walk along the creek is a nice stretch.< /Review>

<review>Regional park. Plenty of parking, special area for horse trailers. Nice trails mostly in the shade. Allows bikes, hikers, and horseback riders. No dogs! Watch out for snakes in summer.< /review><date>1560112222733< /date>< response>

Nice place for a daytime hike or a picnic. Definitely primitive, but there is a bathroom.<//Text>

Have been going to these location for years, liked the service and work but I recently went and their customer service and attitude with customers is absolutely disgusting. Called for an appointment and was scheduled at 6:30 p.m. and said they were behind schedule, it eventually became 8:00 p.m. and they still did not attend me. When I asked what time they would be ready since I have been there for a long time and still have not be attended and the lady hysterically began arguing with us about how tired she was and that everyone else had to wait over an hour for an appointment so I had to wait the same. So why are they setting appointments if they cannot respect the time. Really rude attitude for mediocre service, definitely would not recommend.< /review>

<Text>I just wanted to share my experience with you. I have not actually got my nails done but i have to grade there professionalism. About 5 months before, i called to make an appointment manager text me and gave me a time and date, when arrived the shop was closed. I called and she totally forgot and calm she didnt but i sent her a screen shot. Crazy. Then today i walked in her shop to try and give them another chance and she said she was booked up till 530pm i told her ill be back and when came back the lady  didnt even look at me and was talking to the other girls then the other ladies said we are not taking anyone, so got the ladies attention that tole me to come back and asked why you tell me to come back her answer was "oh i told you to come back" thats it. Do not go to this place. NOT WORTH IT FOR YOUR BUSINESS.</Text><Time>1618103929326< /Time></record>

<text>I went into the nail shop and the nail tech immediately had a nasty attitude about long nails something i never asked for she was very disrespectful and rude to the point i felt i did something wrong to her she over talked when i let her know i was not there for long nails she complained about how people were giving her bad reviews that i had no idea about until she basically attacked me as if i were the ones putting up bad reviews. The Name professional does not match who they are, they may need to take some etiquette classes and They for sure need to learn work ethic and professionalism if they want to brand that name in a positive way instead of a negative light.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x80c36f05a94688c3:0x51cff9817a2d0899</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>I've veen here quite a few times since they have opened for full sets, fills, eyebrow wax and pedicures. I have never had any problems and they have always done a wonderful job. It's a very clean salon as well. They do get pretty busy so if you walk in there may be a wait. You can also make appointments but they tend to get a lot of walk ins which can sometimes cause them to run behind but I've never had issues with the quality of work. My suggestion is just don't be in to much of a rush when you go because they do get super busy.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x80c36f05a94688c3:0x51cff9817a2d0899<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I've gone here a couple of times vivian is great she is always worried about her customers satisfaction with her work and asks if you like your nails. I always have she does great work and always makes my day with her conversation. If you want to come in just ensure to call they are busy and can take you in as long as you call first so you know what time 💜< /text>

They don’t do long nails. Owner said only short nails can be done at her salon.
I don’t like giving bad reviews but I feel I have  to aware the public. The owner did my nails a few times and they looked good, I guess that would be the one star. On the other hand, I had to hear her complain about the customers. Another time she asked me to come back an hour later and when I did she asked if I could come back the next day. The name is a really bad excuse for the salon because they really lack professionalism. Not at all professional. The owner is ALWAYS in a bad mode. Call the salon yourself and you’ll get attitude from the start. Save yourself a bad experience and choose a didn’t salon. Sorry 😐<//Text>

I told her I really wanted her to get my ingrown nails on my two big toes when I tell you guys she got it out and was so gentle I was amazed! Like you did that! Aha anyways She also painted my nails PERFECTLY like I didn’t go home noticing paint was missing from certain sides of my toes lol I Really hate that!

She just got me as a loyal customer I’m coming back forsure!

If you ask for her she will be good vibes and great quality service you can’t beat it!< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<review>I have never been so mistreated and called a liar in my life. I guess they don't need business cause the lady in charge tells the customers well u can wait a hr or go somewhere else. I hope she isn't the owner. If not the owner needs to know she is rude w/ her i dont give a dam attitude. She lost me as a good paying customer. .<//review>< pictures>

So I arrived at the nail salon at exactly 4:24pm I simply walked in and asked for a pedicure and manicure the lady sitting in the front immediately says OH NO WE CAN’T HELP YOU ITS TOO LATE. I look down at my watch then ask do you close at 5pm she responds NO we close at 6 so standing there a little confused I asked again for the mani and pedi she gives me the same response but this time with a waving motion of her hand for me to leave.😡😡😡 I Unfortunately for them I called the bbb to report them as well as the state board to make sure everyone’s license is up to date 🤷🏽‍♀️</review>

Ridiculous! Called to make appointment for 3 of us. My 2 daughters and myself. The lady who answered the phone said she "does not make appointments for people she doesn't know". How stupid is that? That means they don't want new customers. There are plenty of nail places that would gladly take my money.</Text>

Also overcharged me "by accident"
Better off going down the hill and having actual professionals do my nails this time. This place is a joke< /text>

<Review>Bad service. Its winter and I treated my mother to a fill. They kept the doors open. When my mother complained and asked if they or I could close the door we were told no. Then with 3 ladies working. The woman working on her TOOK A WALK IN TO TGE BACK TO GIVE A WAXING. Didn't say anything to us just simply got up and went to the back. Also didn't wash her hands after.. No lie. Im highly upset. Oh and no they really are not open the time posted on the window and no one answers the phone.

Try another place. Or catch pneumonia or what ever other things lingering in there..<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

She lost me as a customer. I wanted to get a pedicure and a manicure but because I didn't say that I wanted a manicure when I first came in I couldn't get one. What the heck!!! $9 manicure no polish,. She's horrible! This was my first incident with her but I've seen alot with others! I will never go there again.

<text>This place needs to be shut down! There is nothing professional about this place. First of all I had an appointment & still had to wait 30 minutes to get seen. When I finally got seen the nail tech was extremely rough with her tools that she actually cut me extremely bad on the cuticle areas. She had to stop what she was doing to get a paper towel and stop the bleeding! Then I noticed there was a lady getting her pedicure done & the male nail tech was filing her nails with the sponge filer and he dropped it on the floor, picked up the file & continued filing her toenails down! I was disgusted! & also worried about my cut since I just witnessed the nail tech being unsanitary. Don’t trust this place especially after witnessing something like that.</text>< date>

< review>
DO NOT GO HERE I went in for a pedicure everything was good at first Until I asked her to put acrylic on one of my big toes cause it had broke off on one she refused then tried to say she doesn’t know how to do it so she tried to start painting them I told her no because my nail is 2 different sizes it doesn’t look right so she said $10 more for her to do it after she said she didn’t know how to do it so I asked another worker & everyone refused to help me so I paid and just left I will never go here again WORST PLACE EVER< /review>

Went in today to get a full set and wasn't even acknowledged until almost an hour later. Then they told me it'd a 3 hour wait. I ended up leaving because I felt it was very unprofessional. I won't be coming back here.< /text>

The best Chinese restaurant around! Not only is the food absolutely delicious, but the service & family friendly atmosphere is so welcoming. They always remember us. Please give them your take out business during this quarantine to keep them going until we can get back to normal.< /text>

Best food, great service. I'd recommend something to try but everything I've had there has been awesome. Not your typical over greasy Chinese food. Well prepared, fresh veg and excellent flavors. The pot stickers are amazing. Portion sizes are very generous. Three entrees last the 3 of us 2 meals easily.<//Review>

<Review>This place is a hidden gem in the eldorado hills community. it's in the very corner of a little shopping center and can easily be missed but shouldn't. All of their food is very authentic and everyone working was very friendly. I would totally recommend everything on the menu but especially the shrimp fried rice. For the amount of food that they give you and the price that you pay you just can't beat it.<//Review>< Response>

<Pics>None< /Pics><text>I have been going here since we moved here in 1997.  Through several owners (best is current ownership), the menu, price, service, quality, and general ambience has remained consistent and five stars.  Lunch specials include choice of either wonton or hot & sour soup, an entree, a cream cheese wonton, and your choice if either steamed rice, pork fried rice, or chow mein.  Mandarin, Szechuan, and Cantonese styles and items are all available.  Dine in or take out. I highly recommend food at Asian Bistro, from my personal, repeat experience.</text></record>

<Text>Their candied walnut shrimp is delicious. However, I just can't get on board with some of their other dishes. The sauces for their orange and sesame chicken have a strange flavor. Their jungle chicken was very underwhelming: soupy, flavorless. Customer service is always very friendly, but I'll only come for the shrimp from now on.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Jenny is wonderful! We are Gluten Free and she can make so many awesome dishes like sweet and sour chicken GF, my husband’s favorite! I love the beef and chicken with veggies! A must get is the egg flower soup. So comforting! Best Chinese food in El Dorado County!</text>

<Text>The waitress was very nice, spoke perfect clear English which was nice. The food was amazing! I have been looking for a place that has really good beef and broccoli ever since Jenny's palace in Folsom closed down. No other place even comes close to how Jenny's was, all except this one! Perfectly prepared melt in your mouth pieces of beef that we're so tender you wouldn't need teeth to eat. And perfectly cooked, and not overcooked slightly crunchy broccoli all in a not too much that it's soupy sauce that is too die for!  They have Hong Kong style chow mein as a regular menu item and their general chicken is actually spicy instead of this typical sweet sauce that lacks any depth to it like so many other places around here. I will definitely be going back and often.< /Text><Date>1541720922270</Date>< user_id>

<Date>1250043892013<//Date><Rate>4</Rate><text>Though "evil" is part of the name, I love this dish - its heavenly with a slightly sweet curry base and lots of veggies/chicken! I like hot, but you can order it on the milder side.

Asian Bistro has good food, good prices, and you can eat in or take out. Everyone's tastes differ, but I like the great majority of food I have ordered here, and consider it a good value for my money.< /text>< pictures>

Have been visiting this restaurant for a long time, love the service there, always have a great attitude, and there food is delicious, the lunch specials are amazing and filling enough for 2 meals, would strongly recommend their honey walnut prawns and their sesame chicken, oh and can't forget the cream cheese wontons are the best in town.</Text>

<review>Read other negative reviews, but decided to stop by anyway for our caffeine fix. We didn't encounter the surly barista; rather we were greeted by a nice young lady who was nothing but pleasant. I ordered green tea and JL ordered his standard chai latte. Both came out piping hot, which worked out well for our trek on the road. The walls were also loaded with lots of knick knacks and funny signs.

On the downside, there aren't any restrooms, no WiFi, and it's cash only. Boo! You still have the option of buying something at the market next door and getting cash back. Plus, you get to people watch folks coming in from the campsite next door. A feast for all of the senses.<//review>< Name>

While on route for work I stopped in at this small coffee shop in Myers flat. It is a nice little place with a good selection of beverages and a friendly atmosphere. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience and would reccomend anyone passing through to stop and enjoy a cup.<//review>

This place is amazing. I went everyday of my vacation for a a nice Blended Mocha. If you are in the area it is a great deal for great coffee. I had no problems when I went which is rare for a coffee shop. What a great place. Two thumbs up from me.<//Text>

Visiting from New Zealand. This is the only unfriendly place we have visited. Everywhere we go we are meet by warm friendly helpful Americans that are proud to welcome visitors.
The guy running this business is a rude obnoxious ass. Don't spoil your day by calling here. Better to drink water than coffee with no love.< /review>

I enjoyed my double cappuccino which was made with organic coffee so I didn't taste any chemicals, just pure, good coffee. Wish I had another right now! Didn't have any problems with the staff or owner. Myers Flat is a beautiful little place. Sorry that it suffers from "Trimmigrants" and the problems that they bring. If I ever am by that way again, I will definitely stop in again.</Review>

<Review>The best coffee between Portland and Berkeley, and being a European grown daily cappuccino drinker for 25 years I would know :)
Cool people and cute saucy decor, both relax and thought stimulating. It was an unexpected find and we will definitely come back.</Review><gmap_id>0x54d48988bdeeedfb:0xcee53b221fb5094b</gmap_id><name>Lucie Flood</name>< rate>

(Translated by Google) A ritual stop for us every year when we make the avenue of giants. The espresso is really very good. He reminds me of those of France. It is rare to find such good ones in the USA.
The stop here is obligatory.

A nice fairly flat walk under oak trees that's easy to get to, a few rocky spots to cross.  Lots of cyclists on trails during weekends, week days are quieter. Beautiful during rainy season.< /review>

There's no grass or play structure for kids, and gates to parking lot are closed except for Wednesdays and weekends. It's more of a trailhead than a true park. There are also often people hanging in the parking lot smoking or working on their vehicles. Not a great hangout spot for families, but a decent place to park if you're going to hike or bike the Hodges trails.</review>< rate>

<Review>The west end of the total Lake Hodges area is lacking in amenities the  for the family. You don't want to congregate there but go into the park and head down to the east side where you can enjoy the boat docks kayaking fishing and there's a small store for any last-minute purchases you need to do. The park also has a great set of trails for hikers and mountain bikers</Review>< user>

<Pics>None< /Pics><Text>The food was not good.  Not to be mean, but the salsa they served with the chips were too sweet,  not real salsa. Try you tube for a great salsa.  Don't take short cuts. The red chile, no es chile.  The only food was good were the beans. Very disappointed.    Beautiful restaurant.

Disappointed with the service I received. I was told it was a 15-20 min wait to be seated. It was 45. The sever (Rick) came with in two mins and took my order. Another 45 mins past no food. He came by several times and said it will be out soon. I eventually ask for the check and to have to food put in a Togo box. Less than 2 mins later my food was delivered to me in a to go box and paper bag.<//Text>

This is doubtless one of the coolest restaurants in the area. Always when I go there I am highly pleased. They always keep their very high  standard service and the topmost level of dishes  they offer. You no doubt will love this place. Highly  recommended.</Review>

The service is great, very friendly. The food is delicious, the tacos and quesadillas are with home made tortillas. Everything we had was perfectly made. I recommend you eat here if looking for authentic mexican food.< /Text>

<Text>Tia rosas is a mom and pop shop establishment that has hole in the wall quality in terms of environment. There is seating to dine in. The food is delicious i have had the taquitos and the birria both were good portion sizes for 1 person. The tortillas are freshly made and taste great.  They do provide chips and salsa if you chose to dine in. The horchata is good its not too sweet and does not contain to much cinnamon. The service is ok, but do hesitate to let them know if you need anything They will gladly settle any needs you may have.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics></record></dataset><record>

<review>The food is amazing and the chips are light and fresh while the salsa is spectacular, the food is really like a taste from home and is great (sorry running out of adjectives) and is definitely worth a try. The price is also good and the horchata is light and not too sweet .< /review>< Pics>

Chips were stale. We sat outside and there were so many flies! Chorizo and eggs were okay needed more chorizo.  Menudo was just okay.  The guy never came back out to check on us. We had to walk inside to ask for stuff and there were a lot of people working there.< /text>

One of the best pizza place in tracy. Take out and in car delivery available.
Enough parking available at the location. Covid guideline is being followed here too. Hope in house dining will open soon as they have nice seating in house.<//Text>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>If you are reading this and thinking "I dunno man, Indian on pizza?", then I suggest you get rid of that though because as it turns out Indian on Pizza was awesome!  But even if you don't like the Indian options, they make a yummy all meat pizza too.  So what I am saying is go get some pizza, it's super good, and my new fave pizza joint in Tracy.< /Text><Date>1557166080445</Date>< user_name>

<Review>Get ready for pizza with a spicy kick. Kids had regular combo with all the fixings, we had Indian fusion pies. Order it Spicy or mild but definitely try the fusion pizzas. Wonderful Indian paneer, cauliflower and chicken options to choose from.</Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOQlaWoFhH5F1OxpR_-x1aalbxaTS_5-ZK2w_2E=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNOSMuZJDq-ldYKSG_O5TJzkjiPLVFX4fyy5N4k=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< response>

<text>Pizza was excellent, order was placed through a vendor called Slice. That was a surprise and rather jarring. Going to avoid Slice in future. Apparently the order button on the site of this pizza place gets routed to Slice, a company that doesn't honor the promotions on the site. This was my first experience with Slice who took $4.50 for processing my order. It just got very confusing. I may just avoid this place altogether in future.< /text>< pictures>

< Review>
Unique and tasty concept of East-Indian style tandoori chicken and pizza. I had the lunch buffet which was less than $9 including tax, and included salad. I didn't get a drink, but it's just $1 extra if needed.

Overall, I give them a A- only because there wasn't any chai tea. If they had chai tea, I'd give this pizza place an A+ for sure!

There were 3 kinds of pizza out when I arrived, and they brought out more as people took the slices one by one. All together I had about 10 slices, and at least 5-6 different kinds of pizza in all. I remember 2 of the pizzas were vegetarian.

The lunch buffet is on weekdays only. The cashier told me it's from 11-2 Monday thru Friday. They're open 7 days a week, but I forgot to ask her the hours that their restaurant is open< /Review>

<resp>None</resp><Text>If you haven't been to Tandoori Pizza for lunch you have been missing out. I was the first guy there they were just pulling out the pizzas from the oven for the buffet.  For less than 10 bucks, yep that's what I said for less than 10 smackarooos I got all you can eat salad bar, pizza bar, and soda pop bar. That's right with no discounts too, under 10 dollars. And guess what else happened, the food was shut the door slap that mess cook with a spatula great food.< /Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNuUl4GH-bflAkh-o5hT3BQRxbQVrRMY3GgFD7U=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< rating>

An amazing Family owned and operated pizza establishment in the Tracy Area. They really load up on their toppings and never skip out! The pizza has some real depth to it and you can taste ALL the flavors. Highly recommend.< /text>

< review>
delicious pizza. probably one of the best pizza places in town. I love Indian food and was hesitant to try Indian flavors, spices, etc on pizza but it is the best combination ever and I am ridiculous for having been unsure. If you love pizza and you love the flavor of Indian food you will love this place. also all the people commenting about being unsure about using your credit/debit card are clearly not looking at the prices before ordering! I have never had an issue and sure the pizza is pricey but good pizza always is. This isn’t dominos or some pizza chain this is a mom and pop and it is fantastic!</review>

It was my first time there and I'll definitely be back! We ordered a classic combination pizza and a tandoori chicken pizza. The combination had an abundance of toppings and was a large for only about $20. The tandoori chicken was a small for about $14. We should have ordered a large on that, too. The chicken was as little spicy on its own, but was perfect on the creamy garlic sauce! They give you as cold bottle of ranch when you dine in. The staff was friendly. All the ingredients seemed fresh.< /text>

<Time>1581052389748< /Time><Review>So far I've been here several times, because I'm not gonna lie, the pizza is absolutely amazing (specially if you enjoy spicy food which this definitely is), however,  I'm only giving it 3 stars because I've come to the realization that I was definitely overcharged  on my order today which now makes me wonder about all the other times when my total didn't seem right.... so although I do recommend this pizza place based on flavor I also recommend reviewing the menu online so you know what you're paying for your items prior to placing your order specially when using promotional coupons.<//Review><Rating>3</Rating>< Response>

< Review>
This place was great. It is surprisingly spacious on the inside. The food comes out pretty fast and tastes amazing. Just a fair warning that their pizzas do have a bit of a kick so if you arent a fan of spicy of food this might not be the place for you. I really like how clean it is throughout the restaurant. I would highly recommend this place for friends and family.Seems like one of the best indian flavored pizzas. This place doesn't look like much from the outside or really the inside but let me tell you this was such an awesome treat for the three of us. We ordered 2 chicken korma, butter chicken, rice and bread and were so amazed at the flavors. And get this all that food and it was only $27 after tax. Would come here weekly if I lived here but we are from the Seattle area. Don't be fooled by the ordinary decor. The food in this place is so delicious that it has become our family's favorite take-out place in town. The service is excellent and the price quite fair for the quality and quality.< /Review>

<text>Soooo there is alot to say about this place. I've made the mistake of not sampling the buffet before ordering individual pizza. We ordered the extra large half curry chicken and half chicken tikka pizza. The staff seems to be learning on the go so it took a little bit longer than other places to get our pizza. Now the menu indicated which pizza is spicy and which is mild. We ended up with a real spicy pizza even though the chicken tikka wasnt supposed to be spicy at all. My son and parents were on fire from the spice. The pizza tasted great but it was too heavy. Thw sad part is that I've never thrown away pizza before in my lifw but this time i was forced to throw away the extras. I might get a lot of criticism for this but the Indian pizza's should be made on a lighter dough like the naan bread. Im definitely going to hit up the buffet to test all the flavors and support local businesses.</text><Response>None</Response>< userid>

<Text>Last two orders placed online and noticed they charging more than final total listed on e-mail confirmation receipt. Luckily I filled “Dispute transaction” on my credit card and got my money back. I love their pizza but unethical business practices of this pizza store may not help them in long run.</Text>< pics>

From last two orders I have been noticing you guys are just giving cheese pizzas I have ordered vegetables on it but to my shock couldn’t find vegetables on it I know you guys want to make more money by putting less toppings on pizza but kindly don’t cheat the customer by giving just cheese pizza instead of vegetable pizza.<//review>

Good variety of pizzas, was impressed by the taste and variety of both veg and non veg options. Ambience not that great, but they serve beer. So that makes up for any lack of ambience if any.< /Review>

TRASH!!!
They're obscenely over-priced ( they keep it that way to deter working-class folks away from new flavors ... give the poor folk Food Stamp pizza, right?) and the delivery time is a joke. Don't visit in person because you'll be met with dismissive, dirty and down right rude children behind the counter. Zero idea on what customer service is supposed to look and feel like. They've got so many positive reviews...I wonder if that's because they had nephew Prajit work his computer magic. They're just waiting for Silicon Valley to arrive so they can fully reap the investment. Not an actual dining location ... more of a metaphor for the future of Tracy.</text>

A perfectly crisp crust topped with a garlic sauce and flavor packed tandoori chicken and vegetables is a must. And the staff are friendly and helpful. I hope to be back soon.</review>< pics>

<review>Pizza was okay, not bad but not impressive. Service was below average. Girl at counter spent our entire visit on phone and never got us the marinara sauce I requested. $20 for a medium specialty is also average, not cheap but not expensive. 3 stars = Average.< /review>< pictures>

Best pizza place but it's a little to costly. I would recommend lowering prices or having deals/coupons to keep regular customers.<//Review>

If you prefer crispy wings I would ask them to put it through the oven again but they were still very good! The second time I ordered an original combination and they did not disappoint.  Very fresh and full of toppings! Definitely my new pizza place!</Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<review>Ordered Curry chicken pizza. It's really yummy for me as I like spicy food. I like the service as well. For sure i will order again.
By the way, I see about month old some reviews says "service is really bad". As I know this place is opened few day back.</review><Resp>None</Resp>< Rating>

We ordered half and half:  chicken tikka and achar chicken pizza.  Though it was tasty, it was toooooo spicy for us.  This is the reason for 4 Stars.

We ordered a medium size pizza, but a small should have sufficed because of the amount of filling.< /review>< Date>

Been here for pizza buffet. They give you one medium sized pizza of your choice and seems like that is all you can get. And this is for two people. When we asked for more pizza to be brought out, the lady at the register with a confused look on her face says that is all you can get. After some chat she agree to get one more. Not worth the money.<//Text>

<review>Hello ladies and gentleman,

This has to be the best pizza ever because I have been all over the world and I just left NorCal and I am already missing my Tandoori Pizza.

I want to thank Gurpreet for the outstanding customer service and quality food.

The pricing is very fair and affordable and the food is very delicious.

I will be back for more!</review>< userid>

Good storage unit. The woman who works here Noemi is very helpful and kind. Always working with you to solve problems, seems like she really cares about people. The place is easy to access they give you a code</Text>

This was my first time renting a storage so I had little information. Once arriving at the location I was greeted by Noemi and Kathy. I began to tell Noemi that I was looking for a place to store my stuff. She went into detail about the different units they had and asked about the items I would be storing so that she can assess which option would be best for me . Noemi made the whole experience as simple as possible while always looking out for what was best for me . She offered me a great deal which I had no idea they had ! She definitely saved me money while getting me a really good size storage. She went above and beyond by personally showing me how to put in my code to enter the building and also for the elevator. I highly recommend this place and Noemi, she was very friendly and informative.< /review>

Exactly what you want from a storage unit. Easy access, carts are always available and the staff is friendly and helpful. With the help of Naomi and Kathy made the cancellation process extremely easy and that is why I will be using this location again when storage needs arise.< /Review>

Had to move units a couple weeks ago and while it could have been a purely stressful day, Anthony's personality and care made the whole experience lighter.  I don't usually do reviews but had to give him a shout out for handling the issues with tact and maintaining a great vibe through out the experience.  Remember I was moving $#!+, I should have been in a horrific mood! Lol. Big shouts to Anthony</review>

This location has outstanding customer service, with Noemi and Kathy going above and beyond for their customers. They're always so welcoming and attentive when I ask for help or information regarding my rental space, they both should be placed under the definition of Patient because they have so much of it and I always leave knowing my space is safe on their watch. Thank you Noemi and Kathy for your hard work and positive attitude, you are truly appriciated.<//Review>

<Text>I generally don't leave reviews but Jose was very helpful so I thought I would, he explained the insurance to me very well and even escorted me to the back where the unit was. Very professional the whole time. I did notice there were only two carts though and people were checking them out. In such a big building it crossed my mind they may be hard to get if I needed one  seems like there would be at least one for every other floor. Otherwise, great experience.< /Text><user_id>107380606204534718034< /user_id></record></dataset><record>

I highly recommend this location for your storage needs, besides the key location, you will find very dedicated staff to offer you the best of what you need. I was fortunate to meet Noemi whom with professionalism and kindness showed me options and help select a 10x7 unit, we’ll taken care by the way. Moving is not fun, It’s so comforting to find people to help you along the way, thanks again Noemi.< /review>

Noemi was my service provider. She was very nice and knowledgeable. So was another provider Jawan. I love the location and cleanliness of this storage facility. The storage unit that I rented was to my liking, it was kept nice and clean. They have all the necessary equipment you can purchase to pack up your belongings and store them safely. They also provide complimentary dollys if you need to store anything heavy and bulky into your storage unit. I liked their restroom, as it too was kept nice and clean. They also practice good COVID 19 measures at this place. I can honestly say that I had a great experience at this place and I would definitely recommend this public storage location, if anyone need a place to store their stuff. 👍🏻</Review>

"Kathy M. was my service provider on my first visit. Kathy is very nice, patient and an informed person. Kathy's coworkers, Noemi M. and Jawan G. were as well. Additionally, this place is conveniently located and Covid 19 measures are in place and being practiced. So far, I really like this location!"< /Text>

It was my first time using Public Storage and Isaac made the process simple, easy and efficient. Compared to other storage places, Isaac delivered top-notch customer service. I’d recommend Public Storage’s service to anyone in the Los Angeles area for safe, fast and awesome service any time of the year. Much appreciation for Isaac & the Public Storage team for being the best go-to storage facility! Cheers to solid service</Review>

This location is great. David and Naomi are super friendly and very helpful. They conduct daily patrols of the facility and the whole location is super clean. They have dolly's and carts you can borrow to help make the move in/out easy. You can use the ramp gate to make the unloading easier but you have to ask the desk to open it for you. Overall it was a great experience and I would definitely recommend this location</review>

She allow me to take some of my stuff before  the 10 minute lockout since being a new customer I wasn’t aware. I recommend 10/10 for any storage needs.

<Review>Clean and convenient. Excellent service!  Stefany helped me and took all the time necessary - the unit I had reserved was too small for what I needed but she showed me several at the next size and let me pick the one I liked best. She was positive, patient, professional. Also, they do daily security checks on the locks of all units.</Review></record></dataset><record>

<rating>5</rating><text>I went in this past Sunday to rent out a storage and Jasmine was super helpful. She was friendly, informative, and guided me step by step on renting the storage. I wasn't 100% sure which size I wanted to rent out so I was taking my time and she didn't rush me at all. She told me to take all the time I needed to think and choose. If you're ever in the area looking to rent out in a public storage, go to this location and look for Jasmine!<//text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x80c2bba0c490b3cb:0xf3b9f88b5161f0b3< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Great experience! Everyone here was very helpful and nice, and they were effective with getting me in and out as quick as possible. I had a specific situation and they explained the contract to me thoroughly so I understood how things worked for me. Noemi and Stefany are amazing!<//text>

Units are well kept. Staff is always friendly and attentive. When I first moved in, I had an issue with the door of my storage unit. Within a couple of days, they replaced the door and it included an upgraded hinge for the lock, which added security for the unit.  Should I need a storage facility in the future, I would use them again.<//review>

<text>Just moved out of this space today after being there for 6 years. The facility was always clean and well lit and the staff has always been professional. Raelyce who works the front desk is an absolute sweetheart...very kind, helpful and patient. Thanks for great customer service all these years. I definitely recommend this location if you need a storage unit.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

I've been using this storage for about a year now and Noemi is by far the best manager to work with I've had the pleasure to interact with and Jawan has also been great since he came in a little while ago. Always helpful as is the guy he usually works with whose name escapes me right now.

I highly reccomed this site if you are in need of space as the staff really goes the extra mile.

Thanks for all the help guys.
, Noemi
Plus I like their names, Noemi reminds me that Steve Tisch at Escape Artists movie productions has No Emmy Award, something Lorne Michael's, Ellen Degeneres,  Adam McKay and Will Ferrell as well as Joel Silver like to remind him of on a regular basis and Jawan reminds me of the movie Jawanna Man, a movie my ex worked  on.<//Review>

i didn't end up renting at this facility because it turned out to be too far a trip every day, but I was tempted because the staff are so knowlegable and nice.  Noemi really bent over backwards to find me what I wanted and like I said if it wasn't too far away I would have rented it for YEARS!!!<//Text>

Raelyce was the sweetest and most helpful to my family, I was in a hurry at first and she let me come back when it was easier for me, she also took us up to the seventh floor (her favorite) to show us better storage units. Such efficiency and always with a smile on her face. Great service!</Review>

<Text>This lady told me "I told you we are closing the gates at 5:45". She was about to lock us in the storage and she was aggressive and mean.
No respect to people..if you r reading this people, wait until everyone leave the storage..worst experience with that lady. Get people that are nice and fire her!!</Text>< rating>

Arturo is amazing - his customer service skills are stellar! We had a really difficult situation. Arturo patiently listened and then helped us through it all - recommended our options, answered all of our questions, and processed the transaction we elected to pursue. Highly recommend this location thanks to ARTURO!< /text>

The location is clean and nice. The service is good as well. My original locker had a leakage, and they helped with moving it to another one.< /review>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>The facility is clean and well run.  Veniece and Renisha are always helpful at the desk and really know their stuff.  They were great about helping us find the right plan to save some money and made returns of materials (we didn't use all the boxes we'd bought) easy.  It's been great every time I go to the storage unit.< /Text>< Pics>

I have enjoyed my visit at this public storage. An employee named STAR has taken out time to thoroughly explain the process of starting with Public Storage. I thought it was going to be confusing. However, with her positive attitude and patience all my questions were answered with ease. Thank you so much. This employee has set the standard on how customer service should be like!<//text>

<text>This location doesn’t even deserve one star. I was lied to and swindled consistently by the staff. The charged me an extra month when all I needed was one more day to get my stuff out. Arturo told me it would be fine to come in the next day (the 1st), to finish getting my last few items because they wanted to close for the day. I went back the next day and he himself told me that’s not the case and that I had to pay for another month, no exceptions. After all was said and done, I got a call from their corporate office who was still trying to bill me for a space I had vacated weeks ago (yet another blunder).  I then alerted their office of how inappropriate this was, especially considering how badly I was treated and why I moved in the first place. Thy wanted to know what happened, and I told them the last straw was that Arturo told me I had to pay for another month no matter what, after his promise otherwise. And the corporate employee told me that’s not true, and that they pro-rate people for late check outs all the time. Funny, when I called corporate to find this out, no one ever got back to me. No attempt to help me. They then had another manager try to get in touch which me about some sort of resolution...something I never asked for since I’d given up on their help long before that. But he only called me once, in the middle of the work day when I can’t possibly stop to handle this type of conversation. This company lies about the lies they tell. Please do yourself a favor and never let anyone you know rent at this location.</text>< user_id>

Raelyce gave me the best experience in my trying times. She made my transition and information such an easy experience that I am thoroughly impressed. Human beings like this are hard to find. Employee to customer experience is a very difficult thing and she handles it like the professional she is. Thank you very very much for the great experience.< /review>

Great facility, clean, great staff, just overall construct of public storage is a horrible rip off, if you pay for a unit they will not give you a refund to your payment source instead you wait (I am still waiting) on a reimbursement check. There is also not a pro-rated rate if you stay after the first, so you must hurry up and move all of your items and not pay. I over paid also by billing error after they did not send receipt. Still working on it to get reimbursed. The automated call system makes my skin burn the amount of work it takes to get to a live correspondent is unbelievable.< /review>

Great customer service.  Both Stanley and Thylicia were friendly and helpful.  They made my 1st visit a good one.  Good location with parking and easy drop off.  I'm a very happy customer. Special thank you to Stanley for working with me to find the best deal.< /text>

Raelyce and other staff are very helpful, but location is under staffed and office is constantly closed. There are two elevators but only one of them seems to work—on busy days expect long wait times going up AND down. Beware of the “helpers” that hustle outside, they can be hit or miss—if you smell alcohol or other things on them best to say no thanks... trust.</text>

Do yourself a favor, reserve a storage unit HERE!

Not only does it include amazing customer service by friendly, professional staff but it's also an affordable price for LA in a navigable location. Don't forget the convenience of managing your account online while having a flexible month to month contract :)

Obviously everyone knows that moving is stressful. My move was especially stressful, not because the fact I was moving from San Diego, but everything that you think could and couldn't go wrong...went wrong. From broken boxes from accident prone movers and sitting in traffic with empty gas tanks to wrong keys by missing landlords and ruined newly bought furniture and mishandled sentimental belongings- I begged the day to be over and naturally I dreaded my last stop:storage. It was heaven- the exact opposite of how my day was going.
Seriously I'm considering to believe in angels because when I went there, I easily spotted and found parking right away. I was greeted sincerely and helped right away! They worked with the movers and everything was stored and moved unbelievably smoothly! Words cannot express my gratitude and satisfaction. Thank you so much Stanley and Yesenia, I highly recommend you to go to this Public Storage unit!!<//Text>

Athea is amazing. She helped me fit a whole studio move set of boxes plus 25 more items into my tiny convertible and I had no idea how I was gonna get it all home. I was prepared to call an uber to transport boxes but her engineering skills saved the day. Noemi was pretty awesome too. Super helpful dynamic duo. Best public storage experience eva!

Had an awesome experience! Made an appt & had to postpone. Arrived ontime at the new appt. Staff was ready. Got an immediate tour of the unit I requested. Straight down to paperwork. I was contracted and out the door in 20 minutes. Now that is awesome speed & service. I'm impressed.< /Text>

<text>Raelyce and Jared were so pleasant and helpful.  My account was set up with so much incorrect information (at another location), and I was extremely close to unknowingly losing all my items because PS had incorrect info and was unable to contact me. Raelyce and Jared helped me clear everything up and made a difficult situation feel much safer.  Their customer service and willingness to help was greatly appreciated.  Didn't expect to receive such amazing service. And so happy that they helped me quickly resolve my situation.  THANK YOU!!!</text><userid>106953212833820102718<//userid>< Rate>

I would definitely recommend this Public Storage to others. Stanley has been incredibly helpful on multiple occasions. One time he helped me move in for 45 minutes after closing, and another time he helped me resolve a late fee my account got dinged with unwarned. The customer service here is through the roof, above and beyond the call of duty. Thanks!<//Text>

Do yourself a favor, reserve a storage unit HERE!

Not only does it include amazing customer service by friendly, professional staff but it's also an affordable price for LA in a navigable location. Don't forget the convenience of managing your account online while having a flexible month to month contract :)

Obviously everyone knows that moving is stressful. My move was especially stressful, not because the fact I was moving from San Diego, but everything that you think could and couldn't go wrong...went wrong. From broken boxes from accident prone movers and sitting in traffic with empty gas tanks to wrong keys by missing landlords and ruined newly bought furniture and mishandled sentimental belongings- I begged the day to be over and naturally I dreaded my last stop:storage. It was heaven- the exact opposite of how my day was going.
Seriously I'm considering to believe in angels because when I went there, I easily spotted and found parking right away. I was greeted sincerely and helped right away! They worked with the movers and everything was stored and moved unbelievably smoothly! Words cannot express my gratitude and satisfaction. Thank you so much Stanley and Yesenia, I highly recommend you to go to this Public Storage unit!!< /Review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>Got to the storage unit early and the staff was welcoming. Kelsey, a manager i believe, came back from her lunch a bit early to help me out. In order to help her coworker, Raehice(?), go on her lunch. Very helpful, friendly, and accommodating both of them. I reserved a storage until too small for my stuff so Kelsey helped me find the right thing for my situation. Letting me know about the special deals i was available to gain, as well as patiently going through the electronic paperwork. While she explain everything clearly, she answered any complicated questions i had. In the end, the experience went very smoothly. We had a friendly conversation, which is refreshing because good casual customers service isn’t everywhere. I helped them practice their spanish a bit haha. Moving is always a hassle so it helped my mentality being helped so well on a rainy day. They opened the orange roll up doors so we wouldn’t need to move the moving truck. A dolly was available for use, as long as an ID is given. There’s also a restroom in case of any long moving days. Thanks again ladies!</Review>< Pictures>

<userid>117349457222918160606<//userid><Review>This turned out to be the worst experience of my Life.  I had a storage for over TEN years because my place is small and I don't have family here.  I fell behind during layoffs.... Public storage rightfully sold my items.  I did lose them.  What is heartbreaking is my Birth certificate, social security number, medical files, other medical info from a former Business were given to the buyer after Kamisha Quall Promised me she would not allow the buyer to take my personal items.  Nobody watched him take the things.  I received a call from Venice at the location stating, "The man came down and said he only took sixty percent of your stuff."  He had almost ALL and only left junk.  He took ALL my clothes, including private Fraternity wear that will cause problems for anyone wearing it in public and not being a member.  My Grandmother and Mom pictures, family Memories that I can't get back.  Julie Turner from the Corp office got the buyer on the phone to see if he would sell the items back to me, at whatever cost.  The interpreter who spoke to this non-English speaking person said, "He don't want to sell it back to you.  My HEART dropped, he knows what he took.  How can someone assist a potential criminal.  Cristina at another Public Storage place said she knew the man, he is a regular there, and she tried calling but had to stop helping for fear she would be reprimanded by Kamisha.  This is so sad.   Thanks Public Storage, I feel like I can't go on.<//Review>< user_name>

<Review>I called to inquire about a storage space for my mother and Dawn was very helpful and made an appointment for me to come see the space. I arrived 30 minutes before closing on a Saturday with my mom (who is a senior citizen) and Dawn and Brittany took so much time with us and were both patient and knowledgeable. Dawn knows Public Storage's policies like the back of her hand. She answered all of my mom's questions and explained EVERYTHING including the vague insurance requirements. We secured the space and they even let us linger after closing to put a few things in our unit that we'd brought along in the car. My mom said it was so nice to encounter such professional and courteous young people. Thank you Dawn and Brittany for your help and kindness.</Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x80c2bba0c490b3cb:0xf3b9f88b5161f0b3< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>Moving is not fun and just getting started is tough enough.  It was really cool to walk into the Crenshaw location however and be greeted by two completely friendly and helpful people.  Stanley helped me with boxes...POLITELY reminded me of other things I would need to pack and also told me about the return policy.  He asked if I needed temp storage  (I do not) and essentially covered all bases.  He even insisted he help me out with my boxes to the car.  Juliann was also friendly and fun.  It was just a nice environment to walk into and you could feel the good energy.  Thanks Public Storage.....you made the first part of this so much easier and I know I'll be back.  Kind Regards,  Doug</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<Review>Good storage facility; great staff at the front desk. The two women who signed me up, Desiree and Raysa, were so wonderfully helpful and informative; Desiree answered every question I had, and Raysa stayed late to make sure I was able to move all my belongings in.

However, the hours here are terrible. I often have trouble getting here. I sometimes feel as if I pay this place way too much money to just occasionally drive past my stuff and wave at it.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

This company is a joke. They change staff and district managers like socks. The convience of the location clashes with the unconventional business hours. Most staffers are trained to be just as shady as the owners.  Save yourself the trouble and go with a mom & pop especially if this location is on your option list. My experience at this location was a very poor reflection of past experiences with company in other states. Everytime I was there someone was in line complaining-95% of the time there is only 1 staffer 2 service everyone. not sure how they have such high stars. Something is fishy.</review>

After having many bad experiences with storage, (those who have experienced marketing tactics coupled with bait & switch, or the additional cleaning fees, processing fees, statement fees, additional insurance etc, ya’all know what I’m talking about!)...I spent hours researching storage online, I decided on a unit that fit my needs and my budget...I was armed with information and a confirmation number and marched in with my demands. I was greeted with a warm welcome and the sweetest smile. RaeLyce was very professional and to my surprise she suggested I view the unit prior to taking my money.  The unit was ideal since i have a disability and needed ground floor access. My bad, it was too tiny once I looked at it. Raelyce spent ten minutes trying to find another unit on the ground floor to no avail.  Instead of offering a unit twice the size for my needs with a kazillion dollar monthly fee, she sought help from a seasoned co-worker Vanessa, Vanessa strolled over with a hospitable smile and said if you give us just a few moments we will do everything we can to make you happy. I noticed it was ten minutes to closing for them and wasn’t expecting these two young woman to do more them discus how to get out on time. I held my breath knowing I was going to get stuck with a house sized unit once they delivered their tag-team sales pitch... to my astonishment, 20 minutes later they rushed back smiling, beads of sweat running down their faces. These woman went above and beyond to help empty and clean a unit that was being vacated as we spoke. It was scheduled to be cleaned the next day.<//Text>

<text>This place always has issues. Hope I had something nice to say about this business and it's location but every month we stop by to check our unit and make a payment and we never leave happy how we arrive. They need to have more than just one person there. One staff member isn't enough. We have called Public Storage directly numerous times to complain about this. Last we were there we we're locked out of their facility with about 10 yes 10others for a good hour, with no one on the premises. After I called and complained, a location manager drove up maybe 20minutes later, never said a word to anyone one of us who obliviously had been waiting to be let in. She just unlocked main doors and went into the lobby. Very unsatisfied with their service.</text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None< /Response><rating>1< /rating>< gmap_id>

Don't let them fool u that u get $1 first month rent, because it does not happen if you rent near the end of the month you get ripped off. I was told that but when the new month rolled around I was told that I would need to pay full fare. And if you have a problem don't ask for the District mgr( Brett Winslow) because you will receive no help and where do I start, unreasonable, absurd, and down right rude. I would stay away from this Public Storage and very much away from the district manger. There are no lights in each units so you will need to bring your own light.

The sales staff there is great and will help out with anything you need but watch out for Brett</text>

<GmapID>0x80c2bba0c490b3cb:0xf3b9f88b5161f0b3< /GmapID><Pics>None<//Pics><Text>(Translated by Google) It has many units, in its 8-level building, with access to two elevators, which allow you to access only the level of your unit, take into account that sometimes the elevators will be saturated, The same happens with the use of the devils (wheelbarrows) of the place.
With parking, have even more patience, since due to its location and its lot it only has seven parking spaces for small vehicles. And hopefully a little truck. So do not dare to go with a big truck as you will have many difficulties.
In this place there have already been robberies in units from one to several units at the same time, of which its personnel do not realize the theft until the end of the day, which leaves many doubts with the personnel who were in moment, which were fired or transferred to other warehouses.
So do not have the highest security of your belongings, so refrain from leaving valuables in the place.

(Original)
Cuenta con muchas unidades, en su edificio de 8 niveles, con acceso a dos elevadores, los cuales te permiten acceder únicamente al nivel de tu unidad, toma en cuenta que algunas ocasiones estarán saturados los elevadores, Lo mismo sucede con el uso a los diablitos(carretillas) del lugar.
Con el parqueo ten aún más paciencia, ya que debido a su ubicación y su lote tan solo cuenta con siete estacionamiento para vehículos pequeños. Y con suerte u  pequeño camión. Así que no te atrevas a ir con camión grande ya que tendrás muchas dificultades.
En este lugar ya se han dado robo en unidades desde una hasta de varias unidades en el mismo momento, del cual su personal no se dan cuenta del robo hasta el final del día, lo cual deja muchas dudas con el personal que se encontraba en es momento, los cuales fueron despedidos o transferidos a otras bodegas.
Así  que no cuentes con la mayor seguridad de tus pertenencias, por lo cual abstente de dejar objetos valiosos en el lugar.<//Text>< user_name>
