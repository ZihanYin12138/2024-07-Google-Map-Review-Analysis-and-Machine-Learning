5 stars doesn't do this place Justice.  I searched high and low for the perfect olde.  I kept going back to arys site.....mind you, I've never met Ary a day in my life, and I live  across the country in New York. My bf and I drove Ary crazy for almost a year (although Im 100 percent sure Ary wont admit that....love u Ary) until I finally saw a picture of the dog I wanted. Ary was awesome over the phone and via messenger, helping us along the way, and understanding our craziness. I mean it, I've never met such a patient man!!!!! A week later, our healthy olde English bulldogge was flown over to us in a brand new travelling crates, up to date on shots, food for the first month until we adjusted him to a brand of our choice. We got home very late that night from the airport and Ary still picked up his phone right away when we called him with questions.  A year later, and he still answers his phone right away when we call......he is such a knowledgeable breeder and TRULY cares about all of his dogs whether they are still with him or have been placed with a family, calling his establishment a puppy mill is truly a low blow....he runs an operation like I've never seen, even here in New York. It takes a beautiful soul to do what he does with the love that he has.  So, thank you Ary for making my little family complete with Tyson the bison, the sweetest bully I've ever had the pleasure of loving.  You are amazing!!!! If ur looking for an olde, do yourself a favor and contact Ary, you will not be disappointed in the least bit! Xo<//review>

Very helpful and knowledgeable. When you buy a dog here you join a community family of past and current dog owners willing to help. We traveled a long distance to pick up our puppy and Ary invited us to stay on the property over night. We were able to meet and spend time with our puppy prior to the long trip back home< /Review>

<Text>I've known Ary for many years, and work closely with him and his puppy buyers in my line of work as a dog trainer. Ary is a breeder who puts utmost priority into his dogs and breeding program. His clients have lovely dogs that are fun and easy to train, which speaks volumes to their genetics and quality. Highly recommend!< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< userid>

We recent added a four legged fur sister to our family from One of a Kind Bulldogs. She is wonderful and Ary has been wonderfully helpful. He did everything he could to make sure our transition went smoothly and Dixie was happy in our home. Not to mention fielding and answering all our questions. We have already recommended One of a Kind Bulldogs to many friends.< /Review>

One Of A Kind is just that. The property is the epitome of dog friendly, with a caring staff that loves what they do. We purchased a quality dog with Ary. He makes himself available to his clients 24/7. That is peace of mind. We are already considering a sister pup for our now 1 year old boy! 5 stars for a great breeder, a great business and a great guy!<//review>

I usually don't take the time to write reviews, but in this case, it is an exception. I live in CT and 4 years ago we purchased a puppy from One of a Kind Bulldogs. Back then when I first reached out I received best in class service. Since I could not get onsite to see anything he sent multiple pictures and videos of the puppy we were interested in just for us. He even gave me a Veterans discount. Over the past 4 years we have stayed in touch via Facebook, sharing photos and being a member of his customer community. It truly is a community… Once you are a member you are one for life. That says a lot to me about the business that is being run here. Always professional, helpful and you can easily see how much love and care is given to all of the puppies. I am not an expert at all, but I do know this is a business you can trust and will always be there for you. If I sent him a message right now, 4 years later I would get a quick and professional response and not the typical "hey do you want to buy" something. Best in class, if that is what you are looking for as I was.</Review>

He is truely a great breeder who cares about his dogs! He does everything possible to take care of his dogs and make sure the dog that you get is of the best health and condition. Before he gives you the dog he takes it to the vet and make sure it has all of its shots and is in good health. He also cares so much for dogs that he has a Bulldog Rescue on site too. I also like that if you have any questions or concerns about your dog he is more than willing to help you and answer those questions. I don't know of a better old English bulldog breeder in the area, I have and will continue to give this business as a referral to anyone looking for a quality bulldog.</Review>

We have gotten two rescue dogs through One Of a Kind Bulldogs and have been so impressed! It just so happened that each dog came to us as a second placement after living in homes where they were loved by their humans, but a second dog in the home was becoming increasingly aggressive toward them over time. Of course, only a breeder who truly cares about his dogs would do all of the leg work (pun intended) to find these dogs their fur-ever homes.

The One of a Kind Bulldogs foster volunteer that we have worked with both times has been AMAZING. Trish has such a heart for and natural intuition for matching dogs and people, and of course, a heart for placing dogs in homes that would otherwise be euthanized.

But don't just listen to a human review--what would the dogs say? Well, this week I took advantage of the kenneling service that One of a Kind Bulldogs offers its customers, and it was so neat to bring our dog back to where she came from. I watched her perk up in the car as we got closer, get out of the car and walk right up to the gate, tail wiggling. The owner Ary came out, bent down and lovingly kissed her on the head, and took her off her leash. She looked at me inquisitively, but followed Ary right inside--no collar required. Wow! This is no puppy mill!

I am so impressed with One of a Kind Bulldogs and am excited to refer all of my bulldog-loving friends to them!</Text>

I just purchased my second puppy! Ary is knowledgeable about breeding and genetics. He is committed to preserving quality lines of the breeds. He knows the personality of each dog and puppy.  He is passionate about his rescue as well and strives to make sure that all of the dogs find suitable homes. Ary also has a close knit network of clients from all over the country (and beyond) that communicate regularly via a customer Facebook page.</Text>

<username>bfloss88< /username><Time>1473991322668<//Time><Rating>5<//Rating><text>As the title suggests One of a Kind Bulldogs is truly a one of a kind experience with a one of a kind owner with One of a Kind dogs and a One of a Kind family.

Brace yourself this will be long but if you are serious about finding a beautiful dog and a great experience you'll read.

After losing my last bulldog it took me some time to get another.  After being burned by a few other places, including by the owners of my last, I stumbled upon One of a Kind Bulldogs.

The first thing I noticed in their message was the work, compassion and commitment to all animals especially bulldogs.  I decided to reach out and after talking for a while I was sold.  The whole experience was nothing short amazing.  We worked out the details, which involved getting my dog 1,500 miles to me. A week and a half later I had the most amazing little girl ever.

What I wasn't expecting was the family I would be getting with her.  Ary has set up a network with all of his bulldog families to share photos, ask advice, and get to know one another.  Bulldogs are not an easy breed and it is really nice to have a place to turn with so many experienced owners. I have developed many lasting friendships with many of the other families. It is fun getting to know each other and our beautiful dogs.

Not only is One of a Kind a great place, you are getting the highest quality Old English Bulldog with the highest level of care.  You dont get any of the health issues you get from standard English Bulldogs (I know first hand I've had both).  You get healthy, strong, and amazing Old English Bulldogs.  Its fun to see people's reactions to a bulldog at the top of the trail.  My girl goes on hikes, love to swim, and loves the outdoors. You won't get that with other bulldogs.  But she still has the goofy and lazy moments that make bulldogs so great.

If you question the integrity of One of a Kind Bulldogs take it from me give them a call.  You will see the passionate through their rescue/rehab and breeding work, you will see commitment in their healthy beautiful dogs, and you will see the integrity once you step foot in their world.

You wont be disappointed, I'm not and I guarantee the rest of the One of a Kind family isn't.<//text>< Pictures>

<text>We came across this breeder when researching bulldog puppies, and contacted him to book an appointment to visit.  Ary took the time to ask us plenty of questions to determine if this breed would be a good fit in our lives, with our current dog and living situation.  I truly felt like he cared about who would be taking his puppies, rather than just trying to sell them to just anyone.  Once he realized we were a good fit, he advised us of the sex of the dog he would recommend to get along best with our other dog, and invited us to come visit the same morning.  The kennels are huge, clean, and have plenty of toys to play with, including pools to splash around in. We got to meet the older dogs, including some that he had rescued, and we got to see the puppies.  He is incredibly cautious about handling the puppies and has the utmost concern that they are healthy and kept safe.  Since adopting our girl in January, I've contacted him day and night with questions, and he's always answered within moments.  We recently boarded our girl with him while we were on vacation for almost 3 weeks, and he sent us video updates.  When we picked her up, she was clean, happy, and even more well behaved than when we left her.  Definitely the most consciencious breeder I've come across in many years of being a dog owner.  Highly recommend.</text>< Date>

< Review>
We've gotten two dogs from Ary in the past, Cuddles (a retired breeder) and Charlie (her grandson) And couldn't be happier. The dogs have both been happy and healthy since day one, with no apparent issues either health-wise or socially. Ary himself is a fantastic man and breeder of his dogs, treating them all well and making himself available to his customers (or as we call ourselves, his One of a Kind Family) 24/7 without reservation. He's been a delight to work with and I would DEFINITELY do business again with him in the future!!<//Review>

I'm so happy to have the pleasure of meeting Ary recently through OneofAKindBullDoggs due to my interest in one of his Old English Bulldogs puppies. I emailed him with my questions and he responded very quickly and he took the time to answer all of my questions. He is very knowledgeable about the breed and his dogs. I'm so excited to be adopting a puppy soon into our family!<//text>

<Text>My mother-in-law has two of Ary's dogs. They are both great dogs with wonderful temperaments! They are so full of personality and my kids just adore them! We've stopped by the place quite a few times, often with little to no notice, just to check out the dogs he has and to drop off supplies. The place is always clean and the dogs are very loved.

I can't wait until Christmas when I can get one of Ary's puppies for myself!<//Text><name>Kristi Bahena<//name><resp>None< /resp></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Ary stands out among breeders because taking care of these Bulldogs is truly a passion of his heart! He is so friendly and dedicated to serving his dogs as well as educating his customers. He is there for us, anytime, to give us advice & support when needed- and we bought our dog years ago! The facilities are great, and upon your arrival you are met with an adorable pack of happy pups. Ary also runs a bulldog rescue, which is one of many things that clearly show he is in this business for the love of these Bulldogs and not just to make money. He is a stand-out, sweet man and I would recommend One of a Kind Bulldogs to anyone that asks!<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< user_id>

We could not be more thrilled with our experience and, more importantly, our sweet oldie girl. Even our vet asked for One of a Kind's info because he is so impressed with Pippa.

My two frenchies and my Olde English Bulldogge are all from One of Kind Bulldogs. Ary is a responsible breeder and is always available to answer questions. Once you purchase or adopt a dog you become part of an extended family. I couldn’t be happier with the quality of my dogs. Highly recommend</review>

I met Ary several years ago when he bought his first French Bulldog from me. As a breeder myself I'm very picky about where my dogs go especially when they are being sold to other breeders. I personally visited his home and met all of his dogs. He showed me his entire property and every part of his home. Over the years we have become very good friends talking daily. He is a not only a great personal friend but one of the most ethical breeders I know. His dogs receive top quality vet care and eat only the best foods, I know because we use the same vet and we feed the same foods! He is a true dog lover and put the health and wellbeing of his animals above all else. For someone to leave him a fake review saying his dogs are caged and abused is ridiculous. He runs a rescue and also will board customers dogs with a huge portion of his clients being return customers!! I think that says a lot about the type of person he is. I would give him 10 stars if I could!!!! I highly recommend him if you are interested in a quality dog or puppy. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

<Text>As a first time dog owner I was very diligent, to the point of being obsessive about doing my homework. One could even say I got a little obsessive; I read almost everything I could get my hands on, spoke with countless people, and visited a number of breeders. I drove 8 hours to meet Ary, his puppies, and their parents. In my experience you will not find a better, more caring, professional breeder of OEB’s anywhere. Go see for yourself. My guy is three years old, he is healthy, strong as an Ox, and I am constantly getting compliments on his temperament.  I have recommended One of Kind Bulldogs to more people then I count.</Text>< pictures>

I can't put into words how incredible Ary and One of a Kind Dogs have been for my husband and I. We got the love of our life Walter from Ary and not only did he breed a perfect dog with the greatest temperment, but he has been there for every text and every call and question we had along the way. He made it so easy to approach him and you genuinely feel the love from all his dogs. Thank you for making my first experience with a dog the very best!< /Text>

Ary works hard to eliminate any potential flaws so that lines are clean, healthy and athletic.  I have taken two OoaK pups, one from rescue, and they are great dogs. And of course it is worth mentioning that all of Arys fur kids are kept in huge yards with shade tarps, dog houses, toys to crawl on and chew on, premium grade food and supplements, and all day constant hands on human interaction.  I'm quite certain they live better than I do.< /review>< Pictures>

I have always had dogs, loved all breeds. 5 years ago, I got my first and only Olde English Bulldogge from Ary. I named him Bentley. He is the smartest dog I have ever had. Ary's passion for his dogs and dedication to them is undeniable. He cares for the dogs and his customers. His reputation is 5 stars.</text>

Ary is the most amazing, caring, passionate, and animal loving person I know! He dedicates his whole life to these dogs and he loves every single one of them and treats them with care and makes sure that they all go to good homes. This is not only a business for him, it's his life! He answered my questions promptly, on time, even after we took our baby Dex home he still kept in touch and if we ever needed guidance he was there to help! As I said, I have never met with someone so dedicated and caring as him! If anyone tries to tell anything different, they lie! There are a lot of self centered, jealous people out there who just can't see others succeed and they should be ashamed for trying to ruin someone's outstanding reputation!</review>

We had a tough time dealing with the loss of our two boxers that we had for many years. My husband and I talked it over and looked into a bulldog. We found Ary at One of a Kind Bulldogs and called to talk about them. He instantly asked us to come out to his place and discuss the dogs. He informed us of good and bad about the breed and we fell in love. He takes rescue bulldogs with an open heart and gets them ready for their new home. We almost got one but our old dog needed a puppy to mother. We toured his entire property and saw our puppies mother and how amazing the place was. We now have Hamilton who just turned 1 in July. He is the most amazing thing EVER!!!  We love him so much and our family is full again. Ary helps us with any questions and suggestions that we ask. I will be getting another One of a Kind Bulldog someday and am so excited to see what joy our next one brings. I would recommend Ary and this place to anyone!!!  Thank you Ary for all you have given my family!!!<//review>

My husband and I found Ary and One of a Kind Bulldogs almost 2 years ago when we purchased our little guy, Bert. From the very beginning Ary was so helpful and let us know the minute one of his pups was available for purchase. My husband and I made our way down to his place and we were so thrilled to see how happy and well cared for his dogs are. The mom of our pup was so friendly and it showed how much love Ary has for his dogs. He was even talking about how he knew it was the last time he would breed one of his girls - that to me showed how he is not in this business to produce as many puppies as he can, but to treat these animals right while providing a quality product for his customers. He even adopts out his dogs to loving families and has a rescue fund for bulldogs in the area. After we got our dog Ary was always there to answer any questions we had about raising a dog and always gave us great advice. He also has a customer appreciation party every year! We have recommended him to many friends of ours and plan on getting our next pup from him one day!< /text>

My husband and I were looking into getting an old english bulldogge, we did alot of research from calling many breeders to searching the internet. We already had a Victorian Bulldog and we wanted to add to our family. We came upon Ari at One of a Kind Bulldog. We asked  many questions to Ari and his answers where spot on. Since our little bundle was not ready to be released from her mom at the time, Ari sent us videos so we could watch her progress and kept us up to date with her. When she was ready she was flown to us and Ari was in contact with us the whole time. Everything went as planned. We received a beautiful healthy happy puppy. When we are ready for our next addition, Ari will be the only one we will be doing business with. Thank You Ari for all you do.<//Text>

<Text>We got our boy Bentley 4 years ago from Ary at One Of A Kind.  Our experience with him has been phenomenal!  He loves his dogs and they love him.  The kennels are well maintained and clean.  Sometimes when we go on vacation, we go 60 miles out of our way to drop Bentley off at One of a Kind.  Bentley is always so excited to see Ary and when we come to pick him up he doesn't want to leave.  If you want an Olde English Bulldogge or Frenchie, I recommended you go to One of a Kind.<//Text>< Resp>

Ary is a great breeder and takes wonderful care of his animals. It is obvious he cares about his dogs and about the homes that they go to.

My husband and I surrendered our Frenchie, who we loved and adored, but who had become overly aggressive. We trusted Ary to take care of our Riley boy, knowing he would find him a great home.

Ary is always there for his customers. I have texted him numerous times asking questions and he always replies.

I highly recommend One of a Kind Bulldogs for your next dog or for your rescue needs.<//review>

We had been in contact with Ary at One of A Kind for about 6 month before we were ready to bring home a puppy. We asked to come to visit him to see his dogs and his ranch, and he was more than happy to show us around and answer all of our questions as first time dog owners, without any kind of pressure about choosing his dogs.
Since bulldog breeds can come with some health problems we did a lot of research, and looked up a lot of breeders, and One of A Kind was the last one standing. Ary really knows this breed and he produce amazing, high standard and healthy bulldogs, I would never recommend anyone else than him. We felt so safe and well informed when it was time for us to pic up our puppy. Whenever we have questions, big or small, Ary always pics up the phone to answer. He even has a customer board online where his customers can share information, pictures and advices. Its a wonderful way to stay updated on Hedvigs siblings and all other beautiful pups from Ary.
The best decision we ever made was to chose One Of a Kind Bulldogs, we absolutely adore our little girl!< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

When I was looking for an OEB I called a handful of breeders, first closer to me in Michigan of course. I then found One of a Kind and called to talk to Ary about a few puppies I liked, his experience, etc. Ary spoke to me for almost 2 hours. He impressed me with his passion  and commitment to breeding and rescuing dogs. I flew out to San Diego a few days later to pick up my sweet little "monster" Moxie. She's such a beautiful dog and has so much character. Ary, 1.5 years later, is still responsive if I have any questions.  I would recommend anyone looking for a top quality breeder of oeb and French bulldogs to call and meet Ary and his puppies. His dogs are well kept, have plenty of room, are socialized and well behaved. He loves his dogs and treats his customers very well.< /review>

<text>Ary is absolutely amazing. We got our olde english from the rescue part of the company. We saw her online and she looked perfect for our family. Ari took the time to speak to my husband about any concerns about her adapting to our home abd getting along with our other pets.  After speaking to him, we knew that she would work out. Fast forward four years and we love th heck out of our dog. She': amazing with our daughter, any child she meets, our older dog and our cats.

I love that Ary keeps in contact with the owners of his dogs, does annual get togethers and is always available.  We're always sure to recommend him and know that we will be a repeat customer.<//text>< pictures>

I recently purchased a dog from Ary, and have been extremely pleased with the dog and the ongoing service.  This experience ensures that I will not ever be purchasing from another breeder.  Ary has always been available to answer any questions I have ever had about my dog at anytime of the day.  I live in Texas and when I picked up my new pet he was healthy, smelled great, and had a great temperament... At the time I had a new born and my dog was not getting the attention he needed, so Ary, being the great caring breeder he is paid to have my dog brought back to him and he replaced him in a home that was best for him and also let me keep my credit to purchase when I was ready... If that doesn't tell you the type of breeder he is or the passion he shows or the amount of time he puts into his work I don't know what does...Anyone who says otherwise is a damn liar and there is no way they purchased a dog from One of a Kind or ever visited the site or spoke with Ary... Feel free to email me for verification!!! Great job Ary!!< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures></record></dataset><record>

<text>Ary is a great guy who truly cares about his pups & is passionate about this breed.  My pup is six months now, and I could not be happier.  When you get a pup from Ary, you're introduced to a family (of quality OEBs).  I love that he maintains the private customers fb group where we get to see progress from all the other pups, and get advice/help 24-hours a day.  This backbone system is extremely helpful as a first time OEB owner.  I was hesitant to get my pup from Ary with him being in California and me in Texas, but I'm glad i trusted my gut and the awesome reviews here & on yelp.  The process was so easy, and rewarding.  Thank you for working with me Ary.  I love this beautiful dog to death & plan on getting a Frenchie in the future.  I'm blessed to have found one of a kind bulldogs. :)<//text><time>1474034001641</time>< Pictures>

Our journey with Ary started 3 years ago...we put our deposit down for a puppy that the parents hadn't even bred yet. When it was time for us to pick out our puppy my husband had just gotten laid off. So we couldn't get one out of the litter we wanted. I called Ary to let him know what had happened. He was very understanding about it. Said to let him know when we liked another pup and could get one. A year or so later he called us to let us know about this great litter that had just been born. We instantly got online and picked out our little girl. He is very knowledgeable of the breed and knows what he's doing. He truly loves his dogs and doesn't breed them just for the money. He breeds because he loves the breed and the dogs. I have called and have sent him millions of texts for any questions I have, whether they are little ones or big ones he always answers them. We chose to breed our dog that we got from Ary and used studs of his twice. He helped me the entire way with anything that I needed or had questions on. The second time we bred her we actually drove 13 hrs down to California. His set up is amazing! And how he runs things is second to none. I am truly happy that Ary is who we got our dog from and that we didn't choose someone else. Thank you Ary for all you've done for us and all of your help!!</text>

Do not deserve even a star. They upcharged me for a tire they didn’t have in stock, took 2 plus hours to have it delivered and then when the car was finally finished after three hours plus the balance was way off. My g/f wanted to supporter a local business but never again this place. Keep in mind there were no other cars in any of the bays... it was a debacle MUST TO AVOID.< /Review>

<text>I brought a used Miata in for a pre-purchase inspection and they gave me a list of what was wrong with it. I shopped around their quote and their prices are competitive with shops in Vallejo and Sacramento. Since they are just down the block from my house and I had a good feeling about the owner, I had my work done there. It was done well and I have had no further problems.< /text>< Pics>

Don't waste your time at this company. They don't even deserve a star. The management is trash and don't know how to communicate. Save your money

Also I'm not being vengeful, I'm sharing my experience, funny y'all mention "vengeful" is there a reason my last check which was deposited last week was stopped or frozen by you guys... Can you explain that???</Review>

My truck was due for oil, alignment, & a few filters. Despite short time crunch and the shop being busy the folks at this shop were able to send my truck home by closing. I noticed some bad reviews on Google and it makes me think about how some people go into service establishments looking for a problem to complain about from second #1. The folks here got stuff done fast despite being busy at drop off, prices were pretty reasonable and they were friendly. They've been in the neighborhood for years, it's always good to support shops that have been in the city for a long time.< /Review></record>

I called to get a price on tire chains and he gives me a rate. I asked is that the rate on all the cars, because the places I have called asked for tire size or make/model of car. His response was if you want me to sit here and go over all that and something else rude like he didn't want to do his job. I do not have time for rudeness from people who should have appropriate customer service during these hard times. I will NEVER step foot in that store.<//Review>

They have high integrity: They will turn down work that they don't think is necessary, saving you money (three or four times I've asked them to change tires or break pads, and they've said I didn't actually need those services yet). Their prices are the best you'll find. They'll often do helpful favors for free. They're fast (usually faster than they quote they will be) and friendly. Highly highly highly recommend. So sad I don't live near them anymore.</Text>< GmapID>

<Text>So I tried their coupon for an oil change. I called the day ahead to see if I could make an appointment so I would not have to wait and they said that would be fine. I brought my car and asked since I had an appointment for how long. They then inform me that an appointment did nothing for you and they are first-come, first-served. Why not tell me that on the phone when I called???? So I was told it would take 60-90 minutes. Okay, longer than I wanted to wait and why I made an appointment to start but I was already there and my truck needed the oil change. I asked how many techs they had working and they said 2 so I thought they could actually do it in that timeframe. So 75 minutes pass and I walk back by to check in the status and they had not even started my truck yet and also realized that they lied to me and only had one tech working not 2. I was told it would be AT LEAST another hour. Are you kidding me????? Only come here if you can drop off or do not care about your time because they don't!!!!!</Text>< pics>

The statement was actually, "snow tires, no one stocks snow tires in San Francisco because it doesn\'t snow here, let me see if we can get them from the warehouse tomorrow, it might be hard because it\'s the end of the season, do you know the size offhand?"

<Text>I called looking to purchase & install snow tires. The response I got was: “no one has snow tires in San Francisco because it doesn’t snow here.”

Incredibly rude to potential customers. We have taken our business to Big O Tires. They were incredibly helpful, great customer service (when we called they were near closing and very busy but remembered to call us back after hours) and surprise—no snarky comments!

I will never entertain coming to this business again. There are more establishments in the city, in close proximity that I would rather give my money to.

==EDIT==

I'm responding to the owner's comment to my review. The response below is not an accurate reflection of the conversation.

We were not offered to see if it could be order. I had to ask. It was only then that he asked me for information and I said I just wanted a range.

If you'd like to see how customers expect to be treated, please see my review that I wrote for Big O Tires. They were the business we called afterwards and ultimately decided to do business with even though we were quoted something cheaper with you.

Frankly, the tone of the person on the line was not acceptable. And to be clear any human should be offended when any response they are giving assumes they are not unintelligent.

But don't worry, we won't be coming back. :)< /Text>< pictures>

< review>
I came there for my car oil change. The desk man starts aggressively sell me tier change. I have to remind him a few times that I am here only for oil changes. When we finally turned to oil change, the man tried to sell me extremely expensive oil for almost $200. I rejected and asked about the same oil which was used in my car previously. The oil change took more than 2 hours (!)
When the car was ready, the man started to sell me oil leakage diagnostic.
On top of that, the service did tier rotation on my car without any notification.
My husband just came back and surprisingly recognized that the tier have been rotated on the car.
I would strongly recommend to avoid this service for any questions, especially for oil change.<//review>

{'time': 1573836894528, 'text': "We are sorry you felt this way. We are a tire shop, it's our responsibility to inform you of your tires when they are worn. The work order was for the oil change package which included a free tire rotation. There was no notation of it being declined. Sorry we were not aware, most people expect that service since we are a tire store. When doing an oil change and there is leaking we have to inform you of that. Sometime the leak is easily identifiable, sometimes not. When not able to be sourced easily we suggest putting fluorescent dye in the oil to better determine where the leak is coming from. If you do not care for that information, that's fine. Most customers object to having oil leaks, especially on driveways and potentially causing harm to their car. If you don't care for that information that is fine, but allow our people to inform you because they cannot identify who wants or does not want that information."}<//Response>

<Text>Unlike other reviewers,  I had an excellent experience with Jack and would recommend this business.
Sone perspective to hopefully shed light on why others haven't had good luck here:
A. Jack is super freaking busy. In my 10 total minutes spent in front of his desk I saw him help 13 other customers. He is hustling and shuffling and maybe doesn't take time to coddle sensitive clientele.
B. Strange cross section of society happens to wander in here. Sone folks know what they want and are willing to pay to get it done. Others want to bargain,  but this isn't that tote of place. He's too busy to make deals,  and he has high rent,  many people on the payroll, etc. Its a simple decision... this is the price,  YES it NO.
C. Building long term business relationships requires sho owners to be brutally honest even if most people don't like it. I admire this person for doing the best he can to give people honest answers knowing his ratings might suffer in the short term.

Hopefully others will take a chance and help him bolster his reputation after getting stellar service.<//Text>< gmap_id>

< Review>
Went to these guys b/c they were close to where I was. My low tire pressure light came on and I figured I had a nail in my tire. I arrived just at opening and was told it would take about 20 minutes to complete a patch. I asked for a call once my car was done and walked to a local coffee shop to wait; after 30 minutes and no call, I returned figuring my car was done. My car was still on a lift with nobody working on it. I asked the desk person if it was done. The tire could not be repaired due already being patched. Understood and appreciated. She informed me I needed to replace the tire; cost: $290.00.

While I value their decision to not apply a second patch to the tire as this is not safe, I would have appreciated a call letting me know rather than waiting until I returned. Even more important is the fact that my car is all wheel drive. Replacing one tire only would put the differential at risk of damage....and for $290.00.< /Review>

Jack Rhiel super rude, makes no tire repairs and just exchanges for a new tire offered by them, and by the way very expensive, for me a steal, 1 tire almost 200 dollars!  unfortunate when we have nothing to do!  Most expensive place I have ever seen, I still waited a long time with my 5 month old baby and 5 year old son, I hope someday someone will see who is representing this store because I believe it is close to going bankrupt with such a stupid person!< /Review>

I went there for a nail in my tire, they told me that I had to buy all 4 tires so that my car was properly balanced, and my 4 tires have not even 6 months to buy them and they wanted me to buy them 4 for 1  nail in 1 wheel<//text>

Came here to get my flat tire fixed, so I bought a used tire. They put a slashed flat tire on my car as the used tire. When I drove off I noticed my car was driving funny then noticed they put a new flat tire on my car. Then had to stay in the area over night because my tire was flat. The next day they were really rude to me when I complained as if it was my fault. Please choose another place just don’t go here. These guys are probably smoking weed while there working on your car just don’t go here.< /text>

When I got to the place, the look alone made me double guess my decision.  Dirty, unkempt, throw up as you step through the roll up gate.  Once inside, it didn't get better. I decided to take the tire with me to my regular mechanic. At first they said that it was against the law to do so and I had to have it installed there. They then changed their tune, but still charged me for the install.  I called my credit card to dispute this and while on the phone the manager said "just let them know that I have our original conversation recorded".  Not sure what he even meant by that, but besides being creepy, it threw even more shade on an already weird experience.  Will not be coming back!</Review>< user>

Went in to get a very slow leaking tire repaired. I was fine that I had to wait a few hours to have the repair completed. This morning I woke up to find the tire that previously had a very slow leak and was repaired yesterday afternoon to be completely flat. In short, the leak was not repaired and in fact made much worse.</Text>

Over promised and under-delivered... technically not delivered at all. I called ahead and was told it should only take 1-2 hours to get the oil changed on my car. I showed up 5 minutes after I called and nearly 3 hours later (closing time) they hadn't touched my car. I left with a waisted afternoon and no work done. It seems like they could have been a little more honest about how much availability they actually had.<//Text>

I needed an alignment on a Sunday. They were open and close. I read they're reviews, and I must say I was a little nervous. Some are good reviews, some are bad. So I went. I have a rare and modified car ,low to the ground. The manager immediately pulled the car on they're lift, like a champ! Ivan, the technician was knowledgeable, and knows his job. He went over the readout with me, showing how the alignment was off from spec. Job was done in 30 min. It was busy, everyone gets a flat on a sunday, so of course you will have to wait. So I hope this review helps you. And yes,  my car was fixed! No more drift to the right. Give them a shot, Matt VW R32< /review>

SF Auto Care/Mission Tires has consistently charged or quoted me around 50 to 80% more than other shops nearby and the staff have often been less than pleasant on top of that.

I’ll list some examples from my own experience. I live quite close to them, so I’ve tried several times to support their business over the past three years. If you’re planning on shopping here, I’d suggest getting a couple quotes elsewhere as well. If you want to instantly look up a fair price, there are a few websites that are pretty good at doing this based on your zip-code.

Recently I dropped off my mid 2000’s Mazda 3 for a clutch replacement. An hour later, they called me with a quote for $2200. Shocked, I called some other nearby shops and received three quotes under $1250 from other mechanics a few blocks away. Mission Tires also charged me $200 to get me that quote, claiming it was for “diagnostics” which is typically just a drive around the block to confirm a slipping clutch (that most shops will do for free). This isn’t the first time I’ve been charged diagnostic fees here which are often non-existent or much cheaper elsewhere.

When I politely declined the quote, the staff member became sullen, and refused to return my vehicle for most of the day (I was told my vehicle was at their partner shop and no one was free to get it, and I was not allowed to go pick it up myself). I barely got it back in time to take it to another mechanic, and staff’s attitude at that point was quite hostile.

Last year, I had a check-engine light which was caused by a faulty coolant sensor. After an outrageous $700 bill to replace the sensor, the light returned with the same code and they wanted another $100 just to “diagnose” the problem again. I took it elsewhere and had it fixed properly for half the original price.

I’ve had my car returned with the steering wheel covered in grease, and tools left inside the cabin on two occasions. Neighbors and friends who’ve used Mission Tires have shared similar bad experiences of their own, so it’s hard to believe my experience is an outlier.

I can’t say I’ve had trouble with their oil changes and tire service, other than paying a premium compared to what other shops charge. I usually drop my car off in the morning, and it’s done by the afternoon. Since I live nearby, the timing hasn’t been an issue for me.

Unfortunately, I have to rate Mission Tires’ service quite low overall. I’d love to see this neighborhood business correct their issues and be successful. For now, however, negotiating their unnecessary upselling and inflated costs has become too tiring, and I do not plan on returning.<//text>

<Text>Tl;dr: charged me over $1100, didn’t fix the problem that another garage later did in a day, left my car at another garage and made me pay for it, and tried to upsell me more useless repairs to the end, all while treating me rudely.

Had a very disappointing interaction with them - my car had a short, and they not only failed to fix it over two times taking my car in, costing over $1100, they also drove my car to another garage while testing it and forced me to leave work early to pick it up when they insisted I replace the brand new battery before they would work on it again. They charged me $150 for leaving my car somewhere where I had to leave work to pick it up. Ultimately took my car to a better garage, who diagnosed the short in a day (the battery was just fine).

More disappointing to me was the attitude of the staff, who were rude and angry with me when I wouldn’t let them replace the battery (again, turned out not to be the problem). And the final $150 charge for essentially abandoning my car at another garage was just beyond the pale.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

It is funny that a tire shop wont repair your tire and tells you if you keave you will be driving illegally this a big scam he can replace but wont and then your stuck driving illeg on the street.

<text>Got a flat tire on Sunday and took it to this place as it was the closest open place even though I did see the low rating of it on Yelp and Google.  The second phrase out of their mouth was that "if it's a nail on the side, you would have to buy a new tire".  Instead of taking that as an additional clue to get in the car and drive away, I have them the benefit of the doubt.

About three hours later, they called me to say that the tire was "previously patched by someone and they did not do a good job, unfortunately you have to now buy 4 new tires".  So I told them no thank you and went to pick up the car.  They offered to put the spare on and I said yes.  They then charged me $40. Good lesson for me to take the clues when they are right there in front of me.< /text>< time>

Took my car here because it was close to work. Quoted me $1400.00 after a $150.00 diagnostic fee. Phoned sunset service, they quoted me $800.00 for the same repair. I think this guy just relies on drive by's. I am surprised nobodies done a drive by...! Advice don't rely on the naive population of SF & out of towner's. Just be honest, the word gets around Its kinda of small town, but then again that's probably why your shops empty most of the time. You can rip off some of the people some of the time but you can't rip off all the people all the time.<//review>

They were nice and friendly and seemed honest first time I went. Then next time they had my van and said I needed to replace the rear breaks. I told them I couldn't do now but would later. They really insisted that they need to be done. I picked up my van and bought breaks myself and took off breaks and they were more than 50%.<//text>

<user_id>112739588008524524733< /user_id>< Review>
So I had a flat tire on a Sunday morning. I went to a coffee shop and furiously researched new tire options. Both my first (Continental Pro Contact EcoPlus) and second choice (Firestone Precision Touring) were on backorder on TireRack, so I decided to call around local tire shops. When I got Mission Tires on the phone on Sunday noon, a gentleman named Gil assured me he could get a four-pack of the Continental by Monday 11am and get me my car back by Monday night. I was skeptical because the Continental seemed to be on backorder in various places, not just TireRack, so I pointed that out to him, but he checked his system and insisted that he could get them Monday morning. Long story short: three days, >100 miles on the freeway with a spare tire, three apologetic phone calls, and a promise of an additional discount later, I finally drove into Mission Tire's garage on Thursday(!) afternoon to have the new tires installed. Conveniently Gil was not in on Thursday, and no one knew about any discount that I was supposed to receive as an apology. Oh well. When they handed me back the keys two hours later and said thank you, LUCKILY I decided to walk around the car and inspect the tires. One of the four was still an old tire — they had forgotten to change the fourth tire! 30 minutes later, with the fourth tire installed, Mission Tire's and my ways parted forever.

I understand the tire business is very competetive, not least thanks to TireRack & co., but promising availability just to get my business without actually knowing what the availability is, is unacceptable. And please get your act together and use checklists to make sure you don't let your customers drive off the lot with only three tires replaced. It's not rocket science.< /Review>

he lost a customer who was going to fix his tire and buy two new tires from his shop.

<Text>I would give 0 stars if possible. Brought my car in to have the tires replaced because I picked up a screw while driving. When I got my car back there was a large dent in the driver side door which they claimed no responsibility for. Unprofessional, overpriced, and to be avoided at all costs.< /Text>< Pics>

<Rate>1< /Rate><text>(Translated by Google) One of my worst experiences ... Less than a month ago I bought the 4 tires for my vehicle, unfortunately a few days ago they started to give me a problem, which is why I returned to the place so that they could check and verify what was happening since in the purchase I added additional coverage.
My surprise was to take my vehicle on Friday at 11:48 and they said it would be within 2 hours ... they never called me and I had to go to the place to see what was happening ... it was 5 in the afternoon and they didn't they had checked .. To my annoyance they just said that they were busy and the worst thing that their way of solving the problem was CALIBRATING THE TIRES and when asking they said they could not do otherwise. And believe me that they didn't tell me very kindly to tell each other.
My intention is not to discredit this place but to show the reality of their attention and bad service.
I will never return and of course ... I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT

Una de mis peores experiencias... Hace menos de un mes compré las 4 llantas para mí vehículo, lamentablemente hace unos  días empezaron a darme problema razón por la cual regresé al lugar para que ellos revisaran y verificar lo que sucedía ya que en la compra agregué una cobertura adicional.
Mi sorpresa fue al llevar mi vehículo el viernes a las 11:48 y dijeron que estaría dentro de las 2 horas siguientes.. nunca me llamaron y tuve que ir al lugar a ver qué sucedía.. eran las 5 de la tarde y no lo habían revisado.. Ante mi molestia ellos se limitaron a decir que estaban ocupados y lo peor que su forma de solucionar el problema fue CALIBRAR LAS LLANTAS y al preguntar dijeron que no podían hacer otra cosa.  Y créanme eso no me lo dijeron muy amable que se digamos.
Mi intención no es desprestigiar este lugar pero si hacer ver la realidad de su atención y mal servicio.
Jamás regresaré y por supuesto... NO LO RECOMIENDO<//text>< Pictures>

Good all-turf dog park. Separated small and large dog sections. So many dog parks in LA are dust bowls. Nice to have this 'cleaner' one.  Little hills make for a bit of variable terrain in a small space. Benches and water stations are nice features.< /review>

This dog park is a great place for people to bring their pets. There are two separate dog parks, one for large dogs and one for small ones. Each has seating areas for the humans and a water fountain for dogs and water bottles.<//Text>

<Review>Its a nice slice of park in 90069 area with 2  zones dedicated for dogs off leash and to play. There are nice benches to sit on, a large patch of grassed area for humans to relax  on. Some courts for ball games and exercise activity. Situated right next to the local library and across from the Pacific Design Center, it's a much needed community space in this zone.< /Review>< rating>

I love that this park is big and grassy. So many dog parks are just large dirt pits -- this in comparison is lovely. The other dogs and dog owners are pretty attentive and the dogs were well behaved. It can get busy though!< /review>

<username>Larissa Lynn<//username><date>1620085349584<//date><rating>2</rating><text>EDIT 2.

BEWARE !!! there is a couple Whos pitbull is very aggressive. I also have a pit terrier she is only 7 months and the couple let their dog bite and attack not only my dog but other dogs as well. The couple then tried to blame another dog (great dane) that had just showed up as we were leaving. When everyone saw their dog attack other dogs.

Im not sure if they live in the area or not. But they need to be held accountable.

This is an update so I cant add photos from my phone hopefully I will be able to add them later.

Parking is also inconvenient. Park down the street at the store at your own discretion. or pay 20$ at the library.

The park itself has fake grass. Its pretty clean and was decent over all. Everyone elses dogs got along just fine. But Id recommend you bring your own water bottle and toys.< /text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

One of the few dog parks in the area, without any dirt and dust. This park had artificial grass and is open until 10pm. The small and large dog sections are separated by 100 ft, at least. Dog owners are very friendly and informative. This is my go to dog park for our nightly run< /Review>

I have two medium size dogs, very friendly and lovable. Both are about 35 lbs. At first sight, this dog park looks great. It’s all grass turf with, it looks like, man made small hills. There is a small dog park and a large dog park. Both small in sq.ft. Just with the size I was already wary of how packed it can get and how that would probably make dogs feel a little anxious. Anyway, I decided to give it a shot and made a visit at the large dog park a couple of times. The first time I went, it was later in the evening. Closer to 8:30pm - 9:00pm. At this time, there were few dogs and the people I met were nice. The second time I went was on a Sunday, mid day. It was completely packed. People weren’t friendly whatsoever. Not only that, a white chow attacked my dog for no apparent reason. It was fixated on her and the owner’s could’ve cared less. They allowed this to happen and clearly the dog was not disciplined. Sure enough, he bit my dog by her HEAD and no one helped except for one male who was able to pick up my dog when he got the chance. My dog was bleeding on the side of her head and her lip was scratched. I will never be back here again. Overall, this park is small, over crowded during the day with a mean crowd. Don’t go to the dog park if your dog isn’t FRIENDLY. How disappointing.<//Text>

The larger dog section should be a bit larger. Big factor given that it's for big dogs, they need space to run.
They have bags for poop and hand sanny outside the entrance. Good stuff.< /text>

Great place that locals frequent, with seperate areas for small and big digs alike. Don't expect it to be quiet.</review>

Extremely well maintained dog park.  The turf is always clean. Unfortunately, most of the people who come here are first time dog owners with young, untrained pups and many owners do not monitor or pick up after them.<//text>

We'd go (before pandemic) almost every day between 7pm & 9pm with our German sheperd and chihuahua. Almost never had an issue. I just always thought some of the owners/parents need to chill out. It's a dog park. They are 🐕 . They will be fine if they run and play with each other.  They're not suppose to sit and drink tea.< /text>

I really like this park be honest. It was large enough for my pit to run around in. I even met this adorable older lady with her 2 that she called her baby muts. Lol The only thing reason I didn't give 4 star was I think they should shut down the park for a couple of weeks to let the soil soak in all the dogs pee. If you have a sentive stomach or noise it does smell like dog urine pretty bad. What do you expect. Lol It's a dog park.</text>

The place itself is great. The lawn is cleaned once a day, has decent shade, and it's easy to get to. The problem is some of the owners. My dog has been attacked multiple time while playing with his sister. As long as you are on top of your dog is not a problem, but be ready for bad owners that sit on their phone and let their dog cause fights.<//text>

There are two dog parks at West Hollywood Park. One for small dogs one for larger dogs. As my dog is in between, I went to both. In both dog parks, the dogs are very well behaved. Some of the owners, not so much. But overall it was a good place to bring my dog.</review>

Separate off-leash areas for big and small dogs set up within the new West Hollywood Park, right next to basketball courts. Artificial K9 turf is safe for dogs and makes for a green looking park that stays green. Benches, water stations and trees make this a nice spot to spend time in and a super fun place for dogs to run around and play.

Note that large dog park is closed on Wednesdays from 9-10am and small dog park is closed on Wednesdays from 10-11am for maintenance.</text>

My french bulldog FLUFFY loves it here and frankly I feel like she's also bugging me to take me here every day  ( I live in Hermosa)  and I'll make the trip here all the time, but you gotta love the surrounding areas of west hollywood!  Great dog park!< /Review>

<Review>Two separate closures divided by the basketball court; one for small dogs, one for medium & large dogs. There is a good amount of space for the dogs to play along with tennis balls and water fountains in both closures. For the most part, people do a decent job of cleaning up after their dogs, which is nice and crucial for repeat visits. Plenty of seating area for the owners to kick back. The only drawback is some of the regular owners who are a bit overprotective and stand-offish with some of the other dogs/owners. But that's not the fault of the space. Good parking a stone's throw away at the WeHo library parking structure, with the first hour or two free with validation at the park manager's window by the playground.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

This has been my 2nd visit to the vegan pop up with vendors. I love the pizza soo...much cant wait to stop by the following Monday. I also feel in love with the leche vendors who had oat milk alternatives on their drinks. I recommend to just try some of the vendors, leche stand will gladly let you try their drinks before u decide on purchasing.< /review>

<Review>I took my Dads Cat to be Groomed. I told them he could be Combative. They called me to pick up my Cat unfinished as he was too Aggressive. They charged me $85.00 and didn't finish grooming him! They also Cut Him! No wonder he was so Aggressive...he is still shaking and it's the following day. They really traumatized him!<//Review></record>

Because I wasn't able to visit inside and explain to the actual groomer (due to covid), they cut the hair a little more than I wanted. But other than that they did a good job! Their prices are affordable as well.< /review>

The receptionist is wonderful! They really care about your pets. I’m so pleased with their work. Thank you very much!<//Text>< user>

<Text>I love coming here but most importantly so do all my pets!!

Special shout out to Brandon who is a true professional and gives my eldest and largest cat named Martini the most exquisite cut.

Believe it or not the kitty’s behavior change is noticeable after each cut and he is visibly happier, even after shedding his luscious tabby fur. If you have a longhaired feline I highly recommend bringing the beauty here to let Brandon and the rest of the staff give them the type of makeover that reflects the love you have for them.

<Review>I brought my labradoodle, Bailey, into Golden Shears yesterday and i was absolutely thrilled with her beautiful summer hair cut. Brandon usually takes care of Bailey, but he was on vacation. Yvonne took care of her and Bailey came home happy and looking fabulous. I'm so glad I found this dog salon!!!</Review>< Pics>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>I went here to drop off a dog for my client that has an Italian greyhound and they are very fragile and rather wirey but wonderful dogs. He just needed a bath and his nails clipped and general grooming stuff... And I can tell you when he came out from the groomer he was a happy at the dog and that's how I can evaluate how groomers do because they don't all do great grooming but at least if they don't scare the heck out of the dog and they're nice to them and they do what they're supposed to do that sometimes is as much as you can ask but this place went over the top with taking care of this little fragile one and I appreciated that</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

Wonderful! They do a great job, good price, and they even put a cool feather in her hair. I never write reviews but since I have a poodle I need a lot of grooming and I've found golden shears to simply be the best!</text>

I have been taking my dog to golden sheers for years under the prior management. This last time, they forgot to put the feather in. Then they took her in the back and did it quickly. It fell off the next day, but I was going out of town and could bring her back until I returned. I made another trip there to have a new one put on. I got a lecture from the new owner who said I should have brought her in the next day even though I explained I was in a plane! REALLY?!?! If they were smart, they would have apologized for not putting the feather on in the first place, for doing a crappy, rushed job resulting in it falling out the next day (which has never happened before in years) and for the time it took for me to drive back to have it done. Obviously, these new owners know nothing about customer service.<//text>

< review>
The “ladies” on duty today were rude and have no intentions of even trying to help a customer or up-sell.  We asked about sizes of sandwiches and sides while ordering over the phone and were told there weren’t options. Yet later to find there are. That was just the beginning. Avoid . Not sure how there are any good reviews.</review>

<Time>1550327843884< /Time><Rate>5<//Rate><Review>Great food, good prices and very good customer service. This little gem by the Pacific Highway is located a short walk from the USS Midway Museum. We went for a quick morning bite on a Friday and we enjoyed the casual, laid-back, "surfer/Beachgoer" atmosphere of the place very much. Plenty of seats and tables (our table was a surfboard...cool!) A hearty breakfast sandwich, a big chocolate croissant and a cup of coffee came to $15, which is not too bad along this part of downtown San Diego. Recommended!<//Review>< Pictures>

Yess!!! What a perfect sandwich spot. Amazing food. Great service. Ideal location when touring downtown. Parking could be challenging. Great find. We followed our noses and were not disappointed.<//Review>

<text>I have been to beach hut deli, probably  15+ times.  The food is always amazing.  However, recently, the service has been terrible.  The "bar tender" is more interested in what drink she is going to make for herself and the rest of the staff, than actually serving customers. While sitting at the bar I had to refill my water twice from the soda fountain... This is the third time in the last 3 weeks that she has completely ignored a paying customer to either mix or pour drinks for the STAFF!!!  Unacceptable  "customer" service, although I am sure that staff was thrilled...

Food is a 5 star, service is a 1.  In a service industry, unfortunately that drags down the rating more than the food can compensate for....</text>< Pictures>

<text>good food at good prices but as far as the service goes the girls working there are not friendly at all.
It seems that they are either mad at each order or it sucks to work there!
As we were waiting for our food we even heard 3 other customers making the same comment that those girls just could have a better attitude.<//text>< rating>

<Review>Ordered two sandwiches. Asked for one sandwiches to be left dry with a (side) of mustard. After leaving found the sandwich had mustard so thick it seemed like it was put on with a spatula.  It was dripping off & was unable to eat it. For the price of the sandwich it was a complete disappointment!! Explained my order twice to the the one at the counter & still didn't get it right.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

Tiki bar aesthetic, so a totally chill vibe. Great location to grab a bite coming from the beach. The food was surprisingly great! I kind of expected an okay sandwich to get me by, but I was pleasantly surprised. They have gotten creative, and it works. Totally recommend the “shark bite”. Cool mix of flavors and textures!< /Review>

Their acai bowls are fantastic!  Great coffee, great drinks, breafast sandwiches are delicious.  Workers are always friendly and in a good mood.

We always make it a priority to go to the Beach Hut Deli when visiting San Diego!</Text>

<Text>I've been to many small places over the years on vacation that were much busier than this place yet it took more than 30 minutes to get our simple food order. Way overpriced for portions, wife's drink was watered down and my coffee was cool enough to gulp for the first moment. I give props to the staff for being friendly however.</Text><user_id>104983096456902313521</user_id>< time>

This has been my favorite place in Reno since 2007 (the owners play a big role in our local art and music industry) so you can imagine how excited I was to find one when I moved to  San Diego. The price is worth the sandwich, they are healthy and amazing and they hit the spot. This is by far my favorite sandwich shop. I highly recommend the bikini or the cheese steak... but again, everything is amazing.< /text>

It took almost fourty minutes to get our food and it was way over priced for what we got. The salad was good but my sandwich was impossible to eat it was like they just threw pulled pork all over it so I couldn’t pick it up and it was too difficult to eat with a fork. There’s not enough seating so we had to sit at a table covered with empty beer bottles.</text>

<review>My wife tried to order a Large Sunburn with mild wing sauce on the side, but the person taking the order said it's not that hot and the sandwich is better with it on.  So she agreed. The person making the sandwich in back put on super hot wing sauce for what reason we don't know.  Not funny.< /review>< pictures>

<Text>The breakfast burrito was uninspired. Plain egg and avocado in a tortilla. Looked like a microwave burrito when I received it and I waited a long time.

Staff is friendly.

Only salad that didn't include meat was an iceberg salad. Disappointing healthy menu options.

The physical space has potential. It's a sports bar beach bar hybrid feel. Has a TV on outside patio.

Haven't tried the deli sandwiches.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures></record></dataset><record>

They make a pretty good breakfast burrito, however the service too what seemed like forever.  Also, be forewarned that they put cream cheese in almost everything there, so ask first if you have a dairy allergy.  The other nice thing about this place is the outdoor seating with views of the waterfront.< /Review>

The meat in their sandwiches is over the top. The put more meat in than you would at home. Al the sandwiches this place serves are the sandwiches you've dreamed about while high on the best weed. They have a killer beer selection too. Eat here - it will change your life and your standard for what a sandwich is.<//text><user_name>Hayden Bond<//user_name></record>

<Review>Service was terrible and food was overpriced!! No greeting upon arrival,  told to grab  menus and have a seat. 10 minutes went by and no one came by to take order so had to go to counter and order food. Only 2 other customers in the whole place but the workers thought their phones were more important than customer service.< /Review>< gmapID>

The slowest deli in San Diego!!! The first time it took 25 minutes to get my order. The second time I made an online order. I went to pick up my food and it wasn't ready. I waited 10 minutes and they still weren't even started. I asked for a refund, and after another 7 minutes they still couldn't figure out how to do a refund. I was late getting back to work because of them, with no food, and no refund!!! I will never go back to this place!!!< /Text>

<review>My family was staying at hotel next door and we walked to placr an order at deli. As first-timers we asked two questions and cashier knew very little, stating “I think....”. After 40 minutes of waiting for our uncomplicated order (two individual customers were waiting along with us) the cashier re-appeared to poor multiple tap beers, then proceeded to kitchen area where she and other staff consumed them while taking hits on vape pens. This was all in plain view of us and she and I caught eyes more than once. A new staff member came forward and took charge of our order.  I should have demanded a discount or free, as the two others did, but didn’t. Not going back with that staff on duty.< /review><Resp>None< /Resp></record>

<review>I went here a couple times for breakfast while staying at the attached Residence In (which has an extremely busy free breakfast). They have a good breakfast selection, with good coffee options (including a few of the alcoholic variety), bar, outdoor seating, and TVs. Service can be slow, I recommend online ordering if you are in a hurry.< /review>< Pics>

<Text>This may be the best casual restaurant on the waterfront in downtown San Diego. The Beach Hut has all the bases covered: Delicious food, excellent cordial service, comfy atmosphere and prime location.

The sandwiches and coffee are superb. My "Stay Classy" breakfast burrito with sausage, cheddar, avocado eggs etc was super tasty, hearty, hot and filling on a nice breezy morning. I also really like their "Skinny Dipper"(roast beef, cheddar, onions veges au jus). And the big chocolate chip cookies are yummy.

Their Ryan Bros coffee is outstanding and at .50 cent refills an excellent value.

I have been watching the World Cup there(big screens on walls as well as large ones in booths for prime viewing) which has been alot of fun.

Service by manager Brittany and Crew is really outstanding..ranks in my top 10 in San Diego and they really know how to make really amazing sandwiches.

The location is unbeatable facing the water/USS Midway Museum with a nice outdoor lounge to soak up the rays.<//Text></record>

Excellent sandwiches and right on a park/ harbor front so there is nice green space for picnic style if you want it</Text>

<review>So menu looks good. Inventive drinks seem enticing.Staff wasn't present upon walking in. Two young women waiting before us for who knows how long... Drinks we're not made to satisfaction. Don't get your hopes up for a good barista experience? Frappe was crappe. Dirty chai was not dirty.</review><UserId.>114820490631847021862< /UserId.>< Response>

This place is soo amazing! Every sandwich is a winner & an automatic obsession. (But if I had to choose 2: the Surfin Bird and the Woody -toasted are DELICIOUS). The staff is super friendly, helpful and make this soo much more than any deli I've ever been to. Also- you have to try the Green Coffee at the counter connected to it.< /Text>

<review>Desperate to find parking to go whale-watching, we ended up parking at the Marriott (here's a tip - if you're here for longer than 3 hours, like we were, then park at the Amtrak station, it's only $17.  We ended up paying $25 at the Marriott!) - and on the way to the whalewatching, we wanted a sandwich and it being Christmas day - almost NOTHING was open.  we walked past Beach Hut Deli, my husband said hey, it's convenient, let's try it - I figured it would be small portions, probably not very good, and way overpriced - I mean, it had to be - as it was in such a high touristy  spot.  BOY was I wrong!  I can honestly say, they were about the best sandwiches we've EVER had.  My husband had (I think) turkey/avocado/pickle, blue cheese, tomato (toasted) on wheat bread - and you think - well, it's just a sandwich, how good can it be?  IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE!  Normally (at least in florida), you'd get a smear of avocado, so small you'd have to dig around to find it - not here - there were HUGE slices of avocado - all the way through the sandwich - sandwich was fresh, crunchy, DELICIOUS - I honestly can't speak highly enough about the sandwich.  Silly, right - I mean, it's just a sandwich!  I mean, JUST a silly sandwich!!!!  not like it's a 10 course meal!!!  But seriously - all through the whale watching tour, I kept thinking about it and saying "wow, that was a great sandwich" to my husband.  It really was!  I think it was about $8.50 - and well worth it.  I myself had the avocado toast, which was only about $5.75 or something like that - two slices of toast with avo and tomato - again - just delicious - I don't know WHAT they do with their sandwiches, to get those flavors - but after the whalewatching tour, I wanted to go back and get another one of each.  Unfortunately we couldn't, we had to go elsewhere to meet some people - but if I was EVER in San Diego again, I would most definitely go there and get exactly the same.  I don't know what it was about it - it's ridiculous really - I mean, they're just sandwiches - but they were just OUTSTANDING!  I seriously think just about the best sandwiches we've ever had (other than the Mack House in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where they make the best toasted cheese sandwiches in the world - unique, gourmet - out of this world) - but I'd say this is a very, very close second.  Absolutely excellent.  No, we didn't see any whales, just dolphins.  But it was Christmas Day, so they were probably all off somewhere having Christmas dinner. :-)</review>< Resp>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) Place with tropical decoration, consonant with the name of the restaurant. The customer service is not very good, they do not have a waiter service to take your order at the table, you have to stop ordering it and picking it up, the prices are too high not to include the drink or service, I had a particular situation and a All dirty person from kitchen to table to charge me $ 3 difference for their mistake. The food was good, the problem is the employees.

Lugar con decoración tropical, consona con el nombre del restaurante. El servicio al cliente es no muy bueno, no cuentan con servicio de meseros para tomarte la orden en la mesa, tienes que pararte ordernarla y recogerla, los precios estan muy elevados para no incluir la bebida ni servicio, tuve una situación particular y salio una persona toda sucia de la cocina a la mesa para cobrarme $3 de diferencia por el error de ellos. La comida estaba buena, el problema son los empleados.</Review>

<review>My cousin and I went to the bar and liked everything so much that we made reservations for the next night on the patio! The restaurant is classy with a great vibe and the menu design for mystery drinks is a fun, unique option that I've never seen before. You MUST try the ancho dusted fruit dessert when you visit - it is so, so delicious, I'll be dreaming about it for weeks. The tacos were also amazing.

While everything is great here, what really makes the Quail State shine are the staff. They're all wonderful, friendly, and warm, and they really make the restaurant stand out. The Quail State is a credit to the owners, who we had the pleasure of meeting last night as well. Try this place out asap!! If you like it half as much as I do, you'll be back again for seconds (and maybe thirds) within the month!!< /review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM76oWV8mPdmtF7QcFmBt8DO6bBKrsvnjr0PqCu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMsQPGfBd5t-r5soPNMwkMlkQR8khIqoSv0HqR5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMk2CKiyoIyBEs4jxorBRD2Sf6uyQOo7RaSEX9w=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNoXObdLZDIkyodOGMs_rH_JA8idqoqdUzyzCyR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><Resp>{'time': 1623661416725, 'text': 'Hi Addi L, Thank you for your review, we appreciate your feedback.

I can't even begin to tell you how fantastic this bar is, the vibe is perfect, the food is to die for and the drinks are out of this world. Did I mention all of the staff is friendly, professional and stylish? What are you waiting for, make a reservation!<//review>

<review>I've had 2 great dining experiences with Quail State--a very delicious (and the best) take out order late last year, and more recently excellent drinks and dinner on their rooftop patio! This place is definitely worth making a reservation for. A very unique and delicious menu and very original and locally inspired drinks. The decor and vibe is uplifiting and will make any dinner date extra special.< /review>< rating>

<review>I've had the pleasure of eating here several times since they opened and got to experience their 7 course tasting menu recently as well. I am beyond Ecstatic that they made it through opening during Covid. Not only a beautiful and unique location (especially for Fresno, go downtown revitalization!) but they have spectacular food and drinks. During the tasting menu, each course and drink was better than the last, if that's even possible. The owners really care about what they're doing and the product they put out, and usually stop by the tables to chat. I can't recommend this place enough. Go support them and help us to keep the downtown gem.</review><time>1620222406258</time><rating>5< /rating><user>112326392311870701827</user><Name>Erin Evans<//Name>< response>

<review>A friend and I went to check it out. The food was great. She had the salmon and I ordered the cauliflower and added chicken. The chicken was very tender and moist. Very flavorful. We ordered both desserts on the menu to try them both. I really enjoyed them both.</review>< response>

My wife and I  had to book in advance and now I know why. The food was exquisite and the drinks were on point as well. I got to order their egg quail burger. It was simple but great and the dessert was tasteful and light. With all this aid I will be coming back.< /Review>

Quail State has some serious potential to be a great bar in Fresno!! Their service, cocktails and location couldn't be better. The food they offer can definitely use some help. They're just missing the mark.<//review>

<Text>Quail state is AMAZING. I can’t say enough good things about them. The food is delicious, tons of options for both vegan and carnivore. The drinks! The atmosphere! You have to go and experience this Fresno. A gem that everyone needs to go try. I’m going to be a regular for sure. The staff is EXCELLENT. My server Brittanie was so sweet, took care of all our needs and was so nice to us. The owners are awesome people. We love this place! Thank you for being so great!</Text></record>

I'm not a critic ,but I am a cook. This food is great. Yo chef ! If your reading this your a god! Service was great. Food is definitely in house made. Everyone working tonight was really attentive and chill. This is the closest to an la experience I've had out here. Food is plated beautifully, the burger was so juicy and everything is well complemented. Bartender.. you made me like drinks I never thought I'd tried.  If you want an experience and we'll tasting food come here. Everyone who were hard on this place definitely never work a day in their life in this industry. This place rocks. I'm definitely making this a spot I'd go for a date night. 100% . Love this place I'm coming back for sure.! Love everyone and the vibe<//Text>

<Review>We’ve spent a few very special nights here and it’s definitely where I consider to be the best venue in the area. Josh, Hayley and the team are stellar hosts and curate an amazing menu and drink selection. We were blown away by their Mexican wine pairing night! The whole experience is ON POINT. Looking forward to more fun nights here!<//Review>< user>

<Review>Day two of opening and got most of the food on the menu (everything but an app) and everything was above expectations. (We cleared our plates) We ordered 8 drinks from the menu and not one drink disappointed. If you are looking for a real downtown vibe this is it, glad to see high quality moving into the area, a MUST in Fresno.< /Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOl63XZori6-u8B4D9oz5nPDnawGoFJr5jx7m44=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< user>

They have blankets to use for when it get a bit chilly and they also have heat lamps. It was nice to sit outside in downtown Fresno right next to Fulton street. The prices are a bit high on their signature drinks. The Quail egg burger was super yummy; it came with cauliflower on the side. Would definitely go again.< /review>< Date>

Terrific flavors in the food and drinks!  Friendly staff, great service, and fun atmosphere!  Highly recommend!!  We were a group of four, and between us we ordered the cauliflower, mushroom and pea puré with greens, the salmon and the burgers.  Both of the appetizers had unique sauces which were really intriguing. The salmon had a perfect crust of seasonings, and the burgers had a wonderful kick to them!  We were too full to try the desserts, but we will soon be back for more!  Eating out on the street next to the beautiful old building, the music, the inviting tables, the food and drinks, and the efficiency and friendliness of the staff.. even the weather contributed to a great night out!< /text>

This restaurant was really nice!! When you make your reservation make sure you do it ahead of time to get an outside rooftop table. The menu is VERY limited. I had the burger and added avocado. Was delicious!!! We had quite a few drinks that were ok. They didn't have a lot but definitely tried to customize something similar.</review>

My son and I went to Quail State for dinner on 2/5.  The mail reason for going was to support our local businesses and the downtown revitalization.

Cocktails were tasty and cocktail service was good.

We ordered our meals. My son had the quail egg burger that came with cauliflower.  Probably would have been very good, but it arrived cold.  I had the winter squash ratatouille. My meal was also cold and the portion size was very small (4 bites) for a $16 entree.

The owner stopped by and asked for our honest feedback.  We mentioned that the food temp was cold and my serving size was very small, Rather than offering a reasonable portion of hot food, she offered dessert.  We declined desert because we were still hungry for dinner.  We left and orders tacos down the street.

Word of caution: don’t order the ratatouille if you are looking for an entree.  The portion is barely appropriate as an appetizer.

In conclusion, I can’t justify supporting a business by paying $80 for 2 cocktails and two cold entrees and leaving hungry.< /review>

Fresno is lucky to have Quail State! Our dinner was perfectly prepared and the drinks were delicious. GREAT selection of natural wine! Especially since natural wine is very hard to come by in Fresno. Can't wait to try more off the menu and sip cocktails on their rooftop patio once it opens!<//review>

Food was good but portions were small and expensive. Rooftop bar doesn't have a view, but provides a good atmosphere with friends. I would start or end a night here, but would not make it my one stop shop.</Review>

What's the point if having a dropbox if you put it behind security doors and lock them at 4pm? Need a copy of my social security card for a job, apparently thats not a good enough reason to get a new appointment, and due to covid you can't just walk in. Website refuses to let me register new account and staff are unable to tell me which information I entered incorrectly. So now I have to mail a form and with covid delays I have no idea if the mail will even arrive at its destination, let alone how long it might take to get there... but what else am I supposed to do since your dropbox is only open from 9am to 4pm? GET AN AFTER HOURS DROPBOX BECAUSE CLOSING IT BEFORE THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE GET OFF WORK IS NOT JUST INCONVENIENT ITS COSTING THEM OPPORTUNITIES.

ALSO REPEAL THE PATRIOT ACT AND STOP TRYING TO USE SSN AS A UNIVERSAL IDENTIFICATION NUMBER... IT WAS NEVER INTENDED TO BE USED THAT WAY IT IS A SOCIAL SAFETY NET NOT AN ID SYSTEM.

I am a human being, not a 9-digit number. I would prefer if you started treating me that way.< /review>

Have a problem with my payee service co and was told by them to file a complaint with ssi. Ssi told me that there is no complaint process because they are a company. So there is no oversight of the companies they force us to get.
So please do not choose Service First of Northern Ca. They will take advantage of you or a loved one and will definitely take advantage of there being no oversight by the agency that forces us to use them.
Since I wrote the above I have been able to get paid directly, but now they won't release my money that the payee sent back to them. It's been over ten months that they've had my money.
And of course you can't do anything about it. It makes me wonder how many old ladies die before getting what they are owed.< /Review>

Absolutely disgusted from what I just witnessed during the guards  initial scan. An old couple brought their grandson (a 4 year old!) after scanning and making sure grandparents were clear they then need to scan the boy. He is extremely terrified- who wouldn't be at that age those guards are anything but friendly. You'd think they'd be nicer to a child. Anyways they demand to scan the boy, he's crying so scared then the guards proceed to tell the grandparents to "control that boy" "if you can't control him you can leave" "if that was my kid!" so unprofessional. absolutely unacceptable how  come they think they have the right to treat anyone this way we are customers just trying to get business done here. I have 2 special needs children who may have acted just as this little boy in this situation and to think we'd be treated this way is heartbreaking. These guards need to have their behavior addressed and learn some customer service skills. I'm sure they encounter disabled people all day and to think they treat them this way. I will be making a formal complaint with ssa.</review>

Service is horrible and slow! The whole system needs to be revamped. You wait 10-20 minutes at the door for the security to let you in. Then you pull a number and wait 1-2 hours to have your number called, just so a staff can clarify why you are there. Then you wait another 1-2 hours for your name to be called to finally resolve why you came! This is ridiculous! Pull a number and be fully serviced when called.</Text>

They have changed the open hours.
I felt safe when the Federal Security Guard checked us in and asked good questions to make sure I am not carrying weapons in. He scanned me with my arms out and legs apart.
I passed with no beeps.<//Text>

Frustrating in many ways. 1) Not possible to schedule an appointment on-line - must instead phone, then a long hold to speak to someone. 2) Currently slower processing due to undergoing a major remodel (through June 25, 2019). Wait outside 45 minutes to be admitted. 3) People waiting outside who had an appointment, weren’t advised they didn’t have to wait in line. 4) After this wait and checking in, was called and then advised that due to the limitations caused by the remodel, not all can be helped in person at this location - including my inquiry. After all this time, was directed to either use the website, or phone to schedule an appointment. 5) Took half an hour to schedule an appointment by phone.</text>

<Text>What kind of a place has ALL REPRESENTATIVES UNAVAILABLE RIGHT AT 9am?!  Called right when they opened and my call wouldn’t go through because they were “busy” also if any of you get your social security number stolen by an illegal they WON’T help you unless you have years of proof that they have completely ruined your life. They don’t care if you can’t get insurance, they don’t care if you can’t get a bank account, they don’t care that you can’t get any credit. In my case the woman has a house, cars, credit at every place imaginable even jareds diamonds or whatever. I had ICE come to my house looking for her because she used my address to trick them and it worked. Social security told me if you have any good evidence that you seriously can’t live because of this since apparently this is NOT inconvenient enough then we will give you a new number and we will flag your old one but we won’t prosecute her. Nice country this is.</Text></record>

<review>The Social Security Administration has treated my sister with so much disrespect. Cindy Norris promised to call her back and a week and a half later she decided to call and acted like her situation was no big deal. My sister is suffering with Stage 4 Lung Cancer the judge made her case a rush approval and no one at this office seems to care. I wonder if their sister was in this situation if they would be so cold. I work everyday very hard and take care of things for my clients and customers and it sickens me that they can't do their job and properly take care of people who are sick and without one penny yet these people earned this money but Social Security acts as if that is their money not her hard earned dollars. I wish that I had an opportunity to train the employees so I can teach them customer service and empathy for people with illnesses.  It is an understatement by saying they need to actually get their job duties prioritized and actually work for the money they are taking from our pay checks.  I really hope some manager reads this review and has the employees learn how to act and treat people with respect and courtesy. Another thing, they are dealing with some who don't understand professional terminology yet they don't bother trying to explain so these people can understand. It just makes me sad to know that we pay these people to do this job so poorly.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x80905178eee0fe6d:0xc520fb65d32188ab< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

It's a Social Security Office... Some of the representatives treat you like your a human and some don't. Depends on the window your called to and the security gaurds on duty. It's a coin toss.< /review>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>The best sushi restaurant experience hands down!  Thanks to James and the rest of staff who were very attentive and made appropriate suggestions to make our dining experience great!  It was an interactive dinner with sing along and dancing.  There were two large parties at the time and everything came out in good time.  The entertainment certainly helped lol!  The food was pretty good!  We ordered a rock n roll platter which came with 4 different rolls and an additional order of rock and roll. Also ordered a couple sake bombs and that was a fun experience.  Don't wanna spoil everything, just go! Ask for James to be your server!<//Text>< Pics>

<Rate>4< /Rate><review>They do not accept reservations, but arrived at 6:30p on a Fri and was seated immediately with a party of 3.  Small tables and very busy.  Initially service was a bit slow, but once we ordered the food came at a good pace.  Ordered miso soup, mutliple types of onigiri and rolls, all were good quality.  Not the best sushi I have eaten, but definitely good.  Pricing was fair.  Am keeping on my list of recommendations to friends.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

They took the best of both worlds and combined it into a fun, cool, and energetic place. You can eat, dance, and mingle. Their sake was great too. If you are looking for a night to do things you haven't done this is the place to go.</review>

Do not go here! My party of 18 was overcharged,  I never received my food until I was leaving. Asked for a discount and the cashier said no because I was receiving food. In a to-go box! My table never had enough clean dishes to participate in sake bombs. When I called the complain, I was offered a date with the MC and $100 tab "to make me happy". Not cool! Especially with the #metoo moment. I felt like a pawn and they had no concern over me being a happy customer. Save your money and go somewhere else.<//Review>

It's way over hyped, over priced, under staffed, dj sucks and so does the music. The food was just okay. I waited for a hot green tea for more than an hour...I asked repeatedly. When they finally brought it-it was cold and very bitter. We were never served some of the dishes we were supposed to get that were included in the "$25" per person option. Some of us got dishes that the rest of the guests at the same table didn't get. All in all save your time and money. Find somewhere else to go. Big disappointment. We all left hungry.</text>

<text>Last time I attended this place was 5 years ago and it was awesome. It used to be a very great place.  Yesterday 12-18-15, we went to celebrate a birthday party in which we waited 1 hour outside to get seated. Then it looked like only 1 waiter was tending everyone. We barely got some service. After placing our order for sushi it never got there, we just payed for the drinks and left. It was empty, the entertainment went out the door, just playing loud music now and days with no performing. This place went down hill. Everyone in my party, had a bad impression and will never be attending this place again.... sad.</text><pics>None<//pics><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80c295f186ff37e1:0x494d4c75b41c5a5</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Quite literally the worst restaurant experience I’ve had. After being seated every table except ours was greeted and water was served. We had waited 15 minutes just to get a server over when we had ordered sake bombs. Two sake bombs were delivered and still no water 45 minutes in. At this point we had one sake bomb each while all other tables were on their third round and food was served to the surrounding tables but not ours. I would never recommend anyone to this place when there are thousands of other places in la.<//Text>< userid>

Better come ready to party. This is not your ordinary sushi bar. Tons of fun. Load music. Awesome hosts. If you have a group of people this is a must stop. You may want to call ahead and book a table though.</review>

<Text>Food is decent... that's about it. If you want to bro out and are amused by watching your servers dance all night and force sake bombs on you, this is your spot. It's kind of like medieval times... but without the horses, pageantry and mediocre entertainment. Lots of people seem to enjoy the hell out of it, but it's definitely not my dig.<//Text>< Rating>

<time>1514516613170< /time><Rate>4< /Rate><Review>I was very impressed with the ease of service they have! Everything works like a well-oiled machine. I love the self service aspect, I love the cleanliness, and I love the variety of options, both in WHAT was served, and in HOW it was served. You can either choose your sushi from the conveyor belt, or you can put in a specific order on the touch screen and watch your sushi arrive to you moments later on the "fast track." The pricing (except for a few special items) is $2 per plate. A plate has 2 pieces if it is "big" sushi, and 4 pieces if it is "regular sized" sushi. This means that my small appetite was satisfied for only a small price! However, if you are someone who needs a lot of food in order to feel full, these prices will add up.<//Review>< pics>

I was disappointed to say the least... I had a reservation made at 7pm and confirmed multiple times, I get to the door and there is a message that reads “8/16 will open at 7:45pm” I call and they tell me that had technical difficulties, they said they would take care of me when they opened... (it’s my actual birthday today) I go next door to have a drink and give them more time to open up, I come back and place is still closed.... how do your run a business with no communication, I mean I understand there will always be unexpected issues, but how do u not communicate this to your customers, this definitely killed my birthday to say the least!!! I will never come back, this has by far been the worst experience... I’m not the one to usually complain, but I am very disappointment that my birthday ended this way.< /review>

A place where you can go as a group to have fun the waiters can make you a stripper and dance, you can take food and eat different dishes we ask for sushi. the music was very lively so we just wanted to dance and the waiters show was good.<//Text>

It's a fun atmosphere and the foods good... If they have what you ordered and if/when it finally gets to your table. The staff needs to remember it's a restaurant 1st and entertainment is secondary.</Text>

<Review>Worst customer service! Went for my birthday celebration.  It has been about 4 years since I last patronized Tokyo Delves. Are you under new management?  We had to cancel food orders including mine and all I ordered was shrimp tempura and tempura veggies go figure!  They placed beer and sake on the table for sake bombs without asking how many and they definitely charge you!. They said my cold sake was complimentary it was on the bill.
If you are not.ordering a large sushi tray good luck. And the waiter added his tip! No sir a party of 16 and only 6 people got food....The entertainment was not the same either!  And the service was in the kitchen drinking beer and someone ordered a sappro and they were out....I guess so the staff is drinking them!!! Will not go back sad!<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c295f186ff37e1:0x494d4c75b41c5a5</Gmap_id></record>

Lot of fun and a great party place.. plus the sushi is good. Check your bill at the end of the night because they sometimes overcharge for things you did not get.</text>

Since the remodel, the sushi is slightly better and the entertainment is much better. It's really dinner and a show now.</review>

Good music/dj. Had a best birthday table contest amongst the B-dayers. That was fun. The food was good; the quality of the sushi tasted fresh and the rolls were decent size. Besides the sushi the cooked dishes were japanese traditional yet delicious.<//review>< Pics>

<rate>1</rate><text>It’s so sad that the owners ruined this place with a non necessary remodel , they lost the incredibly talented sushi chefs that were the entertainment before . All musicians and actors used to love this place but greed of the owner ruined something that was working great , the service was so horrible I waited for 15 min til a waiter brought our drinks at 8:30 also knowing it was my moms birthday !!! The garlic edamame was barely cooked and still partially raw and the dumplings you could tell were store bought frozen , I had had enough of the lack of service and asked for my check immediately which I had to go to the Dj after waiting another 15 min and ask him for my check , with six servers on the floor and a half filled restaurant and servers only caring about dancing at not making sure the guests were served first , I had been here over 50 times in the past and everyone of them great and so much fun ,  til I walked in and saw it’s been ruined . They say you should never play with something that’s working well , I will never ever go back or recommend this place again to anyone .< /text>< pics>

Arrived on time for a reservation....restaurant was running behind schedule. Not sure why....they claimed they were cleaning. Upon entering the facility, a distinct urine smell enveloped us.

There was no fish in the case, the place was filthy...the bathrooms equivalent to gas station bathrooms and the whole experience lasted 2 minutes and we were OUT the door to a better place with no health hazards.

Sushi 101 was great....clean, friendly staff and some ROCKIN oysters. Don't do Delves....it's a scary place.<//Text>< pics>

Tokyo Delve's is the kind of spot you take the group out to get the birthday night started as you'll be sure as hell to be wasted before moving on to the bar. Entertaining waiters interact with the table and restaurant through the night while sake bombs are practically forced on you. Food okay but shows up after the waves of sake bombs so don't order to much as your stomach will be full of beer already.</Review><Rating>5<//Rating>< gmapID>

<rate>1</rate><Review>Horrible Horrible Horrible Place.

I waited for over two and half hours for my dinner to arrive...it never did. Ultimately I canceled, paid my liquor bill, and left.

There is some entertainment with the singing/ dancing waiters, but even then it's a bit sad looking and honestly likely a distraction from the fact that your food has not yet arrived and you're dying of hunger. The rest of my party (around 25 people total minus around 5 people that left early) apparently paid $70 each because they got the party platter meal that the waiter tried to force on all of us but I thankfully fended off. This is after the people that left early already paid down their own portions of their liquor/ food items.

Honestly, I went for a birthday party so I was there to support my beloved birthday girl...I will never go back again either on my own terms or for someone else's celebration-it was that bad.

Tokyo Delve deserves a negative million stars and a couple complaint filings from the Better Business Bureau. Pick a different venue for your birthday: it's LA, there are tons to choose from!</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

The ambiance is awesome if you don't mind spending some money. They should probably be upfront about their charges since I got a 25$ menu and ended up paying almost 70 per person otherwise it's entertaining!< /Review>

This is amazing place! Waiters were awesome, mysic, people, food, drinks... my friend and me had a blast! Except one thing... actually one person... Bryan Shapard  (supervisor as I believe) was totally rude and disrespectful to us! It was 12 am when he came over and said that we have to leave right away, even though this place close at 1 or 1.30am on Friday. I was in a good mood after everything, atmosphere was amazing! I said, give us 5 mins we will finish our drinks and leave. His response was "no we r closed you have to leave right now". I'm very nice person in general and don't like to argue, specially when I get some rest after the hard working week. I said ok give us 3 mins, I don't really like when you talk to me like that and I don't like your personality right now. His response was "I don't like you either, u out gotta go". I was shocked. I really really liked this place, but this one *****le ruined the whole night.... I would be glad to come back and know that he's fired... it's inappropriate to talk to customers like that. Any waiter in this place deserve this position of supervisor or manager, but this Bryan should be terminated!!! I won't be surprised to know that it is not the first complain on him... he's very very negative, rude and disrespectful!!! I was my worst experience talking to the managers.... ridiculously awful!< /Review>

The place is more like Farrell's Ice Cream than a Japanese restaurant. You get a choice of loud or louder, staff that pushed for orders, then we waited for food that never came. The food that did come was decent, but not worth these prices.</Text>

< Review>
GARBAGE everywhere, dirty ladies room and no paper, no bathroom & hand paper, dispenser empty. 2 hour wait for SUBSTANDARD FOOD & SUBSTANDARD SERVICE. I asked for a napkin and the ANGRY MAD COW said "I'm the owners' daughter; I collect money only!" Ok, since MAD COW'S can go to the bank, but not to diet! I knew not to eat, but my friends didn't heed the warning and got sick. Trash and nothing to offer. It's a miracle this place has not been closed down by GOD! I think it should be renamed to Tokyo DEVIL'S Stomach Cramps with a side of MAD COW :)  disease. Eat & Run (runny crap  with no paper to wipe)  IF You are OBESE and LOOK like a slob with no manners or class, a hater with $2 bucks and think you are the PARIS Hilton of the PROJECTS, THEN YOU ARE HOME at the FAT FARM

Go to Katsu-ya the food is edible 11680 Ventura Blvd. Studio City 91604 and is Zagat Rated, That mean its great<//Review>

I had a sushi & udon (91,000 VND) at this lunch. I was so supplied with the vegetable salad. It is not served any dressing. I have never seen the salad without dressing. I claimed to  waiters, but they said this is our way.
Another claim is ,Udon is not hot enough, too low temperature. Unfortunately, any body can' speak Japanese and English in such critical situation .How you can manage your restaurant.<//review>

<Review>The food is absolute crap lol. but the place is sooo fun to go to!!!!! At least until the bill comes lol. I've now come here twice for birthday parties and it seems like they get $50 or $60 out of you no matter what. If you don't mind being the Negitive Nancy of your party group, you should get everyone to order A La Carte the cheapest thing instead of their $25 or $35 per person "deal"< /Review><Gmap_id>0x80c295f186ff37e1:0x494d4c75b41c5a5</Gmap_id><userid>109036872752543183892< /userid>< user_name>

< review>
One of the optometry appointments I've EVER had!  Their technology equipment, customer service, doctor's knowledge and bedside manner were phenomenal!  Highly recommend any and everyone to visit this optometry clinic.  The doctor even showed me what they look for with the scans they do... it was educational and interesting to see what's going on INSIDE my eyes!  Thanks for the awesome experience... definitely coming back for future appointments!<//review>

The staff is always friendly, efficient, and helpful. Ordering glasses was great because they helped me calculate totals for 2 pairs with or without insurance to ensure I was getting the best deal. I’m always pleased to get my yearly eye exam at Family Eye Care. Dr. Garcia and his staff are wonderful and provide quality service and care. Thanks!<//Text>

My visit to Family Eye Care was an exceptional experience. The staff was friendly, kind, supportive, and I felt like they really cared. I was picking out frames and I was able to get the opinion and advice from 3 different staff members to help me make a decision. They all genuinely wanted to help me choose the frames that would be the best for me. The office was clean and the building is beautiful. I can’t wait for my next visit!< /Review>

I almost never give five stars. If someone gets four stars from me they did a heck of a great  job. 🙂 I think the options on glasses was a bit confusing. The doctor was great and explained everything comprehensively. There was no wait time. I didn’t see surface cleaned after use, like the card reader but other than that everything was clean and they provide hand sanitizer. They have the best selection of glasses.<//review>

I am pleased with this place, in times of COVID when facilities had just begun to reopen, I needed to have my eyes examined. Dr. Garcia's office staff took all the safety measures to ensure both the staff and my protection. I received my exam, got my new pair of glasses, that we're desperately needed, along with eye drops.  Thank you Dr. Garcia and staff.</Text>

Every time I enter Family Eye care I know they will be on time, professional, and friendly. I have been trusting my eyes to Family Eye Care for many years. Dr. Garcia‘s team members will not only make you feel at home they make you feel like you’re a friend. The inventory of eyewear is top-of-the-line. After years of suffering with dry eye, Dr. Garcia finally solved this problem for me with several dry eye treatments. It has made such a huge difference in my life. Thank you Dr. Garcia and your wonderfully professional team.< /review>

Betty was a great help. I have been going here for years and service has always been nice.  However, this was the first time anyone actually looked at my personalized insurance to see what it offered to see what my all my options were.  It made the experience even better.< /Review>

I had made an appointment for the 28th of July and when I arrived I was informed my appointment was at their Corcoran office.  Unbeknownst to me I didn’t even know they had an office there, but they went ahead and had the doctor see me in the Lemoore office.  They were all very kind and friendly and I so appreciated they didn’t make me reschedule.  They were all very professional in the way the situation was handled.  Thank you!!😊😊< /review>< Time>

Everyone was lovely to deal with. Really liked Dr. Garcia very much. The eye exam process was incredibly easy and efficient.
My only issue is the cost of new lenses for my current frames. I could not possibly afford them—almost $500 for one set of lenses after insurance applied! So I have my new prescription and will use a known online supplier for my lenses.< /Text>

The woman that helped me to choose my glass frames was very sweet and talkative, her name was Elijah. I took a long time choosing my frames and deciding what I wanted. She wasn’t rushing me. We had great conversation while I was there. I’ve been going there since I was in middle school and I highly recommend. The staff was very friendly!< /Text>

Well staffed and polite. A 10:30am appointment means 10:30am, unlike other places where you're waiting another half hour before being seen.
The staff is welcoming and explain everything clearly.

The staff there was amazing they really go above and beyond to make you feel comfortable and it really helps that they ask if you have any questions at all they'd be happy to answer them and when you do have a question they seem to be very knowledgeable which helps out alot . It just seems like they are very eager to listen to any problems are questions that you might have about the different types of eye wear are offers that may & are available to you.
What really stands out the most is never once did I ever feel rushed I felt like as long as I had questions they were there to listen an offer solutions that best met whatever concerns are needs that I might have.
I would definitely recommend them to anybody that might ask.
As far as for anybody that might be considering them are maybe still on the fence about there decision ,
Trust me you can stop wondering if this would be the ideal eye care facility for Your Family , Because I'd say without a doubt "Yes" they Most  Definetly are .</Review>

< Review>
Another great visit at the eye doctor! So much better than going to the dentist ha ha. The facility is very clean and plenty of staff on hand to expedite the exam process. Dr. Garcia treated me very well and has for many years.</Review>

< Review>
Family Eyecare with Dr. Jeffrey Garcia in Lemoore has an entire staff of friendly and professional faces.
I was greeted by the staff who ensure to follow all COVID-19 protocols to not only ensure their safety but also those of their patients. I was amazed with how modern this practice is and believe that their state of the art equipment is essential in providing the best care. I admire Dr. Garcia’s dedication to not only create a connection with his patients but also ensuring they have an appointment where all their concerns are heard. I will recommend Dr. Garcia’s practice to friends and family and will gladly return. Marlene did an outstanding job helping me find the right pair of lenses.</Review>

<text>This office, the personnel, the service, care and treatment, unbelievable...  It is very far & few in between that there are healthcare/type offices that treat you like you were their "only" patient that day.

Dr.Luna, her staff, were absolutely so caring, thoughtful and most of all PROFESIONAL & on the Ball, they were right on top of things from the get go.

I went in with a simple but pricey & annoying DMV requested vision report and left with the referral process to my dr for cataract surgery, not to mention all the insurance bull they helped me cut through.

The staff there are the most knowledgeable, professional and caring group that I've seen in a long time.

Thank you Dr. Garcia for putting this wonderful office in our small town.

During the one month this business has had my glasses they have failed to notify as to the status or outcome. I have spent $700 for these glasses. I expect better and reliable customer service.
Previously, I have sent an inquiry his their web site. They have not responded. This non response suggests to me they are not interested in checking or responding to customer concerns. Unacceptable business practice.</text>

Everyone from the girls at the front desk, all the way till the end were wonderful! From the Dr who examined me to the gal helping me pick out my glasses. This team is fantastic! I felt like my business was truly appreciated. As far as I'm concerned this is and will be my new eye team. Very professional and a clean office too. I went to the Corcoran branch and am so grateful to have this quality of service in our community!!</Review>

<review>The staff is very friendly and helpful. They were very cheerful upon us entering despite that it was early in the morning. The doctors are wonderful no matter who we see. They are always explaining what is going on during our visit. My oldest son gets nervous any time he visits a doctor and everyone  is great working with him and answering his questions. Maria was very patient and wonderful helping us pick out his eye glasses and sports glasses. She asked us what he needed and she catered and answered all our questions. She explained our bill and let us know what insurance will cover and will not. We always enjoy our visits!</review><user_name>Donnamarie Ferrer< /user_name>< UserId.>

Everything about “customer service” is Dr. Garcia and his staff. They focus on you, the patient. Nothing is rushed and all is completed to the best ability.
All medical practices could learn from the experience at Dr. Garcia’s office.< /review>

Friendly, professional staff. Safety precautions taken.
Explanation given about each test administered.
Dr. Garcia explained test results using visual images of my eyes. He listened to my concerns and questions and answered them in a way I could understand the information. Staff explained estimated cost for new lenses. Felt welcome, comfortable and confident about the care of my eyes.</Text>

She explained our bill and let us know what insurance will cover and will not. We always enjoy our visits!<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

Absolutely wonderful  as always. My daughter  always  sees Dr  Guerra. She is very personable and doesn't  just listen to the parents. She also listens to the kids and addresses their concerns too. She is very thorough and explains everything to the kids. All of the staff are just as amazing.</review>

<Review>Everyone from the girls at the front desk, all the way till the end were wonderful! From the Dr who examined me to the gal helping me pick out my glasses. This team is fantastic! I felt like my business was truly appreciated. As far as I'm concerned this is and will be my new eye team. Very professional and a clean office too. I went to the Corcoran branch and am so grateful to have this quality of service in our community!!< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<Time>1603189850886<//Time><rate>5< /rate><review>Dr. Garcia office has made quick modification to put patients at ease during this pandemic. Right from the start if you can read and knock for assistance at the front door they meet you and take your temp and confirm your appointment. I do understand why so many people don't read the sign and just try to to open the door and that's because they have like 8 signs on it. But that in itself is the comical relief you get while waiting to be called to the back. Very professional and informative on your insurance plan which is great. I will continue to support my local city business.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<Review>Dr. Brar was so helpful, and thorough; taking time to explain what I was experiencing with my vision and how they could correct it. Christina was patient explaining my options in choosing my eyewear, and really listened when I described my preferences. Because I felt she gave me good advice on style and fit, I upgraded my lenses. Even driving for 45 minutes from Fresno, I couldn't be happier! Thank you to the Family Eyecare team!<//Review></record></dataset><record>

During the one month this business has had my glasses they have failed to notify as to the status or outcome. I have spent $700 for these glasses. I expect better and reliable customer service.
Previously, I have sent an inquiry his their web site. They have not responded. This non response suggests to me they are not interested in checking or responding to customer concerns. Unacceptable business practice.< /Text>

It is such a blessing in a town that’s rather small as ours is, to have such a professional, upscale, caring optometry as Family Eye Care.
I am so impressed that they have such state of the art equipment not being located in a metropolitan area.
Staff is always courteous. You are always greeted when you walk in. I have never had a very long wait time. Dr. Garcia and his staff are able to make sure that your vision is cared for with the most updated knowledge and equipment. We are so lucky and blessed to have them here. I highly recommend them.< /Review>

Wonderful facility. Love their text alerts for appt reminders and rescheduling. Saturday hours are very helpful for those of us that work and have a hard time getting away during the week. They also have a great selection of glasses! Wish they could provide a wait time when we arrive for appts. Hate waiting 30 min to see a dr. I get sometimes there are double bookings but then let us know wait time so we can go outside and do a call or run a quick errand. All-in-all, a first class eye care facility. Highly recommend!<//Text>

Dr.Luna, her staff, were absolutely so caring, thoughtful and most of all PROFESIONAL & on the Ball, they were right on top of things from the get go.

I went in with a simple but pricey & annoying DMV requested vision report and left with the referral process to my dr for cataract surgery, not to mention all the insurance bull they helped me cut through.

The staff there are the most knowledgeable, professional and caring group that I've seen in a long time.

Thank you Dr. Garcia for putting this wonderful office in our small town.

Yvonne Hernández, My latest experience at Family Eye Care was awesome! They did an amazing job. They were very careful and followed CDC guideline due to Covid-19. I missed Dr. Garcia, but the new Dr. was outstanding as well. It’s always a pleasure going to this optometrist! Highly recommend them. Thank you for the pleasant visit during these hard times!</Text>

<Text>My first time with this facility. Everyone was friendly. My doctor was willing to answer questions and had great bedside manners. The young lady helping me pick out new glasses wasn't pushy and let me look around without trying to up sell me on anything. The place was clean and organized. I was comfortable and I'll definitely be going back. I recommend this place for anyone looking for a new eye care location.</Text>< Pictures>

<text>Had and appointment for a child's first ever eye exam.  Waited over 1 1/2 hours before my child was seen.  Other patients arriving after we had already been sitting and waiting were seen before us.  There was an intern there.  Was asked if we would rather see intern or wait for the doctor.  Stated we would wait for the doctor.  Waited additional 30 minutes before being seen.  Exam was great.  Just the wait time was unacceptable.  Was late getting back to work.<//text>< Response>
{'time': 1561658624563, 'text': 'Jennifer, let me sincerely apologize to you for your excessive wait time.  That is definitely not acceptable at all as your time is very valuable.

I can truly say that Lemoore Family Eye Care goes out of their way to make sure that you have the best experience. It was true for me from the moment I called to make my appointment when I was greeted very professionally. When I got to the clinic, the friendly staff at the front counter made me feel welcomed and were very attentive to my needs. Furthermore, Dr. Garcia put the final touch in this great experience by explaining all the photos taken of my eyes along with recommendations. Overall, the experience was exceptional. If you are looking for the best service and care for your eyes, look no further and visit their office.<//Text><response>None</response></record></dataset><record>

The staff was kind enough to squeeze me if, as I had been waiting for a month to get in. Everyone from their assistants to the doctor were very friendly and professional. Marleen assisted me in pick out two pairs of glass and had she not helped me I would have been there for hours trying to decide. She was very friendly, professional and had beautiful brown eyes. Thank you for your assistance and look forward to getting my new glasses.< /text>< Pictures>

<text>Dr. Garcia is absolutely amazing! He is super sweet and takes time to truly get to know his patients - and he's wonderful with children of all ages! The first time I took my son here, he was 3. He was naturally scared to be going to the "doctor" since the only doctor he'd visited always gave him shots. By the time we left Dr. Garcia's my son was asking when we would be coming back. ALL of the girls in the office are absolute gems as well - always greeted with a smile and kindness! You can really tell everyone absolutely loves what they do in this office! Their office vibe and demeanor is super professional, and you can't beat their beautiful decor! I travel over two hours to his office for our appointments, because it's super hard to find this kind of wonderful treatment.< /text><username>Amanda Rivas<//username><Rating>5< /Rating>< date>

<Text>We’ve been seeing Dr. Garcia and his staff for about 11 years now.  They take the time to get to know you and provide you with excellent eye care.
Being diabetic, Dr. Garcia (after my eye exam) sent a letter to my Primary Care Physician letting him know I had no diabetic damage to my eyes.
They have an amazing selection of eyewear choices and once you choose a frame your glasses are usually ready for pickup in a few days.
After our last visit, there was a little trouble coordinating our Vision benefits, but Marlene made one phone call to our insurance and everything was straightened out.  Now that’s great customer service.   Our family will be patients of Dr. Garcia for many years to come.  ❤️<//Text><name>Denise Doria</name><resp>{'time': 1556636745746, 'text': "Denise, thank you for taking the time to send us such kind comments.

The person who takes you back to check your eyes and prescription was not welcoming at all, it felt like I was just a number, no greeting  just "sit right here and put your chin there. The screen was dirty and hadn't been cleaned from the previous persons use. I mentioned it and she said " oh they didnt clean it". Thank goodness the Dr. I saw was much better and made me feel important. Customer service was lacking and I was disappointed after being a patient there for many many years.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x8094c0a0141d77fb:0xc1f5460211fec52</GmapID></record>

Ive always enjoyed going to Dr Garcia and his other Drs have been really great with my kids my last visit must have been too early for his ladies in the front one really looked like she was in a bad mood. Maybe she wasn't feeling good but other than that I have always had great experiences going to Dr Garcia's offices.< /text>

I got charge for contact fitting after I told them I didn't need it, to begin with they gave me the wrong brand of contacts because they don't have what I use.  I have one box at home and told them I just need the exam.  They didn't gave me my contact prescription unless I pay $40 dollars for contact fitting.  Contacts I don't used and will throw away after leaving the office and contacts I didn't need because I have a box at home.  Before you try something make sure you won't get charge they have a sneaky way of doing that.<//Review>

<Review>Dr Garcia is the best eye doctor we have seen in a long time . When we first moved here my son poked a hole in his eye on a Sunday evening around 4 . I was frantic and forgot it was Sunday , so I got the phone book out and looked for a doctor, Dr Garcia was the first one I saw and called him . Of course no answer but I left a message anyway . Dr Garcia called me back in about five minutes. He told us to come down to his office and he would meet us there . Took care of my son with great passion and care I can't say enough about him . We ended up going to the hospital in Fresno as he recommended for us to make sure the hole was not in the cornia . The hole was right next to the cornia and was leaking fluids so a patch and antibiotics. Dr Garcia told me to please call him when we were home and found out what needed to be done . Well before we could get home Dr called me to check in on my son and it was 1:30 in the morning 👌. He told us come and see him that next day and we were there ! He is a blessed man to have that much care for someone he never met before and he was there when we needed him most . My son is fine and his eye healed well and needless to say my whole family sees Dr Garcia and we recommend him to everyone.God Bless this man !<//Review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

Very disappointed in the service! I have been a patient for over a decade; and the staff in Lemoore were rude, unhelpful, AND I had to show the assistant how to bill my insurance correctly. The only reason I gave two (2) stars is because one star goes to the Doctor and the other goes to the Hanford staff. I will NOT be purchasing any of my glasses within this office in the future. Eye exam only! Dr. Garcia please have an evaluation of employees regularly in order to have continued success.</text>

The Lemoore office is actively sanitized with sanitizing stations.  The office is very spacious, so there is no need for assistance to get me in/out of my huge power wheelchair, SCORE❗ ALL staff are absolutely outstanding💯 I get a comprehensive exam by Dr. Garcia (my personal fav), explained well, doesn't take long & takes the time to answer any questions I may have.  Wait time under 5 minutes, (total time 45 minutes).  EVERYONE treats me like a valued client/patient.  Optometrist Tech Marleen is "THE BOMB,  BOOYA"❗❗❗ Alissiah, is VERY smart, helpful & professional as well, she's a jack of all trades & a keeper.  Zeida, Donna, Ivy, Maria, Christine ALL answer the phone professionally with a cheerful tone & if they are busy, other staff readily helps out.  If they put you on hold it's for seconds, not minutes or oops hung up on.  I am VERY exacting & picky.  I do know that I must drive these outstanding people crazy, but they don't give me the evil or rolling eyes👍 Professional, dedicated, easy going & caring staff that I am pleased with😊  Without a doubt, I Will return as needed. A+👍  BEST of the BEST❗  LUV my eye care family💚💚💚</Text>

Great help from Cassandra!  Helping me pick out frames that fit my face and explaining simple the different types of lens options that were available to me as well as how they would help my eye health.   Love my new glasses 🤓
I am so happy to have such a great optometry off in Lemoore!
Thank you Family Eye Care Team!< /Review>
