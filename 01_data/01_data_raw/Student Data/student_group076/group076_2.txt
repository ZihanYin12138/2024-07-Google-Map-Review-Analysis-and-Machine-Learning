Just went to Arcana Brewing after a friend recommended it to me. My boyfriend had enjoyed some of their beer at a beer and mead festival in 2019 but other than that it was completely new to us. I am so glad that our friends recommended it otherwise I wouldn’t have known how close it was to my house. The beer was absolutely amazing. They have a great selection including some unique options. We started with a flight and then got some pints. The owner was very personable and kind. He was clearly passionate and supportive of other local businesses. With over 200 breweries in San Diego County, it is great to find a location with amazing beer, service, and prices so close to home. The hours are minimal due to COVID, but I will happily make time to stop by again. The beer and service is without a doubt 100% worth it. Thank you Dan for your hospitality and service. We had a great time and will definitely be coming back.<//Review>

I love the steampunk vibe of the place, and Dan (and staff) make coming in for a beer feel like hanging with friends. Their mug club is unique, and we've been members for 2 years. Their braggots are phenomenal. It's a hidden gem in Carlsbad :)< /Text>

<text>Great local Brewery with affordable prices. If you're looking for the next up and coming brewery look no further. Dan (the owner) and the rest of the staff are very friendly and there is sense of community among the regulars. I recommend trying their Black Magic Braggot or the Voyager English Ale</text><userid>103185251893981006887</userid><Name>Chris Vozzolo<//Name><response>None<//response><time>1618602670410</time><pictures>None< /pictures><gmapID>0x80dc737b8c062a4f:0x2c565b7c46ba0fc8< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Place is cool. There are mugs for the mug club and that’s the only way you can drink in them. Kinda cool. We got a bunch of tasters to try. My flight was good. I like their pale ales, the fruity ones- it reminded me of the holidays. My bf mostly IPAs and he wasn’t too fond of it. It was really bitter, like extremely bitter, kind of like bitter melon. It was their current IPA on tap. Staff was friendly and cool. Cool place! Would come back and try others.< /Text>

Arcana is the best brewery! Dan, the owner and brewer, makes really great beer as well as make every customer feel welcome. The rye IPA and headbasher IPA are my favorites, among many other great beers he offers and are all unbelievably good. He has games, a great environment and really great beer. Don't wait and check it out!< /review>

Best beer, best host, best brewer. That's saying a lot in a region (San Diego County) that has some 120 breweries; Arcana doesn't offer a shi-shi restaurant or a fancy decor... just a really good array of beers served by the guy who owns the place and brews the brews. Dan is a great host who cares about your experience. Visit this place and compare it against breweries less authentic.</Review>

Fantastically unique beer selection and very friendly staff, with great beer prices - you can get tasters, half pours, or pints, and a flight of 4 tasters of any of their beers will put you back $8
Highly recommend the Black Magic Braggot - very flavorful, and tastes closer to mead than ale.
Definitely recommend this place 👍🏼< /review>

< Review>
definitely make the stop here if you are around. the guys behind the counter are very knowledgeable and good friends with other owners and brewers. they asked what we liked and pointed us in the direction of other breweries to try. that was a great touch and we were there early right when they opened. they gave a good word on the "west coaster" magazine, you should read that if you're reading this!!! their headbasher IPA is the go to for me</Review>

Friendly and welcoming staff. The Mosaic and Saison (Sage) are excellent. Quirky spot with a very eclectic mug club selection. Worth a stop if in the area.<//review>

Really good beer with lots of different types, not just IPAs.  Love the latest stout as well as the bacon beer. Super friendly service from Dan, the brewer. It’s tucked away in an office complex so a bit hard to find but worth the effort. Pretzels to snack on and board games to pass the time if you don’t want to chat with others at the bar. Weekend food trucks and frequent fund-raising events for local dog-related charities.</review>

A comfortable relaxed atmosphere, friendly owner and brewer, food trucks on the weekend, and the beer is pretty good too.  Loved everything I've tried here.  Lots of variety and not as IPA extreme as many other local spots so there is something for everyone's taste preference.</text>

Great beer, and awesome brewmaster/owner. Tried the XMAS Dark Ale, English Brown Ale and Hazy Headbasher IPA, all were delicious. Dark ale was one of the best dark ales I have had in SD.<//text>

<review>Great spot. Had a flight of 6 beers with a touch of a seventh comp'd by the owner. The owner was really friendly and gave us some tips on other spots to hit.

<rate>5</rate><text>Definitely one of the better small craft breweries out there.  Not a huge fan of the aesthetic (steam punk?) but who cares when the beer is good.  Fewer IPAs on tap than others, but that let me to try a bunch of other styles I wouldn't typically and am so glad I did.  The Broggot was incredible as was the Kahluminaughty Stout.  Knowledgeable bar tenders (brewers), dog friendly, dart boards, games...what more can you ask for.</text>< Pictures>

Very unique beers, great quality, very nice sitting arrangement decorations, and wall paintings, unlike most other breweries, you don't feel like in a factory  (no smell, no noise, acoustics is good (you can hear your partners))</text>

<rate>5<//rate><text>Of all the North County nanobreweries I've visited, Arcana consistently pours the tastiest beers. Marley's Ghost, Voyager, Headbasher, very solid top-notch brews. Sure you can find novelty beers and off-the-wall ingredients in other establishments, but after a few sips you'll likely say "next!". There isn't a beer on Arcana's board that I wouldn't drink a whole pint of.

Arcana does not hold a monopoly on great atmosphere and knowledgeable staff, but what sets them apart is the steady high-quality & taste of each individual beer. Never an off-flavor or an overbearing note, but plenty of delightful English-style ales, braggots, Belgians, and darks.< /text><response>None< /response><username>Kent Crandall< /username><Pictures>None</Pictures>< gmapID>

<text>Cute little shop with great customer service. The cakes are amazing!!!!!! They have a variety of flavors and topped with cream cheese frosting, which is a huge hit for me since normal frosting is really sweet. They have the cakes in different sizes, I got the little one and it's perfect to share with someone or keep it for yourself. The chocolate chocolate chip is really good and I highly recommend it!< /text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNCYKKq-4kI_EY1Coaee5SCgcqbA_Zmjjptn0dO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< Resp>

I was planning on checking this place out, but there are some very annoying UFC adjacent to the business that made sure that did not happen.

EDIT FOR OWNER: contact the Temecula Town Center managers and tell them about the solicitation that extends well beyond the UFC office. Ive done my part by informing the public. I am not going to submit information twice, its a waste of my time at this point.</Text>

< Review>
I ordered 2 cakes for my friend and they only delivered one to her. I call to explain to them and they insisted that they had delivered both. They tried to imply that maybe my friend did receive both and that maybe she didn't see it. How do you not see a cake? I was lost for words. My friend did NOT receive the second cake! Instead of trying to solve the problem they just kept putting me on hold and coming back and basically saying the same thing. Maybe something is wrong with their delivery service but I would be careful when ordering from here. Never ordering from them again. So disappointed< /Review>

Haven't been to this place in about 10 years, hated their c.s. So went in recently for the first time since to buy a small cake. I asked if they could cut it in half for me. "Oh, No, we don't do that". Ok...can I please have a fork? "Oh, No, we don't have forks". Cancelled my transsction and took my money back. This is the absolute WORST place ever!! They do not accomodate even the simplist of things. Amazing they are still in biz</review>

I wish there was option to leave zero stars rating.
My experience at this this shop as always is unwelcoming and the workers always have horrible customer service skills. Yesterday my friend and I went to by some bundts. We asked for red velvet and raspberry bundts. We left the intention everything was correct in our box. Once we arrived to work we found out the order was incorrect but we called to inform them . We were told they would fix our order and we laughed it off. Late in the day the manger called back to call us LIARS and inform us what we received was our order. How would I not remember what I ordered an hour ago . Besides that I later came to the shop and get my correct order after having to speak to manger multiple times on how my order was wrong. Then when speaking to her in person she was trying to deny the fact she ever call us lairs.
BOTTOM LINE : DON'T EVER COME HERE. THEY HAVE HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE . THEY TREAT PEOPLE LIKE THIS ALL THE TIME.
GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.<//review>

Arrived at 645 PM tonight to discover they were closed already. They stated online they're open until 7 PM. I was really excited to take my grandfather his favorite bundt cakes, but it's very disappointing that the hours online are not followed.
I noticed another woman walking up to the door as I got into my car, so clearly I'm not the only one.</Text>

I ordered a white chocolate raspberry cake for my daughter's 50rh b-day which is her favorite. We planned a out of town party and i had my son pick up. I never thought to tell him to be sure and get the flavor I ordered. I called them as soon as I returned and they were closed  so I called the next morning. I spoke to a very nice gal that was so kind and told me she had to speak to a manager about a refund and someone will get back to me. I received a call from Stacey who advised me that they won't do anyting since it was signed for and that's it. Just a head's up for future customers .</Text>< name>

<Review>These make lovely gifts or small birthday treats. Even treat yourself, they are delicious and special! The white chocolate raspberry is my favorite, especially with a BOGO, which you can get occaisionally by signing up for their emails, in the Entertainment book or in the Get1Free coupon mailer.

<review>One of the best car rental places you will go to. Everyone there is super nice. I saw a cheap price for a Toyota Corolla on Expedia and when I got there they upgraded me to a 2020 Honda Accord which served perfectly. When I returned it, they checked the car very quickly and then checked me out within the matter of minutes. They also returned my deposit as soon as the next day. I have absolutely nothing to complain about. Definitely recommend!<//review>< rating>

This is how they work :
1) THEY LIE advertising cheap prices and unlimited mileage on the website making you come to their place.
2) They charge you $25 insurance per day (you can buy $11 insurance on Priceline) + $20 for unlimited mileage per day.
3) You can drive only in California, Nevada, Arizona + few more restrictions (see images below)
4) They charge you a huge cleaning fee and more, look at their rating there is a reason for that, read reviews, and be smarter, do NOT go there, they will find a way to charge you. Find any rental car company with a rating above 3.5 stars.

I went to Priceline to book a car as I usually do every month for 1 year, saw those very attractive prices with UNLIMITED MILES (image 5) from an unknown company Economy/Priceless "hmmm I'll give it a chance" car is booked. A few days later my schedule is set, I'm excited to go to the rental place which is hard to find on the top floor of the parking with no signs.
First red flag - a woman in line in front of me started yelling because the rental company going to charge her $150  for dog hairs on the back seat. I thought wow poor woman, vacuum cost like $3 on a car wash but I don't have a dog so I'm okay.
In my turn, the employee asked me Driver License, Credit Card, and insurance, after he filled up all the info he saying that I have 10 (TEN, X) miles per day. What!? What are you talking about man? I booked a car with unlimited miles (image 5), keep 10 miles for yourself, and just give me a car I'm in rush. Then he explained to me that I was supposed to ignore "UNLIMITED MILEAGE"  and read tiny signs after I scrolled down somewhere on the website". I told him that there was no such sign when I booked a car via Priceline. Eventually, he was trying to charge me $20 per day for unlimited miles + $22 insurance per day on top of the rental price. When I asked him "How would you feel if you're in rush, you have a schedule, you booked a car with unlimited miles but instead, you get 10 miles per day, do you think is it normal?" He answered: "it is a little harsh".</Text>

Rented a car for a week. Easy pick-up and drop-off, as long as you come prepared with your own documents (proof of insurance, boarding pass (if out of state) and ID) then you will have no issues and no time getting your car. My rental car was in great condition. Would definitely rent from them again. Office is located on rooftop of hotel parking garage.< /text>

<review>Scam as others mentioned.

I rented a car for 4 days. Upon dropping it off, the "office" was empty. I dropped the vehicle off and moved on with my day.

This morning I woke up to their email claiming that I put a dent that was already there (which I mentioned to them at the time of pick up).

I rent cars a lot. But I have never had a scam being pulled on me like that.

I will see you in court.<//review>< pics>

Do NOT use this company for car rental...i wish i had paid attention to the reviews... Car had mechanical issues had to return it and this company required proof of insurance in person otherwise you are forced to buy theirs so be prepared if you must rent from priceless.  Otherwise....RUN FAST!<//Text>

<review>I read all the horrible reviews of this place and was hesitant but decided to take a chance. I read all the fine print, reviewed the complaints and was prepared with everything I needed when I arrived. The entire experience was without a hitch. I got a great price through expedia on a compact SUV and they upgraded me for free because they were out when we arrived. The 2018 van was nearly new and in great shape for the 10 day trip. Rosa and the other young lady were so nice and so helpful, even after being griped out by the customer before us. We made sure to show extra kindness and they did the same. When we returned the vehicle there was another young lady there who was also very nice and checked us in fast. I expected to wait a couple weeks for the deposit (as is usual) but after looking at my bank info realized they didn't even charge me one. Great rental experience!! Kindness pays off people, being rude is so unnecessary when everyone is just trying to do their job.< /review><resp>{'time': 1534959278067, 'text': "Hi M B, thank you SO much for this review!

<Review>Rosa was very helpful after so many failed attempts of trying to get a rental car, when I thought all was lost here comes Rosa saving the day. They require full coverage of your insurance so be prepared. The car was literally brand new couple thousand miles drives like a beast.< /Review>< username>

<Date>1619487271692</Date><review>Rip off. Car advertised as $40 a day ended up being close to $100 dollars a day. For a complete junk car. I could’ve went to Expedia and rented a Range Rover for that much. The listing said all together it would be slightly over $200.. ended up being $600. The car I picked up had weed smashed all in the floorboards everywhere. I work in mental health and transport clients who are sober frequently.. a real nightmare. Asked if I could drop off the car the day after I rented it and I was told I WOULDNT BE REFUNDED ANY OF MY MONEY IF I DID.

The woman at the counter is nice enough though.</review>< rating>

These guys are thieves!!!

They quote you for a good price then double charge at checkout.

Then when I called them out on it they tried to say I dinged their car door so they charged my card an extra 700$</text>

<pics>None<//pics><review>Company has submitted an insurance claim and now wants $500 from me as well in a claim that is at best a sham. My wife rented a car from them and was give the car in the pitch black dark parking lot in a black car. At the time my wife has also just arrived in LA due to the death of her aunt. They rushed her around the car and had her sign that there was no damage. When she returned the car they "noticed" damage to the plastic bumper guard under the front of the car. They filed a claim for over $2000 with my insurance for their damage. I told my insurance it was t worth fighting and just to pay it. Due to my deductible they now need me to pay the $500. I advised them I would pay it as soon as they could show me evidence the car was repaired, therefore legitimizing the claim and they refuse to do so. This damage is a place that no rental car company we have ever used, and we rent a lot of cars, has ever looked at. After receiving their BBB ratings and multiple public review sites, which in hindsight I should have reviewed prior to renting, there is a clear pattern of this sort of behavior from the company. They are constantly charging for what their customers are claiming is bogus damage, many in this same bumper guard under the car. It is evident that they are offering low rental prices and then turning around and making money by filing insurance claims for anything they can find on the car, even if it wasn't caused by that customer. I'm sure they have not fixed this car, which is why they won't provide me proof, and have most likely charged other customer for this damage as well since our rental.<//review></record></dataset><record>

-0.00 / 5

Go to any car rental place with 3.5+ stars.

This place is a scam. Upon arrival I saw two customers yelling at the employees because they overcharged them and hit them with a fake smoker fee.

They even quoted me a cheap price and later when I returned the car said I “scuffed” their car. It was already there! They then proceeded to scam my insurance $1800 for a door ding.

Overall poor experience.
The owners are cheap scam artists.
They operate by ripping off & making fake insurance claims.<//Text>

<Review>They are the biggest rental company scammers and they know what they are doing.....They have done this before... just read all the reviews below this... This company claimed that we scratched the car on the bottom right front bumper but later told us that we were clear and that our account has been closed and they send us an e-mail confirmation final bill which we reviewed. Everything seemed normal after this transaction. A couple of days later, I noticed that they charged my visa card $400 without my approval, knowledge or consent. When we called them, they indicated that we refused to sign the paperwork which was a big lie. Do not trust them.  Take pictures of every corner and even under the car when you rent a car from them, because they will frame you for something you have not done.  Never ever ever again. Worse experience ever from a rental company.... We should have read the reviews of other claims... two of the reviews were exactly the same as mine... same location in the car... Terrible and so sad.....< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x80c2b72e4448b437:0x8bd4f98236f405be< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I travel a lot and have dealt with many car rental companies but these people are extremely bad. They claimed that there was scratches to the van that we’re originally there. These people are rip offs and want to make extra money off you considering their prices are  low. I don’t recommend coming to this company and you should consider looking at another company.</review><pics>None<//pics><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x80c2b72e4448b437:0x8bd4f98236f405be<//gmapID></record>

Terrible experience.
Please do not come here, thinking you will save money. Go to a reputable company.
When we booked car, did not say we needed a credit card. At pick up, they charged us $75 to use debit card. Never offered toll option, then charged us  $25.
Upon return of car, they said we had damaged undercarriage and were going to bill insurance.
There was nothing there as we have pictures to prove it. Manager had a negative attitude.
If you do decide to take chances with this company, take pictures and videos of car and keep your fingers crossed.
Just read all their negative reviews!

Called to extend my rental for another week. They quoted me double the rate they are currently offering online. They apparently do not allow back to back rentals???
Now I’m reading all these HORRIBLE reviews- I’m worried they will try to “find” damage to the car.
How is this place in business???

They made my entire experience in California worth it. Everyone I dealt with were so kind, professional, and hard working. I don’t think I’d ever rent again from anyone else in Los Angeles. See you again in a couple months!

Advice for people — make sure you come prepared. It’s super easy to get through the process if you have your license, and insurance information.

The added 15$ toll expense was totally worth it as well if you plan on cruising the coast!< /Text>

I really wish I would have read all the previous reviews.... it is true this business is absolute TRASH. Their prices may be cheap but they get you by using very sketchy business practices and tacking on tons of random fees such as $70 to use a debit card. At the time I was going to get my rental there were several of us waiting and we all ended up leaving because they were so horrible. I can't stress enough PLEASE  do yourself a favor and DO NOT use them.<//Review>

I think they are great, I had no problem at all. If you have all your paperwork and insurance papers in order then you won't have any problem. If you are unorganized and don't know what you needed to bring then that is on you. I picked up my car no problem at all, I was in and out in 15 minutes.<//text>

TERRIBLE place to rent a car! I would rate this car rental a no star if I could. I had the worst experience renting a car. I received the car dirty and it was overpriced! The manager was very disrespectful. Always take a video of the car when renting from this place because they would accuse you of a scratch that was already there before I got the key. I don’t recommend this place at all. The office was located at a staircase near an empty parking lot. As a girl I felt very unsafe going there alone.</Text>

I had a terrible experience with this car rental place. They tried to falsely accuse me of scratching the car.  Also, the car was dirty once I received the keys. The manager and the other workers were very rude and disrespectful. I had to pay over $100 for tolls even though I did not have to use it once. The office

They charged me for tolls even though there aren’t any tolls, they also claimed that we made a scratch on the vehicle even though I have a video of the same scratch, the scratch was the size of a quarter. She was very disrespectful, and called me uneducated, she claims she’s gonna claim it on my insurance, I will see you in court!</Review>

This particular rental car location isn’t run smoothly at all. When you call to reach out to them it’s difficult or get someone’s cell phone. I left something in one of the rentals. I was originally told they would call me hack to let me know if they located the item and I even e mailed them but I never got an e mail or phone call back. I called a few times and the woman stated they just throw everything away because of COVID-19.

I told her I wasn’t originally told that and I was upset. I waited and thought they would be able to hold the item for me. The young woman had a tone but I kept my cool about it. She was unprofessional and said if we didn’t call you then it means we didn’t find it. I said ok I understand that but I was told I would get a call back to let me know. She didn’t even ask for my name or number or the type of car I was driving.

I just wish they could be on the same page and communicate more efficiently. I understand mistakes occur but I waited almost two weeks for a response and that’s contacting them about five times. It’s just the point. I recommend going elsewhere to rent a vehicle.</Text>

<text>Don't believe these negative reviews. This place not only had exceptional customer service but was really easy to get to from the airport. My friend and I came from Canada and were a little worried about the 2.1 star rating but we figured it's so much cheaper then any other car rental. We gave it a try and we were surprised! our second day we were in an accident( a hit and run) and called the rental company. We did have insurance so the process was easy. When we returned the car they were polite, calm and understanding. They took  care of us and made it really easy. Thank you<//text>< Rating>

<review>Extra small lobby. You have show proof of full coverage insurance by presenting the page the says the type of coverage you have.  if you don't want their insurance. Who keeps vehicle insurance documents with them especially all pages! If you are a local renter you only can go 50 miles a day and not unlimited mileage!</review><userid>110882444016258194071</userid>< name>

Friendly, fast, helpful, clean. I will write more when finished with this rental.
Easy for me to confuse priceless with payless. Was a bit confusing for a new Lyft driver, too. Correct address for LAX is Airport Blvd. yet it is NOT on the street level with a storefront and does NOT have a big sign display anywhere. It IS on the fourth floor of the Renaissance Hotel on the corner of 98th and Airport. A to and from airport shuttle is the hotel's. They keep "regular" conservative hours. Best rates for non-locals on-line. Limited driving in the tri state of CA, NV, AZ. Proof asked for collision and liability insurance.< /text>

<Text>The site through which I was connected was Expedia and when I went to reserve my booking, Expedia allowed me to do so with a regular debit card and that was what I thought I could use to purchase a rental car. Which was not the case, I needed a physical credit card. In addition to this, Expedia and Priceless had no information clarifying that I needed to be 25 meaning that I had would have to pay extra for the daily costs. As someone who has no car and no means of transportation in LA, this inconvenience cost me over six hours of my day and I am thoroughly disappointed in Expedia as well as priceless car rental.<//Text>< pictures>

<Review>Worst experience ever. They are saying I damaged the car. But There was no inspection before and they used a signature from the office as inspection paperwork.

What a joke of an establishment.

It’s on the roof of a garage and they have no office.

DONT USE THEM!!!< /Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMiO4TVkj8yWRQjyXy46iF93uULk22DCbXZU8Gg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPYbi7XB56ONEWkH93I6paAS27b6uoQUV1gZS0e=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOEi70NKguNoZyC5yU7yfu2UDyQrgy3AI-RjIRD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< resp>

Eventhough our friend dropped us to pickup the car, if you are planning to get a shuttle to use their service, make sure to ask specifically which shuttle to use. Shuttle areas are color coded out side of LAX terminal. Also,  they are located on top of renaissance hotel  parking structure. Just go in and drive to the top.  A piece of advice. Make sure to inspect your car meticulously. Take pictures of questionable scratches and dents. Window scratched.  Overall our experience has been good. Great customer service. Representatives were nice and courteous. During pickup and returns. Shuttle runs every 20 minutes to the LAX. Driver was very nice.  Because of location and little effort to catch the shuttle just outside of hotel, I gave 4 Stars.< /Text>< Pics>

The cost of liability coverage was high erasing the all of the benefits of their lower quoted rental rates. They also opened an hour later (9am) than I expected based on some of their signage which said that after-hour drop off charges apply from 8pm to 8am. This was very frustrating since I needed to catch a flight and did not plan on the extra time necessary when doing an afterhours drop off.< /text>

They did not answer the office phone once over a period over several days. Listed Office phone is a  cellphone  and they dont return calls. Company charges for roadside assistance. Company operates under different than under reservation and is not listed with Google. Company will attempt to charge you with pre existing minor damages. The headache of this company isnt worth the savings. Estimated Rental $200 i was charged $700. I won the dispute is was refunded by card services.</review></record></dataset><record>

It’s a scam, they make you pay for stuff you don’t even use, when you return the car they make up there is a scratch on the car.  The office was on a staircase and it looked very shady. I felt unsafe. I highly don’t recommend it.<//review>

<review>Horrible service.  Tried calling them a number of times to find the location and then figure out what to do when our tire popped.  Naturally, they blamed us for their wear and tear.  They said we could drop it off Sunday at 8pm, the same time we picked it up 3 days earlier -- of course they're not open at that time.  Shady.<//review><user>102502885620940998390< /user><user_name>Lawrence Cisneros</user_name><GmapID>0x80c2b72e4448b437:0x8bd4f98236f405be<//GmapID>< Rating>

The place is easy to find inside the hotel. The only problem was getting on the shuttle for the airport pickup.
The shuttle bus has logos of many hotels printed on its body but the Renaissance hotel logo. This made us ask many shuttle drivers if they were going to the Renaissance hotel.
When we arrived to LAX, there was some shooting and some huge traffic. A shuttle driver from another hotel agreed to take us close to the Renaissance hotel due to the huge traffic, so we had to walk the rest of the way to the hotel.
The check-in process with Priceless was somewhat smooth. We were given a nice compact car which we really enjoyed.
Once we brought the car back, a lady inspected it and made sure it did not suffer from any damage. It was also a smooth process and did not take long.
We chose to use our debit car and made a deposit there. The deposit was returned to our account fairly quickly after returning the vehicle.
For the price we paid, I am so happy with the received service despite all the negative reviews on Google Maps.</Review>

Never again never again never again  This is the worst place to rent a car from they made me made a reservation online 20 days before the due date then when I get there they didn’t have my reservation for a minivan for a five members of my family and three suitcases and I was trying to fit me with a regular SUV or 14 passenger van, One of the ladies work there are terrible customer service she tried to kick me out never take care of me and when I tried to call to complain the company owner has really bad attitude and try to refund me just because they didn’t have minivan ready for me never again never again never again< /review>

Horrible experience may have ruined our memories of Disneyland. Took for ever to even find the shuttle to the rental office. Then the wait to get the van was very long. First van was filthy inside out. Felt rushed into signing waver and was hurried out once every thing was signed. Did drive only a few times once we were at Disneyland. When I returned it there was a smudge on front bumper. Wouldn't let me  leave until I signed a blank form and I was in tears by the time I left. I almost miss our flight home. Now 2 months later its 4 different damages  and they want  $3400 in repairs.</Text>

<Text>I never would have written this review if they have at least considered and treated as they would treat a customer. First of all their customer service is the worst. Next they don't even know what the name of their company is as they have multiple names (priceless, am/pm, nextcar) don't know what else. They are there not to help you but to make it a trouble for you to rent a car. I booked the car through them because of the low rate. But when I reached there they were asking me to add the insurance and stuff which I already had purchased when I booked the car.
Their cars are so dirty and old. The seats are stained and it is really old cars. I did a big mistake by renting from them. Never again and would like to give others a heads up.< /Text><UserId.>108714362632746407196< /UserId.>< Pics>

I did not rent a car from here but had a very good experience with them. A had parked my car in the parking garage where their rental company is located. When I came back from vacation my battery was dead and needed a jump. They kindly helped me. It ended up being quite difficult because of the kind of car I have and the way it was parked but Jason persevered. He even hung out to make sure I got out of the garage ok.</text>

This place was horrible. Customer service was horrible. I was literally in line waiting to be assisted and 3 people ahead of me cancelled their reservations due to their sneaky fine print.
I honestly wouldn’t recommend you booking with this rental place. Trust me. Worst rental place ever. It’s located in a hotel and their office is ran by incompetent staff.
Oh, and if you don’t care and still want to book with them, make sure you record every scratch and detailed bump in your car. I had to point out to the staff the marks.<//review>

The whole check in and check out of the car was smooth ! The executives at the counters and delivery were so kind and polite.

Coming from an international destination, they explained all the insurances that have to be purchased that are applicable to the California State laws. This wasnt mentioned by our booking Partner Orbitz. I believe its totally fair on their part to make sure that the insurances are in order !

All in all, I am really happy that I went with Priceless car rentals and I can certainly vouch for them< /Text>< Pictures>

Reviews dont lie. They will charge your card WITHOUT authority and when you call, they say to send an email and NEVER RESPOND to it. What a joke company. I had to file a dispute with my CC company and this company fought it. 5 momionths later and STILL arguing. AVOOOOOOOID<//Text>

This place is completely awesome!! A super good price with terrific service. We took a free shuttle bus from the airport to get the to them, as per their easy to follow instructions, and did the reverse on the way back (free shuttle to the airport after returning the car). The car was really nice and the people who work at Priceless are nice too! We spent half what we would normally have spent on a car. Definitely worth a tiny bit of extra trouble (the shuttle).</review>

My experience was without any issue. The car was new and clean. The service was decent. The return went without any problems as well.

I would recommend ubering to the location instead of the pickup bus.<//text>

<review>Horrible customer service. They took forever to check us in and get our car ready. We left about an hour after the time we had made the reservation for. They were also really sketchy with the walk- through, so make sure they mark all the sketches. Don’t sign the form until you know that they’ve done a thorough inspection, and you’ll have to hound them to actually be thorough.
So then the car we got was pretty dirty, stains all over all the seats, and it smelled weird.
It was pretty cheap, but honestly I would never rent from them again. It definitely would have been worth it to pay a few bucks more for a legit service.
Not recommended.< /review>< pictures>

THIS COMPANY IS SCAM. Do not lose your time, even if the reservation is free cancellation. Dont lose your valuable time with this company - if it can be called a company. They have a little table at the garage of a hotel, and they pretend they rent cars. I had a reservation, went to pickup the car, but they didnt give me the car without paying for insurance, which as I always do, refused to pat for since I use the one on my credit card. TOTAL SCAM. Will report them to all relevant agencies.<//Text>

Worst experience with a car rental agency yet. I travel alot. They are cheap at first but try and get you everywhere they can to make up for it. I will do my best to steer any one away they have no concept on how to run a business. I wish I had read the reviews on them before booking. Spend the little bit extra and go with avis or enterprise cause in the end you will be paying more with priceless.

SHADY COMPANY with no business ethics what so ever.<//Text>

My family and i had a smooth car rental experience through priceless car rental. Being my first time using a car rental company, I must say I am pleased with the whole service. The front desk was kind and helpful and the car itself was in great condition. We’re definitely using their service next time we fly into lax.</review>

They'll jack you on extending your car and won't just let you rent another car for cheaper because "it's in your agreement." So while it's cheap from the beginning, if you think you can just do an extension go with someone else.<//Text>

The car had minor cosmetic imperfections but drove just fine.

You'll want to make sure you read their policies before showing up as you need to prove that you have state required insurance (or buy theirs) and have a debit or credit card that can handle the rental and deposit.< /Review><username>Marcel Coffman< /username>< resp>

Booked online, arrived and waited An hour just to process the paperwork and get rental vehicle. I would definitely not recommend going to this place to book your car rentals. There are plenty around LAX, that don’t take an hour you’re in and out within five minutes you don’t have to pay all these extra fees. If you do book with them and arrive, then anticipate an hour to Hour and a half just to get your car. Also anticipate paying a bunch of fees. Make sure you pay attention to your receipt, as they will “accidentally” Charge you for something and you have to make sure you get the refund at the same exact time. Worst experience ever. Make sure you take before pictures of the car before you leave. The chubby Hispanic lady really tried me trying to charge me for some extra fees< /text>

<Text>No accommodations for pick up at the airport.  We were taken by bus with multiple stops to a dark lot.  It took over 2 hours to get a car that we prepaid for.  After calling several times, they said a van was coming to pick us up, we eventually had to uber to the place for safety.  We were literally on the side of the street.  Do not rent from them!< /Text>< Pictures>

The most important limitation is that they close at 8:00 PM. If your flight was delayed, you are out of luck. The LAX site is small, so you may have to wait a fair bit. The minivan we got was brand new, we had agreed on an  SUV, but it served us well.<//Text>

Absolutely horrendous. Unclean, old, and base cars. Horrible customer service, they're located on the 4th floor of a hotel, difficult to find. Just an overall bad experience. Would absolutely not recommend, I plan to dispute the charge after they gave me a lower class car and charged me for a premium.</Text>

<Review>They are now trying to claim we damaged the van we rented. We rented a newer van for one week and it was dirty inside and out. when my wife returned they took forever finally pointed out a small smudge on front bumper and would not let her leave until she signed a form that was not copied and given to her. She almost missed our flight home and was so upset and had been crying. now 2 month later it is 4 different areas on the van and 4 different claims , 4 different deductibles .Thankfully my insurance  company  has my back.< /Review>< Pictures>

We made sure to show extra kindness and they did the same. When we returned the vehicle there was another young lady there who was also very nice and checked us in fastI got a great price through expedia on a compact SUV and they upgraded me for free because they were out when we arrived. The 2018 van was nearly new and in great shape for the 10 day trip.</Review>

<Rating>1< /Rating><review>I am giving them a 1 Star review because I do not see the option to give a 0 Star review. We showed up to pick up a rental at LAX and it took them an hour to help us, there was only one person ahead of us in line. There were two people in the office and both of them were working on other things and did not even acknowledge us nor the other customers in front of us. The car was visibly wrecked and they made note of this so I would not be charged but I still expect to get a vehicle that does not have obvious damage to it.

I was not aware that a $200 deposit was required at the time of picking up the vehicle. When they tell me I need to provide a US major Credit Card I tell them I only have my debit card so they charged me a $20.00 non refundable fee to do this. I returned the vehicle and it was quick and they checked the car and said that everything was good but gave me no documentation saying that the vehicle was in a good shape or anything. They told me that the refund of the deposit would be processed the day i turned in the vehicle and could take 5-7 business days to go back to me. I waited the 7 business days and then called in to check on the status of the refund. When I called the call center, they told me that it was not their priority to get me my refund and that because I used a debit card it would take 7-15 business days to get my refund. I waited again and called back after 25 business days had passed. I asked to speak to a manager and the person said they were the manager. I could not understand him so I kept asking him to repeat himself and he grew very upset and unprofessional. He told me that they should not have accepted my debit card and that he did not know what to tell me. He began to yell at me and then when I told him that I was a customer and he was being unprofessional he told me that he was not and that I was wrong. As I continued to ask him questions about getting MY MONEY back, he grew more upset and continued to yell and be rude. I will never go back here again and will not be surprised if I never see those $200 again.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Horrible operation!!! ADVICE: make a second reservation with alternate rental company in case you get screwed by Priceless LAX. I wanted to give them a try. However my experience is my first and last one. I arrived to find my car was not ready, dirty interior and trunk, and not even a full size one. After 40 minutes later, they offered me a mid size SUV that just came back. Essentially the attendant took the keys from the last driver and gave them to me. The car was not cleaned or disinfected. Ewwww!!! Just given a quick visual "inspection". By then I was not prepared to wait for another "10mins" for a **cleaning**. I left Priceless after their rude explanation and service. Good thing I had a plan B. :) Beware!!!</text>

Deep scratches and dent from bumper to bumper, missing two hub caps and the passenger door was a different color. The interior smelled like cat hair, dark black stains on the seats, roof and floor boards as well as large and small holes all over the vehicle.

Horrible, Horrible, Horrible! These young ladies obviously don't care about their job, their lazy and have no sense of urgency! They charge for any and everything.... I rented my vehicle over two weeks ago, returned it and I'm still waiting on my $200 hold? These people need to be out of business..what a joke of an establishment!<//Review>

Do not rent from this company. Beware if you go online to book via hotwire you will or may be renting from this company. I have had a 3 month dispute for a car rental I never got. I went to pick up the car and the 2 girls running the service on a roof top of a hotel...which by the way they show some bogus office photo (never was that office). Not sure what that was because when I got there it was some little box with one girl behind a small computer. The room was smaller then a bathroom. The line was all the way out the door with all of us trying to pick up our car. People returning cars and 10 people including me to pick up a car. One guy driving the car and one girl with a clip board and one at the computer. Needless to say I showed up on time; even early but was never able to get my car. I tried to speak to the girl at the computer to confirm my pick up but was told to wait in line. So I waited for 30 minutes. Than tried again to speak with someone but was unable to since the girl with the clipboard was busy arguing with a guy about damage on one of the cars. Needless to say I was unable to get the car and they made me late to my appointment and I had to have someone else drive me. I tried to cancle with the girl at the computer but she keep having me wait and line they charged full price for a car I never got.  Beware of booking with them and do not do a prepaid what so ever or you will never get your money back.<//Text>

Easy to find, but its located in a parking lot, not enough employees, takes a very long time to get the paperwork done and there is no place to wait. At the end paid the same amount like we would with other companies.</review>

WORST CAR RENTAL EXPERIENCE *EVER*

Alex "Al" lied multiple times to me, including denying a staff with the name I mentioned works there (but later I met her and she works there) just so he doesn't have acknowledge her promise!

He is very  complicated and twisted things and lied on the calls to weasel through a scammy behavior.

He finally scammed me out of $1000 by faking an accident that never happened, and not only he charged my credit card for the $1000, he tried to scam my insurance company. I told them not to pay him. His collection agency threw the case back at him once they realized it's a scam.

Finally he refunded the money the day before I go file in Superior Court.

AVOID this place. If you're desperate to rent from this place, take pictures and videos of everything and record everything and be prepare for the chance to get scammed, and having to spend enormous amount of time getting involved in totally creepy, twisted  conversations with Al and if you want to fight back,  good luck, you can win, but it will suck your time. AVOIDing renting from this place is the best move. That's my opinion.<//review>

Sketchy small broomcloset operation piggybacking inside of a renaissance hotel. Hard to find and poorly managed. I recommend staying with major car rental companies rather than Priceless. The car itself was your typical car but the hassle to obtain it is not worth it. We wont use them ever again. Very slow service. Also the shuttle only comes to/from priceless once every blue moon, meaning you may miss you flight. The shuttle is a hotel shuttle and hard to spot at the airport. Pay $20 more dollars to book with a major rental company and avoid this company. Worst shuttle experience ever, ALMOST MADE US MISS OUR Fligt< /Text>

I am absolutely appalled. I could not pick up a car that I reserved online and that I PAID IN FULL beforehand because of a flight delay. When I arrived at the airport, they told me that they would charge me $100 just to send someone to get our car ready because their office was closed. They told us we could pick it up the next day, no problem. The next day they said they would NOT give us a refund for that day we could not drive the car. In fact, they would CHARGE US MORE for picking up the car on a different day.
Their policies are absolutely ridiculous. They will try anything just to get a customer to pay more. Absolutely backward fees that make no sense. Save yourself a lot of time and money, and do not come here. It is not worth their "low prices".</text>

the rental facility was a tiny closet on the top of the parking
garage.  Although there were 4 people working, it still took
an hour to pick up our car.  The reserved car, a Toyota
Corolla, was not available at our pick up time so wewere
given the option to take a Jetta or wait an hour forCorolla.

Another customer was returning their car and they were
arguing with the rental car agents about policies which did
NOT reassure me that this rental was going to bea smooth
one.Will not rent again< /Text>

Worse place ever. Priceline listed them as Nextcar Rental once we got there differen name entirely. I reserved a full size car which they charged for a full size car. When the representative took us to our car it was a small compact car. I asked her why didnt she say anything before she charged our account.  She had nothing to say she oh I was gonna tell you. They are shady and scammers. The car was stained and dirty tons of damage on the car.  We cancelled the reservation right then and there. I couldnt only imagine what would happen if we did rent from them. Went across the street to Budget slight a difference in money wise but well worth it.< /review>

Terrible rental experience
Off site and transportation extremely slow - paid for a minivan because we have 5 people plus luggage - got there to find out no mini van and no car large enough to match that size - no previous text or message telling us that information so our whole week in CA we were crammed in with our luggage in a small SUV - no partial refund either - very upsetting - then find out in return they opened at 9 not 8 as advertised - we left keys in lock box and note says we will be charged $20 for doing that - if so I will be demanding a refund because we were never told that - place is filthy and poorly managed - will never do it again - if other airports have good Priceless rental businesses then you should shut this one down as it forever tarnished your name in a terrible way</text>

<Review>The worst rental car company I’ve ever had, I don’t wanna put no one star for this place I don’t recommend anyone at all. I’ve actually reserved Hyundai Santa Fe for 10 days from Expedia website. Also I’ve paid by credit card online to reserve the car , but when I came to pick up the car suddenly they said the Hyundai Santa Fe car is not available, you can take similar cars. Actually I didn’t like the similar car and all cars in this place are dirty and not good for driving especially my car that they gave me, it was not clean. I was forced to take any car, so they gave me Hyundai Elantra  and in the middle of the week the car screen appeared service required while the car with me and I am driving the car as well.

This is the first time and the last time< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<user_id>112267936849262078611</user_id><Pics>None</Pics><text>Do not rent from here. I had no issues up until the point of return. They aren’t a 24hr car rental so I got there as soon as they opened so I could catch my flight. The desk clerk did not get to the counter until 8:18 am!, almost twenty minutes late. Now if it wasn’t for there strict off-hours drop-off charge I would have left the keys in the drop-box. Finally when the lady arrived late to work, I confronted her about being late which is completely unprofessional. She said I should have left the keys in the drop-box, which is not there policy unless you want a surcharge. They also have had the original deposit hold on my credit card for almost a month, responding that it’s the credit cards fault. I left a well below average survey, and yet to hear back from that. Stick with a more reliable car rental company, this place isn’t worth the headaches for value.< /text>< Rating>

Rip off and rude!!! Buyer Beware!!! Compact car  was reserved on Travelocity‘s website for $38 for three days and as soon as I arrived at the desk the customer service rep says Travelocity is not allowed to rent their vehicles and their price not including the deposit was almost $150 with the deposit it totaled $330!! I wasted all morning on the phone with Travelocity customer service and with Priceless Car Rental. DoNT Do It and go anywhere else please. I wouldn’t wish this place on my worst enemy<//text>

<Text>Don't be a prey with cheap rental rates - I had took many rental cars in the past with major rental companies and never had problems. I tried this company for cheap rental rates. I extended the car for one day and they charged  atrocious 50% of the rental rates of the 5 days. 2 - When I returned the rental car, exacerbated damages mentioned and slapped with a 3XXXX$ bill + Administrative charges. This is going to hike my insurance premium long term. I will never rent from this company and renters beware!< /Text>< Pics>

<Text>This is a horrible place to rent from!!!! I rented a vehicle on 7/2/18-7/10/18.  I used a Credit card and not a debit card.  I returned the car with no problems to the car.  I asked the worker if I would recieve my deposit back within a week and I was told yes!! Today is 7/21/18...and the deposit is still pending!  Called priceless and was told well you just have to wait or call your credit card company.  Then the representative hung up on me.  By using this company I didn’t really save that much money.  My fiancé thought it was a better deal than enterprise rental company...HE WAS WRONG!!! This was my first and last time using this horrible car rental company.  I did call my credit card company and thankfully they will release the pending charge..just don’t use them!!!  If I could give a no-star rating I would!!<//Text><rating>1< /rating><GmapID>0x80c2b72e4448b437:0x8bd4f98236f405be<//GmapID>< userid>

Avoid by any means necessary. Took over an hour to get my reservation , reps had me sign damage form before even looking at the vehicle. Claimed I caused damage that was already there so now I have to fight the charges. Also took over 45 mins to turn in vehicle, nearly making me miss my flight. I would not recommend at all , under any circumstances.< /text>

Do not recommend! Take your business elsewhere. Atrocious customer service after a stolen credit card situation while on a long vacation, after paying in full.

Very quick in and out, and then did not push to try and sell the insurance deals at all, which made it a lot nicer experience since I usually don't want any with my own insurance I have, and they so often keep asking insisting that my insurance doesn't cover what I need. There was no deposit, but they did require to charge upfront for the cost of the week.<//Review>< pictures>

I was on the phone with my husband and literally writing this review as he was engaged in a full- blown out “discussion” with Gloria at the Priceless Car Rental  LA location.   My husband experienced  THE WORST car rental experience EVER.  After being charged $200 which is typical,  he was then they asked for insurance....oh wait.....Gloria insulted my husband about not trusting he had any insurance and grilled him about it.....then asked he present it. It was on the lines of asking her “if she was a legal citizen and to please present your green card now or else!!”    Under normal circumstances I would have never made a comparison like this due to all the turmoil in our world today,  but this wasn’t normal and Gloria’s behavior was degrading and unprofessional. How dare she!!

The car was FILTHY and my husband asked someone to please clean it or give him another car. Gloria, told my husband she would just go ahead and cancel his reservation because he asked if the car could be cleaned- just enough for him to not be skeeved by the foul order and remnants of food from the last renter.

My husband asked for the manager and Gloria told him he was busy.  WHAT KIND OF BUFFOONERY IS THIS?? Keep in mind I’m on he phone with my husband while all this chaos is happening.  I have NEVER witnessed such foolishness in my life, especially with something as minuscule as renting a car.  She took a rag and wiped another vehicle down and rented it to my husband.

Unfortunately, due to time constraints and other factors my husband was reliant on this car rental. Trust me I tried to get him to somewhere else, but we were concerned about getting our deposit back and timing was the determining factor in keeping this car.

Now after reading other reviews, I’m very concerned about a timely return on our deposit as well as them honoring the unlimited mileage they advertise.  A frigging nightmare of great proportions.

Please use another car rental service. Please.<//Text>

don't go there  .. horrible   customer service  -- terrible  phone assistance  -- the car was  given dirty  and scratched all over  --  be very careful that all scratches are reported  in the pick up sheet, --  i arguably added a scratch on the front bumper and they made pay for the full paint job although it was already scratched all over  -- if have to take a car from them at least make sure it is fully insured.  They are a total scam !<//review>

Do not rent a car from them! Otherwise you will regret. They gave me a car with a very heavy bad smell. I am very disappointed and very sorry to work with this company. I won't work with them anymore!</text>

Worst rental car experience ever!! Will end up paying more at the end so save your money and time. First off they gave us a car that another customer just brought back at the exact time we were signing paperwork without cleaning it or even checking it throughly!!! No pictures were taken or anything before I received the car they just handed me the keys while checking out the previous customer then when I returned the car they claim that they have pics but they wont show me nothing!!!! When I arrived there was only one employee her name is rose I believe and she is the one who checked out the previous customer and also was dealing with me at the same time so she was in a rush and she didnt check the car before or taken any pics that she claimed that she did . So they wanted to charge me $500 for a small minor scratch on the front pumper that u can barely see which definitely was there before and now they have an insurance claim which feel like they charge u minimal amount for rental then they get u back with stuff like that which feels like a total scam!!!!
Will never rent there again....<//Review>

<Review>Avoid at all cost. Location opened late on Saturday, i had a flight to catch, me and 2 other clients were waiting for staff to arrive. 2 of us dropped off the key in the night deposit and they charged 20usd. We had a flight to catch and we waited 30 minutes for them to open and NO ONE showed up at opening time. I emailed them and no answer, just a charge on my credit card, I will dispute. Terrible terrible terrible. Oh and the hours of operation on Google are inaccurate.< /Review>< Time>

Avoid this place.  First of all, the place is impossible to find.  You have to walk through the lobby of the Renaissance Hotel to the parking garage elevator, go to the top floor, and there they are.  No signs anywhere.  Then, they wanted proof of insurance - make sure you bring that if you end up renting through them.  Now, here comes the fraud.  When I booked the car, it clearly stated that I got unlimited mileage.  When I got to the location, after wasting a half an hour getting my insurance company to email coverage details to Priceless, the lady at the desk informed me that I get 100 miles per day with the reservation.  Not unlimited miles.  She said that the reason for limited miles is that I was considered a "local" renter and that I would thus not get unlimited miles.  I went back to check the terms and conditions on the Orbitz website (where I booked) and it said nothing about this.  More importantly, I'm not a local renter.  I have a California driver's license, but I do not live in the Los Angeles area.  I explained all this, and the woman demanded that I produce a boarding pass.  I showed her evidence that I was flying out of LAX in a couple weeks' time, but she wanted to see a boarding pass that showed that I was on an airplane today.  Bottom line, this place advertises very low prices, but it's in incredible inconvenience to use them.  They bait and switch - advertising unlimited mileage but not actually offering it.  I would highly recommend renting a car from a more established and reputable outlet.< /text>

This place ruined the first day of our family vacation. They left us out in the hot sun for an hour and a half, while I missed my nephews playoff football game. I have recorded phone calls off them telling me they would come 8 times at 15 minute intervals for an hour and a half. By the way this is the first time I have ever posted a complaint about any services.and I'm 49 years old. Can't wait to hear what this manager has to say. To bad I had to post one star I needed a negative star for this awful experience.< /Review>

What a nice posh hotel made me stand up straight suck my  Gut in  and  in and stick my chest out. Once I found the elevator got up to the 4th floor parking the girls were very nice.. And scored a new   volkswagen  passat that just drove me all over Southern California and hardly used any fuel Clean inside and out I'd recommend this service to anybody who's going to use a rental car in LAX</Text>

If you want something cheap then go for this company. If you want attitude, then go for this company. If you want to be nickle and dime, then go for this company. If you want to wait a long time to get the car, then go for this company. If you don't want to be helped, then go for this company. If you don't want cooperation, then go for this company. If I could rate this company any lower then my God I would. If you have low expectations, then have even lower expectations!!!!< /review>

They are not at the airport and are not a 24 hour operation so if you are like me and come to drop off the car there may not be anyone here.  I called the number to ask how I was to get to the airport and was told they do not have a shuttle service. Luckily I was able to convince the hotel they are located in to allow me to use their shuttle. I hate to think what the difficulties may have been if I broke down in the middle of the night. If you're on a tight budget then going through all the little hassles may be worth it.

<username>Levy Jason<//username><time>1532305838271<//time><rate>1</rate><Review>More like 0 stars! Worst car rental company ever. When we got there we had to argue with a staff member about insurance she said we have to buy, though we told her that we were covered by my credit card, but the sales person thought she knew more than the Amex customer service rep! She only gave up after we told her to call Amex herself! After she wasted 1 hour of our time, and we finally got a car, it was completely dirty and smelled bad. We had to tell them to please clean the car as food leftovers were left behind all over the floors and at least they apologized saying they did not have time to clean it...really? So we should just be ok with a dirty car? :( Then there was also no windshield washer fluid which he had to replace. After 3 days on vacation it rained and we had to find out that the wiper blade rubbers  were hanging completely off the blades, totally unusable, so we could not drive the car at all that day. We called the rental place and they told us that normally it doesn’t rain at this location therefore they never check the wiper blades! Well, that didn’t help us at all, neither did them telling us to go to an auto part store and buy new ones! First off, it was already raining hard, so how to even get to the store 20 miles away? Secondly, we have better things to do on family vacation. After we told them to bring us a new car since this one was unreliable to the weather, they told us to wait 5 hrs and they would get back to us, but as expected we never heard back from them!
Needless to say that my family and I would never rent from this place again...Unprofessional staff and dirty cars!</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>{'time': 1532363186773, 'text': 'Hi Levy, We are very sorry to hear about your negative experience renting from us.

<text>The worst customer service , take’s a few hours just to pickup the car. Rushed car checks leads into errors in paperwork. They brushed off already existing minor damages(scratches) in the beginnng without recording it on the paperwork and points those same minor damages when you return the car. Blaming it on you so they can collect money from insurance.</text><Name>vivian t<//Name><pics>None< /pics><rate>1< /rate><Response>{'time': 1532965835078, 'text': "Hi Vivian, thanks for your feedback.

< Review>
I dont write too many reviews but I had to show some love to priceless /ampm car rental. They gave me a rate that blew all the big boys out of the hemisphere. I had a nissan maxima ( for what i paid total i would of been happy with anything really). The rental agent was very professional and really showed interest in her work . Oh before i go any further i worked for a big rental company for a few years , and i know that price and expectations sometimes bump heads. Im the type if im paying less then what everybody else is paying im happy . Some people expect a hummer for a fiesta budget. There are times cars break down . Other reviews about these guys made me on edge . But trust me , put your faith and cash with these guys. Sorry im kinda repeating things , but hey i tryed em liked em and will definetly rent again. Thanks guys . See you soon

06/02/2017*************************
The review needs revising.  I rented recently thru priceless rent a car and the experience was going as well as expected. I had a white  toyota Camry with dealer tags instead of license plates . I didn't think anything of it untill i got pulled over arrested and the car got towed . Now the thing with the authority's was resolved i tryed to get the car out of impound the next day . I felt it was the right thing to do but looking back now thier lack of a license plate is what i was pulled over for in the first place smh. I couldn't get the car out at first since I was not the owner of the vehicle . So mr AL the owner took me and we went and got the car out . It cost me 217 $ to get the car out of impound which I paid . Knowing now what transpired after this i would have been better off by sending mr AL to go pick up his car and pay that fee. To add insult to injury this miserable excuse of a human being  tells me I scraped the front bumper i told him it was like that when the agent rented me the car we both spotted it and pointed it out with writing . Now he's trying to embezzle me moneys that I supposedly owe him. Rosa if your reading this honey find yourself another job cuz this piece of rubbish will soon be closed . I told him I know your company is not profitable right now but going this route is not the way.Do not rent here . Do not ever speak with Mr AL. I'D rather be in a room with Ted Bundy trading shiv shanks then ever rent from here</Review>

<review>Overcharged!! I returned the rental car 4 hours early just to be charged an extra $23.89. They told me they have to pay for parking spaces which is ridiculous!!!
So if I didn't rent the car they would have paid for parking space anyway.  WHO CHARGES  CUSTOMERS FOR  parking the COMPANYS CAR ON COMPANY PROPERTY???.</review>< pics>

Worst car rental I’ve ever dealt with, charging me full detailing and 2 day charge for what should only take 30 minutes to clean and have ready to go, and when I called them about it, told me if I keep talking about it any further that they are going to further charge my credit card,  if I don’t know when to shut my mouth & accept the charges.</text>

Super fun area! My bf and I actually never found the arch rock because we got so distracted by all the rock formations on the way. Embarrassing, I know, but we had a blast exploring and climbing around the rocks. Coming around every corner and angle gave unique and stunning views. We’ll just have to come back to find the arch and try not to get too distracted. We ran into other hikers who couldn’t find it either, so it seems like this may be a common phenomenon.

Also, for bathrooms, go to the nearby white tank campground.<//review>

Arch Rock Nature Trail is a fun place. There's a parking lot nearby. The trail is fairly well marked. Arch Rock doesn't stand out right away. You have to read the signs. It wasn't as big of an arch as what I thought it was going to be. Wear good shoes or hiking boots, as there are rocks and boulders to climb on. Great views too!<//text>

<Review>85% flat trail with down hill incline to the arch, you feel the burn on the slight incline back to the trail head.
Last bit of the trail was through the rocks.
Easy trail, kid friendly, no bathroom at trail head.< /Review>< Pics>

Maybe it was better the end of our day and last on our must see list, but this was our least favorite. Glad we went but liked other must sees better. Everyone was having the hardest time finding it. People were walking around like crazy asking if anyone knew where it was. The park could absolutely do a better job making it easier to find< /review>

The site is right next to White tank campground.  Pretty simple trail to the rock.  The best part is the rock scrambling up to the rock and all the scrambling around the site.  Definitely a fun time to bring kids and see great views.<//Text>

So beautiful and an adventure. Make sure you take plenty of water and wear sunblock. It's a hike to get to the trail and it's open desert until then. Take lots of photos.</text>

So I thought this was closer to the parking lot but it’s probably 30-45 minutes to see this.  It’s sort of hidden away in the rocks.<//Text>

Awesome mind boggling sight to see humongous sized boulders piled together.  Boulders are a medium course sand composition that provides grippy surface for climbing. The walk from the parking lot is easy.  The last section necessary to access and see the Arch Rock formation is of medium difficulty if you're in decent physical condition. Older Elementary age children likely need to be strong and agile.  Some areas require a squeeze through. Much of the last leg to access and see the Arch Rock face on requires climbing.  Doable with flip flops which I wore.  Shoes are much safer for mounting up onto rounded boulders. A 24mm lens on a full frame 36mm camera can capture the Arch Rock. A panorama of three horizontal widths with the 24 mm lens is impressive. If walking in the August 100+°F heat,  a nice broad rim hat and sunglasses help.   Bring and drink lots of water.</Review>

<rating>5<//rating><review>My favorite hike in the entire park! If you're camping here, this is definitely the best spot to explore. There is not a lot of parking otherwise, so get here early! The trail is relatively short, but it offers a lot of opportunities to hike and spend a whole day. Definitely watch the sunrise and sunset, the lighting is superb!<//review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO3UA2bvCva1Rq84RhbHWfF7eV_Uwk1dgEDTMG6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMIv-pf6jXEnou297Mm1EWtf7Rk8qnxTEkzW_XJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM0jruKTHEjEFpusGXYaHqR9--oQYRQcLBuVoY_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipORI73gT0jGlhhszgFSW9E00XszxGYsYcL5E6XD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMHgqf71ig-CbqJkCKZRt683QxlXHKI0DjRKxKd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

<Text>This was an awesome experience! We parked at the parking lot right of the main road and did the hike to Arch Rock (.37 miles, if I remember correctly). It is a level, easy hike. And it was very much worth it to see arch rock and all the other rock formations around it. It was great!</Text>< rate>

The trail disappears after about 50 feet. Fortunately I heard some talking to the East and did boulder scrambling to find it. Only took about 10 minutes to get to it. Great to see, but good luck.< /text>

The path starts in the White Tank Campground near the Pinto Basin Road. It is a short, easy, and flat hike that takes you to the impressive 30-foot granite arch: the Arch Rock.</Review>

Definitely a must see trail in the park. The Arch rock is cool for a photo but the granite rock formations along the trail make for some awesome climbing and scampering. I spent a solid 45 minute hopping around the rocks.</Review>

<review>Trail is a nice short walk that can be taken from either a parking lot off the main road, or from the nearby campground. Arch rock itself is pretty great, however the trail there is pretty great and just as good as the destination. No toilets at the main parking lot, however the nearby campground does have a pit toilet. Be sure to bring extra water!< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80da9498921bae3f:0x632104cc9386eb2a</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Climbing all over these rocks was the highlight of my visit at Joshua tree! Didn't run into any rattle snakes but I'm sure they're out there. Saw a couple bunny's and unique lizzards. Don't forget to stop at appreciate what's out there. Joshua tree was very clean, let's keep it that way!</Review>

<review>On my motorcycle I rode straight thru,
So all I can speak to is the beautiful view.
The folded rock jutting towards the sky,
the arthritic Joshua trees demanding your eye.
The views are many in this southern Park,
So leave the highway. Treat yourself to a lark.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80da9498921bae3f:0x632104cc9386eb2a< /gmap_id></record>

We totally lost the trail for 20 minutes, walk way too far and loved it! There are many slits to explore and lots of picture opportunities. (In the end we did find the Arch)<//text>

We're delighted to hear that our community has met your expectations and hope that you won't hesitate to reach out to us if there's anything that we can do to improve your experience further. We sincerely appreciate your review and hope you have a fantastic day!"}< /Response><review>We just moved in and are happy so far. Clean and spacious apartment with new kitchen. No pests in sight. Maintenance staff has been super friendly and helpful with the couple issues we found at inspection. Laundry room just got updated machines that are paid via mobile app. Bertha was SUPER nice and helpful during our application process and lease signing. We are right on Balboa so it can get a little loud but can’t hear much with the double pane windows closed. Neighbors have been friendly also which is a major plus</review></record>

<Text>Joseph and Hector are two of the maintenance guys. They are really nice and helpful. One time Hector helped me move a really heavy piece of furniture. Joseph is really positive and has fixed everything that has broke at our apartment in a decent amount of time. He also makes an effort to get to know our names. Great guys that represent Barclay Square well.<//Text>< user_name>

<Review>It's been 3 months since my roommate and I moved into our 2-bedroom, 1-bath, and we've both been loving it. The apartment is spacious and welcoming after a long day of work. Both of us appreciate the little things such as:
- There is carpet in the bedrooms, while the rest of the apartment is tiled. The carpet not only makes the bedroom more comfortable, but it also helps cut down on the noise from downstairs neighbors.
- There is a solid wood door that pulls out of the wall in order to separate the living room and kitchen from the bedrooms. We were both pleasantly surprised with how much it cuts down on the noise between the areas. I can be gaming at a normal volume in the living room while my roommate can still sleep peacefully.
- There is a sink/counter/mirror setup in the master bedroom. This cuts down on time waiting to use the bathroom to get ready in the morning. My roommate just hops out of the shower and gets ready all in the master bedroom.

One main thing that we really like is the responsiveness from the office staff on property. We had put in a maintenance request to rehang the bedroom mirror that fell off the wall. After a couple days we were getting a little impatient, but once we reached out to Jason Vazquez, from the leasing office, he got the ball rolling. The mirror was rehung by the end of the day.
Jason also helped us with the process of actually renting the place. Being that it was my roommate and I's first time renting our own place, we had plenty of questions. Jason never tried to persuade me when I visited for the first time, but instead was very informative and educational regarding all the ins-and-outs. Jason was incredibly helpful and made the whole experience much less of a struggle than it could've been. If it’s your first time renting, I highly recommend getting in contact with him.

I would recommend this anybody looking for a good quality, basic apartment. Our stairwell neighbors are from all different walks of life but have always been courteous and friendly. This has been a great starter apartment for both of us!< /Review>< response>

Don’t do yourself a disservice by choosing to live here. I’ve lived here for 2 years and can promise you the cost of rent is not worth the experience of living here.

First off, the roaches issue is severely downplayed and when we reported it the exterminator that came said the issue was not infested enough to fog the apartment and recommended that we get roach bait traps (which we already had all around the apartment). Mind you, we are constantly cleaning around the apartment and frequently finding dead (and live roaches) on a daily basis.

Secondly, the appliances are all falling apart or not working and they refuse to replace them because we’re living in one of the “lower cost” apartments. In order to get maintenance to even come up and check out an issue, you have to call them under the notion of an emergency request as they will not come out if you put in a work request on the site. The toilet has terrible water pressure and is frequently getting clogged, the vents look like they have never been cleaned, there’s mold growing on the ceiling of the bathroom (and they promised us a year ago, during quarantine, that they would replace the bathtub and then never followed up), the knobs keep falling off, and drawers keep sticking because the paint is so caked on. Only one of our stovetop burners work at any given time, and honestly I could keep going with all the issues that keep adding up. One point for them though, at one point our faucet was broken and spraying all over the place whenever we tried to use the kitchen sink, and after putting in an emergency order, they came and replaced the faucet in a timely manner.

Finally, parking is awful on the street and the little alley that they have for parking has some seriously compact space,and you only get one spot per apartment, regardless of apartment size. Their site is also not functioning properly, so we can’t even pay rent online and instead have to purchase cashiers checks. Also, they have construction on this street all the time and block the ONLY EXIT from the tiny parking lot/alley without warning. It’s also super loud all the time (and if you want daytime entertainment, there’s people fighting in certain apartments so loud the entire complex can hear), especially if you live on the side closest to Balboa Ave. There seems to be zero insulation in these walls, and our neighbors are constantly banging on the walls adjacent to us at all hours of the day and night.

They spare no expense in making the exterior of the apartments look nice (all of the blue painting was done recently) to attract new and unsuspecting tenants, but do the literal bare minimum to actually make living here a worthwhile experience. I’m super grossed out by this place and can’t wait until my lease is up to leave.</Review>

<Review>Alicia and McKenzie have been super helpful in my moving process. Initially it was dissatisfying when I moved in. Covid has made moving challenging. I wanted to do an in-person tour of the unit to decide if I wanted to move in or not. At the time, those tours were not available due to Covid, which I understand why, but I personally think is an overreach. I found a virtual tour and the unit I wanted. It was renovated with new appliances, floors and carpet. I signed my lease and shortly after, I did my inspection of the unit. The unit I inspected was different than what I saw online. I had no time to dispute it because I was in the middle of a lot of things at that point in time. The next day I let management know about my disappointment and dissatisfaction. I wanted to stay in the complex because of the location and price was just what I was looking for. We talked for some time, and we agreed to work toward a solution. It just so happens there was the same unit available with the renovations I was expecting. They helped me out and got me into the new unit. There were some hiccups along the way, but in the end everything worked out. They were very reasonable and understanding. I Iet them know I was extremely grateful for their help.

I’ve lived in apartments before. The parking could be better, but I knew what I was singing up for. If they could fix a parking arrangement in the close future I think they could really make this a real stand out place.

I enjoy being close to my family, friends, church and close to a lot of other things. I am looking forward to finishing out my lease term. I really appreciated Alicia and McKenzie’s help during this process. If you are reasonable and respectful to them, they will certainly give to your what you give to them.< /Review>< pictures>

I recently moved into my apartment and my experience thus far has been great! The staff has been accommodating and made the moving process a breeze. The apartment was kept clean and maintained. Upon moving into the apartment the water pressure for my faucet was not working too great but I made a work-order and it was taken care of promptly.

I would love to give a shoutout to Yune at the front office. If you ever need anything taken care of just give her a call and she will do her best to take care of your needs.<//Review>

I had been looking at apartments in San Diego for a little over a month before discovering Barclay Square. I was able to view a unit the same day I called stating I was interested. I loved the 2bd 2ba unit Jason was able to show me and I applied the same day. I'm a planner so when things unfortunately did not go accordingly at the beginning of the application process (issues with 3rd party screening company) I started to panic knowing I needed to have a new place to live before the end of the month. Jason worked with me from start to finish. He was great about communicating with me via phone/email in a timely manner and was sure to answer/clarify any questions I had. I am able to pick up my keys to move in tomorrow and am so, so appreciative of Jason and everything he has done to assist me. I am more than excited to call Barclay Square home!< /Review>

I have lived at Barclay Square for a few years now and I love the improvement with the staff and with the renovations all around Barclay Square. I would also like to say that the manager Bertha is very pleasant.  It is amazing to see how quick she is to take care of an issue.  I have lived in other complexes where the managers brush the issues under the rug and they’re overlooked but not here. She has given me and my family the comfort in knowing we are being heard.  That says a lot about her.  I can honesty say that Bertha and the rest of the team are extremely courteous and nice. Thank you!<//Text>

<review>I lived here for over a year. I've always had very pleasant interactions with management, especially Yune who is great! My work orders have always been answered promptly, often same day if I stopped by the office or called. Parking can be a bit of a pain but there's streets nearby to park in and its a short walk. Sometimes neighbors can be loud but not anymore than most places. Just be aware of where your unit is situated (some units face a busy street). We did have roaches but pest control was scheduled promptly. A lot of these units are offered at really affordable prices and it's an ideal location and close to a lot of shopping centers. Love the updated look to the complex and how well maintained the grounds are.</review><gmap_id>0x80dc0075f6e39859:0xba5af3373417c31f</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I just moved in today so this is on my experience so far. The application process was very easy and Yune from the leasing office was amazing!! She gave me tours of a few different units and even let me come back to view a unit with a identical floor plan another day. My unit is very nice..nice flooring, huge balcony and you CAN NOT beat the location. For someone that doesnt drive it is so convenient to have pretty much everything you could need within a 5 minute walk. Yune has been SO HELPFUL with all of the questions I've had...she has always answered me right away. I'm not sure what the negative reviews are regarding but so far I'm extremely happy with my choice to live at Barclay Square :) Oh and my parking space is directly outside my apartment door...parking will be a bit of a hassle if you have 2 cars but seeing as though I have 1 not a big deal.< /Text>

Yune  in the leasing office is always does a great job at answering any questions I have or taking care of my requests promptly. She is very kind and empathetic and always has a positive attitude when we speak. You can tell that she actually cares about the well being of the tenants.the community is nice and great for families. No ridiculously loud obnoxious noises during the day or at night.

The only “problems” we’ve had were handled professionally and willingly by Yune in the leasing office and the amazing maintenance crew, especially Javier!! Javier has come to help with broken outlets, clogged toilets, thermostat problems, and paint jobs. He is efficient, polite, and friendly, and always willing to help. Thanks Barclay Square!<//text>

I've lived here for 10 years. Staff has been very friendly and helpful when called upon. Had a bug problem but they fixed that with no further problems. Have had to call Security several times for late night loud neighbors, but they've responded quickly to speak to them. Children sometimes leave toys and bikes strewn around, but nothing major.

Otherwise, living here has been enjoyable.<//Text>< response>

Personal experience of approx. 8months.
Yune, helped me move in within a week.
Friendly service, but make sure your proactive with reaching out to them and having your paperwork.

Interior is fair, did personal touch ups.
Prevent infestation, when you move in use a chemical to set a barrier for insects.(home defense) Use their free service of pest control.
Great location, walking distance to many dep.
For dog walking, good area 2 dog stations with doggie bags and trash. 3 parks near by 10min to 15min walk. Peaceful-personally.
Cars at times can be loud at Balboa Ave side.
Use maintenance and be proactive. If there is a problem call maintenance or request online. Latest can be 1 week. Good people, very respectfully.< /Text>

The office was very helpful and pleasant to deal with. Called and left a message to express interest and Yoon called back right away and told me what options were available and what specials were running. Very flexible with appointment time to tour the facility.  Choosing appartment option was easy and so was the application process. Yoon was also very good with updates on what was required before move-in and made the whole process seamless. Apartment was really nice and remodeled and I'm happy to say I'm settling in nicely.<//Review>

< Review>
Paint, Carpet Cleaning and Cleaning are NOT optional, but mandatory charges at the end of your lease even if you were only there for a year.  You should ask them how much those fees are so you can plan to not get it back from your deposit. I repeat, you will NOT get that money from your deposit. I had my apartment spotless, but it was a waste of time. They also made a mess on my balcony from the roofing with a bunch of nails then had the nerve to charge me for cleaning. Since they're charging me so much money I will retaliate with a lawsuit for endangering my life with nails all over my balcony. I have pictures of the mess they left.

My unit did NOT have cockroaches or bugs. My unit, for 5 months, was visited weekly by maintenance. It was weird as if they were spying on me or something. My toilet didn't flush correctly so I had to train myself on how to flush it so it doesn't run continuously.

If you are on the building facing Balboa St., you should really know that it's SUPER LOUD. You will not be able to open your window and expect to sleep. There's a lot of motorcycle traffic in the area and they get very loud all times of day and night.

Parking sucks. DO NOT get a 2bedroom here and expect two spots. The person without a spot will get very tired of parking very quickly. Trust me on that. Tons of people pack themselves in apartments so they have multiple cars. There's also multiple communities in the area and they share the same Beadnell Street parking.

Dogs are EVERYWHERE. It seems everyone has found a way to use the Emotional Support Dog excuse to have a dog for FREE. If you want a dog at this apartment, rest assured that you are 100% ALLOWED to as long as you tell them it's an emotional support dog. Also they do not charge you extra if it is an emotional support dog. Know your rights. ;D. Just a tip for those wanting a dog without the monthly baggage attached.

There is little communication from leasing office. Once there was construction in the middle of the sidewalk and they didn't send any courtesy notices like any other normal complex. How odd right?

For the money, you are better off looking for a similarly priced apartment that is not drowned by heavy traffic from Balboa.< /Review>

I just recently moved into these apartments and I would like to share my experience. Yune was the office worker who assisted both me an my roommate during this whole transition. While we had many technical difficulties in the process, she was very helpful and understanding. They were available to call and email for any and all questions. All of the information is put in electronically including the applications which would be hard to do if you do not have the means necessary. Other than my personal difficulties with the internet (apparently I am bad at it) they were always happy to help wherever they could. As far as the apartments go, the location is great, walking distance to many things. The complex is fairly quiet, no dogs or kids or parties. The neighbors I have met have been friendly. Parking here is rough and you will only be assigned one spot but there is ample street parking to both you and your guests. I have not yet used the laundry facilities or pool but they are kept very clean from what I can see. Thank you to Barclay square and Yune for all of your help and friendliness.<//text>

<Time>1563176208154< /Time><review>This place is not worth the money. People smoke marijuana right next to open windows blowing the smell into your home, scream fight at random hours of the day and night even after the police visit them, steal Amazon packages right off of doorways, and dig through the dumpster. Chances of finding parking is like winning Russian roulette with only one bullet missing. Some homes appear to have 2-3 families living in one place, which probably accounts for the lack of street parking. Most people park illegally by the fence and management does nothing, though they do try to give a scare at lease signing. The abnormally gigantic roaches still reside unchecked and the faucets make a strange high-pitched squeal when turned on anything below full force. The website says that the office is open on Saturdays. They're not. Learn from me and don't waste your time visiting during the weekends. Learn from my mistake and don't live here.<//review>< user_id>

<review>DON'T MOVE HERE! Since the beginning there's always been issues. They will bother you at least twice a month with water shut downs, unecessary "updates" to the builiding, always wanting to enter your apartment to do I don't know what. It is exahusting living here. To top it off, they have roaches, we had to ask for someone to spray the apartment every week for almost 4 months because of how bad it was! Can't wait for the lease to end. Never again!!!!!!<//review>< pictures>

Decent place for a decent price. The newly renovated apartments are visually pleasing, but we've had a few issues with things here or there (fridge/freezer shutting off since the outlet was fried, towel rack falling off, cockroaches, heating panel not working, wood floor paneling coming up to cite a few). The facilities team is helpful but I'd recommend submitting online then calling to get things done quickly. You get one parking spot for a two bedroom apartment and parking tends to get rough after 6pm, so plan accordingly. The Barclay Apt team leaves paper notices between doors notifying residents of current events including the monthly water shut-off hours (not sure why this is happening). The water tends to be shut-off from 10am-2pm, though, so it shouldn't affect you much as long as you have a 8-5pm full-time job or something similar. Any noises within the apartment structure tend to echo so children/dogs(a lot of service dogs in the apartments to evade the no pets rule)/music are quite noticeable. There's often new graffiti on the back fences by the parking spaces (it's constantly getting repainted), and there are often people sorting through the garbage bins collecting things, so it's not the most private apartment complex. I will say that I've never had a bad experience with any of the strangers. Also good to note that the Fire station is just around the corner, so you'll hear the occasional fire truck siren.<//review>

This place is a absolute disaster. Had roaches before I even moved in. Had the exterminator come every month and still would not get rid of them. No hot water unless i let the water warm up for at least 20 minutes. Maintance stated " you live in the last apartment to get hot water your just going to have to let it run". So my water bill was always expensive. Dont waste your time go elsewhere. Not worth the 2000 a month to have roaches and no hot water.</review>

Stay Away and Find Something Better! If I could give negative stars, I would given Barclay Square Apartments - and more specifically the current staff Jason and Eric at the leasing office at least negative 2. If you have looked at any of the positive reviews as some kind of reassurance before you decide to sign a lease here - don't worry, those are paid for by the leasing office through gifting.

Let's start with COCKROACHES. First let's recognize that I am referring to both the infestation of our apartment for the last 12 months and those working at the leasing office. When my husband and I originally moved in 2 years ago, there was a completely different staff, and there was not a constant influx of insects coming in through the walls, drains, and cabinets. If the question of resigning our lease had been with this current staff, we wouldn't have even considered. But the previous staff were actually sympathetic to us seeing an occasional cockroach, and promised us solutions so we did what any naive couple looking for 'affordable' rent in San Diego would do, and resigned our lease with a $250/month increase. What a mistake!

Here's where our story became a nightmare. Enter the new members of the leasing office and the increased cockroach infestation.

Did we continue to charge you last years rent with an unalterable autoplay WITHOUT NOTIFYING YOU FOR 5 MONTHS of underpaying rent and subsequently try to evict you with 3 days notice without explanation? Sounds like a leasing office with some integrity. But the integrity really becomes evident when you do pay that additional $1250 for the clerical mistake that this same new leasing office asks for. Let's talk about payment plans. The leasing office decided we could divide that $1250 of incurred expenses (from their mistake) into a payment plan for 3 months, which they would put an eviction notice (not folded) on our door, despite paying their payment plan that they set up.

But let's not get bored with money here, let's get back to the exciting prospect of cockroaches. Want a variety of carcinogenic chemicals sprayed weekly at no cost to you without actually resolving your problem of cockroaches in the walls? Look no further than Barclay Square!

Now that we have moved past the creatures, let's talk about the water shut-offs that happen weekly, with advanced notice only 50% of the time. If you're looking to commute to work without the ability to take a shower in the morning, this is your place. The best is when halfway through your shower the water gets shutoff with soap in your eyes. Brushing your teeth with bottled water is probably good for the soul, right?

Do yourself a favor, and look for apartments where the people who take your hard-earned money actually care about resolving your issues. If you're looking for apartments where when your sink is literally flooding your place, and you run to the office only to be met by a locked door at 8:58AM with someone who can see you and refuses to open the door until it is 9:00AM, than this is your place! Thank God we can finally move.<//Text>

<text>DO NOT MOVE HERE if you value sleep and your money!!!! There is a reason why there are so many vacancies here year round. They are either old units that break down frequently or they are cheaply renovated “modern” units with old unit problems related to plumbing, thin walls, mold, or other miscellaneous problems.

First off, the prices fluctuate daily when you first apply for a unit. Scheduling a tour of a unit you want is a coin toss - either you get to see it because the unit has been off the market for awhile or you don’t due to either necessary repairs, painting, renovations, heavy cleaning needed, or they just don’t want to show you because it isn’t “ready” to be viewed. If you see a price that’s a steal for the unit, it is first come first served; but beware - they will make you put down a holding deposit to lock in the price whether or not you were able to view the unit.

Now, onto the move-in process. If you were lucky, you got a unit that was a corner unit upstairs and didn’t need any repairs, had no pest problems, or didn’t need appliances replaced on the 1st day/week of move in. AND if you were more lucky, you have nice, quiet neighbors whom you can’t hear arguing, children crying/yelling/playing inside, dogs barking, or your neighbors’ tv/music/shower/vacuum/other loud sounds at odd hours of the day/night because your walls are well-insulated from noise. If not, be prepared to deal with all sorts of problems from day one of move in. Personally, I had an initial roach problem during the first week with a few dead roaches not being cleaned out of our kitchen cabinets, roach poop build up not cleaned from the top of and the inside of the metal thing that our vertical blinds sits on (the ones leading to the balcony), and 3 stray roaches that appeared here and there in the evening(s) that I immediately exterminated with my handy, dandy, rolled-up magazine. I also thoroughly cleaned my apartment with homemade cleaner from top to bottom and especially made sure to thoroughly spot clean the entire kitchen and the area around the sliding door leading outside to our balcony after every roach sighting. Haven’t seen one since.

Other things to note about this property:
- Laundry rooms are open until 10pm, machines are often out of order in each of the laundry rooms
- 1 assigned parking space so be prepared for parking wars on the side streets after 5pm (side note: some people park illegally behind the building where the oddly one way parking lot is located on the side close to Balboa Ave without getting towed)
- Noise complaints (dogs barking all night, music playing loudly at night, etc.) will not be addressed unless you want to call the cops on your neighbors
- This is a non-smoking community on paper, not in practice so stay away if you have kids or health problems
- Homeless people dig through the trash or wash their clothes in the sink in the laundry rooms
- No A/C in the units which can be avoided if you stay away from your place on those hot summer days or buy a window A/C unit
- Water shuts off occasionally with/without notice (85% they give notice)
- A good chunk of your deposit will be gone due to painting, cleaning, etc. whatever they can muster up so fight for your deposit during pre-inspection and after you move out
- Close to shops, a fire station, 805
- Friendly maintenance staff! (Hence 2 stars)

If you were able to survive your hopefully short term leasing period that they made somewhat affordable without any of the major problems previously mentioned, congratulations!! If you want to stay because it’s decently priced and you have a decent set up going on, do it. Otherwise, move out of here and find something better.< /text>< gmap_id>

Don't bother applying here, they don't let you check out the sample apartment until after you apply and pay fees. Also we payed with cashiers check for the last bill of water, but they charged us again when returning our deposit. Just crooks here. Only reason im giving them an extra star is because their staff is friendly and happy to help with maintenance of the apartment<//Text>

<Review>I've been living at the Barclay Square apartments for 5 years now and I love this place. it's next to everything, like Home Depot, CVS, Target, Vons, 99 Ranch Market, Marshall's and all the taco shops. There's all the banks and western union across the street. Everything is with-in walking distance too. I love the layout open floor plans. They're 7 pools with multiple laundry rooms that use a laundry card, instead of change or cash, because it's safer for the resident's. The pools are taken care of every week, They keep up with the maintenance and landscaping daily. The crew is awesome and funny. Parking might not be the best, but you can always find parking as long as you don't have more then 2 vehicles. The neighbor's are polite and nice and respect one another. The beach is 10-20 minutes away, the Bay is 10 minutes away. You get what you pay for and this is worth it. Great management crew. Keep up the good work Kristina, Ricardo and Michelle...</Review>< pictures>

The guy(middle age bald guy) at the reception was very rude, have the nerve to ask me if I cut in line at the office when obviously I did not, then proceed to ask the guy if I cut in line and then helped him first even though he said I did not cut. Then he talks down on me when I asked couple questions. On top of that, the apartment is not noise proof(very thin wall), you can hear upstairs people talking, walking and slamming the doors. Very limited parking spot. Cockroaches outside and inside of the apartment, it's an absolute filth. Won't be renting here with that kinda people working and horrid conditions.</Review>

I would give this place a zero if I could. My current issues are with paying rent through the website. I accumulated fees that I had no idea existed and no one informed me. Of course I will be fighting this in small claims; but outside of that nobody in management gets back to me. I have to go on multiple times a week to get what I feel like should be easy fixes and yet takes half a month to take of. I have been here around two years and have had so many problems. Don't waste your time here.

EDIT: Here I am many days later and the manger is avoiding me the team here is refusing to help me. I have sent many emails to the manager and talked with the team many times. On top of my own problems with the management team the property is becoming messier with children leaving items EVERYWHERE.

Edit: here is my last issue I’m having that I can’t wait to move out. Outside from pest control issues the water (which renters have to pay for btw) is constantly under maintenance or being shut off! This is my second and final year here and water is shut off at least once every 2 months. If they are going to constantly have the shut off they might as well pay for it!< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x80dc0075f6e39859:0xba5af3373417c31f<//gmap_id></record>

Barclay Square is possibly the worst place I have ever lived.

First of all, parking is terrible.

Second, water is turned off without notice on a regular basis. Once, I was in the middle of doing several loads of laundry and the water was shut off. They never refunded me for the laundry.

Third, the walls are incredibly thin. With noisy neighbors and a regular 5am wake up alarm, I never got a good night's sleep.

Fourth, the people in the leasing office are absolutely useless. Terrible customer service and not at all helpful.

I could continue to complain about how terrible this place is, but I won't. These are the largest gripes I have.

If I could rate this zero stars, I would. OH AND THE COCKROACHES :(<//Review>

Place looked nice, great area and seemed affordable but the management is horrible. Applying for this place was a pain in the rear. Applied the first week or two of June to get into a place that was open first week of July. Took a few days and they never got a hold of me. I had to bug them to find out about it. Getting a hold of them isn’t a easy thing either. I always ended up driving an hour to face them in person to find out what was going on. When I got there they didn’t even finish their part of the process so I had to wait again.  They said my application declined as well but that it is common due to computer errors/warnings but if I have proof they can be cleared, which I did. I went in person again and Eric calculated and looked over all the paperwork I provided as proof and said everything checked out financially and he gave the approval but needed general managers approval and then I’ll be set to do the next step which is deposit and contract signing. All this took a few weeks. Then again I had to get a hold of them to find out if I was approved and they said it looked good still but one more part had to be proved and to send it to email instead of coming cause it would be faster so that very day I got the proof they needed and sent them emails. The next day I called and nothing so I emailed and surprisingly got an email back only to say we got it will review it and get back to you. Waited a few days again... nothing. By this time It was already the end of the month and I moved everything into storage and living with friends and family along with my two kids believing that all I needed was that one step more. Finally got a hold of Eric a week later and then he said it still needed to be reviewed so they still didn’t do thier part and made excuses that they were so busy dealing with the first weeks payments from thier tenants and he’ll get back to me in a day or two. I stopped him there and said he had told me that a week ago and then said he’ll get back to me by the end of the day and he’ll put me on his list of to do’s. Never called me back. Tried getting a hold of them again. Left messages and emails and nothing. By this time it’s already the next month and a day after the day I was to move in if approved. Called until I got someone and I got a different person this time. He had no idea what was going on and started from the beginning then I told him the whole process I went through and put me on hold. Still told me oh we don’t see where this is coming from and I don’t understand the email you sent which were work checks, said let me call you back. I was nervous they wouldn’t again and asked they get back to me today cause I’ve been dealing with this for a week and half now. Luckily they called back after an hour this time and said we are still confused so we’re just going to have to cancel it. Are you kidding me?!!! A whole months process with an approval and a lead that all was going to be cleared and then leaving me in the clouds for weeks just to be told, we don’t get it so we’re not going to deal with it?!. It shouldnt take a whole month and a few weeks for an application process. Now I am left homeless and looking again. By the way spent about$100 on application fees. Ridiculous management!!! Good luck!</Text>

<Text>Don't waste your time applying for this place they are a huge scam! They kinda make it as though you should send in your application before you view the apartment. After you apply online and spend like 90$ (three people) on the application you get an immediate response that you have been denied (without any specification as to why you got denied). There are to major scammers there Michelle and her sidekick joe . WATCH OUT! I wish I saw rating before I got into it.<//Text><userid>110597675571980311759< /userid><gmap_id>0x80dc0075f6e39859:0xba5af3373417c31f< /gmap_id><Time>1437780969517</Time><pics>None<//pics>< Rate>

Dogs love Vintage because Vintage loves dogs. Simple as that. We have left our dogs a "the spa" for many years, during extended trips to Europe, and when we get back we find them happy, healthy, and perhaps even better than when we left. Vintage makes an extra effort to make sure the dogs hang out with comparable dogs and makes sure everyone gets along -- not always easy with our feisty Jack Russells. We are so grateful that a friend recommended Vintage many years ago.</review>

For personalized care of your puppy/dog, you can't find a better place than Vintage Kennel Club. My developing puppy LOVES going to "Vintage Day Camp" where she has made many furry friends with whom she is placed according to temperament, size, and age. The staff is outstanding, knowing the needs of each client (both canine and adult), providing feedback and guidance as relevant. Without reservation, I highly recommend Vintage Kennel Club!</Review>

They are very sweet and caring, and always have lots to say about my buddy when I pick him up after work. I don't know what else you would want for your dog for daycare; they play outside in groups, they swim, they wrestle, they get a nap, they don't wear muzzles, and the caretakers really know a lot about dog training and care. Great doggy daycare.<//Text>

Fabulous place to bring our dog. They are so friendly, honest, take great care of the dogs.  What I love is that they have a space for smaller dogs to go separate from bigger dogs with obstacle course.  Our corgi is tired out at the end of the day and that is saying alot for a corgi!!!< /Review>

Vintage Kennel Club has been caring for our large dog for several years and is the best kennel we've ever used! We board him when we go on vacation and use the daycare for occasional socializing and to keep things feeling familiar. He is calm and happy and no longer exhibits the separation anxiety behaviors he had at other kennels.The staff is both highly professional and very caring, and they create a positive environment for all the dogs.<//Review>

Highly recommend!  The staff was wonderful from our very first visit/tour to the initial day-long orientation, to being sure our 2-year-old dog would be comfortable and at ease for a week’s boarding (which he was).   We picked him up happy and tired.  Well worth the drive up from Southern Marin, and we will definitely be back the next time we need overnight boarding.< /Text>

VKC is the best pet care facility I have ever had the pleasure of knowing. I have an eight-year-old Labrador who has been a regular guest for many years. The fact that she gets to socialize and play with other dogs like her makes all the difference. I never feel guilty dropping  her off because I know she gets to have even more love and attention than she gets at home.  All of my interactions with the staff have been professional and caring. I would recommend Vintage Kennel club to any dog owner.</review>

We just love Vintage Kennel and so does our dog. We have not had good experiences with kennels in the past- dogs coming home sick, stressed out, etc. With Vintage Kennel our dog is excited to go and completely worn out from all the fun he’s had when we pick him up.
They are conscientious about the dogs being healthy and vaccinated, and are very attentive to each individual dog’s needs and activity level. Ryder gets to play nonstop and has a ball!
I would highly recommend Vintage Kennel Club!❤️</Text>

<review>My dogs love going to Vintage which is important to me. It's hard to find a place I feel comfortable leaving my dogs,  but Vintage is that place for us! The owners and staff are always helpful and responsive. I can highly recommend them!<//review>< Pictures>

We fully trust Vintage Kennels to take good care of our dog. They have called us with concerns and even followed up with a vet visit. Jojo is quite happy there, as evidenced by his behavior at drop off. They are also on top of meds and required shots.< /text>

<Text>Our dog loves to go to Vintage and it is wonderful to know she is happy and safe while we travel.  All dogs are required to be up to date with their vaccinations.  We never worry about her.  If I do think about her I'm just thinking she is having a great time.  And based on the time of day I know she is happily playing or sleeping so she can play some more.  We have been taking our dogs there for just over 13 years.  The staff are fantastic and it is apparent when we drop them off they are always happy to be there.</Text><userid>107537232169751816047<//userid>< Gmap_id>

Always a positive experience for our dog and for us as her owners.  Mike and Brian infuse their business and relationships (with both the dogs and their owners) with care and respect and love.  They're the best!< /review>

Our dog, Yoshi, a shiba inu loves Vintage Kennel Club!  Everyone there is clearly a dog lover too.  We so appreciate that when we check in about how Yoshi is doing when we are away, we get a detailed report of her day.  We can enjoy ourselves knowing our dog is happy and well cared for.<//text>

We highly recommend Vintage Kennel Club!  Our two boxers LOVE going there. The facility is great and the staff exceptional. They know dog behavior and work hard to make sure each visit is a great one.
You just can't find a better place for your dog!

<text>Vintage Kennel Club , is amazing. I have had 2 Airedales ; Ollie and George. We have used Vintage to board the boys since 2005, an d Mike, Brian and Lori as well as the entire staff are so kind, knowledgeable,and professional.
Vintage Kennel Club is simply 5 stars plus some.
They take better care of your dogs better than i probably do.
All I can say , is they have been a God send for me since moving to the Bay area.

If anyone would need to leave their dog for an extended period of time because of travel, etc; I would highly recommend Vintage Kennel Club  as well.
I know my dogs LOVE  going there, then coming as well.
The best place for your Canine companion in the Bay area.</text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

I am very grateful to have such a wonderful place to send my dog for either day care or boarding.  He wants to leap out of the car when we pull up, he's so excited to be there.

Even more important, they are very conscientious and concerned with creating both a safe and fun environment for dogs.<//Text>

VKC is the best! Brian and Mike run a top notch operation. The staff is always welcoming , cheerful and helpful.
Never have any concerns when I leave my dog there. Professional but always feels like home from drop off to pickup.
Cannot recommend more highly- been coming here for years now! Never a problem or worry. 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼<//Review>

<Text>My dog has been going to Vintage Kennel Club since she was barely 6 months old.  She is over 11 yrs old now and I sometimes think she enjoys it there better than home!  She loves her playmates and the staff and I don't need to worry if she is safe and cared for while I am travelling.  She gives it 5 tail wags out of 5.< /Text>< Pics>

Tune my lovely dog daughter loves VKC.  The staff is wonderful, Michael and Brian - the founders - are the nicest and most knowledgeable folks that I've ever have a chance to interact with.  We live almost 2 hours away but we are more than happy to drive Tune to VKC as I don't trust any other kennel to look after her.  I love Vintage Kennel Club too as they are like my family who take good care of my Tune and allow for me to travel for work or for play :)< /Text>

Best place ever to take your dog! I have to say that my personal experience has been wonderful but my dog has the final say/bark. When he senses that we are remotely heading in the direction of Vintage Kennel Club he gets so excited. And then when he finds that we are actually going there, if he could, he'd open the door and let himself out--without even looking back to say "bye Mom." He plays all day and comes home a happy,  tired dog. Price is affordable and worth every penny for the care and love he gets from everyone there. I periodically have them trim his nails & the hair around his toes which is a breeze for them and I worry about cutting them too short. And the best days for me are when he's had a bath and is blown dry and all pretty when he comes home.< /Text>

Our sweet Kensy has been going to Vintage since she was a puppy (almost 10 years). There is no place she'd rather be on earth! It's dog heaven. As soon as we pull into the driveway she jumps up in her seat, tail wagging furiously. The folks at Vintage keep Kensy so engaged. During one visit, the pig next door gave birth - how fun is that?!  And they're awesome about making sure she takes her meds, caring for her occasional hot spots, and returning her to us healthy, happy, and brushed out. Vintage is not a kennel. It's a spa.< /review>

<Text>Vintage Kennel is so helpful, reliable, knowledgeable, organized, attentive and caring I feel confident leaving our 10 month old Lab for both play days and boarding. Plus, he loves it and comes home happy and worn out!< /Text><pics>None</pics><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x8085af036b590f99:0xf24c93fa3d846857</Gmap_id></record>

<name>Erica Lindeman</name><Date>1481742062404</Date><pics>None<//pics><Review>My dog is my pride and joy, and VKC takes such great care of him. He always comes home in great shape, and exhausted from playing! He LOVES visiting with them. As soon as we pull down the driveway, he is whining to get out of the car so he can play.  As a pup mom, that makes me feel so good! If you are on the fence about trusting VKC, give them a try. You will not be disappointed!< /Review><gmapID>0x8085af036b590f99:0xf24c93fa3d846857<//gmapID><UserId.>102038493605092915567<//UserId.>< rating>

<Review>Simply the BEST!  Having moved to Sonoma two years ago I needed a safe place for my dog to stay while I was out of town.  I had heard wonderful things about Vintage Kennel Club so I checked it out.  It is such a wonderful environment for my dog.  I lost him last year to cancer but then got another cocker spaniel a few months later.  He too boards here as well as  play dates each week to socialize him.  When it time to go home, he greets me, then turns around and wants to go back.  I can't recommend Vintage enough for terrific care of your fur baby.<//Review><response>None</response></record></dataset><record>

I told the kids that everyone had a choice. I said "I don't want a worm or anything swimming up my butt. So, I choose to wear a bathing suit." They decided to wear theirs too.
Yes, there were naked adults in the water. Many people put the slimy mud on their skin, I did not. The water is very hot. The pond is about 4 feet deep in the middle. The water in the stream is cooler than in the pond.  This spring is free. Park on the side of the road.
No changing rooms.
No bathrooms.
No security.
No privacy.
No camping in this spot.

Bring your own chair.

<text>I have been going here for 30 plus years ...the health benefits for mind and body are awesome...there are outside springs which for some are clothing optional..and then there is the public place that is $9.00 I use this option the most....it's men on a new side women on the other....there are showers there also and the water is clean..unlike the outdoor option...then there is a place called Delights which in my opinion is over priced now they consider themselves a "SPA" the best thing with this option is privacy. So couples can go in together and lock the door....I believe now during weekdays it's $20.00 up till 5 p.m. and weekends it's either $25 or $30 each...have fun and also explorethe China date ranch< /text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

<Date>1543461288217< /Date><rating>4</rating><Text>Unique primitive hot spring, mud bath.  water is hot about 104 degrees plus at the largest part of this marshy hot spring.  Really easy to get too, park along the road. Can be quite busy. Went on a Sunday night and there were quite a few different groups. Hot spring is large enough to have privacy with varying levels of heat. No place to sit once in the water unless is the shallower part.  Mud floor is nice to walk though but be careful of the hot spots! Overall wonderful, no odor silky soft water. Accessible 24/7, dog friendly.  Clothing optional!  Great night time soaking under the moonlight.

Free camping 1/4 mile down on furnace creek where the cement tub is, which was another adventure...
Concrete tub located on blm land off furnace creek we stumbled upon accidentally when trying to pick a nice camping spot next to trees at night.   Tub itself is nice if you’re alone, but not likely as there are “locals” who seem to lurk around all day and tell stories while others are trying to get some peace and quiet.  Water inside tub is warm not really rising at all so at night you might start to get cold. Area was nice and drivable dirt road.  Highly recommend if you don’t mind a little local flavor.<//Text>< Pictures>

Take some flip flops for sure.  This is a real hot springs busy with young people.  Probably not the best place for young children since some places in the springs are extremely hot.<//review>

Went in April, hoping it would be nice after a fairly wet winter but it was mostly mud, insects, and algae.< /Text>

Primative pools.... Large and relatively shallow.   The furthest end is the hottest part.  The closer pool is perfect temp for me... About 102 ave.  Mud bottom.  Nude or suited.   There are hot spring mites that will bite on you for a couple hours after,your soak but they dont leave marks.   You can see them dancing on top the water if you have good eyes.   Nice place just because there is really nothing else for free.  It get busy.   It is dangerously slippy in the mud outside the pools.   Bring a blanket and tarp to lay out between soaks.  Bring water to drink.< /Text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) I was there a couple of years ago. The place is very special, practically one is in the middle of nowhere. You can find pools of hot water in the desert and campers. It's an unusual but nice place to spend a night in a tent or camper while admiring the stars, drinking a cold beer and maybe relaxing in a puddle. I recommend :)

Ci sono stato un paio di anni fa. Il luogo è molto particolare, praticamente si è nel bel mezzo di nulla. Si possono trovare pozze di acqua calda nel deserto e campeggiatori. È un posto insolito ma carino per trascorrerete una notte in tenda o camper ammirando le stelle, bevendo una birra fresca e magari rilassati in una pozza.

<Text>(Translated by Google) Natural hot springs. The atmosphere of TekoPa Hot Springs in the evening can clearly see the area and the surrounding views. Although hot but quiet Flies and mosquitoes Daytime, some time, and some bite when immersed in a hot spring. Will scavenge the insects in themselves.

Natural hot springs. บรรยากาศของบ่อน้ำพุร้อน เทโคป้า ในยามเย็น ที่สามารถมองเห็นสภาพพื้นที่และวิวรอบข้างได้อย่างชัดเจน แม้จะร้อนแต่ก็เงียบสงบ มีแมลงวันและยุง กลางวันมาตอมบ้าง และบ้างก็กัด เมื่อลงแช่น้ำพุร้อน ก็จะไล่ฝูงแมลงไปในตัว.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

(Translated by Google) Very high-quality wild hot springs and white sand dunes landscape, vehicles cannot enter places other than highways, and locals have a strong sense of environmental protection

Lovely spot with great food cooked with authenticity,  love and attention. The interior is very architecturally clean with a lot of straight lines and edges. We had a little bit of everything on the menu and it was all delicious, well seasoned and appropriately portioned. The watermelon gazpacho with the fresh oysters was a  huge standout amongst the starters. For entree, I had the pasta of the day and it was soooooooooooo tasty, spaghetti with spicy chicken sausage and broccolini tossed in an oil based sauce. We also had the vegetarian paella which was lovely. Heaven!< /text>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>We had read a bit about the restaurant before we decided to try it, hearing mostly about the wine available but not about the food. After receiving some great recommendations from the waitress, each dish proved better than the last. The Moroccan spiced carrots, polenta, and salted branzino were all incredible, and the recommended wine pairing was the perfect match. Our favorite dish though, was probably the Grilled Spring Onions, Feta, Pistachio Butter, Prunes, Lemon. I definitely recommend trying that one, I don't think you will be disappointed!< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

Being kinda done with Chaya across the street, my wife and I popped in to Chez Tex and thought it was outstanding.  We love French food, and this certainly did not disappoint.  We look forward to returning.<//Review>

Good dessert, but the wait was super long, well for everyone behind us. By the luck of the draw and good timing we got a seat quickly. Seems to have a good mix of a variety of desserts and the sugar hit the spot just right. The chocolate lava dessert was definitely great blend of different flavors. Will most likely be back and hope for the same luck as the first visit there. The wait is crazy especially if your in a group.</Review>

They ran out of ice so we couldn't get any cold drinks. The deserts were good. The basil chicken with rice was too salty for us. Would definitely return<//review>

Yummy late night treats. Majority of menu selection is dessert however some are meal worthy.

Only 6 tables available which tend to be occupied already. Doesn't bring my rating down though because you can always have take out/to-go.

They close either at midnight or 1am for you night owls!

I appreciated the swift and courteous customer service.<//Review>

i love their desserts! i just wish it wasn’t so expensive 😔 i did come across one worker that was kind of rude but i feel like maybe it was a misunderstanding because of the language barrier. other than that, great place worth trying 🙂</review>

<review>Delicious! Highly recommend the salted egg custard, it was the best of everything I tried. Pictured are the shibaya honey toast with thai tea ice cream and the melon snow (the green orbs are carved honeydew pieces!).

<review>Thai influenced desserts (I believe). I go nuts for anything Thai tea and mango. Durian stuff is always intriguing.

Love their Mango shaved ice (comes with a little side of sticky rice). The roti with Thai tea ice cream is good but feels a bit oily. The honey toast is so good with the condensed milk.

They open late. Service is excellent.< /review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM_An0EXbtanH3BWxQB351B1xwNM_aTN6IuweVP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN3y7CKYSmhPvzEITjt9ekhlKBtApIf3TXl-xNU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMPsAto-pzjB93OWWsCYg1adel4o2B7H35H2Ax5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM-Qi4UWWbvdIT9_TFHlbGC3rWLNIcFdtODAj2B=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< resp>

New favorite desert cafe in the city! Super cute place, friendly waiters, tasty, unique, creative, fun food, and a great atmosphere. The Volcano was basically a pile of ice cream shredded like cheese with some toppings? Super fun and super tasty!</Review>

Came in at 10 pm on a Sunday night. Loved that there was a late night dessert spot. Ordered the melon snow and was really surprised that it was shaved vanilla ice cream instead of just shaved ice. Very different and very good.</review>

The dessert we ordered did not have fresh mango like the menu stated. It was quite misleading. When we got our dessert, the mango was frozen so the dessert was hard to enjoy. In addition, our party was charged an 18%  gratuity. We had no problem paying the tip however, the rules were quite unclear. The service was not great. The hot water also took super long to get to us. We were almost done with our dessert by the time the rest of our party got our drinks. The environment is nice, but the menu should be a little more clear.<//text>

I really like this place in terms of quality, portion sizes, and price! I love checking out new asian dessert sit down shops because there aren't many that I like and I am always in a hunt for more. I have heard so many good things about this place. I was so happy to finally come here with two friends.

We all ordered three items to share!

*Thai Tea Roti - The roti takes a while to make but it was worth the wait! The roti was crispy and a lot of glaze topped with it. The thai tea icecream was just perfect with it.

*Mango sticky rice crepe - This was our favorite! This came out fairly quickly too! The skin is so thin and soft. The sticky rice is in the middle or the crepe. It is a little heavy on the whip cream but it's dessert so that's ok!

*Steamed bread with pandan dip - Wasn't impressed with this one. The bread it just a slice of bread cut into piece which I feel like it was something that is easy to make at home. The picture made it look more complicated.

Overall, I really like this place! I would totally come back here. I came on a weeknight so it wasn't too busy but I can imagine this place packed during the weekend.</text>

It was great! We had the shaved ice with oreos, coco powder, cereal and cake. We added condense milk and it was perfectly sweetened. One size is sufficient for 2 people!</Text>

< review>
I don't spend much time in the Inner Richmond, so I wanted to take advantage of the visit out there and go to this Na Ya location for the first time. This location is quaint and decorated in what some may call shabby chic; something I noticed right off the bat (and which may border on unsafe) is that the floor was wet and I felt my shoes sliding on it.

It wasn't busy when I arrived so my bf and I were able to be seated right away and were given menus. We ordered the mille crepe cake to share since I hadn't been able to try it before (the Hayes Valley location is alwaysss out). When it arrived, it was somewhat smaller than expected, but the way it was presented was cute. Flavour-wise, it was all right; I expected a stronger flavour after having tried mille crepe cakes at similar establishments. This one mostly just tasted like cream.

As many of the other reviewers mentioned, it's cash only - not a deal-breaker, but just something to be aware of when visiting this business. Overall, the experience was fine but I'll probably check out some other nearby businesses the next time I'm around here.</review>

FRAUDULENT 18% gratuity charge on our bill

I went to this dessert place yesterday night with three of my friends at 11:30pm.(On January 7, 2020) It was very hard to communicate with the waitress because she knew very little english, but that is not the reason that I give them one star. The waitress added the 18% gratuity on our bill, but we only have 4 people. When I asked her why there is 18% gratuity on our bill, she said the reason is she gave us a big table. Then, I said we only have 4 people though. After that, she changed the reason. She said it's a computer problem and asked us to just ignore the 18% gratuity. However, my friend asked her to give us a new bill. We only gave her 10% of the tip because we think what she was dishonest. Also, when we asked her for straws, she told us they don't have straws. She didn't check on us the whole time even though we sat next to the cashier. Actually, I don't really care the service. I always give at least 15% tip even though the service is just ok. What make us feel bad is that she added the 18% gratuity her own and the reason that she gave us isn't make any sense. If she checks on us and give us a good service, I won't mind if she charges us the service fee. How can you charge for the service fee when you didn't do your job? And also you don't have the right to charge because we only have 4 people. I know computer, and I know she added the 18% gratuity her own because I am a manager and work at restaurant.<//Text>

When I got the bill, it shows "open food$3". I asked the waitress what is the "open food", and she said "oh, it's the sauces." "We charge $1.50 for each, so it's 3 dollar." They should tell the customers in the first place! Btw, the price on yelp isn't right. The price on yelp is cheaper than the price on the menu< /Text>< pics>

<Time>1583789627922</Time><Rate>2<//Rate><review>I don't spend much time in the Inner Richmond, so I wanted to take advantage of the visit out there and go to this Na Ya location for the first time. This location is quaint and decorated in what some may call shabby chic; something I noticed right off the bat (and which may border on unsafe) is that the floor was wet and I felt my shoes sliding on it.

It wasn't busy when I arrived so my bf and I were able to be seated right away and were given menus. We ordered the mille crepe cake to share since I hadn't been able to try it before (the Hayes Valley location is alwaysss out). When it arrived, it was somewhat smaller than expected, but the way it was presented was cute. Flavour-wise, it was all right; I expected a stronger flavour after having tried mille crepe cakes at similar establishments. This one mostly just tasted like cream.

As many of the other reviewers mentioned, it's cash only - not a deal-breaker, but just something to be aware of when visiting this business. Overall, the experience was fine but I'll probably check out some other nearby businesses the next time I'm around here.</review>< pics>

Great tasting food and desert! Amazing place to hang out and chill with friends but they did forget part of my order :(. Hopefully I just got unlucky and that it doesn't happen too much. Takes a while for food but it's worth the wait! Large portions and friendly staff<//text>

Where to start?? Watching the staff create the delectable desserts was almost as good as eating them.
The interior is small with only 4-5 tables, which is perfect for being open late. When you walk in, you're greeted by the scent of waffles and photos of the desserts. Good luck picking only one!!<//Review>

Let me start off saying that I am very disappointed that I can not give Na Ya a better review as my impression from the reviews online was incredible.

Upon entering, I found there to be a nicely decorated store.  I was immediately greeted a server who brought us water after presenting menus.

After ordering, we waited quite a bit for our crepes to be made.  I observed the preparer place whip cream on my crepe.  She got stopped by the server who noted that it had been ordered without whip cream.  They then proceeded in using napkins to wipe away some of the whip cream that was placed on my crepe.  To cover up the mistake, I observed the preparer add more filling.

When the beautifully presented crepe was delivered to me, I asked the server if there was any whip cream placed on it as I am highly sensitive to it.  She said no.  I then said that I saw the preparer place whip cream on it and that I had seen her to stop.  She continued to insist that none had been placed on it.

I carefully ate the crepe which was quite delicious and avoided areas that seemed to have some signs of whip cream.

When the check arrived, my guest observed that one of the crepes was a higher charge even though they were similar and should have been the same price.  I brought this up to the server who consulted one of the owner's.  She said that she would correct the error.  A correct check was delivered with no apology but only an excuse that there was something wrong with the register.

Overall, the desserts purchased were delicious, however the long wait for the food and poor customer service deem this as a place that I would never return to.<//review>

<Review>I had never heard of Thai desserts before coming to this place and was really pleased. They have a lot of items that use Ovaltine (malt), green tea (sweetened flavor) and the bright orange Thai tea flavors on top of waffles, crepes and ice cream. In addition to having Thai desserts they also have some shaved ice items and Korean patbingsu and cooked food (pork shoulder and Thai omelets). I plan on coming back here again.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<review>Right next door to Sharetea -- my favorite bubble tea place ever. I was happy I wasn't griefed to death for bringing in an outside drink, but perhaps I was just very discreet. I know it's not exactly courteous, but in MY AMERIKA I should be able to have my favorite bubble tea and eat some desserts at the same time.

We tried the Jumbo Thai Crepe and the Na Ya Toast with Chili Paste and Shredded Pork. The pork and turkey sausage in the crepe was a bit weird, but then again it is a pork and turkey sausage. The menu is extensive. As long as they don't mind me enjoying some outside bubble tea, I'll happily come back to try more of their stuff!<//review><pics>None< /pics><GmapID>0x80858710e2088787:0x9db3483b8d2634e2<//GmapID><username>Mark Cerqueira</username></record>

Tried green tea, chocolate, gamma honey toast
Really every one is my heart is good, are very delicious!
Mainly toast is very good, the outer layer is crisp and the inside is soft.
I ordered mango glutinous rice ice today!
My wife likes this glutinous rice and it tastes very good! If I can only match the glutinous rice with a single point, I should eat it every day.
But the mango is really not sweet, and the mango is sour! Hope to improve!
Then there was no knife to cut the mango for us, and the waiter had to send the knife for a delay... Instead, I sent the bill first! I didn’t give the knife to me until the checkout. The service needs to be improved.
There is only cash and no cards here!

來訪了許多次
試過綠茶、巧克力、伽耶蜜糖吐司
真的每款都是我的心頭好，都很好吃！
主要是吐司烤的很出色、外層酥脆、內裡軟
今天點了芒果糯米冰！
我太太喜歡這個糯米了，口感非常好！如果能只單點搭配的糯米飯，我應該會每天來吃😋
但那個芒果就真的不甜、芒果吃起來酸澀！希望改進！
然後沒有刀子給我們切下那個芒果、跟服務員要刀子遲遲沒送來...反而先送來帳單！直到結帳也沒把刀子給我😑😑服務有待進步
還有這裡只收現金不收卡唷！<//review>< pictures>

Doughnuts always taste great. But the best part of this shop is Octavio! He’s a phenomenal employee! I can always sense his kindness behind the mask. Give him a raise because coming here always gives me faith again in humanity 🌞🙌</text>

IDC what anyone says, nobody's donuts beat Yum Yum Donuts. Always fresh, always tasty and always ready for you to pick yourself up a dozen (or two). They're perfect for home, for work or for wherever whenever!<//text>

< Review>
Best donuts that i have had in the last couple of years!  I asked for a dozen, and they gave me a bakers dozen (15)!  I was in San Diego for 4 days and we got donuts twice.  They aren't your crispy cremes.  These have some heft to them.<//Review>

<review>I love this place. By far my favorite go to DONUTS. I wake up at 0245 just get them the donuts fresh and warm. Donuts holes are to die for. It's so warm and soft.  It literally melts in your mouth. Staff there is super friendly and nice. #1 donuts in town by far my favorite.  I was born and raised her in SD so Yaaaaas!</review>< Pictures>

I’ve alway gone to this location because it convenient for me and it’s open for 24 hours. Good service prices are average but they are alway fresh! If you have a big order you can call the day prior and schedule a pick up time which they have always had ready!</Text>

DoD  (Day Old Doughnuts) can't beat them . I don't have much money..., so whenever I can save a little, I do .... so let me start with a short story about this little shop, and the great manager that this shop has. I'm up most nights pretty late , sometimes all night. Late one night , or was it early morning, I was out for some fresh air; I was cold , hungry, and about to fall asleep. So this place is open 24/7 . I had maybe 2,or3 $  . So I order a coffee and I ask if they have any day old doughnuts, you know the ones they are about to throw out ; like they do every day. Well he hooked me up with a small bag ( of doughnuts)to add to my large coffee. Wide awake from the coffee, full belly from the doughnuts I was ready to start my day or continue it anyway. So I always tip them when I can, and sometimes I don't get there early enough for the day old d's , but I am definitely a fan. 5stars and then some.<//review>

The perfect place to go in the mornings!! Donuts are always fresh when I get them, and there are other delicious choices to get besides donuts. Plus, the place has good spacing.< /Review>

The food was delicious,  the prices we great, and the service was very accommodating.

Donuts brought us here, but the burritos and sandwiches were excellent as well.

Come hungry big portions!!</Text>

Doughnuts seemed fresh but unfortunately didn't have any of the ones i was craving in-particular (nothing fancy) otherwise i would give this location 5 stars ... Most other yum yums are not very good anymore but this location is on point and always fresh</Review>

Great place to have a cold beer and catch with good friends. Awesome chavelas and MiCheladas with beer of your choice and if you get hungry they have a nice menu from seafood to traditional mexican plates.< /Review>

My Mom & I came to have dinner here after attending a religious retreat. We will definitely come back next time we’re in town cause this place is FIRE! 😋I have no pics to share since I devoured my shrimp by the time I remembered lol...DELISH...and the service was awesome.

Awesome Mexican seafood restaurant. Has all the other regular Mexican dishes as well. Recommend the pastor & asada tacos, fried telapia and chevelas. Shrimp cocktails are good not great. Taqueria style diner. Awesome seafood appetizers.< /text>

I liked it. The food was good and it was quiet and the yet a You enjoy whatever TV shows you want to watch while you eat. It wasn't crowded when I went so I can't at if the food was fast or slow. But it was good. Plenty of vegetables. Good cold beer. Reasonably priced also.</review>

I ordered the 7 mares it was cold and greasy had no flavor  like a spicy sea soup should be like it's the broth that makes olit all come together .it should be taken off the menu plus our food ce separate so we had to wait to eat together as the plates where late .like they say you have to try it first right .well I did won't be going back there again<//Text>

This place is the best Mexican food in town hands down. This is NOT a regular full service restaurant, however. You walk in, order at the register and go find a seat with a number. The wonderful, hardworking FAMILY that owns the place, brings you your food. If you need anything else later you just simply walk up to counter and ask for it. People that complain this place has bad service are simply wrong. The people that work here are very kind and accommodating, but they are not just lurking around your table to refill your soda after every freaking sip. If you need something, get up off your ass and use your mouth and ask! This place is bomb. Food great. Service great. Stop being so damn entitled, Modesto. Appreciate a good local business!</text>

As we were paying itcame to $69 and my husband ask if we were going to be charge and she said yes I was half way aten . My mother in law said to her were never going to come back she just looked at us and said that fine . This is ridiculous. I would not recommend anyone to come here .<//review><user_id>104442781549965241753< /user_id><Date>1556172032000</Date><pictures>None< /pictures>< GmapID>

I've been coming here over 10 years. A decent, affordable, quiet place to eat. They have even updated a few tv screens with news and food shows. Dine in or take out.<//Review>

Waited almost an hour for our food. The waitress had the nerve to tell us that customers that order at the counter have priority  over people sitting down. What a bunch of bulls**t. Food wasn't as good as i expected it to be. Drinks are good. I won't be going back to this location.< /Review>

I must say the michaladas  were grt.,the shrimp way over cooked.some of the staff did not know wat they were doing,it was confusing all around.Portion are good size.i had shrimp veracruz.There were few items missing  from the dish.i wud go back for the beer michelada  for shure.The tacos we had on our tabel looked good.I try that next time.Even though the meat will be cooked way past it shud be.< /Text>

Food is delicious, the Chavelas were delicious and the staff is friendly!  The only downside was the place was a little hot when coming from a 100° weather outside you'd hope you'd be able to enjoy your food in a cool place!  Other the that really recommend this place.  My favorite is the #1 Costa Azul plate!< /Text>

Pretty decent Mexican place. Been here twice and portions seem really good for the price! Only gotten burritos but it came with sour cream and guac and tasted pretty good!

Definitely will be coming back here.</text>

<Review>I was really upset that for a half filled take out container of beans and cheese quoted @ $4  and led to believe they would fill the  container she showed me and then shown the smaller container and quoted 2$ so I asked for half of that size for the pico de gallo ..lol I had yet been schooled in weights and measures full of smiles and lies El Marisquero style..I paid 6$ for a plate of beans and 2 small little plastic  salsa bar containers that they give for.free they charged me . When i.paid I specifically asked to see the sizes and told her it was my birthday and I had only a few dollars but I still wanted me and my daughter to make it special to add it to the rainbow trout my son gave me to make for dinner.. she smiled while she lied. Took the last of money and delivered to me half of what I was promised and when I tried to say something she was very rude and dismissive and said what seemed had to be nothing nice in Spanish..otherwise why not address my concerns. I notice but have NEVER publicly announced if I don't have my Mexican husband or my mexican children/or my Dominican eldest daughter .  My white face sure gets treated a lot like a "Mark"  as they smile to distract u from the hand in your pocket..and on my birthday? I'm sorry but those 2 horrible girls should be fired and I shouldn't have to bring my darker loved ones to get treated with respect just as no one should..what horrible lil incompetent prejudice tramps you have representing your restaurant..oh and forgot to even mention that they made me wait literally 15 MINUTES even tho the 1 table was already done and the other were a 2 top table dining In and I had to wait 15 minutes for beans and cheese and salsa for salsa bar..thanks for adding your special touch to my  birthday<//Review>< userid>

Good place and food plus cheap beer they serve 32oz beer mugs for $5 ranging from budlight to dust bowl beer. Food is good and a good price definitely a place to check out.<//Text>

This last time the guy who took my order, up and left the register in the middle of the order so that someone else had to take over it. Forgot a meal and just charged us without really going over the order. What is so difficult about communication and plain and simply taking an order?

My tostadas de ceviche were bland. I thought they'd be really tasty but it was just bland all around. Highlight of that plate was the avocado. Only reason I'm giving it 2 stars instead of one is because my sisters burrito de carne asada was actually pretty darn good.< /text>

Bad service, and they charge 3% of the amount if you want to pay with a card, I'm my opinion the owner should pay for the card machine service, in this case they are taking advantage of customers.<//review>

<review>(Translated by Google) Sometimes the fish is fresh. Others don't. Shrimp are very few per plate and the price does not match. Good attention and good variety.
A blonde at the checkout has bad service, I think she doesn't like people. He pouts.
