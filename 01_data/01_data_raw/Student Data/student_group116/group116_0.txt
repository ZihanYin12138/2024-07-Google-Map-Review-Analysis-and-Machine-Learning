<Review>Worst customer service ever. They cancelled our flights and said that they will reimburse our tickets (around $5000) but they never did nor responded to our emails and calls. I hate to say it, but it's clear now that they are a bunch of thieves and scammers with no integrity at all - shame on them< /Review>< pictures>

<Text>The worst customer service in the world.  I bought three tickets last year for round trip SFO to IST and the flights were cancelled because of the pandemic.  They issued me vouchers but since last year I called dozens times but no one can help me to issue tickets using my vouchers. It takes more than half hour to answer your call and they refer you to another person or tell you to buy it in their office which doesn't exist.  They don't give you their office address. Last year one of their customer service gave me an address and I drove all the way to San Francisco and found out that the address was a parking lot.  I love Turkey but Turkish Airlines has THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE IN THE WORLD!<//Text>< pics>

Bunch of thieves! I travelled before Pandemic and had to retun in Pandemic but due to Travel Bans no flight were available to Canada, though flight within Canada were on. They just ate my ticket saying I had missed my flight from Montreal to Vancouver while They didnt have a flight to bring me to Canada in the first place. They played the game of go to travel agent and back and forth. After 2 months, they said your ticket was ‘No Show’ in Montreal ignoring the fact they failed to offer a flight to get me to Montreal, so I could catch the flight from there. Do not recommend flying with them.< /text>

The worst airline I have ever seen. My mum was traveling through it and had hard time getting in the transit flight, no wheelchair helper was waiting for her which made her miss the next flight. Uncomfortable plane, bad food. I don't advise any body to use Turkish airlines.< /text>

It’s really bad customer service they made me to change my travel date and pay extras fee because they don’t have any space at this date to take my small dog with me and I changed but after I change my travel date I call them 2 days after they told me you don’t have any dog travel request if you want to take your dog with you, you need to change your travel date again and pay extra fee because also they don’t have any space to my dog again.< /Review>

<review>Here's a funny story.
So back in February 2019 I have changed my mothers return ticket to move it from March 2019 to July 2019. I payed a fee for the change of the ticket with the exact same credit card I used to purchase the original ticket.
And guess what my mother comes to the airport and tries to check in but she is denied because the airline is asking to show the credit card that was used to make the change to the ticket in order to validate there is no scam! Really?
Of course my mother didn't have my credit card at the check-in in Kiev, nor did I have it being in the US at the moment, because the card was closed about a month ago by the bank and I was issued a new card.

What did the Turkish airlines customer support did when I called them? Nothing! They told you have to drive to the nearest office and show the card. Oh wow, the nearest office is 100 miles away and my mother's plane is in 2 hours. Is there any other resolution? No!

What kind of a process is that?
Why this wasn't mentioned explicitly in the email confirmation I got for the ticket from Turkish Airlines?
What am I supposed to do in the case if I don’t have the credit card anymore?
What is the point of validating the credit card on the return ticket only if the payment for the original ticket was made with the same credit card?
If Turkish Airlines suspects scam why didn’t they block the transaction immediately and have a normal online validation process?
How am I supposed to validate the credit card if I'm not purchasing the ticket for myself and the closest Turkish airlines office is 100 miles away? What about the people that don't have a Turkish airlines office in the radius of 1000 miles from their house?

Horribly organized process with credit card validation, poor support personal and and awful customer service experience.

Thank you Turkish Airlines for the interesting experience!

P.S. I don't know what my mother did, but she was eventually able to board the plane after a 2 hour discussion at check in.</review><user_name>Nikita Y< /user_name>< UserId.>

Never Turkish airline again.
Its hard to believe, that this airline is a star alliance member. We waited for boarding to our flight from Istanbul to Rome, while two other flights were boarding at the same time right next to each other. Thus, 300 people stood all in front of the gates and it was not possible to figure out, which crowd belonged to which gate. Suddenly the sign for our flight was deleted and the people right next to the gate mentioned, that our gate is closed... no chance to get in, nothing! No last call or any call at all from the gate. The people from our gate were literally disappeared. Although the plane was still at docking station, we couldn’t get in. But we figured out, that this is their way to make a ton of extra money, by charging fees for changing the tickets. We saw a bunch of people at the Turkish Airline help desk after, who had the same problem. Unbelievable and totally unprofessional. We explained them, that we were at the boarding gate an hour before and waited in this big crowd for the other 2 plane flights, but no one believed us and said its our fault. We have to pay a penalty now. Same sentence got the customer standing next to us. In addition, while we finally waited for our overpaid flight, a lady booked business class for her and her two kids and was harassed, because she was black. The desk guy observed her passport several times, lifted it in the air to check for authenticity and critically looked at her. After she had to wait another couple of minutes, they led her board finally and she called him out, that this was totally inappropriate. The guy just turned around and smiled. No apologies, nothing! We were so shocked about this racist behavior. They did not even take a look at all the other passports, where the majority was white. Finally, the lady at the ticket desk did not even bother to put us together, after we realized, that the flight was half empty! We never fly with Turkish airline again, thats for sure. Its worth to pay a little extra, but at least you will be treated with respect and like a human.< /review>

<Review>Bought 4 tickets for my parents and got enough of troubles to switch to other company. I had issues with checking in my parents, people in the airport are not available at 3-4 PM, though supposed to stay there from 2 to 5 PM. After 5 PM you'll get NO HELP from anyone in Turkish airlines, online support is rude and useless. Will definitely switch to German airlines. Their convenient schedule is completely overlapped by ABOVE ZERO SERVICE.< /Review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x808f7784da338d0b:0x8c931c64df373c31< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>I recently tried to make a change to a flight booking that I had made previously, for which Turkish Airlines had already charged my credit card in full 2 months ago. I was told I could not change my ticket without going to the nearest Turkish Airlines office and presenting my credit card in person. The nearest Turkish Airlines office is 45 miles away at SFO. Just Imagine if I lived 300 miles away from SFO or a Turkish Airlines office? How can a company take your money and then insist upon such a ridiculous requirement to make a simple reservation change?<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<text>I recently took Turkish Airlines for the first time to India (with a layover in Istanbul) and I was completely satisfied with price of the ticket and the level of service I received. There's nothing that can done to rush a long flight plan but the flight attendants did a great job in making the travel as comfortable as possible. They had a great selection of movies and the meals were very hearty so there was no worry of going hungry on the flight. I would definitely fly with them again.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

< Review>
PET OWNERS steer clear!  Called customer service about flying with my small dog was told my particular flight would be fine -  just book, call back, and make the reservation for my dog in cabin.  Booked it, called back, and wouldn't you know?  I could not bring my dog in cabin!  Unbelievably, they would only refund 30euros of a 900euro flight and gave me instructions on how to submit feedback then instructed to call back so agents could mark it urgent to get refunded faster.  Submitted feedback called back once again and they would not mark it urgent.  The WORST customer service and it might have cost me 900 euros.<//Review>

<review>I wish, I can give them -ve stars, They don't deserve even 1 Star. One of the worst airlines to fly with. Zero customer Service, No Courtesy, No English, No support when flight cancels, No Wheel Chair Support, Baggage was Damaged. I can't even count problems with this Airline, I really don't know how they are flying at international level. They should be banned and go out of business. It's my mistake I chose this airline to fly. Worst experience of my 20 years of flying history. I won't recommend anyone to fly with this airlines as I will never ever fly with them.</review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

<Review>I love Turkish Airlines and make sure I fly it every time I have the chance. The incredible food, the attentive customer service, the extensive library of content and high quality entertainment system (which is a standard on every long distance international flght) just make them my go to airlines. Over the past 2 years I have been to over 20 countries and over a 80 cities for work and leisure, even if it extends my flight by 1 or 2 hours, I still take Turkish Airlines.<//Review><Resp>None<//Resp><pictures>None<//pictures>< username>

< Review>
First time and last time flying with them.  What it says on the ticket, is completely different from what is said when checking in at the airport (San Francisco Airport). Even when showing it to them on the ticket, the blaintently lie to your face and say that's not what it says .
I'm my case, the ticket said one Cary on and one personal item.  I had my laptop backpack (smaller than normal backpack) and a standard carry-on bag.  Refused to allow me to take both on flight even after I showed them their own ticket/contract. Kept on saying what it says on the ticket is not true.  Had me repack everything at the airport so I can fit my backpack in the carry on.<//Review>

<Rate>1</Rate><review>I was amazed at how unprepared the staff of this major carrier at one of the busiest airports (SFO) were to handle Customers after their flight got cancelled. There was very little flow of information, and nobody out of the 300 or so knew what their fate was. It was complete chaos. We were asked to contact customer service through calls (which was perennially busy) or drop them a mail (which bounced back because their mail box was full). Even after getting in touch with the customer service, we were asked to confirm at the ticketing counter. I felt sorry for the customer reps at the counter though. They were heavily outnumbered.
I can only imagine how miserable the situation for older populace would've been.
If you want reliable backup support or have parents traveling by themselves, I strongly discourage choosing Turkish Airlines.</review>< Pictures>

worst customer service of all time!!! I bought my tickets with Turkish airlines to San Francisco.Turns out I need to change the airport in Istanbul and I need to transfer my luggage myself from IST to the SAW airport!!! I called the costumer service and all they could say was that you bought the tickets it's your responsibility to transfer your luggage as well as to figure out how to get from one airport to another!!! The least thing that they could do was to provide information about the transfer, specially when both my flights are from Turkish Airline. Extremely disappointed with the customer service!!!<//review>

Not to be a privileged American yelling about the quality of service, but my stars this is embarrassing. I tried to book an international flight and I found the best prices through Turkish airlines on a third party website. I got through the whole process surviving the ilogical UI and when I get to payment, of course my card will not let me process; mind you it's 11:30PM. I call the number provided and my bank let's me know that there is nothing wrong from their end, they don't even see attempts of said tranaction. I call Turkish Airlines and I get on the phone with a mean lady prompting me to redo the entire process for an extra $40 because she has to do it for me. LOL fine. It takes about 15 minutes and it still will not go through. I'm told there is a reservation, but prices may change and call back. LOL fine. I call back at 8AM and same thing. I'm told to go to 'office', which is a POBox!!!!!!!????? The other option is to go to Airport to complete payment, which is an hour away. I tried calling, but they're only open for about 3 hours each day. Also, the reservation will expire at 9 AM tomorrow if I don't pay, but there is no way to pay and no where to pay. What's happening??!!!! Please, please do better.</text>

Horrible experience when requesting a refund . They tossed my case around amongst themselves for several days. I spoke to Customer relation Natalie who was barely of any help. She told me there is nothing she can do. I need to go to SFO office which means 4 hours of my time. How ridiculous . They seemed very unhelpful. Horrible, I would give 0 star if there is an option<//text>

< Review>
DO NOT USE Turkish Airlines the worst company I ever flown with. I had to stay in Istambul 16 hours because the mistakes that the company employees made and  when I wanted to talk with somebody from customer service they were very rude turned their back  and ignored me.
I was traveling from San Francisco to Budapest with Romanian papers and they didn't allow me to bord the plane in Istambul to Budapest because I didn't have a visa. Romania is part of EU we do not need visas to travel any were in Europe. But this guys didn't get it, so I had to buy a different plane ticket to Romania and of course because of that all my return tickets to San Francisco were cancelled and I had to pay another $1400 for a new ticket.
And what is the company answer to all of this? "Carrier shall not be liable for any aid or information given by any agent or employee of carrier to any passenger "
My first and last time flying with this company.
"Thanks" for all the headaches and stress you've given me!<//Review>

<Text>Turkish employee demanded large amount of cash in order to check my excess bagage.  Wouldn't take credit card.  Turkish airlines customer service rep on phone even said it sounded like he was scamming me but didn't seem too bothered.  Be very wary, this is not what you'd call a first class airline.</Text><gmapID>0x808f7784da338d0b:0x8c931c64df373c31< /gmapID><UserId.>117340351569649761087<//UserId.>< date>

they have so many quality products that can meet your growing needs. i went in and they helped me choose a soil, and some very quality pest control (all organic). They are super informative as well. I've decided that they will be THE place to go to for all my gardening/growing needs. Great prices too..cheaper than what i've seen it retail for.</Text>

<Text>Amazing spot for hydroponics information and materials. Guys are EXTREMELY knowledgeable in everything. Scott that runs the place literally can point you in the right direction and give you fact for fact of what you're trying to accomplish. Taylor is right up there with Scott. Great warehouse. If they don't have something or don't stock it. They can get it to your front door within days. Best place to go. Thanks guys!<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

<Review>I really like this store. Being new to gardening and having more questions than money didn't deter Taylor or Tony from patiently answering all of my questions. I appreciate that.
They have a well stocked and organized store with very good (see low) pricing.
General Organics Go Box....It was on sale for less than the lowest price I could find on Amazon!
My nephew, Steven, told me that Fox Farms Ocean Forest Potting Soil is the best.The store has 1.5 cu ft bag of FF OF for $10.. Until now, I've been paying for a smaller, yet more expensive bag from the store I used to go to ;).
They're very easy to get to, right off the 5 freeway. Handicapped Parking  and access, very savvy and helpful staff. Spectrum has both Indoor and Outdoor gardening supplies and equipment. 5 Stars< /Review>< username>

<rate>5</rate><Review>I highly recommend Spectrum Hydro!  I was recommended by a friend who told me they were knowledgeable, friendly, well stocked and would price match. I was more than pleased with the help I received from Taylor, and there was no need to price match because their prices are the best around!  Definitely worth the 1.5 hour drive for me. I enjoy spreading the word when you can help others and the business. Thank you, Spectrum Hydro!< /Review>< pictures>

Very knowledgeable crew at spectrum hydro, there service is great, the deals were good and I will be back for sure. If your thinking of stopping by definitely give em chance I’m sure you’ll be 100% satisfied as I was. Also free 1gal boogie brew compost tea every Tuesday and Friday if you have your own bring it in if not it’s 2 bucks for a 1gal from them</Text>

I was actually blown away by this place.  They have everything I need in stock, from different size and type of pots, to lights, growing mediums, and all the brands of nutrients i need and want and prices i can afford. Usually I'm forced to buy more then i need and will use.  But they carry so many different sizes, its perfect for me. And go on Tuesdays to get a gallon of compost tea.  Bring a jug or buy one for $2. I have been back and will continue to go back for all my garden needs. They were also helpful with answering all my questions.<//Review>

<rating>1< /rating><Review>Usual terrible hydro experience... no one greets you when you enter....employees will look at you and continue their conversation.... Originally came in because they also post on Offerup which has completely different prices but confirmed before I went to location .....then Finally was helped by a bald orange troll looking character who had no product knowledge and even said things had features they didn’t...got to the register confirm prices and get told I’m getting a discount! Now I was a dummy for trusting without checking the receipt first, I wanted build a relationship..... Finally get in the parking lot look at my receipt to see no discount and no of the prices were the same as discussed ( they were basically retail).... Once again I take responsibility for not fully looking at the prices but then again can’t a customer trust the business to do what they say they will do? Honestly the day of experts in products knowledge are over mostly hustlers, idiots, and scammers left....No longer supporting local Hydro online is much better faster more accurate and I hope you guys adjust or go out of business as you should.... Have a great day<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>{'time': 1563405941556, 'text': 'I am sorry you were unhappy with the service and you are welcome to return any items that you are not happy with.

They answered all of my questions, made suggestions as to what I needed (without being pushy) and they were so, so patient.

I'd go farther and say they are as wonderful a crepe as can be made, anywhere, but don't have the authority for that. But I would say it. A really nice place to grab a typically French countryside Latte - in a bowl of course - a wonderful warming experience. Local, courteous & interesting service team, quiet. A winner in all respects.< /text></record>

I've only gone for breakfast a few times. Ive enjoyed the experience every time. It's great as a solo diner. The staff is friendly, food is good, great lattes and never too crowded.</review>

<name>Marianna L<//name><Text>Bistro Maxine is our favorite brunch place for over 5 years now. This place is specializing on French crepes with variety of filling choices. My favorite is poulet ala creme (with chicken and mushrooms), it tastes exactly  as crepe I tried in France, so their recepies are authentic. I love the atmosphere, location and their coffee too. Highly recommend!< /Text><rate>5< /rate><UserId.>102601079421343418558</UserId.><Time>1601099681745</Time>< GmapID>

<text>Don’t understand most of these reviews at all. I’m a regular here because the food is incredible (champingion a la creme crepe is a must), coffee is warm and delicious, the chef and staff are friendly, and the atmosphere is lovely. This is probably one of the best brunch spots you’ll find in Palo Alto.</text>< user>

It was an ok brunch place. I got the crepe and it was a but bland and dry. But the other people with me enjoyed themselves. I should say "go and try it by yourself"</Review>

<Time>1486133084236< /Time><Text>People love this place, and it's okay, I suppose. Two friends and I went toward the end of breakfast (breakfast ends at 11am, by the way), and by the time the servers took the order it was after 11am. They wouldn't let me order baguette with jam. That is a staple food. Period. Then, I ordered almond croissant. "We're out." What the what? How?

When we did get our food, the coffee and espresso drinks were fine. The crepes were well made but slightly off. Too sweet for the savor crepe to be savory. Too much uncooked brandy for the dessert crepe to taste sweet.

This is the third time I've been here, and this is the first time it's disappointed.</Text>< resp>

<Text>I went there 1 month ago. After ordering, the waiter told me that it would be 40 min wait. The it turned out it was 1.5 hour wait. I just ordered a crepe and a cup to latte.... I don't know why it took so long time. And during the waiting, the waiter just came to give me the coffee and did not come back again to ask whether I need anything...

In the food perspective, the latte I ordered was like coffee soup.... too big bowl... and the foam was not enough...

The crepe I ordered was good. Two stars for the crepe.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

My wife and I came in for omelettes. I'd have liked to use egg whites but they stopped doing that. The omelettes we're fine, definitely nothing to write home about. The other menu options didn't seem cathartic either. It was an underwhelming experience for more money than I prefer to spend on being underwhelmed. But the server was nice.</Review>

Excellent, authentic, crepes.  One of the few places that I've been able to find savory crepes made with buckwheat batter (the way it's supposed to be done).  The kitchen can back up a bit, making it slow (especially if there's an order from a large table in front of you in the queue).  The overall feel is very French, and it's on a wonderful street, definitely take advantage of the outside seating if the weather is nice.< /text>

Food was good, but not excellent or great. The price I paid wasnt justified for the portion. Of you cant eat pork, your selection is very limited and plain. Service was not bad and not special either, but the vibes my buddy and I received were not positive either, so I can understand where the other comments are coming from. I did not dislike my experience, but it also wasnt good enough to go back. Joanie's is just a few miles away and Crepevine is only a few hundred feet.</text>

The food is very good, though neither me or my friend think it's worth a 2 hour wait. I got the monte Cristo and it was very good, especially when you dip it in their home made jam. My girlfriend got the French toast sampler which was pretty good though not awe inspiring.< /review>

Disappointing. The crepes were dry and the service was poor. Our server put the plates in front of us and never returned. 3 obvious “regulars” at the next table received 3 refills of their coffee while we were there but I didnt even get one. We finally went up and asked for our check and the chef/manager/ who knows glared at us as though we had annoyed him. Felt unwelcome and won’t go back.<//Review>

This is a nice bistro just of of University Ave. It has some what of a French feel to it. They serve savory and sweet crepes as well as salads, soups, sandwiches, etc. They also have pretty good coffee. The lattes come in a bowl!</Review>

I’ve travelled the world - I’ve never seen breakfast this expensive. They burned my omelette, messed up my order and charged us extra for ordering toast on the side $10 USD+tax for 4 pieces of toast. 2 omelettes is more expensive than buying kebabs and lamb chops at a proper restaurant in the same area. Do not go to this place, better off at Starbucks or a bar.</Text>

Food and espresso drinks are very good. Service is cheery and pleasant, but sometimes inexperienced and often slow because the kitchen backs up. Last visit, it took me 20 minutes before my espresso appeared, and 10 minutes more before food arrived.</review>

Would be nice if they included in the description that they are linked to a hotel, have terrible service, don’t refill your coffee, and charge $4 for a 4pz glass of orange juice.  What a ripoff!< /text>

Coffee came 5 minutes later and I had to ask for the water 5 more minutes later when it was clear it wasn't coming. The waitress said nothing to me. Never checked in on the food, never asked if I wanted refills (I did, twice, and had to stop her as she walked by). When the check came she just set it down and walked away. When she picked it up, she said nothing. When we dropped it back off for me to sign, nothing again.

Food was alright, but not enough for me to go there again. I'll find a different breakfast spot for the week that I'm here.< /text>< pics>

Salmon crepe wasn't great. Not a good dinner option for the Palo Alto scene. Dessert crepe was on point tho. The place was being run by two 17 yr olds. They did fine, but still would have liked to have manager there.<//Text>

<Review>They messed up my breakfast order and nobody ever came by after dropping off. The guy next to me also had gotten the wrong order. No butter or jam for toast, wrong style of eggs, everything was way overdone. I actually just left without eating so I could stop wasting my time and move on.<//Review>< pics>

<date>1484427332754<//date><rating>1<//rating><review>Service was slow. Wife and i sat down and waited about 10 minutes for any type of acknowledgement, which was odd considering there were not many customers and lots of employees.

When service is slow I'm usually willing to forgive if the food is good. Unfortunately the food was not any better. Both the crepes that were served to my wife and I were not adequately cooked through. This was especially concerning since my crepe had egg in it.

In short, downtown Palo Alto has many restaurants so I can't see any reason to choose this one.< /review>< Pictures>

Very slow service even though it wasn't very crowded and there were plenty of people working. We waited over 20 minutes for our order and this other family of 5 waited over 30 minutes from when they ordered. The simple, and not particularly great, crepe & sandwich were definitely not worth the +$50 bill.< /review>

Woah the crepes are really good. Like everyone alrady wrote! We came here for breakfast on a Sat around 8.30 and it wasn't crowded. There were still a few free tables. The hot chocolate was very yummy with a thick milk foam and nice chocolate pattern:) The croque monsieur came with toast not a baguette but it was good. The service was excellent. Very nice staff! We'll be back soon!<//text>

<text>Fruit was spoiled—over ripe, waiter and manager did not take appropriate action nor did they care to replace our fruit. Waiter walked to our table multiple times.

<time>1390173808349</time><user_name>Adam Lasnik<//user_name><Pictures>None< /Pictures><text>Quite small place with rather limited seating, featuring tasty crepes and very good service.

I had the Epinard savory crepe, with spinach, ham, egg, and (on the side) crème fraiche.  It was nicely cooked, well-balanced, and decently filling... and came with a small crisp salad with a tasty vinaigrette.

Our server was attentive and efficient, and my friend and I waited under 15 minutes for our food.

As with pretty much every restaurant in the Bay Area, I was a bit dismayed by the prices (especially having had even tastier crepes in Paris for less money), but c'est la vie, I suppose.  Palo Alto rent can't be cheap.< /text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I had traveled from afar through the scortching desert, my rations long gone, I had heard of their deals. They didnt disappoint! Awesome place! Sara (without an "H" hehe:) , Shelby and of course Joy (of Joy of Life) were all incredibly warm , knowledgable, and friendly while still professional.

Just curious as to how they are getting away with five star ratings on product that is cheaper and better quality with higher THC counts right down the street from here. I’ve just browsed the menu but haven’t gone there. For 60 an eighth I would expect there to be some Live music playing with dinner included to get 5 stars. Super weird but kind of funny. Try Green Dragon or the Flower Market. It will change your Cannabis experience and your pocketbook for the better< /text>

The brunette girl working over Labor Day weekend is very unfriendly and makes you feel as if you are an inconvenience. I didn’t appreciate the customer service here, not going there again. Too many options with good service out there. Especially when you spend over $100.<//Review>

They take legitimate reviews and flood them with troll accounts to flag the real reviews. This has been going on for 3 years now. Green Dragon is the best storefront in Palm Springs  25 dollar top shelf indoor eighths when they are on sale which as of late has been consistent. Other than that use the delivery services. The flower market is one of them. Much better offers.< /Text>

Contrary to what the bitter Betty said, it is not the most expensive in the valley, they are one of the few places that won’t deceive  by putting low prices then,  oh wait there’re  the taxes which make it more than what you would pay if you just went here.  This is an honestly run business whose pricing is upfront and includes the taxes so you know exactly how much you are spending.  He’s probably an ex employee or someone who was turned down for employment with an ax to grind.  No I did not get “paid” for telling the truth in this review.<//text>

Being from out of state, I chose Joy's because of the good reviews & how calm it seemed.  Every person we encountered made the first time experience so much better.  So many warm faces.  It is worth the 15 hour drive to get here, they were all THAT amazing.<//Review>

They usually have a very expansive inventory (for such a small place). The real reason I love coming here is the bud tenders. They have great suggestions and they make you feel at home. I’ve never not left this place smiling. So the name says it all: Joy of Life.<//Review>

<review>I was a little disappointed in the weed I purchased here yesterday. The price was right but it was dry and not very good😞 It was my first time here. The girl that took care of me didn't show me more options on other product that might have been better.< /review><Rate>4<//Rate><user_id>115451650732308011857< /user_id>< pics>

Great takeout spot. Food is delicious and fresh. Staff takes good care in packing the food. Premium price is justified by premium ingredients. Just wish portion is a bit bigger!< /text>

Love the food! The folks who run the restaurant are great- they will answer questions and are very helpful in suggestions. I'm buying dinner via call and curbside pick during COVID shutdown. No problems and good food!!

<text>Happy hour here is fun.  I came on Friday night to close out the week, and got the a bunch of stuff off the happy hour menu.  Beer came out to $5 a person, and highlights were the Albacore bites, tempura rock shrimp and the shrimp gyoza that were really good, and just better than expectations overall.

We also got the surf & turf skewer and spicy tuna hand roll.  Both of those were fine, but not as unique as some of the other stuff on the menu.  The tempura rock shrimp was really well cooked and crunchy, and had a good flavor.  Albacore bites weren't as heavy on flavor, but good and light.

I like this place.  I'll probably come back to try out some of the other stuff on the happy hour menu.  I wouldn't consider it a great place for a sit down dinner or anything like that, but really good for a casual meal.  Parking is a little tricky, but manageable.  Fun overall!<//text>< Resp>

<Review>*This will be a lengthy review*
I usually never leave reviews but they really deserved it especially during the COVID restrictions. I Highly recommend this restaurant!
I was celebrating my bday and when I made reservations I requested a seat with a view. We arrived to our reservation and were quickly helped . They gave us the option of being seated immediately on the bridge or wait for our requested seating with a view (only about 15 min wait , we chose to wait ) . Everyone that worked there was SO NICE! The food was great! They even brought me a bday dessert .  (( I previously had celebrated my bday earlier that week  in L.A at a high end restaurant where I paid much more money and that service was terrible and they didn't even honor my seating request.)) The Fog harbor and their staff made up for that bad experience and made my re-do bday dinner special!</Review></record>

<Text>This place is absolutely amazing. Im originally from Louisiana so finding good cajun food has been really difficult. Let me say i CRIED when eating the seafood gumbo because it was the best i had outside of Louisiana, maybe in general! We also got the brisket po boy which was absolutely beautiful and smoked to perfection. The owner of this place brought out our food and was so awesome and nice, he made me feel like i was genuinely back home. The price for everything is amazing and the quality is A1.  If this place had beignets i think id be absolutely broke by how much money id spend here, because there's nothing here that isnt good. We did get the bourbon cake which was good, but was very bourbonie that i had to stop half way through, so if you love bourbon you will absolutely love that. 12/10 from me and def. Worth the try!</Text><user>112594728629041296995< /user>< Rate>

WOW!! I can’t believe I waited so long to try West of Orleans!! We just finished and I can wait to go back. We had chicken gumbo and black eyed peas with cornbread, slaw, and tri-tip.  It was all perfect. Plus, the service was fantastic. I’m looking forward to trying the rest of the menu. We called in our order and Trissa brought it out for us. Super easy. What an amazing local neighborhood treasure.< /Text>

If you want some good Cajun and Bbq, This is the place to go. I’ve tried the Gumbo,  Bbq, Tri Tip and Brisket and the vegetable. Everything was very delicious. West of Orleans is the best. Please give us more days!!!!</Review>

As a Baird beer fan from Japan, this place is even better. Seems they have a wider selection of beers than when we were in the Japan locations. Nonetheless, this location has an izakaya emphasis, meaning stick snacks, or snacks on a stick!

Got the chicken don buri which wasn't heavy on the sweet shoyu sauce. Lots of yumso chicken pieces.

Friendly staff overall!<//review>

Such a beautiful place and uniquely designed, the food was very delicious, we had the carne asada and eggs, truly one of the softest carne asadas I've ever had. The staff was very friendly and extremely attentive to our needs, they also have a stacked bar if you're interested in that.<//review>

My favorite restaurant in Ventura County! My go-to was the catfish poboy or the trip tip poboy! Being in the military, I would sometimes come in uniform after work and was also greeted and treated greatly. Was also given a free meal after the owner knew it was my last week being stationed in the area. Again would highly recommend going for that nice Orleans style cooking!< /Review>

Chef Marcus is back! Ribs and po'boys baby. I finally made it back here now that they opened their take out format. Lucky me they just smoked their ribs the night before. Had a mess of ribs and made a mess with them, some collared greens, and a couple bites off my wife's fried shrimp po'boy. Now that's a day off! Plus they're so friendly and will talk to you about all the menu items.<//Review>

Chef Marcus and his team are such great cooks and even better people. They cater our office about once a month and every time I am more and more impressed. I think I love his mac and cheese more than I love my wife. Do yourself a favor and order with them for your next party.< /Text>

Very thankful for the Camp Fire recovery center here. Finding good, consistent volunteers that treat survivors with respect while ensuring their digbity is understandably at times difficult. Regardless I'm still very grateful for what they provide.</Text>

As a Camp Fire survivor, I greatly appreciate the laundry and shower facility!

The church and two tent facilities need to be more clear about their hours and limits on visits and commodities.

I gave MCC 5 Stars earlier today. I just revisited and have changed my rating to 1 Star....

There were very nice attendants on my first two visits to the laundry/shower facility. This evening, there was a man attending who was EXCEEDINGLY RUDE! If there were other local options, I would NOT return here and subject myself to such treatment!

MCC lets people stay there in RVs in exchange for working on the premises and a small fee. I suspect that he is one of those, and in severe need of training!< /text>

Its a great place for the kids and adults. Plenty of things to do even workout. I am a little sad its under construction at the moment but it will only come back even better. Oh and check out the teen center they have all the schedules of events.< /Text>

<rate>5</rate><Text>What can I say Houghton Park is the place to be. If you need a coach that can teach your kids the fundamentals of the sport, they have the best coaches . I have never seen a community support their park staff as they do at Houghton Park. They have the most outstanding remarkable and unparalleled people working at Houghton Park. The men and women that work at Houghton Park are a collectively and unbelievable group of people that I have encountered in my life. Words can't describe how appreciative I am with the staff at Houghton Park. The Teen Center Coordinator Vann, has helped me become the man I am today, youth sports coach Javier with his energy level that is unmatched, and Nicole with her love and affection for the kids working in the after school program is unbelievable  ...I love going there everyday and seeing the staff working at Houghton Park. The best part is that ITS FREE so what more can you ask for< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

A bit on the ghetto side but the park is big enough to have your own personal space. Bathrooms are super dirty but the skating park is super dope.</review>

< Review>
We have been coming here since I moved to Arcadia 12 years ago. The fish is ao fresh and the service is fantastic. It feels like Henry and his wife never age. This place is truly special. Come here any time for a fantastic meal, but if you can, come on a rainy day. I promisebyou will feel like you are somewhere far, far away.< /Review>

<user>107655683446303051652< /user><Text>Loved this place, first sushi joint that is playing Japanese music vs club music lol, I though that was a nice for a change from all the other sushi restaurants we've visited, to add to that was the fact that the Soshi chefs look like they have years of experience,  and their preparation of the sushi and they way they handle it all proves and  represents the years of expertise that they hold,  the taste of the rolls and re extraordinary,  the freshness is unexplainable,  the presentation of the dishes are that of a 5 star restaurant,  I can't Express how satisfying our experience was, we've made this Small sushi spot a personal favorite,  they open twice per day for about 3 hours in the AM and 4 hrs from 5pm to 9pm, not 100% on the hours so make sure to call or look them up for hours of operation.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< Name>

Sushi was horrible and incredibly overpriced! Would never go back there. Save yourself from going there, waste of money. Took one bite of my roll and left the rest and they never asked how it was and argued with me when I said it wasn’t good. I have never experienced such horrible customer service before. Awful, just awful.<//review>< Time>

Been coming here with my pops for around 15 years. I don't get to come as often as I want because it's expensive, but it's worth every penny. I can't even eat other sushi because it just can't compare.<//Review>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Response>None</Response><review>DO NOT EAT HERE!  You will be upset with yourself when you see the bill and the quality, or lack thereof, of this place.   DON'T LISTEN TO THESE 5 STAR GOOGLE REVIEWS.  GO TO YELP AND SEE WHAT THE REAL REVIEWERS THINK.

I'm giving this place one star due to their selling tactics insane pricing and the fact that their subpar pieces are so large they are unappetizing.

These people are in the game to pull as much cash from your pocket as they possibly can.  Ordered hamachi sashimi, they bring the order and another order of the belly. Didn't think they would throw an additional charge for the belly on the bill as I didn't order that, but they did.

One chef was cutting some fish for us and his partner told him to use the scrap piece instead of the larger fresher piece.  That was the straw that broke the camels back.

Then decided to let them Omakase the food for a bit and everything they threw out was the most expensive stuff they had.  Toro, which I'm not a fan of, Mirugai, which I love, they charged as astonishing $17.00 for two pieces.  I don't love it that much.

Long story short, if you like average quality pieces so large that you can't fit them into your mouth and feel like overpaying then this is your place

The bill was an astonishing $247.00 for two adults and one 10 year old child.  This was not including the tip.

Two adults eating a full sushi dinner and drinking 12 year old Japanese whisky at Oto Oto doesn't even come to this price.  Love Oto Oto though.  They are now closed on Tuesday and that's the only reason we were at Mako

Never Never, Never again!  In a million years, I will never return!< /review>< GmapID>

<review>Arrived here on a serendipitous fluke. Missed the street of another restaurant, but stopped here because open. 2nd Best beer ever (Akiro?). Names are difficult to pronounce, but just point. English translation next to Japanese on menu. Sushi, fried vegetables were good, service fine. Spent $60 between two of us (including drinks). Nothing to complain about!< /review>< Pics>

With sushi it is important to have fresh clean fish.  So is the case at Makos.  We always have the fish soup..only $4.95!  Of course our favorite sushi is yellowtail.  I also love octopus!  We have seaweed salad and edamame for it's healthy green vitamins.  The treat of chawanmuchi completes our meal as this egg and shrimp is rare to find outside of rural Japan.  An orange, which is cut lovely i offered to each customer eating in the evening.  At lunch the meals are less expensive and equally delicious.
This small restaurant in a bit hidden strip mall in Arcadia California has the authentic atmosphere of rural Japan.
We have been customers for 10 years and have enjoyed each meal.  As with all good Japanese restaurants the prices are a bit weighty  on the pocketbook but good for the body and soul.<//Review><Date>1534216245874< /Date></record></dataset><record>

Now they get three stars. They are still over priced but the quality of the food is lacking. I shant ever be going back. Too many places to get exceptional sushi so no reason to have sub par.</review><Gmap_id>0x80c2da27572ec5ed:0x1fa85d2d4d488d75<//Gmap_id></record>

I recommend Henry's special, which is the spicy scallop hand roll.</text>< Pics>

Came here to enjoy my evening and a nice meal but was very upset with the outcome. I ordered a plate that came with sushi and asked for no avocado because of a good allergy. Happily they did that, but the reason I wasn't too fond of it is because I asked them to take out the wasabi. They brought it back and attempted to take it out. When they brought it back there was still wasabi on it. Their excuse; "Sorry he has wasabi on his hands" so there was still wasabi on the sushi. How hard is it to wash your hands and make sure to fulfill my order? On the side note, this man was drunk AF. I don't see how this restaurant is rated this high with this low of customer satisfaction. In my opinion, I would NEVER recommend this restaurant to anyone but the people I hate. Unless you want crap service and crap staff, then don't come here. I can do more complaining but if you really wanna try it yourself, take your risk.< /text>

Got 50 percent off unexpectedly and there's a lot of great stuff. Mostly furniture, but still a pretty good selection of clothes.</review>

Now that the Asian management is gone, the store has gotten worse!  People come to buy for everything and have friendly interaction!  The last 4 time’s I went to Simi Valley location, thing’s were broken by consumers because the product is stacked unreasonably!  And just to get it out fast!  The store is a mess!  There’s no one in charge and the employees don’t care if merchandise is broken and we all know why!  The Asian lady cared!  Knew people!  Now,  something gets broken by a consumer every time I visit!  They have no care about how thing’s are on shelf’s!  Tonight 2 things were broken as people were shopping!  Not the consumers fault but the employees aren’t arranging thing’s justify stacking everything on top of everything !  Glass and cookware and wood and frames all on top of each other! So sad!< /text>

Fairly large store with a lot of merch. Main gripe is the pants should be organized by size not color. No one wants to search through 400 pairs of pants to find the ones that fit.</Text>

<Review>Frequent this store and find it is well organized, and has a lot of good merchandise.
I also donate items to it, throughout the year.
Parking is adequate in front of store,  and easy access off of Sinaloa or Los Angeles St.< /Review><user_name>Jasmine Johnson<//user_name><rating>5</rating>< Resp>

This Goodwill has friendly and helpful employees, as well as incredible deals on most everything in the store. They sell furniture, toys, shoes, dresses, skirts, jeans, t-shirts, purses, and even jewelry. My only issue is they won't let you bring in any drinks so you have to throw them out or put them on their front counter while you shop. Other than that, its one of my all-time favorite shopping spots.< /review>

This Goodwill is by far my favorite. They have great items here, their workers are also very nice and entertaining. But hold on, you wont believe the finds that this place has. go down and investigate for yourself !!!! You might also run into one or two famous people here.< /text>

Really don't enjoy the count down to closing time where the yell how many minutes are left until closing time. We get it, you want us out of the store so you can go home. Most disturbing thing was witnessing a large mentally challenged man punch a 2 year old baby in the head as hard as he could, knocking the baby down! I swear this is absolutely true. Staff did nothing about this! So if you see a mentally challenged Asian man there in the evening stay away from him. I have seen him in the store twice since that happened.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Watch your money!
When paying, don't put any bills down and then fumble for other bills--you'll get snookered by the young lady that works here. Notice the camera here points at customers going near the door instead of at the cash register. Hopefully when she starts her new job she won't have to steal.<//text>

Plenty of clothes and the occasional score on brand new items.  Not much in the way of furniture or decent hard goods but sometimes you can score big with items from the local Target stores.< /text>

(Translated by Google) Very expensive, they want to sell like new, we went to look for a wheelchair, and the price of the store where they sell them new was higher, so better take the new things.

Amazing. I enjoy the shrimp coconut rolls, the pork rolls (don't know the actual name), and my go to is the red curry with chicken and extra veggies. My kids enjoy the fried rice and the prawn noodles. Don't forget to order dessert because it's soooo good!   The coconut jelly dessert (don't know the actual name) was great! Pricing is reasonable for a family and the quality of food is great!!< /text>

<Review>This place is a gem! It is ALWAYS consistent and DELICIOUS. Seriously, the best Thai and Vietnamese food. There is nothing on this menu you won't love. Especially the green curry and steamed chicken salad. Takeout is just as good from this place and they do curbside for Covid!< /Review>< pictures>

Crave.this.food!!!! Ribeye roll! Eat it. Sizzling sole is soooo good and tender and mild but yet full of flavor. Shaky beef is a favorite. Vegetable Tom Yum is so satiating.<//Review>

We LOVE Bamboo Bistro.  I picked up birthday dinner for Cheryl since we couldn't go out due to the lockdown, and of course it was fantastic.  Good portions.  Nice and hot.  EXTREMELY TASTY.  Definitely on of our favorite Go To places in Newport.<//Review>

1.5 HOUR wait for online order. I ordered through their website, it did not mention a wait time, I called multiple times (they would not answer the phone). I received an email 30 minutes after ordering saying the order would be ready in an hour (total 1.5 hours). We are locals and have dined here many time, but Will NEVER return. An hour wait may be understandable, but it needs to be disclosed upfront, not 30 minutes after ordering, plus, I cannot call them to cancel my order. We are now scrambling to find something for dinner. I am so disappointed.</Text>

Do not order through delivery service. Go there in person only. They advertise 30 minutes, and I’m about ten minutes away from receiving my order I placed at 5:10pm.

It is a disservice to advertise incorrect delivery times. It hurts businesses who honestly post their delivery times.

I didn’t ask for a refund, I asked that the restaurant start being honest so we level the playing field for other establishments who can  handle the capacity.

Order was the beef noodle soup (good), side of vermicelli noodles and vegetable fried rice.<//Review>

<rating>3</rating><text>I was really happy when I found out that the restaurant would be open near our house. This restaurant is related to Brodard Chateau which we love to introduce to our friends. However, we are disappointed that the food here is not as good as the one in Brodard Chateau even though they have the same menu. I ordered a vemicelli with BBQ pork and it came out not as fresh and the meat was really salty and chewy. My husband ordered his favorite Clay pot rice and it turned out bad too. As a Vietnamese, I can tell that the food here is not something to crave for. If you want to have better food quality, I'd recommend the original Garden Grove branch.<//text>< user_name>

Stopped by on my daughter recommendation. Ordered for two soups and eqq rolls. I was told to wait but the manager offered me jasmine tea. Friendly staff and kitchen smell very good. I saw the dishes and I want to stay but I had to take the food home. Be back. Exceptional experience.</Text>

Shrimp spring rolls. Chicken lettuce wraps. Pad thai and more - its all incredible here! This place is famous for a reason, they are incredibly consistent in what they do, these guys don’t have “bad days” like other restaurants. The food and service are perfect every single time, if you want a no-chance-at-failure experience, definitely come by. Take out or dine in, its all worth it!<//text>

Still prices were very reasonable. Had a friend that did deliveries locally and she noticed this location was popular. We went to have a slightly later lunch there for fun. Wow! Were we pleasantly surprised. This is Viet Cafe/Grill style, not a Pho house. Although they have some Pho style soup selections. For a later lunch around 2pm they had 80/90% covers filled so busy place for sit down service. Still the turn over for wait was very short. My friend had a lovely Thai Iced Tea, I had a house lager beer. We started with a simple beef satay. Nice marinade and the peanut sauce was delightful. Was pleased it wasn't chewy or over cooked. They had shrimp spring roll variety and crab (?) egg roll (?) also. The specials looked very tasty too, I recommend checking them. For entre, she had chicken/shrimp pad thai, they let her combo the proteins. Flavors were spot on for the Pad Thai. I had their specialty Shaken Beef. I've had it once before in Garden Grove. Basically trimmed fillet mignon, done with garlic, mushrooms and bell peppers. Similar to a Chinese pepper beef Szechuan style. However, the meat is cubed and better quality for Shaken Beef. I'd say the sauce is more rich too, very beefy and tangy dark sauce. Portions were spot on. For service they were busy but helpful. No reservation, walk-in. I liked the darker ambiance inside (posted pics). The macaroons and champagne in the front case looked like a tasty desert for a fancy occasion. Interesting the his/hers restroom is outside and common to the business center. Just ask for the key at the front central desk. To find I suggest be northbound on PCH, hard right turn just before the Chevron and before Mac Arthur. Restaurant is ahead on the corner on the right. Some street parking or more parking after a right turn in the neighborhood. Typical parking for the area is a bit tight, plan for a possible short walk. Don't park at Chevron, possible tow. Done with Thai food? Now go south on PCH, right at Goldenrod and follow to the beach for a pleasing sunset at the lookout. Ah, the charm of the crown of the sea. Good appetite fellow foodies :D<//review><GmapID>0x80dce0f4bc7b1e1d:0xf628b21f583cec7f< /GmapID><time>1545273732055<//time></record>

<review>This family owned restaurant is a hidden gem in the East Village serving up authentic Malaysian, Thai, and Vietnamese food. I've never had Malaysian food and tried the beef rending and it was absolutely incredible. Eating here gives you a comforting home vibe.

The beef curry was the best thing I did since writing that book on beef curries. This place has standout beef and extraordinary curry. The beef curry is perhaps the best reason to visit this place. Finally, if I had to choose... I'd say, "the beef curry at this place is unlike any other."< /Review>

The customer service here is worse than at popeyes when they ran out of chicken sandwiches.  The food is good but extremely overpriced for a horrible wait staff and hostess experience. Not to mention how loud it gets in here.</text>

Local 'hidden gem' go-to for good Pho. Casual family dinner or date spot. Solid Vietnamese and Thai dishes. Fresh and simple ingredients. Food for the healthy minded, but also plenty of savory options for the non diet restricted.

Pros: food

Cons: service can be hit or miss.

Pro tip: for some extra spice... make sure you have the chilli sauce jar (small wood jar, little spoon, with clear top) brought to your table if one isn't there already.< /Review>

We stopped here during the week for a quick lunch They had us in and out and well under an hour we had plenty of time to get back to the office.  There food whether you order out and have it delivered or go to the restaurant It's absolutely fantastic.  to be honest I can't pick a favorite item off of their menu It's all delicious.</review>

Maybe we were just extremely unlucky, but our experience was not even a mediocre one. We got placed on the 2nd floor, unfortunately next to very loud groups that had no filter. However, we had chicken dumplings that were presented very poorly and didn’t taste at all. My main dish - garlic noodles with beef - was most likely the worst Asian dish that I ever had (besides a chicken soup in Macao...). Arrangement bad, no taste, the whole thing looked like Spaghetti tossed in Thai curry sauce and tons of mushrooms and asparagus mixed in it. My wife’s wonton soup was fishy and not tasty as well. The waitress that took the order never showed up again, and we had to ask for the check at the end, and the plates etc were never cleared.

This restaurant seems to be both a Thai restaurant and a Vietnamese restaurant, and excels at neither. I had the seafood fried rice, which was bland, and the others in my party had the green chicken curry, which was underwhelming. I enjoyed the tea boba.<//Review>

<Text>I really do enjoy this location. It's east to just hop off the PCH and get dinner to go, or to sit out on their patio on a nice day and appreciate the day while you enjoy your meal. Their menu is fantastic and they are a friendly staff with great service. I recommend eating here whether your by yourself, on a date, or taking your family to dinner. The menu is accommodating to everyone.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Called in a to-go order.  Food was ready on time, order was correct and food was delicious - the steamed shrimp rolls, the summer rolls, the veggie fried rice and the zucchini noodles with tofu.  Highly recommend it!</text>

The ahi tuna spring rolls were so beautifully presented and delicious.
The stir fry shaken beef was one of the best mix of spices. The stawberry crepe was light and melted in my mouth. Yummy!<//review>

The Phuket noodle soup is the most mouth watering and flavorful seafood dish I have ever tried in my life.  Every time I come here, that is what I get.  There is no seafood soup as tantalizing as this.  The positives are that there is extensive parking in the street and around the restaurant, and this serves an amazing pan-Asian food.

The other negative is that the restroom is outside of the restaurant.  You actually have to walk around to get to it on the outside.  Also, unless you get reservations at night, you have to wait.  All in all, this is a fabulous gem of a place to dine out.  The prices may be a little higher than usual for Asian cuisines, but we are talking about Corona Del Mar in the nicest part of Newport Beach.<//Review>

<Text>Excellent Thai/Vietnamese cuisine! Fried rices are outstanding, noodle dishes as well. Their crispy spring rolls that you wrap in a lettuce leaf are amazing. The Tom Kha (coconut) soup is very good. This is the first thing I have at Thai places, it usually gives a good idea of the quality. My recent favourite that I go back for every week is on the special of the month menu (3 months in a row luckily!), shrimp, crab and asparagus stir fried with egg. I am addicted to it! The place is small, I'm surprised they haven't tried moving into a bigger space, they are always full and very popular for take out.< /Text>< username>

The spring rolls and garlic noodles are delicious. The Chicken Pho and Beef Pho were very good and can be seasoned to taste. The desserts, mangos and sticky rice, strawberry crepe were a perfect ending to a great meal.<//Review>

Most Vietnamese restaurants I've visited are a little too strip mall for me. I don't know why that is, but it detracts from the experience for me. Not Bamboo Bistro...nice location and, much more to the point, great food. The Phu and Pad Thai in particular. High marks are well deserved.< /Text>

<Text>Great food :) definitely a restaurant that I will keep going back to. 👍👍👍 the only little drawback is that the restroom is outside down the sidewalk up in an ally on your right side. Needs a key to get there. Otherwise the restaurant is fantastic and always full.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

Awesome fresh (spring) rolls, good food every time, would eat here everyday if I could... everything on the menu that I have tried is excellent. Do not forget about the free underground parking garage!< /review>

Great fresh food. Good service, though depends on the day. Crowded wait during meal times. Bathroom outside with a key. But amazing food.< /Text>

Fantastic Vietnamese and Thai food, great service.  I recommend the Pho Ga or the Pho with tofu.  Also the veggie spring roles with peanut sauce. The owner is Vietnamese and also a Registered Dietitian so the cuisine is both authentic and healthy.  There is a small restaurant downstairs and also a beautifully decorated larger area upstairs.</Review>

The best and most likely the only Vietnamese restaurant in Newport. The ground beef, chicken, and seafood egg rolls are a must try.

Parking is in the back. Few seating in restaurant. Restroom is a pain to get to and located outside.< /review>

Super quick service and rather expansive/diverse menu, but the rapidity of service was reflected in the details of some of their platings and the way some dishes were seasoned.</Review>

The food is very good and service is prompt after you get seated. The curry with rice, pad thai, pad see ew, and pho are pretty good. I recommend the red curry with brown rice, very very good. Parking is street only so it's a bit tricky, but go to the back neighborhood and you'll find something.< /Review>< Date>

My favorite is their vermicelli noodles with the BBQ pork and eggroll. I’ve found it to be reasonably priced, especially for the area. We’ve also ordered the spring rolls, not sure how they compare to Brodard’s since I haven’t been there yet. The only down side is that parking can be a hassle.</Text>< Pics>

<user_name>Robinson Ivory<//user_name><Text>I've been here a few times but on my last experience I had to wait about 30 minutes for a table after calling in and then telling me you'd only be 5 minutes. I then ordered food with my date and then they took another two hours to serve me. The food was all right of course but I felt extremely neglected and almost felt as if is staff was talking poorly about me on top of the bad service.<//Text>< rate>

< Review>
I won't lie to you guys. We went on a miniature adventure trying to locate this wonderful place. Can't decide if it's because we are special, or because this place is in such a tactical location that not even the hide and seek world champ of 2027 could find it. Anyways enough of that. Let's get down to business, to defeat the Huns. Woops. Those are lyrics to Mulan. Sorry.

Seriously though. This place is delicious and I would highly recommend it to any noodle loving food connoisseur. Upon arriving at this little eatery on the corner, directly across from a conveniently located gas station for all your late night needs, we were greeted by friendly staff eager to serve their customers. Not even thirty seconds had passed and we were already being asked where we would like to sit and being directed to a table. Before you could even get comfy in your chairs we were already being asked what we would like to drink, not that this is a bad thing because I'm a thirsty guy. But wait, there's more. "Would you like ice with your waters?"  You're damn right I'd love to put frozen water in my liquid water to make it a bit colder on an already cold and rainy night.

I had never been asked before if I would like ice in my water. Most restaurants assume it's something you want, but I was very pleased that they would even ask. Definitely brownie points. A little later into visit, after starting at their mouth watering menu for a solid twenty minutes me and my companion, who is very cute by the way, ordered the Chicken Pad Thai for herself and I ordered the Beef Pho Bowl, or Pho Bo for short. The wait wasn't too bad, about 10 minutes. Plus I'm a firm believer in hunger is the best seasoning. When the food came out and arrived at our table, I took one whiff of my dish and immediately went to a noodley heaven. I transcended through noodle space and time and found myself in a bathhouse. Except the water was not water. It was a rich and tasty beef broth that was capable of bringing even the toughest man to his knees, and a tear to his eye. Not unlike cherry pie by Warrant.

I felt like I was in a 5 gum commercial. Every seasoning was so pronounced. I could literally taste each flavor dancing on my tongue. At one point there was the macareina, and halfway through the bowl they changed it up and we're doing the tango. All while this was going on, I was slowly being wrapped up in a noodle blanket covering me from head to toe. I could die a happy man. The warm noodles radiating heat throughout my body. I could do the Polar Plunge naked up in Big Bear and not even flinch at the sheering icy winds or freezing water. Which I actually did earlier last week. My feet almost fell off it was so cold. But not today, because I was protected by a coat of hot noodles.

The Chicken Pad Thai was also very delicious. I had a couple of bites. Unfortunately not enough to transcend noodle space and time once more, but I would highly recommend the dish. Enough so that on a second visit it would be a strong contender for my next dish.

We also had the Singha beer which was surprisingly good. It was a lighter beer with a nice aftertaste. Complimented our dishes quite well. We originally wanted the Lucky Buddha, but unfortunately it was out. Guess I'm not getting lucky tonight :/

A brief description of the interior now. Picture this, you're on a train going through the desert. Nothing but sand for miles and miles in every direction as far as the eye can see, which largely depends on your sight. You may need contacts. Anyways that desert scene is exactly what this place isn't. This joint is very quaint and cozy, in the best way possible. If I had to guess you could have about 40 people eating here max. But it works perfectly. Bamboo accent all around the walls, nice wooded flooring and tables. Felt like home. If home was a delicious Vietnamese Fine Dining establishment. Anyways I would highly recommend this place. It would have got a 5/5 stars but the bathrooms are a mission to find.<//Review>

Just over a week ago, my now husband and I hosted a wedding rehearsal and welcome dinner in Bamboo Bistro's private dining room upstairs from the main restaurant for about 50 guests. The owner Chau and her team worked so hard to make sure that all the guests were attended to and felt welcome, and ensured that there was WAY more food to go around. :) (my parents and relatives happily took what seemed like endless leftovers back to the hotel for the next day's breakfast and lunch). We're so grateful that we found this restaurant; everyone kept talking about how amazing the food, service, ambience and space was, and the quality of the wine. I can't even count how many people raved about the food and how fresh and tasty it was; we even had some people who had never tasted Vietnamese food come, but quickly became converts! We had many guests come from overseas, and now that they are back home, they still can't stop raving about the welcome dinner here!!

We knew we wanted something Vietnamese for our welcome dinner since there would be no Vietnamese food unfortunately at our wedding reception the day after, and we wanted it to be within 30 min. driving distance of San Clemente, where our wedding was. Westminster and Garden Grove, where most of the great Vietnamese restaurants are, would be way too far away, and we just happened to come across this place since it's a sister restaurant of Brodard Chateau.

The restaurant offers a number of multi-course banquet style menus, and all are incredible value for both the quantity and quality of the food. In fact, I think we chose the second cheapest option, but you'd never guess this based on the variety of dishes and proteins and how good the food was! The most popular dishes by far that were served were the seafood claypot, the shaking beef with garlic noodles, and the mango sticky rice. The tastes are authentic but with modern twists, which even pleased my Vietnamese mother, who is extremely skeptical of anything that is "modern" and not exactly like what she grew up eating in Vietnam. Setting up the private dinner arrangements and a few customizations was so smooth and seamless; Chau was quick to respond via email and incredibly apologetic (unnecessarily so) when she responded even just a day or two later).

The private dining room space is really beautiful - modern, but with lots of traditional Vietnamese touches and paintings/decorations. It felt so comfortable, cozy, and refined without trying too hard. It's like a bigger version of the main restaurant downstairs.

The service was super attentive and someone was always quick to come to my side whenever I needed even the slightest thing. I am really in love with Bamboo Bistro, the owner Chau, their menu and entire staff, and my husband and I are so grateful to have found them and had our welcome dinner there. When we are back in the area, we'd happily come back to eat here again and would recommend it without reservation for any meal or private dinner party.<//text>

Worse place to order To-go!! Called in place my order and was told 30-45 min, arrived to the store within the time frame, and the I was told it will take another 30 minutes because they were busy, employees were very rude and did not seem to care, not coming back for sure.

Ps.- they advertise themselves as a Vietnamese restaurant, but while I was waiting everyone seemed to like more the Thai side....</Review>

<review>(Translated by Google) Really delicious house
Noodles are delicious, steak salad, fresh vegetables and meat sauce
Best restaurant I've been to in a few days
Service managed
I need to come back

(Original)
정말 맛있는집
국수도 맛있고 스테이크 샐러드도 야채가 신선하고 고기양념도 잘 어우러진 최고의 맛
요 몇일사이 다녀본 맛집중 최고
서비스는 그럭저럭
다시 와야겠다< /review>< user_id>

< Review>
I like coming to Ross during the pandemic you can't use the dressrooms it's crowded in there, kids running around and crying  everywhere lol I can't wait for kids to go back to school for some peaceful shopping lol they have everything tho shoes, clothes, under clothes, Electronics, kitchen items like pans, cooking stuff, chairs, small tables, lots of other things. the staff is friendly they have one line to pay and one line for returns they cashed us fast tho. they have Security in the entrance always greeting customers at the entrance you must wear a mask at all times they have shopping carts. they have shampoos, makeup brushes, purses they have clothes for every one, lots of parking space too<//Review>

Traveled far! Dissappointed in service at first! Bought a lot of things and found out we left some of our purchase at the store! Hoping that when we call the store when they open they have our things put away for our retreival! We even had to go through security because the cashier didn't get some tags off so we don't understand how we didn't get all of our purchases! Our things were put behind front counter for us! Thank you Ross store!< /Text>

<username>Katia Ruiz<//username><Review>The employees are good and always welcoming. The only reason I giving it a 4 star instead of 5 is because it's a bit on the messy side. Which then makes it hard to walk through the aisles with a shopping cart. They do carry a variety of items and at good prices.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><Gmap_id>0x80ea40f8c614304b:0x80e06b6953c94d5<//Gmap_id><Response>None</Response>< user>

<text>This was a clean store. All the people were polite. I got my daughter a pair of pumas. These were nice sneakers that would have cost over 60 dollars in a sporting goods store.  I got them for 35. Sweet. There are treasures at Ross but you must know what you are looking for and be willing to look.</text>< user>

<Name>jordan carr</Name><Time>1540435941202< /Time><rate>2< /rate><Text>Different Ross stores have different stuff they keep in stock.  Some Ross are great for for different stuff.  This Ross never had a good supply of men's clothing.  I've been to this location many times over the years but they just never have very many men's clothes even after they claim," a new truck is coming in.". Just go next door at Kohl's and check out their clearance section, you'll find much more for better prices.  Maybe they have a better selection of women's clothes, but I don't recommend this store for men and boys.< /Text>< Pics>

Clean and organized store. Many good deals. Nice staff. My problem is with one of the workers. I wanted to buy a pair of shoes that were missing a price tag. I asked the male worker that was ringing up my items if he can find out the price and he said that they're $30. I told him that I saw similar ones but a different color that cost $20. He didn't believe me and asked for proof. So, I went back to the shoe aisle and found the exact same shoes for $20. He still didn't really believe it, so he made sure the price tag was really for the shoes. When he checked on the computer, the price was like I told him. He then rang me up for that price. I thought that was very sneaky. And he could have sent someone else to look for the price if he wasn't gonna believe me anyways.< /Review>

Came in with my mom and was greeted immediately. Place is a grade level above a thrift store. Lots of stuff to choose from. With the help of a worker and a frequent customer. I found a nice dress and a pair of shoes. New and In good condition and for a good price. The lines were long but I was surprised and pleased with the quickness of the cashiers, 3 running. I will be a return customer</Text>

<text>It took over 20 plus minutes to check out. The line was in the clothes. I was told the only have 2 checkers to keep the prices low. But there were plenty of employees working. I understand it's a discount store. But pulling another employee to manage the line for a few minutes keeps the loss prevention down and saves everyone money.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

<text>My go to spot for clothes. Have to really look to find what your looking for. Clothes are priced cheap but not cheaply made clothes. Need more staff for cleaning up and putting things away.

Ahh this is an oasis of products. You will almost have to walk out with something in your hand. They have everything from clothes, jewelry, watches, Kids, toys,  art and they even sell candles. I love this place, they have things from all over the world and do a great job stocking holiday season  with all the little things you need to decor your place. Guys, they have shoes, gym stuff, water bottles,  car stuff and perfume.not low quality but high end perfume.</text>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>I usually avoid going to Ross stores because the shelves and racks are so cram packed worth inventory which makes it almost impossible to find anything.  And don't get me started on the inventory all over the floors.  It always amazes me when customers are so pathetically lazy.
This store was AMAZINGLY clean,  bright,  open and organized.  It was truly a delight.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x80ea40f8c614304b:0x80e06b6953c94d5<//Gmap_id></record>

<text>For such long lines the line goes fast, which is important to me. Dressing rooms are nice and private, with doors Instead of curtains. Large selection of pet and home goods, not just clothes. I got an incredible spiced honey spread, two dresses, and a rug for less than I'd pay at Wal-Mart.</text>< pics>

A little to messy for opening hours. Friendly security greeting every person walking in. The carts have a pole which keeps you from taking carts to car. That's a bit too much, especially for new moms with baby and a cart full of stuff bought.<//Review>

This store is pretty well kept. There's a fairly large selection in each department. However, they seem understaffed during crucial shopping periods - leaving line waits upwards of 20-30 minutes.<//Text>

< review>
Took my mother today for her senior day shopping. Could the cashier possibly ask if the bag was too heavy with all the clothing?? Then adds 2 cal king sheetsets on top of that...  All in one bag. I was happy to have been there to help my 70 yr old mother with a rollator carry said bag. Please cashiers ask senior citizens if their bags are too heavy.<//review>

Multiple times that I have been at this location have been really bad. If it's not the associates not willing to help; which last time I checked is your job, it's  being asked to leave right on the dot if I wasn't going to be purchasing anything and be rushed out. Whoever does the hiring here needs to highly reconsider hiring people with some sort of history of customer service because so far it seems that a lot of people here don't know what customer service is.</text>

<review>This store is a MESS ...IF I could give minus 10 stars I would .....I took my daughter in law shopping and after 2 hours of shopping and finally finding everything she needed we proceed to check out ..... She spent just about 300 dollars and had 2 carts full of items and after the rude cashier gave her her receipt my daughter told me we couldn't take the carts outside ...so I said okay and asked the cashier if any employees or security could help us carry some larger items to the car because im disabled and at this point in alot of pain?? She looked at me and smiled and said NO !! I said are you kidding me ?? Even Wal-Mart provides this service ??? She just laughed and said no we don't !! So I carried what I could to my car and drove my car on to the stores approach so we could Load the car as quickly as possible cause it was cold outside !!!! NEVER AGAIN WILL WE SHOP AT THIS STORE ! AND I WILL BE CALLING CORPORATE !! YOUR STORE WAS A MESS AND YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE IS A JOKE !! BUYERS BEWARE IF YOUR BUYING ALOT THEY WILL TAKE YOUR MONEY AND THEN SEND YOU AWAY WITH NO HELP TO GET TO YOUR CAR DISABLED OR NOT!!<//review>< gmap_id>

This ross store is pretty organized and prices are great. Some of the staff are very friendly. The location is great and the store is clean, especially for a ross store. I personally think this is a pretty good Ross store compared to a lot that I've been to.</review>

I was just at Ross at about 1:15 today, July 31, 2018, and I received the worst customer service ever. The cashier, Sophia, at register 2 talked really rudely, and passed quite a few sarcastic remarks. She started dumping the merchandise in and out of bags and practically throwing them. Her attitude overall was just absolutely terrible.< /text>

(Translated by Google) These people sell clothes and not very cheap. But the labels are changed. It is not the size that says ai. I did not like. I do not recommend it

<Pictures>None</Pictures><text>(Translated by Google) I found it a Good Place affordable prices and friendly staff always. Until Saturday, November 25, in Box 6 we made a purchase, They were quite a lot, the fact is that they did not give us a Bag of the products we bought, nobody noticed that 1 of many was missing, for the Next Day we went to ask And very rude they did not look anywhere, nor did they check the cameras, since I did not have the Receipt because they did not give it to me, they did not question me about anything, they just told me Not this and it was Everything. I'm going to file a Lawsuit at this Store. It's not fair that they make a plan with tricks.

(Original)
Me parecia un Buen Lugar precios accesibles y el personal amable siempre. Asta el Sabado 25 de Noviembre, en la Caja 6 realizamos una compra, Eran bastantes cosas, el caso es que No nos dieron una Bolsa de los productos que compramos, nadie nos percatamos que faltaba 1 de tantas, para el Siguente Dia fuimos a preguntar y muy groseros no buscaron en ninguna parte, tampoco checaron las camaras, ya que Yo no contaba con el Recibo porque no me lo dieron, No me cuestionaron de nada solo me dijeron No esta y fue Todo. Voy a meter una Demanda a esta Tienda no es Justo que hagan plan con maña.<//text></record>
