My taxes were prepared quickly and with minimal fuss, and a problem we had was explained well so we could resolve it. I'm very pleased with the service I received, not just from the my tax preparer but from the people within H&R Block that provided additional input.< /Text>

< review>
I basically came to H&R just to get my taxes done because I didn’t want to do them myself this year. Ana Isbell didn’t seem very knowledgeable on how to actually prepare my taxes and when I would call to give her information she would either call me 4-5 hours later or not call back at all. I didn’t feel real comfortable with her preparing my taxes. But if anything is wrong, I will obviously blame my H&R tax professional.< /review>

<review>It's convenient to be able to leave your documents prior to your appointment, then come by later and have your taxes DONE.  I just signed the documents, paid for the service, and VOILA - I was finished, in about 30 minutes.  I use the same professional tax preparer, Terri, every year.  She's fantastic and very knowledgeable!</review></record></dataset><record>

Too pricey for a simple file of tax and not to mention she (Ava Isbell) put the wrong address on these federal documents and never apologized for it. You had one simple task.< /Review>

<Text>These guys are insanely expensive!
We waited until the last minute to file our taxes because we knew we would owe. Instead of filing for an extension, like we should have done, we decided to bite the bullet and go. While the staff were very polite, our tax preparer wasn't exactly thrilled with our hot mess we presented to him. Now, while I understand we should have gone in earlier or filed the extension, this is his JOB, right? He is getting paid to do a job, and do it right. He obviously didn't feel this way. Long story short,  we ended up paying almost  $600 when we were told roughly 450 and we owe almost 17k. We were upset so we went back to the CPA that we used to use (and should have gone to in the first place) and he can already alleviate at least $600 from what we owe. H&R block only cares about 1 thing, how much money they can squeeze out of you.< /Text>< pictures>

<review>Great experience at US Storage...Not sure if I would've gotten better service or a better deal anywhere else, because i did call around. I got a great deal over the phone, then when i got here Dave gave me an even better deal then expected.  Reasons for getting a storage is stressful enough, but this but dealing with this guy, I have to smile...Thanks...<//review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNKj25q7-oJL9rUSQ3AlITNgyzvM8T3qmiC8hSE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< Resp>

<text>Angie is the best. I was clueless about storage units (never rented one before). She informed me on all the ins and outs and made sure I got the correct size unit. If you are looking to rent a space....hit up Angie, you won't regret it.
P.s. the facility is secure and clean...👍🏽</text><Rate>5</Rate></record>

Great staff - especially Vanessa the manager. I've been storing here for 3 years now and i have always felt my belongings are well taken care of. Facility is convenient and its nice knowing  the fire department is right across the street. I'll always come rent here if needed... as long as Vanessa is managing !< /text>

Vanessa was very professional and knowledgeable about the facility and the industry.  I appreciate the cleanliness of the property as well as how well convenient the location was. This is the place I'll refer my friends to. There are a generous amount of cameras, strategically placed. I feel comfortable having my belongings in such a safe place.  Thanks for providing such good customer service at such an affordable rate.</Review>

Extra Space Storage is perfect for my needs. The staff was really helpful when I was trying to figure out how much space I would need. They took the time to listen to what my needs are, what my work schedule was like and that I very much enjoy being by myself when visiting my unit. They found me the perfect space in the perfect location within the facility. It's very quiet when I'm there which is exactly what I was looking for and the facility in general is always clean... especially the bathroom which is very important to me. I would be happy to recommend Extra Space Storage to all of my friends and let them know they can rest assured their personal belongings will be safe.<//Review>

<review>This is the first time I've used you u.s. storage. A dear friend had a stroke and we had to put her possessions and storage very quickly.

From the time I called to make the reservation, Vanessa made everything so easy. She so great and made the process so much easier for me.

The day we moved everything in, Chris was on duty and helped us a lot and made that part go very smoothly to.

I compared prices at several places and there's was the best, very reasonable.

I very highly recommend them!</review>< pics>

Great service, clean and wide driving aisles and staff is knowlegable. The manager Vanessa is really helpful and helped me find the perfect space for my needs. They are very secure and they have all sorts of boxes and other merchandise in the office. Access hours are good and price is very reasonable. I appreciate the insurance options. I would recommend this storage to all my friends</Text>

My experience with Extra Space Storage is great. Jordan has a great personality, very friendly and professional. The property is always clean and organized and a pleasure to store my things there.  I explained to Jordan that I was here from out of town working and that my schedule was very tight and I am extremely busy. What really impressed me with that is out of all the customers that she manages she still remembered that and gives me courtesy calls as a reminder. Its the small things that count and I appreciate her greatly. After I had rented the space I still wanted to look and shop for a better rate and found one but the service nor the property competed with Extra Space Storage. Look forward to continuing my storage needs there great job Jordan keep up the good work!!!< /Text>

So... can you please explain why you would evict a person from your storage facility who pays her bill on time every month merely because another customer "felt uncomfortable" with her being in her vicinity... when said person was at her locker, going through her own belongings?  Has this world really come to a place where there is no compassion?  Do you really discriminate against the homeless who pay their bill just because their appearance may cause some snowflake customer to feel uncomfortable?  SHAME ON YOU!</text>

WOW customer experience is all I can say!!! The quality of service I and my family received from Vanessa was of the type I expect from the #1 ranked companies in terms of Customer Care/Customer Service. Most outstanding service I have ever received.  I was in a tough spot not feeling well exacerbated by back and knee pain and my family was stranded in a hotel while I was trying to get off work to deal with a moving emergency during a time of crisis.  Vanessa heard my "pain" and quickly offered solutions and service that had our problem solved in minutes and an hour.  Thank you for hiring such a dedicated and caring business professional.  We are indebted to you and I look forward to closing our relationship with another storage service and doing business sorely with US Storage.<//Text>

<Review>We had to find a home for our camper in a hurry!  We called Extra Space. Jordan promptly answered the phone & she had a space!  Jordan was professional & personable on the phone - as well as later in person - while she explained dimensions & pricing of the space. She gave us simple directions.  We drove to the location, filled out the paperwork & moved our camper into it's new storage home.  Thanx Jordan & thanx Extra Space!</Review>< GmapID>

They are unwilling to work with me and allow me to make a  payment for the prorated 10 days, and forcing me to pay a full month of rent, while only using the space for 10 days.  This is after 4 years of continued business and on time payments.

<review>This place is great. My wife and I stopped here after our morning hike today, best milkshakes ever!!! This was not our first time and it does not disappoint! Workers are incredibly helpful, great service, we went for one Oreo shake and we had to go in for another we went with the strawberry. Real strawberry coming through the straw we loved it. I went with the bbq bacon, I love my bbq sauce I love that thick bacon and grilled onions, this is a big burger I ordered it medium, i was loving every bite. Cooked to perfection fries were also great they’re regular fries were more than enough for my wife and I. She loved her junior burger with pepper jack and mushrooms as well. Two very satisfied customers after our hike. Keep in mind we are in COVID time we had to eat the burger outside it wasn’t the prettiest as I was devouring it, you cannot eat this with one hand, these burgers have real flavor and real juice from the meat, come prepared.<//review>< Rate>

<Review>I accidentally called the mill valley location and spoke to a woman over the phone who was incredibly rude!! When we realized we called the wrong location she immediately hung up on me before I could say another word... I don’t know how you can employ someone like that, let alone having her answer the phone and speak with customers. The sad part is I love their burgers but I remember dealing with her at the San Rafael location as well. Don’t think I will eat here any more.</Review>< Pics>

A regular customer at the Sir Francis Drake location and the burgers are the best. They use top quality beef and fresh ingredients. The fries and shakes are excellent as well.<//text>

<Review>The burgers here are the best in Marin County.
So full of flavor and a wide array of options.
Their giant burgers are huge!
They also have juniors as well as vegan options.
If you order french fries, a regular order is more than enough for two.
Their onion rings are fabulous.
Looking for good old fashioned food, this is the place!</Review><Rating>5< /Rating>< Pictures>

I don't have much to say on this one except for the turkey burger. It's what I always get. It's very good. It's why I go there. I've had the basic burgers which are good too in a traditional burger sense but I'm a creature of habit when it comes to Pearl's. My friends rave about the specialty burgers which one day I might try but they're huge!

50's style place, limited seating but once you're in, it's comfortable and the people that work there are always, and I mean always nice and helpful. I've seen many of the same people there for years which is a good sign for an establishment.

Probably the defining moment for me at Pearl's was standing in line with Robin Williams a number of years back. He liked Pearl's too.< /Text>

I came to Visit San Francisco from Houston TX and I have eat many Burger's at different places in Texas but this place the owner did a excellent job never eat this type of burgers till today and I wish if she can open one more location in Texas. Love this place has to visit this place if you are in San Francisco it's like you went to San Francisco and didn't see Golden Gate Bridge. Thank you my whole family of ten liked it what they ordered.

Pearls Phatburgers is one of our favorite burger joints in Marin. I have never had a bad burger here and they have many creative  signature burgers to choose from. Their milkshakes are excellent too and made with fresh local ingredients. We really enjoy this place, I only wish it was further from my home so I didn't go as often since burgers and fries are not exactly on the heart health menu!<//Review>

Had the Kobe beef avocado burger, which was one of the best I ever had. Sweet potato fries are good too! Their menu of burgers is so expansive that I see myself coming back many times even though I don't live nearby.</text>

Lots of options, including gluten free. The gluten free bun was pretty dry, but that's normal for GF buns. The sweet potato fries were great!</Text>

An absolute downgrade compared to the previous owners (Pearl's Phat Burgers). Everything they've changed has been negative, and the food just isn't as good as it used to be. A shame, since Pearl's used to be one of my favorite burger places in Marin!< /text>

Ok burger | horrible sweet potato fries.  I'd pass on a place in which you have to order a Kobe Burger to get a good burger.  Of course it's good you used Kobe Beef...< /Review>

I'm a big fan of the Hawaiian burger, but really all the burgers are filled with juicy artery clogging deliciousness.  You can get burgers in a smaller quarter pounder size which I uaully go for.  Tyler Florence did a "Best Thing I Ever ate" on the bacon cheese burger. You can go fancy and get Kobe Beef or Buffallo meat patties on your burger. They also do sandwiches for the more health conscious.<//Review>

< Review>
Frozen Costco burgers. I had a turkey burger ... it was just a really bland frozen puck. I mean they cooked it, but it wasn't fresh. I can't remember the last time I was in a restaurant that just put a frozen patty on the grill.

I watched them slap frozen beef patties on the grill as well.

Anyway, substandard fare. I can't believe this place survives in upscale Mill Valley.</Review>

Very Cold beer 🍺👍.  3 stars because it is a little pricy. 3.89  for a 24 oz beer! And the guy made me wait almost 5 minutes before paying because he was handling some hot food.<//Text>

I love this place and more importantly, so do my dogs!  The staff treats my dogs with absolute love and care and have an excellent beside manner.  The doctors are especially careful to make sure the pets are comfortable and as safe as possible. I moved and found a vet closer to home but ultimately came back. They are worth extra drive!< /review>

Laguna Creek Veterinary Hospital has been the vet for our dog for over 7years. We have continued to use their services as they are top notch! They treat our pet with love and respect and I always know that she is getting the best care.  They are very responsive to my questions and need to have my pet seen (worked into the schedule quickly). I would highly recommend them as a veterinary hospital.< /Review>

The staff at Laguna Creek Veterinary Hospital are AMAZING. They have always taken great care of my cats at their appointments. They are very informative and never push you to get something you don’t need, they also try and help you save costs as much as they can. Both Doctors are extremely professional and use personal experience to help first time pet owners make decisions. My cats, Salmon and Tuna, love the staff as much as the staff enjoys their names and name tag quotes!<//Review>

I've been taking my pets here for YEARS. Rats, cats, dogs..
They're a little more expensive than other places I've gone to, but they're DEFINITELY worth it. Everyone is so friendly and caring. ALL Veterinary locations should be trying to emulate this business.< /text>

Dr. Purwal and Dr. Vandoren are the absolute best. I started going here after bad experiences with some of our local VCA hospitals and I am happy I did. I feel they communicate my pets needs to me very well, and offer helpful suggestions to guide me down the path for my healthy pets, even if they are losing money! (by not performing unnecessary procedures) I have taken rabbits dogs and cats all into this vet hospital, and I will continue as long as they are in business. Thank you!!<//Text>

<Review>This was our first visit and it couldn’t have gone better. Staff were friendly, patient, and knowledgeable. We were provided all the info we needed and all of our concerns/questions were addressed/answered in a timely, competent manner and our pup was treated well and seemed very comfortable. I would definitely recommend Laguna Creek Vet, just as It was recommended to me by 3 established patients😊< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

I love Laguna Creek Vet Hospital.  I have been taking my fur babies to Laguna Creek for over 10 years, and I absolutely adore Dr. Van Doren and the staff.  Not only are they extremely professional, but they have always been considerate, thorough, compassionate, and understanding.  They have been supportive through the best and saddest of times, and I greatly value their dedication.  I still have the handwritten note that Lodi sent me when one of my fur babies crossed the rainbow bridge (thank you again, Lodi!).

I always highly recommend Laguna Creek to people looking for a vet.</review>

We cannot say enough good things about Laguna Creek Veterinary Hospital.  They have been our vet for many years and have always shown compassion towards our fur babies.  We have moved out of the Elk Grove area but still continue to drive to Elk Grove to take our sweet dog to LCV!</Review>

I’ve been coming here for about 6 years & I couldn't be more happy! The staff is always attentive & professional.

Ive brought my 6yr old cat here since the day I rescued him & our newest addition, 12mo Kitten, here since the day I brought her home too! I know I can trust them to take care of my little fur babies.

You guys rock!</review>

Absolutely recommend bringing your furbabies here.  Recently, we brought our new family addition for a wellness check-up.  All was well.  COVID safety measures in full force (love that).  The vet was wonderful, informative and I can tell she truly loves what she does.  Same goes with other staff.  Other clients were also doing their part in staying safe.  This place has been here for quite a while and it really is your neighborhood pet clinic. ❤️.<//review>

I have mixed experiences there. I call concerned about my dog and the conversations are pushy and abrupt, even rude at times. In my opinion a veterinarian office should have staff that is caring and kind. I care about my pet and I want to feel like they care too. The doctors I have met with were wonderful, it’s too bad the rest of the staff isn’t.< /Review>

The front office staff is amazing and so caring.  Always pleasant on phone and helpful.  They follow up when they say they will.  We love our doctors and it’s hard to find local vets that do exotics.  They  are considerate regarding your financial abilities while making sure you are giving your pet the right care.

All the staff and doctors at Laguna Creek Vet Hospital are amazing. I’ve had my yorkie since he was 8 weeks old and he’s 11 months now. I was referred to them by my sister who also takes her two dogs; a husky and German Shepard/husky mix there.

You can tell all of the staff and doctors there have a really genuine care for the animals they treat.< /review>

I absolutely love Laguna Creek Veterinary Office. During these unprecedented times, I couldn’t be with my puppy for his first visit. The office staff were very friendly and explained the entire procedure and process for my puppy’s visit. I knew he would be in good hands when I gave him to the technician. Even though I haven’t had a chance to meet Dr. Purewal, he spent the time on the phone with me to explain my puppy’s check up and test results. I appreciated the time the doctor gave me. I would highly recommend Laguna Creek Veterinary’s Office.</review>

Came in for basically a 3rd opinion.  We saw Dr Layton, she was wonderful.  I know it was hard for her to have to tell us the not so good news about our beloved pet.  But she was the only one who I felt was honest and upfront.  DIdn't try to get us to pay $1000's in dollars to keep doing more test, just to tell us in the end that there was nothing more that could be done for him.  I will definitely be returning with my other pets<//text>

I just want to say how much I love this place! My family moved out of Elk Grove to Citrus Heights but we continue and will in the future, continue to make the drive to this vet office. What they have done for my family I will never forget. Their Dr's are so competent they noticed a new heart condition on a dental check on my 12 year old Pit. Because she was concerned, we saw a cardiologist before they would do dental surgery, rather than just take my money and put my dogs life at risk. We got the appropriate consult and started her on a new medication, new food and overall healthier regimen. We rescheduled for dental surgery and they blocked out a large portion of their day on a friday to ensure they had all hands on deck in case something happened to her while she was under. Words can not describe how much this meant to me and our family. She and her adopted brother are safe, surgery was beautifully successful and the cost was astonishingly lower than any other vet I have ever visited. They have made a life long patient from our family. Thank you so much to all of their staff, you are truly the best.< /review>

I haven't had her long and it seemed what I thought were symptoms of a respiratory infection was normal behavior. The doctor said she was healthy and just needed a slight diet change. She also said I was doing a great job and was more knowledgeable than most first time owners. I was so worried my little baby was going to die, and with $80 I was told she's healthy and I'm doing what I'm supposed to do. Best money I ever spent.</review>< Pics>

I have had great experiences with Laguna Creek Vet Hospital. We had a hard time finding an affordable vet who could do some dental surgery for one of our kitties. Unfortunately our kitty had to have surgery twice this year. The staff there is very friendly and they helped me get the best services I need at the most reasonable prices. This is our kitty Hanalei one day after surgery. I recommend them!<//text>

The doctors and staff at Laguna Creek are very professional and caring. They are knowledgeable and quick to respond to calls and questions.

They are NOT working dog friendly. As a professional handler we do not allow our dogs to be separated from us unless they are having surgery so shots and all are done with the handler. Never suggest sedating a working dog becuase when the handler is there the dog will be under control.
This place is not accommodating and rude. I will not recommend this vet to any of our units and other agencies</Text>

< review>
My yorkie gets his routine check ups yearly with Dr. Van Doren. She is great!  She listens to my concerns and helped me solve his itchy skin.

I recently had an emergency with my senior dog. He was having a hard time breathing and had a bloated belly. They sent me to Vista animal hospital for the emergency, which I understood due to the situation.  After preliminary testing and no exact diagnosis from l Vista, the doctors at Laguna Creek Veterinary Hospital reviewed my dog’s notes and got me in early to treat my dog immediately. I was scheduled with Dr. Purewall and he was so caring and understanding. He and Dr. Van Doren had discussed a treatment plan and were ready to treat my dog and get him more comfortable.  Dr. Purewall showed the upmost empathy for my dog and stayed during his lunch to perform a procedure on him. I am so so grateful for all the doctors and staff at Laguna Creek Veterinary Hospital. They saved my dog and I know he’s getting the best care.

Everyone at Laguna Creek Veterinary Hospital truly care about your animals. They are smart and work as a team to do what’s best for you and your animal. Thank you Laguna Creek Veterinary Hospital!</review>

Took my aging female cat that usually hates to be touched on her body in for a check up. Mia warmed up to the staff quickly and was letting them touch her all over without any complaints, or reactions. The overall experience was very positive from the minute we arrived, until the time I was checked out. They were quick with the blood work follow up as well.</text>

<text>Very bad phone experience trying to book an emergency appointment.  The person on the phone refused to help and started immediately referring me to other hospitals stating that they are "down a doctor" at present.  I would recommend avoiding them until they get someone less rude answering phone calls for sick pets.< /text><UserId.>114213218068790990266</UserId.></record>

My Pom Joey had his first visit to Laguna Creek Vet yesterday.  The folks there are animal lovers and will fuss over your pet.  They gave him treats so they’re his new bffs!  The vet was very kind and gentle, Joey liked her a lot.  I would highly recommend Laguna Creek Vet!< /text>

Been bringing our dogs and cats here for a while. Everything was great until they took advantage of a situation and charged us for services we asked them not to do, and was not scheduled to be done. Unfortunately my girlfriend was the one there to pay, and they told her she had to pay for it. This was on two cats, so double the charge of course. Will never recommend this place. Petty</text>

Love the vets and all of the staff. Always helpful and they never make me feel bad about my dog being 'loud'. I call in the morning and can pick up my dog's bravecto that afternoon. And my appointment reminder cards have a picture of a schnauzer on them. That is the level of service. Your appointment cards have pictures of your dog breed on them. How can you not love that?</review>

I have been taking my dogs to Laguna Creek Vet Hospital for 10 years, and the doctors and their staff are great! I recently visited with a very ill dog, and the doctor was kind, thorough, and informative. They are always compassionate, and it is clear they are very interested in helping pets stay healthy and happy. I highly recommend them to all pet parents!<//text>

I have taken my dog Connor to Laguna Creek Vet Hospital for 8 years and he has received great care. Recently he had a medical emergency. He has been diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension which has no cure. However, he has received excellent care, and I hope to have him with me as long as possible. Before that I took my cat TJ to Laguna Creek . They were so kind and compassionate when he passed away. Thank you everyone who is part of Laguna Creek Vet Hospital. I love you all.<//text>

< Review>
Even when they are busy, Laguna Creek Vet Hospital staff acknowledges me and helps me as soon as they can. I came 5 minutes to closing time to get more heartworm medicine, and they were kind, prompt, but didn't make me feel rushed. And when the vet is treating my dog, she looks my dog in the eye and gives her 100 percent of her attention, which is so rare these days. They are awesome and I have NO complaints.< /Review>

I have used Laguna Creek Veterinary Hospital since 1990.  They have provided care to my pets from puppy shots through heartbreaking euthanasia with sensitivity and empathy.  Dr. Purewal and the staff are the best and I highly recommend their facility.< /text>

<text>We have been bringing several generations of our cats here for many years, and the practice has helped us keep them with us well and happy well into their teens.  I once called Dr. Purewal the "Cat Whisperer."  You should see him butt heads with a cat and get it purring!  And Doctors Van Doren and Layton are living up to his fine example.  Lottie and all the other staff are wonderful too.  We have faith in Laguna Creek Veterinary Hospital that we are getting the best possible care for our little family members.< /text><pics>None<//pics><Response>{'time': 1528832356703, 'text': "We are so glad that we could play a part in keeping your cats healthy and happy!

While the staff was friendly and involved, and the facility itself was clean and well kept, I had a bad experience overall.  (Note: this was my first experience with this veterinarian.)

I scheduled my cat for a check-up when I noticed he started spinning in one direction instead of standing still or walking straight.  After talking with the doctor she took him in the back to do some tests in order to determine what the issue was.  Outward, there was nothing wrong with my cat. So they gave him some anti-nausea medicine and told me to keep an eye on him.

That same day I had to rush him to an emergency vet when he started having seizures.  Less than 4 days later I had to put him down.

While this vet wasn't equipped to handle brain/emergency cases, it wasn't until later I realized that the first minor focal seizure actually happened AT THIS VET while she was talking to me about what they found, or rather, didn't find and she didn't recognize it as such.  I know in my head that even if they were to have caught it right then and we wouldn't have delayed those 5-6 hours it wouldn't have made a difference.

Unfortunately, this left a bad impression on me and I'm finding it hard to go back to them.< /review>

<Review>I absolutely love Laguna Creek Veterinary Hospital.
They don't lie and tell you that you need to do numerous amounts of things to help your pets. They are truthful and honest and that is the best quality to have, as so many vet hospitals will charge you crazy amounts for different services and push endless amounts of services, therapies, medications and/or surgeries. I just took my pup in to get looked at for excessive licking of his paws with flesh increased amounts of redness, irritation, and rash. I had the doc visit, got him tested for heart worm, got two medications and heart guard for 6 months and only paid $150. I was stunned!! At my previous vet near my old house that would have been a $300-$350 visit. I would recommend them to anyone and everyone!!
Thank you for loving and taking care of my loved ones!!<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

I came home to find my Holland Lop bunny with an injured leg. I immediately called many vets that weren't able to treat bunnies. It was late in the day and i was getting concerned he wouldn't be able to be seen. I called laguna creek and they were able to treat bunnies and could take him in right away. All of the staff was friendly and took a personal interest in my little guy. Dr. Layton was so awesome answering all of my questions, providing me all of the possibilities and treatments. After xrays determined his leg was broken she explained how to treat, what to expect and when to call her if something was not right. I felt the cost of the emergency visit and xray were very reasonable. Thank to Dr. Layton and her staff, it is lucky to find such caring people.<//Review>

<Text>My husband and I started bringing our pets to Dr. Purewal in 2004 after a neighbor recommended him, and are beyond satisfied with the caring service that he and his staff provide. Our dogs are now 10+ years old and in excellent health, thanks to the routine checkups and vaccinations, emergency and dental care, understanding and advice of this excellent vet. I unreservedly recommend Dr. Jug Purewal, Dr. Van Doren, Lottie, and the rest of the top-quality staff and Laguna Creek Vet.< /Text>< pics>

<review>I have been taking my Maxx to Laguna Creek vet for two years now and the customer service and help from the staff is still superb! I've had a few emergencies (allergic reactions) and I was able to get in quickly and with a quick shot Maxx was back to normal. It is also really nice that the staff remembers you and your furbaby.

9/10/16 update - it seems after I posted my positive review Laguna Creek Vet decided to change their good service. On a recent occasion I had to prove to the office that I actually paid for a service because someone in their office did not update my account properly. I had to take time out of my day to try to find a receipt and my credit card charge from almost two months previous.  And not two weeks later, the same thing has happened from my most recent visit. I've decided to find another vet for Maxx.</review>< Rating>

<text>Okay, I just took my dog to this vet. Last year I took my cat, but forgot about the Dr. there...
The staff is wonderful, the Dr. on the other hand is a douche. If you enjoy being talked down too as if you were STUPID, then I would recommend you going here. He has down this on both occasions. Now you all might think I asked something stupid or had it coming, well your wrong. I work at a place that sells pet products and I know a thing or two about what kind of medicine is good or bad, what kind of flea medication is the best and so on. Oh yes and I also know what a SENSIBLE HARNESS is...because my dog has one and the clip goes on the front of the dogs chest. My dog is generally happy, she rarely growls at people, she's a huge people lover, but she didnt like this Dr. She must not like DOUCHE BAGS that much. During the visit, the Dr. asks if my dog is on any medications, I of course pull the bag of her meds. out and he's going through them, he starts asking " do you know what this is for?" so on and so fourth, I say "yes" then he gets to her heart-worm medicine, he says "do you know what this is for?" again my response is "yes" then I explain its for heart-worm, he then asks if I know what heart-worm is...I say yes, I know the just of it, then he asks me "is this your dog?" WTF kind of question is that, I am sure I would have made it abundantly clear if it wasn't my dog. he asked that from just me answering "i know the just of it" oh yea cause everyone goes around cutting dogs open and looking at their heart for heart-worms. Are you serious? then he points to my dogs flea medicine and asks if i know what that is for....REALLY? come on...I Obviously bought it, I know what the eff it is and what it is used for. Then he takes my dog, looks at her "sensible harness" and says "you have this on wrong" I replied "no I dont, its on right. its a sensible harness, it clips in the front of the chest not on the back so if the dog...." then he cuts me off and says "I have never seen one of these" but he said it in a tone that made it seem like I was lying about it, which to me is funny since, I again bought this and know how it works.
I was reading some of the other reviews on here, and I find it funny that one says "vets are extremely friendly and real animal lovers" cause in this case that is false. This (India) Indian guy seems like he doesn't like or cant handle medium sized dogs very well, and he also doesn't know how to approach them either. His def. need to learn a thing or two about talking to people and how to approach animals. I will be looking for a new Vet ASAP!!< /text>< pics>

<Review>My mother has been staying at Belmont Village for over a year and so far we've had very positive experiences.  The nurses, managers, pals, maintenance, and restaurant staff have all been very professional and kind.  Joanna, Chef Marx, Rick, Eileen, Zack, Jackie, and Michelle have all helped my mother get situated and integrated into the community.  My mother says she's happier there than she's been in the prior 10 years.  When my mother broke her ankle, the nurses and pals really stepped up to help keep her safe.  I am very grateful for the Belmont staff and facility.  Both my mother and I sleep better at night because of them.</Review><UserId.>117864119450145600266< /UserId.><GmapID>0x80857ecd03fd63b1:0x2290f36ac9a50e39</GmapID><time>1597948598345< /time><Response>None<//Response><username>Sun H<//username></record></dataset><record>

A bustling senior center. As a senior I appreciate the cleanliness and activity. Facility is close to some shops and an eatery or two. Some City road construction is only a temporary hindrance. Residents interact with each other. Nice sized dining room.<//text>

<Time>1611099549034< /Time><review>This is a storage unit for seniors. The staff is not only inattentive but neglectful. The head of "wellness" could not point us to the nearest ER. My relative's toilet overflowed and it took 48 hours for anyone to notice even though he was leaving his room in his underwear to use the hallway bathroom. Once Covid hit, no one was in to clean his room for weeks. It was only when our outside caregiver was allowed in that we discovered how filthy it was.  Was my father in danger here? Not immediate. But was he well taken care of? No.<//review>< resp>

< Review>
My grandma has been living here for around 2 years. A few days ago she left the facility out the back patio gate. When they reviewed the camera footage they didn’t contact my mom for several days. I know she Is not in memory care but this is still concerning because residents are supposed to sign out so Belmont is aware. No one even noticed that she had left. On top of that the alarm went off and no one heard it. Please note that happened during quarantine where residents are under tighter security. I am getting concerned about the well being of my grandma.< /Review>

<Review>To all the Belmont Albany Team members,
Thank you, thank you, thank you for keeping us safe, fed, involved, and interactive in the community.  Who knew Covid
would happen, but you have all risen to the occasion, and are helping us cope  in many ways.  Life has gone on as usual,
with many changes, but after two years of being here, I realize it is a great place to be.    Thank you all,  Diane< /Review><Rating>4</Rating><Name>Diane Ichiyasu< /Name>< response>

<review>Every time I come here to provide an essential service, the front desk employees  are VERY RUDE, COLD AND BRASH!!
This place probably needs to be audited in every way!!! Financially and via the 1st Amendedment. Especially someone to check on their residents! There is definitely some sketchy stuff going on at this place. I feel it everytime I drop something off.</review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>{'time': 1597351252003, 'text': 'We are sorry to hear about your experience.

<review>Nice for senior living, parking structure, ♿ parking and ♿ accessibility entrance. Clean, has a Bistro, full dining room with chef and different choices for meals daily, several activities for residents, cleaning staff for residents room's, 🚻♿ restrooms for visitors and staff very clean. They do have a wellness center for medication and well checks. Only thing is they are under staff for building and number of residents. Very pricey.<//review>< pictures>

I visited this place five times, twice for meals, and went through their admissions process. Each time I entered the huge entry room I felt depressed. It has a large piano with canned tinkling music emanating from its insides and fake flowers dotted around. I never saw more than one-three individuals sitting in the vast space.
There was never a sense that there is any sort of spontaneous community there. I saw very few people going in or going out.  Maybe there is a back door to a parking lot I missed.

On reading their literature it seems one woman developed the three-tiered concept in another state from her Alzheimer's father needing care. Thus, the 'independent living' folks seem, to an outsider, to be pulled down into dependency by that original origin. That is, I originally thought it was a way for older adults to 'age in place' and do everything they would do if they lived in their own homes, but feel secure 'in case' they ever needed more care, but I then saw it as actually starting with the idea that they DO need more care. The managers, a nurse and a longtime former HR manager at a hotel (completely different skills from managing an independent community) seem to see the 'independent livers' as needing their 'care' from the start. For instance, they want to know if and what medicines the independent residents take so they can have someone monitor them. ('You'd be surprised how many people forget to take their medicines'.) There is a rule that a staff person goes into each apartment two (2!) times a day to 'collect the trash' A resident I sat with at dinner suggested it was due to nosiness. Otherwise, such intrusiveness makes no sense. -- All the staff have keys to each apartment.

The last two choices of apartments available were very small and have only a view of a wall or busy, unpretty San Pablo Ave.

I was shown a large concrete patio (I was told there are more!) with sad small trees in places which I would never be drawn to sit in. I didn't see a garden for planting or enjoying outside, nothing to invite resident participation. No people were in this one and I bet people rarely if ever went there.

I didn't see pets and doubt they are allowed.

I didn't see a single child during each of my visits. Who is it who thinks that old people need to be only with other old people?

They seem to think elders want to be pampered. The dining area (two meals a day are paid for) is built like a restaurant, with orders taken by waitresses. There is a long wait. The food was good enough the two times I ate there. My daughter came with me once and ordered salmon which turned out to be farmed. I didn't ask what percentage of the food is organically grown but I doubt it is high..One resident told me she could get brown rice if she asked for it. Real-life examples of food available for choosing was set out at the entryway to the dining area; I felt hurt at the waste that caused every single day.

A friend's husband with Alzheimer's stayed there for a time. But she felt she had to go and feed him three times a day because he wasn't getting properly fed by the caretakers. She paid over $8000/month for his care.

I felt patronized, by both the nurse and the former Human Resources manager.

I missed an art room; the idea that residents create their own programming; spaces with nature to walk in and work in; and natural indoor design rather than a sense that decor is there to impress.  Thr architecture is not designed for light and nature. There was no bustle and no sense of friendly, spontaneous community. Even the waitresses didn't say hello though I had interacted with them at lunch before. They didn't speak to the residents either

The managers exude a sense of knowing what's best for residents.  I felt smaller having been there, shrunken, didn't see how I could take a deep breath and expand  It is definitely designed for 'the last years' and one could see the end. As a longtime former trauma and family psychotherapist and educator, I could imagine my last years cut in half if I moved in there. So I didn't.<//text>

Been coming here lately. Enjoy the service and love they put into their product and with how they do their wings.... delicious. I don't like fried wings and these guys bake their wings. Pizza is also yummy as well but of course in my opinion, the crust needs a butter garlic sauce on it.
There are also multiple specials and deals as well.< /Review>

<Review>Best pizza ever! Whenever the family has a craving for pizza, hot and tasty is our number 1 place to go. The quality of the pizza is fenomenal and the service is always great. No need to spend extra on these overpriced pizza chains, when hot and tasty is all you really need.<//Review></record>

<Review>Been coming for years but apparently you literally have to pull pure definition out when you order. I ordered 3 pizza 2 topping each cause a sign inside said 6 dollars each. but when I paid it was 24 dollars. when I brought it up to him because that when it clicked to me that it didnt add up(it was a long 24 hours for me so mentally tired) he said I had to mention the special. Dude its ur business with a sign on the inside and outside you knew what I was talking about when I ordered that. I can understand human error but he reacted negatively and said well you should have said that.... no you should know what i ordered when i said that. its ur business and its ur prices you knew what I ordered when I said that. its not like some special that's rare it's been the same. well personally if he was sorry about it and refunded the few bucks than I let it slide and move on but the way he acted towards me was beyond unprofessional and I personally will not be coming back.< /Review>< gmap_id>

I order the large pizza and wings combo for $10.00. The pizza is not very good. Didnt have very much cheese. The wings are very small maybe cornish hen instead of chicken. Food is cheap and thats it.  Not impressed with the food at all.<//Review>

<text>After a long weekend exploring wines in the Santa Ynez valley area, Beckman was my favorite. Beautiful full flavor wines...tasting at the vineyard (rather than an in-town store experience) ...and unique farming methods. Even my beer-drinking husband enjoyed the wine!</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< user>

Great winery to visit around Los Olivos! Wonderful wines, great staff, lovely surroundings. Nice outdoor patio and picnic tables to enjoy a glass of wine outdoor in the sun when the weather is good, followed by a stroll around the grounds or through vineyards. Close to town and a good way to wrap up the day if heading back south< /review>

<Text>We rode our bikes in on a pretty warm day, so it was great to have an air conditioned tasting room and well shaded patios to enjoy.  The property itself it just beautiful, it was really enjoyable to ride into.  Thomas our tasting attendant was very friendly and accommodating while handling multiple groups.  The wines were all very good, but we especially enjoyed the grenache and syrah.  They will definitely be in consideration for joining the wine club once we are ready to add more.  If you are in the Los Olivos area, definitely make this a stop.</Text>< pictures>

< Review>
We stopped here on a Friday afternoon and really enjoyed their tasting room. They have reds and whites and a fantastic dessert wine, a '99 Late Harvest Sauvignon Blanc that was excellent.  Great staff and nice facility.  Highly recommended when in Los Olivos.</Review>

<Text>Beckmen winery has some good wine available but wines are expensive and tasting room staff are unfriendly. Tasting room is basic. Many better options nearby.</Text>< Name>

Everything was perfect. We had a great guy guiding us through the vineyard and answering our question perfect. We also had the opportunity to meet the founder and he was nice to us and took time to talk for a while. And the wines were really good as well and as other have reviewed before - they offer a small and intimate tasting room that wasn't crowded at all.

If you're looking to visit a vineyard in the area - this is the place. They also gave us recommendations of lunch afterwards and that place was also great (Sides, Los Olivos, CA).

Just go here!</text>

Suzanne was very knowledgable about the wines, served us wines that were not on the list and that really helped us to decide to become wine members. Excellent service and wines!<//text>

Seriously incredible experience at Beckman Vineyards.  Victoria was amazing and the wines were the best we have had in California! The philosophy, practices, and management of this vineyard are ways of moving forward in a sustainable world that all should embrace.  Prior to our afternoon at Beckman's, we visited a vineyard featured in the movie Sideways, and every wine was mediocre.  When we arrived at Beckman's the 8 wines we tasted exceeded our expectations--I don't want to oversell, but every wine we tasted was absolutely perfect for us.  You do not want to miss these wines if you are near Santa Ynez wine country!!< /Review>

Hands down the best fish tacos in the South Bay! Fish is crazy fresh...like it was caught same day. I'm partial to the fried or grilled fish taco. Haven't tried anything else on the menu, I love them so much.  Delicious!!</text>

Don't get me wrong the fish tacos here are Good. My family came with us eatin at the other location. First orders of the fish tacos were light with fixings.  But i order a second round and POW there were as expected without sayun a word about the first order. Delicious so in the end I was Happy.<//review>

If you want to take advantage of specials, do not use their online Postmates feature. We paid full price for taco Tuesday! When my husband explained this to the cashiers, they said too bad and said they couldn’t do anything about it. When my husband suggested providing something in exchange for the extra $ we paid, they said nope!  We love the food but would like a voucher to compensate for them not honoring their public specials, and over charging us.< /text>

Either way, you won't be disappointed. The food's great it won't break the bank account.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

< Review>
The food is tasty but the loss of the star has to do with their sudden rule about requiring $10 minimum purchase to use credit and debit cards. On one hand, they are asking you to use exact change to pay with cash because of the coin shortage and then you have to buy $10 to use a credit or debit card. It’s annoying to have to buy more food than needed for a single person and is why I can’t eat here as often as I was eating there before this stupid rule. So they have lost business from me because of it. I hope management reconsiders this decision.< /Review>

Yummy! Great food flavors that take me back to the shores of mazatlan. Be prepared to wait in line, and be sure to bring cash to tip the staff, they are hustling to get the food prepared and served with great attitudes. There is a patio.</Text>

Really good fish ceviche! Price point is excellent for the portion, generous fish ratio. I think the lemon juice is also either fully press squeezed or mostly fresh squeezed which makes a huge taste difference to me (if my taste buds are not lying). Also had the baja taco! A mix of batters fried fish and shrimp. Great batter - will get again! That red side sauce is magic.</Review>

The prices are phenomenal for fish tacos in the area. Get the grilled or the fried, Baja style. Make sure to ask for extra salsa since it doesn’t come standard. Great quality, authentic taste and great staff.< /Text>

I ordered postmates pickup yesterday and the order was ready in 10 minutes - so easy. Got the Baja Taco (grilled fish and shrimp), Grilled Mahi and the Camaron (fried shrimp) - AND I CANNOT STOP THINKING ABOUT HOW AMAZING THESE TACOS ARE. The tacos are stuffed with protein, the sauces are flavorful and spicy, the staff are incredibly friendly and efficient. Will be going back this week, and next week, and a million more times after that. Go. This place is fantastic.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

<text>Saw this place open up and had my reservations as it’s been hard to come by great Mexican food in the beach cities. Soooo glad this place did not disappoint!! We got some barbacoa tacos, a Baja burrito and the ceviche mixto and everything was beyond delicious. This place will be on heavy rotation in our household. Please support small businesses during these times and go get you some great food 🙌🏼<//text></record>

Beautiful camping grounds! Awesome that they have a FREE camping area! You just pull in your car. Almost every spot has its own fire pit and water spicket, also had paths that led down to the water. I also noticed the entire place was incredibly clean and well kept, and majority of camping spots were secluded and private! Perfect for my girl and I for a little spur of the moment romantic getaway! (Even without the tent,  and just being in the car!)<//review>

<review>Only $15, amazing sites and although the train is near it really didn't pass through too much. Restrooms were clean and nice trails to walk to. The river is great for swimming, several places to enter into and great views of mt shasta. Will plan my next trip there.</review>< userid>

There is 2-3 trains every 1 ½-2hrs that last atleast 5min long each time pass that goes all day all night. The trains have different schedules every day. Sometimes no train and they pass at different times. But if u dont mind it, its really quiet between those times (not so many people) depending on the month u choose, like winter before they close the park on november 15th. Limit of days to stay is 14. We didnt experience any wild animal run ins except fecies of a small animal in many spots on the street path and one huge pile of Bear fecies by our campsite (#2) next to drinking water faucet; which there are alot of drinking water faucets in the campground.Some campsites are private and most are very open. 3 bathroom locations; one in beginning, 2nd in middle of park and 3rd at far end where it is much colder cause of the closeness of water. A river at each side. There is fishing. Clean bathrooms; toilet and sink. Marked men and women in the middle bathroom. Lots of paths to walk through. Beautiful. Host was amazing! I forgot his name but he was a older gentleman that had a long white beard that reached a pretty good distance.$15 a night. No day use. Big spaces for rv pull ins. Very dark/blinding at night, only lights are outside/inside bathrooms so bring flash lights & batteries.Closest market is super expensive so bring lots $$ but u are supporting it locally and they do have great burritoes and good selection of groceries including fruits.</Review>

Our favorite Campground.  Right on the Sacramento River for good fishing. One reoccurring event are the trains that pass blowing their horn for the crossing.  Quite a suprise at 2 am.< /Text>

There is water, trash and Vault toilets, but other than that very minimal Campground. It is almost a primitive level of camp. There is an iron Ranger were you make your nightly payment. Wonderful creeks intersecting the area, and trails you can follow to Old Sawmills and historic CCC sites. Always great to take a quick dip in the Sacramento River as well.<//Text>< resp>

<Review>Toilets and floor were very clean. The history trail around the campground was interesting and fun. Standing on the old suspension bridge with a view of mt Shasta was very peaceful. The trains came through every hour, but were not too loud, we had fun watching them go by at the end of the bridge. Plenty of space between campsites. Blackberries are plentiful during the right time of year. For overnight camping, very nice. The very large trees made me a little nervous, limbs above the campsite could fall in some sites. Fish, tadpoles, and wildlife in the creek, and sacramento river. We had a great time.< /Review>< user_id>

Not a very busy campground as there is limited access to other areas but it really is great for a single nights stay with clean restroom and flat sites for tents. Good price too.<//review>

My experience at Extra space storage was exceptional,  they really go above and beyond and are incredibly helpful and informative!

Didn't expect such personal, attentive and caring service from a storage place..highly recommend!

Also they were the cheapest I could find.< /Text>

<review>Best experience I’ve ever had obtaining a storage unit!  Jerry was amazing. He answered all my questions, was patient and made sure that I was selecting a unit I really needed. He didn’t try to oversell and I really appreciate that. The entire staff was welcoming and I felt well taken care of (though I’m still waiting for Randy to sing). The property was well maintained as well, which is more than. Can say for some I’ve seen.

I’m hoping I’ll only need short term storage, but if I need it longer, Im happy I chose this branch.

I highly recommend this branch for all storage needs! Thank you so much Jerry!<//review>< pictures>

I wasn’t available to pick up due to working in the city, but he was kind enough to allow my son to pick them up for me. Ray truly made my day! I was having a bad day and he sure made it better for me. It’s always appropriated when there is understanding and human kindness.<//Text><user>106509146869350832888< /user>< Time>

<text>This is a great place to store your personal items. The units and the facilities are keep clean. The staff is friendly, helpful and very knowledgable in their jobs. They are always whiling to help out. I had my items there for a very long time...I know it was over 5 years at least. I like the staff gives you a call to remind you about your payment and the last day for a late fee.
Also, I love the convenience of the gate access. It worked for me with the early hours and late night hours.

If I need storage again this would be  the place.</text>< Pics>

<user_name>Executive Coach Customs< /user_name><Text>Elevator at this facility is ROUTINELY inoperable in the G bldg. Have shown up with sizeable loads more than once only to have the choice of hauling heavy or long items upstairs one at a time or cancelling the trip. Either way is a complete waste of my time.

I spoke to Stephan, who is very helpful. I was able to get a narrow, deep unit that's perfect for my stuff at a reasonable rate during these crowded pandemic times. And I was able to do it all over the phone, with Stephan walking me through the contract and signing online. A happy customer.</text>

Had a great experience getting a storage spot at this location. Kuya Jerry was very helpful, personable, answered all our questions, and managed to get our needs met in a timely fashion, despite the renovations going on on the property. The upgrades to the unit are great! They replaced the old wooden doors with metal ones which feels more secure and gives the overall property a nicer feel.<//text>

The person who worked with me on what storage unit I should rent as well as the logistics of renting it out for my purpose was great. They understood my situation and catered to what I needed. Definitely good customer service!</Review>

Rob was extremely professional and diligent. He called and followed up, when I got to the storage he gave me all information and matched web pricing on the spot. I got an additional storage spot and he walked me there, showed me.Went through document signing and educated me on arbitration. He was so great. I will recommend this facility.<//text>

Stephan was incredibly knowledgeable, friendly and helpful. I was extremely stressed out when I called in and I am so grateful he was the one who answered the phone. His knowledge helped us in securing a space at this facility. He walked us through the entire process with a cheerful and professional attitude. Thank you Stephan for taking the time to listen to and respond to my concerns through the end. If you’re looking to rent a space be sure to ask for Stephan!</Review>

<Text>Rob was very efficient and informative. He took the time to explain every step in the process.

Very easy process to move in and out. Love the online account that lets you set up auto pay. Also loved the staff, they are friendly and accommodating. If you are visiting the location on Doolittle, ask for Stephen, he will not disappoint. He explained everything you don’t want to read and recommended options best suited to your needs. He also drives a Subaru and made me laugh so he’s the best, hands down.<//Review>

5 stars hands down! Best customer service I've gotten all year. The sweetest and cutest one helped me out Lisa I think her name was. I cannot  believe how helpful and efficient she was all while she was asking me about my day.

5 stars for Stephan and Rob today 3-22-21. Even though both were extremely busy moving their office "stuff" because of their office remodel, both were still polite, efficient and professional.

<review>I'm in the process of a move and found a reasonably priced storage unit at Extra Space Storage close by. I was able to complete the entire rental process online and signed my lease within 20 minutes or so. That was amazing!

The next day, my boyfriend and I then had a truly wonderful check-in experience. To start, I received a very nice voicemail from Lisa letting me know that my lease had successfully processed online and my storage unit was ready.

After a long day of work we then headed down to Extra Space Storage on Doolittle and were greeted by Lisa. This is my first time ever renting a storage unit so I didn't know where to start other than letting Lisa know I received a call that my storage unit was ready.

Lisa was really helpful and after setting me up with all the information I'd need, she then offered to personally help us check that my new gate code worked and then she walked us up to the unit so we wouldn't get lost. Lisa showed us how to access the building my unit was in, how to lock up my unit and how to properly use the elevator lift. She was incredibly patient and even shared a nice tip as to how to open the gates via the ExtraSpace storage app. I never have to touch that dial pad again. Yay!

I really appreciate Lisa taking the time to walk me and boyfriend through the entire process and how she was so genuinely sweet and helpful. She really went above and beyond for us and greatly exceeded my expectations. I walked away genuinely grateful for our interaction and would highly recommend visiting Lisa at Extra Space Storage.</review><Date>1611457850986<//Date><Resp>{'time': 1611496097324, 'text': 'Thank you for your 5-star review, Akiko.

<Review>I was delightful to found you online. Very convenient from my workplace and new apartment. I always used storage everytime I move due to job relocation. Had used Public Storage two times and 2 other ones but compared to them, I was happier in your services. I DON'T SEE MOUSE TRAPS anywhere which means to say you have maintained your storage very well. Inside the building on the 2nd floor where my unit was located, it is well-lighted which is motion-sensored. I didn't have to turn a switch and set the timer. It is well-ventilated as well and clean. I felt safe to visit my unit considering I always go alone. Customer service is superb as well. Was her name Veronica (not sure since it's been a year) when I opened my unit? She was very nice and accomodating. With a manager residing on-site, the storage felt more safer. Everyone in the office are very helpful and friendly. I liked you better than the previous storages I used before. Would really come back when needed in the future. Thank you for keeping my belongings for one year! Would highly recommend to family and friends!< /Review>< pictures>

< review>
I rented a place here and was very pleased by the courtesy, service and professionalism of the staff.  They really knew what they were doing, and it all was a very easy and pleasant experience which did not take long at all.  Jerry helped me out, and he knew exactly what he was doing and was very friendly, helpful and right on the ball with everything.  He made it so easy and smooth and had clear and straightforward answers for any questions I had.  I would recommend this place based upon the service I received, and feel good storing my stuff here at this particular location.  I am a very satisfied customer, and have always had good experiences with Extra Space Storage.  Def one of (if not THE) best  big Storage Space chains around the United States.  Thank You</review>

<text>I was a bit frustrated because my storage got broken into two months ago.  I made many attempts to contact the claims company and also supervisor with no reply at all.  I contact the storage company in San Leandro California and spoke to Rob Kuipers.  Rob understood my frustration and maid attempts also voice message to the claims department, I also believe he got additional help from the storage company.  To my surprise the claims company finally emailed me back the same day after his attempts contacting them after 2 months.  I want to give acknowledgment to Rob for his determination and making me a happy satisfied customer.  Thank you very much.

Vanessa, the store manager went out of her way to help me, she was always friendly and dependable.
I used the storage facility in San Leandro,  Ca.
You will be glad too, if you give them a try!

The buildings and storage sites are well-lettered so it was easy to find where we were going, but our site is on the second floor and there is no accessible elevator for people, only goods. My bum knee was not happy.</review>

I have purchased various moving supplies from this store location on Doolittle Drive and I just have to say, the people that work here are amazing.

Cheap storage. Easy access. Variety of sizes. Not much to complain about I suppose. I haven't interacted much with the staff so I don't really have any complaints since I haven't had to reach out for any reason. I like the lifts that the facilities have to take lots of stuff up to the second floor + the dollies that they provide. Gate is secure and requires passcode for entry and exit. I use this because my apartment doesn't have a closet or storage so I needed somewhere to put all my suitcases and random stuff.</review>

<text>Excellent service from Vanessa, her co-worker (his name escapes me), and Jerry the manager.

Reserved 10x20 space online, received confirmation and welcome call less than 24 hours later. I made appt to see it, was driven and shown the space, signed contract and moved in a day later. Staff was friendly, efficient, and kind. They facilitated my move in effortlessly. Facility is huge, clean and well maintained, and I feel safe here during gate hours 7:00 am to 10:00 pm, 7 days a week.

5 stars to staff and facilities at this Extra Space Storage San Leandro!

<review>Needed a storage unit kind of last minute, and Jerry, the site manager, was super prompt with getting everything set up so I could start moving my stuff into the unit the next day. Also, they have done a really good job with COVID to switch to a digital contract. The drive up unit we got was great, made moving our stuff in a breeze! This is the second time i've used extra space storage and will continue to use them in the future.< /review>< Response>

Hello so today my family and I came here to open up a storage facility and we were greeted by jerry . He was very welcoming and explained everything in details . Showed us the storage room that he thought  best fit our needs. Came back into the office and he set us up with a great payment plan and found a cheaper option for us . Just an overall great experience.< /Review>

Was a bit worried about quality considering how affordable they were; but unless you’re planning on living inside the unit, it’s not bad. Definitely the best-priced around the area.

Tips/Advice:
Bring your own heavy-duty lock to save ~$20.
Some form of insurance is needed ~$15.<//text>< pics>

I am totally surprised and satisfied up to this point. I had called alot of different storage facilities before I even got around to Extra Space Storage and was not impressed with the customer service I received. I happened upon E.S.S and the lady (Tina,I believe was her name, I might be wrong) was not only extrodinarily kind and polite but extremely efficient and went above and beyond by not only finding me storage that was close by, but also letting me know that there was a special going on at the moment. Which was great, because with this Pandemic that's going on right now, funds are quite tight. So she got me the special and told me that a guy named Jerry would be my contact at the storage facility. I contacted Jerry and he was Awesome too! He asked me a few questions, then had me send him the information he needed concerning my vehicle, that I wanted to store and got me set up. It was just that fast and easy. It was all terrific, because I found out I had to move my vehicle at the last moment and most other facilities didn't have any space, but E.S.S did. So I went down there and asked for Jerry. He was there, but was on the phone with another client. He waved, smiled and asked if it was alright for Vanessa to take care of my paperwork. Vanessa was just a good as Jerry and Tina. She was very cheerful and accommodating and very polite. She had me in and out of there in less than seven minutes. She took me out, showed me the facility and where I would be parking my Vehicle. The lot was very clean, organized and we'll maintained. She showed me how to enter the gate, I drop off my vehicle and was on my way. So, would I recommend this place to others? Yes I would. I wish other businesses had this type of customer services. They just made everything Super easy. When I left, everyone in the office lifted up there hand and said goodbye. Incredible!

<Text>place looks great on the outside but don’t be fooled by the online “price specials”. I reserved a 7x10 drive up and got a 4x15 which is basically a long closet. Apparently it’s the “same” square footage and if i wanted an actual 7x10 it was almost double the price.. so when i moved house i had to give away my double door refrigerator since it couldn’t fit thru the 2” wide door of the storage unit. definitely misleading and unprofessional.

i called the location at there request to “make things right” but instead the assistant manager told me some excuse about why i was given this particular unit and then proceeded to tell me he is going he only person in the office and has customers waiting to be helped and then hung up on me. Excellent customer service well done....again!</Text>< Response>

Corey was very helpful. Very professional and patience.  Cory showed me three units so I could make the correct decision for my needs. Corey only took a few minutes. The office was clean and they had everything a person would need. I even purchased a lock.

My experience here was outstanding. I needed a storage ASAP and luckily I had found one here at Extra storage, I met the manager Jerry C. The service he provide was quick and smooth! He went out of his way to do what he can so that I can be set! I can definitely highly recommend this place if you need some storage room!<//review>

I'm highly upset that this facility dosent have proper security measures.  Anybody could drive in behind you or follow you out the gate. Now that my items are gone, theres nothing they can do on their end. This storage facility management team needs to conduct an investigation properly because this is someone who either had a storage unit previously or a mutual thing. They knew the door code to get in and these people cut the lock off my unit that I just bought. I thought this would be the safest storage unit and that staff would provide me with best quality service. I'm very frustrated about this whole ordeal, and my unit was not the only one broken into.< /Text>< rating>

Nice storage facility with great prices and friendly helpful people (Jerry and David). I have limited experience using storage facilities and David went the extra mile by being patient and going over everything with me....I had a lot of questions so it's nice to work with people who are very patient. I was showed several units via the golf cart and showed how everything worked ... doors, gates, codes, etc. David even looked at furniture pics in an effort to help decide the best storage size. The facility has climate control units as well, great lifts, and wide walkways to the units. They also provide supplies if needed very well organized. I feel relieved and confident about choosing this facility!< /review>

Randy assisted me this morning with reserving a unit. He was friendly and polite. He showed me the unit and explained all the policies. He was very knowledgeable about the facility and answered all my questions. Randy showed me where and how to work the lift and double checked all my codes worked before seeing me off.

The units and general area were very clean. They seemed well maintained and was pleased to hear there are 2 managers present as it is such a large facitity. I was also pleased to receive the first month rent free.<//Review>

<Review>I needed a storage space and found the one very close to where I was lying at the time.  Graeme was very helpful and friendly and helped us decide what size would best fit our needs.  We were in a jam and needed a space right away since we couldn't find a place to live yet.

That very same day while we were putting things in storage, we found a place to live.  Jerry (I think he's the manager) was able to refund us the cost of the storage unit minus the admin and insurace fee!  That was very considerate of them!  I wasn't sure if they would be able to do that since we just put money down on renting it for a month.  Thank you Jerry!

I would definitely recommend Extra Space Storage unit to others if they are in need of one.  The units are very clean and Graeme was extremely helpful!

<Review>I reserved a storage unit right before I went to bed on Wednesday night and the next morning Jason Shaw confirmed my reservation.  When I went in Jason was very polite very courteous and very informative, and very patient. He showed me the available unit and explained the rates and I was comfortable with the rates ,the unit, as well as the customer service experience I received. Thank u Extra Space Storage for having employees such as Jason Shaw. He's great and I wish their were more super employees around the world like Mr Shaw. He's deserves a manager position because it would be great to have a staff of employees like Mr Shaw. Also Extra Space has the best rates in town. If u want to store your belongings in a clean, safe place with the lowest rates- the place is  Extra Space Storage.<//Review><Gmap_id>0x808f855be50fef27:0x3cab34d72c9a540c< /Gmap_id><UserId.>109637715052676041649< /UserId.>< response>

<Review>Graeme Pittock was our Extra Space Storage representative.  He was thorough and explained each part of the contract to my mother.  This helped her a lot and he gave us a great price for the perfect space we were seeking.  One thing I quickly noticed is how clean the whole area was.  Very well kept and the security is good which gives comfort to our minds.  A five star rating for sure!  I would recommend this Storage place.< /Review>< Rating>

i have had a storage space at this location for a few months now and i must say this is by far the best storage facility i have ever used.  The staff was over the top friendly and was able to cater to my every need.  I had just moved back from out of state and having trouble with my moving company.  The manager worked with me and was very flexible to accommodate the flakiness of the moving company and help me get my stuff into the facility and easy as possible.  Their prices are BY FAR the best for the area as well, some facilities i looked into were priced much higher and their customer service was no where near this one was.  All in all this is an excellent facility for storing your stuff weather it be long or short term!<//text>

I never like to give a review right away, I prefer to see if the great service last beyond the papers being signed. In this case it has.
I chose this location because it is close to my work. And the reviews were good. The unit is clean, also the yard. Well lighted.  Just what I wanted.
A. J.   The service rep was very helpful, knowledgeable. I  was in and out and ready to go in 30 minutes start to finish.<//Review>< pics>

<pictures>None</pictures><review>This is a storage facility worth checking out. I found this place online and called the toll free number and spoke to Matt. He assisted me with renting a unit for my needs on their website. I got a great web rate for the unit. While we were on the call his computer went down, this resulted in my being charged twice for the deposit, but they were happy to credit my account once I provided proof of the mistake.

All of my questions were asked and there is no real catch to the low prices you see online. You do have to get insurance protection for your valuables and it is an additional cost, but probably worth it in the long run. It's for your protection and theirs. As I was getting of the phone with Matt at the call center, I got a call right away from Charlene, who welcomed me aboard and asked if I had additional questions and offered that I come in to take a look at the unit just to be sure it was what I was looking for.

Today, I went in to take care of the financials before I moved in and met Jerry the manager. He is very cool, calm and patient. He drove me around the cute little golf cart to show me the units and space. Place is very very clean, and even though my unit is upstairs, they have a freight elevator (it is working) and a dolly in case you don't have one available. While waiting to finalize my account the power went down twice (not their fault, men were working on the premises) and Jerry just tugged along and thanked me for my patience.

They have some of the best prices around, would be hard to beat them in such a great location in San Leandro and everyone is very friendly and accommodating and they let you know everything you need to know up front. The space is open every day and even late hours should you need to move stuff in or out after 7pm.

I would recommend them to anyone looking for great rates, fast friendly service and a clean, safe area to store your belongings.<//review>< user_name>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>Jerry was incredibly helpful and thorough, taking us to a couple different units to figure out which would work for us, and walking through all the details of storage for a long trip. He also provided lunch recommendations and helped us with the referral we got from a friend. We made the drive out from San Francisco for this storage and it is an amazing value with great service.< /review>< Pics>

Aj was awesome! Followed up with me for weeks when my busy schedule made it so I couldn't come in, scored me an awesome rate on a 3x4 unit that was actually more like 4x5... perfect for my college stuff. He was quick, respectful, clear about costs and even greeted me by name when I walked in!

The facility was clean, well secured and organized nicely. Moving my stuff in was pain-free!<//text>

My experience with ESS was flawless. It was the easiest process to get what I needed. The facility is very-well maintained and secure. Very easy access to my storage locker and to the site itself. I would highly recommend to any and all of my friends.

P.S. Nobody is perfect so only 4 Stars from me. There is always room for improvement.</text>

Me and my friend just rented here a few weeks ago and we made the right choice. They have the cheapest prices around and a very clean facility. We were greeted right away by the staff when we came in the office. They were very friendly and accommodating. Facility looks secure and they have managers that lives on the property. They also have the longest gate hours in the area. Will reccommend this facility.<//text>

<Review>Well, there's really not a day when I don't think about it.  My unit was burglarized and not only did I lose about $10,000 dollars worth of sentimental items,  they also took my "personal" box full of photo albums, and other extremely sentimental items.  When I asked questions about what info they had on the incident, they said they couldn't tell me anything specifically.  All they said is there was video of a car parked at a far end of the compound.  I find it odd that they don't know what code that person used to get access into the place, and that they didn't have any video footage of the car's license plate or video of who might have typed in the gate code.   Honestly, you guys had one job, and you failed. I've been devastated to the point of mental breakdown.  This business should be shut down, and probably investigated for negligence at the very least.< /Review>< Rating>

Somewhat upset at first.  When I first received a quote from Emily over the phone she was very courteous and nice. She said all I needed was $22 to get started on renting a unit. When I got there the office staff (Vanessa) said there was an extra charge for insurance, which I wasn't expecting. I almost went to rent a unit somewhere else, because I don't like the last minute surprise charges. The only reason I ended up renting a unit there is because it was the least initial money I had to put down of all the storage facilities I looked at. If I would have had more money I would have gone somewhere else.</text>

My experience was great when leasing my storage unit at San Leandro Extra Space. I first reserved the unit I felt I wanted online. Vanessa, an associate at the location, soon after followed up with me with a phone call. She helped me understand the different renting options and I ended up changing my reservation to an upstairs unit because the price was more affordable and was just as easy to load up my belongings using a lift. Vanessa was extremely accommodating and professional during the entire process. Once my move day came, she helped finish my transaction with signing the lease agreements and getting me a lock to the storage. It was a quick and efficient. Every thing was made clear to me and I feel like I got a great deal on my storage unit. I was moved in within an hour once I had the space at my disposal. I highly recommend Extra Space San Leandro to anyone getting ready for a move or needing storage!<//text>

My whole experience with this location and it's staff has been wonderful.  I initially made my reservation online for a 5X10 space, thinking that it would be enough for the stuff that I had.  Once I made my reservation online, I immediately received a phone call from the Site Manager, Jerry.  He was very friendly and provided me with all the information I needed.  We discussed what I was going to be storing and determined that I needed a bigger unit.  We set up a time to meet and I was on my way from San Diego.  I did run into a little bit of a snag, but the reps assisted me and I got my unit.
The facility is clean, associates are professional and friendly, and my unit is easily accessible. I think that the location of this facility is great for me, as I am still in transition to finding a new place to live and my things are centrally located. I feel secure knowing that my personal belongings are protected.  The facility is very secure with two gated entrances, security passcodes needed to get in and out of the facility, an onsite manager, and video surveillance.
I can't reiterate it enough, that the staff at this location is great.  Thank you to Jerry and his team.  I recommend this place highly.<//Review>

<Text>We received exemplary assistance by the staff, Graeme Pittock was crucial in helping us in an emergency to place our vehicles.  The whole staff bent over backwards to find a space and coordinate the placement and finish the process.  I can recommend this location whole heartedly for its ease of location and the staff.<//Text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

<text>DO NOT RENT FROM THESE PEOPLE. Our unit was burglarized, thousands of dollars worth of our belongings were STOLEN FROM OUR UNIT. Extra Space, and all of their employees were rude, disrespectful, and completely indifferent to this. They have no security cameras in the buildings, and acted like it was our fault that the unit was broken into. The doors and walls of the indoor facilities are weak - we realized we were able to open our door without even unlocking it!<//text></record></dataset><record>

I went to rent a storage and had an offer i saw through aaa. An employee said it didnt apply and sent me to talk to the manager. The manager tried to get me the offer but could not for valid reason. So the manager Jerry Concepcion went the extra mile and gave me half off the first month when he wasn't required. This storage facility has very good customer service and i have rented with them before. I would recommend if you need storage this is the place to go. Thank You Jerry for great customer service.</text>

I was looking for a storage and I found Extra Space Doolittle and went to their facility. They provide fast service and Tiandra the Sales Associate helped me decide which storage fits my needs the best. She gave us a tour to the facility and was very informative. I finally picked a storage that suits my needs the best today because of the great service they provided especially Tiandra. Thank you Tiandra for helping us out and for the service you provided!<//Text>

Jerry was simply put...amazing!! From the moment i walked in the door he was helpful and knowledgeable! He asked what i was looking for and had me describe what i had for my storage needs! He offered water while we waited no longer than five minutes! He took me and my daughter for a ride in the golf cart and showed me djfferent options! We bith agreed on the 8x12 for what i needed! He told me about the different insurances they offered hours and everything else!
It was awesome to have a fellow rebel (go SLZ rebels) class of 2000 and 2003 meet up!
Thank you so much Jerry!
Thank you for going above and beyond!
Maybe I'll see you at the fields! Go As<//Text>

<Text>I shopped around between Alameda and San Leandro and this is by far the best place. Love the service elevators with the carts; makes moving my heavy boxes to the storage unit so much easier. Also very good security with cameras watching the storage buildings.
The assistant manager who signed us up, AJ Lopes, was very kind and courteous. Gave us all the info we needed, showed us the unit and how everything works from the front gate to the service elevator.
AJ made the whole process very quick and easy, he is definitely really good at his job.
I will definitely be recommending Extra Space Storage to friends needing a storage unit.<//Text>< pics>

AJ is the best as he is very "ABLE"... as in 1) KNOWLEDGEABLE - he is very knowledgeable with the storage center answering all our questions with great detail and expertise; 2) ACCOUNTABLE - AJ realized that there was a mistake with our rental contract during the signing session and fixed it immediately taking full ownership of the issue; and 3) PERSONABLE - AJ is super friendly and treats each customer with great care. He even remembered minor details from our visit 8 weeks before we finally moved in!  We decided to go with Extra Space Storage because of excellent service provided by AJ.
