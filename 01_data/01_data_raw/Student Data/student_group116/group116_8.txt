Great place. Delicious food.  My first time having a Sushi burrito. The one I had was a California roll and shrimp tempura... yummy! I also had the wings.  They were sweet, spicy and crunchy. The portion size are pretty big. I was able to share the other half with my husband. A side of fresh fruit and a cookie. A nice surprise.  I will be returning to this place... it's a must try. I'll have to try a few more dishes in this place before I can give it the full five stars but so far so good!</Text>

I ordered vegan macarons here through DoorDash. The pickup was smooth and quick. The lady was polite and friendly. She was helpful in telling me where to order these macarons from outside of DoorDash, especially since there aren’t many vegan macarons around. I was surprised to see so many bad reviews, so I thought I would write about my positive experience today.< /review>

They have a dedicated vegetarian menu and are sensitive to any sort of dietary restrictions and accommodations you might want to make. They are vegan and vegetarian-friendly!</review>< Pics>

<Review>I’m quite appalled at how I was treated at this establishment today. A bit after 11 AM I approached the entry door, at first it didn’t look like it was open, but then I saw someone inside. I opened the door and asked the women inside if they where open, it sounded like I heard yes, I wasn’t sure but asked again, and she said yes, she then said how can I help you. I saw on the window menu I believe a sparerib dish do you have that. So from then on these are the words she rudely said to me. We don’t have that, and we cant serve you sir, we’re not open, and we are not going to open and we don’t have any times to open. I laid my food from another nearby Resturant on the counter to take a picture of a hard copy menu laying on the counter, she thought I was taking it, she grabbed my food from the counter and wouldn’t give it back. She kept saying, we cant serve you here. Okay, first she says she’s open, then now she not open, then she says I can’t serve you, then she says we don’t have any opening times. Is this how a business should treat customers? look back on previous reviews and you’ll see for yourself. Many customers are not satisfied and have been treated rudely and unfairly. And to top it off she said there was no manager as well. She gave me a name, I don’t believe it’s her real name, but she said Cindy.

I occasionally write reviews for Google and Yelp, and because of my work, I have traveled all over California and I wont hesitate to continue to make the public aware of their complete and total lack of business ethics and unprofessionalism.

Obviously you’ll make your minds up about spending or continuing to spend money at this establishment. I would not trust the food.<//Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOtU7XJUjWmBO9hDan-NwhifwUGcYW-S5Q0NYCQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><Response>{'time': 1553209076769, 'text': 'Hello George,\n\nthank you for the comment.

<review>Restaurant should be judged by two factors: quality of food and quality of service.

Quality of service is terrible.
Delivery was an hour and half late from expected.
The owner at least had a courtesy to call and asked if I wanted to cancelled. However, before I even got to respond the owner hung up... terrible service.

Quality of food is also mediocre at best.

I do not recommend this place at all.</review></record>

This business no longer keeps regular hours for dine-in table service due to overwhelming demand of their catering business.  The lady that I believe owns the restaurant said they can only take non-catering orders from members, but their member list is full.  Too bad, because this place had nice options for those limited to walking distance from work.  I wish Google had a way to clarify their hours aren't open to everyone any more.< /text>

Not more than 10 minutes later, I received a notification that the order had been cancelled without any confirmation. I called the restaurant to find out why the order was cancelled so I could revise the order; however, the woman who answered told me the cancellation was because they were busy and then abruptly hung up on me.</Text><user>100473675056292787446< /user><Time>1570081725293<//Time></record>

Behavior with the customers on phone and delivery with doordash is very slow....Early they marked it as food is ready. After reaching to the restaurant they gave the order after 40min. Customers are not satisfied with the service made by Kopepot. Hire some professional manager and employess</text>

Amazing food. Only problem: Hours on website have been incorrect for months (lists 4pm Saturday), today I came in at 3:10 and was told it's closed. They don't list hours on the building. I live half an hour away, so would really like to have been able to follow my plan I started this morning 😊< /Review>

Went here for a quick lunch cause it looked like a quick lunch place. The food was ok however the people working there were genuinely not interested in doing much. They were almost surprised we wanted to order food. The food took over 30 mins to arrive and everyone got their food at different points of time so at any point there was at least one person staring at others eating</text>

Not a good place to get a burrito. Although the cook did their best, the available ingredients aren't suitable to work with. I did like the fact that it came with chips and salsa, but there are better places nearby. I haven't tried the other food, so maybe other options are tastier.< /Review>

<review>Really good food, with a wide range from sushi to burritos to burgers.

Order at counter to sit down or to go.  Busy at lunch.

Sometimes they are quiet in the afternoons, and only have minimal staff, so I've had them fail to take my order (nobody visible), and one meal was prepared a little sub-par in the evening.  But overall really high quality.

The burger is especially good.

Note: Soda is $3 for a bottle.  Otherwise the price is reasonable.<//review>< date>

The Carne Asada Burrito ($11.95) was fresh-made and filled with plenty of ingredients. The dish included chips and salsa on the side.

The sauce was somewhat mild - not sure if they have options for medium or hot salsa.

On a Tuesday, this location was open into the late afternoon (just past 3pm) for lunch.<//Text>

A lady called me saying the food I ordered on Grubhub sold out. She hurried me to replace with something, and provided some sushi burrito options. But when I asked “how much is the California sushi burrito?” She immediately said to herself, “Okay, California sushi burrito” and hung up.
Delivery was late for 20 minutes. I believe the delay was due to changing order; they were on time before.

Update: Kopepot refunded the price difference a couple of days later, since I changed my order.< /Text>

The staffs at this place are rude. Dont know how to talk to people. Very rude. I went there to pick up food for doordash customers. I got there and asked if the food was ready and she said 10 minutes. And  I said its ready now and she replied 'so' you still have to wait in very rude way. I personally  believe she didnt have to talk that way to me.<//review>

<text>I was stuck in a hotel room and looked for a place to order delivery. I try hard to keep it keto, but it’s usually impossible to do with delivery unless you want wings, and I can only eat so many wings. The menu here is huge, which turned me off. How can a restaurant have sushi, lamb shank, Mexican food and burgers? It was the cheapest with no delivery fee, so I gave it a shot. I was alone in the room and figured I could risk extreme diarrhea.

It wasn’t necessary though - yum! I got the lamb shank and rosemary chicken. Both were fantastic and I suspect it will make a satisfying lunch tomorrow. Even better though - they have cauliflower rice! Really! And it was awesome! I don’t know why more restaurants don’t offer this.

Delivery came early and the messenger was very polite. So - affordable, tasty, keto-friendly, affable and prompt. I’m so glad I found a reprieve from tearing apart another chicken wing like a rabid cavewoman while traveling.<//text>< Resp>

<text>This place tries to do everything (fusion) and does nothing well.  The prices are high, the wait time is high and the food quality is low (plain, lacks taste, like bad home cooking).

Their "shitake lettuce wrap" was 80% boiled soybeans by weight, two pieces of wilted lettuce submerged in a viscous salty oil and then button mushrooms sliced and made soggy. It was inedibly bad. Untrustworthy.<//Text>

<review>I was in a rush with coworkers and I didn't feel like waiting to have a sandwich made at Jersey Mike's so I walked over to see if they had a quicker service to make a sandwich.  But I saw a slice of deluxe and a slice of pepperoni in the heater carousel so I told the guy let me have those two slices please and a medium Coke. When I came out and started eating the deluxe pizza I couldn't stop... I inhaled it literally. The sauce is great. What I liked about the sauce and the toppings was that some places that have their own homemade sauce have too much acidity and after about a slice and a half your tongue starts to I feel that acidity. Not a bad thing and it never stops me from eating more but I did not taste that in this sauce. It was very savory and delicious. Somebody mentioned that they probably don't even skimp on ingredients I believe that because the cheese was just as good. This was just a fluke coincidence that I stopped here I had never had even seen this place and we were in the area.  I really didn't expect this  from two slices of pizza that were sitting in oven carousel I didn't even know how long they had been there. I'm looking forward to going back to see if this was just a fluke or the real deal. I think it's the real deal and I hope they don't change a thing on their pizzas or their sauce...< /review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<Review>I ordered a half-cheese half-pepperoni and i got 2 slices of cheese and 6 slices of pepperoni.When I went to complain,they denied the fact that they had given me ONLY 2 slices. I can’t believe this i would not recommend this place ever and i will not come back.they also gave me attitude when the customer is always right.</Review><GmapID>0x80c2d25de0070b4f:0x900404a4cb000243<//GmapID><user_id>106385380928686434862<//user_id></record>

Local pizzeria that has great pizza! Inside is a little odd, reminds me of a movie set of a pizza place from the 90s. Nonetheless the pizza is great! New York style very foldable. Highly recommend</text>

<Review>Pizza is so good here, the ingredients are fresh you can taste the quality of the pizza. This is the way pizza is suppose taste like, fresh ingredients, sauce and the pizza is just enough. I also tried their chicken fettuccine too, they supply the fettuccine with adequate amount of sauce was it exactly right. Now their cheese bread was something I never had but my 4 year old enjoyed it very much.  I will be coming back for more. Everytime I go, I at least try something new. I can say I'm a satisfied customer.</Review><Rate>5<//Rate>< Pics>

Really good pizza and not pricey.
I would recommend this pizza to everyone. And if you are not sure try a slice, yes they sell by the slice!
They have great deals on family meals too. Chicken wings are great not dry like most places.<//Text>

Their vy the slice pizza us so good and really big! You can get two slices & a huge fountain drink for a little under $6. Their whole pizza has incompletely different taste, still good just different. I prefer the by the slice. Also when ordering takeout I ask them to cut it a certain way & they NEvER DO.</text>

Have always liked their pizza. Paid 11dollars for a small pizza with no toppings. Seems kinda pricey.</text>

<text>lunchtime at 10am not to many places serving lunch.  Seen Valentinos  pizza single sluces sold. The pizza was so good the taste of the sauce in everybite. enouch cheese and pepperonis.  A real Italian place will be inviting my co-workers on our lunch breaks. Small place but cozy.

<text>A quick correction to the info on this Google listing: this is NOT part of the "Valentino's" chain of pizza and buffet restaurants in Nebraska, Iowa, Kansas, etc.  They only have two tables for eating inside, and are really geared for take-out or delivery. Pretty basic little place.

Having said that, the folks are friendly and helpful, their take-out window is super busy around dinner time, and I hear they do make pretty good pizza. We just couldn't wait long enough to try it ourselves, and our group wasn't going to fit here anyway... the web link on Google made us think they had plenty of seating! Oops.

So for the record, their link to the website for the Midwest chain is not correct. As of this review, this restaurant doesn't have its own website.<//text>< pics>

The sauce is great, and the crust has it's touches of crunchy and soft. Giant slices, and great deals on combos.</Review>

Baron is the absolute best at what he does!! There is no one like him. From the moment my friends and  I walked in to his shop (no appointment) he made us aware that he was an appointment based shop but still decided to take us in and made us feel comfortable and welcomed the entire time. Very knowledgeable in what he does. The only down side is that he is located in Cali and  I live in Miami but  I will definitely be back to MonkeyFace for more art.<//Text>

I had such a great experience here. Everything was clean, and organized. I love how comfortable I felt here and am recommending all of my friends to come here. Baron gave me a list to follow after getting my tattoo which I really appreciate. I can’t wait for this tattoo to heal so that I can come back and get another one! Highly recommend coming here. Great details in the work!< /review>

I came here for a tattoo on my arm. Great price! Baron was great conversation. He was really nice and checked in with during the process to make sure I wasn't in any pain. Best tattoo experience so far. I'm coming here for all my tattoos in the future.<//text>

I’m from the San Gabriel valley and everyone knows what a headache LA traffic can be but his work is totally worth the drive I can guarantee that. He takes pride in his work and won’t let you down you won’t regret getting work done here!  Thank you so much Baron for all the great work you continue to do as it’s so hard to find a great tattoo artist!< /review>< Pics>

Although I was super nervous about getting my septum pierced, Baron was patient and able to get me to calm down. Once he got the clamp in my septum was pierced and the jewelry was in just under a minute.</text>

I got a forearm piece done for my first tattoo here and let me tell you, it is amazing! I am thankful for the opportunity to sit down with Mr. Baron Davis, he is such an amazing artist and on top of that an amazing individual. I totally recommend coming in and getting a piece done by this man, because you will not regret it.<//Review>

The owner worked with me and gave me exactly what I wanted. Which was a tattoo dedicated to my daughter that who passed away March of this year. He was very entertaining as he answered each question I asked. I will definitely go back</Text>

I got my first tattoo so that I could have visible scars to match the invisible ones. He custom designed a tattoo for me in remembrance of my deceased family members and it was everything that I imagined it to be.

When he told me that he was lighthanded, I didn't believe that there was such a thing when it came to tattooing. I felt it of course but it wasn't painful despite me getting it on my spine. I'm scheduled for some more work tomorrow (with color!!!) and I'm super stoked.< /Text>< Pictures>

Had my very first tattoo done here and the experience was beyond great. Very clean shop and really good vibes. Baron really sits with you to make sure that the tattoo or piercing he’s giving is exactly what you ask for! I was nervous about it before walking in and was instantly comfortable because he easily engages in conversation. Never a dull moment and my tattoo came out perfect! Will definitely be a faithful customer. :)</Text>

I LOVE my butterfly design he created!  I have gotten so many compliments.  Baron has a very pleasant personality and a great sense of humor.

Love my tattoos. Baron was very helpful  an patient with me getting my 1st and second tattoo in the same session. I decided to change the color last minute and I also had a difficult work schedule however Baron was able to work with me. 10/10 would recommend! Will be back!<//text>

Baron was very precise with the measurements making sure it was even. I was nervous at first since it was my first piercing but I quickly felt comfortable and relaxed once we got to business. The only complaint would be that the earring was put on super tight, but that was understandable since there would’ve been hella blood, I just loosened it up when I got home. Definitely coming back in the future. 👌🏾</Review><Time>1594099553864</Time>< Response>

Happy to have had Sid do my tattoo. He was friendly and accommodating. The amount of detail that went into the work is amazing. He showed me the piece on paper, but went above and beyond with the actual result.< /review>< pictures>

Baron runs a tight ship! He's also got specialized jewellery, and he's the only one around who actually pierces with a hoop! I wish I had known about him years ago!!</Review>

So I came across MFT and decided to give it a shot. Im from NYC and was looking for a place that provided good quality services and MFT  delivered! Baron was very helpful and professional. He genuinely cares about his craft and business. it was my first time getting a tattoo and he made me feel so comfortable! I def. recommend!! Glad to know I  have a spot to come back to whenever I'm out here in LA again!<//Text>

<Text>I was referred to Baron by some good friends who have had work done by him before. We had a consultation which went well and I scheduled an appointment. I needed to reschedule, which was a little difficult, but he took me in on a holiday and once I was seated for my appointment, Baron was nothing but great. The shop is clean, all supplies are sterile and Baron was professional and attentive. I had my ear pierced and I was tattooed by Baron. I am happy with both and I will be back for more!</Text><Date>1568731334869<//Date><Pictures>None</Pictures>< UserId.>

My girlfriend and I were visiting LA for a few days and I got in touch with Baron a week and a half prior to our departure. I sent Baron pictures of what she had in mind and what I had in mind and on the day, Baron was really chill and easy to talk to and is sure to keep you comfortable throughout the process. The space is extremely clean and kept at a very high standard. Tattoo's turned out great and I'll be sure to hit Baron up again for more ink next time next time we are LA. Highly recommend.< /review>

<Review>NUMBER 1 Tattoo Artist! By far one of the best artist I've ever had. He accepted us as walk ins at 8:45pm, he let us know it would be a minute before he got to us so he could finish his other clients. Baron sat down with us for 3 hours getting the custom piece just right and to our liking, he even re-did work when we wanted something new. Great pricing, great work, amazing environment, personality is the best and made the tattooing experience so much more fun.

Very welcoming. 10/10 would recommend. Definitely coming back.

Thanks for the late night and hard work Baron.</Review>< rate>

Baron is the nicest guy and makes you feel completely at ease as soon as you walk in the door. I was the last person he tattooed on the day I went and even after he’d been tattooing for 10 hours, he was so great and put in the same amount of care he did for every other tattoo throughout the day. Highly recommend! You won’t find anyone better!</Text>

I got my first tattoo from Baron here. I had an amazing experience and I was comfortable the whole time. Everything was very clean and organized. He gets right to the point and helps you create an amazing custom design. It has been a week and a half since I’ve got the tattoo and he even contacted me to make sure everything was going well with it. He is a talented artist and I will absolutely be back for more of his art. I recommend him to anyone seeking to get a tattoo.< /review>

<Text>I absolutely love Monkey Face and will continue to go there until I die or less dramatically decide to stop getting tatted. Despite my extreme fear of pain and needles, I love tattoos. Especially when Baron does them! He is amazingly talented (#gifted) and has been tattooing forever and you can tell by his extreme attention to detail and craftsmanship. I can easily go in with a concept and he will help me transform it into the perfect tattoo for me. Not to mention I was having some troubles with a previous piercing I received at a another shop and he helped me disinfect the piercing and make it look and feel beautiful again. He does not overcharge and his prices are very reasonable considering the amazing work that he does. I love this place! Thank you Baron!!<//Text>< pictures>

I was quite embarrassed because I had literally put this man on a pedestal saying how awesome he was. He was very short tempered with them and as my friend said “GROUCHY” granted she was pretty excited about the whole thing and she showed her excitement as she entered the door but you must be aware of people who can’t control there excitement at times. #excitementblower.</Review>< Pictures>

The atmosphere is always excellent, from the great conversations, to the cleanliness of the shop, to the amazing original art that covers the walls, Monkey Face is awesome. Baron is exceptional when it comes to working with you to create an original, one of a kind tattoo design. Plus with the competitive pricing you get here you will never want to go anywhere else.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< gmapID>

Received my first Tattoo a month ago Baron was The most professional person ever. I wanted something small an simple with my parents name. Once the both of us came up with the art work within the next few minutes I had my tattoo. My sister also received her first tattoo from Baron and she loves it. If your looking for a tattoo place it’s Monkey Face. Baron is the Man.<//review>

<Text>Most professional shop out there, Baron, the owner, is a stand up guy who will not steer you wrong. He help me cover up a bad tattoo and put that behind me. Now we are working to create an original piece that we are both really excited about. I've suggested him to everyone that asks, and believe me his superb work gets noticed everywhere. I've a bunch of my family to visit Baron and they love the work he has does for them.</Text>< rating>

<Review>Omg i went in for a cover-up of a bad memory and Baron turned it into a lifetime masterpiece it was more than i wished for . Him and his assistant are very professional, the shop and staff makes you feel like you are getting a tattoo at home. I will recommend anyone that needs a cover-up to see Baron he is a true artist. Thank you Baron for turning a bad memory into a good one.  ☝

I found this shop when I was looking for an artist out here in LA. Baron is such a nice, funny, and wonderful artist! He did my second tattoo and it came out beautifully! He is so great, he even kept his shop open an hour later just to finish my tattoo! I also went back yesterday to get my nostril pierced. It was very quick! I will definitely be going back for more tattoos/piercings. He has very reasonable pricing for such high quality work! I recommend him to anyone wanting tattoos or piercings! The shop's atmosphere is great!!!</Text>

Went to Baron a couple of days ago to get my first tattoo, had a rough idea of what I wanted and left him to design the final idea for me and it’s amazing! Went in the following day to get the tat done and couldn’t be happier. Such a great guy! (My tat was a stags head with a Celtic band around my leg) great detail, definitely recommend!</text>

<review>Was going to get a minimalist tattoo of some mountains in Bozeman after working in Yellowstone for the summer season but tattoo artist previously turned me away for not having an appointment. Decided to try my luck during my one day stopover in LA and the artist at Monkey Face tattoo who saw the design I wanted immediately worked on it and within 15 minutes I was inked! The artist, Baron, was very skilled and it didn’t hurt a single bit, and the tattoo turned out the way I wanted! Thank you so much would totally recommend anyone who’s in the area to check this place out!<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

The artists at Monkey Face care about the customers. From the brainstorming on the tattoo, to the execution of the work, to the thoughtful approach to after care, it's clear that this shop is invested in providing great service.
I recently finished a fantastic black and grey half sleeve and i'm headed back in a week for more work. This is a truly great shop.<//Review>

I came in as a walk-in, and I was immediately greated, I wasn’t really expecting to get a tattoo today, but I was convinced to go for it, I got a small alien tattoo on my index finger, and I honestly thought it was just going to be the black outline because of how small it is, BUT, my artist, Baron surprised me with color, it came out better than I expected. Definitely coming back to get some more work done, and the prices are pretty good for the work you’re getting. Highly recommend!</Review>

Whether you're getting a tattoo or a piercing, this is the place to go. My first tattoo from Baron was so clean and so beautiful, I was excited to get more work done by him. A real professional artist with a fun personality. He has great prices for his work... I wouldn't go anywhere else! Thanks Baron!< /text>

Baron is funny and friendly and an amazing tattoo artist, the price was definitely worth the art. He'll book you quickly and make the whole process painless, well besides the tattoo cause it'll hurt a little.
Definitely recommend getting your tattoo here! I'll be going again!</text><userid>114843380997093364757< /userid></record>

<review>Baron is awesome. Would recommend him to anyone. His laidback demeanor made me feel really comfortable and he works really fast but his work comes out flawless. I went to him to touch up a tattoo gone wrong. He fixed it and is even willing to make updates to it after it heals. I dont need any other tattoo artist, Baron is the dude.</review>< gmapID>

First off, Baron is a DOPE artist that can do ANYTHING you bring him or ask him to design. He provides you with industry aftercare instructions and will provide complimentary touch ups. He is very schedule flexible and is patient with his clients and the pricing is definitely reasonable. Monkey Face Tattoos is a hidden treasure in the heart of Inglewood. I highly recommend him to anyone wanting a tattoo.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

<Text>Incredible Quality, at a Great Business, both my husband and I have now gotten tattoos from Baron.  Years ago my husband was one of his portfolio models for his back piece, and ended up loving it so much he came back for a 3/4 sleeve and a 1/2 sleeve.  After seeing Baron's work every day on him for the last 6 years I knew I was only going to go to Baron for my first and only tattoo.  Was just in last week for the second session.  He is very conscious of skin infections and takes many hygienic precautions to make sure that everything is sterile.  The quality is great, he has a light touch but the ink sets really well.  I would highly recommend Baron.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80c2b65fd29e1f4b:0xda88c44802741eb3</GmapID></record>

It didn't hurt that he kept us laughing the entire time!!! Wonderful experience,  wonderful work and wonderful prices! If I lived here in L.A I would definitely be back.

Baron was so great, me and my girlfriend got tattoos in Roman Numerals of our 4 month olds birthday, he was funny, kind, and very professional he went above and beyond to give us both great pieces, and was so quick as well. It was my first tattoo and i was a little unsure going in, but from the start he was so kind and we just wanted to say thank you Baron and hopefully we will meet one day again if we make it back to LA. You're the best!<//Review>

< Review>
He’s arrogant, and rude. My sister and I called and came to his shop, today. We received consultations and then we WAITED when two other people came in, AFTER us paying customers. He devoted ALL his time to them and made us wait. Then, he had the audacity to try to chastise me in front of them. I told him we had to get back home to our mother. He has a problem with respect and respecting people’s time. The other ppl laughed and talked, not knowing what they wanted. But, me and my sister KNEW what we wanted and was willing to PAY for what we wanted. I would never give him my business. He boasts about being a “black owned” business, but he didn’t treat this MELANIN women right!<//Review>

I LOVE BARON and my tattoo so much. He is an amazing artist and such a laid back funny guy, my nerves went away as soon as I walked in because the environment was so friendly and open. Obsessed with my new tattoo, if I was staying in LA he would be the only tattoo artist I'd ever go to. CHECK HIM OUT you will not regret it!< /Text>

<Text>Went in for a small tattoo last night.  Environment was clean and the vibe was chill.  Once he was done with my tattoo I noticed that it was not straight at all.  He noticed that I was not happy and asked me why. Told him it was not straight and was he not only arguing with me that it was, and after several attempts saying that my arm was crooked, or that I was looking at it wrong or I was positioned wrong. As a tattoo artist it is your job to stencil the tattoo and make sure it is straight before you start tattooing. Not only were you arguing with me you also got Devora involved asking if it was straight. When clearly you knew it was NOT! All you could have done is admitted that you were wrong and be professional about a mistake that will be on my arm forever! An advice tip I would give you is to stop being distracted and pissed off because people are coming in trusting you. I don’t think I should have paid for a tattoo that clearly was not positioned right!<//Text>< Pictures>

<review>I love monkey face tattoos!  Since I moved into Southern California, this is the only shop I will go to.  Baron is an amazing artist and he always makes sure I am both 100% comfortable and 100% happy when I am getting work done.  He even checks back shortly after I've gotten work to make sure that everything is healing up well and that I am pleased with the results.  I don't know too many tattoo artists who do that!  If you're looking for a new shop to get tattooed at, do yourself a favor and check out monkey face tattoos, you won't be disappointed!</review>< pictures>

Baron Davis owner and artist has to be by far the realist business man I’ve come across. About his money and his clients.  First time in Cali on a quick vacation from New York and I’m happy I walked into his shop, i feel right at home here in the Monkey Face Tattoo Shop. Thanks for your time and work.</Text>

This artist ..Mr.Baron Davis is a decent hard and working  individual....the design he created for me and my wife was better than expected....he doesn't see color of skin...but instead he focuses on providing a great atmosphere, and quality conditions that are welcoming...HE'S A REAL DECENT HUMAN BEING.<//text>

<text>I've received over 100 hours of tattoos from Baron Davis and can't express what a talented and professional artist he is!!!  He takes my ideas and transforms them into stunning custom tattoos that are even better than what I was thinking of!  He's on time, comes prepared, friendly and has flexible rates... I love all of the color, scripts, and bloodwash tattoos that I receive; hence why I keep coming back!

This is my home shop! I have been getting work done from the owner Baron for years now! Always in love with the work he does. Easy to work with, takes a lot of time and care with his clients and his art.

I went on a whim to get my septum done.  I did a quick search.  And spotted this place.  I called and asked a few questions. I went the same day.  One.  It didnt hurt.  I teared up alot he  was  so nice/sweet he kept apologizing.  He gave me sea salt and told me it would take a year to heal but a least 4 months before I should change it.  (Safe side) I respected and appreciated  him for that.  I'm think I'm done with piercings and I don't do tats but he would would be my go to person.  ❤❤</Text>

< Review>
I stumbled upon Monkey Face Tattoos & shop owner Baron Davis by accident after deciding to have a sleeve worked on. Upon meeting Baron, I noticed a clean and welcoming lounge area-- complete with some unobstructive music and television on to help with a really relaxed and easygoing environment. Clearly on display is some of his portfolios on display for review in order to showcase his legitimacy and achievements throughout his professional career. While talking to Baron, he acted as a consultant, not a salesperson and really understood what it is I was looking for with an extensive tattoo job. Understanding what it is I was looking for, he took his time and carefully drew a piece reflective of what I was looking for which was a reflection of my heritage. Additionally, rather than rush the extensive job, he broke up the job in several segments over the course of many months. The bottom line is that while he's not cheap in the least bit, the quality of the tattoo job has been second to none, especially in the part of Los Angeles he is based in where tattoo shops are fairly uncommon. Easily one of the best in the city and HIGHLY recommended.<//Review>

Best decision EVER!!!!! I have been wanting to get a tattoo of my deceased brother & deceased 2 year old niece for some time now. After some extensive research l found Monkey Face Tattoos & booked an appointment with Baron. I walked into a welcoming atmosphere, it was CLEAN and VERY well maintained. He was very professional, efficient & answered all my questions.

Both tattoo's came out SOOOOO FREAKIN' AMAZING, two sessions with minimal pain & reasonable pricing. Delay no further l promise you wont be disappointed. I couldnt be happier, thank you Baron.< /text>

Moneyface is most def a place to go for tattoos/piercing. Very comfy environment as well as mr. Baron's jokes topping it off. He's very artistic and knows exactly what he's doing ! I highly recommend this place for those looking for a good place with reasonable prices to go to for a tattoo.< /Review>

(xSolitude)<//name><Review>My wife and I flew in from Denver to catch a concert/celebrate our anniversary. We wanted anniv. tattoos that I drew (sailor jerry style no bigger than 3in x 3in). After getting a ridiculous and outrageous quote from a different shop (Hollywood Stars aka Hollywood Squares) that wanted to completely change my design btw, we came across Monkey Face on google. Saw the great reviews and decided to check them out. Right away we were greeted, unlike that other shop, atmosphere was great, shop was bright/clean. Baron was awesome, gave us a great quote, we were walk-ins and he took us in right away, cleaned up my design without additional charge and the tattoos came out AMAZING! Definitely recommend this shop. They make you feel right at home, clean, professional, friendly, and they accept card if you don't have cash. Will stop by again when we're back in town!< /Review></record></dataset><record>

My cousin and I went here to get our nipples pierced. My cousin had just got a tattoo under her breast the day before by another artist, and he felt the need talk down on her tattoo saying it was crooked and that it was unexceptable, amongst other things. While talking bad about someone else’s work he should of been concentrating on perfecting his own work because my left nipple piercing is crooked. This was not noticed till i was back home in Washington State the following morning because as soon as he was done he covered them with paper towel and tape< /text>

I decided I wanted another tattoo but didn't know where to go. Baron at Monkey Face Tattos was recommended to me by my gf who has gotten countless tattoos done by Baron. I went, told him what I wanted, and he drew it out right there. Not only did I end up leaving with a tattoo but so did my sisters!  Baron was professional, hilarious, and very reasonably priced. He even coaxed us through the process because we were terrified of the pain lol. My experience at Monkey Face was awesome. My sisters and I are trying to decide on our next tattoo now which we're definitely getting done at Monkey Face.<//Text>

<text>When I got my first septum pierced the result was OK but I dealt with it. In the shop, the piercer told me that I could change it a month after. I got it pierced on August 4th, and now it is September 12th when I tried to switch it. When done so, the holes immediately closed after 5 minutes without it. I was devastated; I researched online about it and I was told to keep the septum in for a whole year before switching the jewelry, and I was furious. I talked to him about it and he said that it was my fault on doing so, even when he told me to change it. He said that I can get it re pierced for free, but I have to bring my septum (from August 4th) so he could put it back in. Disgusted, I declined. You're supposed to supply with a new piercing, not a used one. I DO NOT recommend going here, once they mess up the blame is on you.< /text><date>1505259886624< /date>< Gmap_id>

<rating>3< /rating><review>I come here out of pure convince, and the workers here are extremely nice and provide for me an awesome experience ordering sandwiches. But, the sandwiches they make are inconsistent. 1 out of every 3 or 4 sandwiches I order there often come somewhat burnt. It's not inedible, but it's something that I wouldn't eat if I had a choice. (burnt = cancerous).</review>< Resp>

I have to admit I was surprised at how courteous the crew were.  They treat people with respect and create a great atmosphere for being a sandwich shop. We thank you for this and we will be back!< /Text>

<text>Curbside was great. The food was nasty dry not enough cranberry on the sandwich that even requested extra and it was just the worst. The way they make their sandwiches is very poor I wouldn't recommend this location to anybody for a Togo's. Togo's sandwiches need to be beefed up we're in a pandemic people are doing curbside and pick up Uber eats etc step it up guys step it up.<//text><Name>Jennifer Palmer<//Name><Response>None</Response><userid>113929470817926016722</userid>< pictures>

<Review>Ordered a roast beef and Turkey sandwich online and they forgot the part of the roast beef meat. I called and told them and they said it was sitting in the auju and to come get it. I thought I was coming to get a remade sandwich. Nope it was a plastic bag with the roast beef in it. The meat was dry and tough and actually made the sandwich worse. I spent nearly $17 for a sandwich that was dry even tho I ordered different sauces on it and just horrible. Definitely wish I hadn't wasted my money but was hoping for something different and good while moving that wasnt fast food.

Update: I went back today, a week later customer service was great sandwich much better. I did get a different one from last time. Soda machine was giving them trouble but they were really great in helping me get soda that didn't take like bubble water!<//Review></record>

<review>When I go to a fast food place, I don't expect amazing and professionalism. This was a big exception. The owner was the ideal worker: professional, courteous, hard worker, friendly, and family oriented. On top of that, the food was great.

This Togo's location is the filthiest  that I've ever  been to,  since  visiting  hundreds of other  stores .  It was so bad  then I almost walked out  without placing my order .

The kitchen floor is disgusting .  There is a mop that was not in a bucket, just spread across  the kitchen floor, and it was very noticeable,  where that's the first thing you noticed when are you looking across the counter and into the kitchen.. This Togo's should be inspected for Health violations .

When you walk in there's packages and food scraps left on the tables, and when you get to the area to order, the prep station is very unkempt, and disorganized.

However, to my surprise, the sandwich that I ordered was quite good.</Text>

too expensive for food that does not satisfy my expectations from my past recollection of enjoying its overall food. Portions where small, I had to literally go back into store and request that my broccoli and cheddar be filled to the rim and not just half-way.(for what I paid, it should have not tasted like blended up, cold  soup. salad was tasty. overall, too expensive for overall  poor-quality food.< /text>

Horrible service in front of good Togo’s recipes.  Ordered on-line and when arriving 15 minutes later they had not seen the order; front screen not working.  I had already paid, including a tip on-line so said I would be right back and did another errand through farmer’s Market traffic, came back through farmer’s market traffic.  Went in and totally surprised them.  They didn’t have my order even started. Said they didn’t hear me so I guess they assumed I didn’t want the sandwiches I paid for.  Not the first time the service has been marginal, (by that I mean bad), but I am a slow learner.  Please learn from my experience.</text>

Not much to say, pretty much like any Togos , food wise.

YEAH ... it's a good togos, sometimes you wait, gotta learn to call in orders or be patient, knowing the wait is because the grub is rock solid, and lots of people want it, just like we all do :)

#24, #9, etc. ... you know the drill turkey & avacado, beef, pastrami that's usually the way to go at togos, preferably one of each !!!

toasted, with cheese, light on mayo ... light on veggies, no salt (already too much in the meat right?) and start chomping, pretty much all there is to say.

the people are cool ... once they know you, they serve a lot of people, all good i always leave a little tip, thanks for the service !</Text>

<Response>None< /Response><Date>1592007991822<//Date><Text>I tried the cheese foam jasmine tea. It tastes exactly like the jasmine sea salt tea at 85° bakery. It’s pretty good. However, because the cheese foam is less dense than the tea, they don’t really mix well. The cup has a hole on top so it’s not like you can turn the cup upside down and then right side up to mix it. You taste mainly cheese when you’re almost done with the drink,, so it may taste weird. The drink was also not cold. I asked for boba but they didn’t put it in at first.</Text><UserId.>110715076249847329151</UserId.>< rating>

They  have an extended menu but their shaved ice desserts with fruit, green tea ice cream, red bean is my favorite -  cool and refreshing! I like having a little salty snack with my sweet dessert and their popcorn chicken is delicious. Boba drinks are good too but I had better in other places. Nice area to sit for families and there is also a play zone just outside for the kids.<//review>< pictures>

<Text>Yesterday morning, I bought a sweet cream cheese pretzel for my nurse, and a stuffed pizza pretzel for myself. Honestly, they're both great. And our iced coffees were over the top.

I'd also like to give a shout-out to Noe, who was nice enough to help me with my food/drinks. I recommend him and Boba Time, and I hope that they will eventually give Noe a raise! ;-)</Text><UserId.>105091819234118655651<//UserId.>< user_name>

<Text>This place saved my life plenty of times during the summers when I lived across the street from them. I'd shlup over parched as a muthafu, & they'd hit me stat with an IV of some sorta flowery( prolly jazmin) oolong iced tea. Upon regaining consciousness I attempted to read over the menu. Eyes glazed over at its intensity! Hella options, too many perhaps -the millennials have taken over - I steal a glace over my shoulder, luck has me today, as I'm solo in line at this really busy place. I tell the perpetually friendly person at the front that something delicious would really be delicious, so we engage on the various virtues of individual fruits, syrups, gummie sh!t,etc vs. the atheistic appeal of pre picked out topping combinations. Afterwards I felt confident in the shaved iceeier's ability, as well as recommendation. Mango/avocado, with green tea mochi. Marshmallow syrup, passion fruit, green skwiggeliese around the base. Striking color combination, & a well thought out procession of flavors with each descending bite. Yum<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None</response>< GmapID>

< Review>
The taste of rose tea  is bitter , they didn’t crush the ice too even i requested for that agian but the boy said he can’t. There service is worse , i went there yesterday night too they serve like they didn’t want to take anyone’s order. I dont thing so i will go back there.
They have to be nice with their customers And they have to listen their request what they want.< /Review>

Received a very rude service from a male worker because I had forgotten my ticket number. He acted like I had lied to him by embarrassing me with questions. Then he started to lecture me how I should be keeping my receipt etc. I thought I would never go back to that store again.<//text>

I loved this place! We were staying in the motel opposite to the restaurant and stopped by for a quick meal. I ordered the Mini Hard Tacos, Fish taco and French Fries. The order came with two nacho chips with salsa. The chips were BOMB! They were fresh, crisp and so tasty. The hard tacos had a potato filling and came with a kind of cabbage coleslaw. Delicious! We took an order to go and sat by Glass Beach and watched the sunset. All this food for just $16! Such a steal. Highly recommend this place.< /Text>

Such. Great. Food. I mean like really really good Mexican food! Fresh chili rellleno covered in mild sauce. Shrimp quesadilla (sp?) with lots of shrimp AND veggies. Even the beans are delicious! Tiny little hole in the wall. I recommend calling in your order for take out.</Text>

<Text>Amazing, authentic and fresh food with lots of flavor.  It was the perfect meal after a long day.  I ordered a super amigo vegetarian burrito and loved every bite.  My boys cleared their plates of cheese enchiladas with rice and beans. They are picky eaters, so that's saying a lot.
Ask senora ricarda for her special spicy sauce if you can handle some serious heat...< /Text><username>Vandana Kamboj<//username>< user>

DONT JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER! We went there hungry thinking that it was a dive but it wasn't! The customer service was great and so helpful. The food was amazing way better than anything in Grass Valley for sure, paying 3x as much. A must go!!! Very affordable!< /review>

<Review>We are so glad that La Palapa opened up. The menu offers a large selection of very delicious Mexican Food.
We especially love the veggie burrito.
And the HOT salsa is really Hot: a little bit goes well with chips and everything else.
Whenever we are in the area we try to stop in and get some great food< /Review></record>

Tried the Plato (huge), enchiladas (AMAZING sauce), tacos, menudo. Additionally the owner let us sample her homemade Chile/tomatillo sauce. Wow!  Spicy and delicious. Highly recommend this place. Very special.< /Review>< Pics>

This place is a real gem. My girlfriend and I were passing through one night Fort Bragg and were looking for somewhere casual that won’t break the bank and we found exactly that. The staff were super friendly and accommodating considering they were closing within half an hour of us arriving. I had the adabado burrito which was absolutely delicious and bursting with flavour, as was the carnitas rice and beans which my girlfriend had. Complimentary chips and salsa with some excellent beers made for a really great night.

Would love to come back and try everything else on the menu!</review>

Some of the BEST Mexican food I've ever had, and at a great price. Appears family owned and run by very sweet people. The service was fast and wonderful. Their tortilla chips appeared home-made and they alone were incredible. I'm not from the area but I will definitely stop here again the next time we pass through.😋</review>

<review>What a great little place. Don’t expect nothing fancy: it’s just homey food and nice family atmosphere. Ricarda (on the picture) is cooking everyday for her guest this delicious Mexican food. Guacamole is made on the spot, at the moment when you order, so it comes to your table nice and fresh. And tomatillo souse is to die for!! You really shouldn’t miss it!!</review><userid>101599096704628226666</userid></record>

<Name>December Brie</Name><Text>This is an authentic Mexican food restaurant. I'd say mom and pop shop but it's more like a mom shop. It appears that this very nice woman makes all the food. The menu is small This restaurant is small too, as you can imagine. Probably seats 20 ish people. The food is wonderful and spicy. She adds a lot of unique layers to the dishes. Definitely come in and check it out. You won't be disappointed.< /Text><pics>None</pics>< rate>

She’s OPEN again!  Get over here ))

I agree with the many other reviewers that this is a very special place. The woman who runs it cooks everything from scratch and really treat you like a guest in her home when you’re there. The spicy sauce on the chicken tacos is pretty intense. So you may wish to ask for a mild sauce on there instead.   Get ready for a nice home-cooked meal.<//Review>

Stopped here on our way south down the coast.  Just one lady doing everything.  It was amazing!  Just make sure you don’t ask for spicy unless you are ready for spicy, like really, really spicy.  Yum!</Text>

My wife and I were traveling through and stopped to eat and if traveling through again will definitely stop. Wonderful local atmosphere.<//Text>< user_name>

They have the best Mexican food in Fort Bragg and the best owner, ever! Mama Ricardo is the sweetest person in Fort Bragg. You really must visit with her and have a delightful meal and an ice cold beer at the same time! Very casual, you will feel right at home.< /review>

<review>I had a 3 item combo plate and the only thing I enjoyed on there was the chili relleno. I did not like the tamale or the enchilada,the meat was very dry on both. My boyfriend had a Super Burrito and it was yucky. I did enjoy the guacamole on the homemade chips. The lady was very nice to us.< /review>< Pictures>

Great quality, authentic & unpretentious. We love this modest little place! Our favorites are the Amigos burritos. Huge burritos,..with several of the most fabulous sauces we have ever had with Mexican cuisine!! Rich, complex flavors. They've actually become something of an addiction! We like heat and Ricarda will make them as hot as you would like. Easy to get to with plenty of street parking. Very reasonably priced. One of our favorites!< /review>

<Rate>3<//Rate><Review>I talked my family into going. Was so excited for the food. But then it was so spicy i couldn't eat it, and neither could my kids. And course all the other restaurants in the area had closed so we had to get by with snacks for the night. Was a huge bummer. Why make food so spicy you cant taste any of the other flavors like onion and cilantro.

Very good food and very nice people. The only not so great part was the water sitting out. I don’t mind getting my own water but I do mind large pitchers of water exposed to sneezing and other less than appetizing stuff.

Everything but that was great though. My daughter and I enjoyed our food.< /Review>

So good! Mama Ricardo is such a great cook. I had the pleasure of meeting her today. Very kind.

Food portions are large, and very flavorful. Reasonably priced. The homemade chips and salsa was great too! The green hot sauce is some of the best I've tasted.

We will be back!</text>

In my opinion, this establishment is a hidden gem. The food was hands down amazing! We had the burritos which touched the soul, it was so delicious. I highly reccomend this resturant.</Text>

Delicious food at this family operated restaurant.  The super amigo burrito is delicious.  You can have it with any meat or stuffed with a chile verde, a chile relleno, or purely vegetarian.  Mama Ricarda is really nice.</Text>

While on a road trip vacation, momma wanted Mexican, and this was the only place that came up on our Google search... What a find!  Ricarda is amazing, and took special good care of the kids.  She was so sweet.  Oh yeah, and the food was amazing!</review>

< Review>
I was road tripping through the area and saw this place had a bunch of good reviews and a pretty stellar rating. It was a ghost town when I showed up, which for the time of day didnt seem too strange. the place was clean and the woman working that morning greeted us promptly. We got water to start and took a sec to look through the menu, nothing special, just your standard mexican restaurant fare. The woman brought out chips and pico, to start and the chips were horribly over cooked and came in odd shapes that made dipping very difficult as well as having a sort of stale taste to begin with. I ordered the special carnitas nachos with jalepenos added to them and a few chorizo street tacos, my companion ordered a bean and cheese burrito. Let the dissapointment begin...
There were no tantalizing smells of food getting prepared in the kitchen, no clanking of pans or sounds of fresh sausage sizzling, just the unashamed open and close of a microwave door while the woman sat in a stool by the front. When I received my nachos, I couldnt fricken believe it, the cheese sauce looked like yellow baby vommit separating from itself and watery, the carnitas were hard looking and a strange hue of greenish brown with this irridescense to the surface, and she had put whole pickled jalepenos and carrots over the top of them just coating my stale old nightmare nachos in vinegar. The presentation was bad, the taste was horrific and it wasnt even luke warm. After that got to the table I decided it was time to go. I couldnt imagine what the other food would be like if the nachos were ruined so badly. And like I guessed not even the chorizo deserved to be cooked fresh in her mind, she started bringing what looked like poorly cooked(in the first place whenever that was) leftovers and we got the hell outta there, I was shocked and taken by surprise that an establishment could be so terrible, so lifeless that the food would be that way, I felt bad, because she must be on here way out of the biz so I paid but it was almost 40 dollars for the aforementioned slop plus 1 beer and a bottled coke. Just crazy, never again! Dont send your friends or your enemies to Ricardas. Id have rather been punched in the face and saved my 40 bucks than to have burnt it in that dumpster.<//Review>

<Review>I felt like I had dinner at my abuelos!! (Grandparents) literally from the tables/chairs to abuelos themselves! Cozy lil spot, think grandma's kitchen on a family night! I ordered the carnita dinner and a lemonade. Absolutely delicious! Perfectly cooked. Several tortillas and chunks of carnitas rice and beans. Only thing that could have made it better was a little lemon for the carnitas and some cheese on the refried beans. Chips felt like fresh cooked/cut tortillas(so they are thinker and crunchier). Guacamole had fresh garden taste and the salsa served was fresh garden style/taste as well. I'll know how to order it next time cause I will definitely be back!! Great little place and family atmosphere!<//Review>< pictures>

I've only dined here once..  The steak was old and dry.
The sides were OK.. The service was good. The lady seemed miffed thar my friend didn't speak Spanish. I'd have to say there are far better Mexican joints located in the Bragg.</Text>

After a hard day of cycling down the coast, this place was just right.  Home style & authentic, nothing fancy (actually kinda hole in the wall feel) but filled with locals, always a good sign.  Good food, reasonable prices, ok service.  Highly recommended</review>

I first tried one of Ricarda's burritos 20 years ago, shortly after they opened. Since then, it has been the benchmark by which all burritos are measured. I'm not even slightly exaggerating. Go there. You won't be sorry.

The food is awesome, and the people are too. Ricarda will treat you like a lost family member--my brother and I referred to her as "Mama Ricarda".  We moved back to the East Coast a few years ago, but every time we are back in Northern California, a visit to Ricarda's is an essential part of the trip.</text>

The service was really great! Ricarda is the matron of the house and makes sure everything runs right.

The OK rating is honestly just that the flavors were good, but not ahhhmazing...< /Text>

I thought I would give this place a try because it is close to my house. So I went. Got a wet burrito. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't that good either. Not worth 9 bucks. Meh.< /text>

My first stop for lunch in Ft. Bragg. The best rellenos this side of the Pecos. Ricarda is a sweet lady and has become a good friend. The grande burrito is outstanding as are the tamales.

We like to stop at Cowlicks for ice cream after but are usually too full.< /text>

Nice and cosy place. Food was okay. Food was prepared in advance and reheated especially for the price.  I'm from Bay Area so I'm spoiled😊.  The salsa and chips were better< /Review>

Being a Southern Californian latina, and growing up with extensive knowledge with Mexican and Latino foods. I have to say that I'm very disappointed in the pricing and the quality of food that was given to me at Ricardas.
Menudo is $11.00 when it should be $8.00, (it's just broth and tri-tip) flavorless, and you can absolutely tell that it was sitting in a cauldron all day. It was luke-warm when it came to my table. Did not finish it.

The Carné Asada was old, bland and didn't have that fresh off the grill taste or feeling that asada is suppose to have.
I feel like the woman taking my order was taking advantage of the English speakers in her restaurant. Trying to upsale at every moment.

It makes me sad to see Mexican Americans loose pride and dignity in their cultural dishes, just because we are a consumerist country. The employees of Ricardas know that they are a minority in town and any dish will sell.

Don't waste your time here, way better places to eat in Bragg.
Im still dealing with a stomach ache from just soup and two tacos.</Review>

(Translated by Google) Cozy restaurant with very good food, the tacos are spicy and the enchiladas very tasty. The owner, Ricarda, is very kind and endearing, she explained anecdotes about her life and we even took home one of her aprons that we will keep with great esteem. Thank you very much for making Tuesday afternoon a full day! Lucky!

Restaurante acogedor con muy buena comida, los tacos pican un poco y las enchiladas muy sabrosas. La propietaria, Ricarda es muy amable y entrañable, nos explicó anécdotas de su vida e incluso nos llevamos para casa uno de sus delantales que guardaremos con mucha estima. Muchas gracias por hacer la tarde del martes un dia completo! Suerte!</text>

I like Father Chris. He is a wonderful priest and I like going to his masses. Mass is 45 minutes which is just perfect. The choir and musicians are very nice. The congregation and the people that go there are always friendly and warm.<//review>

The prists are all very nice people. It is big and well attended by people in every day mass. The decor is not modern which suits me just fine. It felt peacful within the church.
Good place to talk to god or pray.<//Review>

< Review>
There was ample parking for the mass we attended, though it did not seem like there would be when we arrived. The music was easy enough to follow along though the style wasn't my favorite as I'm more of a traditionalist. There was a diverse crowd of worshipers and the dress code was more 'come as you are' than 'Sunday best'. Parishioners were friendly. There were a lot of families with children, kids who weren't into the mass, and the usual kid noise.</Review>

Typical neighborhood Catholic Church adjacent to an associated parochial Elementary school. Decent in size. On grounds parking is limited, but if the school is not in session there is a separate school lot adjacent to the chapel, and a lot of surrounding neighborhood public street parking.< /Text>

< Review>
I don't really like this school. There is no art programs, snobby rich kids, and no usage of computer technology. People in the work office are using computers more than ever,and I don't want my classmates to fall behind. If I was in charge of this school,I would bring back the computer room and add drawing tablets.
Another thing about this school that annoys me is how cheap it is. They can't hire chefs to cook for the antique show,so they have to use the Lady's Guild instead. I mean if they get 7,000 dollars from each parent,that should be enough money to buy stuff. Think about it like this,if there are 600 kids in St.Chris and each one of their parents gives 7,000  dollars it would be 4,200,000 dollars total. Spend some money instead of making my mom work her butt off.<//Review>

Beautiful view. Short walk. No elevation changes, just some uneven terrain. There is no parking but at least when I went, there was ample street parking.</Review>

<Review>Cute little hike which was not far at all maybe quarter mile to half mile around at most. View was scenic and quiet you can hear the ocean crashing on the beach and see the surfers out if you go at the right time. was slightly windy when I visited but that didn't kill the romance ❤.<//Review>< Pictures>

Scripps Coastal Reserve occupies nearly one thousand acres in La Jolla, California, ranging across a complex landscape including mesa top, coastal canyon and bluff, sandy beach, rocky intertidal, submerged coastal plain and deep submarine canyon. Hundreds of thousands of people visit annually, so environmental awareness is essential for protecting the rare and sensitive habitats and species. There are two distinct parts to the reserve: the shoreline and marine protected area, and the upland area, commonly referred to as the “Knoll” or “Cliffs.” The Reserve is a great landscape to explore and visit whilst on your journey.<//review>

<review>This is one of the great short walks with incredible beauty. Find some nearby parking on the street, nearby. It's easy. Then enter the gate and take a short walk to incredible views and vistas. Truly gorgeous area. See the world how the billionaires see it, and see some beautiful mansions on the cliffs nearby. It's a short walk anybody can take and it's very quick, flat and easy to get to a place where you can see wide open views of beautiful nature. Highly recommend.< /review>< Pics>

<Text>Not a lot here, but beautiful views of ocean from cliffs. If your not from California and you don't get to see the ocean too often, this offers one of many good places to view ocean, very little parking and you have to walk 100 yards.<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

A short little loop where you can see views of the cliffs near the UC San Diego campus. We saw some hawks flying, some paragliders, some lizards. Nice little signs put up to educate you on the area as well. Not a must-see but definitely nice if you're in the area and want a view of the cliffs and huge homes in the area.< /Text>

Amazing views perfect for sunset.  One tip- sign in at the entrance to help justify funding for the reserve.  Also, you can volunteer here which I've done and recommend as well.< /Review>

I'm a regular customer of Jack's and I've been going to get my hair cut for the last 10 years or so. He knows how I want my hair cut and I've never been disappointed. The salon is very clean and nice. His hair cuts only cost $15. I highly recommend Xpect Great Cuts!!!!</review>

I had the best haircut and conversation here. Prices are great and the atmosphere was relaxing. The gentlemen who did my hair was polite and fast. Even recommended a different style that I went with. Im extremely satisfied and highly recommend this place.<//Review>

I have been going to this place regularly throughout my life. Jack gives the best hair cuts, you can trust him to cut your hair well while also informing you of how different cuts will affect the texture of your hair. Sherry does the BEST eyebrows. I always get compliments whenever I get them done from her.</review>

Good place. Nice haircuts and friendly people. The best thing I like is that Sherry would never cut your hair as per what she thinks is good. She will only cut as per whatever you have asked, would never cut even 1/4th inch extra of what you desire. Would ask you and go along slowly. They are very patient people. My husband also goes to same place, he is also happy with their service</review>

0 stars of I could. I had went camping and my hair becme kniytted in the back from not brushing.The rude lady denied fixing my hair for me because to her it would take half hour just to comb and she told me to comb out knots first and then come back to get haircut but I had already called ahead asking them to do that and offered to pay. Soo unprofessional and why would they want to loose money.shouldn't a hair dresser know how to detangle and also have good customer service? No straight up embarrassed me and wasted time and gas money. I think she just wanted to hurry to to go home. And it wasn't clean at all she didn't even clean up the hair from the person before me it was gross.<//Text>

People are one of the greatest , amazing ever best they are and should be known.. every where,and all over they both are amazing hair cutting,and also do extra with hair colors, perms, and eye brows,waxing..so every one should pass on to the next one,and,one and so on... And even driving from out of the area is,and always would and just is worth the long drive extra time and extra little bit of cash but with just How, Amazing,And loving and caring and every thing else your time,money spent is 100% always amazingly, worth it ..plus they treat and make fell and be treated like family Everytime!!!!😍🤩🤩 So Yes this place is one amazing out if this world worth it and worth every penny,,,and your full time thank you to you both Sherrie,and Jack.. for caring like you both do and for loving your job..And all if us for being around all these years and hope many,many more happy years thanks again Marion & my furry babbies doggies,and Joe my boyfriend 👀💖💜💚💛💙❤️💋👁️<//text>

Xpect to get an inexpensive and quick haircut.  Just remember, sometimes you get what you pay for.  I think this is more of a clipper shop.  $15 for a 20 minute haircut (no shampoo).  Not horrible, but, alas, not great either.....<//Review>

<Review>George was wonderful. He gave me an accurate estimate on a platinum resizing and engraving, that was very inexpensive in comparison to other estimates. They were quick and very kind. The ring was a wedding band, it was sized up separated (two separate rings) and it looks perfect. They did an amazing job! I am super, super happy with this work.</Review>< Pics>

I was so impressed by Alec's service at The Kevin Jewelers in El Cajon Parkway Plaza. I was happy to let him handle the negotiations with the finance department and of course he was able to get the chain I wanted at the price I readily agreed upon. Hurry down. There's a sale going on. Everyone was warm and welcoming. I'm very happy with my purchase and the service I received.<//Review>

Again Kevin's came through. For those of you who have not been to Kevin's i would strongly urge you to go and at least check out discount display. I have used this on several occasions and was able to find high quality items for remarkable deals. Husbands you need to look at this display you will not regret this. Move inside and you will again find remarkable deals.<//text>

I’d recommend this store to anyone, and I do all the time!!! Between my boyfriend and I we have purchased 4 pieces of jewelry here, all beautiful and long lasting !!! If you purchase the warranty they will clean it for free whenever you ask them to, and it comes back looking brand new!! Any scratches/ tarnishes, cloudy diamonds, all gone !! I will continue to buy here forever and definitely keep an eye out for their sales because you can get amazing deals all the time. The staff is very helpful in helping you pick exactly what suits your needs, size and personality. Definitely go here!</Text>

I would definitely go back! Cool arrangements for upgrading your purchase in the future. Cool people that make you see your getting the best deal you can get, and isn’t that what it’s really about? Really a good feeling that I made the right purchase from the right place. Thanks again K.J’s!!! 🤙🏼</Review>

What an incredible experience. After ring shopping at a few places and being underwhelmed with huge price tags, I was more than pleasantly surprised with the warm welcoming by Alex, the beautiful rings and outstanding prices. Instead of not loving anything, I was picking between 6 rings I couldn't say no to. Alex was patient, funny and accommodating during the whole experience. It felt like I was there with a friend. I'm so excited to pick up my ring. I will absolutely return for any future jewelry needs.</text>

I walked in to buy my sister some cute diamond earrings for an early Christmas gift. I gave a budge to stay under, and Alec S. was able to help me out and stay in the budget such a friendly person it was like shopping with a friend. He had the patience and helped me decide what deal works better for my pocket, and for what I get. This is my first time shopping at the Parkway Plaza location, seems like a friendly environment. Definitely recommend for first time buyers like my self!< /review>

I’m a repeated customer at Kevins jewelers, and what makes me keep coming back is the fact that they will not stop until they make me happy and get the price I’m looking for. Not to mention, they really take time to get to know me I consider Kevins jewelers a friend of mine I recommend you to give them a chance when you’re looking for jewelry and go to Keven’s jeweler. The sales people are amazing< /Text>

I Love coming into Kelvin’s Jewelers. Everyone is so wonderful and kind. Today I had the pleasure of having Alec take care of a special gift for my daughter. Asked me what my budget was and directed me to exactly what I was looking for. He doesn’t pressure you into buying if it not what you like. Thank you Alec and Kelvin’s Jewelers staff.< /review>

I enjoyed the customer service today! Entering the store had such a good vibe from the workers there. I recommend you going to Alec. He is such a great sales person and has an amazing outgoing personality! He will definitely take care of you and answer any questions you need. If you need any jewelery, come here! I love it, I always come buy my stuff here.</review>

Was shopping for an engagement ring. I had shopped  several other jewelers in the area and was not happy with the experience thus far. I encountered pushy and I’ll informed sales people. My last stop was Kevin’s, and was pleasantly surprised by their knowledge and excellent service. I will recommend them to others I know.<//text>

I bought a beautiful ring for myself as a divorce gift in 2018.  Unfortunately, less than 2 weeks later 2 stones fail out.  Luckily, I found both of them soon after and returned them to store immediately.  Without, question they took them and had the 2 fallen out stones and ring sent out to be restored.   In March of 2020 during Covid19 2 stones fell out again; back to back.  Unfortunately, I was unable to find either.   Having worn a ring on that finger for over 30 years I felt naked without wearing one.   Of, I was embarrassed thinking maybe someone may have knowest my 2 missing stones; Besides, Kevin Jewelers inside store malls had been closed.   After, Kevin Jewelers had reopened I immediately returned my ring and expressed all of the above.  By, this time my ring had been snagged a few times and bent a little around the edge due to missing stones of course.  The jeweler sales person immediately made insinuating accusations about the little dent at the corner of my ring as to why my stones had fallen out.   I, immediately mentioned to him that I had paid perhaps 3or4 Thousand for that ring and merely days after that 2 stones had fallen out and that they had repaired my ring.   He then checked his computer data and wittiness my truth.   He told me that he would send my ring out somewhere and that he would see what they say.  He mentioned that he will let me know in about 6weeks.   I told him to remind whom ever of my negative experience with that same ring only days after purchase.    STILL NAKEDLY WAITING.   I DID ASK FOR A REPLACEMENT UNTIL RETURN OF RING.   I was informed that they don’t accommodate.    WAITING!!!!< /text>

<review>Alec provided a phenomenal service from the moment we approached the location at Parkway Plaza in El Cajon. He has great knowledge and provides the best offers in San Diego. Alec accompanied by George and Mariam really made us feel welcomed and at home with great smiles, enthusiastic and fun personalities. I couldn't be more happier and thankful of finding just what i needed at a great price and service. Thank you for your great service once again, i highly recommend everyone to go and take a look at this great location.</review></record>

Shopping for an engagement ring was stressful. I probably spent a good 45mins taking up George’s time. However, he was patient and I finally decided and made my choice (one of his suggestions). Thanks to him and the other associate who finally rang my undecided self up. Heading back there with the soon to be engaged half to pick out our wedding rings. See you then!<//Review>

Amazing customer service!!! My boyfriend and I recently had the pleasure to meet William form Kevin Jewelers in our El Cajon Location here in Ca. William helped ME pick out the perfect engagement ring for my boyfriend to purchase!! I was unsure of what I wanted and with little description of what I liked William was able to show me rings that were absolutely gorgeous!! Each one William presented me was more beautiful than the first!! I was done looking when William showed me a ring from their Enchanted Collection that was resting in the store window!! Thank you William!!!

I truly recommend Kevin Jewelers because the people there are very friendly, patient, and helpful. Jordan and Sheila helped me get the best deal and the best engagement band for a great price to be honest and they did their best. I really appreciate you guys for being patient and helping me for the past couple of days to get what my girlfriend wanted!!!</review>

Not only do they have great stuff but the deal they gave me was GREAT!! My husband bought me a necklace I just bought jewelry & for sure we will be back. Thanks again Kevin Jewelers!

<text>I choose to go to Kevin Jewelers because they never make me feel pressured to purchase and they’re very accommodating with my budget. Today I found a wedding band slightly out of budget and Sheila was able to call the owner and knock down the price! She’s helped me both times I have shopped there. She’s always so patient and kind! This is the customer service I look for when I shop! Thank you Sheila for helping me find my perfect engagement ring setting and wedding band!</text>< pictures>

<text>I had a great experience. My fiance and I bought a wedding band for me. We were helped by William. He was so nice and made us feel welcome and important from the moment we stepped in the jewelry store. He was on top of his customer service game. I never buy any warranties on anything. He sold me on the lifetime warranty for my ring due to his kindness and knowledge. Great experience. Will definitely be back when I am ready to buy my cuban link white gold necklace.

William is absolutely amazing with such a beautiful personality. He made our experience so much fun and gave us a great deal on our rings along with a couple surprise gifts! I want to 3 other stores and not only did Kevin’s Jewlers have the nicest rings but also for the best price! I have zero complaints and am so happy with our rings! Thank you thank you so much William!< /text>

<review>Alec was such a big help and extremely welcoming. I also loved and appreciated that he included the person that was with me (my sister) in our conversation and had a separate convo meanwhile I filled out papers, not many representatives have that quality in customer service.

<Text>Nothing but OUTSTANDING CUSTOMER SERVICE provided by William here at the Kevin Jewelers located at Parkway Plaza in El Cajon.
From the moment my wife, baby boy and I walked into the store, he greeted us with sincerity and helped us with our purchase but it was the cradle-to-the-grave customer service that really touched my wife and myself because he showed integrity and resiliency in trying to make sure the price was within our budget.  Couldn't THANK YOU enough William,  you are definitely a J.D. POWER and Associates WINNER for Excellence in Customer Service in our book!! If anyone is looking for a jeweler that will help them find some type of jewelry, William is the GO-TO guy for sure! God bless!< /Text>< Rating>

<Text>My husband and I had a very wonderful experience shopping at Kevin Jewelers today. We walked in and Sheila Whelchel welcomed us right away. She listened to my description on what I wanted in a fashion/cocktail ring and new exactly what to show me. Her knowledge of jewelry and service warranty made the purchase of my new cocktail ring an easy transaction. I will come back again to Kevin Jewelers and refer friends and family. I am in love with my new cocktail ring! Thank you Sheila for making my transaction an outstanding experience.< /Text><Gmap_id>0x80d958340c8ac0f3:0xf6c4e9e4e2f75b2c<//Gmap_id><pics>None< /pics>< Date>

I had a fantastic experience coming here. The employees were extremely nice and very helpful in choosing the right ring. I had an amazing time, enjoyed everyone’s company really funny. I told them my price range and worked with me very well and also gave me all the information that I needed to know for my purchase. I highly recommend coming here if either your just looking or if you want to find the perfect ring and enjoy the company of the employees. They also offered a military discount which was tremendously considerate. I recommend coming here and I will come back next time I need to for another ring.< /Review>

I came into the Parkway Plaza location today with a few pieces in mind. Sheila helped me right away. She was extremely knowledgeable and friendly and sold me two pieces of jewelry and a warranty. As a first time fine jewelry customer, Sheila made this a very pleasant experience. I’ll definitely be back to this location!</review>

Alec was super helpful from the gate without making me feel pressured. He  and Maria the Manager got me great pricing with a low down payment and low monthly (including a fantastic warranty with lifetime coverage).

I had visited the Kevin Jewelers in Valley Plaza mall in search of earrings when we were in that area. The lady who was helping us seemed very helpful and at the time seemed as if we were getting an amazing deal. The earrings we chose had a price tag for over $3k however the lady said we can take them for $1k. When we returned home from our trip the same day, I went on the webpage for Kevin jewelers in search of the earrings I purchased and seen they were priced at $700. We left robbed, but did not want to travel another 4hrs to get to the nearest Kevin Jewelers and return them. Never again will we shop there. I’m so glad we were able to find an AMAZING Jeweler in our area who we have been going for all our purchases.< /text>

To clarify, we do not carry the same pieces online as we do in-store so it is impossible that the item you saw in store was the same one online. If you’d like to email our customer service team at cs@kevinjewelers.com our customer service team would be happy to help you identify the piece you saw in store and explain how it is different from the one you may have seen online. While some styles may look similar, they will certainly not be the same. Also, to address your concern regarding our jewelry prices, since we are a jewelry manufacturer, we offer significant savings on jewelry. With branded jewelry, retailers face limitations imposed by the brand. However, with our manufactured jewelry, we do not face such limitations, and as a result, we provide large savings to our customers. We hope you will give us a another opportunity to serve you and prove this to you in person! Thank you.'}</resp><GmapID>0x80d958340c8ac0f3:0xf6c4e9e4e2f75b2c<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I can't begin to describe how wonderful the service (and prices) are here. We had Alec help us pick out a ring for my fiance and he was wonderful. He provided excellent recommendations based on what we wanted in a ring and slowly worked towards a ring that my fiance liked. He even put it off to the side while we went and checked out other stores, but we ultimately came back and purchased one of the ones he showed us.
We had also been to Kevin Jewelers once before, for us both to get our fingers sized and they were awesome that time as well. They didn't really pressure us into anything and let us look around at our own pace.< /review>

I was able to see things there that most stores don't have.  Impressive!    So Bruce went to Maria and she saved the day.  She didn't try to steer my decision, she listen intently and matched my needs.  It was so cute when the three of us took a picture together.  It made me feel like my purchase was a big deal.  It certainly was for me.  Thank you for all that do and being genuinely happy for me.  All the best, Kathleen Wahl< /Review><Date>1530247551134<//Date><rating>5< /rating><pics>None</pics>< Response>

George was truly most helpful.He also gave me a thorough understanding of choosing a diamond,color,clarity and best value.After being disappointed at another jeweler he had his jeweler custom make a ring for me that was far superior in style and value.Dont bother shopping online see George first at Kevin Jewelrs you’ll be glad you did!<//review>

I bought myself the most beautiful pearl ring and my daughter a beautiful gold initial ring from Kevin Jewelers in El Cajon at Parkway Plaza for Christmas. Will and Kelsey were absolutely wonderful and Will even cleaned my beautiful emerald for me. We laughed and it was truly a joyous experience for my daughter and me. But seriously, that pearl ring is fantastic! I got the lifetime warranty and I love it! Thank you Will and Kelsey. Sheri< /Text>

Great store with huge selection. Great prices and very helpful and friendly Employees. They helped me get approved credit. No down payment and very low monthly payments. They aslo helped my wife and I choose specifically what we wanted. My wife and I left very happy and satisfied with our purchase. I would definitively recommend this store to everyone and anyone. Must see for yourself to believe. Thanks to Maria the manager, her employees and everyone at  Kevin Jewelers at the Parkway Plaza location.<//review>

Excellent customer service,  Linda assisted me, greeted as I walked in. Explain to me how the payment plan worked, which in Christmas season it’s better to spend as little as possible. Maria also helped me through the process as well. Excellent customer service.</Text>

<review>I have made several purchases at Kevin's Jewelers in Parkway Plaza in El Cajon Ca. I was given outstanding customer service and I am happy to say that I have been able to build an outstanding relationship with your staff.  When I go into the store they remember me, my purchases and my stories behind my items and what they all mean.  In other words I will continue to  buy all my future jewelry from this wonderful customer service oriented store.

<review>I have finally found the best Jewelry store.  Kevin Jewelers is a family owned business.  I was greeted by George.  George was very helpful, friendly, not pushy at all, and 2nd very good looking man.  (Sorry George but my husband is #1). Lol. They have a beautiful selection of jewelry I could not decide which set of rings I wanted but ended up getting a very beautiful ring for my nieces birthday and what a great deal I got.  The girls were very nice as well.   I will be going back next week for our 30th Anniversary rings.  If you are looking for exceptional quality in jewelry I highly recommend Kevin Jewelers.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>{'time': 1565626045775, 'text': 'Hi Alison, we are delighted that you had such a great experience!

Stopped by with my girlfriend to browse some of the jewelry on display. Alec was very quick to help and had wonderful suggestions. My girlfriend and I were eyeing one ring that he offered to let us try on. It happened to fit her finger perfectly and moments later we walked out both very happy with a rose sapphire and opal ring. Beautiful selection and amazing service!< /review>

Bought some beautiful earrings for my first born as a Christmas present in November of 2017 and 6 months later the little pearl came off. Luckily my wife was there and noticed it when it came off . Toddler plays with her ears a lot I guess . Anyhow she was  able to bring the little pearl to this shop and asked if they could fix it and with out hesitation or question they fixed it . Had it ready in a couple days at no charge !!!!!  Defenetly coming back here when I’m ready to buy more stuff for my loved ones ... thanks guys !!!!</Text>

<Review>This place was amazing when it came to the customer service as well as the beautiful set up that's an eye catcher when passing. I mean I just had to go in and check it out. Alec who assisted me, was amazing and knowledgeable. He made me feel like we've known each other all our lives and the vibe throughout I couldn't get enough of. I will definitely be a reoccurring customer for my future purchases!! Thanks again Alec and Kelsey for making Valentines another special day in my world!!

Great, nonpushy sales approach. Today I was in for a work watch, but not trying to push expemsive items out front makes me want to return when I DO want to drop cash on something.< /text>

< Review>
I have been in the Parkway Plaza store several times.  Everytime I am treated like a friend not just a random customer.  My primary concern is that I purchased a 4 carat diamond bracelet that has broken 2 times in the center of the bracelet. I purchased it in June/July and I am very concerned about it lasting a lifetime.  The joy I had from purchasing the bracelet I dreamed of is now a fear of it breaking again and not only loosing it but being told it is not covered by the lifetime insurance I purchased.  I have purchased many items from your store and recommended others as well. The ongoing issues with my bracelet has left me with deep feelings of regret and fear about my purchases at Kevin's.  The staff has been great but they explained that the store policy is out of  their control.  Great staff,questionable quality of a 4 carat diamond bracelet.< /Review>

I went into the Kevin Jewelers store to repare my wedding band and wanted to ask the store manager for job opportunities, I ended up getting the ring of my dream absolutely beautiful
My experience with the team was fascinating.  The team was amazing and they were very supportive of one another, they helped me and gave me plenty of time to decide.
I'm looking forward to purchasing many more items and I will for sure recommend all of my family and friends to go and visit there.  I like the family feeling and the atmosphere was great!</text>

My sales associate was Vivian, she was really awsome. I came in to their location after going to five other Jewelers in the mall and I told her exactly what I told every other previous sales rep, I'm just looking, thanks!.. she replied, that's fine, I'm here to help! She asked perfect questions, had really good customer service, was very knowledgeable. And their jewelry, earrings, necklaces etc were nice, plus they had a sale, they had really good deals. Overall it was great from start to finish. She didn't pressure me on what I was going to buy and I ended up leaving because I needed to think about it, I got something to eat in the food court, I went back and made a deal. My overall experience was great and I really do recommend Vivian at Kevin's Jewelers in the El Cajon Mall.</Text>

I'm amazed!!! :) I have been looking everywhere for a gold chain... However, I came across Kevin's Jewelry and the very last piece that I saw at the window...was that GOLD chain I been looking for.... I walked in and 2 Lady's named Mary and Kelsey assisted me... And let me tell you... They helped me and made sure to meet my possibilities in my purchase. I am very stoked, I am definitely coming back... Next purchase will be a Rolex!!<//Review>

So i came in the store located in parkway plaza and was looking for a ring for my girlfriend shelly helped me as well as maria and the coffee with 5 shots of expresso helped too. I was greeted right when i walked in amd they remembered me from when i purchased my invicta watch and well i am very pleased with my purchase. I am very happy that they make me feel welcomed and treat me like family. Thank you two for helping me and look forward to do more buissness with you and coffee also< /Review>

All I can say is Alec did an absolute wonderful job in resizing my watch, showing me the different types of Invicta and Movado watched. Clearly, he knew what he was talking about. I would strongly recommend anyone to go see him. Once I decide to get my gold chain, I'll definitely come back here since I trust his judgement.

Also, muna was very helpful in recommending necklaces to my sister. Simply put, both of these two have the best customer service out of any jewlers in Parkway Plaza. I didn't at any time feel like they were trying to swindle me for a bigger commission check. In other words, I appreciated the absolute honestly and integrety that these two individuals showed.< /Text>
