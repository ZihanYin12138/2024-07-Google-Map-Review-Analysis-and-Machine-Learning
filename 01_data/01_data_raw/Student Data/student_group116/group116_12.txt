It was my first time here! I just had the most amazing delicious plant based eggplant parmigiana submarine sandwich! Words can't describe how delicious it really was!!! The breaded eggplant was seasoned to perfection with a delicious thick (not runny) savory marinara sauce on a warm toasted roll. The sandwich was huge! And yes... I eat every last bit! This is a hidden jewel in Lakewood! Extensive menu for takeout!  Must try!👍👍👍👍👍<//review>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Text>Worst customer service. I asked for mushrooms and bell peppers on one of the subs and they flat out refused. I even offered to pay extra for them on the side. They still refused. Then after I posted a complaint on Facebook, they cancelled my order enntirely. I asked if I could speak to the owner to see if we could work this out. I even offered to amend my review. The owner refused to talk with me. Horrible customer service. Just horrible. And over what? A few mushrooms and bell peppers?

Wow, this meal was delicious.  It was delivered hot & freshly made.  Brought back memories of yesteryears when food was homemade and folks cared.  I used to work in a pizza joint, too - so, now I’ve found a place that meets high expectations.

Thank you, ;)<//Review>

We order takeout pasta and salad at least once a month now - the pink sauce is so tasty, and the portions are more than generous. Haven’t had anything so far that hasn’t been tasty and the online ordering is a breeze. Aliacci has become a fast favorite in our house!</Text>

I ordered pasta and a pizza with extra garlic bread on the side the total came out to 40$ and I didn't even get my 15$ pizza. What a rip off. Way to ruin a good Saturday night dinner for two.< /text>

This is a great Italian place stuck in an incongruous nook next to Wendy's. They have terrific favorites such as lasagna, spaghetti w/meatballs, hot and cold subs, sandwiches, and more. Their tomato sauce is the best (next to mine of course), and you must try the Tiramisu. Easy, free online ordering (for pick up). Mangia!</Review>

<Text>My husband ordered their gigantic size aliaci deluxe pizza for delivery sunday evening. First off, the onions were raw and the cheese (along with all the toppings) slid to the left side of the pizza by the time we got it. We attempted to spread the cheese and toppings back out but needless to say, it was a lost cause. We also didnt get parmesian cheese or napkins as requested! We called to complain but the young lady on the phone had us on hold for almost 10 minutes before we decided to hang up. $28.00 dollars down the drain, this is our first and last time ordering from this store.</Text>< pictures>

Ordered almost $100 of family style pasta delivered. We requested plates and utensils because we are staying in a hotel and don't have any. We did not receive any. While the food was delivered within the promised window and was hot, I can't comment on the quality or taste of the food because it's pretty much impossible to eat spaghetti and meatballs and fettuccine alfredo without forks and plates. When I contacted the restaurant they said that they "can't guarantee the availability of plates and utensils." What? At least you could have told me when I ordered. They didn't offer to send any or offer any kind of compensation. Highly disappointing and a total waste of $96</text>

This place is yummy.  Calzone was huge.  I asked for a box the minute it was served because I knew I could finish it all.   Small tables out front for dinning.< /text>

<text>Sorry to say the chicken alfredo was very disappointing. Probably the worst restaurant chicken alfredo I've ever had. Bland, flavorless, and the so-called chicken were then slices of tough chicken meat. Very bad first impression. My first and last visit!< /text><Name>DeShawn Johnson<//Name>< Date>

<text>Food was ok butTristin who answered the phone was rude as hell, I've never had someone say ( oh my God ) to me while taking my orders for asking questions and the manager was no help at all. Would definitely find a better pizza place and there expensive. Thanks Tristin for saying that I can't speak.
But I can write.

<Review>My company ordered from them for an office lunch meeting and we were less than impressed. The food was OK overall if you ordered one of their pasta dishes, but one of the salads that someone ordered was just boring and sad: tons of iceberg lettuce with some tomato, olives and grated parmesan cheese on top. Worse of all, the salad dressing container had burst in transit and it was a complete loss. A bunch of other stuff had leaked as well, so the way they package things for delivery seems inadequate. And speaking of packaging, the plastic lids on containers  for the lasagna and eggplant parmesan were so thin and flimsy that it was actually MELTED into the food--no bueno! I'd gotten the cheese ravioli, and while it wasn't offensive in any way, it was also pretty humdrum. Afterwards we all agreed that we probably won't be ordering from them again.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<review>Had my lashes done here and left very disappointed. I was told they would be able to fill in my gaps but there would be an upcharge. When all was done I still had gaps. Paid the $225 and left. Lashes started falling out almost immediately. After a week of getting bad remarks from people and not liking them I called them back to see if they would fix my lashes, I came back and they "fixed" them but as soon as I walked to my car and looked in the mirror I already had lashes falling out and I still had gaps!! Went somewhere else and got them fixed beautifully. Never going to Blinkbar again. Horrible work!< /review></record>

<Review>This chain is an absolute rip off. They charge significantly more than the average lash extension and their techs are sub par. I ended up with lashes falling out quickly, and during the session the tech glued my eye lids together because glue got stuck to my bottom and top lashes. In no way would I ever reccomended anyone get their lashes done at Blink Bar. Additionally they charged for a full when I received a partial. I would give no stars if it were possible.</Review>< Rate>

The Customer service is horrible. I made an appointment to have 100 percent minks done upon arrival, I was berated and told that wasn’t what I wanted by the receptionist and technician. After 20
minutes of convincing them that I knew what i wanted and a signed release regarding 100 mink results, which basically stated they weren’t responsible for the outcome and would not fix the lashes or refund the $350 even if it looked bad she finally did my eye lashes.

I had to ask her several times to fill In spots that were missing and she complained and referred me
Back to the signed release and begrudgingly did it. To her credit once it was all done they did look good.

I live in both New York and Los Angeles so my second time I had it done at the blink bar in New York —they were friendly and did a great job!

For my third time I was back in LA and I decided to give Sherman Oaks another try,  but when I called to make another appointment they were again very rude!

She refused to make an appointment unless I sent a picture of myself and said I had to pay for a removal and a whole new set because I had another technician do the fill. This seems ridiculous considering it was their company I used in New York.

I would not recommend you use this location. I have another friend who went there who concurs the staff is very rude!</text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>Great quality lashes in a environment. Love the matte silk hybrid lashes because they look so natural; with activelash glue so they stay on no matter what. It's easy to make appointments on their website. Get there early to park.They are open late! This is my go to place for the night before a long work road trip. It's more expensive than other places but worth it. All they do is lashes and they do them well. They also sell their own line of lash care products along with personal care and aromatherapy items.</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<text>This was my first time getting my eyelashes done at this location and let me say I'm definitely coming back. Nora was great she was polite and understood exactly what I was looking for. The whole experience was so relaxing it felt like I was at a spa, she was so gentle on my eyes that I almost took a quick nap lol. It took about an hour and a half and it is worth it. Now I could wake up every morning and not worry on having  to spend more time on putting mascara while a get ready.Thank you Nora!</text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

I refuse to go anywhere else. Blink Bar is ingenious, cost effective, cute, and kind. After 3 years of going every 2-3 weeks I’ve only had one pair of lashes I wasn’t content with about 2 years ago.< /review>

<date>1544298265587</date><Text>I had a really great experience here and would recommend this salon to anyone, especially people getting their lashes done for the first time.  I recently move to Los Angeles and had been long overdue for getting my eyelashes filled.  I called in and was able to get a same day appointment which was amazing because my lashes were in rough shape! I know some salons make a big stink about coming in with others salons lashes but they were incredibly nice.  Someone came out to look at my lashes and  did say I would have to have my previous ones removed ($30 removal fee, my lashes were quite sparse so I found charging me to remove the lashes which took all of 3minutes, was silly and to be honest I probably could have just washed my face again and would  have most come off but oh well).

There are several different kinds of lashes you can choose from.  I went with the synthetic because it was the most affordable. I would say overall I found the full set to be incredibly which is why I would recommend to first timers.  I chose the cat eye style, I did ask for a recommendation and the stylist didn't have much of an opinion so cat eye it is!

They looked amazing when she was done, its been 3 weeks and they are still looking amazing (my lashes usually hold up for quite sometime as I'm really good about not rubbing my eyes and I don't wear eye make up).  Due to the ease of booking, friendliness of everyone in the salon and outcome, I'd give it 5 stars.  Due to being charged $30 to remove a few lashes going to give it an overall 4 stars.  Thank you, BlinkBar for making an out of towner feel welcome!</Text><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80c297cfb8828247:0xb515434d010ffa3<//Gmap_id></record>

< Review>
The Blink Bar has outstanding customer service. From the minute you walk in the door to the second you leave they are making sure you are happy. I went to Jenylyn and she is the absolute best. Her attention and steadiness is amazing. I didn't do the lashes just to have beautiful lashes which they are I did it because my right eye droops and Jenylyn was careful and made my droopy eye lid look amazing. I am hooked on Blink Bar. Thank you all.<//Review>

<Text>Not bad. The customer service is pretty great and efficient, and I do appreciate how informative the staff is and how they treat their customers when giving them information. It's never "no, you're wrong, it's this". It's always, "look at this, and this, and it's this, right? Well this is how that works."
I appreciate a place that can treat me with respect still even if I don't know the answer.< /Text>< Rate>

I had an alternator issue that another O'Reilly's diagnosed, they sent me to this store. They were helpful in buying and returning of the alternator. The alternator wasn't the problem.  Tony and Jose had great customer  service.</text>

Went there to exchange some cans of spray paint. One i had gotten from a friend, and it was just in the same bag. The guy argued and kept asking if i had a receipt  for it, almost refused to give it back to me saying "it looks like the clerk just didnt ring you up for it" i almost had to ask for management to prove my own property was mine. Very rude</Review>

I usually go to my local O'Reilly's but was in the area running a few errands so I went to this one. Bald headed guy gave an attitude when I asked him if they had any manometers... he seemed confused and angry that I asked him a question... Not a place where intelligent people work... No thanks...<//text>

<Text>I've been having trouble starting my truck recently, 3 times in the last week. I'm thinking that the problem is the corroded battery post connections. I stop by the nearest O'Reilly store to buy 2 new battery post connectors. The O'Reilly employee greets me and offers his assistance. I explained to him my problem. He takes me to the area in the store that has the new post connectiors. While I'm deciding which connectors to get he explains to me that he can check the battery, the starter, the alternator, all at no charge to me. I say 'Sounds good. Lets check it out'. The O'Reilly guy checks the alternator and it's good, no charge. Then he checks the starter and its good, no charge. Then he checks the battery and it's sbowing signs of failure, no charge. Then he gave me a written quote for 4 different batteries. Still.....NO CHARGE! WOW, that's what I call great customer service......and I hadn't even bought anything!< /Text></record>

Very nice staff, always very helpful with battery replacements, wiper blade replacements, and car oil purchases. Haven't bought anything else here yet, but I always stop here first for my car needs. They haven't let me down yet!< /Text>

The cashier went above and beyond to help me find parts they dont carry in store and cant order for me. After having the worst experience at the shaw location *never have had a bad experience with oreillys before them* Im glad this store and staff is available.<//Text>

Ida Crawford has been doing our taxes for years, and has always been timely, diligent and thorough.  She is the reason we keep coming back, year after year.  The answer to the following question is based on her being available next tax season.< /Text>

We have always used HR Block for our taxes since we've been able to file. For years we have been filing with MAYTE RAMIREZ and she has always been helpful and had great customer service. She is one of the main reasons we keep coming back to HR Block.<//review>

investment and student loan form filings way too expensive, I'll save considerable money going to just about anyone else. The money is enough to make it worth my time to do it myself.</review>

I prefer working directly w the tax person. Not via phone.  Also over charging us 4 fees almost 400$ this year.  I feel I should have received more $ on my return this year. Especially given both major fires here in butte County and The pandemic.<//Text>

<Text>Stacy Tyler was absolutely wonderful,and really helped me alot. I cannot sing her praises enough. I've been to several different H&R block offices and hands down this was the best. She was so, so, so very helpful, friendly, and patient. I knew I was going to be extra complicated this year, and she handled everything so smoothly. The whole offices was so willing to help me too, everyone was so friendly. I do not write reviews often, but this one was definitely deserved. 10/10 would recommend.<//Text><username>Sierra Green</username>< GmapID>

Made an appointment and didn't have to wait long. Very friendly people. Very professional. I personally love them for their Insurance they provide in the event the evil IRS wants more from you. Have been going to this one for over 5 years. Will Continue too as well.< /Text>

Mary Owen is an excellent tax preparer. We are missionaries and have very complicated taxes. Mary is the first tax person that has consistently been able to get us a refund. I have recommended her to our missionary friends.<//Review>

As a small business owner with lots of questions and help needed, I could not be happier with the service I have received...I was not sure what to expect as I have always done my own taxes and reluctant to let someone else help.  I'm glad my wife set that appointment and I got that help!  Thank you Sue!< /text>

I used to really like the one that was in the Pismo Beach outlets the store in Santa Maria is so so my problem is with customer service and online ordering I have never had a issue before till now I order 3 jackets online I'm pretty sure the price was a glitch and they cancel my order I called them they said it was because my payment did not go through so I called pay pal they said it was pending and they haven't pulled the money but it was there so I call them back and I told them I think you don't wanna honor the price they said no it's not that just give us another credit card and we will do the transaction again at the same price so I did and she said everything was OK and 2 hours later again an email stating that the order was canceled when it is showing pending on my credit card statement  I also called them and they said the funds were available this is ridiculous I'm going to call them again and see what excuses they give me. OK so I just called them they said now that the items are no longer in stock and that  It's a glitch because I also told them now it's showing  on their website that the jackets are $26.99 not $12 she then said they are trying to fix the problem but unfortunately they no longer had the items that even if I ordered them at $26.99 that the order would be canceled she is full of it so I just hung up on her</Review>

<text>My first experience was great here. I went in for a couple of t-shirts for my work uniform and Carlos, the manager, directed me to all there options as soon as I walked in. Found the best deals and learned how to read there sale signs. Well definitely go in again.< /text>< Pictures>

I will not come shopping here for meat ever again.
My husband bought chicken and got home and froze it when when i unfroze it everything looked good i washed well until i was making it. It started smelling funky when the chicken was ready i decided to smell it since the weird smell was coming from the chicken and guess what chicken was spoiled it didnt work !!!!! i tasted to make sure and yeah they gave us spoiled chicken .</Text>

I work close to this place so a couple of times a month I go get a burrito. Simply The Best! Made right in front of you. Huge burrito. Two meals for most people. Very tasty. Plenty of meat. You will be satisfied. Only $6.00.
Nice people, great prices.< /Text>

They have a great variety of drinks, snacks, & some househould necessities; fresh looking fruit/veggies, as well as a very impressive selection of dried chiles, carne, & liquor. All of the above/excellent customer service + good prices make this my convenience store of choice for the neighborhood.< /Review>

I have taken several classes in Yoga and different styles of Tai Chi and Qi Gong, but this is the first time that the emphasis has been consistently on amplifying the feeling of energy in the body.  As a person who has been at odds with my own body throughout my adult life due to disordered eating for emotional reasons, I am finding that the focus on feeling the energy in the body has enabled me to think more kindly about my physical body and to revel in moving it, rather than having to force myself to exercise.  In less than a month, by taking an average of 3 classes or more per week, I am already feeling stronger, my feet are hurting less, and I look forward to classes as often as I can!<//Text>

This center is like an energy vortex. I’ve been taking classes for about 3 months. So far my stress has decreased, my sleep quality has increased and I’m more balanced and grounded throughout my day.  As soon as I walk in, my mind and body relax.  I’m so grateful for the teachers and their healing energy and for the welcoming members. Such a special place!</Text>

Since I began to enjoy the services of Body & Brain Yoga Tai Chi, I have realized that modern life had separated me from my being and the intimate relationship between my body and my brain. Now I feel a better conection between them and my life has become calmer and the depression has diminished. Hopping to be better and better.            Thanks to all instructors for their quality, professionalism and for your LOVE.< /Review>

From the moment I walked in, I felt truly welcomed.   They took the time to listen to my questions, my concerns and gave me a wealth of information that made sense to me.  After my first session, I felt and notice the mental and health value it gave me. I highly recommend it, you will not be disappointed!!< /text>

Dahn Yoga has been the one of the best investments I've put into myself.  Originally I was just looking for a yoga studio close to home, but I found so much more here!  There are plenty of stretches and exercises for flexibility as well as different techniques to strengthen your core.  The guided meditation they have has opened my eyes as well as my heart to so much more.  The instructors as well all of the members are so nice there which help to create an even richer experience all in itself.

Simply put, if you try it you will love it.  So try it!</Text>

I hope to see you in class soon!'}< /Resp><rate>5</rate><Review>I became a member of the body & brain center in Torrance about 2 years ago. Over the past 20 years I have tried all kinds of different yoga practices & always injoyed  my experiences & the way it made me feel, energized,flexible & toned however it always became the same old routine & then a chore to attend. I needed something more and after a long break from practice & several personal life changing experiences I needed to get my life back. I have always taken care of people, growing up with a disabled mother an a sister with chronic illness raising a family & my work as a Nurse, it was time to take care of myself I was at burn out & finding it hard to take care of others as I had always done. Instinctively I knew I needed to return to yoga classes as it made me feel good, I did a google surch for classes in my local area & Body & Brain Torrance came up, Idecided to give their open house the following Saturday a try, from the moment I stepped in the center & spoke to the very welcoming person at the door it felt like a sanctuary a safe friendly supportive environment. This place not only takes care of my physical wellbeing but my mental wellbeing it is so much more than a yoga or Tai Chi center, the staff are dedicated to helping you become physically & mentally at peace with yourself. There is a variety of different sessions so no need to feel you get in a rut of the same old routine. I have learned & gained so much from this place I am physically & mentally stronger than I would have ever thought possible. At the time of unprecedented chaos the center has started on line classes of course it's not like being at the center but it is fabulous to be able to continue practice from home with the support & encouragement of the Masters & other class members. If you are considering checking out this place or even starting with the on line classes I can not recommend this place enough, you will not be disappointed. Please give it a try we always welcome seeing new members weather it be online at the moment or in class in the future. Stay healthy, be strong & look for the peace in your self.

<Text>I viewed the video on the performance of Chris and participants from this center and I  am very impressed because it was very organized. The flow is very smooth and the exercises are combination of traditional tai chi, contemporary moves and martial arts. Chris introduced these exercises in one of our sessions in this center and I am very honored to be in that class. I am a beginner having only been a member for three months but with the caliber of this instructor  teaching us, I know I will have a healthy body, happy mind and power brain.<//Text><pics>None< /pics><resp>{'time': 1612648603819, 'text': 'Thank you Adel!

<review>I found inner peace and transformation at Dahn Yoga Torrance. I was able to open up my body and understand the relationship it had with my brain. I not only learned about energy and how to use it to heal myself and others around me, but I also gained so many valuable principles that I will carry with me for the rest of my life. I really enjoy the cozy family atmosphere here along with the energy of all of the instructors and members who really support awakening to changes.

I found healing. I found value. I found myself.

My sincerest gratitude and admiration to the dedicated and devoted at Dahn Yoga Torrance. Thank you for creating such a blessed environment for me to learn and grow. Always.<//review>< Pictures>

I started with Dahn Yoga by a friend's recommendation and couldn't be more happy.  I started feeling more relaxed and had more energy right away and after only three weeks, I can tell a difference in my body.   I have a long way to go before I feel all the benefits of the class, but am so glad I was told about Dahn Yoga.  Everyone at Dahn is very friendly and very helpful. :-)</text>

I absolutely love Body and Brain Yoga Tai Chi! From the very first trial class until now, I always feel so good after taking class. Even if I walk in feeling stiff and tired, by the time class is over, I feel revitalized and filled with energy! I took a workshop at this location, and through this workshop I got to experience the power I had inside, strength that I never even knew existed! It was amazing!! I highly recommend this place!<//text>

I feel so lucky to have found this center! There is so much respect and kindness among the masters and the members. It is not traditional yoga, but a special flowing style that provides deep stretching, energy movements, and even some cardio. Perfect for anyone, especially someone older (like me). I love that the instructors understand our body's meridians and chakras, and help focus on the parts of our body the need healing. I've also lost weight and become much stronger.<//review>

Great holistic yoga. I still love going to classes- even after 5 years. Exercises are simple to follow, but great in effect. I learn something new about my body and mind every time I go. My overall well-being has changed significantly and I feel a lot happier. I have learned to breathe more deeply and so get less stressed and sleep better, I am able to meditate on my own to meet daily challenges and I feel a lot stronger as a person.
This is a form of exercise that- for the first time in my life- does not get boring to me.<//text>

<Text>Before I never paid any attention to myself. It was always about others.  After coming to Dahn Yoga Torrance center, I feel more connected to myself and I feel more grounded.  Now I am paying attention to myself. I feel very peaceful and happy. I know there is more for me to grow and to change, but I am happy to have a center to go to so I can do this.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><gmap_id>0x80dd4b214541053f:0x3f7c292cd7386847<//gmap_id><date>1385494688001< /date>< UserId.>

The best investment I ever made in myself.The yoga is healing, leaving me more flexible and pain free. The meditation quiets my mind and allows me be focused in the present and the energy work is amazingly blissful. The instructors are dedicated to their craft and the studio welcoming and serene.

<Text>Amazing though less surprising to see Chris (one of our instructor in Body and Brain training studio in Torrance) executing various Meridian exercises in one Masterpiece of work which lasted in 4 minutes. Truthfully and as a beginner, I have seen his moves and others on the stage show before in bit and pieces during our exercise sessions with him every week. It was amazing to see when the pieces of the puzzle was put together in one variation with such ease of strength and gracefully performed. It really made my senior’s years glowing with enthusiasm for years to come.< /Text>< rating>

I just joined Dahn Yoga a week and a half ago, and I am already experiencing profound changes in my body and mind. I had been experiencing a lot of stress over the past few months that resulted in my entire body being achy and sore, but after one intro class and one basic yoga class, my pain was drastically reduced and after one week of classes, I am pain free and more flexible than I have been in years! My mindset is also calmer and focused, and I just feel much happier overall, despite my life stressors remaining the same. Master Choi has such a joyful and supportive presence, and all the staff and members have been so welcoming. I highly recommend Dahn Yoga, and I look forward to experiencing where this healthful practice takes my mind, body, and soul.<//review>

<text>I have been practicing Dahn Yoga in the Torrance Center for two months. Because of my work schedule and family commitments I can usually only go to class two, maybe three times per week. Even with that limited exposure to the Dahn Yoga experience, I am feeling so much better physically, mentally and emotionally. I feel centered and more confident. I feel a lightness in my body and I am learning to keep stress from  becoming overwhelming. I always leave the class feeling refreshed, energized and  positive, no matter how I felt when I arrived. Master Choi and all of the teachers are patient, caring and do not judge. They are there to help. I like the challenging physical work and also the connection that is strengthened between the body and life energy. I am so happy I am a member!< /text>< pictures>

I did not know what to expect when I came to my first class, especially since I had never done tai chi before. I'm sure I was a bit nervous before, but once I set foot in the studio I melted. The class hadn't even started yet and I felt peace! Chris was the instructor that day, his warmth and energy made me feel even more at home. By the end of my first class I felt a deep peace that I had not experienced in all my years of yoga at other studios.

Now that I have been going to more classes I realize that this is not just any other yoga or tai chi studio. This is the real deal. No frills. They believe that everyone can heal and feel energy through patience and hard work. Also the tea ceremonies at the end of every class are beautiful! I don't know what they put in their tea but it is delicious.

I have so enjoyed getting to know the members, many of whom have been coming for years, and all the wonderful instructors. Their dedication, ease, and joy are inspiring. The classes have helped me grow in more ways than one.

Basically, become a member. You won't regret it!</Review>

Before Dahn Yoga I was suffering from arthritis in my knees.  The doctor suggested that I have surgery done.  At that time my daughter was a member and asked me to try out Dahn Yoga.  After just two months of going to class the pain in my knees became less and less until it completely disappeared and I never ended up having the surgery done.  Until today I have no pain in my knees!  I am so grateful to Dahn and their instructors for helping me to learn how to heal my condition.<//Review>

I have been a member of Dawn yoga Torrance, Ca, for about 3 years.
I started when my wife Donna said that I should take the introductory offer that Dahn yoga offered.
At the time I started Dahn I was seeing a chiropractor for spinal stenosis, (back pain) since then I have not needed chiropractic care, for this condition.
Much of the Dahn yoga sessions benefits Core strength, and keeping muscles relaxed and stretched. This has helped me in staying limber and flexible; other benefits include relaxing and enhancement to the brain.
I find I don’t drive as fast, or follow as close, and I don’t need to get upset when I get cut off while driving.   Dahn yoga helps keep peace of mind and a higher level of consciousness for me.
The instructors are really great!
The instructors work with all individuals issues in a very caring and understanding, knowledgeable way.<//text>

At the urging of a friend, I reluctantly attended a Dahn Yoga open class. I had already tried so many treatments and practices, I had lost hope to ever come out of the distressful fatigue I've grown to accept as my "normal" state of being.
At the Dahn open class, I immediately felt there was something different. The exercises were gentle and enjoyable, supported by perfectly suited music. During the class, quiet moments were dedicated to make us aware of our body and calm our busy mind. At the end of the class I was feeling good in my body and rested in my mind. I signed up for a year membership.
After 3 weeks, I was already feeling the effects! I was able to go through the day without dragging, for the first time in years. Soon after, I recovered a body condition I didn't remember existed. I was "alive"!! My fatigue had vanished.  My spirit had lifted. I started enjoying going out with my friends. I had a life again!
As my Dahn practice progressed, other ailments went away: my body was no longer sore, the persistent buzzing in my ear lowered by 70%, the nagging ache of my lower back disappeared, and my lower jaw that had been slightly shifted realigned properly before I even noticed.
Dahn also teaches proper breathing, I was made aware of breathing more fully throughout the day. This contributed considerably in lowering my anxiety.
Soon I realized that the practice of Dahn Yoga was not only helping me master my body but was also working at a deeper level. I became more aware of which habits were detrimental to my well-being, and worked at taming them down while acquiring good habits.
I find myself much happier nowadays.  Dahn Yoga has shown me the way to heal not only my body but also my mind. It has put me back in charge of my life. Its practice will be forever integrated into my life. I owe my Dahn instructors a debt of gratitude for teaching me the best practice there is for developing Health and Happiness !! <<< /review>

<Text>I’ve been going to Dahn Yoga for over a year now.  If you are looking for more fulfillment and meaning to your life, then Dahn Yoga can help you achieve that thru exercise.  It is not an ordinary yoga center.  They offer life-changing events that will help you connect your body with your mind and soul.  It helps reduce the stress of managing Life’s ups and downs.  I’ve taken many other yoga classes during the last 30 years and Dahn Yoga is the only center that offers these life-changing classes.  My search is over.  You are always welcomed there with genuine sincerity and get individual attention/training.<//Text>< pictures>

I have been joint Body Brain Yoga Tai Chi for two and half years, such an incredible experience that I have, I wanted share with you, I used to have back and neck pain for many years, once week I have to go to see chiropractor, it really bothers me daily activity, couple years ago I went to the restaurant for lunch the body and brain yoga just next door so after lunch I walk in and a very nice lady was there give me the schedule tell me to try it, I said OK, then I am in, until today that's the best thing I did for my life, now I am happier and healthier, and I don’t have to go see chiropractor every week,  I go to class almost every day, loving it, such great place to be, thank you Shinaram, and thank you Chris.</review>

Love it!!! I have anxiety and have tried basically everything except medication to try to cope with it and this is the only thing that really works. I feel like i have an open mind and i have learned to live and cope with my anxiety. I recommend body & brain to anyone that is either looking for a way to cope with stress or anxiety! You won’t regret it :)<//Review>

<text>I want to share a wonderful experience that I had at the Torrance Dawn Yoga Center.Some time ago my right shoulder started to really bother me. It had hurt for months but through some gentle and fun exercises that I learned at Dawn Yoga I am now completely pain free. I was amazed.

I highly recommend that you call Torrance Dawn Yoga today. It will be one of the best decisions that you will ever make. You can ask for Master Choi. She knows so much about how to live happily with lots of energy. She really cares and she can really help you.< /text>< Pics>

I have been a member of Dahn Yoga for almost 3 months. I have had many positive results I was being treated by a Chiropractor and Acupuncturist for severe shoulder, neck and back problems.  I no longer have those problems with daily stretching and the tools that Instructors have provided me I am no longer in pain.  The Instructors spend time and work with all there students on a personal basis.  Dahn Yoga has really changed my life I am no longer in pain and my anxiety levels are much lower.  I wish I would have discovered Dahn Yoga earlier in my life as it as greatly improved my health and wellbeing.

Body & Brain changed me and my life.  It might sound I am streching a story though.  It is not just an exercise for me.  My body and mind is now connected.  I feel comfortable about myself and like myself more than ever!   All the instructors are amazing and will be there for me always.  My allergies, frequent inflamtions, adorenal fatigue and sciatic nerve pain are much better now!  This is the best place for everybody!< /text>

I had suffered from bouts of depression and anxiety for how many years now, and I have seeked helped from psychologists and psychiatrists whenever they'd gotten worse, but of course the experiences still had its effects on my well-being. Before I knew it, my thoughts and feelings had been tainted by so much negativity that I couldn't appreciate life anymore.

When I tried out Body & Brain's yoga and tai chi, I noticed so many things about myself that I chose to ignore both physically and emotionally. There were tiny changes at first, but when I attended their Finding True Self program, my whole entire outlook of the world and myself changed. I suddenly didn't feel the need to hate anymore. My heart used to feel so heavy and I used to be so tired and sad, now it's the exact opposite. I can no longer empathize with the negative thoughts I had. My heart feels lighter and more open to the people around me. I can no longer say I am lost. Now I am able to sincerely say I want to live, and that is what has been keeping me motivated into looking forward to every single day no matter the hardship.

I am thankful to everyone in the Body & Brain Center for helping me find myself and the peace I needed to keep on going. I highly recommend Body & Brain to anyone and everyone no matter their backgrounds, goals and aspirations. I have learned so much from just a few months of classes and just one program and I am looking forward to more. I'm sure everyone can definitely experience the same wonderful journey I've had!< /Text>

<username>Ngamako Patara< /username><pics>None<//pics><review>I have been here at Body & Brain Yoga & Tai Chi for 3years.  It is the best investment I have made for myself. How did this come about? A flyer in my mail box. 1st one I threw away.  Too busy. Then a 2nd came."Hmmm, Nah! Never mind. Threw that one away too. Few months went by and here
comes another one. I threw it in a draw. Maybe, just maybe they stop bothering me. The draw is used for various things. Every time I open the draw there is the Flyer. I decided to visit Body/Brain Torrance center Mar/April 2014 I have learnt sooooo much about myself, my body and me. Amazed at the personal attention the Masters give to us members.
Everything you do here is important for soul, mind, body. Mindufulness is a very powerful thing and my meditation skills have gotten better. Learning also to give negative thoughts the boot. I give thanks to all the masters for their guidance and patience.  Looking forward to many more years to come.<//review>< Resp>

I was taught that we must spread the good news and share the blessings we receive to others...It has been only a week, and please, notice this, ONLY A WEEK since I enrolled myself at Dahn Yoga in Torrance. From the very first initial session I had, positive changes said "present!". I found the relief to a pain in my shoulder/arm/hand due to a chronic tendonitis I had suffered for years which it was reducing the freedom of movement, while causing pain, in that part of my body...I have found a constant, steady state on my emotions no matter the stressful/challenging situations I can face in my everyday: calm at all times! Not easy to find, huh?!...I am a person who tends to increase my consumption of food when anxiety appears: this has gone! YES, the exact way you are reading it here! The "NEED" of eating food in quantity and quality has been automatically modified! It is simply awesome, and I am totally grateful for this, as well!
I am looking forward for what it is coming next while experiencing the enjoyment and well being every single class provides me.
Finding yourself, peace of mind, health, and to stay fit, all at the same time!...Does it not sound appealing to you?!...Thank you very much Dahn Yoga Torrance.</Text>

<text>I've been with dahn yoga for almost two and a half years.  dahn yoga incorporates a wide variety of mind - body exercises.  it helps me develop greater awareness and sensitivity to the well-being of my body.

through the years that I've been engaged in the trainings and exercises, it help me understand and accept myself and feel comfortable with who I am.  at first, it was not easy for me.  it  was a challenge for me to get in touch with my real feelings.  it takes honesty and diligence  to examine my attitudes towards life in order to discover which ones are dysfunctional.  have to be open-minded.

health wise, I have a  hypertension problem for more than 15 years.  I've been taking medicines since then.  the medicines didn't help at all in lowering my blood pressure. without telling my doctor,  I stopped taking medicines after a week of joining yoga because  any medicines that I take have a negative effect on me.   i believed that through yoga i'll be able to lower my blood pressure because the problem was on me.  I worry and think too much which  made me emotionally imbalance.  my mind was the source of my health problem.  Practicing yoga is a powerful tool for clearing my mind and freeing me from my mood swings.  the outcome - my blood pressure is back to normal after 15 years.

i noticed too that practicing yoga relaxes not just my mind but also my body. releasing stress and tensions gives me more energy -  the energy that enables me to deal efficiently with the challenges at work.  I gained self-confidence and was able to control my emotions.  I learned how to manage and cope up with stress. I find myself calm, patient and with a quiet mind.

through my experiences, i may say that each training is an exercise in self observation.  have to be aware and listen to what my body is telling me.  doing the training regularly and diligently strengthen one's character and makes it more enjoyable and beneficial.  it helps to outgrow useless attitudes and negative thoughts.  it is liberating.  it get me in touch with my true nature, giving me a sense of fulfillment, inner worth and confidence.  it builds my willpower and put me in charge of my own life.

for all the benefits that i got from dahn yoga, let me thank Sunshimnim, Master Ryan, Choi Wonjangnim and Sabumnims for their untiring help and support.<//text>< time>

He let me read the ingredients on the bottle to confirm that I was okay with them. When it was time to pay I was simply informed of the perks of a membership but I wasn't pressured to sign up for one. There was a small issue with my gift card not showing up in the system but the receptionist did not panic we were able to figure out what the issue was and resolve it.

This location is awesome. The front desk staff is always friendly and helpful. I got to Thomas and he always is professional and personable and has been the best masseuse i've had by far! I'd highly recommend him and this location.  The membership is totally worth it and they even accept your health savings account from your employer as payment!<//Review>

Wonderful! For the best therapeutic massage for aches and pains, ask for Thomas. He knows what he is doing and will work on problem painful areas in a skillful and methodical way. I live in Iowa and have been visiting Sacramento. Unfortunately, I had an accident here and was being treated by a local doctor and physical therapist. They could not help me; Thomas did! Will miss him when I go back!</Text>

< review>
Staff was friendly. Emileigh did my massage and she was awesome. It was my second time getting a massage and she made sure to talk to me about pressure and what I want or don't want, and I like that she was great to talk to too. I would definitely go back for her again. I was slightly disappointed because there are no facials at this location until possibly in the summer, since I live near this location, but that's okay. I also like being told about perks of membership without the pressure to buy right then, the receptionist was friendly about me wanting to take the brochure home to look at. Thank you.<//review>

I went here 4/11/15.  Made the appointment day before the session, staff was very accommodating about getting me in when it was convenient for me. Quick check in, about a ten minute wait for massage therapist in a quiet clean lobby. The massage itself was fantastic. Diedre was my therapist and she was competent and quiet. Upon paying and leaving I was not pressured at all to join. All in all I'd recommend this facility and had a very pleasant experience here.<//Review>

<rate>3< /rate><Review>My fiance says the massage was good. The prices weren't too ridiculous but they're bullying tactics to make someone sign up for a membership are unacceptable in my opinion. In addition, when my fiance called, the lady was very rude to her and matter-of-factly. And even on the phone the lady tried to quote her a higher price than what she actually got charged, telling her if she signed up for a membership and gave her a credit card at that instant, over the phone, she could save money, but; once she came in in person they gave her the real price because they didn't know it was the same person from the phone call and we're much more polite. we'll probably still use Massage Envy, but we definitely won't call them, or; maybe we won't use them at all. Shame on you Massage Envy!</Review>< Pictures>

Massage Envy in Natomas is my go-to place for a relaxing massage.
I have been a regular client for six years now and my therapist, Yoana, always meets my expectations.  The staff is professional and friendly.  I cannot imagine going anyplace else for my massage.< /Text>

First time at this location and I have to say it’a the best one. Lisa greeted me on the way in and my therapist Emileigh was nice and comforting. I hurt my back a couple years ago and she was very tentative to making sure the massage went smooth. Definitely recommend to anyone looking for a great massage.< /Text>

<review>I had terrible headaches and neck pain for years. I have been going to Massage Envy and working with Yoana in her stretch session and getting massages from her. My pain is gone.  Yoana has done an amazing job! I highly recommend Massage Envy in Natomas and ask for Yoana.<//review>< Pictures>

<rate>5< /rate><Text>I had an excellent  massage today at Massage Envy Natomas by a talented, knowledgeable, hardworking masseur named Yoana. She was able to skillfully complete a full-body massage, and she also found time to work on my focus areas, as requested.

It's a privilege to be Yoana's client. It didn't surprise me when she was recently honored as Employee of the Month. I knew intuitively about five minutes into my first massage with her that she is what I'd call a "natural" at her work. She's got that "magic touch" that makes stress, tension, aches, and pains melt away with the magic kneading of her fingers.

Massage Envy Natomas is very fortunate to have such a great masseur on its staff. I think anyone would benefit from receiving a massage from Yoana, and I think she'd be an asset to any massage establishment, anywhere!<//Text>< Pictures>

This is the best laundromat I've ever been to! I'm from out of town, Washington, so I do not know any others from around here. Compared to the ones back home, this one is amazing.<//text>

<Text>Went here because our local laundry was closed for Easter. This place was dirty! Trash was overflowing and the floor looked like it hadn't been swept in years. The way things are set up, you're always bumping into someone. It was relatively cheap and we got out laundry done but we will only becoming here for emergencies.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x80c2b8a49903b66b:0x96a8e97e376b7c09< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I had a ton of laundry to do and wanted to get it done all at once and found this laundromat off a Google search. I got out first to check it out and found it to be large and clean with newer machines. Some of the machines were huge enough to fit a large area rug I have. Also you don’t need coins here, instead you purchase a card a swipe all your charges. The attendant was nice and informative when I asked her how to operate the machines. This place got 5 stars because the attendant was friendly even though I was interrupting her from another task. Unlike so many other places she was pleasant and didn’t give me any attitude. There were plenty of counter space for me to fold my things and a sitting area that was COVID compliant. As far as doing your laundry goes this was a very positive experience.<//Text>< userid>

Love that it's open 24 hours & they seem to have cleaners on top of the sweeping. However, the machines are a bit of a learning curve because they don't have instructions & don't seem cleaned out all that often - probably bc there's no down time.</review>

< Review>
I visited this place a second time and was very disappointed.  I brought my bags and left them near the washing machine to exchange money.  I inserted the money into the device, but it returned them.  At that moment, an employee came up to me and asked what I was doing here.  I replied that I was washing.  Then the employee asked to show my clothes.  I said good as soon as exchanging money.  The employee didn’t say very politely that I would immediately show my clothes.  Seriously?  I understand that everywhere people are concerned that the problem is with the virus.  I was wearing a mask and gloves and did not look like a homeless person, but I do not understand why such a negative attitude towards my person.  When I showed my clothes, the employee did not even apologize.  In this difficult time, when people are left without work, the business must value its customers.  I wanted to leave and never come here again, but I did not want to carry my heavy load once into the car again.  I stayed, and this employee all my stay tried to find any reason to hook me.  I am very unhappy with this.  I do not recommend this place to visit.

Я посетил это место второй раз и остался очень огорчен. Я принес свои сумки и оставил их возле стиральной машины, чтобы разменять деньги. Я вставил деньги в аппарат , но  оно вернул их. В этот момент сотрудник подошёл ко мне и спросил, что я тут делаю. Я ответил, что стираю. Тогда сотрудник попросил показать мою одежду. Я сказал, хорошо, как только разменять деньги. Сотрудник не очень вежливо сказал что бы я сейчас же показал мои одежду. Серьезно? Я понимаю что везде люди обеспокоены тем, что проблема с вирусом. Я был в маске и перчатках и не выглядел, как бездомный, но мне не понятно, почему к моей персоне было такое негативное отношение. Когда я показал мою одежду, сотрудник даже не извенился. В это трудное время, когда люди остаются без работы, бизнес должен ценить своих клиентов. Я хотел уйти и больше никогда сюда не приходить, но я не хотел нести мою тяжёлую однжду  в автомобиль снова. Я остался, а этот сотрудник все мое прибывание пытался найти любой повод зацепить меня. Я очень недоволен этим. Я не рекомендую это место для посещения<//Review>

Have been going to this laundrymat for years! like more than 5 years. I love how there's  a lady or a staff member that constantly cleans and mops the floor. My laundry always comes out really clean too. Because it is 24hours, i would sometimes go here in the middle of the night, just be careful of sketchy people. other than that, i would still come back. Plus they have good vending machines for coffee.<//Text>

In the morning there is a werido Korean fat grouchy guy that owns this place . Stay away. Stay away from mornings period. Come late at night or in the afternoon at least. Don't look at the people in the eye they are sensitive. Stay in your lane and do what you gotta do< /review>

Super clean and efficient washers and dryers. Open 24 HRS, and available parking in front. Many different sized washers and large dryers, perfect for bringing comforters and bedclothes. Coin only, but very affordable.
Attendants and owners are very friendly, and constantly cleaning and doing maintenance. Have been coming here for a few years now.< /Review>

Charge $.25 to use the restroom but they refuse to supply you with soap to wash your hands. Owner talked to me and said he refuses to supply soap. Disgusting and dirty. Who knows what kind of germs there are here.< /text>

All machines - washers and driers - are working properly and constantly maintained. Sometimes it does not receive coins, but the staff working 24 hours there always takes care of it immediately. Most staffs are welcoming and kindly treating customers. It gets crowded in the evening. After 10 pm, it is mostly not crowded. Washing machines are from $2 to $3.50. You can always add a washing cycle for $0.25 or $0.50. This area gets a little bit sketchy after 11 pm.</text>

Crowded and cramped. I felt claustrophobic in there. But ultimately what made me leave without washing my clothes was they had a very limited selection of laundry detergent available in the vending machine and all of it was off-brand.< /Review>

A loyal customer. Last few times I’ve been coming here noticed that washing and drying price went up no biggie I get it. But what took 25 cents to dry before now 5 quarters is over the top. I told the owner who was in house that day. Politely FYI your dyers are not drying like they use to. He was the rudest person ever, in front of my 7 year old he started to scream at me calling me a trouble maker and banned me told me not to come coming back.  Speaking to other ppl around me in Korean making a huge fuss of it. He didn’t believe me, he was calling me a names. I told him my son’s jeans were still really damp he refused to touch it and it was easier to dismiss me like garbage.  I will never come back here and spend my hard earn money here. Respect the ppl in the neighborhood your business is in!! RESPECT PPL PERIOD!!</text>

Bad customer service.
Machine took my money and they automatically assumed that I was lying and that I was trying to wash my clothes for free. SMH... In fact, didn't even get the chance to ask if I could get my money back.<//review>

Machine are my quarters and attendant was no where to be found. After I found him I approached him about the problem and he made it seem like it was my fault for not knowing that one of the machines needs to be smacked a couple times for it to work after I had already put my clothes in a new dryer since he was no where to be found. His response was "talk to the owner". Hispanic man at night, terrible terrible guy. Looks dirty and is a mean character.<//Text>

It's considered a good day if we're able to do our laundry without one of our machines breaking down mid-wash.

Today was definitely not one of those days.
1/20/2019: I counted at least 25 W/D machines already out of service, and 1 of the 2 sinks out of use. It's a typical busy Sunday morning, so it really doesn't help the situation.

We go ahead and complain to one of the service workers about our washer. It clearly didn't complete the last cycle (rinse) since our clothes were DRENCHED. She looked at the machine, insisted we sign our name/problem/$ spent on a paper, and she'd return our $2 later.

We were already folding our clothes once the owner came around. My dad followed up with the problem and the owner insisted that the machine works (since others were using it, unbeknownst to them that it probably wasn't rinsing their clothes--again it's a busy day so for some they just wanna wash and go).

We call over the lady who helped us initially and it's like she had the 'Bird Box' blindfold on. "We showed you the machine, you witnessed the issue and had us sign a paper, right? What was the point of signing that paper then if you're not gonna do anything anyway?" The owner starts yelling at us saying we always complain... but how can we not if none of their sh*t works?!

Ultimately we weren't going to cry over TWO dollars. It's unbelievable that the owner doesn't care about customer service and will never return our money even if it was just a QUARTER CENT loss.  Greedy motherf*ckr.

He cussed us out and we gladly will not return here again. I already set my eyes on another better laundromat nearby.<//review>

< Review>
Christmas eve I went to wash. I had asked for bill change and the young gentleman that was hiding inside the room questioned me on how much I was going to need. I told him I had a lot to wash and what difference it was going to make. He said it's a holiday and that I had to understand. I was getting annoyed and I told him if he was going to give me the change or not. He got annoyed and gave me the change. Now being that it is a holiday and you know that it may get busy, you need to plan ahead. Don't question a customer that is giving you business.< /Review>

Not too different from most laundry, but it feels like this place washes well than others I've been to. My only complaint would be the space; during busy hours, parking can be stressful and it can get quite cramped with people with narrow aisles. Other than those slight inconveniences, I consider this place the go-to for my laundry needs.</Review>

<text>(Translated by Google) It seems that it has been about 7 years since I went to the nano laundromat here...
While doing the laundry that had been collected for several days, I am confident that it will bring me a moment to enjoy the momentary tranquility and relaxation that I have been passing by taking advantage of my lack of time.
I was enjoying the internet and opening the warm laundry from the dryer, which was not short, but it felt cold because of the chilly loneliness of Los Angeles. I already buried my forehead in the running laundry!!!!

It's on Western Road, but the wind is very cool, is it cool elsewhere?...

(Original)
이곳 나노 빨래방을 왕래한지가 약7년정도된듯한데...
며칠간의 모아놨 던 빨래를 하면서 그동안의 시간적 여유가 없음을 팡계 삼아 지나쳐왔던 잠시의 한가로움과여유로움을 만끽할수 있는 여유를 가져다 줌을 자신한다.
인터넷을 즐기고 있다가 짧지 만은 아닌 건조기에서 나온 따뜻한빨래를 개고있자니 쌀쌀해져있 던 LA의 외로움과 함께하기에 추위 로 느꼈던 그것은 이미 개져가는 빨래 속에 이마 묻어놨네!!!!

여긴 웨스턴 길에 있지만 바람이 아주 시원하네요.다른곳은 시원한가요?...<//text>< Pics>

(Translated by Google) When I was doing laundry in a laundromat around here, I was so absurd that I came here to wash the wet laundry in another laundromat.. Generally, the washing machine capacity is not large, so I had to wash it in two places. When I tried to take it out after drying it in two, I saw that my favorite dress at the front of the machine was twisted to see if it was stuck somewhere in the front of the machine, and it was caught in a crack near the door of the dryer, and I couldn't take it out no matter how much I tried to take it out. I heard that the clothes are going to be damaged by pulling them with force, so I couldn’t take them out, and I asked if I would cut them with scissors. I couldn't see any apology or responsibility. I thought it wasn't so big that anyone would see me as a wrong person...

이곳부근빨래방에서 빨래를 하다가 너무 어처구니없는 일을겪게되서 물에젖은 빨래감을 다른빨래방에서 세척하기위해서 여기로 오게되었다..대체적으로 여기는 세탁기용량이 크지않아서 두군데로 나눠빨아야했다.가장큰싸이즈의 건조기두개로 건조를 하고서 꺼내려고 가보니 기계앞부분에서 가장좋아하는 원피스가 어딘가에 걸렸는지 꽈베기를 꼬는것을보고 봤더니 건조기문근처의 파여진 틈에끼었고 아무리꺼내려해도 꺼낼수없었다.직원에게 빼달라했는데 옷에뜯기는소리가 나는데도 힘으로 잡아당겨대길래 옷이망가질것같다고하니까 그럼 꺼낼수없다면서 가위로 자를거냐고 묻길래 어의없어서 사장을 보고싶다니까 내일아침일찍오라고.....옷은 결국 낀체로 놔두고..아무런 사과나 책임의식도 볼수없었다 누가보면 내가 잘못한사람으로 보일만큼 대수롭지않아했었다...<//Text>

<text>(Translated by Google) On August 16th, I went to the laundry, but the soap bubbles didn't come out, so I asked the people who worked.
I turned three places in a large washing machine in front of the beverage machine (washing down blankets). It's a house with children, so I bought laundry soap there...

<time>1572072425662<//time><Response>None</Response><Text>(Translated by Google) Unfriendly. When I first visited and I didn't know well, I asked to buy detergent, but I didn't know why I didn't like it. And if someone asks you, you have to answer. I want to buy a detergent. So I asked how much it is, so I just say the price and look back again. I didn't ask you a question, but I politely asked ... I still don't forget that look. Looking at a person like a cockroach. Then I turn the washing machine and I don't know why I keep staring at people.
When I first visited and pondered whether I made a mistake because I didn't know it, I don't think I made any mistake. It's crazy how you ignore people. I can't forget the look when I look at it. I didn't go to dawn or late at night ... I just didn't like talking. I went to run the washing machine once in the morning, and I just got dirty all day long.

불친절. 처음 방문해서 잘 몰라서 세제 구입하고 싶다고 질문 한번 했는데 무슨 못볼 걸 본 사람처럼 인상 팍팍 찡그리고 궁시렁거리면서 싫어하는 티 왜그렇게 내는지 모르겠음. 그리고 사람이 물어봤으면 대답을 해야지. 세제 구입하고 싶다니깐 무슨 세제하나 딱 꺼내놓고 먼산바라보거 있음. 그래서 얼마냐고 물어보니깐 그제서야 가격 딱 말하고 다시 먼산 바라보고 있음. 건방지게 질문한 것도 아니거 정중하게 질문했드만... 아직도 그 표정이 안잊혀짐. 무슨 바퀴벌레 보듯 사람을 바라봄. 그리고나서 세탁기 돌리는데 아니 왜 계속 사람을 힐긋힐긋 처다보는지 모르겠음.
처음 방문해서 내가 잘 몰라서 실수라도 한건지 곰곰이 생각을 해봐도 내가 무슨 실수를 한 건 아닌 것 같음. 왜이리 사람을 대놓고 무시하는지 이정도면 미친 수준임. 바라볼 때의 그 표정 잊을수가 없음. 새벽시간이나 밤늦게 간것도 아닌데... 그냥 말 거는것 자체가 싫었나봄. 아침에 세탁기 한번 돌리러 갔다가 하루종일 기분만 더럽히고 옴.<//Text>< Gmap_id>

Great food. If ordering from the drive thru make sure you check your food before leaving for accuracy. I've been coming here for years and just recently I've experienced numerous mistakes in my orders on several visits. They are very quick to fix the mistakes for you when you bring your food back.<//Text>

I crave it and I must do the drive that's how much I love them. The workers are amazing I started to see new faces but its nice to still have some of the people that worked there for many years.

< review>
$ 11 for a All meat Burrito,  i remember how they were much bigger before. When i received my drive thru back i was surprised it was like light weight.  Then when i looked at it , was just abit bigger than those microwave burritos.  I asked for extra green sauce inside the burrito,  because ill be driving,  failed did not do. And the meat tasted abit burned. I wanted the food i loved before,  but maybe a new owner, and cutting cost , not my enjoyment again.  I really still felt still abit hungry after finishing it. Should of gone else where. Since they been getting customers back, is not the time to be soo cheap on them. They took away what we loved about this place of years ago. Quality and portions have gone way down,  but the price went soo much higher. Even look at large drink portions,  was a huge cup before,  now its like a medium sice cup for their large choice. No more.<//review>

<review>I lived here in LP for 8 years. This is the first time I tried this spot. The combo burrito with carnitas sour cream and guacamole was good. $9.00 was the total. The red sauce is hot but just right.< /review><user_id>114971653331676817498</user_id>< username>

<Text>3 tacos de pastor filled with meat, cheese cabbage. Enough falls off one taco that you can literally make another one. And the word delicious doesn't do it justice. 2 bucks a taco is well worth it. They have burritos too packed the same!<//Text></record>

<response>None</response><review>Ahhhhh Chorro Del Rio. Love those huge carne asada burritos with everything and both green and red salsa. You pay for it every time! So good. Our favorite giant 8 dollar burrito spot. I'm not one who has to stand there and supervise my burrito maker ensuring it has too much of everything so it can't even close. I'm hapoy in the drive thru. Make it how you make it. I'm good. I'll chill in my car and listen to Techno.< /review>< Gmap_id>

Customer service was a wonderful experience coming from a seasoned customer service world myself....The Owner was very generous with the meat and onions in the pastor burrito. There was not a lot of beans which is the way I like it. The red salsa has just the rite amount of spice while the green is mild very enjoyable . Thank you so much for serving great food!<//review>

<text>I've lived in La Puente for 25 years and this is only the second I've been here. I had my reasons but today I decided to try it again. The young lady who took my order was patient and kind. Sadly I had to go back because my order was wrong. Another kind young lady helped me when I returned. They gave me the correct order without any issues. I recognized a familiar face in the kitchen which made feel even better.  I give 5 stars because their food was good and everyone there was great. I will be back soon.  Thank you Blanca and everyone else.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Besides the long wait in line
If people already ordered should be asked to move to the left
The customer service was amazing outside was very Clean
The food wasn't what I expected
Don't get me wrong it was good but it was missing something and the red salsa was just hot and no flavor</review>

<Time>1593359157394< /Time><Text>Small taco shop with good tacos. It wasn't clear when I ordered when they asked if I wanted 'everything' that it meant a higher charge with lots of toppings instead of just the usual onions, cilantro and hot sauce, and I was not expecting to pay $20 for 6 tacos (no sides). The toppings included onions, guacamole, sour cream, fresh shredded cheese and hot sauce. I appreciate all the toppings but could barely taste the taco. Carnitas pretty dry. I would try them again though, my friend really enjoyed them. They have a walk up window with small patio out front.<//Text><response>None</response><name>Serena A</name>< Rate>

The cook had his mask on his chin and talking while preparing my burrito. I asked for a combo burrito and he ended adding guacamole and cream without asking me if I wanted extra toppings and was charged for it. The cashier wasn't wearing a mask. Ended up not finishing the burrito and throwing it away. Will never go there again!!< /review>

My family just moved into this area & when in Rome do as.... but not very impressed. Sorry  followers of Boca Del Rio. A simple Carne Asada did not have too much flavor, likewise the quacamole mix was missing something could figure it out, but both sub-par.. we definitely did not leave hungry, very big portions that's the plus 4 star however flavor :( ..< /Text></record>

<review>My first experience at Boca was in 1989. My roommate and I drove up from our dorm at Pepperdine. It was a bit of drive, and the area is well.....  but I have been back literally 100’s of times since then. Over the years the food is consistently outstanding! Have yet to find a better “two handed” burrito in all of Los Angeles.</review>< pictures>

My favorite tacos and burritos to order here are the lengua or tongue meat. I want all the beans, cheese, lettuce, cabbage and onions on there and I like the red salsa better than the green salsa.</Review>

This is old school! Just recently went back after 25 years and it hasn't changed one bit. Food is satisfying and filling to say the least. It was packed with people waiting in line waiting to order just like I remembered.< /text>

I've worked in the La Puente/Hacineda Heights area for 15 years and have not found better Lengua tacos anywhere else.  The tacos are fully loaded and filling, with lengua that is firm but still juicy.  The only downside is the seating is outside only, so eating there on 100+ degree days is out for me.  Portions are generous and the meats are prepared perfectly.</text>

The wait is atrocious. The line is stretched and the service is slow. Expect a 15 minute wait if 4 people are ahead of you<//Review>

Guilty Pleasure.

Food here is messy, but tasty.

First off, I gotta say, if you're a cheese lover, this place offers a generous amount of cheese on their dishes. I absolutely love it.

Tacos are good, and the burritos too. But my absolute favorite is the Asada Quesadillas. That is an absolute hit.<//text>

What can I say about this place. The tacos they have here are just the best tacos ever!!! There is so much flavor with every bite that  your taste buds will thank you. They pack every taco and burrito with a mountain of meat (asada, pastor, chicken, lingua, carnitas) highly recommend this place! Dont judge this book by it cover it's a really delicious place! Also the quesadillas r really good too! What are you waiting for go eat a taco at this place you wont be disappointed!<//review>

<Review>Boca has been around forever and everytime I go my burrito taste the same which is great!!!! I love the quality control in the taste of the food. Now the service on the other hand.....eehhhh.....the shorter older man that always wears the baseball cap that's been there forever has such a hard time listening to you on how you want your food. Every single time is the same, he ask what you want and don't want, you answer and he does the opposite. But food is bomb!!!!!!< /Review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x80c2d6474c8131ef:0xc4c4dc2b737046b1<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Worth every penny. A lot of bang for your buck and the food is delicious. Don't forget to bring your appetite and dont be afraid of the long line it moves very quickly. Be very careful with the red Chile it will put hair on your chest. If you're a light weight, stick with the green salsa, I do.<//Text>

< Review>
We travel into town from the inland empire  and have always enjoyed the burritos & tacos here. We always tell people of this place and hook them and they to do the drive. It's worth it. It's a place where you eat out side & no wash room so be prepared. Other than that, yum! Enjoy!</Review>

We've been coming here for years.  The food is tasty.  Yet the prices have gone up recently.  Also, there has been a change in staffing where the newer employees do not know what they're doing.  There is a definite issue with their register ringing up prices higher than what is on their signage.  When asked about this, the cashier said the difference was "taxes".  Well the current tax rate in La Puente is at 9.5%.  So this eatery is charging 25% in tax!  Someone call the Commissioner of Weights and Measures PLEASE!!!  Prepare to be gouged.</Text>

<Review>I've worked in the La Puente/Hacineda Heights area for 15 years and have not found better Lengua tacos anywhere else.  The tacos are fully loaded and filling, with lengua that is firm but still juicy.  The only downside is the seating is outside only, so eating there on 100+ degree days is out for me.  Portions are generous and the meats are prepared perfectly.<//Review>< Pics>

Last time we went here my husband got food poisioning.  I didn't eat there because the way they were making the food looked unsanitary.  I ate next door at the depot.  I didnt get sick.  My husband said he will never eat there again.< /Review>

Try the nachos, made with your choice of meat and toppings! And the overstuffed burritos. The tacos are great too... And don't forget the drinks. Horchata Jamaica sodas...</review>< Pics>

My number one place for tacos and burritos. I have been coming to Boca for almost 30 years now and have never been disappointed. Burritos are huge and tasty and there is no skimping on ingredients. I highly recommend trying it at least once to see if you get hooked too.< /Review>

My personal favorite taqueria I'll continue to recommend this place to friends family and first timers. Usually a wait during certain days but well worth it. A variety of meats and all are tender and well marinated. They really stuff and stack fat kid size portions into burritos and tacos here. Again im definitely a fan boy of this location been going here since the age of 7 well over 20 years and the quality has never changed.< /review>

I've been coming here for over 30 years. Nothing fancy about this place but if you want good food this is the Taco Shack for you. Hard Park like bench seating in front, a little run down. Our family refers to this place has "Mexican ice cream" because it taste so good, literally you will go home and smack your mama.< /Text>

My personal favorite taqueria I'll continue to recommend this place to friends family and first timers. Usually a wait during certain days but well worth it. A variety of meats and all are tender and well marinated. They really stuff and stack fat kid size portions into burritos and tacos here. Again im definitely a fan boy of this location been going here since the age of 7 well over 20 years and the quality has never changed.</text>

Best tacos and burritos, wish there was a place like this where I live, but loved this place since I was a little girl. Whew, I want some right now lol. The original spot in LA Puente taste better to me for some reason compared to the one in Covina.< /review>

If you ever find yourself in the Boise area, we would highly recommend stopping in, and trying both the grilled cheese and the tuna nicoise sandwiches!

<Rating>1< /Rating><Review>The food is good and most of the people who work here are nice. However the older gentleman with the cap who seems to be in charge is rude, a coward, and a racist. He messed up my order and when I politely asked him to correct it, he threw the plate down to the side and called me a racial slur for Chinese people in Spanish to one of his other co workers. Unfortunately I don't think he realized that even though I was Asian, I can still speak and understand Spanish. Funny how when you pretend not to speak a language how much you can ascertain about people's true natures. Ironic too, as with him being a minority himself, he should have understood and respected other races better. As a man, if he had a problem with me, he should have said it to my face instead of calling me something he's thought I didn't understand to one of his co workers.
In the end, I stayed calm, smiled at him, kept a close eye on him as he cooked my food and ultimately got my new plate, as I had already waited too long in line to just give him the satisfaction of storming off. However it will be my last time going here. From reading other reviews below, it seems as though I'm not the only one who feels this way about the service here. I would suggest everyone else try Pepe's Mexican food as an alternative. As a veteran who has fought for this country, I feel deeply let down that I come home to a country where I am racially prejudiced against (ironically by someone who speaks even less english than me lol)< /Review>< pics>

I have been eating at Boca for over 30+ years. The food, the service and many of the people have been the same the whole time. Although I frequent all of the locations over the years. The original location on Hacienda is my favorite. Easy menu consistent food is what keeps me coming back. When they say dont judge a book by its cover, Boca is what they are talking about!! The prices they are amazing $2.75 for a taco special, this includes avacado and sour cream...WOW...you wont get this anywhere else. Lastly dont let the line discourage you,  its worth the wait, besides it gives you a chance to make up your mind.  Seriously though the line moves pretty quickly!!< /Text>

The place is just a stand, has seating shade to eat under. Everything very fresh. Order salsa/chile on the side. I dont like spicey however my friend who does said its especially hot. Dont order cheese nachos we were going to split among friends not knowing how big the burrito was. Those were gross chips and cheese both were gross stick with burrito thsts excellent .</Review></record></dataset><record>

Carne Asada tacos with everything on them are the best with chili verde.Red sauce is hotter if you prefer that.< /text>

<text>Quite possibly one of the best Mexican food joints in the area. Open until 3AM, no tax, good portions, pretty cheap ($6 flat for a burrito with all the frills). Unfortunately, no Al Pastor meat, just regular pork.<//text>< user_name>

Been a long time and for me, the original Green Burrito that used to be next door was better. Have to say that I wasn't feeling very welcomed at the order window.</Review>

I was looking forward to try their food for the first time since I read the reviews, I got a quesadilla de asada with beans  and a side of guacamole , worst thing I ever ate , not worth the hype.< /Review>

Always great for tacos. Similar to Taco del Rio but honestly better and more flavorful. The salsa along with the tacos and burritos are a must. They all types of meat, lengua included and the asada nachos are hugee. Portions are big so don't underestimate them< /review>

Burrito special! Choice of meat, piled high and your choice of generous portions of onion, cilantro, shreded cabbage, lots of grated Monterey jack, sour cream, avocado, and salsa. I've been coming here on and off for about 20 years. They've been consistent. Try it once...if you enjoy it, keep going back.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Food is real Mexican ! Smothered in shredded cheese, diced cabbage, HOT Chile uum so good. A whole in the wall, but those are the best kind. I always get chicken tacos and throw one carne asada in, so i don't regret not ordering. Orchata drink the best. My husband and I have been going there since dating 30 years ago. Stop any time were driving through la Puente</Text>

(Translated by Google) Good tacos were grated avocado cheeses the green sauce is less spicy than the red one the red sauce is to beat but they are good.The tacos are worth three 2.30 to 2.50 or more if they had everything like avocado cream the avocado is more expensive the taco if it comes 100% good avocado for me

(Original)
Buenos tacos yeban quesos rallado aguacate las salsa verde está menos picosa que la roja la salsa roja está para yorar pero estan buenos.los tacos valen en tres 2.30 a 2.50  o más si tenían todo como crema aguacate el aguacate es más caro el taco si lleba aguacate 100% buenos para mí gusto</text>
