<text>The place has recently changed it’s name to Pho Seven. My first time coming in, the place is very clean and modern looking. There is not too many customers there and there was not any distinct odor that you would normally smell in a Pho restaurant so I was a little worried. The owner came up to me and gave me some ideas on what I might enjoy. He was extremely pleasant, spoke English really well and was very knowledgeable about the entire menu. I ordered the crispy noodles with sautéed seafood and vegetables and the sauce was perfect. It didn’t require   any additional sauce. I can’t wait to go back and try other dishes there. And their prices were very reasonable.<//text><Response>None</Response><time>1580788536732< /time>< Pictures>

<Rate>1</Rate><text>If I could give this place a negative review, I would. But people need to know that this place is not sanitary. I received a steak dice dish that didn't taste too bad (though overpriced),  but I found two pieces of short, straight black hair in it. I decided that I would just eat around it instead of asking them to make more, but when I told them at the cash register and showed them the hairs, the two ladies working there said their hair was too long for it to be theirs, when it actually did fit the description, and they didn't offer a discount. Meanwhile my hair is long and very curly, and the people I was with had had short pink hair and short light brown hair. Clearly it was not ours. They said they had cameras to prove that it wasn't theirs, but there were no cameras in the dining area that I could find, let alone in the area where we'd eaten. They completely denied being careless. So I'm writing this review to warn everyone to not eat here unless they're okay with unsanitary practices. I only paid because they clearly needed the money.< /text>< pictures>

New owners, new hours (9:00am - 9:30pm, seven days), newly freshened interior. The menu has been revamped also, but the contents seem very similar if not exactly the same; I'll try to get photos of the menu next time.

They still have bargain prices for pho; you won't get as much meat as at other places that cost more, so you have to decide if the trade off is worth it to you.

Supposedly the kitchen staff is unchanged. Certainly the pho broth seems very similar to me, a little sweeter than I would prefer, but still quite good.< /text>

Under new ownership. The fried rice you use to get a large portion in a big box now it is a small portion in a small box a quarter of what you use to get. Eggrolls were ok I wouldn't order them again.<//Text>

This place is the best place by far that I have ever been to. I drive all the way from Laguna Beach to come here for their amazing food. Their prices are excellent and I enjoy the way I am treated and served. They treat you like family here and are so nice in person and over the phone. The place is clean and again the food is by far the best pho I have ever had and their spring rolls are great too. They don't come apart like other places and they accommodate vegetarians with substitute items available. I wouldn't drive this far if I didn't think the prices were worth it or the quality of food. I am so glad I found this place years and years ago! Thanks pho lam son!<//text>

One of my favorite Pho spots in all of OC. Great value and great taste. Friendly staff that makes you feel at home.  Language barrier is there, but nothing to worry about. Amazing weekly spot, to cure a hangover, enjoy some soup and their amazing fried rice.<//Text>

<review>I love this office! The staff is super friendly, they explain everything in detail and even call to make sure you understand your co-Pay obligations. I had a deep clean today with Donney and she was super amazing, made sure I was comfortable and checked in with me frequently. Mind you this is typically a multi day appointment and I wanted it done in one. Did I mention they are super accommodating? Definitely come check it out!</review>< Pictures>

I love them! I have 4 kids that they seen quickly. My younger boys were a little task but they had so much patience with them which made them very comfortable. Going forward they’re looking forward to their appointments like going to the park. Will never  change dental offices again.</Review>

< Review>
Smile time is the best experience I've ever had in a dentist office. Donney cleaned my teeth and I would adopt her as my sister. My teeth feel great! and Tammy at the front desk helped me a lot as well. The team in this office works well together and are awesome. The office is well kept, smells fresh and doesnt make you feel uncomfortable. They deserve a raise!<//Review>

I have been coming to this location for almost a year and we love it. We especially loved Linda who is really good at the cleaning services they offer.

Would definitely recommend choosing this office for all your family dentist needs.</Review>

<Review>Same as Kevinlymd, was scheduled for a deep cleaning not covered by insurance, right side was charged at $580 and the left at $270. Was told x-rays were resubmitted and the left side would be done in the time being, now they are telling me that they are both $580 because it wasn't covered but the bill shows that the total was $360 without insurance. I have called multiple times and they refuse to fix this, look elsewhere and save your money.< /Review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

We drove almost an hour to get there. We were within the five minute time frame. The woman behind the counter spent a few minutes helping someone in front of us and so the dentist decided to refuse us. We will not be returning to Smile Time Dental. They cram as many people on their Dentists as possible.<//Text>

<text>Wonderful dentist (Dr. Tia)She and her staff are very friendly. My wife even switched to her. Also, she is with kids-I too.  my 7 year old for her first "check-up" and she was great with her! She has convenient hours and I didn't have to wait long for my first appointment or when I need to change appointment time.</text>< name>

I’ve been to this office for quite a few times. And I am very happy here, everyone is very friendly. I get scared to come to the dentist but with Smile Time they make me feel comfortable and at ease. Dr. Jack has a great hand for inserting the anesthesia. Melisa is also great. Front office is great as well, Lupita explains everything very thorough and whenever I have a question she explains it in detail. Also makes me aware of all the copay amounts before my appointments if there is one. Also great availability and she accommodates me to the best she can.
Great office!< /text>

I called to schedule a first visit and they were able to see me the very next day, then schedule a routine filling within the same week. The staff are very friendly and personable, while the space is open, bright, and clean.

Nobody enjoys going to the dentist, but everyone from the receptionists to the dentists themselves do a great job of making visits calm and reassuring.<//text>

The clinic is a handsome office in appearance.  I like how it's been renovated.  The dental assistants and whole staff are courteous and polite.  The clinic also has a very sharp Office Manager Laura Ortega.  She has amazing memory.  No wonder the branch runs so efficiently.  Laura seems to have become a Professional at her job and running Smile Time.< /review>

For years I’ve always been squeamish at the dentist. This is the first time in my life that a doctor, the dental assistances, and the staff, have made me feel at ease. They are all very professional. The office and rooms are well-maintained and clean.
Dr Gorman is the greatest!! Tania is also wonderful!! I have already referred my daughter here and she loves it. I will never go anywhere else. If you want great service and professional service you need to come to the Elk Grove location. Thanks Elk Grove Team!
Your Client for life,
Annamarie.< /review>

<review>I will go to smile care from now on for all my dental needs! The staff is so kind and caring, and I feel so fortunate to have been able to work with doctor Johnson. My case was not an easy one, but through the whole process doctor Johnson was so reassuring and kind.  Yolanda made billing my insurance quick and easy. Highly recommend Elk Grove smile care. No one likes to go to the Dentist, but when you find yourself in that situation, it's so nice to have such a kind and caring staff.  I absolutely love my new smile.  😃</review>< date>

I suffer from extreme anxiety especially coming to the dentist and I’ve heard horror stories of how painful the deep cleanings are but he put me at such ease and I experienced absolutely no pain at all.

Horrible experince. At the  place.  That i had to find me different  dentist. How do can he do cleaning with no toothpaste or paste?. Also did fillings now my gum area where filling is has a gap . Customer care stunk. Only the receptionist trying to schedule future appointment was amicable.👎🏼< /review>

<review>Dr. Alex is great but the staff bills you at the highest amount possible and then when you ask for other billing options they beat around the bush and tell you if you use those other options you might still have the same condition. I go in for a cavity and they do an exam with in 45 minutes and you don't get your cavity filled or cleaning.I then have to make another appointment with another copay because they don't have the record of my x-ray from the previous location and don't have time to do my cavity.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

It was the only place that was able to accommodate me (the 5th dental office I called) in a very short notice and was willing to check my “never heared” ppo dental insurance. The place is very new, very clean, modern technology, all the staff are very friendly, helpful, and experts in their field. I’m so happy and thankful that God sent me to this place “smile time dental”.</Review>< pictures>

Very throughout with cleaning and tooth repair the dentist is so light on the hand when it comes to the shots so that’s definitely a plus !! Dental care isn’t always cheap but they do monthly payments which is ideal for a single mom like me ! My kids go to kids dentist plus an love it there too they are not scared of the dentist here ♥️<//review>

<Text>Smile time has been a god send. My family and I were very unhappy at our old dentist and my husband had terrible tooth pain from a broken filling, we had to schedule appointments months out and received no response at times. We switched to smile time and we able to get in immediately. At my husband's first appointment they were able to correct his filling and put him out of pain. We are so so so pleased with them.< /Text><userid>100439859839380734544<//userid><rating>5<//rating>< Time>

<Text>Dr. Mann is the greatest Dr i have ever been with. I have had a full upper denture made here and had it adjusted once by Dr, Mann and never needed it adjusted no more. It fits so perfect. she also adjusted a partial i had done some where else where i could not wear it since i got it and also took it to Dr.Mann once and with her magic hands my partial fits with no pain. Dee Dee and Yasmin are also friendly and nice to me when i come into office they treat me like family. Will be coming back again and also bringing my family. Sincerely Rosa Lopez< /Text>< Pictures>

I am a new patient but I could not be more happier with my experience at Smile Time dental! After years of feeling swept under the rug by my previous dental office I finally feel like I have found the dental office right for me.  Starting with my oral exam I felt like the dentist cared about nothing more than what was best for me . Everyone in the office is very friendly and helpful. Overall I would say it is a very inviting and judgement free zone.</Review>

Maybe I encountered two of the office staff on consecutive bad days, but they lost my appointment and did not understand how a DHMO plan works.  The unfortunate lack of knowledge means I didn't even get to be seen by the dentist.  Prestige Dental across the freeway was quick to accommodate me and was able to work with the insurance company seamlessly and in a pinch.< /Text>

<rate>4</rate><review>I was skeptical about this place because of how hard it was to get someone to pick up the phone let alone making an appointment.  I held my breath and decided to go through it and took my mom in. To my surprise all the staff were so helpful and extremely friendly.  Then I met saw Dr Ho, hmm so young and not sure if he would be experience enough. Omg, the result of the examination was exactly what I expected since my mom saw 2 very experienced dentists prior to.  He was thorough, detailed and he listened.  So why 4 stars and not 5? I wish they can take care of calls better but I think they have a centralized location for this.</review>< date>

<Text>First review ever, my experience was awesome.  The staff very professional.  Doctor Grady, is a Boss in more ways than one.  I had to have major work done.  I had anticipated hours, got myself all worked up for nothing.  I was in and out in 55 minutes, and that's including paperwork and wait time.  Wow!!!

<review>SmileCare Elk Grove was a great experience. The office is located near the 99 exit, which made it very convenient when commuting.  The staff is friendly and professional. I’ve been visiting Dr. Luu for over one year and all my visits have been on time, with minimal wait time thanks to his staff, Viet, Erica, Angela, and Teresa.
I would recommend the Elk Grove location to anyone looking for a professional and affordable orthodontist.< /review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x809ac7028b5e4bad:0xab65c38677d0c280< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Our family has been to many different dentists in Elk Grove and many times we were disappointed with the service or with our insurance co-payments. We found SmileCare via our insurance website. Wow what a find! Kids said dental checkup was great, one kid with multiple cavities couldn't wait to get cavities fixed.
Next is Ortho and Oral Surgeon for wisdom teeth. Everyone is right here in this office. Boys are so excited for braces!
Dr Bandala so calm and explains everything. He makes the dental appointments stress free with his chair side manners. He focuses on his patient in the chair and makes you his priority. We are so happy he comes to Elk Grove! I can't rave enough about going to the dentist!!!<//text>

<Review>I went to Smile Time in Elk Grove today and had a blast. All the ladies and gents were friendly and professional.  The doctor and the assistant cleaned and polished my teeth to the max.  I will keep my big smile because I went to Smile Time on time.  Special shout out to Laura for her professionism bprofessionism for finding an open appointment today and the young man that took xrays, polished my teeth and assisted the Doctor in cleaning my teeth and examining them.  Smile Time in Elk Grove is the place to go.  There is a young staff with gettie up.💯<//Review>< resp>

<Rate>1</Rate><Text>After 5-6 phone calls requesting paperwork for a oral surgery appt. I finally received the paperwork in the mail and sent it back. 2 weeks later I had to call in to confirm they got it and at that time the person on the phone said she had it on her desk. Then i find out the Oral Surgeon is only there once a week in the middle of the week. So i make an appt. that is 6 weeks out and specifically ask if a adult can go in on my behalf for the consultation. Was told yes and was told to have a signed letter sent. Of course, now that is all changed and my child and the adult family member she went with was told no. a 1 hour drive to the office plus months wasted because of their incompetence. So they send my child who is in pain away and will not see her. This is the most unprofessional place I have dealt with. The manager should go back to running a jiffy lube.< /Text>< pics>

A pleasant surprise. A broken lower denture caused me to call late Tuesday and Erica made sure that I had an appointment early (9:30) the next morning. Wonderful!
The pleasures kept coming upon my arrival, even after completing the typical, oh so long, first-time patient paperwork moved me right along to a wonderful dental assistant for X-rays and into an exam room. Dr “Vijay” was professional, friendly, and went out of his way to help me without much scolding about my diy attempt at repairing the break. Whew!
Follow up appointments are coming as updated reviews as the process continues.< /text>

<Text>Staff here is very rude and lazy. I had to make several phone calls just to get them to do their own job and send out authorization request. If I wasn't forced to go here due to my medical insurance I would never step foot in this place again.< /Text><userid>110654333489295940866< /userid>< rating>

if i can give this place a negative star, i would.  avoid under all circumstances!!  this place is terrible.  they don't even know how to collect there funds that have been okay'd by your insurance.  they will bill you because they cannot do their job!!  they told me to call the insurance and try to get the funds for them.  i received one notice in the mail last month and called them right away.  they said they would call me back and never did!!!  terrible place!! horrible customer service.  they are charging me 850 bucks that i never signed for and already sent it to collections!  i hope this review can help someone.  I called my insurance and they said that the mistake was made by smile care.  when i called smile care, they told me that this is what they do when they get no response from insurance.  they get the customer to call them.  this is total b.s.<//Text>

<rating>1<//rating><review>Appointment for 1 tooth extraction took me 2 whole hours. Lazy, unprofessional team. Did not connect at all with the dentist, did not reassure me about what I should and should not do after the extraction. There were streaks of dried blood on my chin!!! They didn't even have the audacity to wipe it off. If it wasn't due to referral from insurance plan would never ever go again!<//review><pics>None<//pics>< Name>

Very unprofressional place. The place is also not clean at all. And to add to all of this insult the lady who is the head oral sugeon is extremly racist. She made me feel very bad about myself. I would never take my kids here if they are any minority. Please have this place shutdown. Ms. Grady is the most immature dentist i have ever met, while being very unpolite with anyone who was not white. Please blacks, latinos, or any other minority dont let these people work on your kids mouth.. i beg you. Grady will hurt your child purposley.  #shutsmilecaredown</text>

<review>Scam. They do stuff with out telling you and then at end charge you extra for it + copays. There plan is to get the most out of your pocket and also bill the crap out of your insurance. I was in there and waiting for doctor to come check my teeths. first doctor came in did the exam checked all teeths and left then another doctor came in checked all teeths all over again. spent 1hr and 30min doing nothing.

Noble Gold truly lives up to expectations. My experience has been wonderful. Zach is the Gold & Silver expert in house and truly lives up to that title. He took the time to teach me what I needed to know to be confident in investing my retirement. He bends over backwards to answer my questions and keeps in constant contact regarding my investment. I only wish I had taken the leap sooner! Thank you to the Noble Gold team and Zach , I couldn’t be happier!< /text>

I wanted to offset some of the volatility of my other investments, and precious metals seems like the best choice. No matter how the markets swing, Silver, Gold and precious metals will *always* hold value. I chose Noble Gold simply because my research on investment companies did not reveal a single bad review of their exchange! Setting up my account and making the exchange was a simple and painless process. Several of my friends and co-workers who are also nearing retirement age have asked me about Noble Gold, and I have highly recommend them.< /Review>

The service they provided was excellent, especially by My representative Steven Dhanjal.  He was prompt getting back to me with questions or concerns and was very thorough in explaining precious medals as an investment option. They guided me through the process of creating my precious metals IRA and did not pressure me into one investment over another. They provided me with the relevant information and allowed me to make the decision while remaining support. I will definitely use Noble Gold in the future for further needs and would highly recommend their services to anyone else looking to invest in precious metals.<//Review><Rating>5<//Rating>< Pics>

I was a bit nervous about moving my 401k over to precious metals.  It took me a couple of months after my retirement to make the decision. I'm  glad I chose Noble Gold.  My initial contact was with Jeff Dillon who was so patient and helpful answering all my questions.  He and everyone else  I have communicated with have been awesome!<//review>

My husband and myself were real nervous about the big purchase in metal that our family wanted and did some research. Steven was soo helpful and made the experience so easy and made sure we were very satisfied with the overall purchase. I would recommend them to everyone. We will always buy our metals from Noble Gold.<//review>

So glad I chose Noble. Everyone I have dealt with has been extremely professional. All have also been courteous, kind, friendly and helpful.
Even though I am a new customer and had tons of questions, I never felt like an outsider. They graciously spent as much time with me as I needed to feel comfortable in the decision making process. I really felt like a long time customer.
Im not normally a review writer, but was so impressed I took the time to write this.<//text>

<text>One of the easiest business transactions I have ever made.  Zach Ward was patient and very helpful and seemed to be as excited for me as I was for me!  It was such a pleasure to talk to a live person without having to go through a menu of 100 questions.  I have no doubt I made the right decision and I know Noble Gold will be there to answer any questions I may have in the future.  Noble Gold is doing business the way it should be done.</text>< Pics>

Ryan spent about 45 minutes on the phone helping me understand more about the market, and told me not to hesitate to call if I have any questions.
I have recently opened an account with them and the experience was great.
I will recommend Noble Gold to everyone who will listen.< /text>< Pictures>

I had an excellent experience with setting up my IRA with Noble Gold. The online process was simple to follow and then there was no high pressure phone calls from the team members, they were polite and contacted me by email first, and followed up with timely phone calls afterward. They were super helpful in assisting me throughout the transaction and made me feel at ease. I do not have experience with this type of thing and it can be a bit intimidating, but, again, the team members helped me through it by explaining everything and answering all my questions. I am very glad to be working with them and excited for the future.< /Review>

I was not always 100% clear on what the overall process was going to be, but in fairness I have a tendency to ask way more questions and want way more details than most people. What I liked the most was that my rep let me know if I ever decide to buy precious metals locally, to call him so I can make sure I am not getting a bum deal by a local coin shop or pawn shop owner.< /review>< Pictures>

I was referred to Noble Gold by a trusted friend and they did not disappoint. They were very professional and explained everything in simple terms so my simple mind could understand. Throughout the entire process of transferring a portion of my Roth IRA to a Gold IRA, they were communicative and answered any questions I had in a very timely manner, both via phone and email. I would definitely recommend them and use them again for future IRAs and other precious metal investments.< /Review>

This is a very honest and professional company. When buying precious metals through an IRA you need  a company that does what they say and has the best prices on their metals. I found Yale Augustine and Karina to be very knowledgeable, professional and reliable. The company is top notch. I highly recommend using Noble Gold for your precious metals purchasing. I am so glad I did!<//Review>

<text>Noble Gold Investments staff were so informative and helpful with the  process.  They explained everything clearly and in a way that was super easy to understand.  They helped in every step of the process making it so fast and simple.  I dreaded doing all the paperwork that would be involved, but shouldn't have been.  They helped me through each step and made it almost effortless.  Everyone that I spoke to was so helpful, informative and professional.  I definitely highly recommend getting in touch with Noble Gold if you are considering diversifying your portfolio or if you just have questions about gold, silver, platinum, pilladium or even bitcoin.  Thank you to everyone at Noble Gold!!!</text><Date>1600876555626</Date><rate>5</rate></record>

<text>Noble Gold was very responsive to my questions and concerns.  When I made my initial call I received kind and courteous response from the first person that I talked to.  She transferred me to a representative who answered all of my questions and was patient with my inquiries and he explained everything that I needed.  He even followed up with an e-mail and a phone call.  I am very pleased with the treatment that I received.<//text><date>1603148834747<//date>< pics>

At first I was very nervous since I've never invested in gold or any precious metals. Zach Ward guided me and made the process as easy as possible. My anxiety went away as time passes because he has been in contact with me and has given me a sense of confidence. Zach took the time to get to know me and had made my experience feel as though I'm speaking with a close friend. My experience so far has been great and I feel good about the future.<//Text>

Noble Gold set-up a Self-Directed IRA for me and I rolled over funds to Equity Trust in Dec 2019. My Account Manage was Yale who is Friendly, Knowledgeable and a very caring person, IMO. The process was smooth and everything happened just like it was explained to me. Yale was always concerned that all my questions, concerns and issues were dealt with in a timely and friendly manner. Recommend Yale Highly. As with any Investments, do your research and ask all your questions beforehand. Ask for a listing of ALL your fees and have them explained to you and there will be absolutely no surprises. I'm glad I chose Noble Gold.</Text>

<Review>We invested quite a bit of our money with this group and once they get your money, they are next to impossible to reach.  They charged a huge premium for Gold to add to our IRA (+$225 above spot price).  This took weeks to finalize and now they don't return phone calls.  Not sure what happened to this company but right now if you want to sell the gold in your IRA, they are not answering the phone to help.  Extremely disappointing. Colin Plume is all talk.....</Review>< pictures>

<rate>5< /rate><Text>Jerrad at Noble Gold Investments is without a doubt fantastic, thoughtful as well as informative with a contagiously unambiguous demeanor.
Here's why:
I have always been a fact finder. If I don't feel information is correct, I look elsewhere. Since covid, it is clear the news media is not making sense, is biased and causing me to pay close attention to market sentiments as well.
I changed my news source to a truth source some time ago and currently listen to the X22 Report with Dave. I really enjoy his commentary, because I can confirm what he says and he is pleasant to listen too.
It just happens that Noble Gold Investments is one of the advertisements that X22 Report presents. While I used TD Ameritrade (solid company), I could not buy precious metals there, and my gut was saying the stock market could fall..., again.
Now, I'm not the smartest at stocks, but I did know I could secure my current investments with gold, but my knowledge in precious metals investments is not so great.
The other day X22 Reprt showed Noble Gold Investments during one of its ads. I jotted down Noble Gold’s number and made a call to get answers to my seemingly endless questions.
As soon as Jerrad answered, I could hear a clear, precise and comfortable tone in his voice. Immediately,  I couldn’t help but feel the same pleasantness that I have continuously hear in Dave,’s voice in the X22 Report.
I explained to Jerrad what I was currently doing at Ameritrade, buying paper gold (spdr gold shares etf), and proceeded to unleashed my confusion with precious metals purchasing. Jerrad patiently listened to my ramblings and then he literally turned the lights on for me.
He showed me, not only why I would want to buy precious metals, but also Jerrad gave me hypothetical examples and case scenarios to show me why buying precious metals would help save and increase investment value, even if the market took a huge dip, or worse, crashed as it has done in the past.
Jerrad also helped me calculate why, in my case, buying the majority in silver would be my best option for highest return, should gold sharply increase, and to remember, that silver follows gold and has for over 5000 years.
I could endlessly continue on how comfortable Jerrad made me feel during our conversations. We talked about family, business including the stock market history, including where it is headed.
I’m certain Jerrad is aware that It allowed me to see why my 401k is an at-risk investment. That by putting my money into ETF gold shares, albeit affordable, is nothing more than a misnomer that has volatility within the market as with the 401k.
Thank you so much Jerrad with Noble Gold Investments for your sincerity, honesty and compassion for my family’s investment situation and future.<//Text>< Pics>

This was my first time investing in physical metals and stumbled upon Noble Gold while I was doing my research. Charles was very friendly and took the time to explain every step of the way. We ended up rolling over a portion of my 401k into gold and silver. The paperwork and shipment of metals was fast and simple. I'm happy to have done my homework to find this great firm.<//Text>

<Text>I wanted to start a gold IRA account and after doing a bit of research I settled with Noble Gold because they had just what I was looking for -
individually assigned and separately allocated, segregated storage facility. I couldn't have asked for anything more. Truly professional and very satisfied with the terms here especially after discussing details with Collin.</Text>< pictures>

Comparing the financial offerings, fees, and account requirements, and  testing customer support over the phone, including timing responsiveness and helpfulness. The signup process with this provider was easy and they even offer the three most popular types of IRAs (Roth, Traditional, Rollover), and had average fees. Just what I needed as a beginner</text>

Charlse was especially helpful in getting my affairs in order. We had very little understanding of Self Directed IRAs in general and he was extremely patient, answered our many questions with knowledge and enthusiasm, and really sought out what our goals were for reallocating our current portfolio into precious metals. Upon identifying our goals he was able to create a portfolio that matched our desires! I can't recommend Charlse high enough!!< /Review>

Beautiful open space with a large bar top and dance floor. Was here for a night of live music which was enjoyable. Staff was so pleasant. Door guy and bartender were professional and friendly. I had a MEAN manhattan which I highly recommend<//Text>

<review>Nice trendy spot with no cover charge. Small but there are two levels to hang with your friends or man. Great acoustics and the dj plays some fun dance songs. I had the bartender make me something with coconut, cucumber, and mint and man was it delicious, even at $12. Fun spot to drink, hang, and dance.< /review>< user_name>

Swig is a fun club-type atmosphere that seems to cater to the bridge and tunnel folk mostly. if you're in the mood to be starred at and questioned as to why you're there then this is the spot for you. Put on your fancy dress and high-heels and get yourself downtown to Swig.

The contemporary decor seems to keep up to date and thrives as being a sophisticated bar. I think it's lacking in the classy aspect of the word sophistication. Although, the drinks are good and music is fine, there seems to be nothing special or deserving of a 4th star.

When there's a good DJ or live music then it's a better night. Be sure to check it out for your own experience.< /review>

<text>For starters I love the place. What I don’t like is the service. Several times I’ve been there I notice ATTITUDE and rude bar woman. Music is awesome and drinks are great. It works if you can put up with horrible service and attitude you will get from the bar woman. Good luck!</text>< user_name>

Swig is tiny, but it's fun. There's a lively, mixed crowd with mostly young patrons in their 20's and 30's. I like the music they play but the bathroom situation is less than ideal. Either go somewhere else for restrooms, or don't drink so much that you'll need to use it every 30 minutes.< /Review>

Totally fun, unpretentious standby bar near Union Square with a great whiskey selection (a must). Really big welcoming space, but only a few seats here and there. Service is friendly, but not all that fast. They have an upstairs section that overlooks the main floor that you can rent out for private parties. A bonus for me is that they open earlier than the other bars in the area. Don't judge.< /text>

The bar closed earlier than what it said online and I had my drink rudely ripped out of my hands followed by being verbally abused (close to physically) by the bar tender because I was asking questions about the closing hour. Will never go again and would not recommend it to anyone.< /review></record></dataset><record>

A cool little bar in downtown. Came here for the first time in years the other weekend with a friend. Had a few drinks and got our dance on.

While it's not a club and not really a lounge, they have places to chill and also a make-shift area to dance. They had a dj there on this Saturday night.

The place is very well decorated inside. Don't hesitate to dress a little nicer if coming here.< /Review>

Very pretty looking bar, with a cool fireplace on the main floor.  Only a few tables on the main floor, but the upstairs is a great venue for private parties or simply hanging out. The music upstairs is a tad muffled compared to the main area.< /Review>

The drinks here aren't awful, the vibe is kind of fun, but overall, the experience wasn't memorable. We went to Swig briefly, for maybe 30 minutes before my friends and I realized the guy girl ratio was well above 5:1. Not to mention, the level of energy was low, especially for a Friday night.

I'd give this place another shot and definitely wouldn't write it off the list, but didn't have much more than an average time here.< /review>

Came here on a Saturday night with a group of girls. The back room gets a little hot. The service is friendly. Beer selection is excellent. Good place to grab a drink and dance -- it's nothing fancy, there's no cover, and kind of low key which is great! When we left at around 11:30, there was a huge line to get into the place... so I'd recommend coming early to avoid waiting in a line.< /review>

Was there on Tuesday evening. Check at the door by a doorman.

Place looks like there is enough room to dance while you can get drinks at the bar. A small DJ booth in the back.

They have a seasonal menu with some daily specials.

Price is average and the Original Sin I had felt like a sin as it was nice and burning.</text>

{'time': 1520110361092, 'text': "Hi Jan, we are sorry to hear this. RE: yamazaki, it's a highly allocated product and expensive when we can get it so we have to price accordingly. We do carry several other great options of Japanese whisky that fall in the $12-$20 range.\n\nAs for drinks being stolen, it does get busy and we recommend our guests keep an eye on their drink to ensure they are not picked up by someone else by mistake.\n\nIn regards to the staff, we always appreciate feedback and strive to provide superior customer service. We hope you will give us another try and we can make it right!"}<//Response>

Nice bar, BUT one of the bar tenders tried to serve us a cheaper Gin. However one of the bar tenders was great and rectified the situation by subsidising the drinks. Nice bar and drinks in general.<//Text>

The fireplace here is the best on a foggy San Francisco day. Order a golden mojito and cozy up on one of the comfy leather chairs! However, turns into a semi-Eurotrashy dance club on Saturday nights.<//review>

While many other folks seem to dig other speakeasy'ish bars around the area more, I actually prefer Swig.  More space, more chill, less sugary drinks, and I believe their cocktails are lower priced, too.  I really dig the decor and ambiance of this place.<//text>

The doorman , with headphones in, was a total bonehead, but the bar was great and the ambiance was stellar. Sunday night good music priced right, but again the doorman wanted to be somewhere else and I hope next time I visit he is somewhere else.<//Text>

<text>Ok guys, friday you're drunk and want to show yourself on the dance floor, you go up into the room and see the club crowded tight and you stay until closing, but on the rest of the days it's pretty quiet though it doesn't stop to enjoy good cocktails with the appropriate company.< /text>< pics>

They make some stiff drinks and attract an appealing crowd. I wish they had more drinks in their menu and though its a treat to see the bartenders making your drinks with care and skill, a couple of more poeple can surely help fasten the serivce out there.</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<date>1525072055230</date><rate>5</rate><text>(Translated by Google) Original bar with in-house cocktail creations. I was there on a Sunday evening and there was a blues jam session. Approx. 10-12 musicians delighted the audience. This session takes place there regularly. The Swig also stands out from the crowd thanks to the illuminated design of the bar and the fireplace. The cocktails are recommended.

(Translated by Google) Italians, be wary of this place that have HUGE prejudices against Italians. We got a cocktail, paid regularly, we wanted to eat another one and the red-haired girl told us that she would not be able to serve us without specifying the motivation. Obviously I called the Manager who asked us to finish the cocktail and go away WITHOUT EXPLAINING ANYTHING.
They all had a very rude and snooty attitude. Do not give money to these people.

(Original)
Italiani, diffidate di questo locale che hanno ENORMI pregiudizi contro gli italiani. Abbiamo preso un cocktail, pagato regolarmente, volevamo consumarne un altro e ci ha risposto la ragazza dai capelli rossi, che non ci avrebbe più servito senza specificare la motivazione. Ovviamente ho chiamato il Manager che ci ha chiesto di finire il cocktail e andare via SENZA SPIEGARE NULLA.
Avevano tutti un atteggiamento molto scortese e spocchioso. Non regalate i soldi a queste persone.< /Review>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>Worth the drive on a weekend to pick up grilled chicken straight from grill. I come for the mini restaurant inside. Their menu is fully stocked with the traditional tamales, tacos and pozole. The family chicken combo meal is such a steel and way more delicious than the chain restaurants. Easy to spot off the main road. Follow the smoke signal and heavenly aroma. Absolutely recommend.</Review>< pics>

Good food, but careful when the lady at the register charges you. I was charged $45 dollars more and caught it. I hope it was a mistake and not bad intentions.< /Text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Whenever we go to Ventura to visit my son, we look at the roast chickens.
This time we stopped, and we made it to take away, but when we saw that it had no plates, we went back ... I explained that I needed 2 paper plates, showing them the bag that I bought, I answer that they did not have and that they did not give.

The food is good, but the service is not good! .

What do you think?.

(Original)
Siempre que vamos a Ventura a visitar a mi hijo miramos los pollos asados.
Esta ves nos paramos, y la hicimos para llevar, pero al ver que no tenia platos nos regresamos...Les explique que me hacian falta 2 platos de papel, enseñandoles la bolsa que compre, me repondiero que no tenian y que no daban.

La comida esta buena, pero el servicio no es bueno!. .

Ustedes que opinan?.<//Review><userid>109430846184361039112</userid><resp>None< /resp>< Date>

<text>I used this service from my home in Orange County to LAX and then again back from LAX upon my return.  On both trips they were on time, the car was clean and the communication was excellent.  It took me a LONG time to get out of the airport after my flight landed and the driver waited patiently with no issues.  I would use them again without a doubt.</text>< Pics>

<Review>I asked the driver to stop. I didn’t know you had to schedule all stops ahead of time. He got an attitude. To top it off, he said there’s no water bottles because things don’t revolve around me because it’s Covid. Extremely unprofessional. Also he played his music the whole time and the car was hot. I should have taken an Uber.</Review><name>Amara Schertz<//name>< Time>

<user>113005826650341089162<//user><text>After my regular car service closed, I found Executive Car Service. My communications are with Robert who has an amazing customer service. I wish every service I dealt with had Robert's professional service with perfection. I have never felt like I am just another customer. Robert has made me feel as though I am a VIP customer. If you do not believe me, try Executive Car Service!

Reliability: I do not need to call and make sure I am getting to my destination timely. The driver calls me as he is on his way to pick me up.

Cost: I am paying a lot less than with with my prior car service.

All I can say is I do not write reviews unless it is really exceptional and needs to be acknowledged.

THANK YOU EXECUTIVE CAR SERVICE.</text>< time>

I wish I'd known about this company months ago. We just used Executive Car Service for a family vacation flying out and back from LAX. After days of worrying about Uber/Lyft/LAXit or self parking, I stumbled across this company. They are the only way to go. Professional, polite, and competitively priced. Excellent experience with which to start and end our trip.< /Review>

The service was really good from our home to LAX. The driver really understood where to go through the freeways and traffic in a good short amount of time. He was also very helpful with us with the handling of our luggage. I would use this service again when traveling from home to the airport anytime.<//review>

I would highly recommend Executive Car Service LAX.  My drivers Robert (Laguna Beach to John Wayne) and Mylene (LAX to Laguna Beach) were so amazing and so nice.  The cars (BMW X5) were very comfortable, clean and had bottled water for me. Communication was on spot. I was so pleased with our service, I will be using for all my airport transportation. It took the stress and hassle out of dealing with Uber after arriving on an international flight at LAX and going back to OC during Souther Californa rush hour. The peace of mind was worth it!! Thank you again for superb and friendly service. I've already booked my next two trips.</Text>

The car arrived on time, was immaculate, and our driver, Mylene, was a delight. Not only did she get us there safe and sound, but she was an excellent driver as well — and I am not a good passenger!

<review>Unexplained delay to airport pickup, with no contact from driver until 20 minutes after pick up time. Caused us to be 25 minutes late to a business meeting. Might as well have hailed an uber or lyft.

Edit: After bringing up issue to management the company did issue us a full refund for the trip. Management said that they are implementing new protocol to avoid such issues happening. Hopefully the professionalism of the office staff and management can be consistent through to the drivers in the future.<//review><Name>Ariel Legg< /Name>< Resp>

We used Executive Car Service to pick us up in Costa Mesa and take us to LAX.  We also used them when we returned.  I was very impressed by the cleanliness of both vehicles, and it was apparent that the drivers enjoyed what they did.

Our first driver Mark was right on time, and got us to LAX very comfortably and was very pleasant.

Our return driver was Mylene who was also very pleasant and professional.  She was also right there when we got our luggage, so there was not any waiting around for her to show up.  We had a great ride and conversation back to Costa Mesa, and I would definitely request Mylene again to be our driver, and wish we could give her more than 5 stars!

This was the first time we have used Executive Car Service, and will definitely use them again in the future.  I particularly like that you are able to pay at the time of your trip, and to tip as you wish, without any fees being added upfront.</Review>

Use them if YOU WANT to MISS YOUR FLIGHT.

We received couple of reservation confirmation emails on May.14 from Executive Car Service (E.C.S.) for a R/T transportation between Malibu-LAX, starting on Jun.10. 12PM.

On Jun.8, I called the E.C.S. to confirm the reservation; we received a following confirmation email that the company designated a driver for the Jun.10 12pm pickup.

Our experience with other Car Service companies have been that the company made a phone call few hours before our trip followed by a confirmation call by their driver on their way to our house with an estimated approaching time, NOT this company.

Not hearing from them, at 11:50AM, I called the company, was informed that the designated driver's car was broken (without informing us); a substitute driver was on its way, about 40minutes away!
We rejected their service; tried to find a local Taxi, none available at the time, so we jumped in our car and rushed to the LAX; eventually found a parking lot with a free spot (these days, parking lots require a reservation).

Driving to LAX was very stressful because of the time strain; we would had missed our River Cruise boat if missed the flight, consequently a costly trip to reach the boat.  Thanks to the flight delay, we made it, 3 weeks parking at LAX was $385.

This is a very irresponsible company; they care less that they can cause the customer a financial or other type of harms.
AVOID THEM; they are not worth your time or your money.< /Text>

Great service!  Our driver, Mo, was waiting for us when we embarked from our cruise ship in San Pedro.  He was helpful with our luggage and was very friendly.  Our ride to LAX was quick and there wasn't any traffic because this was a Sunday morning.  I can't praise this company and the driver enough for a great experience and reasonable pricing.< /review>

I had the absolute best service today from my ride from Anaheim to LAX.  My driver Robert was extremely professional, courteous and took pride in his service.  He was 15 minutes early called me to let me know and we were off and running.  He was pleasant and we had a great conversation all the way to the airport.  I would recommend him and the service highly and will be using them again in the very near future.

Thank you Robert for your exceptional and professional service today.  Thank you for having an immaculate vehicle and for your friendly service.

I hope to see you again in the near future.

First time using Executive Car Service. Sign up was straight forward and quick.  Rates are very competitive and actually cheaper than Uber in a much nicer vehicle.  Pick up was exactly on time. And my driver Mo was very personal and friendly. No issues and for sure will use again.< /review>

Perfect service! Our driver, Mo, was on time and so nice about answering  questions and adding a stop. Mo gave us great tips regarding future service with this well run service company. We will be back!</Text>

The 1st driver bailed and left with any notice. The replacement driver arrived but I wanted an additional hour at the curb at lax. Also the last ride the driver said if I submitted a review I would get a $10 off on the next ride. When we got to my home the new driver had no record of this.

As a post script not only did they give me the discount but also refunded some money due to the additional wait time. Therefore updating the review. Thanks guys< /Text>

Recently used them to take us to LAX, then from LAX to home. Ironically Nish was our driver and an EXCELLENT one! He was helpful, courteous and kind. On our return from an international flight, there he was, spot on, and on time looking for us in luggage claim.  This is BY FAR the BEST car service and service by Nish we have ever had. We will request him by name the next time we use this EXCELLENT car service. Worth every penny for their excellent customer service! Thank you Nish, you were AWESOME!!!<//review>

<text>Honestly, I was impressed and satisfied with what the barber did for my haircut. Their shop was a perfect choice to visit, for it was clean, stylish, and worth it. Besides, the barber entertained me nicely and properly. Eventually, I concluded that I will continue to ask service in your shop, for you satisfied me a lot. Thanks!<//text>< Pictures>

Great spot, $21 skin fade. They did a hot towel wipe, shoulder massage, and straight razor trim around the neck and ears. Quick in and out spot. Gets the job done.< /Review>

This is a great barbershop for everyone who really wanted an awesome haircut. The barber takes care of our looks. My hairstyle that I really wanted was granted. I looked younger than my hairstyle before. Thank you so much for your good service. Highly recommended.< /text>

<Text>Rick's Barbershop 💈 is the best barbers in San Francisco without a doubt. While visiting the city a friend and mine wanted to go for a fresh cut and we stumbled across Rick's after a lot of research and it is amazing! Ceaser is a really nice friendly barber. So good and the service provided is one of the best I have ever experienced. Would definitely recommend to others. 💯%< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<review>Will absolutely be coming back! A two-chair shop with quick, friendly, and experienced barbers. Great price too, $15 for a cut, $9 for beard. Walked-in with my 3.5 year old son, so they are willing to do kids. They had quite a bit of walk-in and regular business, with almost always some one waiting, but it was hardly noticeable as they work so quickly. Some men were in and out in under 15 minutes with a great cut. Customers all seemed very happy. They end each cut with a neck massage.< /review>< Pictures>

<text>Love these guys.  When you want a haircut and need no frills. Almost always busy.
They purposely don’t take reservations nor answer phone about “is there a wait?”  The reason is simple: it wastes time for them. Plus the answer now may not be true by the time you get there.
Many loyal customers trade the wait for very attractive prices. Count me as one.<//text><date>1530698118322<//date>< response>

I’ve heard that they can have notoriously long lines, but I got there around 8:30 am and was next up.

The guys were friendly and I got a clean mid-fade for $18! Work was done in about 20 minutes and it came with a neck massage at the end.

Can’t beat that price + quality. I’ll definitely be back in a couple of weeks.< /review>< Gmap_id>

<time>1543558924355</time><username>Matthew Shain<//username><review>I asked the barber to use scissors on the side instead of clippers and his response was that he couldn't because he might cut my ears.
Let that sink in.
This guy has been cutting hair for at least 30 years and he doesn't know how to use scissors? Ironically, he finished the haircut with a straight razor...around my ears!
He also only used pruning shears on the top, which is amateur hour if you ask me. There are far better and more effective ways to thin out thick hair.
In the end, it wasn't not the worst cut I ever got, and my ears weren't cut, but it certainly was a hatchet job. I guess you get what you pay for. I won't be back.<//review>< rate>

<Review>The barber named Caesar cut my hair and he gave me a high-and-tight fade when I specifically asked for a low-fade AND showed him a picture of what a low-fade looks like just to be safe.  Now I look like a jarhead Marine and will have to tell people to stop thanking me for my service when I walk around SF for the next month while it grows back out.  Never again Caesar! Never again!<//Review><GmapID>0x808587111cc4d76f:0xbbfdefef7a496b0< /GmapID>< Rating>

At $14 you can't expect too much. They do simple cuts and you'll wait in line for it unless you arrive early. The work is slightly rushed and the detail isn't the same as a $40 barber. The cuts are pretty simple and more for people without much hair (most of the clientele).

Cesar bought the place from his brother Rick in the 90's but never changed the name.< /Review>

<Review>This is my local gym and has been for a few years. The staff is so awesome and the vibe is always good here! They have a great combination of equipment that totally suits all of my workouts . Is it the fanciest or cleanest gym out there ? No it isn't but this is the type of gym where goals and lives change at! I live the same distance away from this gym and the one on curtner / Almaden and will always choose this gym any day.  Better equipment,  nicer workers , better crowd! I appreciate you guys so much ! Thank you for being the place that I can make my dreams come true!</Review></record></dataset><record>

They did a major renovation about 10 years ago,  it would seem they need to use this time while they are closed to do another through cleaning. I’ll give them 3 stars because they are in a great location; and hopefully they will go back to being a 24 Hour facility...< /Review><response>None</response>< user>

Great sized gym, lots of good equipment. It definitely gets busy but there are a lot of options.   They have a pool, sauna and even a basketball court.

The class variety and instructors are excellent. It’s awesome 24 allows you to take them for free.

Personal trainers are available, they make sure not to interfere with members if you have not signed up for them.

Good variety of healthy snacks up front too.  This is definitely my favorite 24 location.</review>

The Gym is not exactly the cleanest thing on Earth but it offers a very wide selection of equipment. The 5 stars though go pretty much exclusively to Larry, the personal trainer that I’ve had at this gym. He took his responsibilities very seriously, was very knowledgable regarding what exercises to do and how to them correctly and was always on time. I would definitely recommend him to anyone who wants to get quality personal training sessions!<//text>

I think the the price/quality ratio of this place is good. Considering the space, group class offerings, number and variety of machines, friendliness of staff, I am willing to overlook some shortcomings (like the cleanliness of the gym floors and water fountains). I applaud the management for keeping the gym open during holidays and letting members work-out on those days when many businesses are closed (clearly the gym does not make extra money staying open - it is just an extra cost). So overall I am very pleased and I recommend it to my friends.<//review>

Locker room floors are constantly wet and the staff requires you to check out the tricep rope because someone 'stole' an extremely used one that was over due for being replaced. In honesty it was probably thrown away because it was so worn out. All this trouble for a $20 item. You'd think we were paying enough?</Text>

<Review>I went to this location to check out the 24 fitness for the first time by using 3 days free pass. When I registered with front desk (Michelle), she asked me where do I live. I live in different city but this gym is the closest one to my home. She then said she needs to check with her manager because I live in a different city, but go to San Jose 24 fitness. I don’t know why she did that while the free pass says I can go to any location. Maybe I am an Asian and using the free pass, so she gives me a hard time! I was not happy about it.< /Review>< user_id>

<text>I've been a member here for many years and am at the point where I think change is necessary. This gym is a dirty place and you can tell that the management has been neglecting it for a long time now. The bathrooms are disgusting. There is mold and scum everywhere. Sandals are a must as I feel direct contact with the floor in the locker room could lead to illness. The pool and hot tub area has deteriorated to an all time low. The sauna and steam room have pungent odors. The membership here is cheap but I feel you could find better value at other gyms. Beware.< /text><Gmap_id>0x808e34660d14f913:0xad57ae124747f0dc</Gmap_id></record>

I was trying to take a dive into the pool but the walkway was so slippery on that narrow path. I wore my sandals. I fear i could trip and fall into the pool.

So I decided to use elliptical machine. The trip back to locker room was horrific. Dirty floors between men's shower room and wet area. It's like mildew ate the walls.</Text>< gmapID>

<text>Unfortunately, this club has deteriorated to a level where I feel it has crossed the boundary into a public health risk. The shower tiles are covered in scum and mold is present in many areas on the shower door frames. At times, the pool is so full with chemicals that the water is cloudy and the fumes pungent. Last week I had to report a spin bike that had a pedal so close to snapping off that it could have broken a person's ankle. Staff turnaround is extremely high lending me to believe it is not a very nice place to work.

I would recommend that 24 Hour Fitness executives (who are based in San Ramon) visit and compare it to their San Ramon or better yet, Seattle clubs. Hillsdale has truly become a dump and a blight on the 24 Hour brand. There is a difference between managing costs and cutting corners. This club is either deserving of investment or shuttering.

Overall.. it is dirty and dangerous. Dont take my word though. Take a look for yourself.< /text>< Time>

<Review>One of the best 24 fitness gyms. Other ones in the area suck! So even though this one is pretty far away - I still go here because its so much nicer. It sucks that the chain cant make all 24 fitnesses nice or at least with a towel service because its super inconvenient to bring so many towels with you and wash and dry them at home all the time. Anyways - this Gym is clean, staff is friendly, 2 different saunas - pretty good vibe. I come there almost every day. I recommend this one for everybody!<//Review><Response>None<//Response>< pics>

If I could I would pick zero star for this place.

worst place ever.

super hard to cancel the membership.

the staff there cannot help and the manager is too arrogant to help.

it took me two visits and 4 calls to finally cancel it.

I would recomment never go there< /Review>

Been going to this gym six hours a week for nearly a year now and this is my observations:

Pros:
- Location is good - I enjoy having other gyms to work at when I travel.
- Staff is very nice and friendly
- Never had a trainer, but have met a few and they seem knowledgeable and nice
- Most of the regulars are very friendly and nice

Cons:
- This is the least kept place in all the 24 hour fitness gyms I've been to
- The gym culture does not have very good gym etiquette:  weights are never put back correctly, people will take weights off your rack while you are working out without asking
- People must walk out with the small weights; I spend 5 to 10 minutes a work out session searching for weights that I need
- I have never seen the staff clean up, re-rack weights, or generally keep up after the place
- The mens locker room always seems dirty< /review>

Not the worst one, but there are better sports out there. This place is in need of a renovation. In general, it's not as clean and the environment is outdated. It could be bigger. The locker room is pretty disgusting.< /Review>

Great people there they go out of there way to know there members names and encourage them to keep coming and understanding. Other members are also great. I am a big guys but since i join i almost lost 100 lbs . But best part about the gym is the wet area. The only negative thing yo say is that the guys who is in charge of keep the equipment in top shape is over worked and if something goes down while he is not there it take a while to fix it. Highly recommend this gym< /text>

In my opinion, this is by far one of the better 24 Hours... I say that because it is clean and I can tell the staff is working hard to keep it that way. I cannot say the same for other locations (in fact I’d say that some have really grossed me out & I would rather change in my car than the locker room). Thank you to the Almaden team for giving me a good place to workout while I am away from my normal gym.</text>

This facility seems terrific. Steven provided an excellent tour--pool, sauna, steam, jacuzzi, tons of classes, basketball court, plenty of equipment, free weights, its open 24 hours-  just avoid peak times. Costco 2-year at 399 (16.50/ mo)definitely considering it< /Review>

I have been a member here for about a year before I cancelled. The staff does not greet people and rarely even pays attention to who comes into the gym. The gym is dirty and there is mold in the men's locker room and shower. Pool water is also quite dirty. Be cautious, this place is a health hazard.<//text>

<Text>This is the worst gym ever. It's overly crowded and the gym itself is dirty. It could be better but they don't have enough staff to keep up with how many people use the facility. The gym isn't big enough for the every everyone to use comfortably. The classes start at inconvenient times and the worst part of all is how unorganized the staff is. You pay extra for the kids club but don't even get to use it in weekends. Their favorite quote is, "Our kids club employee called in sick." The truth is they don't have enough staffing for kids club and they continue to lie to us. You pay extra to have the kids club available and don't even get to use it when they're supposed to be open. It's completely frustrating. This gym and staff are complete unreliable. I'm looking for a new gym membership somewhere else.< /Text>< Pics>

<Review>Been going to 24 hour locations since I moved to CA four years ago, and this was by far the worst I’ve been to. Lots of old and broken machines, the layout makes it really hard to get around without getting in peoples way, janky locker rooms, and there was like no air flow so it was suuuper sweaty in there. The place is really due for an upgrade</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

I guess I came early in the weekend morning, that's why it was very clean everywhere especially women's locker rooms aan bathroom shower area, which is nice compare to other location,  but I might be wrong if come at other hours.< /Text>

Some disturbing regulars from a guy who basically wore revealing underwear to work out and a guy who looks homeless and always smells like a dumpster. Dumbbells are never in order and weights are scattered. People tend to chat while on a machine and take their time to share the machine. No towel service.

I have not checked out the pool area or attended any classes but it's nice they are available.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

Equipments not any worse than other places like golds and the hours are great.  But they need to do something about the man named Kenneth  Who is always cruising the men's showers and bathroom . He does  obscene  things in the men's room  and in the parking lot in his white Mazda SUV with other men from The Gym
Its gross and he needs to be stopped</Review>

This club has everything. Pool, jacuzzi, suana, steam room plus a bike room, a basketball court and a room for classes like pilates, core, yoga. Make sure u lock your stuff in a locker or keep it with u as theft in the locker rooms is common occurrence.</text>

<user>114972008609622917907<//user><Text>Eh. Not well maintained and very outdated. This is a high volume gym and the cleaning schedule does not keep up with the demand, so it is a bit dirty. Staff is hit or miss and it is over priced.

It's been a year and things are WORSE. The creepy guys in their UNDERWEAR  troll the pool area to case women. Shower area was not cleaned in a WEKK -- I know because I saw an empty shampoo bottle on the shower floor for a week. Cameras are not allowed in the worst part of the gym so it's impossible to show the disgusting and broken shower area in the womens bathroom.

This place was the elite club 20 years ago. Now, it's just a public dump.</Text><Gmap_id>0x808e34660d14f913:0xad57ae124747f0dc</Gmap_id><response>None</response><Name>Melody Jane<//Name><time>1541594989774<//time><pictures>None</pictures></record></dataset><record>

I have been using 24 hour off and on for years. I have not been very happy with the Hillsdale location. It seems like no one cares and if you raise a concern you get the stink eye. No WIFI, equipment is all breaking down and you cant find a parking spot very easy. I was laid off and I have been trying to cancel for three months. I get the run around around everytime I go in. Now I feel like they are scamming me. When I get work again it wont be 24 hour that I come back to!< /text>

Update.Here is Corperate phone number (  ) and The Health Departments phone number (  ) I'm told the managers name is Nicole. She should not be hired. This is not a sales store. I came 7 times to join during sales hours and was not assisted. I ended up driving 18 miles round trip to the Almaden Road branch to join to go to the Hillsdale branch.
==
Members should add/upload pictures of the filthy facility, broken equip, etc No staff 4 walk through. No communication from desk @setting appointment, comming another time. Remember GOOGLE 3 day FREE PASS try it.. so far thinking the facilty is for the wrong side of town.< /review>

Ugh what to say, ive been going here since I was about 13 or 14 and im 21 now, but my main 24 gym I visit is on Parkmoor mainly because it doesn't get as crowded especially from 3 - 7 pm which is the worst! Also, it gets soo hot at this gym the humidity from all the sweat feels gross. If you intend to visit this 24, come from 9pm - 7am this is the best time with low occupancy.< /text>

<review>$20 to use their gym for a day!  Wowzah!!!  And then the hard sales and hoops I had to cross over just to enter the mad house for the day lol.
I want a membership where there's people, but this is way too many people in one place at one time for me!

I also agree with other reviewers in that this place is over it's capacity.

Attempted to do the evening Zumba class, but there were a zillion people in there, so close to eachother, that it was uncomfortable.

I will not return.

Staff was friendly and they have a great selection of machines and classes.<//review>< pictures>

I am pissed off with this trainor name Danniel today he wanted me to get a membership for my first day trial for a 3 days pass after I told him I am member 3 yrs ago. And I told him I would like to try the 3 days trial first. But then he said I need to pay $20 and I can't use the 3 days pass because I am a member long time ago. So I walk out..< /Review>

Gross. Music (with ads!) always too loud. Pro is that it's cheap and the equipment is decent.</Text>

Fitness manager Danny Page has the audacity to verbally abuse club members. Especially to women. The "fitness" manager is not fit for the job. DANNY PAGE is the most arrogant person. DANNY PAGE will humiliate you in front of other members. A very Traumatic experience with this guy DANNY PAGE. Managers Nicole and Marisa are unable to address and will tolerate his unacceptable demeanor.< /text>

Clean gym for the most part. Suana, steam room and pool options. Plus it's next to Target :)< /review>

For some reason the ventilation here is really terrible. I feel it's 5-10 degrees warmer inside than outside during all of my visits.<//text>

<review>The first gym i went to in san jose had 40-50 dumbbells on the ground and it was the hardest thing to find matching dumbells. So i called their customer service line to switch my membership to another location which was a lot nicer. When i got there i was impressed with the gym but when i went to scan my card it was invalid and the fat man at the counter wouldn't let me in. I asked him if i could just work out that night and come back in the morning to speak with a representative cause i lived 20 minutes away. I was treated like a high school kid as if i was trying to scam a free workout and it was embarrassing in front of other members that were standing nearby. So I called that same location in the morning and told them my story and how i was irritated at the man the previous night. They switched my membership over to that location and said i was good to go. When i went in the next time (which was the following week) my card came up as canceled!!! The same fat man from the previous visit was a complete dick again and would not look up the problem in the computer and said there was nothing he could do. I spent 100 dollars on that membership for 3 months before moving back out of state and with all the trouble i trying to get in and workout was maybe 6 times. So i spent around 20 dollars a workout. Such a horrible experience. Go spend your money elsewhere. Lifetime fitness in arizona was one of the most amazing experiences ever (although double the cost). I have had memberships at ymca and LA fitness. I would recommend any of those before 24 hour fitness.< /review><rating>1< /rating>< resp>

It's a gym, I wish they update the machines from time to time. I find I go here because it's close to home, but I like the Willow Glenn gym better.<//text>

Not very well maintained. All outdated equipment.

And it always pisses me off when literally none of the headphone jacks work on any of the cardio machines... I'm trying to watch some Sportscenter!</Review>

<Date>1603839556161< /Date><text>(Translated by Google) There are not many exercises that can be done in the aftermath of the coronavirus.
I signed a one-year contract for exercise in the GX room, but the money is withdrawn every month, so I have to exercise, but I do not operate the GX room and are only doing fitness.

<Text>Ok listen. The DC my freshman year (2017-18) wasn't great. It was about mediocre buffet quality. But theyre under new management as of fall 2018 and the quality has improved IMMENSELY!!! There's much more variety and much more edible food than there was last year! And they have fresh infused water, which I love. They're learning what the students like and dislike and using it to improve. Kinda stingy about taking food out...

<text>I wanted to try what my kid is eating at the school campus dining hall. The food wasn't that great. The servers were the college students and seems like it was a chore for them. I feel for the kids. I'm  a parent who pays for their meals on campus and they can also use the meal cards to eat fast food. Both are unhealthy. No good choices.</text>< pics>

<Text>Filthy, the cashiers never know how to charge gold points, and manager Kevin seems unconcerned and argumentative about the lack of ADA compliance. Currently having expected health issue from his negligence. Used my "going up stairs" for the day on the small steps near the ada elevator and he sent me around to use the long stairs because I wasn't in a wheel chair and had not used the lift. Would not answer the question of what does he do if someone is in a wheelchair. Told me I should have used the lift in the residence hall... I do not live in the residence hall. Combative ableist rude...I hope he enjoys making life harder for people, because he is really good at it. He needs training on all disabilities not just the ones he can see.

ETA: just went to the coffee counter asked for a mocha, the person taking the order was not speaking clearly, could barely hear him, the person making the drinks hitched his foot up on the counter to tie his shoe. Order taker came over to help, spilled coffee all over the pick up counter and they both just left it there. And he held a cup of someone's order up to his nose to smell what it was... Lovely.< /Text><GmapID>0x808fccc7f334858d:0xd32f7dcecae2c209<//GmapID><UserId.>105327353472742194397</UserId.><rating>1<//rating></record>

Overall fairly decent food. Large variety, but average quality. Think Hometown Buffet. Their on the go burritos are the best and quick to grab. (That is, if you avoid the after class student traffic)</Text>

<Rating>2</Rating><Text>Food is on a schedule but can get very repetitive. They do have good desert. The sushi is good, probably because it's made by an outside company.
The cheese and toppings on the pizza slides off.
Some of the salad bar vegetables sit out the whole day and are dried up or expired.
Don't eat the hotdogs, they are recycled everyday.
The fruit in the front, usually aren't stocked or have been there for a few days.
On weekends the bare minimum is done for food and not everything is stocked or cleaned.
The busiest time is between 10 am and 3 on.
The tables arent cleaned until the end of the day usually.
I hope you don't get offended by hip hop songs littered with curse words because they will blast it from behind the counter.
Hope this helps.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>{'time': 1554237382708, 'text': 'Hi Bryceton, Have you heard the Commons is under new management? Swing by and give us another try?'}<//response><gmap_id>0x808fccc7f334858d:0xd32f7dcecae2c209< /gmap_id></record>

I love this place! There is always a high variety of food here from an Asian Cuisine, to a Latin location similar to chipotle, there is a deli and a location called off the map that has food from around the world. It has a coffee place, a Jamba Juice and a pizza/pasta place. This isn't including the 4 salad bars the wide variety of drinks and the fact that the hours are so long that you really can go at any time of the day. All this and the building just got a face life making it look so much nicer than previous years!</Review>

<text>Update March 26th 2019: I'm actually going to recommend this place as not only a quick-bite but a decent value for students. My change in tone comes down to one drastic change in policy from previous ownership: to-go boxes.

You can purchase to-go boxes which are reusable and washable. They're a great add on to the value of a meal plan which it seems like they're also changing for the coming fall semester.

Also as I figured the food and ridiculous wait times have since the grand opening settled down, and the food quality has made a leap in quality since the past few years. I'm not sure whether this has to do with new management or a shift from completely relying on student labor to hiring more full-time staff, but they've definitely changed things for the better.

TL;DR It's college food, you can live with it. They serve you the food portioned, but you can good back as many times as you want.  Disappointing remodel.

I've been eating here for 3 years now. In that time, I have worked there for 1, and more recently seen a complete restructure of the service in the most recent academic year (2018-2019).

Let me get this bit out of the way first: it's WAS an on campus cafeteria with primarily students working the kitchen. So yes the food isn't the greatest, but it's edible and can say (believe it or not) a good chunk of the main entrees are prepared fresh. The taste is definitely a hit or miss, but despite a monthly food rotation cycle it gets old fast.

Now I all caps'd "was" because the year I worked there was my first year, and as I mentioned they are no longer run by Spartan Shops. As a result one of the main reasons to actually eat here being the Jamba Juice is gone. In fact a lot of things have been reorganized.

The gluten free kitchen was removed for whatever reason 2 years ago (I know a couple of friends who actually well... CAN'T EAT GLUTEN and were pretty upset when it was removed). Yes they offer gluten free options but for those of us who remembers it's not nearly as satisfying.

The recent remodel currently doesn't have the ice cream machines anymore, there's no more dedicated stand to order coffees, and the cold bar is lacking the variety it had in previous years.

But to their credit, what's left of the relocated desserts bar looks better, there's a wider variety of spices available, and they've added a coffee machine in lieu of the separate stand for ordering it.

Okay I'm stretching quite a bit, and hopefully over time they improve since it seems like they're still in the process of hiring and getting all. the stations setup but until then, it seems this new "Spartan Dining Experience" has turned into more of the same generic food you can find at every other CSU.

I would bring Santa Barbara, Berkeley students, even SJSU alumni and they would be impressed by the DC, because in the past years we really did have it better off than other campuses. Now? I'm not so sure.

Have a meal plan and are dissatisfied with what they  have? Assuming the policy hasn't changed with the new company, in the first few weeks you can always downgrade your plan. I'm considering it, and am hoping it's still an option.

Not that many people would care but I will update this review as and if needed...<//text><username>Carlo del Mundo< /username>< rating>

<username>Tamara Turner</username><text>When I went in, it was a wreck. It is in serious need of more staff or better management. It has a decent variety. Coffee specialties, Jamba juice, salad bar, sandwich station, mexican and Asian food counters. $10 breakfast, $12 lunch and $13 for dinner. WAY too high! It might be worth it if it they had a little pride in it and it was seriously cleaned up.<//text></record>

<text>Horrible. At the price I pay, I expect decent food. Everything is just oily and fatty. The only healthy things there are the fruit but the only thing they offer is cantaloupe and honey dew. Every. Single Day. There are no bowls when you want cereal or soup. There are no cups when you want orange juice in the morning. I'm paying $50 per day for this.

<Text>I do not like the food here either. It is very disappointing that this is what we are served when paying for a meal plan. Are we in high school or college? If you want to diet and get on a healthy grind, say no to that. The food is all processed and then only thing that is healthy is the salad bar. Very sad.

<Review>Upon entering this establishment for the first time, I fell under the false assumption of this cafeteria being satisfactory, if not rather extraordinary. However, this facade soon ended, after about a week of decent satisfaction, nothing would've prepared me for what was to come next.

The food available decided to spontaneously contract bipolarism, on some days the food is adequate at best. But, its the other days that I've been warned of. Too many times.

I came in, it was a Tuesday morning, looking for a decent breakfast. I go to get some some eggs, scrambled, as they usually are. Upon first inspection, they seemed fine, but as soon as the yellow fluffy bird-fetus made contact with my taste buds, my eyes squinted, my nose flared, and everything seemed to contract inward. For what I tasted was not egg. No... what I tasted was false hopes and dreams, false promises and legends of true happiness, only to be hit by the bitter truth, like a flame-fisted semi truck hitting my face at high speeds.

So, no. The dining commons is not a good establishment. The opposite actually.

I will leave you with one last story.

Once I wanted to relieve myself, as most would. I entered the mens bathroom, and went to the urinal. But before I could relieve myself, I looked down at the urinal, or atleast what I thought was the urinal. But instead, all I saw was the large disembodied head of Ewan Mcgregor, mouth open awaiting my urine. I proceeded to run away.<//Review><name>Thomas Watkins<//name>< userid>

<Date>1433803029372< /Date><rating>5<//rating><text>Awesome place to eat with friends, especially if you live on campus. Only bad thing is the cleanliness, it is a tough place to maintain because of the high traffic. Other than that, if one is not a spoiled rich brat the food is great, can have as much as one wants, all you have to do is get back in line which is 6 feet away from the table. There is always places to sit, only time it is crowded is when big games are playing, but that is the best time because it is like going to a bar except without the alcohol. I will say it is rather pricey, but, hey they have everything one needs, all day omelets, pizza, jamba juice, a café, sushi, pretty much anything one can think of and they always change it up as well. If you do not like the food here, you obviously have your own personal chef at home who gets paid amazingly and or you are an amazing cook. Lastly the employees are always friendly and if when they aren't just cut them some slack, 90% are students, and for almost 95% it is their first job.
Honestly the DC is somewhere I would go if I am starving and want to end up full and happy.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

<rate>5< /rate><text>Fabulous! The visit here was exceptional! I ordered the waffle and chicken benedict with diced potatoes on the side. The presentation of the plate was superb and the flavors were incredible! I would highly recommend giving this family owned baker/cafe a try! The pastries are also fantastic and go well with the delicious coffee. The dinning area was well maintained, the staff was very friendly professional and welcoming! The parking was a breeze and the wait time for the food to arrive after order was reasonable 😊</text>< pictures>

This bakery is family owned and operated. With staff that is always friendly and doing their best to allow you and your loved ones to feel comfortable and enjoy yourselves. This place is a staple of the community with food that is ALWAYS top notch, bakery items that are above and beyond always, and care given to every customer. If you see a line, it's worth the wait. I can NOT tell you how much this little bakery means to my little family. They know our faces, they've learned our names, they've earned our trust. This. Place. Cant. Be. Beat.</Text>

<Review>I had an iced vanilla latte, and a pecan twist. Both were delicious. I got my daughter the Avocado Toast. She said it tasted good. This item seemed a bit pricey for the serving amount.</Review>< pics>

<user>107436176122180821823</user><Text>This may be one of the best bakeries I've eaten at. I really do mean that. I've eaten at bakeries around the world. From New Zealand to Japan and from England to Vietnam and this one really pulls it off.

I think the key part of a good Bakery is being able to pull off a delicious crusty crust while keeping a soft chewy mid. This Bakery Aces that task and all the pastries I've tried there have so far surprised the heck out of me.

Also, they have a great breakfast menu!</Text>< Rating>

My sister's favorite breakfast/brunch place in Oceanside. She had me try their lavendar lattes! It was SO good. Great service. I went on a Wednesday and they had great service & food was incredible.< /review>

I stumbled across this place primarily because the usual spots had huge lines.  What a pleasant surprise!  The breakfast was excellent and the cappuccino perfectly prepared.  If you're in the area give it a try, I'll definitely be going back to try some of the pastries !  They looked delicious!< /text>

Hands down, the best bakery in Socal! We come here every time we visit Oceanside, CA. Highly recommend the California benedict or the chicken and waffles benedict. Their cheesecakes are perfection!!! NY or Chocolate turtle, you can't go wrong.<//text>

My favorite breakfast place ever, for almost 10 years I've been going. Best service and best food! Today, one of the staff members recognized me by name after coming back a year later! Oceanside is nothing without this place ❤️❤️< /review>

<text>This place is absolutely delicious 😋Lots of options when it comes to food and desserts! The only thing I didn’t like was the wait time to get our breakfast. There was only about three tables before us and we ended up waiting over 30 minutes. But other than that detail everything was great!</text>< pics>

Since arriving in Oceanside, CA 4 days ago, I have eaten five meals at Petite Madeline. Today it is cold and rainy, so I have spent the whole day here working, eating breakfast and lunch, savoring delicious Mexican Mocha and enjoying the gracious staff, as well as, the company of other enthusiastic patrons. Highly recommend this cafe/bakery/restaurant/coffee bar.</Text>

The only bad thing about this place is they are closed 2 days out of the week. One other thing too is they use whipped cream for the eclairs not the custard :/
But otherwise great.< /review>

<Text>Got to be the closest thing to a French bakery I’ve had in the US. The pastries are flaky but moist and have just the right amount of sweetness without being overpoweringly sweet. Plus, the bakery is locally owned and the staff are extremely professional and kind.

Fresh, savory, sweet, delicious. My daughter said the strawberry Nutella crepe was better than the ones she ate in Paris. I tried a daily special: ham and butternut squash hash. I could eat that every. Single. Morning. 👏🏼👏🏼< /Text>

The only bad thing about this place is they are closed 2 days out of the week. One other thing too is they use whipped cream for the eclairs not the custard :/
But otherwise great.< /text>

By the way, our eclairs, actually, have both a layer of house made pastry cream aka custard, and real whipped cream for double goodness. We hope to see you again!'}</response>

The food here is really delicious. Plus, the atmosphere is amazing with super chill staff. This is where I come to on my day off to just relax and think. It's definitely one of the best bakeries in the Oceanside area bar none.<//Review>

Great locally produced on tap kombucha. Fine selection of desserts and pastries. Nice and chill place, good for a quick drink/treat. I've been on two separate occasions while visiting Oceanside, and I'd recommend it as a stop for anyone in the area.< /Text>

<rate>5< /rate><text>Petite Madeline has become a mainstay of authentic local cuisine. An eclectic menu caters to an ethnically diverse local population hungry for everything from beef brisket, to salmon, prosciutto and freshly prepared mozzarella, French Nicoise salad, omletts, and bakery treats... to name just a few. The ambiance is coastal casual, while the prices are far less than you'd expect for a restaurant 5 minutes walking distance from the beach!< /text>< Pics>

Stopped by for breakfast midweek and was pleasantly surprised with the quick service and generous portions. The bakery is right next to the Thursday farmer's market too which was nice.</Review>

<Text>Such a fabulous breakfast experience for two adults and two small children. There were so many choices but we each ordered something different and our plates were clean, our stomachs full, and it was fun to talk about what we just ate. Everyone was nice and we had several conversations with the waitress and hostess. We will return for dessert sometime, again, so much to choose from.</Text>< Pictures>

We were traveling for the weekend so we stocked up on goodies. The peach pastry had crust that was light and flaky. The peanut butter cookie is a cross between a light sugar cookie and a peanut butter cookie. Best of all is the Meltaway, a shortbread cookie that is light and it melts in your mouth. The bakery clearly uses top quality ingredients. We highly recommend this bakery.</text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

<Name>Apex Chaser</Name><text>Truly fantastic experience! Insanely nice staff. True food service professionals. The espresso was well prepared, milk foamed to perfection(they use a lighter flavor profile of espresso). The California Benedict is fabulous! The hollandaise is obviously fresh made from scratch, rich and delicate. The english muffin was chewy and crunchy in all the best ways! This is a spot that knows food and puts love into what they're doing,  can't reccomend them strongly enough!<//text><user_id>116384679432013832648<//user_id><Pictures>None</Pictures><gmap_id>0x80dc6e373abbee59:0xdf826bd2ff444f86</gmap_id><Rate>5</Rate><time>1582479970885</time>< response>

Awesome food but expect a wait and under par service. I mean the staff look like good people but are running around too busy to help anyone coming thru the door. Seems like business is good regardless so I suggest hiring out more staff or consulting someone to help with operations and customer service. Definitely cool spot but I felt as though I was more of a nuisance for choosing this place instead of a welcomed customer where staff are ready to serve and fulfill customer needs.

There was a point to my visit when I was denied being sold a cup of coffee. It was just going to be simple, I mean I drink it black, nothing special. **Sadness<//review>

Excellent cafe with a semi-new age menu. House specialty and regular menu items are uniformly good. Don't sit near the pastry display or your diet will suffer from frustration. Try to avoid great beach weather days as the foot traffic goes sky high and with some restrictions still in place, lines may form outside  (indoor dining is now possible). Then again,  if you get a table by the windows the people watching is also great.</Text>

This place is a hidden gem and trust me it's not hidden.   Fantastic coffees, delicious pastries and baked goods but that's not all they have.  Full breakfast menu and lunch. Smiles everywhere, even when they first open and coffee hasn't kicked in yet, they're smiling.  Ownership here does it right.   Great place.< /Text>

<Text>I wandered in one beautiful day shortly before closing to eye the bakery and assess whether my husband and I should stop in for breakfast. We will...definitely! The single serving cheesecakes were works of art and staff was most helpful.  Leaving with an additional coconut macaroon (GF!) I enjoyed relaxing by the Oceanside library fountain just across Coast Hwy 1 from the entrance.  Our cheesecake made a lovely dessert for two. Reasonably priced; really does taste ‘from scratch’.</Text>< Pictures>

<text>I hate ordering my food in line.
But my food came out and it was barely warm and the cafe wasn't busy.
My friend ordered an omelet and I guess they screwed up her omelet.
The pastries were good and the interior is cute.< /text><rate>3</rate><Pictures>None</Pictures></record>

Overall the food and vibe was great, they even had toys to entertain the little one. It did seem as though they were understaffed since the wait to order was longer than expected. After a while of being there my husband also tried to order a coffee, and they said they weren't taking any orders for an hour.< /Text>

<Review>I really like the pastries here they are quite delicious, but I feel like they kind of jack the prices just because they're downtown. there's a place on Mission Avenue next to the police station that is just as delicious but a tad more reasonable. They have my business now.</Review>< Pics>

Just on corner of main Street, a busy and quality little bakery and restaurant. The staff was most helpful and family loved the delicacies we're enjoyed in our beach front rental. Walking distance to the Pier. Small town feel! Never had a bad time in Oceanside!<//text>

I had the special, so not a normal menu item. It was pretty good. What I personally liked best was getting my coffee mocha in a real cup. So few places do that without asking. And for me it enhances the experience of sitting down to have a drink. Thanks!</Review>

I don’t often order an omelette. For me, that’s usually only the safe choice when I can’t find anything truly appealing. 99% of omelets are scrambled eggs with mediocre ingredients. But for some reason, I was intrigued by the offering at Petite Madeline.

First off, to set the stage, I was ravenous after just completing a long run. Sunday morning post-run breakfast for me is more like an attack by a wild animal than typical human dining. So apologies to the staff if I left a mess ;)

The omelette arrived and immediately it appeared different than what I’m used to. The egg was delicately folded - more like the dough of a croissant than the typical globular mess of most omelettes. There was a generous portion of the ingredients atop the whole thing and more within. The sausage was absolutely perfect. Full flavored and moist but not the typical acrid assault on the taste buds from cheap breakfast sausage. The goat cheese was perfectly tart and prolifically distributed. Add in spinach and onions, and this was one delightfully flavorful (and filling) meal.

The coffee was also excellent. My girlfriend had a delicious oatmeal bowl that I envied in silence.

Why 4 and not 5 stars? I reserve 5 stars for mind blowing experiences. This was very good and highly recommended. But it’s not in my top three favorite breakfast places, and I have to draw the line somewhere.</Text>

Excellent pastries - very good sandwiches and salads. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Variety of seating from friendly community table to cozy booths or tables for two. Park on street out front. So comfortable I come in 3 or 4 times a week all winter long when I'm in town.< /Text>

Whether you need a fresh baguette for dinner, pastries for the office meeting, or a place to delight out of town visitors, they have you covered! If that is not enough of a draw, their wedding cakes are divine, and make the testing and ordering process so easy for a bride! My husband and I are still talking about the cake and we got married in February. Top noch!<//Review><user>112531879765058948905<//user>< GmapID>

If somebody orders and almond milk in anything make sure you do not put cow's milk!!! Totally made me sick on my last morning in Oceanside. They seem to have gotten flustered bye two of us and a group of four that walked in moments apart that was when the mistake was made. It seemed to me that they should be very clear on these kinds of things when speaking to each other. This was a huge deal and totally ruined my entire day.< /review>< Name>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>I stopped here with my husband, sister, and my 4 kids age 1-10yrs.The food was wonderful and everyone completely finished their meal, even my 2 yr old with problems swallowing from a tongue-tie. Everyone genuinely enjoyed their meal and I can't remember the last time we ate out with the kids and didn't need a to-go box. The place was adorable, the service was great, and the servers were kind and helpful when my over hungry toddler got upset for a while. We were visiting from out of town but I would love to make it back here.</Review></record></dataset><record>

Friendly staff and easy parking. Pastries are made fresh daily and espresso drinks are very good, much better than popular chain coffee houses. Decor is trendy, but the building is old. Great spot for a quick coffee and snack.< /text>

<Rating>3</Rating><text>Don't get their strange specials because they are designed to be strange rather than delicious. The food isn't very exciting. Besides the weird specialty of the day, it's generally only expected breakfast items. They don't have Madeleines to order. I was hoping for a more French experience. The location is good, but there's a crepe place across the street that delivers French cuisine and attitude way better than this place.< /text>< Pics>

Petit Madeline is super comfy, never too loud, and has always had excellent service. Their coffee and tea are tasty and reasonably priced. They also have a huge array of creative pastries and mini cheesecakes, and a light lunch selection. There's lots of seating so it's a great place to meet family, have a study group, or just relax with a book.</review>

The pastries are bland and not authentic, if that's what you're searching for. I was on the hunt for some decent crepes, croissants and pastries and did not find that here. Rather disappointed in the food, not sure what the hype is about here. Not too bad of sandwiches, but for a place that advertises itself as 'French' I was hoping for a bit more of a selection and authenticity.<//review>

I've been there before and gave 5 stars.
The breakfast sandwich today was a little skimpy and greasy. It's out of the way for me to go there, but my friends and I make a point to go there when we're near there.< /text>

<review>I've been here for breakfast about 6 times. Keep trying because I really want to love this place, but food and service is very inconsistent.  Every time it's a different issue.  Yesterday, my crepe order sat on the counter about 5 minutes waiting to be brought over.  Meanwhile, my friend had her meal way ahead of me.  The specialty coffees are served just lukewarm,  so must ask to have them served hot.  The regular menu items are generally very good, but the board special item just wasn't good for either person in our group who ordered it.  The best deal is if you're just going to buy counter bakery items, or if you're lucky in the dining room.</review>< Time>

<gmap_id>0x80dc6e373abbee59:0xdf826bd2ff444f86</gmap_id><Review>My family and I went there June 18 for Father's Day breakfast, the manager shows up with my food with ice cold hash browns, she took it back and came back with another cold hash browns, the second time I let it go, then she brought my wife's plate but unfortunately she didn't like the food and asked the manager if she can order something else, the manager takes the food away, which was untouched, and brings her a different dish but still hands me an additional bill for it. I said you can't have it both ways, you can't take the plate away and still charge me for, in that case I told her to bring it back and I'll take it home for the kids. The so called manager calls my wife cheap and walks away. All decent restaurants will gladly accommodate you if you're not happy with the meal, not this place. For a lousy plate of food they not only lost our long time patronage but our friends as well. I hope the owner Chef Christina would realize what kind of a person is managing her place.< /Review><user>111342492020271883600<//user><rate>1< /rate>< Response>

This is a cozy little spot in the downtown area of Oceanside. We came here because the place across the street was super busy. For a small little bakery, they were able to accommodate 10 of us in under 10 minutes. Grant it, we were a little tight and really close to our neighboring table, but we were starving so we didn't mind.

The staff here is super friendly and served us very quickly. I ordered a "Mocha de Mexico w/peanuts" which tasted like a hot chocolate with a hint of a peanut flavor. It was decent, but I wish it would have came served a little hotter. The temperature wasn't very hot. I also ordered their two egg breakfast, with wheat toast and homefried potatoes. Their potatoes were delicious! The rest of the breakfast was good too, but the crepes were the hit at the table.

I'm glad we diverted from the place across the street and came here. We were very satisfied with the service and tasty food made from scratch!

<Review>Creating great cuisine from scratch using Traditional Techniques and fresh ingredients is the goal of many Chefs.

Achieving it though takes more than dedication, it takes skill, knowledge, and an unwavering commitment to the philosophy of “the right way, every time”.  Throw in the fact that you then want to apply it to producing both savory cuisine as well as baked goods and pastry and things get a whole lot harder. Very few can pull that off, Chef Christine Loyola is a Chef who can.

Great food made from scratch with a great staff and Chef.<//Review><GmapID>0x80dc6e373abbee59:0xdf826bd2ff444f86</GmapID>< rate>

< Review>
Wow, terrific pasteries. $$. Good coffees. I'd have given them 5 stars, except their half & half creamer really needed cleaning in the afternoon & and the barrista seemed uninterested. Perhaps he's a purist -- dairy in coffee -- ugh. My sons would agree with him.</Review>

I have come here several times for coffee and a pastry to go. Their coffee is good, they have lots of variety of baked goods and their prices are reasonable. For mother's day, all I wanted to do was finally go here for breakfast and it was such a disappointment. We had to pay for our food and tip before we got any food or service which was different but I tipped 18% assuming their service would be as good as their coffee. Food came relatively fast but they didn't make my husband's pancakes so we had to wait close to 10 minutes for those and my omlette had ham instead of sausage. Not to mention, my entire plate had a THICK layer of oil. My home fries weren't great and I choked through half my omlette that was literally dripping with oil because I had already paid $65 for our food and didn't want to waste it. My husband just got pancakes, hashbrowns and bacon and his was somehow covered in oil too. We are now home and both have stomach aches and regret. Service was dumpy to say the least. I never got a refill on my coffee and had to flag down people for our forgotten food. We were checked on once as we were about to leave but didn't have a set server, it was kinda whoever was around I guess. So sad because I loved this place as a nice coffee stop but I'm never going back.<//Review>

< Review>
I came here yesterday with 4 of my besties for our monthly GF lunch/ catch up date.  What a delicious experience.  The salmon eggs benedict was  a gourmet treat! Heaven on a plate.  Fresh made 1'thick toast,smoked salmon,egg and perfectly home made bernaise!  A few bites in, i had to stop and declare to the ladies how perfect this  dish was in its entirety!  My lady friends also loved the chicken greek salad, chicken nicious salad, and brisket baquette sandwich combo.
Passion fruit Ice Tea was on point.
It is a must return visit to this Gem spot in downtown Oceanside.< /Review>

I love this bakery cafe and try to go wherever I'm in Oceanside. The pastries and croissant are amazing. The breakfasts are well done with good portions of healthy items. Really nice friendly staff and attention to details makes it very enjoyable every time.</Text>

시금치 치즈 크로와상, 엘리게이터 등... 정말 괜찮습니다. 오션사이드에서 빵을 먹는다면 무조건 추천.< /review>< Pics>
