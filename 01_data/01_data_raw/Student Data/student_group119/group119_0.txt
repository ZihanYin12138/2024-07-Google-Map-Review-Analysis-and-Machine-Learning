<Review>Check engine oil light came on. They said I could bring the car in right away. Repairs were done the next day. They also repaired my windows that weren't working. Everyone was very informative and courteous.  I will definitely be returning for my automotive needs in the future.<//Review>< gmapID>

<review>I went to get my breaks replaced and I came to find out that the boot was loose. It could have costeira my life if I drove more. They also just want your money. I also had something else replaced, according to a code I got, and I got the same code two months later. I wonder if they even replaced that item or if if reset my code and told me they fixed it. I also barely even drive my vehicle.

PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THEM. THEY ARE SUCH A SCAM! You will regret it If you get services from them.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>{'time': 1617050773931, 'text': 'Hi Marcus.

Not friendly or welcoming from the beginning. When I inquired about some work done to my vehicle, the guy said they had no records of my vehicle ever being there let alone what parts they had installed. He assumed and told me that they would put on OEM parts which I found out they hadn’t, they had put the most expensive brand part for the job. The lazy guy on the phone also said had “no way of knowing,” and ”that vehicle has never been here before.” Well I found a copy of he paperwork I needed. Shotty work, the part went bad anyways. They would have to do a lot of making up to me to earn my business back.</Text>< pics>

I was pleasantly surprised when I got an early morning phone call from a number I do not know but I decided to pick it up anyway.
Midas had a fabulous coupon that expired and I came in to utilize it the day before it was to expire but they happened to be closed that day. I made the phone call on the day they were closed and left a message just in case.
I thought I was out of luck until I got this phone call three days later telling me they would be happy to honor the coupon.
Bob and the crew proceeded to give me some fabulous service and I am thankful for the phone call as well as the service and I'll be bringing my cars there regularly.< /review>

<Text>Midas Petaluma is under new ownership. The owner checked in with me personally to make sure that I was happy with my experience there.  They hired DJ who is exceptional at customer service. We have recently had fantastic experiences with our services there. The customer service has been excellent. If you had a bad experience in the past, please consider giving them another chance. We are very pleased with our service there.<//Text>< Pics>

<text>I’ve taken my car to many different shops such as Meineke ,Les Schwab and Midas. Long story short, the staff of Midas in Petaluma are top notch
Excellent customer service, no b.s or up selling- just quality work FAST. Needed a new tire, so I came in without an appointment and was out of there in less than 20minutes
I was very satisfied and would definitely recommend Midas in Petaluma< /text>< gmapID>

Terrible people! I went in December and clearly stated I wanted my brakes changed and they even charged me. Then I take my car for a full inspection and they tell me somewhere else that my brakes are needing to be changed. I called Midas and they told me that we had declined the brakes to be changed although they charged me for it!! Keep in mind I have a one year old in the car whose safety comes first so why would I decline the service? They refused to help and when I asked if they had cameras with audio he said no and said they couldn't do anytni g. They're only good for stealing your money</review>

I cannot recommend this shop and the team of employees enough!  I went there 07/23 due to my car slipping when I accelerated it.  The team got me in quickly and the man helping me at the front desk was so nice and overall happy and chatty with me. Within a few hours they called me back to give me the diagnosis.  Turns out my car was covered under a warranty with the dealership and Scott called the dealership and asked questions to find this information out!  I get to have the issue fixed on my car for free all because Scott went the extra step to call the dealership for me and give me that information.  Who does that stuff anymore? Amazing customer service Scott- you rock! Give him a bonus! BEYOND AWESOME STAFF AND SERVICE!< /text>

<text>Bob at front counter, needs to go to jail!!! This petaluma, "Midas" store, needs to be shut down, for good!! Took my $5000 dollar work truck, into this shop for a water pump leak, on 2/25/2020 with guaranteed same day repair! It is now 22days later 3/17/2020 and still in the petaluma midas shop, with a bill of $11,626.33 and it still, isn't fixed properly, oil leaking, from every, new part, they put on! Now shop mice[or]rat's are eating the interior of my truck while it just sits on the lift, in the shop! Engine light is on! Most shady shop in California..... "DO NOT TAKE YOUR VEHICLE HERE!"

Went for an oil change, they found an issue and did an investigation that I approved. Latch was broken and they overcharged me since they had removed all bumpers (A YouTube video shows how to do it properly in 20mins without any removal). When putting them back they forgot to connect the parking sensor, they moved a bulb which burnt the plastic and on top of that after driving 50miles I found out that the oil tank was empty. The owner contacted me, I provided my feedback and since then no reply from him. There are gas stations doing cheaper basic servicing and for other work a specialist should be chosen (where I ended up after this bad experience at Midas)...< /Text>

I brought my car into this Midas to get the brakes checked out before I went on a cross country road trip.  They insisted that everything was fine even though the car was shaking when I hit the brakes.  I had to stop in the middle of my trip to get them fixed.  I would never recommend this shop to anyone.<//review>

Again with the air filter replacement?  Also I could do without the sales pitch. I'm more interested in why this is going to cost $800 more that originally planned. I left spending more money, and my original repair hadn't been touched yet. The employees seemed fine, but the owner came off as a crook. I don't believe I would trust my vehicle at this place again,  or any Midas for that matter. Apparently 0 stars is not an option.
Went to local heroes auto body,  quoted almost 60% of what midas would have charged.<//Text>

<Review>I came down for a routine oil change.. That was not too be. My last oil change was done by a "reputable" local auto business, and I guess, they stripped my oil pan bolt... Bob (at Midas) was kind enough to Not Charge me anything, even though my car was on the lift with the tires off. What a Great Experience, that would be hard find in the City. They will get All my business from now on. Thank You Bob< /Review></record>

<text>The gentlemen were kind, quick, and courteous. We had nails in our tire on the way out of town. 1 of 3 shops open in town,thankfully. We called the two other places; wait times of an hour or more. Midas said come on in, understood the sense of urgency, had us out in no time. Only 1 tire our size in stock & it was very  inexpensive. We were quite pleased & were able to make our trip. Thanks Robert!</text>< pictures>

Bob was a great help, so informative about the type of oil for my hybrid! I went in to get an oil change and a courtesy check, left in 20 minutes. Great staff, great service, great prices.< /Text>

I came back to Midas after 2 years to replace a headlight bulb. The manager Bob is still here, providing his great customer service. He has a new crew!!!! Chris spotted that my recent oil
change from Pep boys was overfilled by a whole quart.  He re did my oil change as requested and found that my drain plug was stripped and leaking. Chris pointed out his certification from the AOCA with the regulations/guidelines when changing oil and also his ongoing association, I’m really glad to see quality work ethic!!!! The other mechanic John was very professional and really wants to help people with their cars needs, he knows his stuff! I’ve been sitting here watching them help their customers in every way possible. Very satisfied customer I am!</Review>

When we picked the car up 4 hours later they didn't know what was making the sound, but had a laundry list of other things to fix.  I get that they found things I hadn't known about, but I would have liked an answer to the original issue as well.  They were going to charge way too much for the brakes.   Plus the mechanic left grease on my steering wheel and window buttons. Not impressed.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
first thing in the morning I had warning lights going off in my car and no one was open at 6:30am. so when I arrived in Petaluma I stopped at midas and met a nice man named Bob. he saw that I was a little stressed out,  and told me not to worry. he also gave me a loaner car so that I wouldn't be late for work. he gave me an honest opinion of what repairs were needed,  and also charged a very decent price. a few hours later he left me a message asking me to call him back to discuss my car. well normally that's bad news, but to my surprise not very much was wrong and I picked up my car on my lunch break. most times I feel that I'm taken advantage of at most repair shops due to the fact that I'm  a female. not today, Bob treated me fairly and eased my stress. I definitely will return there in the future and I highly recommend them.< /Review>

Went to get a muffler swap and after agreeing to a price and then taking my truck for two hours. I find out they didn’t have the muffler in stock because it has been “discontinued” look online for about 2 seconds and right on the companies site I see the muffler for sale. Other the manager didn’t want the work or his mechanic lied to him. Instead of just ordering the part and take a small$$ off for waistline my time and losing to a customer he said to take it somewhere else. Won’t be going back.<//Text>

I had  issues with my Acura; the VSA light, the brake light, and the (!) light would stay on while driving. I took it to the Acura dealership in Santa Rosa, they wanted to charge me $700 and change to replace the Brake Master Cylinder. I call Bob and he said the would do it for $326.05, the part included. I call other places in Petaluma and not one compare to the estimate that Bob at Midas gave me. I would definitely recommend this place, very knowledgeable at a very fair price.<//Text>

<Resp>None< /Resp><review>(Translated by Google) Very bad experience they said that my truck was wrong and that it came out at 1,500 dls and I went to the dealer and they told me everything was fine, I was investigating that place and I knew that many people have been hurt by the things they do with the cars ai. Be very careful with them, do not believe what they are told, they just want to get money!

(Original)
Muy mala experiencia dijeron que mi camioneta estaba mal y que eso me salía en 1,500 dls y fui al dealer y me dijeron que todo estaba bien, estuve investigando ese lugar y supe que muchas personas an salido perjudicadas con las cosas que ellos hacen con los carros ai. Mucho cuidado con ellos no crean lo que les dicen solo quieren sacar dinero!!</review>< pics>

<Review>What a great service! Roy truly is the friendly locksmith, and I will certainly be using his services again in the future. I called Friendly Locksmith last minute, to get two copies of car keys made for a company vehicle. Roy arrived at our office within one hour of calling, charged a reasonable price and was very professional. I am impressed and highly recommend the Friendly Locksmith to anybody out there needing locksmith services.< /Review><time>1615492163180</time><Rating>5</Rating>< Pics>

I was locked out of my car 2 times this month (because of a broken door handle) and both times Roy came within the time frame he said. He gave me a solid price because he understood that I was having a tough time beforehand and I couldn't be happier with the service. Quick and professional</Review>

<Text>This review comes a week and a half late but the experience I had with a friendly locksmith Roi was so impressive that I had to write him a review. I had borrowed a friends truck and accidentally locked the keys in the passenger seat in my driveway blocking my own car.
Within 20 minutes of calling Roi he arrived and was able to unlocked truck. I do have AAA but the soonest that they could send a locksmith out would be an hour to an hour and 15 minutes. I am so grateful to Roi and her friendly locksmith for saving my day. In a polite and timely fashion.< /Text><userid>109565270137776723533< /userid></record></dataset><record>

I've have used this locksmith service for over 6 years and I have never called anyone else since having work done by Roy! Hallways responds to my home location within 15 minutes and have finished job orders under 30 minutes. Amazing service that exceeds expectations, I'm so happy and will Roy (Friendly Locksmith) for years to come. The name of his business reflects his personality!!< /review>

Very accommodating to meet me at the house and arrange a time that worked for us both. He described everything he did before he did it so there were no surprises. I would call him first when I need help with a lock.<//Text>

My son lost the only key to his car. I called Roy and set up a same day appointment. Roy arrived on time and made brand new keys for the car within 30 minutes. He was friendly and knowledgeable and got the job done for a super price. I will definitely use him again for my locksmith needs.<//review>

Roy is such a cool dude, I accidentally locked myself out of my house lol and I called him and he happened to live across the street from me! Came right away and unlocked for me in seconds! I’m so happy with his service that I decided to have him duplicate my car keys for both my cars! If you are in a jam, call him!< /review>

Friendly Locksmith are life savers! Our car was broken into and the house keys were stolen,  a scary situation! we needed Re keying ASAP. We were lucky that the locksmith was available and quoted us a reasonable price since we had 12 locks to change! The tech has a mobile lab in his van so he works in lightening speed.  All the keys were made and locks installed In a couple of hours.  Thank you so much for helping secure our home!</review>

I called many Locksmiths around my area to reprogram my key for my car and their prices were a bit on the higher side. I came to a point where I just wanted my car fixed and wouldn’t mind paying that extra money but I wasn’t getting my phone calls answered from other locksmiths. I called friendly locksmith and they arrived within 1 hr and provided excellent fast and friendly service. I would definitely recommend!<//review>

Roy is awesome - professional, friendly, calm, made me feel completely at ease. Showed up faster than promised, got me into my car quickly with ZERO damage to the body, and charged me about 20% less than what I was quoted by a couple of other locksmiths in the area.  Can't recommend highly enough. Thank you!<//Text>

Soon after I called, Roy the locksmith came to my rescue and had my car door opened. He did not damage anything, he did not over charge me and overall was a very pleasant person and a very professional service provider.
Hopefully that I'll never have to call a locksmith again, but if I do I'm going to use Friendly Locksmith and ask for Roy.</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

This is my second time using Friendly...or Roy, who is just great!  He's fair.  He's honest. He's very, very reasonable in price. And he's better than punctual; he called one hour before our scheduled appt. to see if he could come early. So hes also courteous. I'll say this, I wish every business I deal with was like Friendly...Roy.  Call him first! You won't regret making the call.

Wow. What service!  I got lucky he had a cancellation so he was here in an hour. I needed a key for a late model car. It was no problem. He did the job and I'm a happy camper!  There's a reason they are called friendly!  And that shows in the attitude and service provided. Friendly Locksmith is now on my contact list. I'll definitely use him again.</review>

I misplaced my car keys for my 2004 Honda Civic yesterday. I called around to get a few quotes and finally felt at ease with a company called Friendly Locksmith. They were clear and transparent about the pricing over the phone unlike other companies I called. Roy the locksmith arrived in less time than I anticipated and was quick and professional. He made my key and communicated with me through the process. I appreciate the great service and great price! Thanks Roy!</text>

I wanted to change the locks but honestly didnt know who to trust. A friend recomended that I call Friendly Locksmith. I called and Roy came very quickly. He made me feel so safe, comfortable and at ease. He took extra time and talked me through which type of locks to choose and gave me a great price. I would use his service again in a heartbeat and I will definitely recommend him to friends and family. Thanks so much Roy for bringing me some peace of mind!<//text>< Pictures>

Called them and they immediately answered. They said they will squeeze me in today and could be over in about 1 hour. Showed up fully equipped and went to work. They were done with entire repair in about 1 hour. Very punctual and professional company and we will be using them again for other window needs.</review>

The owner Sabah had very good customer service.   He beat the lowest price from all competitors.   He was on time and very knowledgeable.  The replacement windshield was very good quality.   He was not trying to hustle me like most people.    So far his work has be top notch.   I will definitely use this company again and I will be referring all my family and friends to Sabah.<//Text>

<Text>Last evening my car was broken into from a right front passenger side window smash and run.  This morning I called GTAG and the owner said he would help me get things replaced immediately.  An hour later he arrived and replaced the broken window without me even having to remove the vehicle from my garage.  An hour later all was done and I appreciated the thoroughness in the clean up of all the glass within the vehicle.  More than impressed with Golden Touch and would highly recommend you consider them.</Text></record>

I contacted Sabah at Golden Touch Auto and his quote/cost was WAY below what the others were asking. He came to me the same day I called him and completed the job efficiently and quickly.

Couldn't have made a better decision than calling Golden Touch. Sabah came out to me the very next day and replaced my windshield and driver side window. Was reasonably priced, done timely and looks great! Definitely would recommend to anyone</review>

I called some of the advertised big boys and the wanted $310-400. To replace my windshield. And truss to sell me wipers before I even got a price.  I called this company and they came out the same day and did a great job in 105 degree weather for A much better price . I would definitely recommend them and use them again.</review>

<Rate>1<//Rate><text>Did not have a great experience with this man. I wanted to get my moonroof fixed and looked at a whole bunch of reviews and decided to pull the trigger with this business since it had great reviews overall. I contacted the man his name was Sabah and I told him my situation with my moonroof. We then set a time and place to meet to see what he could do for me. So I met him and we were discussing pricing before he took a look at anything and insured me Atleast three times that I was “in good hands” and that I “will be very well taken care of”. He also said he would be able to fix the problem I had even before he checked it out which I thought was weird because neither I nor him knew what was wrong in the first place! So as we finally agreed on a price, he was taking my moonroof apart right there in the parking lot. And after he got done taking everything apart he told me that EVERYTHING was broken, And that I would have to get a whole new assembly. So I asked him if there was any way he can fix it at all and he said “NO”, that I can’t use this at all and he actually told me not to use it at all because it was that messed up, which was funny to me because In the beginning he said that he could and that I would be “In good hands”. So after he told me that he then started putting everything back and not only was he having trouble putting everything back I had to assist him in the process! Another note too is that when he was putting everything back to get he did NOT clean all the dirt and grime from my cloth interior on the top. There were fingerprints (a whole lot of them too!) in Atleast 4 different spots. Lucky I had degreaser at home and wiped them all off before they could stain. So after all of that telling me that he could not fix it, having trouble putting everything back, not cleaning after himself, he asks me if I’m still going to pay him! I told him “but you didn’t fix anything?” And his response? He doesn’t say a word and slams my door. Real professional...< /text>< pics>

He was a little gruff  and off-putting on the phone, and I almost went to the more expensive stone and mortar business because of it. The reason I didn't, was because he was able to meet and within an hour to fix my windshield. The other place, said I'd have to wait until the weekend was over and come in on Monday morning. I had errands to run and didn't want the crack to spread as I was driving all over town.

He met me at Walmart, I was a little concerned allowing a stranger to come to my house. Was tolerant when I was late due to a delay from the school bus. Fixed the chip in my windshield, and cleaned the whole windshield too, not just the one little spot where he worked on!</review>

Not satisfied with my service at all, very unproffesional. Took 3 days to even set up an appointment to get my sunroof fixed. He told me he would call me back but never would, I had to keep calling. After the appointment was set up he gave me a quote, note, I had provided the glass. He gave me the price of $250 to replace my sunroof glass because mine had shattered. When he got out to my car he said asked if I could move the sun shade back, which I couldnt do, because there was glass stuck in the tracks. He said that was going to be an extra $100. You would think something like that would be expected for a broken sunroof.. I think this guy just thought he could get more money out of me. The job took him about 20 minutes, and then he walked away with $350. And a very unsatisfied customer. Would not reccomend.</review>

Love that this place is always so clean and welcoming. I always get help from Stephany and she is just the sweetest and always helps me out when there are certain products that I am unsure of. The cashiers are pretty fast so if it's ever pretty busy the line moves fast so that's always a plus.</Text>

<text>Floor sales manager took me around... Still working on some kinks with my routine but she was knowledgeable in alternative products to try... She was awesome 👌, very friendly and polite... I can get a little excited in the store hehe... But the scrub and grape seed oil to replace my HA was awesome... Dating profiles r getting more action too... I heavily favor swinging by the store to avoid shipping fees...< /text><name>thebergytv< /name>< resp>

I’ve been a frequent shopper at Ulta in rolling hills for the last 5 years and I have never had a negative experience until recently. I went into the store looking for a high end foundation and I was helped by a manager who has dark hair and I heard one of the other employees call her Raven. She was so rude and dismissive and was unable to help me at all. She spoke to me with an attitude and seemed like she didn’t know what she was talking about. I heard her mistreat one of the other associates when they asked her for help. After she began speaking to me rudely I left the store without my foundation and will not be returning if I see her inside. I’m very disappointed that Raven was unhelpful and disrespectful to me and her fellow associates.<//review>

<review>*****I shop at Sephora now. Ulta has definitely lost a customer. I’ve been shopping here since it opened and spent over 2,000 dollars worth of makeup. The management and staff are so unprofessional, and I’m done being abused my them. I was so kind but they where extremely rude. surprised why they work there. Their job is to be kind and to help the customers. Not be ignoring and rude to them. Very upset about this and wasted 2,000 dollars here.< /review></record></dataset><record>

This is by far the best Ulta I have ever been to!
The store is super clean, prices are well marked, and the employees are the most down to earth out of all of the stores I've visited.
The store was incredibly well stocked and the travel/trial sized stuff they keep at the front was organized and priced correctly.
These women are so easy to talk to, they made great suggestions on products and I could not be happier with my entire experience there.
I will drive the extra 25 minutes next time just to go to this store!!!<//Text>

<rate>2< /rate><review>I hope this location does okay, but twice the staff has ignored or been rude. They need to stop judging customers. Sometimes people come in to buy gifts for others.the manager was the only one that took the time to be courteous. I see lots of other good reviews with good service, so hopefully they are working on it. Not sure we would give them a 3rd try. Regardless, SHOP LOCAL!<//review><Time>1492018796465<//Time>< GmapID>

< review>
Very poor communication took place at this store between one employee and a manager named Destiny which led to a total waste of time. When I pointed this out to Destiny, she was very rude and completely unprofessional from beginning to end.

It is quite obvious that serving the customer with tact and professionalism is not a priority for this company. If it were, Destiny would not have been so brazen during our conversation.

I will not give any of the Ulta stores my business again.< /review>

Love this place!  Great coupons & sales.  The ULTA brand lip sticks are becoming some of my favs.  They always have bogo or some other cool deal.  Great colors & alot of reds.  The color lasts long & stays vibrant.  They have most cosmetic brands & skin care.  Skip the mall & head to ulta.< /Text>

<username>Graciela Rojas</username><date>1458429021736</date><rating>1</rating><review>Horrible experience they have Donald Trumps working for them, my sister and I were completely discriminated, I understand its in a very nice upper class neighborhood but that gives them no right to treat us that way because we are all customers, yes we were the only Hispanics and the employee there helped the blonde lady first then SKIPPED us and helped the Asian lady it was so obvious ! we weren't even welcomed in the store like everybody else, and I was wearing an item and the cashier really liked it and she asked what brand it was and I told her and she said "oh that's expensive" By the way we got treated I'm assuming she thought I couldn't afford it, I am NEVER going back to that Ulta its BS its beyond me what these IDIOTS did to us.< /review>< pics>

I was ignored by the staff although there were only a few other customers in the store. They said somebody would be over to help me. I decided to leave after waiting for 15 minutes while the staff was just standing behind the counter talking.</Review>

<Review>One of the best Ulta's I have shopped at for makeup. The staff is friendly - both sales floor employees and the managers (who have always been on the floor and available when I shop here), the products are well placed, and I always end up spending way more than I should because of the attentive service and great products.<//Review>< Pictures>

I do not know anything about beauty products, but I was immediately assisted with help and advice with what I should buy for my female family members. Very helpful and clean, the staff are amazing.< /Review>

Great addition to the Peninsula Center! This Ulta location just opened last week and they had many grand opening specials for 3 days! They were passing out different value gift cards ranging from $5 to $100 for the first 100 guests each of the 3 days, but I visited in the evening so I didn't get one. The layout is similar to every other Ulta that I've visited. There's also a salon at this location, including a BrowBar for your brown/lip waxing needs. Prices are also similar to the other locations. All the staff members I encountered were really friendly and excited to be there.

Parking is plentiful in this shopping plaza that also houses TJ Maxx, Pavilions, and local eateries. I hope this location does well as many other shops have come and gone.<//Text>

Staff including manager watched me but did not ask if I needed help until I brought it to their attention that I noticed they were keeping tabs on me but not assisting. The manager was flippant and nonchalant so I didnt purchase the items I picked out. I realize there isn't much diversity in this area so when they see it, all their misguided ignorant stereotypes come to mind. I just moved from Georgia, a red state, and never had that experience in my local Ulta.<//text>

I have gone here a few times for parts, I don’t recommend them at all. They are very shady people. Stay as far from them as possible. They overcharge for parts and have no idea what parts are correct. I have bought one thing from them and I would rather drive to Chula Vista from now on than deal with these people.<//text>

Trying to find a part in this place was crazy. I called up and they said all calls back in 30 minutes and then at the end of 30 minutes they have me call back in 45 minutes the end of 45 minutes they let me call back in another 30 minutes just to tell me they didn't have the part they couldn't check up until that final time to me that's no way to run a business!</text>

Gave wrong part

Won't refund money unless u raise hell

Won't serve u if u point out their lack of integrity

I specifically told them that I won't a part from a particular car and instead they went and took it from a older model and I spent two day in the heat working for nothing, then they won't serve me and laugh about knowingly I have no car to go down the hill... what illegal jerks</review>

< Review>
Was happily surprised with this small spot on a dock! The fresh local fish was fun to try and they did the tacos well! They offer reasonably priced local bottles of wine as well. Fun to see sea lions swimming in the waters. Great views. They have heaters for their large patio.< /Review>

The clam chowder was the best that I have ever had. Delicious!! Prawns & fish were great. Best tartar sauce. Outstanding meal! Highly recommend! It was a little chilly by the water, but enjoyed the atmosphere.</Text>

<Review>Good place to stop for a large portion of fried (a bit greasy) fish at a reasonable price. Nice setting right by the dock. Vehicles and motorcycles driving by were loud.< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM_oEdfxBiMfiK70rk3vkx-GCosoJWa2MSHNCLo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMiFK1zrScYNhIMkaFf75vf3ZON2icfabjj_jtb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNxNUVgTQFQqeQH7m8GGRNdW29sKvW0_AlNkveZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOnXeVa93waFf-ioUU5k6CtcsQJewLyPCYR85FJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMcu386KLndj0spkWCvnpMUkGkXGIDccm-LOauM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOpeLn6-5zIcLZo9IAD-zu0lSjmhXoxfM_E5tGy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP90bae0dXwOKsiwEkb65gK110AoKRYnjXZWFg2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

During the three days I was in the Ft. Bragg area, this place was always fairly busy. Once I tried it I realized why. Fish's breading was not greasy, yet the fish itself was juicy and tasty. Nice crunch. Fries were crunchy and very good.< /text>

Cute, casual place with outdoor seating. The man and woman inside were very friendly and the younger man delivering food was great. Maui Maui tacos and local beer were fantastic.<//Review>

<Review>Wow!!! I cant say enough good stuff about this place! The fish was incredibly fresh and flavorful, the batter was absolutely delicious, and the chips were some of the best fries I've ever had. Perfect crunch, super flavor, absolutely delicious! The mozzarella sticks are tip notch as well! Theres a reason why this place is a favorite of the locals, and is almost always busy! Definitely recommend, and I'll definitely be going back again!< /Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPbeshlIguKLKDrVPYIkDJhIUO-CwT_QJKzglou=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMu7DEbQQuh2OsXLht3YMIe_xqr5q9lfoypXSFh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

We ate outside by the dock. While eating our fish and chips and fresh crab, a seal popped up in the water beside us. It was amaizing! The kids reaction was priceless. And our 23 month old love throwing fries to the gulls.</Review>

What a fun place! I went here on my birthday last weekend. I scored a great table by the water with a heater near by for my toddler. The view was great!
My Hubs and I ordered a variety of different things, we enjoyed all of it!
The best part of it all was there were a pack of 5 otters that swam right up to us as if to say hi!
The staff was very helpful and friendly! Prices were great and the views are fantastic! What a great experience. Will be visiting again. A+<//review>

I'm going to give 4 stars only because of the service and some people there. We had our dog with us and other people with dogs would just stop and stare causing our German Shepherd to get defensive. I also asked for a box to go, waited 15 mins, still no box. My wife had to go inside the place to get a box after asking another server for a box but couldn't get one for about 20 mins. The food, the food was AMAZING! Best fish and chips I've ever had in California and the prawns were MASSIVE! Well worth the price and wish I could get them everyday. Definitely worth checking out.<//text>

We had the clam chowder, the fish and shrimp, and the mozzarella sticks.  It's the best fish and chips I have ever had due to the freshness of the fish and the seasoning in the flour mixture.  I would pass on the cheese sticks in the future.  We sat on the water's edge and saw harbor seals, otters, and sea gulls.  The restaurant is directly across from the Coast Guard boats.<//review>

<Date>1568173172874</Date><rating>4<//rating><review>Crunchy, fresh seafood, helpful staff, clean area. Mostly outside seating. Good solid benches to get through the oceanside weather. One thing I'd like to see, and maybe it's there and I'm not seeing it, is some salad or slaw to break up the fried food. Good prices, hefty portions. Quick service. Will be a good take out choice in the winter</review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOWc1JsarmB8XWB-pzwFoJJSlg5vbGFstc09dwq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPHZ_ORKUde2n1xjxyO3fIcV706QqY9c3oOYAYQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

Nice spot and scenery, mostly an outside-eat area. I had their ciabatta hamburger, for I wasn't in the mood for fish, and was pleasantly surprised! The burger meat was about half inch thick with good, crunchy fries. Was not expecting a good burger at a fishery! Satisfied, overall.</Text>

<Review>Craving fish tacos? This is the place. I’ve never had better fish tacos in my life. We came across this place because nowhere else was open on a Wednesday for outdoor dining, that we could find, and it was so worth it. We will definitely be coming back here again. And again.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<Text>I've lived in town for years.  There is another fish and chips place in the harbor. I ate there regularly and recommended it to out of towners.  One day I thought I would give Noyo Fish a try. I will never eat or refer the other place again. Noyo Fish has has larger portions and prices are better< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

Cute little seafood spot.  Friendly service by owner & employees.  It's a fast service type of biz...you order @ the counter & wait for your number to be called.
Super quick & efficient service @ 11:30 on a Friday.  There is outdoor harborside seating as well as a few tables inside.  I ordered the fried prawns without the fries.  Perfectly fried.  The prawns were succulent.   Cocktail sauce was good.</Text>

Got the chowder in a bread bowl. For the price it was pretty small (soup bowl and Pellegrino $15). Unfortunately,  because it was so small and had well over 3/4 inch thick sides, it only held 3-4 oz of soup. Even worse, it wasn't flavorful.< /Review>

Good customer service here. Bought me a really cute black guess backpack/purse, my daughter a cute small floral purse and a tiny coin bag, and my hubby a wallet and some shades. We love our stuff guess is my other go to place aside from Nike and old navy.< /Review>

I bought a pair of earrings that were gold colored that tarnished after 2 days. I clean them with alcohol prior to wearing them and I'm not able to return them. Now they look like brass and I wasted my money.</Text>

Worst experience ever not only did I feel like I was being followed around the store the whole time the staff was rude and unhelpful! I highly recommend they review their outlet discount discription. I felt like they decided to modify it to their convenience all the other stores honored my triple a discount except this location. I will never shop here Again you totally lost a customer. I've been in customer service for a well known bank for almost 10 years and let me say I go above and beyond for my customers and their experiences. A piece of advise if you can not work with people or different ethnicities find a different career.<//text>

<review>Horrible customer service, rude and incompetent. The employees were contradicting each other, and clearly didn't know the store policies.

Also, they ordered an item online for me because they didn't have the correct size, and found out they do not give store credit exchanges for online purchases.

Not worth shopping here< /review>< Resp>

<Review>Mike who took my order was so helpful and they delivered it quickly nearby and the Pad Thai was great because it had crunchy vegetables in it too. Not just noodles and shrimp. Definitely will order again next week. Thanks R Thai!<//Review>< username>

<Text>Loma Linda seems to be blessed with about two Thai restaurant every block. When yet another Thai restaurant popped up next to A Dong I didn’t even give it a second look. A couple years later and the restaurant changed its name and changed from serving small $5 plates to serving dishes like every other Thai restaurant. The food and service are great, and I was able to try the pad Thai, pat see ew, and parang curry. Classic flavors and competitive prices.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

The food was delicious the service was great and the atmosphere was authentic.  I live 5 minutes from here and this is the first time I tried it, believe me it won’t be the last.  The prices were very reasonable and me my wife and son shared our food.  Highly recommended.</Review>

<time>1564761173368< /time><rating>4</rating><review>I came here for the fresh rolls, but quickly discovered that their curry and pad Thai is delicious! I ended up eating off my husband's plate. The fresh/spring rolls were okay, but could not compete with the decadent noodles and curry around me. I would definitely come back here again, prepared to eat more noodle-based dishes. The spices are amazing here- if you want spicy, they will make it spicy (and vice versa if you prefer no spice).<//review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

There's a lot of thai places in this area, this is probably one of the better ones. Flavors are strong and also their spice condiments taste good if you like spicy. The restaurant is kinda small so it's often filled but not too long of a wait. Prices are pretty average. Would recommend.< /Review>

I ordered Pad Thai when I went there the other day. I remember another time at another Thai restaurant in Redlands I had ordered Pad Thai and they went heavy on the fish sauce, and I couldn't finish it, it was not appetizing. So I decided to customize this order and told them to put very little to no fish sauce, and you know what? It was bomb. I would definitely come back for that order alone, but I will be coming back and trying other food items in their menu. The ambience is actually nice, humble but with a touch of class. I would definitely recommend anyone to give this place a try.</review>

1 year later and Pho Basil is still without a doubt the best Thai/Vietnamese fusion restaurant I have ever been to. A staple of the Boston culinary scene and I would argue the best spot in the city.<//text>

Just OK.  The red curry was not red, but yelloe and very watered down.  The meat (chicken) was tough.  I've had better from this restaurant but on Friday, November 9th, my food was lacking quality.< /text>

Excellent location and frendly service. There is a good amount of seating for a small business. I had the "R" Thai Fried Rice and it was amazing. The flavor and the sauce that was on the side was spicy but had great flavor. To finsh had the boba coffee which was excellent as well. I would highly recommend and will definitely be back.<//text>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) Very good taste, generous portions if you exaggerate the quantity, warmth and good service, prices are accessible to all budgets.

Muy buen sabor, raciones generosas si exagerar la cantidad, calidez y buen servicio, los precios son accesibles a todos los bolsillos.</Review>

Its just an old bad spot to me with some negative  history and memories to it. @ crime, homeless, theft, assault, drunks, druggiez, street games, horror story. CPTSD. No security that I sa in or outside and the employees seemed to be just as afraid as some of the customers.<//Review>

I sat down at a dirty station and all of the stations were full with no spacing. A man pushed the tools previously used to the side and put a towel down. I asked if he was going to clean the station first, he moved the towel and used a nail brush to brush off the station and put the towel back down. I then asked if he was going to sanitize the station and he said no need to because of the towel.... that’s when I immediately left.

If you value cleanliness, I would pass on going to this salon.<//text>

We had a great time! The customers and employees are very welcoming. Im a guy and my mom is in a wheelchair and we were not looked at or treated differently. We felt welcomed by both the other customers there and the staff. We will definitely be coming back on a regular basis.

Thanks Roseville Nail and Spa!!</Text>

<Text>Nice salon but pricey for what is offered. Salon specialist uses foot scrubber for much longer than necessary and it hurt a bit. Just not as relaxing during foot massage as expected even though I paid for 5 minutes longer massage. Did not seem worth it.</Text>< pictures>

Poor service my appointment was at 6 pm got to wait 30mins and they close at 7ish they messed up my nails with a different color. Incomplete service and asked me to come to get it done the next day. Because a guy has to go pick up his daughter which I understand so I said yes.<//Review>

This salon is so amazing. I had the best salon experience ever. The staff is so friendly and very good at what they do. They did my pedicure and manicure at the same time, were very gentle. I got a basic pedi and asked for the callus treatment on my feet and they did such a good job with that. I wanted to try the dip powder manicure for the first time and turned out so beautiful with the matte top coat. I highly recommend this salon. Very reasonable prices too.<//review>

My daughter and I walked in after getting my hair done. It was busy, but they got us in right away. I had gel manicure a regular pedicure, I was very happy with my nail technician, she was very thorough and the massage was perfect. I’ll definitely go back again.</Review>

Prices did change just a touch, but are still reasonable.
Overall, I'm not sure what i think about the updated salon. I will likely come again in a month or so and reevaluate.
Does seem there are a lot more technicians working here now that speak very little to no English- making the experience a bit more frustrating when trying to ask for something specific.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><user_id>105178399619903284106</user_id></record></dataset><record>

This is the 2nd time I have gone to Roseville nail spa and had Leo do my nails. The 1st time I got powder nails and they last a long time but they're kind of thick for my liking. This time I got gel manicure and love the outcome. The Polish stays on for 2 to 3 weeks.< /Review>

very rude and aggressive. The lady that was doing my nails literally filled my skin more than my nails. She yelled at me because the machine didn’t dry one of my nails completely and then blamed it on me.< /review>

Is to be my absolute favorite place to go. But the last 3 months I have tried to make appointments and they are too busy to even take my appointment. Calling ahead to make an appointment on a weekend does not seem to work any longer. When I explain to the lady had been coming every 3 weeks for 2 years she said so sorry. When I told her I would make an appointment across the street she said OK good idea .</Review>

Very knowledgeable about the grooming of the toe nail beds and they understand about excessive chatter. If you set expectations at the beginning of the appointment they allow you to relax without to much noise.< /text>

The first time we went here me and my boyfriend got and I got pedicures for our anniversary. I asked for the lavender packages with extra rubbing .There was nothing lavender involved the entire time even though I mentioned it at least 4 different times and they wanted to charge us $40 extra just for a few minutes each of extra hard rubbing. She instead ground into my shins painfully for 15 minutes or so. The second time my boyfriend said he loved it there and wanted to go back. I was hesitant but agreed. We asked for the same lavender package we wanted before and what do you know we got lavender with good rubs and it was great. But then after we left he told me that she left the harsh callous removal chemical on his foot walked off for more than 5 minutes and when she came back didn't attend to that foot for another 5 minutes. His foot in between his toes is raw and red his foot is in major pain and he can barely walk. We won't be returning.<//Text>

<Review>Returned to what used to be Venetian Nails and found it renamed Roseville Nails. Makeover!!! Beautiful new pedicure chairs in a golden beige all with matching stools! New paint is beige and new lighting! Bright and beautiful!! Most importantly: NEW METHOD OF PEDICURE! New covers for every person getting a pedicure-looks like a shower cap but bigger-covers the entire tub to prevent fungal spreading! Safe and used only on you! Then thrown away! I love this place now and the girls were efficient and quick. Back in 2 weeks!!</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

< Review>
The guy who did my nails didn't know what he was doing. I got pink and whites, and he dripped glue all over, didn't file correctly, and put way too much clear coat over all my nails at the end. When I came in I heard a woman telling the lady who was doing her pedicure to stop and she no long wanted it. She didn't like her attitude. I complained that I didn't like the nail job, and they gave me attitude,  and then guy got up and walked away. He told a young teenage girl to finish. So I just wanted to leave. They charged me $5 more than what they previously told me. I tip everyone that does my nails, but not this time. Don't go here! Seriously a waste of time and money!< /Review>

< Review>
Went here because of the 4.5 star review but was quickly disappointed. A brief description of my experience.
1) Waited 20 mins to be seen but was told only a 15 min wait
2) Linda did my gel manicure (I don't reccomend her).To remove the old gel she put waaaay too much acetone in the foil so that my fingertips were almost frozen before she got to them.
3) The worst part of my experience was when she was cleaning the cuticles. She was rushing and kept nicking into my skin causing bleeding on every cuticle bed. In 20 years of doing my nails I have never had so many lacerations and so much bleeding on all my fingers from cleaning the cuticles. When I brought this to her attention, instead of an apology she blamed my nails for causing the bleeding. Never an acknowledgement or apology for this.
4) With all the cuts on my fingers from her sloppy work, for the rest of the session, whenever she would rub my nails with acetone or alcohol, they would sting even further. She would rub it aggressively, rushing to  I'm not sure where,  and causing even more pain.
5) The whole expereince was quite a nightmare. Manicures are supposed to be a somewhat relaxing experience; not make shift torture chambers which is exactly what this was.
6) The only reason I gave 1 star instead of 0 is the price was reasonable.
7) My fingers will be hurting for days from this, and stinging every time I wash my hands or use alchohol cleanser (which I do quite frequently as I'm a medical professional)
8) Would not reccomend coming here unless you enjoy being tortured for an hour and having it last for a week or 2 until your cuticle beds heal.<//Review>

Slow slow slow! 6 cars and 25 minutes later (fast food??) lost my appetite! Person taking orders and drive thru staff seemed incompetent. I hope their management fixes this ASAP! Been to over 10 other locations and never had a slower experience. No wonder it always has slow lines... 🤦🏻‍♂️ Not coming back until they fix this<//text>

I know it's artificial, but I love that they say, "My pleasure," instead of "No problem." I also like that they ask questions to clarify my order. The food was tasty and hot.

<Text>This is a kids favorite. Their drive through line wasn’t very well thought out as often the cars block the rest of the road, but that is just a testament to how people love it. Friendly staff, food has been tasty and the orders have always been right.<//Text>< GmapID>

Chicken fil A is always great, which is why there is amost always a line to get in....spicy chicken sandwich deluxe is always the crowd favorite.   Great stuff, and always consistent.< /Review>

The food had that nice wok/pan toasted flavor to it.  Everything was so hot and so fresh, just a little bit oily (necessary and perfect) and it was everything you'd love about freshly cooked Thai food.  My tofu was fried on the outside.  Soft on the inside.  And I ordered extra egg in my dish.  Good God.  I hate to imagine what I sounded like eating my food lol.</text>

<review>Both of the times that I have ordered from this Chic Fil A, I have been missing one or more items. It’s frustrating because with everything being a drive through there isn’t always time to wait in the line and go back around because someone’s entire meal is missing. Most of my Chic Fil A experiences have been positive, unfortunately I cannot say the same for this location.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

I've never been to a chick fil-a where the management staff is so cavalier and lackluster. Every time I walk into this place to managers are on their phones, sitting down, and/or eating.  Even the regular staff is less friendly here, but it starts at the top. I guess it isn't your pleasure today . . .<//text>

although the food is good, they've managed to mess up my order a few times. 1st time they lost my tag or something and had to remake my order. more recently they completed it, bagged it, and left it on the counter. No one had called my name. not sure what happened there. a shame.< /review>

Super great chicken sandwich. One of the best in town.  Always consistent. Just remember that they don’t open on Sunday’s.</Review>

I went to the dessert place. Forgot what I ordered except for an ice cream which took me 10 minutes to get my meaning crossed. The ladies don't speak English. The communication was very hard and I got something I did not want. But it was okay. The other things I got was mediocre. This place is definitely overrated and overly priced by all the traveling guides and blogs.<//review>

I just ordered some chicken sandwiches deluxe's, chicken nugs, and a frosted coffee. I haven't had chick-fil-a in almost half a year, and it was really good. The frosted coffee was amazing, and way better then expected. The sandwiches had no cheese on them which sucked, but it's ok, they tasted good regardless. Definitely going to order again soon :)</review>

<Text>Fast and friendly even during their busiest times. A good place to go for a lunch break during work. Team members are very friendly. If you happen to dine in, you will also notice there are people who regularly go to each table to make sure everyone is alright. Good quality service for fast food.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Aside from their good chicken sandwiches, the friendly nature of all chick fil A employees at every location is a main component of why I frequent this establishment as opposed to bottom barrel fast food joints.< /review>

The food is so good. Everything comes out warm as expected. My favorite are their sandwiches because they have really good chicken. Another thing that I really enjoy from their resturants are their sauces. They offer a lot and you don't have to pay extra. To add they also have a good lemonade that can even be good on a rainy day. They have fast and nice employees that can light up the day.</Text>

<review>This place sucks. They always get my order wrong. Food's always cold.  Lemonade is super bitter. Go to Raising Canes across the way. Everything is better at Cane's. The chicken, fries, lemonade, Texas toast. Always fresh. Always hot. I've never had Canes mess up my order, not once.<//review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

Chic-filet is Chic-filet. You know what yr going to get & they're consistent. Great shakes here too. The fries aren't my favorite but they are better than In N Out fries... In my opinion.
If you like chicken fingers, nuggets & chicken sandwiches, this is a great spot for ya.
And, it's a family run, Christian business. They take care of their employees. Are closed on Sundays & I think that helps - VS the McDonald's employees that all seem to hate being there.<//Text>

<text>Good people providing good service with an excellent atmosphere, is a rare combo but this little restaurant has done it. great workers and great managers look to serve friends, not customers. you walk in here and it feels like you're being helped by family. that's a rarity. the cleanliness is superb and the food isn't just good priced, it's also a down right party for your mouth. Nothing more I can say other then get your feet down here and enjoy.</text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

Chick-fil-A is my go to place when I can't decide where to go. It has fantastic food and the shop in Aliso Town Center is well kept with friendly staff. Most days start with their breakfast burrito combo.< /review>

Customer service what's quite adequate.  However I did find that there were what I assumed supervisors dressing more casually.  However I did not find this offensive and was satisfied overall with my service.<//Text>

<review>Chic fil a is always yummy. Even if I can never seem to get to one in time for breakfast :(.
This one is rather small but clean as all the rest. It has to compete with a canes a few doors down, but chic fil a sauce just tastes so much better 👌.< /review>< Time>

<Text>I like Chick-Fil-A, especially their spicy chicken deluxe sandwich + waffle fries + sweet tea combo. This location is somewhat inconsistent with the quality of the food. Sometimes it's really great. Sometimes it's too salty, too oily, or chicken was fried too long and became dry. The people who work there are all very nice. It's never too busy inside, but drive thru line can be long.</Text><response>None< /response><Rate>3< /Rate>< Gmap_id>

Service is good as always, ordering is simple and friendly cashiers. It just happened to be I got in the middle of a birthday party, only two tables were available, so I can't complain because everything was under control is just I preffer to come in when it's less buisy. Aside from that, good experience.<//review>

So close to everything! Best breakfast sandwiches you can get anywhere!
Who doesn't like biscuits and chicken
in the morning?
( The dog gets the biscuit I get the chicken or most of it, being gluten intolerant in a diplomatic ruler and all......) 😀< /review>

Friendly service, great food, good  prices, wonderful brownies. Thanks for the boycot! It introduced me to a great fast-food place. I'm sorry the previous reviewer is so misinformed. Chick-fil-A is an outstanding organization that supports it's employees and many fine organizations.</Text>
