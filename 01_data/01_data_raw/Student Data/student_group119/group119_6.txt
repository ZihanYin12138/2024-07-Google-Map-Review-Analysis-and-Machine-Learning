Great service. I went online, created an account, described what I wanted, and was connected with a photographer immediately. I met with the photographer, Aldo, the next day for the shoot. He was professional, easy-going, and knew what he was doing. A fully edited photo gallery was delivered electronically within a day or two. The photos came out awesome, despite there being heavy clouds and a little rain that day. Thanks Snappr!< /Text>

<text>It was really easy to book a photographer and see part of their portfolio. I love not having hidden fees or to call around to get rates.
The man that came out was extremely courteous and it was obvious he had photographed cars before. Pictures turned out well and I'm overall very happy with my first experience with snapper.<//text>< rating>

I am a real estate agent in Utah and needed photos of a property my sister owns and rents in the Los Angeles area. I wasn't sure how to find a good photographer in the area. I stumbled onto Snappr and the more we heard, the more we liked. We took a little bit of a chance, not having worked with this company before. We were very pleasantly surprised. The whole shoot was well-coordinated and our photographer, Joakim, was top-notch! We are very happy with the results! And we thought the price was very reasonable. Many thanks!< /text>

Our Company was in need of professional grade photos quickly with very specific before and after (small timing windows) shoots. The team at Snappr was really easy to work with and got the right photographer selected for me, even sending me the photographer Nyki's portfolio, which closely aligned with my needs. The shoot was a breeze and I had received the photos very quickly following. All of the photos were not only high-quality but exactly what we were looking for. Our marketing team was elated. We will definitely be using them again.<//text>

I had a surprise proposal and I needed a photographer to capture and not missed such a important moment. I contacted Snappr and the process was super easy. They connected me with Hector who was super nice and flexible to my requirements. He captured the precise moment and he make sure the lighting, contrast and the colors were frame precisely with us. The value and the outcome I got was all worth it.< /Review>

Our experience was great and we would highly recommend Robb to anyone in need of a great photographer. He stayed in contact with us prior to the photo session, asked about what ideas we had,  and as well as offered suggestions. Very professional and easy to talk with. We will book Robb again!!!<//text>

< Review>
I had an absolutely amazing experience working with Snappr to book a top-notch photographer for a photo shoot. I had a particular vision in mind for the photo shoot and the photographer, Lisa, was super enthusiastic and committed to my vision. The final photos far exceeded my expectations and the turn-around time was much faster than I think most photographers would commit to getting photos back to me. I found the Snappr system easy to navigate and super convenient to review and download my photos afterward. I will definitely be a repeat customer and I'm recommending Snappr to friends!< /Review>

<text>This was my second time using Snappr for family photos. Both experiences we SO EASY, and I received beautiful pictures from each shoot. Did I mention how fast? Less than 48 hours later!!! AMAZING!!!! This year we had the pleasure of working with Dajuana - and she had the best eye when it came to helping us pose, and finding cool back drops in the outdoor space we were using. I have two small kids age 3 & 4 and Dajuana's calming presence and efficient approach kept everything moving right along, and also kept the kids engaged. I plan to use her in the future - and have received SO many compliments on our pictures. Most liked insta in feed post of the year by miles.<//text>< Rate>

Scheduling was simple and quick! Booking was an easy task. The shoot itself was awesome. Having taken several photography classes in the past I understand that making your subject feel comfortable during your shoot is very important. Snapr photographers are well-trained and do a great job cutting through the initial awkwardness of posing for pictures. My photographer was Olga, if you can, definitely book her!< /review>

< Review>
I found Snappr on google while looking for a photographer to shoot my  twins birthday party. This is the Uber of photo services but better. So convenient and the App is extremely user friendly. as well. I am a very busy mom and I can't tell you how this is a lifesaver. I hired Dajuanato shoot my twins Birthday and a few hours on Thanksgiving day and she was amazing. Very professional, warm easy to connect with. She blended right in with our family event without making any of the guests feel uncomfortable. The pictures turned out amazing and she really captured both Thanksgiving day and Kids birthday. So happy with that I found Snappr!</Review>

Snappr was a great find! I decided to get professional photos taken and one day later they were done and dusted with one very happy customer. I received. 63 photos and about 40 were actually ones I really liked. This % is unheard of as is the number of photos I received - especially for the price! Best $149 I've spent in a long time..... and I spend a lot!
Oscar my photographer was amazing - patient and a lighting expert into the bargain! So 5 costume changes later and one hour of my time  all was done! I received the photos two hours later on the same day! What a service. I recommend Snapr unreservedly. 5 stars simple as that.< /text>

We hired Deanna and she is a natural and nailed our candid pictures. We would definitely come back to snapper when we need a personal photo-shoot.</review>< Pics>

<Review>There is no reason to ever book another photographer except to use Snappr.  This is the best thing I have ever seen, I use Snappr for birthday parties, for my wedding.  Our photographer Brian was simply amazing, friendly, fun and most importantly extremely talented.  He was a pleasure to have at our wedding and got the most important shots.  Here’s the most important take away, you pay one flat fee and you get ALL of your photos, no extra charge at all.  Understand how costly it is to pay per photo with other photographers, thousands for a wedding.  With Snappr, they are your photos to keep.  You receive them within 48 hours of your shoot, not weeks later.

Snappr is a must, for every event.< /Review><user_id>111554275588865780625<//user_id>< rate>

Have your ever decided to do something for the first time, not knowing what to expect?  We did with Snappr, and we were extremely satisfied with the overall experience. After visiting the website and filling out some information, a personal representative called to answer some of my questions. Once we picked a date and time the photographer of choice reached me via text to introduce herself. On the day of the session Dajauna was energetic, and affirming which made for a great experience. We received our photos within 24 hours and they were all ours to keep.  Again extremely happy with the quality of the photos and the poses.< /text>

We were very happy with the service offered by snappr. After booking, our photographer Olga got in touch with us and everything went super smoothly from there on. She was on time for our family shoot, friendly and approachable, and made it a relaxing and fun experience! Our baby daughter loved her, and had a great time during the shoot. The pictures turned out wonderful, and we appreciated the care that went into them. Would definitely recommend Snappr, as well as our photographer in particular!<//Review>

<Review>Snappr is a great way to find a photographer for any type of photos! This is my second time using it when I needed a last minute photographer. My first book was with Kyle S. for a family shoot and the second was Samy P. For a bachelorette type shoot. Both turned out great & the photographers were flexible and accommodating to what we wanted. Booking is super easy, too! Highly recommend this company!< /Review><pics>None<//pics><response>None</response><GmapID>0x80c2b824cafd89f7:0xc9976e583ea4500d<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>We did not know where to find a photographer for our trip in LA, and we found Snappr and ended up with Sky who made us feel very comfortable and we had an overall great experience with our photoshoot. We are very happy with our photos. They are beautiful, very creative, and great quality. Thank you.</text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Can't ask for more! The photos that our wonderful, exceptionally talented photographer (Hector, an ex creative director looking for a more chill schedule) are beautiful, varied, and will serve us for many years to come. Thank you so much, Hector, for the creative direction and coaching!</review>

Booking through Snappr was very easy, not to mention Kaye from Snappr called me to follow up to ask if I needed any help. She was incredibly helpful and nice. She helped me book Roxanne T who blew my expectations out of the water. Very nice, professional and excellent quality of work. Would recommend 100X over. Thank you Snappr!
PS I usually don't write reviews, but my experience was so good I felt compelled!<//text>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>We actually called a number of studios in the area to find out pricing and availability for our wedding couple (including family) photoshoot, and then found Snappr.
We couldn't believe our luck. Not only were they willing to come out to our home to capture some home family pics but they also happily accommodated our request to have our wedding couple shoot at the Pasadena City Hall. We booked with Eunice who had great reviews. She was very communicative, and reached out promptly after booking her to understand the style of photos we wanted and the setting. I was honestly super impressed. She arrived promptly, made us all feel very comfortable and at ease. You could tell she was very confident and comfortable with her camera. Snapping away and giving us clear and concise instructions. Our photos were available for download within 48 hours from our photoshoot (which is unheard of today). When Eunice messaged to say my photos were ready for download with clear instructions on how to download them. I couldn't wait to open them, and WOW, we were absolutely blown away!!!
Eunice definitely knows how to capture the moments perfectly, artfully, gracefully, and elegantly.
We LOVE the photos, and can't stop raving about Snappr to family and friends!
Thank you Snappr!!!< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

<review>I just bought my first DSLR camera and wanted to understand how to use it. I saw the groupon for Isla's beginner photographer workshop and I bought it. The class was great. Mike was a great teacher. He made the class fun and easy to understand. I would highly recommend this for anyone starting out with a DSLR camera and wants to learn the basics.</review><pics>None</pics>< response>

<Text>The photographers and costumer service seem professional but that's only at the beginning, before you pay them. My experience with the photographer was poor and unprofessional, and the photos didn't come out looking professionally done, or like what I made clear I was looking for. However I was understanding and asked for a reshoot instead of my money back but it's been almost two weeks and I am still chasing after customer service. I would not recommend this service, it's worth paying a little extra for peace of mind and high quality photos.<//Text><pics>None</pics><response>None</response>< GmapID>

LOVED using Snappr for our product shoot. Not only are they quick, efficient and (very) reasonably priced but they also have quality industry professionals ready to jump in and get the job done well. Highly recommend  our photographer Casson as he was best in class, went above and beyond while giving our campaign the lens it needed. Thanks again Casson!</review>

This is my first time using Snappr.  Jennifer was my photographer.  She was absolutely perfect.  Not only is she a professional photographer, she also gave advise regarding what makeup would look best in the pictures.  We hired Jennifer to take pictures of 5 young ladies and their dates for their Prom.  We received a link to the pictures the very next day.  I highly recommend Snappr and will absolutely book with them again.</Review>

<Resp>None< /Resp><rating>5<//rating><review>This was the first time we used Snappr and I highly recommend them and would use again. We were traveling to the Atlanta area for the Thanksgiving holiday and I wanted some family photos taken while we were there. I reached out to a few local photographers but never heard back from any of them. That's when I stumbled upon the Snappr website. I entered my requests for family shots but wasn't certain about the location. A rep from the company called me to get clarification as to that I wanted and where and she paired us up with Marina.
Marina called me the day before our appointment and we discussed what I wanted for a family of 5 adults, we settled on a quaint little park and met there the next day. Marina was wonderful to work with. She quickly realized our personalities, had us laughing in no time, and went along with our families quirkiness, which helped get the lifestyle shots I wanted and not staged or overly posed pictures. She took a lot of pictures, edited some, made some black and white as we told her to use her discretion to do so, and she sent me the link to all of them within 48 hours which meant I got them on Thanksgiving Day.
I cannot say enough about how much I enjoyed this whole process. The company has proven wonderful and the photographer herself was spectacular. Oh yeah, the price can't be beat for the service and quality of photos you get!
Well done Snappr and Marina! 😊<//review>< time>

This is a unique and helpful website for quick, reasonable, professional photo shoots.  Their availability and flexibility of scheduling and location made it super easy.  My photographer, Doc, was quite helpful.  He made me feel at ease (I don't like having my picture taken...) and was accommodating with regard to back drops, poses, and looks.  He was enthusiastic about the shots and was extremely professional with regarding to lighting, finishing, and expressions.  It was actually fun!</text>

<Review>I had a very positive experience with Snappr last weekend. The photographer that we chose reached out ahead of time to hear more from me, followed up the day before our event, showed up early, was very present at our event, took great photos (great attention to detail and stylistic) and delivered them in under 2 days. The app was easy to use and I would highly recommend it.</Review>< Pics>

Roxanne was amazing!  Snappr was super easy to use and about half of the price of traditional photographers.  We just needed a few nice photos of us quickly (we are getting married in 6 months and need to send out save the dates!) and Roxanne more than delivered!  She’s a true artist!  Thanks Snappr and Roxanne!!< /Text>

His pictures were very professionally done-some and look like shots out of a magazine, I was so pleased!  Use Snapper, and Melvin to capture your photo shoots/events. Give them a try!!</review>

Our photographer Nicole was great and we received the photos in less than 48 hours. Her pictures were wonderful! And she got so many of them too. I mean, really SO many wonderful shots. I highly recommend her and will sure be using Snappr in our next family vacation!</review></record>

I booked Snappr as our photography service for our company holiday, and couldn't be happier with the service, the pictures, and especially the price paid for it all. It was a very easy process to get matched up with our photographer for our site in Eden Prairie, MN, and our photographer, Arnold R, was a great person to work with. He took some great candid shots, and even better, had the photos uploaded and ready for me to view by the next afternoon! I would definitely recommend Snappr, and Arnold R, to anyone looking for a photographer for any special event.< /Text>

Snappr was an awesome experience for us. We needed to book a photographer in less than 24 hours and we found an awesome one in Daniel. The experience was seamless and straightforward, asked you a bunch of questions based on what you are looking for, and then suggests a photographer and various time slots. And Daniel was awesome, knew his stuff and produced some really good shots of our product even with the limited resources we had (small room, inexperienced models). Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a photographer and has no idea where to start.<//Text>

Had a really good experience with Snappr. Needed photography last minute and we booked online. Our photographer Rocky was easy going and the kids liked him and bottom line, the photos came out great.

Cost effective and I would for sure use Snappr and Rocky again.<//Text>

Engaging Snappr saved our Company's Holiday Party, the Snappr UX and team (Joshua B.) is super helpful and easy. Our photographer Dajuana was such a great presence and make everyone feel at ease and comfortable. She took such great photos and we enjoyed our night and photos very much.<//Text>

<Text>Finally an affordable photography service with the same or better quality than we are used to.   Joshua called us in advance to talk about what we wanted.  He came to our house on time, was very personable and generous with the allotted time.  Our oldest son is severely autistic and Joshua was more patient with him than we were.  We got the photos that night and I was able to crop and play with them and take advantage of cyber Monday deals on cards the very next day.  This will now be our "go to" for family photos.<//Text>< Gmap_id>

Snappr really saved me! We needed a last minute quality photographer for an engagement party that was planned in 1 week and I found someone in my area literally 3 days before the event! Michael was incredible to work with and I love how the photos came out! He edited a ton of photos and sent over about 5 gigs of photos. Without him, we would remember this day so differently!< /review>

<text>“Sky was amazing! He shot my daughter’s sweet 16 birthday & I was not disappointed. What impressed me the most was how he moved through the event unobtrusively taking candid & posed for shots. I was expecting shots of singing happy birthday, speeches & dancing but what I didn’t expect were so many other special moments that I’d missed like my daughter seeing a dear friend she hadn’t seen in a while, her reaction to a poem her aunt read aloud, a story a sibling shared or a nervous look she had wondering how her mother would embarrass her next. Sky, through his photography, literally told a story of a special night we will never forget. He even captured the details of the decorations! I will hire Sky for every special occasion without hesitation!<//text><username>Connie Walker</username></record>

The process was so easy from requesting information to selecting the photographer.  We used Eric C. and I would highly recommend. Eric was always on time, professional, communicated, and took great pictures.  This was a last minute booking when our scheduled photographer cancelled.  I would use Snappr again.<//text>

I recently hired a photographer through Snappr to take photos for Ararat Jewelers, my father's Jewelry store. The platform was extremely simple and easy to use, connecting us with a great photographer in the Boston area, named David Bruno. Jewelry pictures are extremely hard to photograph, but David did a wonderful job!< /review>

<rate>5</rate><review>We really loved Dajuana Jones, whom Snappr rebooked us with, after our original photographer cancelled only 4 days prior to shoot, making us so unnecessarily worried that we'd be stuck with just phone pictures. Dajuana's work more than made up for the stress. She gave us an amazing set of pictures. We booked her for only an hour, but she got all the shots we needed, ran them by us, took some more, and we were good to go in 45 minutes (we really liked the efficiency!). Every single one of about 100 photos is stunning and there is nothing we would have changed about them. Her work with angles, light and pose guidance is absolutely wonderful! Oh, btw, this was contrast-edits only shoot, and the photos are all amazing! The fact that our budget pretty much dictated "Snappr or just phone pictures" made us that much happier that photos came out so great!< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

I had the best experience of my life everything went as planned. Also I had the best photographer ever his name was Sergio, he got the best angles, pictures,abd  the best coloring. He knew the best places to go make my pictures pop, he made my day very special and I'm going to use snapper again and him because, the price was just right,trust me I looked and I couldn't find anyone who could beat the prices. Thank you, Sergio.<//Review>

<user_name>Tony Eckert</user_name><review>I was shopping for photographers in the down town Chicago area. I spoke with a few companies whos prices seemed unreasonably high, though their work looked very good. When I found Snappr and began speaking with the salesperson, John, I became a bit skeptical considering how lower their prices were compared to others. John was professional and discussed the details of how their organization worked, he wasn't pushy as I was waiting on the venue to be completely booked for my engagement before I booked the photographer. He connected me with a few photographers and I eventually spoke with Charlie Brown. Charlie was a complete professional, detail oriented and sharp. We discussed the shots that we wanted on the phone and furthermore, I connected Charlie with my event planner and they were in constant contact from there. Charlie captured absolutely amazing pictures and made my fiance extremely happy. We couldn't have had a better experience and I recommend you call Snappr whether you are looking to capture a surprise engagement or any other event and if you need a photographer, make sure you ask for my man "Downtown Charlie Brown"!<//review><Time>1545842902921</Time></record>

I didn't know what to expect booking an event photographer for the first time using a website. Snappr's customer service was great over the phone. The price was fantastic. The photographer Jeremiah did a great job during the event. The photos were available online after 48 hours and they were excellent. I will use this service next time for sure.< /Text>

<Review>Snappr was very easy to navigate and helped me find a photographer for an event very quickly. The photos turned out FANTASTIC. Not only did Hector Puig, the photographer, capture the event, but the quality of the photos were amazing.

We used Snappr for the first time last weekend to capture some family photos and my 2 year old just wasn’t having it. Sandra, our photographer, was so kind and patient thoughout the entire experience.  Despite my sons sour mood and crying, Sandra was able to get some really good pictures. We are very happy and will definitely reach out to Snappr and Sandra again when we are ready for more pictures.< /Text>

<Text>Snappr Photography is the most amazing photographer. She was my photographer for my engagement pictures and now for newborn pictures. I would say she is the baby whisperer, my 10 day old went in wide awake and Snappr Photography had her quiet and sleeping in 5 mins. She is amazing and everyone should go see her!!</Text>< Pictures>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>Snappr has to be the best photographer finding website out! While in LA on business my husband & I had wanted a photo shoot somewhere iconic. We chose Snappr bc it’s no fuss & professional. Our photographer Roxanne T.  (5 star rated) was everything you want in a photographer. She was friendly, patient & funny. She got our sense of humor & let us be ourselves. Our pictures turned out beautiful!!!! Great turn around time too. We will definitely use them again if in LA or (their other locations).</Text>< Pics>

<review>Great concept for scheduling and booking a professional photographer. I have a small business and needed pictures of my business to attract more clients and traffic. And with the photographer I booked, Arnold, the experience surpassed my expectations. I will be booking more services with them due the facility and quick turnaround to get the material.< /review><response>None<//response></record>

<Text>Selman Pinarli came out to our business to do a product shoot on the day we were shipping off several of our newest products to Amazon.  He was very professional, super flexible, and helped us with the creative display of our products.  His suggestions were spot on and we got some great quality photos which were perfect for what we wanted.  I would recommend him and this service to anyone!< /Text>< Rating>

This was my first experience using Snappr. The company is essentially the third party vendor to help match you with a photographer that's right for your event. Whether it's a wedding, personal family shoot, corporate event etc - they will match you with someone in your area and connect you with them. You receive an event link where all your photos will be after the event.
We got connected with Joshua for a business event in Washington DC and he was wonderful to work with. His angels, lighting, candid and posed shots etc were all perfect. My bosses were thrilled to have such great shots documenting their event. I was also very pleased with the fact that our photos were ready within 24 hours and we had full downloading rights to ALL photos.

Snappr makes it easy to find a photographer in your area without having to do too much research. You're matched based on the needs of your event.< /Text>

We are based in the Uk and work a lot with musicians in the US. I managed to set up a photoshoot at a gig in LA via Snappr all the way from the Uk! Great Service, Easy to do. Snappr listened to everything I was after and then provided a photographer that best suited that. The photographer they sent was Alberto. He was amazing and has a great eye. Not only did Alberto listen to my instructions of what we wanted photo wise but he also provided so much more! Great Photos, Great eye, Great Service. Will keep using Snappr to organize all my photoshoots.<//text>

<Text>My photo shoot was great in Houston and I got it for a decent price for 1 hour all inclusive. My photographer David C. was amazing, he also was extremely patient with my family and I, which I greatly appreciated. If I ever need a photographer again, I will use Snappr again and I would prefer if David C. photographed my family each and every single time. Thank you David C. for the beautiful photos and your patience. You were a God sent on a special day for my family and I.< /Text>< name>

I needed a photographer last minute for family holiday photos and discovered snappr. It saved ma and my photographer, Alfonso, was very professional and easy to work with.  He took so many photos that we have lots of options to work with.  I would definitely use this service again as it was much more affordable than your standard photo shoot and so easy to use.</Text>

Despite my double booking (my fault) photographers, Snappr corrected and quickly arranged for Delana to come to our house for the photos.  She had great cameras and was very thorough with a variety of photos after choosing the best light -- which was outside.   She was able to modify the photos for the background and quickly provided me with a great selection to choose from.   Very good communication and an easy peasy way to get professional photos at a reasonable price.</review>< resp>

<resp>None</resp><Review>This was our 1st experience using Snappr.  I came across Snappr when Googling for a photographer for my Granddaughter's baptism.  I requested and received an immediate quote online that was extremely reasonable.  Snappr recommended a few photographers in the area of the shoot.  After reviewing each, we chose our photographer, Jeremiah, who was well rated by other customers on the site.  We made our appointment and received immediate confirmation for the shoot.   Very easy booking transaction.  We received a confirmation reminder email the day before the shoot.  On the day of the shoot, Jeremiah arrived early and we scoped out the best areas for taking photos.  He was very helpful and patient as my 18 month old granddaughter was full of energy and into everything that day.  The day was beautiful as well as the grounds of Wayfarer's Chapel.  Jeremiah did an excellent job capturing all the special moments of the ceremony and we could not be happier with the results. He is a true, skilled professional.  We are most impressed with the service we received from Snappr and Jeremiah.  I will use them again and again.  They really fit the need for what we were looking for.  A 1 hour shoot of our special event at a very reasonable fee.  Great service! A+++<//Review></record>

I used Snappr to photograph a community Halloween party with over 60 guests with children in attendance. There were so many elements to capture in just two hours - décor, games, costumes, babies, children, parents, varying outdoor lighting, and all the moments of candid interactions.  Our photographer Jean Marie did an amazing job and documented it all beautifully! Every step of the Snappr experience truly exceeded my expectations from start to finish – seamless, fast, and easy. I will definitely use Snappr again!</Review>

Awesome experience with Snappr. My pics were ready super quick and the service of meeting at a location of my choice was awesome. Photos turned out really good and AJ was the best...super patient when trying to capture our furry family member and really worked to get good shots! The only thing I wish snappr had was the ability to print/frame photos online. I will definitely use Snappr again!< /text>

Experience was so easy. PhotoGraphers found instantly via your location, they contact you a day before the shoot, then upload all the pictures to an online gallery to easily be shared with friends. Our photographer Lorraine was super nice and accomadated all our needs!</Review>

<Review>Having attempting to create a memorial service program pamphlet myself, I was dissatisfied with the outcomes of my results since I am  not so artistically talented.  After a few days, I called Snappr Photography for assistance and rushed over.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

<review>Recently used snappr for my engagement photos. Couldn't have asked for better service. It was completely user friendly. My original photographer had canceled and snappr immediately found me another photographer, Rocky. Rocky and snappr killed it! My family loved the photos, the work, and everything else that was involved with the photography. Highly recommend snappr and will definitely use in the future.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

< review>
I live in Georgia and  needed a photographer during a short trip to Los Angeles during the New Year holiday.  I booked a photographer for a last minute shoot (three days in advance)  using Snappr. The photographer (Dujuana J)  immediately reached out and confirmed the shoot.  She asked for specific details on my vision for the shoot and asked me to text examples.  The day of the shoot, she was very patient while we looked for the perfect outdoor spot to shoot.
Dujuana was excellent at providing direction to my 16 year old to obtain many different poses.  She was verry friendly and very professional.  The photographs were available to me in less than 24 hours after the shoot.  I was extremely satisfied with the final images.  I would definitley use Snappr photography again and recommend Snappr to friends and family.<//review>

Very good massage parlor. The employees are professional and well trained. The ambiance is relaxing and they have nice music. My neck massage was thorough and the pain hasn't returned for quite some time. Highly recommend this place.</Text>

It truly is relaxing there. It's quiet, dim lighting, hot foot baths & heated massage tables. The massage therapists are all fantastic, they really do a great job. The customer service is good too, everybody is super nice.
I always have hard muscles & knots. Every time I leave I feel so much better. They do excellent deep tissue.< /Text>

She wore a beaded necklace. I got the combo, she massaged my feet then took me to the back room. Once we were there, I thought that she would apply more pressure to take out my knots instead she made me feel worse.Towards the middle of the massage she got on top of me put her whole body on top of me and groped me. I felt it was very inappropriate. Do not go here.</Review>< Pics>

Very friendly staff, clean and quiet (for the most part). There was some background noise while I was getting my scalp and foot massage that was a little distracting. But the massage felt amazing and I left feeling very relaxed!<//Text>

<review>Very friendly. Atmosphere very tranquil. I phoned ahead for an appt and got in right away. The also have an electronic system where you tell them how hard to massage and focus on what area of the body. Highly reccomend. Also they're prices are budget friendly. I'm referring all my friends and coworkers to them.<//review>< Pics>

<Rating>1<//Rating><text>The language barrier isn't the problem.  What really is upsetting is that person who was "massag" me, basically was just kneading me. Gave a good back massage, didn't touch my feet at all, or any of my problem areas.  Why bother asking what they are? When all was done, I was forced to give a tip. I gave her a $20 asking for change, she only gave me a $10 back.  I asked for the rest of it, she just said, "tip."  I don't recommend!</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<review>If it was possible to rate my experience with 10 stars, I would!  Johnetta Magee and Xceed have been extremely helpful and have gone out of their way to assist and communicate.  Xceed is a very customer-service-friendly organization and I would choose them again for my financial partner.  Two thumbs up 👍 👍 !</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

I currently got an auto loan through Xceed financial. I purchased an F150. My loan processor was Alfredo Reyes from the El Segundo branch in California. I just wanted to thank him and Xceed Financial for the most pleasant loan experience. I had many questions. And he happily answered them all for me. I had contacted him numerous times to make sure I understood the paperwork. He was always available and made sure I understood everything in my contract. When I found the vehicle I wanted to purchase he did a very thorough job making the dealership provide the documentation to make sure I was getting the best deal and was not overpaying for the vehicle. Alfredo and Xceed went above my expectations and provided First Class service that you will not receive from your average bank. Even though the dealership may not have liked all the paperwork he wanted them to send before he approved my loan to ensure the LTV was below 100%. I can appreciate that he was looking out for my best interest and will be switching all my banking to them . I also will be recommending Xceed Financial to my Co-workers in Army. Thanks again!

Came to try to open an account with this CU cuz of my job is the primary CU. Horrible service there was no one in the office and the counter girls was laughing having fun one guy step out of he’s desk and the other one was making phone calls. Seems like they ignored me and the lady that I talk to before was at lunch. So frustrated.<//Text>

Came here for breakfast and service was quick and friendly.  There were plentiful breakfast options for me and my vegetarian friend and we had the breakfast burrito and breakfast tacos.   Both dishes tasted excellent and the chips and salsa were also tasty.</text>

Big portions. Home cooked kind of feel to the food. Really like the beans. They give you chips and salsa while you wait. I had a chimichanga and really liked it. I think I liked their enchiladas even more though. Would recommend, it's a good sit down place.</review>

I really want to like this place given the convenience of their location. Around DB, I am grateful for any semblance of a decent eatery. I appreciate little things like utensils with my takeout order. Perhaps this place is Eco-conscious? The Asada burrito was pretty good but the nacho supreme was mediocre, at best. The guacamole was bland. The chicken and beans hardly had little flavor. The whole thing was smothered in grease. I am giving this place an inflated rating because my friends all love this joint. I am giving this place the benefit of their doubt.<//review>

The Whole Enchilada will never be my favorite place to eat, but you could do a lot worse. There's nothing terrible that ruins it for me, but still. The food is, generally, pretty bland and I've sampled quite a bit of it. Don't get me wrong, it is not bad, just a bland for my taste. On a positive note, I have never had a negative service experience there. Not even when I've just stopped in for take-out.<//Text>

My first thought was outdated and cheesy, but waiters were super friendly and the food was like I remember original Mexican food to be like and the place was full of Happy customers who seemed to love the place and some even know each other. By the time I left being super satisfied I was in love with the Decor and the Hawaiian shirts, it kinda felt like I was on a VAY CAY< /text>

Did not feel authentic. I had a works burrito with carne asada. The meat is good. I did like the guac, rice, chips, and desert. The cheese and sauces lacked flavor and spices. It is worth the price as the plate is big and very filling.<//review>

This place is like a tradition in the city of Diamond Bar. It may not be the BEST mexican food you've ever had, but it's good, and the atmosphere is great. The people are happy, and it just feels like a home-y little restaurant!</Review>

Covid vaccine for public, in-doors for those who don't prefer open spaces and in through car. They have you sign information, ask for insurance and  qualification(work or health condition), and quickly wait in line then administer your shot. If you have the chance its a great opportunity to get vaccinated.</Review>

<Review>There seems to be activities and programs for kids to keep active or out of trouble. Came here to enroll for swim lessons. The line process was terrible. U have to wait in line outside the building, where years B4 u get the forms and all enters the building. Standing in line outside on a chilly summer day for 1.5 hour was not good.  $30 swim lessons. Oh, there was a pet clinic that day. This place offers stuff to the community.</Review><date>1529241478962</date><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMluqaib-PYmb4mJoGOmZwdaI1LubFf5cOUmCRn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOMrLTlkhKAUie6rwi7yyX4q1M2vDhudcTa8kwN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP8ZNFmW8xC-YN9sj8Gg7A6xCh2uotxrWi58pbB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP1oWXJRNuR-0MW6FkbN4QOg_tBmaGbCGK6Fz5q=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPl69l1RGSxr1fqYNns0H152QmJkaz9H8QBVreR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMEXudPwtSSzJUlPAH63L28NXsWb8qHQFGwjqcY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOfja__SA4xV27xkcWh7NZ3mw5gxZyQi6ML9Cvg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOvUEqAx8r9AF3GVVCRcg9prywUHuG3_rVhitrg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN5U2JjMWE6h6YKTDqed1YM2aayZHbM6zwQhAdu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNMqwPEw_i_jFT-BLUKkVRp0pae1Lvru8i0U2cs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMWwoBSA7eN7OnNatsyEZVQJM-CgnUm38eq_vyy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNmnzhmdjA5aKkdXjjkmvOkH_I6YfeuKa0B0XP1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM_cXYeJ71VRnkmbQpzMbmlJHD-P3mz4t8NJeR3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOEMB6rL4DrahqilnFoUKdI5fNuLOoUlOhRYF_O=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN2fX9KMdy1PMMjY4ZDd9dyhbIpgR7qGcWpo8nA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMMbGQay2hPzfVAnqec0_nvpTjlfdMaRjSs1mqf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMn1GbGQ4qWwT5hP_JvkxTyK15EAiULPb0J6-D7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< user_id>

<rating>5< /rating><review>Great lovely place with wonderful people. Located at the club house inside McInnis Golf course, it’s a nice hideaway with great outdoor patio dining while enjoying the range. My personal favorite is the Prosciutto and Fig pizza. The homemade dough is just amazing.

Note: Due to Covid-19, the restaurant is available for take out or delivery although i do think it might open for outdoor dining soon.</review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNXhGyVRditRaDP10S0Bzo4VJQRddS-HBx2sJux=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM2FNhCS9BQpRX1tVLYrRdEBP3_g7swGGtw9QBz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< response>

Very polite friendly helpful staff with comfortable seating. The burgers and their salads are very well prepared as well.. Features a relaxing golf course as well as an even more relaxing driving range next door.< /Text>

<review>Went to a company holiday party in the private room here. Awesome place! Good lighting, felt very cozy. There's a great area for a DJ and dancing. Lots of room to go around the room and mingle with people. Also, saw people in the driving range so it's good they have their facilities open pretty late so you can do all sorts of activities. Very nice area.< /review>< time>

I particularly enjoy the fried calamari with one of their salads.  The butter lettuce salad is great and so is the caesar.

Took quite awhile to get our drinks, didn't get any bread on the table, and even had to ask for dressing for my wife's salad.  I've been there plenty of times and this was not the norm.  This is usually a good place for a couple of drinks and decent food.< /review>< pictures>

Most people don’t even know it’s there. Varied menu and the food is good the atmosphere is low-key & quiet. The service is good it’s quick the prices are reasonable and it’s convenient being local.
One of my favorite dishes is the Asian skirt steak that’s a really good choice of meat and flavorful $24 with vegetables well worth the money.
There is a full bar there are always people at the bar. It’s a good place to meet some friends and watch a game or just meet friends and shoot the breeze. There are some  “regulars” but it’s a nice crowd, quiet it’s an easy place to relax and enjoy a fine meal.
There is also a daily dinner specials check it out you won’t be disappointed.<//review><Date>1543371412232</Date></record>

Great local spot... the food is always great... Daily specials change often, and service is impeckable. Patio dining is nice once the weather warms up.</review>

<text>Slooooowwww service. We showed up for after work drinks and our server was more interested in getting her station ready than taking our order. Thet was literally nobody at a table but us.

So we ordered at the bar, and the server decided to ignore us after that. We work minutes away, I won't go back.< /text><user_id>107340217967925881206</user_id><gmap_id>0x8085983c7215a05d:0xcd22b5b369c5b268< /gmap_id>< Rate>

The new salesman was wonderful to work with. Gave honest opinions, complemented on our good Tate. Showed jewelry with expertise. Very efficient..  His co worker was not so helpful, might have been the manager on duty.  The new I'd definitely a keeper with management potential. We will come to shop when he is working. It was a complete pleasurable shopping experience.

Excellent Service! The store has really turned around from the way it used to be. Everything is more organized and store is cleaner and feels more welcoming. New manager is doing a great job! There's more clothes out and they are organized in a way that makes it easier to find what you're looking for. Great prices, will be shopping here again.<//Text>

I have never been so impressed with a thrift store. Definitely my new favorite spot! So many of the clothes are still in great/new condition and you can find great name brands!</text>

Love this place. Awesome people who don't discriminate.  Also, they don't hover over you when you are donating... Like Goodwill when donating furniture etc.< /Text>

Excellent costumer service.  The manager was very helpful, polite and pleasant. ( very impressed) The store is very organized and clean. I have been to many thrift stores and find that their  prices are more like department stores and find them to be unorganized.   Here at Hope of the Valley the prices are very reasonable and alot of the merchandise are new... I will definitely be shopping here again. I really enjoyed my experience at this store and will definitely  be donating my items here as well.< /Review>

OMG this shop is so cool with friendly staff. I was confused about some clothing i was looking for and the manager took her time to help me find exactly what i needed. I will definitely be back and will recommend this place to friends and family. Thank u for the smiles and the perfect outfit i needed.</Text>

Cool place. Probably one of the most organized clothing selection seen at any thrift store. They organize everything by size, color, and type or clothing which makes for a rather pleasant shopping experience unlike many thrift stores.</Text>

Best price.. Have gone to numerous thrift shops in the valley and this shop has the best prices.  Back staff are not too helpful or friendly... Need dressing rooms.. not 1 bathroom as a dressing room.. tacky.  Front staff-cashiers are great.< /text>

A great thrift store that has great service, and great shoes. All is affordable, and I tend to find more stuff here than goodwill :)

The 4 stars is because there is only one dressing room, and there are days that there are a lot of loud kids (it is out of the store's control obviously, but having kids throwing balls around while I'm shopping takes away from the experience for me).</Review>

<Rating>3< /Rating><review>Pretty well organized thrift store as far as clothing is concerned (throughout the middle of the store).  A lot of categories around the edges, but plenty of stuffed in nooks & crannies that make hunting around "a must" if you're looking for that unusual "find".  Proceeds all for a good cause - to help provide human-need services through Hope of the Valley to people in who may be mist in need of a helping hand.< /review><GmapID>0x80c29ade79ea5aa9:0xe4a60afc50b83a73<//GmapID><name>Burton Hunter<//name><pictures>None< /pictures>< user>

Apathetic, uncaring management. We drove nearly an hour in LA traffic to donate goods. Website clearly states donations are taken until 7pm.

We arrived shortly after 5:30pm and were told "sorry, we stop taking donations at 5:30pm." We advised them their website says otherwise. They did not care one iota. Store manager? She left for the day.

More criminals living off the backs of the homeless. Avoid, stay away, do not donate. It is not appreciated.</Text>

Second bad experience here! After cashier with long, long lines refuses to call for more help and laughs when his register computer goes down.
Then when I get to the front of the line, he puts a 45 cent surcharge on my debit card without telling me. Very sneaky and probably not legal.
Stick with the Salvation Army better deals and they don't try to scam you at the cash register.< /text>

Make sure you ask about their return policy. They wiill not refund money nor give you store credit.  I relied on thier honesty that the electronic I bought was working fine and it didn't even work! Futhermore the young cashier was rude with no good manners.</Text>

<review>Thank you Joel for coming out so quickly and fixing our gate! Our gate was stuck open and turns out it was because of a black widow blocking the sensor!! He showed me a picture and I’m just glad it wasn’t me that found it. He also fixed our code issue and explained several cool features that we weren’t even aware of! Highly recommend to anyone who has gate or garage issues!!<//review>< Resp>

Robert has given an excellent service to our property commercial gate operators for the last 2 years. He has performed different jobs on our metal gates, leaving them working at its best. He is a very knowledgeable tech on commercial doors.  Respectful and efficient!< /review>

Joel arrived quickly (on a Sunday) and gave me a quick and understandable explanation of what went wrong with my door. His service was quick and complete. His service has text message confirmation and he was able to email my receipt quickly after the service.

The service solved a garage door stuck half way on a Sunday which I anticipated would be a huge pain and resolved it so quickly and easily it seems a dream.

Thank you Joel.< /Text>

<name>Michelle Tacawy< /name><text>Joel made my day! I called several other garage door repair companies for quotes and was told all sorts of things, like that I’d have to replace my garage door and was quoted 4x the amount Joel quoted for a tune up! He offered to do a tune up and to quote estimates for repairs. He came within a couple hours of my call and worked miracles! I never thought my garage door could be this quite and smooth. He even went above and beyond and cleaned my cover plate. I am so grateful for him! Great work!!<//text>< UserId.>

What’s not to like?  My old garage door wouldn’t budge, he came out last minute to fix it and all he did was adjust the sensors...don’t laugh- I’m a widow and haven’t had to deal with this stuff!  No charge for coming out on a Monday night after hours—that’s the best kind of service!<//Text>

< Review>
I had an issue with my garage door. I found Tip Top Door, am i glad i did. Matt the technician came out  almost immediately, and diagnosed the problem, and proceeded to actually show me the issue, not only did he fix the issue, he also tightened the door sensors , made sure they were aligned, and totally lubricated the entire door and unit, while fixing the original problem,  and then the price came, and i thought WOW, unbelievably reasonable,  the price  was ALOT less than i expected, and Matt is truly a professional, cordial, Honest, etc. the door works perfectly, and talk about quiet, This is the best experience that i have had for someone to come to my house to fix an issue, all around. I posted this comment through my Sons Google account, my Name is Ed from Escondido. I know this any future issues that may come up, Tip Top Door and Matt the tech is who i am going to get. Have a Good Day,   Ed<//Review>

I had an emergency garage door that would not fully open and made a screeching noise.  I called TipTop Door and Gate Service. Joel answered the call and said he could be at my home with 15 minutes.. He was and was so professional and informative and the door was fixed at a very fair price and in a very timely manner.  Highly recommend their services.<//text>

Great company! Very responsive and prompt service. Our garage door wouldn’t open one day, and they came out within 30min, fixed 1 hour later. Now, it’s even better than it was before. Matt was friendly, helpful, and very professional. Highly recommend! Thank you, Tip Top Doors!< /Text>

Joel and the other tech came out on a Friday night to help us. Service was fast and impeccable. We actually had a few things that needed corrected and they had all the parts available in their truck. Now our door is quiet, smooth, and issue free. Will be calling them in the future when we’re ready for our garage door to have an aesthetic face lift.<//review>

Quality work, excellent customer service, and perfect communication. Joel is very knowledgeable and great at keeping us updated on the job. They automated our gate and finished fencing in around the gate. They did fantastic work and I am extremely pleased with the company. I will be using them again as well as referring them to others in the future.</Review>

Phil and Matt are fantastic people.  A honest and experienced team. Scheduled appointment same day. Matt came out and provided a "no pressure" service with options that we could take advantage of now or in the future.  He programed the car's HomeLink system to the new opener and made sure everything was in good order.  We love our new garage door opener and appreciated the service. Thank you Tiptop Door!<//review>

Joel is a real professional! 30 yrs fixing garage doors! He wants you as a customer for life. He works nights and weekends, our garage spring broke and I went on home advisor and had several calls immediately. I was taking notes and information on what product and warranty and Joel really new his product. He said he can come out tonight (Sunday night 8:00pm) after replacing the spring he said the bearings were worn out and were making a grove in the rod which will eventually cut through and break. He said he can slide the rod through further if I didn’t want to fix it now. It needed to fixed so he fixed that. He then saw the door was bowing putting a lot of strain on the motor. He said he has a piece of sheet metal back in Ocenside and he would go get it and fix it tonight. He did it. He earned my business anytime I need my garage door repaired!</review>

Phil came out on a Saturday and was here ON TIME. (Amazing)  He told me on the phone of the specials for tune ups they had going and I felt it was a great deal.  When Phil arrived I was pleased to see he was covid compliant for my safety and was ready to work.  After going through the evaluation of my garage door and the opener he diagnosed my problem within minutes.(speaks to their years of experience and knowledge)
After fixing my problem I called him out for, he shared with me other things that may occur down the road and DID NOT hit me with a high pressure sales pitch, but gave me the freedom to decide when I was comfortable to make any repairs and improvements.
This was a great beginning to a future business relationship when I need to call for future garage door repair.  Thanks again Phil.<//text>

I had previously purchased a new garage door opener. Phil came out and found that my old one only needed a minor repair and that the new one would not be strong enough for my current door. He showed me what needed to be done with the door. This was the main issue not my opener. He repaired the opener, put in new springs and other minor repair. He had told me if the new opener was installed, the door would need to be repaired either way.Saved me $$$ for sure. Definitely worth having him do it this way. Thanks Phil for the great work. Hope you enjoyed the meatball sandwich!</review>< Date>

I'm very pleased with this company. They did a great job at my parent's house in Vista. Their drive-way gate wouldn't open 90% of the time. I called Tiptop and they came out for a free consultation that same day. The issue was difficult to identify but they found it and even came back on a Sunday to do the repair. They are honest and reasonably priced. Thank you Tiptop, we will definitely be calling you back if needed and will be recommending you to our friends.</Review>

<text>We call them and ask for estimate (for Free). Same day they drop by and give us our estimate in minutes thru email. So I called their line in the evening, expecting to just leave a Voice message for tomorrow but Surprisingly someone (Phil) answer it right away and put us in schedule the next day. That quick and easy. Matt is exceptional, he did the repair and made sure that everything is functioning well before leaving.  Overall, I couldn’t be any happier with their service. More power to y’all.< /text>< Name>

Phil was great. I messed up my Marantec garage door settings and he spent 5 minutes on the phone walking me through the adjustment. Other companies would have charged me a service fee and need to make an appointment, but he helped me out. I have added Tiptop Door Service to my approved service request list. If the service I received over the phone is any indicator to their in-person servicing than I believe they would take great care of you.<//review>

Phil did an outstanding job while repairing my garage door. He was at my house within 20 minutes of me calling and was extremely friendly the whole way. Not only did he repair my door, he educated me on all of the working parts of my door and gave me pointers on what to look out for. I highly recommend Tiptop to anyone who needs the services they provide, they definitely will not disappoint.< /Text>

Tiptop Door and Gate Service get 5+ stars from me.  This company should be the only one you call for door repairs.  They provide friendly, professional and fast service.  From the person on the phone to dispatch to Phil, the technician I am very satisfied with the good old fashioned GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE.  I called several other companies that advertised emergency service.  Tiptop is the only company that was willing to help.  THANK YOU Phil!  We need more people like you in the service repair industry.<//Text>

<review>Phil of Tip Top Door Service knows his work! We originally wanted a new gate installation. Phil was also going to provide a tune up to our existing gate opener as well. Once we saw how expensive it was for a brand new gate, we asked if it was possible to renovate ours. We asked and Tip Top delivered. Not only did we get a nicely renovated gate, he provided us with ideas on how to create a walk through gate with the existing leftovers of our current gate! He listened to our needs and provided each and every one of our items with professionalism, craftsmanship and efficiency. If you want more than just a gate provider, but a professional who knows the mechanics of gate construction and the dynamics of a secure structure that will work wonderfully, look no further than Tip Top Door Services. Amazing!</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

< review>
Professional, courteous, timely and exceptional service.

I'm usually skeptical about calling in people I've not worked with, but since my garage door broke two days before Xmas late night, I yelped and called them (third in the search - the other listings ahead of them did not pick up although they claimed 24/7). They took down my details and had a technician in 30mins.

Phil identified the problem, clearly explained the situation and solution. He had it resolved in under 30mins also fixing additional problems which I had been having for a while. The whole process was contact free.

I usually don't write reviews unless I'm thoroughly impressed. I'm extremely pleased and I'd recommend them for any garage door services..<//review>

<Review>We called Tip Top Garage services and were surprised how fast and efficient he was in replacing our broken garage door. Phil (with 20 yrs of experience) arrived on Monday, 2020 Labor Day, determined the problem showed me the broken parts, no longer available, on my 13 yr. old unit. He came fully equipped to replace my failed unit.  He also provided additional assistance setting up my Cell Phone with the latest App to control and monitor this garage door. He also did preventative maintenance on our larger 2 car garage at no charge. He has a wealth of information to share.  I feel very comfortable recommending his service.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

We've had them service our garage door on several occasions. The serviceman showed up on time, each time and was incredibly enjoyable to work with. He was very engaging, funny and a total expert.  He knew exactly what was wrong with our door the first time (wrong size spring was on heavy door and causing stress till breakage).

We had them come back and insulate the door and what a difference! Quieter and way less hot in the garage now. We had them come a third time to install a WiFi system for the opener. They took the time to grease the door and check it again for maintenance at no extra charge.

We have recommended them to other friends and family and they too have felt the service and prices were the highest level possible.

We have even had opportunity to interact with the owner. She is sweet and very customer-minded.

Can't say enough good stuff about this company. You will NOT regret working with them.

Honest. Genuine. Competitively priced. No BS or underhanded up sells.

UPDATE: We moved out of state and bought a house. We were having garage door issues and I called Tip Top even though we weren’t even in their state anymore - the technician spent over an hour on the phone with me diagnosing the problem and then telling me how to fix it!!  After doing what I was instructed to do, it was mostly fixed but wasn’t perfect. On that next weekend, he called me back and helped me get it right. No charges, just good customer service. Wow!<//text><Gmap_id>0x80dc71031854232f:0x487980996302c1ef<//Gmap_id></record>

I took it in Sunday, looked brand new Monday. Awesome job, and the price was reasonable given the amount of time they got it done.. I had an android, so it cost me more than an iPhone. Great service overall!< /text>

<text>Great prices, but be careful here. Ask her to test every function before dropping off, and at pickup. Arrived with a broken screen, left with a new screen and no GPS. Called the next day to hear yelling that the two issues are unrelated and I should Google the antenna location, It must've been already broken before...ect. (I used GPS to drive there in the first place). Came in to hear more arguing, then paid to replace the antenna at a steep discount. In the end was ok, but a lot of stress involved.<//text>< Pictures>

I dropped my iPhone 7 plus on the street, brought to Apple to get the estimate. I was told around $350 to get it fixed. After calling some repair places, I decided bring to this store, she only charged me $85 to get the whole screen and LCD replacement in 30 minutes. My phone is so far so good now. Thank you.</text>

<text>Walked in with one issue (which they did fix) on my phone and walked out with 2 that my phone did not have before. Also they kept my phone WAY too long than told it would take. Pointed out the 1st issue and they couldn't fix it, and days later now I have discovered a 2nd one, But at this point I don't want to waste more time or gas. I will accept my losses.< /text>< user_name>

<UserId.>103555025444304326344< /UserId.><Text>Great prices, but be careful here. Ask her to test every function before dropping off, and at pickup. Arrived with a broken screen, left with a new screen and no GPS. Called the next day to hear yelling that the two issues are unrelated and I should Google the antenna location, It must've been already broken before...ect. (I used GPS to drive there in the first place). Came in to hear more arguing, then paid to replace the antenna at a steep discount. In the end was ok, but a lot of stress involved.<//Text>< Name>

I texted you and called your store several times to wait for me and no reply and it just went to voicemail.  Your ad says you close at 6:30pm and you closed at 6pm.  I was there at 6:10pm because I was stuck in traffic.  Please at least text me back or return my call that you can not wait for a customer so they are not stuck in traffic and wasting time and gas.  Plus thank you for charging me $65 when your ad says $60 for ipad air screen repair.<//review><user>103205185781919107862< /user>< Pictures>

I took it in Sunday, looked brand new Monday. Awesome job, and the price was reasonable given the amount of time they got it done.. I had an android, so it cost me more than an iPhone. Great service overall!</Review>

Came by to repair my iPhone 5s screen and wasn't disappointed. Every other place was charging me $50 to repair a screen, while this place only did it for $40. Customer service is also on point. Highly recommend!</review>

<review>CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP.. Took two iPhones, IPhone 7s plus & IPhone 7. Cheap Chinese LCD glows white a lot, my SCREEN went bad after 3 Weeks & they WOULDN'T FIX IT. They Claim in their Store 30Days Warranty & said (Older Asian/Philippine Guy:  "Sorry, you dropped it" & smiled good luck... BAD Business! when I had it @ home charging in my work desk. They would charge me $70 extra to fix again 😡 Being Cheap Stuff they install, decided to go else where with Close to Stock Original Screen. Business Cash only = No proof & illegal. Business Shall Accept CASH, Debit/ Credit, Optional Not most places receive Checks. Took my iPhone else where & they don't know how to SEAL THEM BACK TO WATTERPROOF, LOCKED WET INSIDE & PARTS WHERE LOOSE & MISSING!

Great prices, but be careful here. Ask her to test every function before dropping off, and at pickup. Arrived with a broken screen, left with a new screen and no GPS. Called the next day to hear yelling that the two issues are unrelated and I should Google the antenna location, It must've been already broken before...ect. (I used GPS to drive there in the first place). Came in to hear more arguing, then paid to replace the antenna at a steep discount. In the end was ok, but a lot of stress involved.</Review>

<text>I dropped my iPhone 7 plus on the street, brought to Apple to get the estimate. I was told around $350 to get it fixed. After calling some repair places, I decided bring to this store, she only charged me $85 to get the whole screen and LCD replacement in 30 minutes. My phone is so far so good now.

<Text>Hello Sir

I texted you and called your store several times to wait for me and no reply and it just went to voicemail.  Your ad says you close at 6:30pm and you closed at 6pm.  I was there at 6:10pm because I was stuck in traffic.  Please at least text me back or return my call that you can not wait for a customer so they are not stuck in traffic and wasting time and gas.  Plus thank you for charging me $65 when your ad says $60 for ipad air screen repair.</Text>< gmapID>

This is another fantastic breakfast spot. The pancakes of the month are always a hit! As of June 2018 it's Oreo! My daughter devoured them quickly. No..no...Sharing wasn't an option for her. Anyways....The Desperado with the pork green sauce was a hit for me. It's not spicy at all and it packs a ton of flavor. This is a place great spot to eat at if you're in the area.</review>

<text>This is my fifth visit at Le Peep since they opened and every time the experience is more pleasant.
Delicious food and coffee, friendly staff, wonderful decoration, and very clean. High quality food and decent prices.
I customized my own plate this visit by asking for a weird combination of items and the server took it with a smile!! So happy to have this addition to the neighborhood with a walking distance from home! Will definitely keep coming back</text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM9b8eIB_1VOV2MsEwwDBFE5M2Exjo7aDNZtIkF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMZ8KbB9zjjR07yRvvZNjRpDvhRxoxp5BbLsxu7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

We like Le Peeps because it's close to our home and we walk here. They also are dog friendly on the patio. We had a delicious breakfast. It is true, there have been new owners for the past two months. Some of the staff is the same. We got here at 11am on a Saturday and missed the rush.< /Review>

My first time here for lunch. However, I've enjoyed breakfast at Le Peep many times. My wife and I sat out on the patio and split the Triple Decker sandwich with waffle fries. It was Great. The bacon was crisp and the bread was soft and toasted. Delicious. Also can't say enough about the waffle fries which were crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. Our waiter, which I'm sorry I can't remember his name, was excellent at describing each dish we questioned him on.  He made us want everything. FYI, the iced tea is freshly brewed and the give you an extra carafe for refills. Okay I'm hungry again. We're going to Le Peep for breakfast in the morning. Enjoy!</text>

<Text>Two words, C'est magnifique! The eggs were cooked to perfection, the pancake batter is light and fluffy served with warmed syrup, endless coffee, gourmet Lavazza coffee choices, and thats just breakfast. The service is friendly and efficient, the embiance of the restaurant makes you feel right at home. Le Peep is our new favorite and we will be back!</Text><GmapID>0x80dcef2e14f85d03:0x51c745defe50c238<//GmapID>< userid>

<response>None<//response><review>This place has gone downhill!  There's a sign indicating new owners.  Our family of four arrived at 11:30.  Place was half full, lot of empty tables.  Three families ahead of us waiting to be seated.  We waited twenty minutes to be seated.  We sat down and watched two families seated after us already receiving water and receiving their food.  By the time we received our food, we had been there for 45 minutes.  Food was cold.  Family seated next to us sent their bacon back, saying it was "inedible".  We were also there on Father's Day and the whole restaurant smelled like burned food, as was the case today.  I don't think I need to go back to Let Peep anyone.  It was great when it first opened.</review>< user>

<Rating>1< /Rating><text>We bought a local flavor coupon and decided to drive 12 miles to try this place that is under a new management. The food and service was good, but when I presented the coupon it was refused. the manager said that they did not know anything about the coupon and then a couple sentences later said that the coupon was not what they thought it was. He outright lied to me. The manager then asked for my sympathy by asking me to imagine how they felt. I exclaimed that this was not acceptable and I would not be coming back.  I paid full price for the meal, will never go back to this place, nor will I be using Local Flavor any longer......</text><response>{'time': 1567324636132, 'text': "Dear Jim Black, We're extremely sorry that you had to face such difficulties, problems in customer service are not something we are known for.

<Text>I had breakfast here last Saturday with the family and the place was packed and people waiting but Dean the owner was really accommodating and moved quick to get our table.  He really seems to care about every customer from what I saw that day. Nice to be appreciated if other places could do the same. AWSOME PLACE< /Text>< user_name>

Small cute restaurant.
Got the greek goddess, which is an egg white omlet, with spinach tomatoes, artachocke, feta and kalamata olives. Has a side of peasent potatoes and an english muffin.
Also got a side of pancakes.
First bite of the omlet was a bit jolting, the kalamata olive was strong. However the rest was very pleasant, good hearty taste and good mixture of ingredients. The potatoes where just a slight variation of country potatoes. They were not over cooked but had a good crunch to them. The pancakes were ok nothing special but also nothing bad. With a little syrup they tasted just like ones from a pancake breakfast.< /text>

Seemed good the first time we were here when they first opened. Not so much anymore. Service is not great and neither is the food. They have what seems to be a good espresso machine, but the coffee is just average, yet you're paying the same price as a coffee from Peet's coffee.  There is a guy who works here who seems to be the manager or the owner, I'm not sure, but he always looks angry and stressed out and is not very friendly.  I guess that attitude trickles down to the rest of the staff. We came 3 times and we won't be returning.<//review>

No one star.
1) we asked for a side in a little cup, called pico the galo, they charged $3 for it!!
2) My salad was the most expensive and very bad prepared.
My husband found a hair in his plate. We never go back again.< /Text>

First impression. Plane is clean. Sitting down for 30 minutes, food isn't here yet, 3 tables occupied, 5 waiters standing around, 2 are on their phones texting. One, what ot looks like manager, is meandering around the kitchen with his hands in his pockets.
Food just came. Looks good, tastes good. Friendly staff.</Text>

2.  Ordered food and it had been 45 mins from the time we sat down and still no food... went and asked to speak to manager. Was told he was busy but what could he (host) help with. I explained situation and he looked puzzled but apologized.
3.  Food finally arrived. Pancakes so cold that even butter didn't melt.
4.  Half way through my skillet dish I found a long black hair!!! OMG!!! And no I don’t have black hair. Asked AGAIN to speak to manager.
This time the GM came to our table. Nice guy, apologized and comp’d the meal but thats too many issues on my first visit so that will be my last. Not sure how long this place will last with this lack of service.</text></record>

< Review>
My wife and I used to come here a lot and we gave this place many chances and have spent a lot of money here. Viktor is the only good server there. Every other server including the manager gets our order wrong and we get bad service. Even though they will write down our order, each time when it comes out to us there is always something wrong. Really tired of going through the hassle and we will be going to a new spot to avoid any more problems. Today we finally told the manager that we will not be returning. If you like bad service, over priced food, and to repeat yourself.. then this is your spot.< /Review>

I have been a fan of LePeep for a couple of decades. This newly opened restaurant clearly has some things to work out. The Gooey Buns are desperate for cinnamon, my over easy eggs were way over cooked and the skillet breakfast was dry. The atmosphere needs some Devore to make it warming enough to overcome the deficiencies in the food.<//text>

I ordered an omelette for pick up  I got there in 15 minuets as I was told.  The gentleman was just bringing it out of the kitchen. The omelette was way overdone the potatoes were hard as a rock as if they were left from the day before. It was supposed to come with English Muffins. It did not. $16.33 for nothing. Had to trash it.< /Text>

Fast and efficient service. They were able to come even earlier than scheduled and had my truck at the shop before the scheduled appointment. Made a difficult situation hassle free. Would definitely recommend.</Review>

<Text>Thanks again Daniel for helping me with the flat tire on my truck. I've always changed tires on cars, so on a truck it was a new experience.

Daniel was kind, professional, and displayed an excellent spirit!

West Tow Inc is very fortunate to have a representative like Daniel!

Keep up the Great work!!
Thank you.<//Text>< Pictures>

Our truck broke down and our Geico roadside assistance actually sent West Tow but we were super impressed with the whole experience. They came within the estimated time frame, handled our truck with care, and got it dropped off at the dealership without any problems. The woman I spoke with on the phone was super friendly and understanding, even though I had to call her multiple times because our situation kept changing. We would definitely use again and recommend to anyone in the area.</Text>

Not sure it is legal but these guys got me first 680 dollars  on top of 75 at the sheriffs station, when the deputy "M" told me he won't be holding it so I can go get it out right away. Then I got the run around.. courteous however but seriously don't get impounded by them you get charged for even the weekend...<//review>

Excellent service!  Both the receptionist and the tow truck driver were very professional, efficient, and friendly.  After calling West Coast Tow I had someone show up within a half hour.  The tow truck operator was very experienced and went above board to make sure I was taken care of.   Next time you need help and want to avoid as much stress as possible I highly recommend this company.  Best tow company ever!<//review>

I got the truck stuck, I mean really stuck. Buried to the axels. I called West Tow and after a quick and courteous call with dispatch Brandon was at my location in 5min... Literally 5min. I couldn't believe it. Another 5 min and I was recovered from my muddy tomb and on my way. I can't thank West Tow enough for there punctuality, professionalism and courteous staff. They really made a frustrating situation completely disappear.< /text>

<text>Had a hole in my truck's tire. West Tow was dispatched through my Geico Roadside Assistance. They called when my provider was 20 min out. Mike was my service provider. Very personable, professional, and quick. Put my spare on in no time.

<review>They arrived way faster than the time expected. The technician was super helpful and worried about my safety walking with me through the front of the towing truck and into the passenger seat instead of me being oblivious and wanting to walk through the back of the towing truck. That act of care shows how much they care about the customer. He was also very friendly and asked if I was okay after the accident.<//review></record></dataset><record>

<review>Awesome service, made a bad situation tolerable by going above and beyond with their service. From the initial phone call, to let me know that the tow driver was on his way, to updating me of his ETA. Extremely professional and knowledgeable driver, absolutely took care of us and our car needs. The best part was when, all was done with the towing and delivering of my car; Danny the tow truck driver turned to me and said " may I help you with anything else?" That was absolutely incredible,  his job was completed and he still asked me if I needed anything else. Thank you for your professionalism and absolutely amazing customer service.  I absolutely recommend.<//review><gmap_id>0x80dc9d708e78f645:0xc0f49925c5d88f0c< /gmap_id></record>

<Review>I have never been treated so well by any towing company...for two days Branden came out to jump start our car. He was so kind and courteous. He was concerned yesterday when he was leaving that the car was started in our enclosed garage. He made a special call to the office to have them call us and make sure we were ok. We had slipped out ahead of him so he had no idea we were already on the road. From Geiko staff...who connected us to this great company...to dispatch team to Brandon. .we could have not ask for any better service...it was Superior in every sense of the word. God Bless you all your homes and families...You are amazing.< /Review>< Gmap_id>

after a stressful day and a few less than kind encounters, the tower was high energy, polite, and experienced. This was a very challenging tow but he did it and with a smile!<//Review>

The young man who "rescued" me last night was awesome. Not only did he arrive at the time he said he would. He helped me into his truck and turned the heat up, I was very cold. He expertly hoisted my car and towed us home. He was very helpful, friendly and gracious. Thank you for your help. Will recommend you to anyone I know.< /Review>

Our tow truck driver was awesome! He waited so patiently for our ride to pick us up & was extremely nice! It was a little chilly out & made sure we were warm especially my 1 year old. The two times I have used this company they arrived sooner then the estimated time given.< /text>

Total professionals!!!! The driver trusted my word that the dirt road I broke down on was safe and passable.  The other guys - who I’ve used for 20 years wouldn’t even try.
Got my fifty year old VW Bus out and home in MINUTES!!!! You guys at West will have my business and my recommendation from now on!!<//Review>

The person who answered the phone was really friendly. I thought I was going to have to wait an hour for my car to be towed, but she suggested I try having a jump start first so that I hopefully wouldn't be stranded that long. The man who jump started my cae was also very friendly and had me back on the road in minutes! Really appreciated the excellent service!< /Text>

West Tow is the best towing company I’ve had the pleasure working with. All the drivers are very professional and timely in their work also they always go above and beyond customer service wise and make sure you feel comfortable and confident that your vehicle is in good hands while they are getting your vehicle from point A to point B. Thank you Steve and the West Tow team for all your great work and amazing customer service!!!< /text>

<review>Loved Ronnie who took my service call on Easter Sunday - he was courteous and his truck was super clean. He has genuine passion for helping people and he has true integrity, plus represents great family values, showing what a good  young man looks like. He made me feel like all is going to.be ok even though I  was being towed on Easter
Sunday. Ronnie role models a man who is loving life and living well because of his ability to understand there's work that needs to be done to be that!!! Very motivating and inspiring!< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<rating>5</rating><text>For you all Tesla owner fyi not all towing company can tow Tesla, i strongly suggest to use west tow, I called AAA for towing my Tesla and 2 others company accepted but later call me back that they won’t able to tow Tesla, I told AAA to use west tow and AAA said that it’ll be 2 hrs wait :( I was disappointed but no choice so I said okay. Couple minutes later Steve the owner from west tow called me that he’ll have another driver to come and tow my car in 20 minutes. I’m so glad and thankful because I’ve couple appointments to get it done.
Highly recommended, great service from driver Adam that always smile and big shout out to Steve that save my day. Thank you west tow!!<//text>< Pics>

Driver was awesome. He got to me quickly. But more importantly, this driver was the kindest person I have met.  He made the situation easy to manage.  He put everything back where it belonged.  He asked me if there was anything else I needed and offered me some water.  Then he thanked me for my time.  Thank you.<//review>

<review>When West Tow arrived to tow my vehicle, the driver tried a few thing to get my car going, and was successful.
I was able to drive my car home, instead of having it towed to a shop.
The driver was very friendly and did a great job.
If I could give West Tow and the driver more than a five star rating I would.
West Tow and their driver deserves a 10× rating.<//review>< Name>

The most straight forward, honest, capable, helpful, informative, calming, and efficient experience I have ever had with ANY automotive related company. The technicians were a relief, understanding, and empathetic. I had previously had a bad experience with a different company saying that they could not change my tire and west tow did it in under 5 minutes and even inflated my spare. I would never want to use a different company again. Once more, the most capable and informative help I have ever received. Thank you West Tow.<//text>

<Review>I live locally near the Paloma Valley High School, and I am always dispatched this company from AAA. Last 2 times when my car broke down, they were swift and quick to get to me and I always see they use the necessary equipment and chains in specific areas to make sure all 4 wheels aren't going anywhere, which was great because I know of others from other areas that just throw your car up, put a chain and hope for the best driving down. I can tell they really care about their customers, they always ask me in the cab about the problem and possible troubleshooting tips to possibly save me a trip to the dealer.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><username>Nate TenPenny< /username>< user>

<Text>I was at an auto store with a flat tire 2 hours before closing and they refused to help me.  I called insurance and they sent Adam.  Adam advocated on my behalf and I was able to get a new tire and back on my way.  Without Adam and his help I would have been stranded.</Text>< Pics>

<Text>This is the second time I  have been in trouble and had to use the roadside assistance from West towing. The first time I ran out of gas. And today I locked myself out of the car. The company has great communication and the driver was very awesome. Also the second time I've had the driver provide roadside assistance. Thank you West towing for being of service to my neighborhood.< /Text>< userid>

Unfortunately, no place was open to get it fixed, so they offered to come back at 10 a.m. in the morning to have my car towed to a shop to have it fixed. Two different occasions... two different guys. Both were excellent, professional and super nice! Thank you West Tow. You guys are awesome! On 04/13/2018 and once again Zerek came out to help me when my car stopped. He was so professional, courteous and extremely helpful. He always give good service and he goes the extra mile. Thank you West Tow.< /Review>< pictures>

Basic breakdown: I got a flat but Only had the spare tire in the trunk with no Jack or star (reason being: my cars slammed so not many jacks fit underneath my car as it is)
AAA Sent WEST TOW INC. to help me out
They were very Fast, driver was honest & efficient. I really couldn't have asked for a smoother experience. The quality of work performed in a the very satisfying amount of time was UNMATCH.... Thanks Again,

In Carl I trust! My truck broke down on the freeway and I contacted geico who sent out west tow. Carl the driver was fast, prompt, and so friendly and resourceful. If I ever need anything towed again I'll be calling him directly. Thank you Carl!</text>

Top notch professionals from the dispatcher to the driver.  Our driver was able to get the vehicle from the bottom of a driveway and drop it off in a narrow driveway on a narrow street.</text>

Didnt take as long as I assumed it would have from the time I called AAA to when he actually showed up, and dispatch contacted shortly after I ended My call w/ AAA. Lamar was very professional and courteous and he went above and beyond his duties. Before he even got to Me he had contacted me himself to update me on how far or how much longer he was away. Thank You West Tow Inc for hiring top notch employees.</Review>< pics>

< Review>
Honestly BEST TOW COMPANY EVER!!! Words can’t even explain or express. I was recently in a car accident (got hit from behind) and the tow company sent a driver right away and was constantly connected with my car insurance to make sure there was no issues. The tow driver was AMAZING, so friendly and was very informative to any questions I had. He came on site right away. I was shaking after the accident and his personality and hospitality instantly calmed me down and made me feel safe. The insurance messed up on paperwork and it affected the drop off for this tow truck service, yet West Tow was still cooperative with me & helping my insurance get everything situated and waited till I was okay and everything was fixed. TOP OF THE LINE FRICKEN SERVICE WORDS CAN’T DESCRIBED!!<//Review>

Awesome experience! I requested a quote thru Yelp!. I called and accepted the quote and less than 30 minutes later Tony showed up, popped the door lock, jump started my Pilot and away I went. Tony was clean, professional and friendly. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this company. Thanks Steve and Tony!< /text>

<review>I got a flat tire just as I was exiting the freeway. It was night and rainy.  Having roadside assistance through my car insurance company, I called on them for help.  They told me that they had contacted a service and were told that it would be about an hour.  That service never contacted me.  After an hour and 15 minutes I called that service and was told that it would be at least 30 to 40 minutes more.  I called on my insurance company to intervene and they called West Tow.  Immediately I received a call from the West Tow dispatcher giving me an estimated arrival time (about 30 minutes), and then 10 minutes later a call from the driver saying that he was 15 minutes away.  A few minutes later the dispatcher called again to update me on the driver's GPS location, and then he was there!  The service was great and even performed with a smile on that cold rainy night.  I cannot say enough good things about West Tow.  Just a bit of friendly advice; save yourself the hassle and call West Tow first!</review><Rate>5< /Rate>< username>

These guys are great. So professional. They have towed our car a few times and I feel very comfortable with them at my house and in driving with them to the drop off location etc... They show up on time and handle business. They have changed my tire when I drove over a nail and it was totally deflated in my driveway-and again, arrived on time, treated me so professionally... I highly recommend them.<//text>

<Text>My sons go to school in California and I am always worried about what will happen if they break down.  I bought roadside assistance to make sure they would always be able to call for help.  Last week they were towed by West Tow.  The tow truck arrived quickly.  They helped my son decide the best place to tow his car and really helped him with the whole process.  I would totally recommend West Tow.< /Text><user_id>105238127760193878474</user_id><gmap_id>0x80dc9d708e78f645:0xc0f49925c5d88f0c< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>The best service I have ever received!!Called them after a horrible service from another local towing company (black towing) and they were quick and efficient! Driver Don (who was amazing and super friendly) got my husband off the Hwy and loaded and to my house in 20mins. ! I would recommend this company to everyone. I know I'll be going back if ever in need. Thank you for an outstanding service provided.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

These guys are awesome! Lamar went out of his way to Un load my truck  and re load in front of my buddies house because the tow yard would not allow him to put my truck on backwards for a easy Un load. Thanks guys, great people and service!!!<//text>

< Review>
I had a flat on the I-15.I had a toddler with me. Apparently, 20 min into AAA's dispatch to the first tow company that company decided to drop the job, which left me stranded.
Then WEST TOW was dispatched by AAA. They arrived within 20 min. They driver was very considerate of our situation. He got my grandson and me in the cab right away and went to work expeditiously.  He was pleasant during the ride and apologized for my long wait even though it was the fault of the first tow company.
He even parked my car in my garage. Thank you young man.<//Review>

The other night my wife's car was broken down on the side of the road, and John, one of the drivers with West Tow, cut his dinner short to promptly come to my call. He was very fast, clean, careful, respectful, and an all around great guy.
I don't have roadside assistance and when i called West Tow they gave me a fair price less than i expected to pay for how far i needed to tow, and when I mentioned being a veteran they knocked the price down even more. You cant get much better than that. I think these guys understand your in a shitty situation, your on the side of the road, you don't know how expensive the repair will be, and they don't try to drain your wallet dry, or leave you waiting for hours.
*Great guys
*Great prices
*Great service
!!!! Highly recommend !!!!< /text>

<review>I was connected with West Tow through my roadside assistance service on 1/18/14 when the car wouldn't start--battery trouble. The West Tow dispatcher I spoke with on the phone was courteous, and estimated that one of his guys could get to us in 30, 35 minutes. The man who came to help us--his name started with an R, Roy maybe?--called to let us know when he was close by. When he got to us (which was in very good time), he fixed the problem quickly, and gave lots of helpful advice. He was great at his job and very personable. While the battery issue was an inconvenience, it was a pleasure working with West Tow.<//review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Vincent showed up in 15 mins. He was fast, courteous, smelled nice and uniform was clean. Vincent also was helpful with his extended knowledge of cars. I learned some valuable information from him when I was told wrong by a Independent U-Haul place. Long story short, U-Haul just about cost me money I don't have. Thanks to Vincent, I now have more options on how to tow my van behind my Motorhome where my key won't get locked (freak mystery) into my van.< /Review>

<review>Terrific polite and friendly no bullsh!# all business, but at the same time keeping a very professional as well as wellrespectful attitude. A very nice change from what i have deen noticing when customer service in almost every business has been  extremely poor with lack of respect even common decency the bare nescessity of customer service has been deteriorating at an extremely rapid rate.< /review><rating>5< /rating><GmapID>0x80dc9d708e78f645:0xc0f49925c5d88f0c<//GmapID><userid>103601201667036432211< /userid>< Resp>
