<review>Fast and easy, I just sat in the car while they did it real quick, they finished in about 15 minutes. The only reason it wasn't a five-star was because it was a few bucks more than when I take it to the dealership.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<rate>5</rate><text>Outstanding service. From the minute you drive in, the technicians are at your service. They are friendly, professional, and thorough. I went to this Jiffy Lube to get my car a synthetic oil change. Air in tires was checked, windows were washed, all fluids were checked, the battery was checked. The battery charge was very low and I had been worried about it. This next week I will be back at Jiffy for new battery and to get the transmission fluid changed. This desert heat is so hard on engines. I am also getting new air filter and cabin filter installed. They offer so many products and services while you stay with your car the whole time. A coupon was applied to the cost of the oil change and I didn't have a coupon; they just applied it. This is the only place I will bring my car for all services they provide. I highly recommend this Jiffy Lube.<//text>< Pictures>

<Text>I actually visited another Jiffy Lube on Fred Waring, by walmart- I called, asked if they could do a tire rotation on my jeep- they said yes, that i didn't need an appointment- when I arrived, they told me their lift could not lift my Jeep - "but I just called you?! and you said you could do it?"  I drove to this Jiffy Lube and got the most friendly service ever, at 5:30 on a Saturday night- Best guys work in there, so kind to help me out- 5 stars!!!!< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>{'time': 1581372910245, 'text': 'Thank you so much for taking the time to leave this review, Leslie!

<Gmap_id>0x80daf95e7ffe9829:0x8dd64b42f7a864ea<//Gmap_id><Pics>None< /Pics><Review>I went in for a oil change and a  mechanic by the name of Tony recommended I get a transmission flush I agreed because they’ve always taken care of me  I asked if there’s service ACs here because I needed my AC serviced as well he said yes and then he took me inside the building  and showed me how much it would be for everything if I were to be charged by Jiffy Lube and the total came out to around $1200.  I told him no that it was too expensive and he seemed real pushy .  And just overall began being very unprofessional   he said he was “leveling” with me and  he would be able to do all the work that I wanted to do to through him personally for $600. Cash only. Of course I agreed because I figured he was helping me and was going to take care of me like they all do. The entire time I was Letting him know I don’t understand what’s happening and the main end result I wanted was for my AC to blow cold air he said yes It would blow cold air.  I left my car with him for 20 minutes I went to the bank and before I could return he called me from a personal phone number and told me my AC hose had a leak in it so he couldn’t maintenance my AC.  I thought that was fine I would take my oil change and transmission flush and be on my way. I return to the store and he has me follow him to the side of the building where I assume no one can see us and demands I pulled my wallet out and give him $400 cash.  At that point I didn’t know what to do I felt really uncomfortable and I just wanted to get my receipt and be on my way. He then took me inside the building and  change the number that we agreed on and said that we agreed on $500.  At this time I was really feeling intimidated and even more than uncomfortable I no longer felt  make a customer and started to feel like I was being told what to do he then rang me up for an oil change and I had to pay another hundred dollars for that so overall I gave TONY $600 cash.  Confused and completely flabbergasted I just collecting my things and left as fast as I could completely unaware of what  just really took place. I handed the receipt to my wife and drove off, she looked at the receipt and said I was only charge for an oil change so why did I give him all that money then. I told her I didn’t know and she said that’s not right.  I agreed and when I drove back to get a better understanding of what he did to my car, immediately he tried walking my off the property.  I tried asking him to explain what he did to my car he said he flushed my transmission changed my oil and my oil filter and he flush my radiator when I try to explain that he made me feel like I got burned and this didn’t feel right and I wanted my Money back. He laughed in my face and gave me $40 and told me no one is taking anything from him at that point I was so frightened I just went back to my car.   I didn’t know what to do or who to tell so I told my mom and she went down to the store and they told her that Tony doesn’t even work on cars at that establishment so you can imagine my level of frustration and discomfort. I could get things to add up in my head so I did a little  research and found out that a transmission flush and a radiator flush take anywhere from 3 to 4 hours to 2-6 hours. I left my car with that man for twenty five minutes to forty five minutes maximum. Jiffy lube I feel violated and taken advantage of. Im legit afraid to go back to your store, TONY took a picture of my information on his personal phone which was even more unsettling I’ve never been more forced or intimidated to make a purchase in my life. I want me money back, of course, although no amount of money will restore my trust in your business. I hope that management sees this and takes affirmative action because god forbid TONY has done this to another naive person. Over all I’m extremely upset and will be contacting the Corporate office and advising the health department about the lack of precaution that man took to prevent the spread of covid 19 in your establishment.</Review><user_id>102836300597304482244</user_id>< date>

Due to the Covid-19 precautionary measures it was a drive-thru oil change. Robbie was very professional and courteous with good advise regarding a few deficiencies of vehicle. The shop was very clean and both mechanics wore mask and practice distance while servicing the car.<//text>

Prices all over the board with them.... Buy any recommended replacement air filters cabin filters at the parts place... Change them yourself to save... . If you are handy!
Otherwise dobleu the price if they have them!

Always professional and work with their loyal customers. Very quick service also. Some have complained about the price which I think is crazy. Waiting 2 hours at the dealership to save $10 make any sense? Highly recommend the palm desert location.<//Review>

I have had oil changes here before and service was great
Today I stoped in just looking for some help. I am using a lender car while my car is in for tune up etc. well the loner is leaking fluid and I was concerned and wasn’t sure what was leaking they checked for me and were very kind to a very senior lady who knows very little about these things. I will always go there for oil changes and recommend them to others.
I stoped elsewhere and was treated very badly</Text>

Terrible service they did nothing to our car just kept us waiting, then tried to say that they had topped us off and checked our tire pressure. However they somehow did not have a record of our car even being there.  When my fiancee  called to speak to a manager Eduardo was rude to us. Never again going here.< /review>

<Text>Generous and helpful staff! The management was professional, friendly, and so helpful.
I stopped by to buy some shampoo for my mom and the staff introduced me to so many different options, going above and beyond. The customer service was superb and excellent. Thank you so much for being so helpful and making my day!
See you again!!!<//Text>< Pictures>

Came from LA, my friend recommended me to visit saying they have EVERYTHING you need. Oh boy, she was correct! The store is very well maintained and their staff is very friendly! The customer service I received was very different from LA and I received the best customer service of my life. They have a variety of products and brands to choose from. Next time I come back to SF, I will definitely be coming back to make another success & satisfying purchase!< /review>

I've been going to this location for a few years.
Being disabled I have difficulty finding  parking  due to the restricted  parking in this area .  it's a challenge for me to patronize the store.   however they have great customer servers with a  wide variety of supplies...< /Review>

Very small & cluttering & if you use your debit card their is a 10$ minimum no exceptions, their willing to lose a sell instead of just charging a additional 35-50 cent for debit/credit card use. Has a black woman as an employee but accuses women of color stealing< /Review>

They have great prices and a large selection of human, Remy, virgin, and synthetic hair and wigs. Good quality make up and other beauty supplies at affordable prices. This is my go to hair and accessory shop. I frequent 4-7 times a month.</Review><user_id>112416911289764725013< /user_id><name>Lina Rosales< /name><Time>1550043271147</Time></record>

<name>Kori B.<//name><Review>Traveled 1 hour to come pick up some hair. As I have done several times before to this location. Only to be accused of trying to steal eyelashes. When I very clearly put the eyelashes down a the counter...stepped away and took my phone out of my bag to take a photo of a hair color i liked. The owner walks around the corner and accuses me of trying to take the lashes. I walked out no need to argue or yell. My money can and will stay right in my pocket.  I've spend hundreds of dollars at this location in the past. No more. I will no longer support a place that harasses the people who keep their store open.<//Review><response>None<//response><Pictures>None</Pictures>< date>

I went to TGIF Beauty Supply to get some hair supplies for my little one. It was great. I never used a beader before l really didnt know what l was looking for. I asked one of the employees they knew what l was asking for lead me wear to get it in the store. This store has some of everything for everybody. I saw one employee installing a wig for a customer. I bought beads a beader and ruber bands the total came to $9.97 not bad the beader came with instructions. This store is located on San Bruno Ave. & Bacon.< /Review>

< Review>
The ladies who help you pick out your hair are great. Its the owners pretending to care about those who shop there. Their crooked smiles and rude behaivior is as bad as the quality of their wigs.< /Review>

This salon seems to specialize in hair,i went looking for nail supplies and was disappointed the selection is small and the brands are overpriced,still affordable but other places sell for half the price,also asked for cash only.<//text>

Very good place to grab lunch! Their BBQ pork sandwich was literally to die for! Loved it! Place is really nice and clean. The people here are very nice and treat you very well. Donuts look good but the sandwich selection is huge! And if I'm going off of the BBQ pork one they are all good!< /review>

< review>
Always super nice people and great service and prices. I’ve been coming here since i moved to Norco when I was little and it’s always been great. They always ask how my family is doing and my little brothers and they’re always super sweet. My friend and I walk over sometimes for donuts too and enjoy the smoothies.
PS - the apple fritter is amazing</review>

It's because of wonderful people like her, that have made my husbands deployment so much easier for my daughter. We will miss it when we have to move!<//Review>< pictures>

<Review>Looove this little place! I stop here often for breakfast and coffee before I go to work at Zen Acupuncture. The owners are a great friendly couple who are just sweet!
This is my stop, quick, delicious and reasonable on the prices!
So grateful for them!

<Text>I've read positive and negative reviews for Norco Donut. I completely agree with the positive ones and completely disagree with the negative ones. If I have one complaint at all, its that they sell out of my favorite donuts often before I can get there. Not their fault of course, their donuts are way better than anyone else's!

The two women who operate the shop have always been incredibly friendly and shown exemplary customer service. I have placed orders that have come back incorrect - and they have made the whole order over again from scratch WITHOUT me paying for it again. They have taken the time to get to know my family, and even know what we like.

To the food quality, I can only speak to the donuts and sandwiches. I have found both to be fresh and delicious every time. The donuts are always made from scratch daily. Down the street a half-mile or so is a Yum Yum Donuts store. We have purchased from both stores and we now consider Norco Donut our donut store. Yum Yum doesn't even compare - their donuts are stale and tasteless!

Norco Donut has been around for a few years. Anything they screwed up at the beginning is well fixed now. They do a great job and I hope they stay in business for many years to come.</Text><Response>None</Response>< date>

<Text>They have some decent stuff, but if you are unsatisfied with something,  don't expect them to be nice or do anything about it. I was highly dissatisfied with a $3.50 smoothie & asked to have it exchanged with a different flavor & the lady told me I would have pay for it again! I told her that's terrible customer service. I won't be going there again.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None</response><gmapID>0x80dcc9dcf3e36e21:0xc29d24dff3828d91< /gmapID></record>

Before loading, I asked what kind of cargo it was. I asked to stop the loading, but he still finished loading. When I asked to unload it, no one paid any attention. I called the police.  Someone came out to unload the goods later, and the staff and security had a bad attitude, making it difficult for me to scold me many times.</review>< pics>

Very slow, checked in 20 minutes before appointment,  almost an hour later still didn't have a door. Takes average of 50 minutes just for the check-in process. Come prepared, you will be here for a while. I took my 10 here, lemon =>lemonades.< /Review>

If there is one thing St george mastered it’s definitely giving the worst service ever. Please do not waste your money with them. Milad Ghlamnejad is the supervisor, I guess? And dealing with him made me realize why his team is such a failure. They act like they monopolized the market and they’ll take your money like no other company.<//Text>

< Review>
Terrible customer service. I was trying to find a place to get my nails done for my bday. I will not however spend my money where there is no respect for the customer. I walked in & immediately was turned off by the interior & lack of nail polish colors & the terrible customer service. I don't mind you being busy, considering only two old nail techs were working, but there is a way to talk to people. I decided to check them out going against others negative take but now I see why.</Review>

<Review>I don’t particularly enjoy leaving negative reviews but I just have to with this one. Came here late on a Saturday because my normal place was closed already but I was just desperate to get my gel polish removed, and I just wanted my nails shaped and clear pink polished. When I left my nails were completely uneven and the edges were jagged as hell, the polish was painted on super thick and carelessly, it left bubbles in the polish and there were even strands of lint dried into my nails. The previous polish was also not fully removed. I mean, it was so bad I was laughing after looking at my nails more closely. And to top it all off a few days later I found one of my cuticles became infected. So I can’t say I recommend this place. At least not an hour before closing on a Saturday.< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNR0t1pQ-fUoxHs1r3292qp_pcKzXncr0KyDRO7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOcW5Oumythag7wuHwsjhjNnNXAJKeb6jUL5fq9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMKFUQRxC3YLjq1wBtg0OIAscR7MwxB_ZTL7fQF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOAu_iEU2bLN4OCM92Vor0Ah8KlB_j54DV_4L9E=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< Resp>

About 4 people sitting around doing nothing and the woman there told me to come back tomorrow to take my acrylics off. Not to redo my nails, paint them, nothing. Couldn't even take the nails off. Never coming back.</Review>

<Rate>3</Rate><review>Where the heck did Lisa go!???  Besides Linda, she was the best nail tech in the shop. Never had my nails done by Mark, but I've seen his work and he's okay, but Lisa was better. I like this spot because there is ample parking and VERY reasonable pricing, but they do need to remodel and get rid of the roaches and the carpet!!!

<review>It's just ok because i got gel manicure and the gel was coming off the next day. Went back to have them do it over and they had me sitting too long. I was told to come back when i came back tue lady was on another client. I feel that i should have been accommodated instead of giving me the run around. I won't ever go back.👎👎👎 I work hard for my 💰 and even give tips.</review>< Resp>

I come in mid afternoon to get a fill, I was not given a wait time but I sat anyway..never doing that again. After about 20 minutes,  the man asked if I can come back an hour and a half later.. um wth sir why not give me the wait time when I get there and not when you realize you need to call clients that aren't in yet. If you have appointments lined up DON'T take a walk in without letting them know the time nor let them sit there for minutes!  Worst management ever.< /Review>

<Text>The employees can be rude! They like to rush you out once you pay them for there services, some of them don't know how to paint your nails too good!... It's depending on who you get.... Most of their nail polish is old, and they have roaches!!! You may see one crawling on the floor or wall and they don't do anything about it! They act like the roaches are their friends... And if you make an employee mad! They talk about you in there native language it's only obvious....</Text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>This place is very dirty 🕷🐜🕸and worker's are terrible and they can't speak English and they don't understand what do you want and you have to tell them couple time's until they know what they have to do😔. The price is different from what you see it on the outside on the window 🤑like for example full set is 12$ but when you go inside and they finish the job they say 17$🤔 and you try to understand them why you charging more but they don't understand and you just put the money and trying to get out from the shop🏃 and not get headache 😡🤕<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x80c2c323241468bf:0x510f89dadbf11d8e<//GmapID></record>

I wish Mark would remodel the store with some new carpet and get rid of the roaches. He's been there for years now reason for his place of business to look so crummy. He most definitely have the money<//review>

<review>Been taking the Metrolink for a few years now. Never a doll moment as you get to travel around Southern California. Discover new places and meet all different types of people (all walks of life) as you explore new places well travel on the MetroLink as I have gotten to experience this with my boyfriend and on own my own. As I love taking pictures will inside the MetroLink. It doesn't matter where I'm at or where I'm traveling to there's always somewhere new to go too or want to travel too. Great experience are those you stop and see first hand in person. Learn to live in the moment, be present and enjoy life. Wednesday Travels from San Bernardino Depot January 06,2019 will visiting family friends for a few days in around Southern California<//review>< Pictures>

< review>
The trains are always late arriving to their destinations for one reason or another (they always have an excuse) so good luck ever making an appointment.  Their ticket machines are a joke - out dated and never working. And when one train is delayed the whole system gets messed up and they don't care - they have absolutely no back up plans, buses, or trains - you're just screwed. I can't believe how much money they take from customers for horrible service. The only reason why I'm giving an extra star is because the trains are nice and reasonably clean.<//review>

I use to work in Santa Ana. I took two trains and two buses to work daily. The metro out of Baldwin Park to Union Station. And then the metro out of Union Station to the Santa Ana Train Depot. I didn't have to drive. The scenery was amazing. I took lots of pictures on my travels. Just look at my Facebook. The seating is so comfortable and the train is to peaceful. I even fell asleep a few times and missed my stop. But then I became good friends with a few of the conductor's, and if they saw me asleep, they would wake me up at my stop. Great Great People who work for the Metro. I miss traveling on the Metro. I truly do.< /Text>

<Review>It's a fairly clean station that is laid out well. It's an old structure that  clearly shows it age for better or worse. I  think every Angeleno should come through at least once. Wide spaces with interesting views for photographers.< /Review>< rate>

Trains are pretty clean and reasonable for working in with a laptop, except for the few that are packed.  Most of the tracks are shared with freight trains, so there are occasional delays and cancelled trains.  Metrolink does a good job on safety since a driver crashed a train a decade ago.

Ticket Prices are way out of control.  The saving calculations Metrolink provides only make sense if your vehicle gets poor mileage, you pay through the nose for your vehicle maintainance, and you have to pay for parking at your destination.  If you buy a monthly pass and ride the train everyday, then the cost gets a little more reasonable.  (Yet who really rides it every day?)  Metrolink use to have a 10 pass deal, which made sense.  Wish they would bring that back.</review>

<date>1456435379799<//date><Text>You get what you pay for. If you are looking for a relatively cheap transportation for far places, the metrolink is perfect for you. It's run-down stations and trains are reliable on leaving the stations on time, but will take much longer to arrive than expected. Also don't skimp out on buying your tickets. security will eventually catch you.<//Text><user_name>Kimberly Ha< /user_name>< resp>

<Text>We went to a Dodger baseball game and at Union Station they have $6, which I will use for all my downtown parking needs in the future. Then they have free express bus service to Dodger Stadium and back.

WOW. A win no matter how you look at it. $6 Parking instead of $15. Don't have to fight the traffic getting to the stadium, the bus has a special lane and bypassed the lines and dropped us off right at the main gate.

We figured it would be hell getting out, but after the game there were 4 buses lined up, we walked on the first in the row with no line whatsoever and within a minute we were on our way. 10 minutes and we were back at Union Station.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<text>This is at LA Union Station. It's a fairly old train station but it's in the heart of downtown LA and it's a hub for Metrolink, Amtrak, the Metro Redline, the Metro Goldline and several buses.< /text>< pictures>

If your not in a rush to get to your destination then the metrolink is good to use. On the San Bernardino line you sometimes have to wait for other trains to pass. Other than that it's a comfortable ride.<//Text>

Plan your trip.  Start at the closest station.  Where is that?  Must I walk five miles to get there?  No thanks.  I think you are in a conspiracy with the taxi driver's union.< /review>

<Rate>3<//Rate><Text>This is the intermediate range component of So Cal Transit.  Shorter is LA Metro Light rail and buses.  Longer is Amtrak, especially the the Surfliner.  The biggest problem is the fractous transit agencies who make taking a trip difficult and each with its own fare structure and politics.Transfers between agencies is dificult and complicated.  Most agencies have good service.  The other problem is grade crossings.  Grade crossing slow trains and cause street congestion.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80c2c7b114e91835:0x8418bdae8dd1afe4< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Effective 10/5/15 Metrolink reduced service on the San Bernardino - Los Angeles line and materially changed the train schedule. Both yesterday and today trains were packed during normal commute times and trains ran behind schedule as a result of the additional time needed by passengers to exit and board cars that were packed to capacity with riders crowded together in the aisles. Those type of delays compound as each stop adds to the accumulated delays. This morning, the train that was supposed to arrive in Covina at 6:53 AM was about 15 minutes late as a result of the in-station delays that occurred during the trip from San Bernardino.

What's sadly laughable is that Metrolink preceded this change with an announcement of "Enhanced" service. The changes were hardly an enhancement and calling them such is rather insulting. I suppose the marketing department couldn't bring themselves to issue a release with the headline "Metrolink to boost profits by reducing service, combined with proposed fare increases."<//Text>

Trains are running late too often. Especially when it is an hour late. Metrolink should have consideration for passengers and have a replacement train when they run this late and it's due to technical problems. Using the same train to to continue on other trips puts all passengers at an even higher risk of further delays. Missing vital connections and or appointment it's very frustrating!!!!
Again, on the antelope valley line sitting in between two stations, for about 15 minutes now. Conductors says we're going to be late. So now my entire trip is ruined. I will not connect to other buses as planned,  unreliable metrolink services is becoming the normal.<//Review>

<Review>Gets worse and worse everyday. Everyday the trains are late and now with this ridiculous update, the trains are even later than before. Constant cancellations due to signal issues, mechanical issues, rain (yes rain) etc. Forget being alerted either on their site or app. The alerts dont show until AFTER the issue has come and gone.
Going to start driving again because why take a train that stops constantly and travels at about 20mph the entire trip? I can sit in traffic and do 20mph.
Just takes way to long when I can drive to my destination faster..kinda defeats the whole purpose of taking the train.

It is more expensive than Metro but the trains are nicer and quite. Plus Metrolink pass can be used on Metro trains.< /text>

At Wild Birds Unlimited, their return policy is on a store by store basis.  This store DOES NOT provide refunds for any reason.  Purchased items less than a week ago, was NOT able to use them and had full receipts and products in original condition…never used. Was only able to obtain store credit.  Have previously spent hundreds of dollars at this location…will absolutely be taking my business elsewhere.  Stay clear !<//Text>

This is such a delightful store! It has everything you need to decorate your backyard for feeding birds & critters. Such pretty feeders that I had to get multiples. There are many beautiful & whimsical birdbaths; I must buy one soon. The owners & staff are always very friendly & knowledgeable. They are enthusiastic to help find the right feeders & accessories for your needs. I highly recommend to join their club. I think it's $25 for a year. It gives great discounts on your purchases and you can receive $10 in birdbucks to spend in the store. Every month I spend at least $150, and I get $10 in birdbucks which I used the following month. Sure you can buy cheaper bags of birdseed from big chain discount stores, but those bags are full of extra fillers that aren't eaten. For quality mixes of birdseed that doesn't go to waste and for excellent customer service, Wild Birds Unlimited is the best choice. It is a local small business that deserves our support.< /Text>

I love feeding and watching wild birds, and this is my go-to place to get the supplies. They have all kinds of bird food from suet mixtures to a variety of seed and even live mealworms. They also have a wide assortment of feeders, birdbaths, and other fun bird paraphernalia.</text>

<Text>Exceptional store. I seem to go in and can find anything about birds. Even from my own family I ask for gift cards from here, because Wild Birds Unlimited has such a knowledge and supplies for all feathered (and a few others) friends. They offer classes and books and supplies any one needs!< /Text>< userid>

I like to feed the birds which include hummingbirds. I also raised Monarch and swallowtail butterflies. This store offers all kinds of classes on butterflies, Birds, including hawks. They offer a variety of classes. I just attended one owls and bats. They are having a show this Saturday Nov. 10  11am.. and repeats @12pm featuring live birds of prey.</Text>

I never realized how satisfying it is to cultivate a relationship with the birds in my own back yard until I stepped into this store! Not a single live bird in the store. Just well trained staff with a passion for helping people and well thought out products at reasonable prices. They can help you setup a single feeder to bring in a few hummingbirds or other wild birds or set you up with a whole system to bring birds by the flock to visit your yard. I highly recommend this store :-)< /review>

Bias Human Resources, they will fire you without proper investigation. HR don't care if you're being framed. Integrity won't save you from this company, you're just a number. Corrupt people works at this company.<//review>

When I started working here I thought I was with a good company. How ever they were only giveing me 16 hours a week. When asked if I could transfer to harbor UCLA hospital they made it so hard to get in that I was two months behind on my car note . When I would call Sylvia for work she would never answer the phone and I mean never. So now I'm at the point of hiding my car from the repo man and I'm still waiting on a call from Sylvia. It's a damn shame I hate this company<//Text>

<review>Been in the Security Industry for 13 years, I've played ball with contract and inhouse security by far the best company I've ever worked for. Hard work, dedication, and thinking outside the box in conjunction with supporting your branch will take you far. 4 promotions in 1 year 9 months is the proof in the pudding. GO DTLA< /review>< pics>

They never listen to the officers when they are in need or have complaints. The human resource team all sucks they only move when the company at risk. The branch managers sucks because they over look the people who work for the company for 10+ years. If you are Hispanic you may have a chance to grow with Securitas. Everyone else good luck this company it isn't professional at all. They get paid to sit around doing nothing but talk about how much money they make off our backs or when the next Avon catalog comes out. Oh did I mention the field supervisors all liars? Well they are also the branch managers too.</Review><username>King C< /username><gmapID>0x80c2c7b02249f30f:0xc8c77cd9e58b88b3< /gmapID>< Pics>

Very bad communication skills. I missed their call because I was busy, and when I called back I was never able to get a hold of the HR people. I called many times and left messages, but I guess they got mad because you need to answer them the first time or else they won’t give you a chance. That’s very unprofessional. And by reading the reviews, they actually did me a favor.< /Text>

< Review>
I wouldn't advise anyone to get employed at this company... I was hired on 4/6/15 my experience with this company was good the first month of working with this company... A few months passed by in I started to notice  they slack in communication with there employees, they are very rude to there employees , they don't train there employees properly then they get mad at you because u didn't complete your task.. My last post with this company was at hotel position my supervisor at the time went to canada the first week I started he did not train me properly on my patrols, on how he wants me to write my Daily activity report.... If you are a license security guard I advise you to find a better company to get employed with because they don't care about there employees at all</Review>

< review>
On March 28, at approximately 12:28 pm I had a HORRIBLE & experience with one of their black female employees who was very unprofessional that was standing guard at the Department of Social Services office. (I believe her badge name was Kelly) As I went through the metal dector,  one of the officers went through my bag and indicated I couldn't bring in my perfume bottle because it was glass. While I was asking him what did he recommend I do to keep it, the Kelly rudely interrupted our conversation & suggested that I needed to take my perfume bottle & put in the bushes. She was so rude, I let her know that I did not appreciate her interrupting & I did not ask for her input. She replied, "Well I gave it to you anyway and like I said, you cant have that glass bottle in here." I never insisted on bringing it in the building, I was simply asking the gentleman who searched my bag what he suggested I do seeing that I took the train & did not have my car to put my belongings back into.

She was very loud, rude, disruptive, causing attention to her and myself in the lobby.  When I asked for her supervisor information she snatched her badge off & shoved it at me in a very condescending manner. Not only that, but she made sure that she let  me know that she "had a job"...and to say this in a lobby full of people who are there to get assistance was highly inappropriate and distressing. Many of the people in the lobby rose up and began to speak out to my defense for her biased comments. Several women approached me and let me know they were offended by her comments and one other said that she had experienced Kelly being disrespectful toward her as well.

If you are poising yourself as a professional security company, tolerating employees that feel so confident to act with bias toward others and behave in such a discourteous, disrespectful manner to patrons in a place of business is a very poor reflection on your company. I will be notifying her direct supervisor at Securitas, the Deputy Supervisor as well as the officials responsible for contracting Securitas at the Dept of Social Services to let them know about the events that took place. This should not have happened.</review>

<Review>I worked for Securitas for 4 years. Never complain about one thing and theres was over 100 things I could of said . I opened my mouth up to complain I was uncomfortable with the PC actions towards everyone he worked with ( me, coworkers and contractors ) by yelling, swearing and catching them in lies that I proved with CCTV. HR told me to ignored them and let them treat me that way. So I was sent to another post down the street were the PC still reported false reports about me till they fired me for being late one day out of the week. after 3 years working at one post I missed the least amount of days then any one there. Why was I fired?? Because they don't care about you, your only a number to them. When you go for a interview just look around and see how unprofessional  their are.< /Review></record>

Worst company to work for and hire for guard services.  They lack of professionalism and quality all around, is beyond belief.  This company is not worth working for or hiring.<//Review>

<time>1508828633282< /time><rating>3<//rating><text>There's something weird about the dark grapes. They taste inside like sewer water smells. The green ones are crunchy and watery and delicious. The red ones are crunchy and sweet and flavorful. But these dark red smaller ones I hesitate to eat because they taste like they've been watered with sewer water. I thought I found the Holy grail of grapes, until one of those reds did not taste agreeable. I immediately looked up the farm on satellite to see if it was near a water sanitation plant or something. Something is definitely not right about the flavor.<//text>< pictures>

my son 15 month old got sick from grapes that you placed in Walmart store and I had to take him to the children's emergency (medical bills were provided as well as a claim) back in June never herd back as far as the claim I called a dozen times for your company to send me a 100.00 gift card my son medical bill is 150.00 after my insurance I was told I should be happy with that. I will like to know why was I only sent 100 that doesn't help me as a mother nor does it show that you all care about your customers</text>

I recently purchased Pristine Blanc grapes at a store near my home in Florida.  I do not like grapes at all BUT after trying these; I have to say I am hooked!  I have never tasted a seedless grape so sweet, so juicy, so firm and just so perfect.  Going back to get some more.  Keep them coming and thank you!<//review>

I wish I had bought 10 packages of your green table grapes.  These are the best grapes I've EVER had. I will buy more as soon as I can. Bought at Walmart in Presque Isle, Aroostook County, Maine.</text>

I am 81 years old so I have tasted a lot of grapes in my time. I am on my 8th  bag of your Pristine grapes. These grapes have been the delight, which at my age don't have many lol. They are the most consistantly sweet grape I have ever eaten.  a detriment to my borderline diabetes since i am limited on how many I can eat at one time.. Many thanks for the wonderful flavor and enjoyable eating.</text>

The ethics of their workplace is terrible I ended up working in their cold storage for a month and the lead of this place has no respect towards the workers instead of speaking to them as hardworking beings she tends to yell. She states we should come together and unite but every time there's an issue she yells to get her message through she wouldn't be in the position she is if it wasn't for the people. It's a Disgrace and it's heartbreaking that no one ever speaks out.< /Text>

So...after going to several other dealerships getting the run-around or the need-a-co-signer shuffle, my daughter recommended Car Credit. Everything was emailed over that morning, I ubered after work and drove home with a really cute car and a low car note. CLAUDIA WAS THE BEST. She didn't over sale a car with a too high note. She encouraged me to test drive other cars as to not rush into a decision. It was quick and painless. It was EXACTLY What I needed it. Thanks Claudia...<//text>

<text>Claudia was very excellent and very helpful. We were a bit short on cash and she still managed to get us off the lot with a new family car and with amazing deals. I can’t thank her enough for all the help honestly. I definitely recommend anyone looking to get a new car but can’t because of their credit check her out. She speaks both Spanish and English<//text><UserId.>103857622720354579419< /UserId.><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

I was searching and went to different places and they gave me a run around and I don’t have the best credit and didn’t want to have a co signer and came across this dealership and spoke to Claudia. She is absolutely adorable and very welcoming, actually the whole staff was awesome. She helped me get a car and believed in me when I was almost ready to give up on myself and searching for a vehicle. They have good cars and help you and explain everything to you. Thank you Claudia for your help.< /Review>

I picked up a honda from them before so I decided to play it safe and go somewhere I can trust. I co-signed for her and she purchased a 2010 Toyota Camry LE and she loves it! Big thanks to Louis for working hard to get us a low rate and low payment!

Picked up a 08 honda civic from Car Credit AutoGroup for $500 down and bad credit. Never had a problem with the car at all. The icing on the cake was the $100 gas card they gave me for mentioning the ad on Craigslist.</review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMynW313WVE0pBXNHuIy6TUMmjOedRhetfSPnN0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< Resp>

Quick and painless. Got approved right away with a repo on my credit and a low score. Dealership is always willing to working with you in payments, easy and affordable payments as well. Shout out to Mark my sales rep who help me get my 2012 Hyundai Accent.<//Text>

I have bought 2 cars from this place. with that said. people are super friendly, This new  guy Abraham is very personable and doesn't sit back and ignore you like other dealers do. he gets involved and wants to help you out. cars are good and clean and prices are reasonable and not too high.  over all its the best used car dealer and I will  give Abraham 10 stars if I could.</Review>

Abraham restored my faith that there are good people still in business. He helped me and my wife with my truck purchase hassle free. My wife suffer from diabetes so Abraham took his time  to walk my wife around the dealer so her legs wouldn't  cramps.Thank you Abraham ,because of your listening ear and desire to give good customer service. God Bless you!</Review>

I highly recommend and respect these two guys running this small business!!!. Abraham and Moe. Abraham got me down all the way from Seattle and I was very skeptical at first but after couple of days of texting and chatting he totally convinced me. It was the right decision. Very honest and fair to work with!!! If you want to find a great deal Abraham is the real deal.< /text>

Aric was an amazing representative. He made sure business was taken care of, I didn't worry and I got the deal I was able to afford. Not just him everyone there was polite and courteous. If you are looking for a great deal with a nice car and messed up credit and a terrible trade in this is the place to go! They will take care of you.</Text>

<Name>charron benjamin</Name><Rating>1<//Rating><Review>Do not! I repeat DO NOT buy a car from this place!!! They all pretend to be nice and helpful but all of the card they sell are pieces of crap! I bought a car a few weeks ago and it already smells like something is burning in the engine,  the engine light is on,  it heels every time i come to a stop (so every light and stop sign)  I was told to bring it in last week and they would "take care of me". I waited 6 hours for my car to be diagnosed and fixed and finally it was supposed to be.  They then asked me to pay in which I did not because take care means take care so I left after they finally agreed to not charge me for "fixing" the car. I drive the car and right away the same problems persist.  They never fixed anything!
I truly believe that they knew what was wrong with this car before they sold it to me because they forced this car on me.  The car is beautiful from the outside but a piece of junk. My manager referred me to them and her car has problems as well.  Do not waste your time or money with this place of business. You will be highly dissatisfied!!!!< /Review>< response>

SUPER FAST, SUPER STRAIGHTFORWARD, SUPER FRIENDLY! I found out about this place from a flyer that my friend sent me. I have been in the market for about a week. I had been let down from the major dealers due to a few bad credit situations and started to feel extremely discouraged. I called this place yesterday and was told that I had been approved over the phone. I came in the next morning and within an hour, I was signing my purchase papers. MR VITO IS AMAZING !! All the staff are very friendly including Ms Ruby and Mr Aric! I recommend this place to anyone.< /Text>

I messed up my credit long before I ever knew I’d need it for everything! Car Credit Auto Group gave me a second chance, and made financing a car a quick and simple process. Christopher did a great job</text>

<Text>The best all around experience!!!

Now I've been too many car dealership some big and some small. If you're like me the salesman can be a very pushy and  very demanding .  Here A Car Credit Auto Group there's a gentleman by the name of Glenn that i would definitely recommend to anyone. He
Made my boyfriend an I very comfortable . The moment we pulled into the lot he was standing there waiting for us. He answered every question that we had. I never once felt pressured to buy anything.  Glenn has opened  my eyes to see that not all salesman are liars. Thank you so much Glenn my family and I love our new car..< /Text>< Response>

I came to get a car & got exactly that. Rachelle is awesome! She was awesome, did everything in her power to get me & keep me in my car. I got a 2016 Hyundai Elantra with low miles, Rachelle helped me qualify to get the car I wanted & needed. Thanks again!<//review>

I got a car from here 9/24 Tuesday. By Friday 9/27 they asked me to return the car because my income wasn’t  legit. So to return the car. I asked them hey what about my deposit ? The boss(Jessica) says to me that I’m not getting my deposit because I lied to them about my income.. After reviewing my papers and my rights. their policy states “If the finance doesn’t Fall through within 10 days, they have to refund me al my money and or trade in. What I don’t understand is how do they have the rights to keep my deposits ?? Top it off they towed the car from me and no deposit... this company was 5 stars to me until they pulled that bs.. The man was so rude to me talking to me crazy like I didn’t even know men spoke to woman they way he did.. I would never get a car or tell people to go get a car from them.. I would read al their contracts first</Review>

<review>Went in today and got the most warm welcoming ever! These guys are the real deal and  MOST DEF what they talk about. After having 2 repos on my credit these guy helped me get into a car with low down payment and time to pay the down payment. Vito and Maurico are great at what they do, very friendly and funny..... I couldn't have asked for a better experience, great job guys and I am loving my 2013 Ford. God Bless you all!<//review>< Pics>

From the very first phone call I was treated with kindness and respect! They all went out of their way to help me get into a great car despite my credit situation. They treated me and my son like family. I cannot say enough on how Car Credit Auto Group have truly changed my life by helping me to get into a reliable vehicle. I recommend Car Credit Auto Group to everyone I know.  They make the impossible... Possible!
Thank you: Jason, Moe, Manny, Hawthorn and all the staff!< /Review>

I had gone to two different places looking to get a car in hopes to get a car and i got a no or i needed a co signer or down payment was way too high. I ended up going on Google search and came across this page saw the ratings it had and how many good reviews it had as well so decided to give it a try. Claudia was such a help to me from our conversation on the phone to me getting to their autogroup and she made it possible for me to walk out with a car. She was very kind and very professional and i noticed her great work when shed be assisting me but more of her buyers would come in or would phone for her. I recommend this place for anyone whos been turned down else to give this place a try or a call and ask for Claudia.
Thank you so much again Claudia i appreciate it

I was very wary about coming here because of the negative yelps reviews! But as someone who struggles from bad credit I decided to try it out for myself! I’m glad I did!!! I called and spoke to Eric to see if they can even help me. He got my info down then said he would call me back. Not too long later he called me and said they could help me out! The process was super easy!! They were able to get me into a Kia Optima for a very good price! Thank you again car credit auto group!!!<//review>

I honestly didn’t think I was going to ever get a car with a repo and a low credit score. Chris the car salesman really helped me out and was able to get me into a very nice car with low mileage. They dnt just rush through all the papers just to make a sale they really treat you with respect I would highly recommend getting your car from them< /Text>

This was my second time buying a car from a dealership and I have to admit I was definitely skeptical about it since the last used lot I dealt with were not the best of people let’s put it that way.  But honestly after I showed up an talked to Vito I actually started to feel better about the whole deal.  Vito, Rachelle, Eric (spelled however with a A) along with the owener were really awesome to deal with and actually did work with what I had. I’ve already recommend car credit to 2 other people an will definitely continue to do so.... also just a side note Vito and Rachelle are absolute comedy watching them work together. They both actually had me laughing a good amount of the time.  I’ll most definitely be going back to get another car from them  once I pay this one off.

And again thank you to everyone there for helping me out so much. I appreciate you guys<//Text>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>I was very happy with this dealership! My husband and I have bad credit and needed a second car due to his new job.  I started emailing and texting Glenn, he was quick to get back to me to let me know they can work with our budget and got us approved. I know he worked hard to figure it out with our score. When I was finally able to go into the dealership Claudia helped us test drive cars and finished all the details and paperwork. The Manager gave my kids cookies and candy to distract them lol. It was a great experience because everyone worked fast and were very friendly. I would definitely buy from them again. Thanks everyone :)<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

I submitted an application online and received a phone call from Dan regarding my financing. I called Dan back and after multiple transfers and hangups I was finally able to touch base with Dan. He explained that I would need 2-3k down and asked me if I had that amount, as soon as I stated I did not have such a large amount to put down he hung up on me.  My credit may not be the best but at least other dealers will treat you with respect. Only get a car from Car Credit Auto Group if you have no other options as they are RUDE and UNPROFESSIONAL.</Review>

<review>I wanted to take the time out and give a 5 star rating review for my exsperience buying my car at CARE CREDIT AUTO GROUP. I found them on facebook and when I arrived I was treated with a red carpet Experience. As you know it can be a lenthy process but they were quick and effient as we waited. Claudia was the best. She is kind friendly and professional. Jessica was working hard to make it happen. She was professional and very kind. Together both Claudia and Jessica were the best. No I in team work.

Ok so heres my story. I bought a 2007 Hyundai elantra. It was a nice clean car. Drove nice. No problems. Driving down the freeway 2 weeks ago the oil plug fell out and locked up the motor. After a week of bouncing between car credit and the warranty company who was denying my claim car credit finally said bring it in and "we'll take care of you" Honestly they did. They put me in another car and had me on the road in a cpl hours. I now have a 2005 Toyota solara. Im happy. It cost me a lot of hassle and a week of work but at the end of the day they made it right with full integrity. Your buying a used car. They know as much about the vehicle history as anyone else. Things happen and sometimes nobody is to blame but luck.< /Text>

<Review>Today we came in to car credit auto group and met Claudia Ruby one of the most awesome car sales people I've met. Straight to the point this is how it is and this is how much you qualify for, with your not so great credit. We drove of with a black on black Kia sportage.
Thank you for making it a hassle free buying experience! I will recommend them to everyone with good or bad credit, they have financing options for everyone. Family owned for over 12 years! Thanks again Moe for the help!</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

I appreciate their help on getting me into a car.. they try there best to get you intoa vehicle. Christopher was very helpful and attentive on any concerns or questions I had after I purchased the vehicle and Aric was my sales man . Bad credit ok and 500 down payment is a good closer. Thank you guys.</Review>

<text>This company is trash! 1 Star is far to much, I have never been the one to write a review for a company but in this situation this company deserves it! I spoke to Dan to see if he would be able to assist me in getting a car financed. I applied online and received a call that I was approved. I then received a call from the Finance Manger, and he was the rudest individual I had ever spoken to. How do you wish to gain business in such a rude manner. He literally hung me up when I began to ask questions they stated they would assist in. This company is false advertisement and lacks some serious customer service! I would highly recommend you part from this company! They are a waste of time!</text>< name>

Everyone's different, I get it. I came in with low expectations - actually expecting to be turned away too with how bad my credit and history was, but also with a sliver of hope that they can help me. I've been in contact with Abraham & Dayshawn for a couple weeks, I gave them my story and application filled out online and we made an appointment for me to come in after the new year.

I showed up with the documents required ready for Dayshawn & team to review, they entered everything and in about 10-15 minutes of dealing with the bank and whoever, Aric the Sales Manager introduced himself and led me to their lot for what they could offer me based on my preferred monthly payment and what they were selling. So it's a bit backwards - in that they get all your information first and see what you qualify for, and give you the options, versus other dealerships where you go in picking a car thinking you can get it only to be turned down for whatever reason and then having to settle on a lesser model or whatever.

Once I was happy with the car I chose after a quick test drive which always involves going a circle back to the dealership (in this case, a series of left turns lol but at least there was some road interference: railroad tracks, small dips and hills to go up and long stretches of industrial park roads to really test acceleration and torque), we then came back to discuss final numbers.

This is where other dealerships would differ - CarCredit already has the general number for you based on what you want, not the other way around. Now it's just paperwork of filling out the DMV registration form and the long car finance form, submitting my down payment with Rachelle, and all that other jazz.

In the meantime, my car was getting washed and cleaned up, got my keys and I was done. Total time spent was about 3 hours - which is expected and about average I'd say.

I'd like to extend my thanks to the team for helping me out and getting me in a car when everyone else told me no.<//Text>

<text>They LACK in CUSTOMER SERVICE! They have ZERO experience in FIANCE! I would say they tell you lies but really they just don’t know what they’re doing at all in sales. I dealt with Brandon which he barely knew what he was doing... I wouldn’t recommend this whole in the wall place to no one! If your looking for a HONEST SALESMAN, a new car, low down, and excellent payment go to Fontana Auto Sales ask for Tito!

Came in after my car was totaled didnt have much but thanks to Augustin, Big Moe, and Jay they got me into a beauitful 2013 toyota priusc with 20167miles on it!!! My payments are very low and the hospitality is beyond imaginable my interest is very low as well, they want you driving home and you feel safe. I would definitely recommend anyone who is strapped with cash to come here before ever buying from a private owner.< /review>

Horrible Service here! Started the process online with Tyrone who told us everything that we needed to bring in. Brought everything in and then got told that they wanted us to get financial documents on their computer. HUGE PRIVACY NO NO! We provide the documentation that they wanted for proof of bank account and deposits only to be told yet again that they wanted the full bank statements. Why would anyone need to know where and what someone does on a daily basis. This is a huge reason for identity theft! On top of all of that they cant give any justification as to why it can't be done except for that the "bank" wants the information. The biggest problem is that Tyrone Hainsworth said more than 3 times that the deal was done!!!! BUYER BEWARE and watch out for their FALSE POSITIVE FEEDBACKS!<//Text>

They gave me a car that in less than 30 days already needed tires. Wrong battery. I had to pay out of pocket to get it fixed. The charger plug didn’t even work and they supposedly had fixed it. Also they are not willing to work with people if you are behind $25 they will repo your car. They only care about them making money not about helping people. The transmission is also bad in the car as the mechanic said but I am a female who knew nothing about cars and got taken advantage of. Very unsatisfied.< /Review>

<Review>I found these people on Craigslist and it's fake I have challenging credit and it says it could help with everything lies. I gave them all my info and even got my brother to co-sign for me and haven't heard from these people .

This is by far the worst car place on earth ,I purchased a vehicle with them and have never been late on a payment ,just the other day they took it upon their selves to access my credit card and pay a payment they THOUGHT was late, they had NO right mind to do so unless I was considered late which I wasn't I was far from a late payment 10 days until it was due ACTUALLY. this company discuss me & their further harassments will definitely lead to me sueing and possibly much more. I would never recommend them to anyone they are the most unprofessional business EVER they deserve 0 stars if you ask me . Iwent through car salesman by the name of DON & DAN & I REGRET IT BYFAR WORST SALESMAN / SCAM ARTIST YET DO NOT EVER IN LIFE CONSIDER THIS COMPANY.< /text>

Chris the manager is the one who helped me through this whole process.I had to return once to redue all of my paper work because they changed finance company's. I referred my aunt,she told them I referred her and no one ever contacted to let me know she purchased a car and that they will send me my $100 refferel money.I had to call them and once I did Chris then told me that she didn't purchase the car from him.I was never told it had to be the same person.I was told just refer someone to the the company.Chris then said ok I will still send you the money.I waited over a month since the day I called.My aunt went there herself and told them to send my money.They wrote a check in front of her.I never recieved it.Two months had gone by.In the middle of waiting for this check  my transmission had gone out on the car I purchased from them only 2 1/2 months previously.We had my car towed to them. They wanted to charge me half of $2300 for them to repair it.So now im making payment on a car that does not work, waiting for my referrel money and every time I spoke with Chris he gave me the run around saying he needed to speak with his boss or that the lady who writes the checks is slacking on her job and he would call me back.I heard that several times until I threaten to write a bad review and contact the Better Business Bureau.I then recieved my check a week later.My aunts car has since then broke down She had rust and rocks in her car,wich she was told if your head gakets are busted that's what dealerships do to resale the car.This placr offered to fix it if she paid half.Which she did but now her car payments are extra so she can pay them for fixing her car.It sounds like they have a great scam Sell people busted cars so they can fix it and get paid again!

<name>Shannon Wright</name><Time>1434603868411<//Time><Rating>1< /Rating><text>I spoke to Michael Garde over the course of 6 hours on Facebook today regarding a 2nd car loan. I said never mind after he was rude and thought I was lying about my qualifying details and then some.

Since they marker high end cars, I wanted a Cadillac STS but he wanted my credit and pay stubs first. I asked for proof they had the car I wanted or something similar...he tried to get to me to apply for an '02 Honda!?!

I pushed back as the informed consumer and he became rude, aggressive, and hostile. He ended up blocking me on FB but we weren't even friends, he just didn't want me to blow his cover!!

I would never give anyone or any place a referral or my business with how he was. It was predatory to say the least.</text>< Pictures>

Since I bought the car from here I have had nothing but problems they claimed to fix the car and told me if I had any other problems I would have to pay for it so far I have had the car break down on me three times in three months I'm very disappointed and unhappy about my experience here not only the issues with the car but the owner of the dealership was calling me and harassing me the first month to the point where I had to call the finance company and had them call him and tell him to stop.<//Review>

We wanted McDonald's fries that night so I ordered large fries.  Didn't check the bag when I got it because it was given to me closed.  When I got home, this was my "large" fries.  Kind of a bummer.  Like didn't even try to make it  a large order.  Hopefully this isn't how fries are given at this location all the time.  If this is how fries are served, where else are corners cut.</Review>

<text>I hate giving bad reviews but I have to this time. So I ordered a Quarter pounder with cheese it looked good, at the begining as I looked at it... I noticed the meat was half cooked. It still was pink, I attached the picture's of what was left. I ordered chicken nuggets they gave me no sauce, no ketchup. I was really disappointed😒<//text><Rate>1</Rate><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM1QTfraV6EDgq9dRAX94Myqj0BYo2JvJhAiALv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMAjaAlgT-MkS1koio-w_bSOLCdfok3NukRCe3J=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><user_id>105008207831873634281<//user_id><name>QM M< /name></record></dataset><record>

Worst McDonald's in Long Beach! Order an egg McMuffin and you can notice how it seems like something is missing in the first two bites

There is ! Its called egg, this location uses smaller eggs then other locations.  And notice how the bun is barely toasted. That's because they're using a lower temperature grill to keep operating costs down

Notice how everyone working there is much closer to high school age then most customers. There hiring the least experienced people for the least amount of money

It all adds up! This location completely SUCKS< /Text>

For me, waiting is a good thing because that means I'm getting my food fresh and hot!! 👍🏽👍🏽 When I order the same item at other Mickey D's I receive my food immediately. I don't like that.

<review>I haven't run into an issue as of yet. Been here maybe a handful of times. Sometimes it's a hit or miss. I've have cold fries and then fresh fries. It's just McDonald's. Customer is ok which is my reason for 2 stars.</review></record></dataset><record>

They seemed to be very behind this evening. Not many cars in the line, but it took some time to get our order and a few things were wrong with it. And many things on their menu were either out of stock or no longer being sold.< /review>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>All McDonald's are great! Love the deals they have.  However, since this McDonald's is next to a gas station parking is not that good!  Although, people in general give it negative reviews, I would suggest that if you don't like this particular one go somewhere else. The customer service is good! And the food is excellent! I love McDonald's!!! & Enjoy the big macs & fries.</Text>< Pictures>

This McDonald's next to Lakewood mall there food was much better than the Donald's on Rosecrans in Compton. Lakewood's fries were fresh and crispy and the fish sandwich was light. All in all Lakewood has good workers.  Tables were clean.<//review>

I hadn't had a  McDonalds meal in quite a long time, let me just put it this way. The burger is at least 50% less than it was 20 years ago, but at $9.19 for a big Mac meal, I can think of many other choices where I wouldn't left hungry,. Too bad it's not like it used to be. PS this location in Lakewood was disappointingly unkept< /Text>

I can only say that if you try to order something on the menu and try to omit an ingredient they will not be happy with you. We have ordered a burgers that had cheese with out, and everytime they have given us the cheese. This is after indicating a lactose intolerance.This has happened several times and it got frustrating to the point where we won't go to this location.< /Text>

I've complained to management multiple times but it's always immediately addressed and goes back to the same bad ways within a few days. We've had employees make jokes and insult customers while forgetting to turn off the drive through speaker, food given to us cold (or barely warm), multiple issues with orders missing items (and even had employees tell us we're lying about missing items when we immediately go in to get the order corrected), multiple times we've been over charged and had to argue to get them to correct the pricing to what's advertised on their signage. This really is one of the worst locations (second only to the location on Los coyotes and spring)< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<Review>This is a McDonalds attached to a gas station, so just be aware it's small and difficult to get in and out of. The food has been on par with regular McDonalds locations, but the location makes it difficult for me to give this place a good rating. The ketchup pump never seems to be working, the tables are usually dirty, and the drive through is very difficult to access. The people there have always been very nice and friendly, I really appreciate that they have gone the extra mile to check their toy selection for my son. It's not a bad location, but I unfortunately cannot recommend it.<//Review><Rate>3</Rate><name>Lauren Lost< /name><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Time>

<text>Coffee is super cold and the most of the breakfast items be uncooked like the hash brown, sausage, eggs, breakfast sandwiches. And also fries not even fresh no salt taste very nasty probably the worst McDonald’s I went to.< /text>< name>

Very strange McDonalds. It is attached to a gas station where you can enter through the gas station door or the McDonald's door and end up in the same space. It's not one of those places that has a very good parking lot. In fact when I first came here I actually thought it was a drive through because I didn't see any parking spaces for McDonald's patrons to park. Just before heading out, I finally found approximately 10 spaces tuck into the far corner by the drive-thru that didn't appear to belong to the gas station. Because of their they are pretty difficult to get into, and almost impossible to get out of.
The entire place is really not that clean. I have been here almost an hour and in that time no one has cleaned any of the tables or cleaned the garbage off of the floors.
They do have a pretty steady clientele mostly the drive-thru but many that walk in. Their menu seems complete. Prices are about the same across the board as other McDonald's I have visited. Yes, they do have high chairs!
The personnel seemed extremely pleasant. They tend to talk to each other well, get the job done and in a reasonable time. This is truly a fast food restaurant, the wait here is very short.
If you're looking for quiet, this is not the place to come. There's a lot of noise that comes from the gas station part of the building, the road that runs right beside the building, the drive-through and just the traffic of McDonald's workers and patrons themself.
Would I come back here? Actually I would. There's nothing here that scares me off. I feel safe, I feel secure, and the food was McDonald's food. Isn't that what I walked in for?

Says they open dine in section at 5:30am, but ive been stopping at this location for 3 months now and ive only seen it open before 6am once...which i could deal with if they’d change their signage and have their employees stop telling everyone dine in opens at 5:30.

Twice as of today.< /Review>

Fries were so greasy that they looked like plastic! It took us 3 whole napkins to remove grease from just one box of fries, in fact... The boxes were almost see through from the ammound of grease!

Other then that all of the orders were messed up, and messy tables.<//Review>

<text>The food was stale and utterly gross. I won't be surprised if I get a stomach flu after this and took them exactly 15 minutes to give me my food. Really thinking about suing for selling me stale food. Not even roaches would eat this crap. The service was a bunch of immature people who would rather joke around than do their job. My only recommendation is to stay far from this location and shut it down.< /text>< Pictures>

I recently went to this McDonalds and the service here is great. The employees were very nice and attentive as I ordered. I liked their nice and positive attitudes.</review>

<review>Mister V. Is the district manager for this McDonald's and he is also a long time friend of mine. Not just because we are friends am I writing a review about this McDonald's but because I have been eating at this McDonalds since I was a little girl back in the early 80's. Now that I have children I have the opportunity to enjoy quality time with my children and to enjoy the great service and cleanliness of this venue. I highly recommend this place and it's close to the freeway and residential areas.<//review><Gmap_id>0x80dd32f605884ae3:0xa068e0aa251e7bd4</Gmap_id><user_name>diana salazar CANDIIYUMYUM</user_name></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I am used to having to check my order and rude service from this location! Today was the worst after I had to correct the kid taking the orders twice as to what I actually wanted. I sat a good ten minutes to even move to the pay window! They recently designated two drive thru waiting spaces for order that take a few extra minutes, yet they seem to forget they are there. When I finally arrived at the pickup window (a good 15 min. or more since I ordered)! orders were stacked up on a counter. Mine was wrong (my fault they had changed the meal #'s) No offer was made to make it right! Remember the stacked up orders they must have been sitting there for awhile as when we pulled over to check everything was cold. To annoyed to even try we went home and nuked the food a few seconds! I will never bother with this location I guess I will try the one at Cherry & South!</Text><user_name>Tom Cowan<//user_name>< Rating>

Typical McDonald's food but service is slow. No private bathrooms shares with the gas station.  The dining room is extremely small with limited seating. Very small parking lot ehich is difficult to enter and exit.  Employees tend to be rude.<//text>

Considering the time it wasn't that busy until after I got my food. Getting water took forever because they don't offer it here so you have to buy bottled water. I stuck with the ice.< /Text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Review>Have had way too many crappy experiences at this location.  Tonight was just the icing on the cake.  We get up to the window after waiting over 15 minutes to be told "we are only accepting cash right now."  That was not told to us when we ordered our food and they would not make it right nor give us the food.  We left empty handed.  Rude workers have plagued this location for years.<//Review><user>116920153534765409916</user>< pics>

<Text>My experience at the Mcdonald's was horrible. Considering the location of the restaurant  I expected it too have a different vibe. The service was the worst I have recieved, the two girls at the windows were very rude and never greeted/welcomed me. If you are looking for a Mcdonald's with great customer service I do not advise anyone to go to certain location. s#12 crew i.d 41 ,< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x80dd32f605884ae3:0xa068e0aa251e7bd4<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I wasn't at McDonald's they probably drove by McDonald's because I can't even those fit anymore I hate it so much as a kid and now it makes my stomach sick I get really bad stomach aches and I don't want to go on and on and on and so I don't know if you eat it too much be aware that your stomach will end up you will end up at a gastro at a doctor's office so please be careful what you eat at McDonald's and how long you eat their food for< /Review>

<Review>I used to go once a week, but my last 2 visits were horrible. They gave me half of the fries when you compare to other macdonalds. I went to talk to the manager and her excuse was that they weight the amount of fries in each order. I told her that will then rather go to other mcdonalds and she didn't care. Horrible customer service!<//Review><user_name>Stefanie Nicholls</user_name><Rating>1< /Rating><time>1402083708377</time><pics>None< /pics></record></dataset><record>

I work across the street from this McDondals location, so it is USALLY
convenient. But not today. There is a gas station at this location as well, so
on my lunch break I thought I'd knock out lunch and getting gas at the same
time. So I got my gas and then proceeded to the drive-thru line. Usually it is
very quick, but it was way slow today. There were 3 or 4 cars in front of me and
i waited over 10 mins, and still wasn't at the mic to order. Thats when a car
from off the street came and cut me in line. Now I know it's not your fault that
the customer was rude, but when it's that busy, there is usually an employee
standing by the drive-thru helping take orders and directing the line. If they
were out there, then it wouldn't have caused such a problem. They could even
close that second entry from the street during busy hours to avoid this.Also, I
called this McDonalds location to let the manager know what was going on, and
her advice to me was "to enter from the street side" (like the other customer
did to me) and go in that way. This does in no way fix the problem. This just
causes more problems for the future, and I am not going to be rude and cut other
people that have been waiting for who knows how long.  It's an easy fix and the
manager didn't seem to think it was to much of an issue but because if this I
didn't even have time to go elsewhere and eat. I will not be coming to this
location again! Horrible customer service. I am not "lovin' it"!</review>
