Awesome spot. I order a couple of Steak n Shrimp tacos and they were ready in less than 10 minutes. Very filling (lots of meat) and delicious with avocado, cabbage, onions, cilantro and sauce! Came with a large side of chips and salsa, good deal. I recommend this spot for taco cravings and I will return.</text>

<review>I came here today for my birthday dinner since I wanted to try a new place and I has been waiting to try the food here. I tried to online through the website but it said it wasn't accepting any orders so I called them instead. They said they are open for phone orders but I asked if I could place my order through yelp and they said yes. So I got the Turf Burrito with Carne Asasa Steak with no rice or beans and I asked for extra tomato and cilantro. My food was ready within like 15 minutes compared to yelp telling me it would he ready in 20-40 minutes. I thought their burritos was very good, all that was missing for me was some pico de gallo and hot sauces. I think they want you to basically use the sauce that comes with the burrito which is their Chipotle Sauce. I wasn't sure if I had to ask for pico de gallo or hot sauce when I pick up my order but I'll try next time.< /review>< Pictures>

Had the surf n turf burrito, it was good and would get it again but maybe less baja sauce would bring out more of the steak n shrimp flavor.  The guacamole with chips was very good!< /Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPtt5bx-Dq4W_A57wTQTFQyLT0UL1EjGm2Tykru=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPKRJAklE3qMGcsii9E1gUfTquTo2e9CTgEwE7z=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< response>

<text>My Son has eaten here several times and really likes it. Me? I'm a picky eater. You know how there are taco places you go and can't seem to find it all under one roof?? Here, you can! The tacos are good, the salsa's are good, the guacamole is good. The chips are good! Like, even the service too?? YES!! I'd recommend you try it at least once. I'm a huge supporter of small/family owned business.  Stop in and say hello to Andy! Super nice guy.</text>< pictures>

I showed up at a very slow 1pm for lunch. Never been here before so i always go to a new place with an open mind.

Fish Tacos: the meat was overcooked, and there was just way too much cabbage/slaw. No fish flavor at all.

Asada Tacos: The meat should have a very simple savory flavor and the condiments should do the talking. I feel like meat was over spiced, which in turn changed the flavor of the salsa. Just not my cup of tea.

I don't think the owners really focused on creating a good flavor spectrum. They should really consider hiring a cook that really knows Mexican food.

I don't want this to be a hate post, or a negative feedback. Hopefully it is seen as constructive criticism.</text>

This is just a very small place but the location is great. The tacos I always get is very good. Today I brought my friend & she likes it too. I'm glad that they now put chairs and more tables outside. Their chipotle sauce in their taco is making it so delicious.< /Review>

<Resp>None<//Resp><review>The service here is great and is the only reason why it gets a three star rating. The tacos are really expensive but the size matches it's price. The fish tacos are just ok. It was pretty bland taste wise. But the cashier was very polite and attentive. He knew the menu and was able to advise me on what to get. First time trying this place but the food doesn't make me want to go back for more.<//review><userid>118143161656142903075<//userid><Date>1590163874582<//Date><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< gmapID>

Stumbled upon this tiny taco joint while driving up the street. Andy (the owner) was outside & greeted us with a huge smile. We ordered the steak & shrimp tacos and chicken turf torta. Both were delicious! The tacos were equal parts citrusy, tangy & sweet and the cabbage slaw gave it the perfect crunch with each bite. This is a great neighborhood taco joint to support with the best customer service and even better food!< /review>

Love this place! End up here basically every week since it's close by to where my wife gets her allergy shots. Has the best breakfast burritos at a reasonable price. Love to bug the owner about not having coffee but he is working on it. Was even willing to help out when my car wouldn't start after we had ordered. Just a great place and great service.</review>

<review>It looks like family own super tasty i got two carne asada tacos, the other got a quesadilla and a burrito the spicy it's a flavoured not impossible to eat as other places. We really enjoyed the food.

I wanted to order a burrito in a combo (a combo includes rice and beans for $3). My burrito was about $8, so with the rice and beans, my total was about $11. I got my burrito and waited for the rice and beans, which didn't come. They ended up charging me an extra $3 because they said they hadn't charged me for it before. Should've kept my receipt. Wish I could give them 0 stars for cheating me out of my money.< /text>

Damn, those tacos were delicious.  Larger than your average street taco, full of avocado, two filled me up.  I thought the tortillas were delicious.  I'm hungry for more right now.</text>

OMG what a place. Probably the best burrito I've ever had was the steak and shrimp burrito. Everything is made fresh and delicious. Also the mahi-mahi tacos are amazing. Highly recommend this place to anyone who loves tacos and burritos.< /Text>

This place is a complete joke
Four tacos for 15 dollars and the tortillas aren’t made by hand smh you want real tacos go to a real Mexican taco shop!  Not all taco shops have mini tacos by the way and this is not gourmet especially using that brand of tortillas   You over price your “ gourmet tacos “ I know what I’m talking about though< /text>

Great stop in Chico, the patio is shady and well spaced.  The beer is solid, with their Hazies and Kettle Sours leading the pack I think.  But they do have porter and Stout options as well if that's your jam.  The owner was there when we came by and she was super friendly, the other beertenders were great as well.  I'd definitely go back.< /Review>

I love this place. We moved away from Chico three years ago and we still try to hit this place up every time we visit. If you've never been, I recommend the 'bout it 'bout it beer, you'll love it.</Text>

<Text>Outstanding variety of different styles of craft beer. Small session and larger batch beers on tap, in cans and To-go in growlers. Excellent knowledgeable beer tenders, who can steer you to the style and taste that you want. Friendly place, clean, safe, distanced, masked and gloved. Tables all distanced. Musicians behind plexiglass for theirs and our safety. Great group of local regulars and new people stopping by. Food trucks are outstanding and accommodating with changing specials. Give it a whirl, you won't be disappointed. Tell them short Sherry sent you 🍺💖😁🐉<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>{'time': 1606686400427, 'text': 'Thank you so much Sherry!

Fantastic place. Only stopped in for 2 quick beers, but it was enjoyable. Especially during this pandemic. A nice outdoor area, supplied with heat. Very comfortable place.</review>

Be sure to stop in now that they are open 7 days a week and a food truck most nights. If that's not your jam, bring your own food! Dog & kiddo friendly ❤️ Live music on Sundays.

Sometimes you also get lucky and they're kicking out the 80s New Wave and Punk jams.

Kudos to the brewers too as Greengate, Greenwall, Winner-Winner! and Winterfall are all solid brews!

Highly recommended!!!

Secret Trail is a great place to get local craft beer. They brew on site and have an awesome hiking/outdoorsy feel to the place. Honestly it's a really great mix up to getting locally Crafted beer and not having to face the crowded taproom at Sierra Nevada.(I love Sierra Nevada too) They have snacks, chips, trail mix, popcorn and they often have a food truck outside too. But it would be nice to see them have a variety of food trucks or be able to make small plates in house. Overall so excited that this place opened. They aren't open weekends or Monday and Tuesday to the public.</text>

<review>I went there on Valentine’s Day for their cupcakes and beer pairing. They were packed so we ended up needing to ask them if they could provide more seats outside. Despite being super busy they obliged quickly. It was a little chilly outside so while I was waiting for the tables and chairs to get set up I was shivering a little. The lovely lady, whom I’m assuming is an owner or manager, noticed and offered me a blanket!!! A blanket!!! It may seem silly but that blanket made my whole day. I was warm and enjoyed some delicious beer and cupcakes. I cannot wait to go back.<//review>< pics>

< Review>
I wasn't aware that the "industrial heart" of Chico held such treasure, but my first inkling came when, thirsty from a trying day, largely spent considering how the day might be better spent, I slunk into my previously favorite watering hole (whose name shall not be uttered here out of respect for the dead) but after settling into a dark corner, I was informed that my standby Porter had just foamed it's last -- the keg was dry ...... but "you might wanna try the Trail of Darkness, it's pretty good". Initially shaken by the sudden and unexpected loss of my dearest libation,  a multitude of emotions swept over me; disappointment, anger, even a sense of betrayal rose like gore in my throat, rendering it difficult to croak out a numb "okay, I'll try one". I remained slumped and brooding until a glass was slid under my nose -- and here I have to admit that the aroma that wafted up from it's foamy brow was not off-putting at all. In fact it was perfect! I raised the glass to my lips and was once again not disappointed. It was in a word ... er, make that words, the best Porter of my experience. Slamming it down, my fingers frantically flew over my phone in an effort to ferret out the source of this wonder, and lo, Secret Trail was just mere blocks away -- how had I squandered so much time in ignorance of it's existence? But then, what's the use of mourning the past, it's the present  that we live in, and I pledged to make up for lost time -- and I have! Simply put, there's not a bad brew in the house (rare for a micro brewery) and many offerings are in the "best of class" category. In addition to the Trail of Darkness the, Hundinator, Hands Across The Pond, the Barrel Aged Baltic Porter, and Nitro Baltic Porter -- respectively, a Porter, Doppelbock, Barleywine, and two variations on their Baltic Porter are all best of class offerings. So if you like beer of unstinting quality, and bearded men, this is the place for you!< /Review>

Good quality beer with many options. As someone who gets a splitting headache halfway through one of the other local brewery's beers, I appreciate this local option. Nice atmosphere as well. Electric oats!< /review>

Absolutely outstanding beer. I’ve been coming in often since opening day and it keeps getting better. I have yet to have a beer that wasn’t enjoyable. The customer service is on point even when they are slammed/busy. They usually have a food truck hanging around in the parking lot which is cool. My only complaint is that they are closed Tuesdays, but hey everyone needs a day off ;) Keep it up STBC!</Text>

<Text>Great beers and fun people.  Good mix of flavors and not the crowds of Sierra Nevada! Its also not a bad sign for a business where you often see the owners on the same side of the bar as you enjoying the nectar.</Text>< Pics>

<rating>5</rating><Review>1st impressions wield a heavy influence.  This new brewery in our hometown, Chico, will add to the destination goals of more micro brew adventures for travelers round about the Golden state and beyond. We were greeted by a bustling and friendly line of suds enthusiasts and waited for what turned out to be a delicious pour of Lights Out, a baltic porter touting 8.7% and as smooth as a velvety warm night in front of the campfire. Check this place out!!!  P.s.   No food served, but a food truck is on site and a great Pastrami down the street.  The iterations of product of the potations produces pleaseantly palatable pints.
....a year or so later...still as good.
And going...always a good winter porter<//Review>< pictures>

<Review>This is only my personal opinion. I love my sour beers and they didn't have it. Also, no food. Just snacks.
But overall, its a great place to hang out! They have board games! Beautiful interior! Very clean! 7/10.

<review>Stumbled across this little brewery in South Chico.  Good beers at fair prices.  Rotating food trucks, they do have some bar snacks but no kitchen of their own.  And some live music.  Go check it out.</review>< Pictures>

We heard about the grand opening from a friend and swung by before going downtown. The place looks and feels amazing with its Chico-esque decoration. The staff were really friendly even though I'm sure they had had a long day with the opening and must have been tired by the time we got there. We got a flight of beers for $10 and the pour of each was a great amount for the price you pay. I also bought a patch and a glass before leaving. I really love the quote they have on their glasses "Live and Drink off the Beaten Path" which definitely speaks to my Chico side! As I'm not a beer connoisseur, I can't speak to that but I can say all their options were great. I prefer lighter beers so their Hazy Trail was my favorite but I was surprised at the taste of their darks as they were great as well. This feels like it will be a great place to hangout at after work or simply meet up with some friends on the weekend. While they don't have food options aside from snacks, the food trucks do setup outside so you can call and see what options they have the day off. Overall, you need to try this place!<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Lively place where locals go for lovingly made craft beer. The kolsch, Baltic porter, the rye ale stand out but IPAs and other styles are on offer as well. Definitely worth a visit.<//review>

<review>I have a start up and have been renting space here since Feb. Great place, great people, great service with a start-up focus. The offices have a great view of the bay, and the benefits/perks are real and worth it. IE Zoom Conference and AWS have helped us get started. There are several mentors that you can network with and it's good to collaborate or get advice from a few of the other founders. Highly recommend!

- Edit 5 months later. We were accepted into another incubator and we have bounced around between several office spaces in the area. In my opinion, being in an office space that is as nice as OneValley, and with their focus on StartUps, their is not a better space. What I've found is that many office spaces are rundown old buildings with big names, uncomfortable desks with high prices, or is hosted by an incubator that is not a tech focus. OneValley has a good combination that will make your team feel good about where they work, with all the parking space you could want, and the staff that you will love.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>{'time': 1600968153968, 'text': 'Thank you Lowel we appreciate your feedback, and the San Mateo team absolutely love getting to see you each day.

<review>Beware, SCAM! In their Passport program they offer you huge discounts from their partners like Amazon, Azure, Hubspot etc. They would charge you for that $500/year. After paying this amount you will learn that all they do is to redirect you to their partners websites (using affiliate links). For example, they offer on their website $10,000 AWS credits. You need to pay $500 to redeem it. You pay, you click redeem, and you end up on aws.amazon.com website. Keep away!< /review></record>

<Review>What a privilege to work at GSVLabs managed space. While the building could use a light makeover inside, the staff are really wonderful, and the amenities are cool-- great speaker series and events, drinks, coffee, snacks, in the kitchen.

Glad to work with them.<//Review>< Pictures>

(Translated by Google) You are a startup and need to scale your solution, sure you need the cloud. We bought the GSV Labs package for Treasury Bonds Plus and it helped us a lot. Yamini Bhaskar's service and patience was incredible. I highly recommend the service from OnValley / GSV Labs! I can't wait to be able to use more of the cowork and network services.

You can never go wrong with Burros and Fries. I always order the Surf and Turf burrito. But I've had their rolled tacos and tacos which are equally delicious. A bit pricier but worth it to me. This location the staff was great, the place was clean, and you can dine in if you wish.<//review>

<Text>It's okay. Not the nicest of service. The food is alright. They do good fries. I've gotten sick at a number of burros and fries, so I'm not a huge fan of the chain. This one is the better I've come by though.<//Text>< Pictures>

I’m always hesitant to try new burrito places but this massive beast was tasty. I got a California burrito the the meat was great as well. Will definitely stop by every time I do laundry in the area.< /Text>< pictures>

<text>My order came to $4.29, so I gave the cashier $5.25 thinking she said $4.24, so when she started counting out ( should be $.96) I said " I thought you said $4.24", masks make it hard to hear most or the time! She gave me $.76 in change and a blank receipt (forgot I gave her a quarter!) Anyway , I just wanted some little dish of chicken for my son (who is a dog )! She charged me $1.99 for a chicken taco and then I was the last order called after 6 people ( who came in after me ! )got their orders! When I asked for a receipt , no answer ,or about the change, same! I guess mistakes happen !< /text>< Response>

I have been going to the Burros and fries on Telegraph for a while now, and I am excited that they finally put one in National City! The veggie fries are delicious, and they put Cotija cheese on it. I like that they have a small order for the fries, I could never finish the large order. I will definitely be going back.<//Review>

<Review>Called a couple of minutes before I arrived at the restaurant so that i could place an order and be out if there quickly in order to not waste too much time from my lunch break, but no one answered the phone. I got to the the restaurant and when I walked in, the lady behind the counter was having a conversation on her cell phone. When I got to the counter, she made a hand gesture saying that she was almost done with her conversation, which I had no complaints about. But tell me why this lady had me just standing right in front of her for about 10 minutes and she was still of the phone! Seriously?! I decided to leave because I didn’t have too much time left before I had to get back to work. When I walked out, she was still on the phone. Didn’t even say anything to me as I was leaving. Also, while I was there, the phone rang and she didn’t even bother to look in it’s direction. Pretty sure that’s why no one picked up my call the first time 🤔< /Review><Gmap_id>0x80d9523ab8a5bd0f:0x41749a81590d851b<//Gmap_id><response>None<//response><Date>1597096047868</Date><pictures>None</pictures><user_id>106807109860128870005<//user_id>< rating>

It was a great experience. The place is neat and clean. The food is freshly cooked and presented well. Alot of people come in here on tuesday probably because of the Tuesday taco. I just saw it after I ordered. The staffs are attentive and nice. Its my new favorite place.< /Review>

We tried the fish taco and it was good. We'll come back on a tuesday and I guess twill taste better, great that is. We also tried their take on burrito and carne asada and they were equally good. Will definitely come back on a tuesday.

If i could give 0 stars i would 2 of my orders wrong and even the lid says how its supposed to be. I called them to tell them and Veronica says that it wasn't her fault because she didn't cook them that it was Ramon. Then she wanted me to go back and gave them the bowls (which it wouldn't be a problem but i was at work already) Veronica basically said that if i wanted my money back to take the bowls after work. This problem could be avoid if they would do their job correctly and i was giving this place a second chance since is not the first time giving orders wrong.<//Text>

Pretty OK. I want to like it overall but they are so inconsistent. Some items are delicious and then they just messed up other dishes. Even the same items differ on different visits. We got potato tacos once and loved them. Then the last time we got them that were burnt on one side. So half the tacos is charred and the cook saw that then still added the ingredients to the inside of the tacos. Other times they are amazing, like with sopes. We get those and they were great. Then we also get enchiladas and the forgot to put chicken in them. But then they nail nachos perfect.

Is there any QC or is that old fashioned?<//Review>

Came in to try the caldo de res. It was delicious and very filling. Salsa bar had great options, almost tried them all.

Clean restaurant and joyful employees were the cherry on top.

Will definitely be back to try other items.< /review>

<review>Burrito was actually really good. The service however was terrible! Walk in and the cashier is talking to one of her friends while another customer waits to order. Finally takes the 1st customer's order, then makes me wait also while she steps AWAY from the counter to finish her conversation with her friend, then takes my order. Not going back to this place again, but thank you to the cook for the great food.😒
*UPDATE*
Decided to give this place another try. Food was still pretty good. Fortunately there's been a change in front end staff. New cashier was exceptionally friendly and went above and beyond. Total 180° from the last visit. 4 Stars earned, will definitely eat here more often!😋😁< /review><GmapID>0x80d9523ab8a5bd0f:0x41749a81590d851b< /GmapID><user>103053942086339842344<//user><Rating>4<//Rating></record>

<Text>It was ok. I didn't go back because I was charged twice for a meal. They cleared it up but still the cashier needs to pay attention to what they are doing. I orders the carne asada quesadilla. The guacamole and sour cream came outside of the meal.<//Text>< Pictures>

Always hits the spot. Favorite morning burrito: hashbrown. The bacon and hashbrown are cooked crispy, paired with sour cream, cheese, egg, and sausage. Try it!<//Text>

Very good food it's like a top notch taco shop😊</text>
</record>
</dataset><record>
<text>The first time I came when they first opened I thought to myself finally a taco place I can enjoy. The food was tasty and made with whatever specific request we had ( example, extra crispy rolled tacos)

I went twice recently and at first I thought to myself maybe it was a bad day even tho we spent about 40$ , so I gave it another try today  and I was pretty disappointed that I'm now convinced they changed the quality of their food.
The guacamole and sour cream are tasteless and WATERY 😡 not to mention hard to find on your rolled tacos, BOTH TIMES!!!.
I made up my mind I wont be retuning back here again unfortunately.

consistancy and quality is needed in our area & this place no longer stands out, and is just like every Other taco shop around the corner in National city 😒</text>< Rate>

Ordered the Cotija’s burrito and couldn’t not taste or see the Asada steak. It seems their portions are not accurate. Food quality is good. Just problem with portions. Also if you are going to mop please use fragrance free chemicals. Mopping while guest are at your restaurant with a fragrance on you chemicals caused me not to enjoy my burrito... just a thought.</review>

So, its 9:23 PM. and the store closed at 10 PM. My brother and I, walk in and are ready to order. The cashier turns around after talking to the cooks and tells us "we're closed". My brother asks "why? the hours outside the store say this store closes at 10pm". Her response in her very high pitch voice was "I know". Bruh.. we were hungry so we didn't even bother arguing. We ended going home to eat some sandwiches. Not that there's anything wrong with sandwiches, just saying, Burros and Fries could've saved us some time lol</Text>

<review>If you are going to close 15min earlier then on your set time, why have times in the first place. And why not lock your doors and turn off your open sign, then have people park their car, walk up to the counter just to say where closed early. No one like to drive late night to get food just to find that the Buissnes doesn't follow their own posted times.<//review><Name>randy nieves<//Name>< rating>

I received the order and they didnt put guacamole, it's fine they made a mistake so I told them they didnt make it how I ordered it.So they made it again, or so I thought they just added guacamole and gave me the same burrito back...like really? It was a mess. So I asked them if they could make it again, and again to my surprise they just took out the meat etc...and put it a new tortilla again a complete mess inside. The cook is unbelievable, I didnt feel comfortable going back and asking them to do it again. I would like management to reach out to me. Thank you.<//Review>< Pics>

My go-to for Mexican food. Very reasonably priced and they offer different sizes for their carne asada fries? That's awesome! If I'm feeling like cutting back some I can go with a small plate or if I wanna indulge... hahaha! The only downside to this place is the parking.</Text>

The whole meal was under $5 before taxes. It was good AND filling. And the tables were very clean.

Not 5 stars because there was a fly in the building and the restroom needed a little attention..but the restroom was way nicer than many other eateries. 😉<//Review>< pictures>

I only go here for breakfast and usually get the chilaquiles, they are good but if you add any egg to it it's usually hit or miss as they end up over frying the egg. Today I tried the machaca a and I must say I was presently surprised the shredded beef has a really good flavor to it.<//Text>

<review>I usually love this place, their food is typically on point. However, today I got two orders of their carne asada fries and they were absolutely disgusting. They seemed to have over cooked the fries to where they crumbled in your mouth. They plopped on the ingredients in heaping amounts, don't get me wrong, I love cheese, guac and sour cream and meat but the fries were swimming in it. You'd think the fries would've became soggy from all the ingredients however, they did not. I will not be going back to this established.< /review>< pictures>

Gave a 1 because there is no choice for 0 , they try to sell you Caldos but have no utensils to go along with it , and when yuh ask they just say oh yes we don’t have spoons , so how are you supposed to eat your take out food when the restaurant can’t even provide utensils for the food 2 days in a row , I had been coming here for about a week straight for caldo de res and would spend about $20-$30 a night on dinner , never again especially with the I don’t care attitude from employees , will definitely be spending my money else where , not burros and fries , I work in Customer Service and that is not how you run a business ! Your are located in the middle of 3-5 grocery stores and you can’t even have spoons available for your customers , what a JOKE!!! Ugh< /Text>

He suggested surf and turf burrito or the surf and turf fries. So I ordered one of each. I got the surf and turf burrito and my husband got the surf and turf fries. The surf and turf fries I expected them to be better. You only get like 4 or 5 shrimps. And the bottom of the fries get a little dry once the condiments are gone. But the burrito... Was excellent. Good blend of carne asada to shrimp. Would not get the fries again but would definitely get the burrito.</Text><Name>Diana Lugo<//Name><Pics>None</Pics><time>1515482575354<//time>< Rating>

The last 2 times they’ve forgotten to putt chipotle sauce on my burrito and now after 4 months of giving them a chance again they forgot to put shrimp in my burrito wich they charged me extra for wich is ok if they would of actually put the shrimp in it!! So i go back and the cook who made it claimed he did put the shrimp in it and the other cook just decided to re make me a new one wick was on point but the one the cashiers gave me and attitude and look when she handed me the new burrito that now they have lost me for good
I mean come on I payed almost $17 dollars for this burrito and i get an attitude for what I payed for???<//Text>

Just another mexican joint for me. Beans are better than most places, and it satisfies the craving when mexican food is wanted. Open salsa bar is a plus< /Text>

I'm always looking for vegetarian options and tried the Veggie Quesedilla. It was sooo good I let the cashier know and asked if they have other locations in south bay (of San Diego). I learned of one closer to me and took a menu! I'll be back!!</review>< Pictures>

One cali burro with asada with a special request to add Adobada which the charged 1.75 for it .. Which i Didn't get!!!!!!and the wife was not happy wife her surf fries she said and i quote " stingy mo fos !! With the shrimp and meat" and my kid with her bean and cheese kids meal she hated the bean and cheese . she said and i quote " the beans taste old " never again .. I guess what they say is right ..

Ive had their food before from a different location and like their chicken flautas. Thought i would pick up another order to go today. Ordered chick flautas but got beef instead, no salsa in the bag and their price is higher in the store than what is posted online. Unhappy. Plus i had to ask for the drink that comes with my meal. Get it together please and update your bloody website. Your clerk tells me you raised ur prices 2 weeks ago as if im supposed to know this.😡</Text>

<text>The best Mexican chain around san diego. I used to love Lolitas until they started using their brand name to talk instead of their food.

Fortunately Burros and fries is now, in my opinion, the better Mexican food chain.

The big papa burro (lol) is huge and can be shared between two people. Their Carne Asada fries is the bomb.

Prices can be a bit expensive but you pay for what you get.<//text>< Name>

<Text>They tried to find ways to charge me more. It did not feel right when I was charged $55 at first only to tell me that my car was not ready for the Smog because it looks like someone worked on my car recently and disconnected the battery. The last car maintennance I had and the last people who touched my Honda car were last month with the Honda Dealership itself, so I asked them about it and they said they did not even touch nor disconnected anything. Then, the guy at the front desk told me to drive my car 40 more miles and go back to them with $20 to get the certificate. I came back and was asked if I drove 40 miles and I said more than that because I work every day and drive about a total of 40 minutes each day to work and back. Then, they said my car was still not ready and asked if they could just drive my car around so I let them. The guy who drove my car came back and said it's finally ready but he only drove 2 miles. Seriously?? That's already a total of more than 50 miles total this week since they asked me to drive 40. I was charged about $28 with a total of $83 to pass my car for Smog. It looks and feels like people in the business are taking advantage of this COVID situation. They were NOT even wearing a mask when they are supposed to, NO sign stating everyone must be 6 ft apart, NO sanitizers, NO other signs that the Corona Virus, per state, policies are being enforced, and the chairs inside where the customers sit are next to each other without space. I would hate to have this business closed down for not enforcing health protocols, so Im not coming back to this place instead and write a review to give a heads up to those citizens who care about the situation. If you don't care, then this review is not for you.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

I seldom write a review and this is one of them. Don’t go to this place...... They will reap you off!!!! They will let you sign the paperwork and pay for their services at once even though you didn’t pass the smog check. That’s how crooked this smog place is. I went to LINCOLN SMOG CHECKS and have a second opinion and my smog check pass. So I’m warning everybody not to go to this ACE smog check. Go somewhere else.....Don’t take a risk going to this place, they will rip you off!!!!!!!</Review>

Love this place. Honest smog checks for an affordable price. They post coupons and are quick to service the vehicle.  I've brought all 5 cars of mine here and no upsell on anything. They truly are awesome for the service they provide.  Will always come back here. Highly recommend this place.< /Review>

Overall good experience. Walked in, and I was serviced very quickly. Sayed at the counter was very efficient and friendly. He even honored the coupon for me when I forgot to present it before service (it says on the coupon you need to show it before you’re bill is written up). It was an honest mistake but he honored it. I ended up paying $37 instead of $55 for my car! Thanks!<//Text>

2nd time on ACE smog and great service always happy to come and smog my cars. Great customer service 100%
If your type of person that's don't like waiting at the DMV lines and your time this is the place. Reasonable price for  vehicle transfer.
Back for 3rd time to smog my f350 1994. Thanks ACE SMOG !! Best in Town...<//Review>

They went above and beyond my expectations. I was planning on getting a quick smog inspection and then having to spend 3 hours at the DMV just to renew my registration. Little did I know they are licensed to issue and renew your DMV registration card and stickers. Yes it was an extra $30 because they have to process the paperwork but it was well worth it in the end. I was in and out of there in less than 30 minutes. I highly recommend this place.</text>

Great prices, very quick. Just find the coupon on Yelp. About $20 cheaper than another place wanted to charge.</Text>

This place is a JIP! Don't go here, guy has all these hidden fees, doesn't tell you till it's time to pay. Over $70.00 bucks for a simple test, they just make an already aggravating deal worse. Staff is rude and creepy..  It's a little Bloweeuppee there too if ya know what I mean..< /Text>

I really give reviews but felt I had to do this one.  I am just going to tell you what happened to me at this place and you be the judge. I took my truck to do the smoke check and the truck pased but not the visual inspection.  I had replaced the catalytic two years ago and the part number does not match the CA list. After I came back to retest they have charged me $20.00 additional. I know that most smog test shops give free retest if original test failed. For this shop  it is good business to fail you first time because they charge you $56.00 for first test and then $20.00 for the retest because you will pay, alternative is to go somewhere else and pay $55.00 once more.< /Text>

You be the judge..

I go get a smog check from here and i just wanted to check the price but the moment i stepped out of the car the guy grabs my keys out of my hands and starts to work on it immediately, and tells me to do paperwork inside
I came bc a friend recommended it, and that they said the service and price is always good
I begin paperwork (at this point its too late to stop them, they already began the process) and when i pay they charged me $75...for a smog check....

My bf goes for a smog check w the same make/model car and they only charge him 55, and they didnt even try to pull the same bs they did to me

-never going back-

Only nice thing i can say is whether they're taking advantage or doing the actual work they are very quick about it< /Text>

<Text>These people promised to tell me what exactly was wrong if i failed the test.
After it did, they purposely avoided to give the details and suggested that they can fix it themselves for the price of $375?!? So I took it to another shop and what do you know, my car passed.

What does that tell you?

The review from Umair Attari shouldn't count. He runs the place. Was that sneaky or what!<//Text>< Pics>

Horrible place of service. Left my car there only to come back to see the staff drinking beers and a dent on my car door. Do yourselves a favor and stay far away from this place.</review>

I've never had acrylics done before so I was a little nervous but the girl that did my nails took care of me and didn't hurt me at all. I am so happy with the outcome of my nails. I'll definitely be coming back.< /review>

<Review>I had two nail break on me within the first three days after getting gel french tip manicure.I even had them made short so I'm super surprised that they broke I even tipped them well I thought.It was a gift for my daughter for us both to get nails done and sadly they did not even last I'll have to have them redone by the 2nd of March....the gal and guy working were super friendly and cool but the nails didn't last.< /Review>< Rate>

<Text>I wouldn’t normally Leave a negative review at a one star but I’ve had three back to back bad experiences. I have been charged double for having to thin out my nail, something that was his mistake, from a massive blob to a semi normal size. Prices are marked “and up” so you never know what they’re going to charge. I walked in when they are open after I had made a call to make sure they can take me and then was refused at the door. I’ll stick to one of the several other places in town.  Have you been to Tammys they’re pretty good and reasonable with secure pricing.< /Text>< Pics>

Update: Sadly, the good of my first visit didn't last. Don't waste your time here. Poor service consistently the multiple times I came back hoping for a repeat of my first visit. One hit wonder, but ultimately a poor place for a pedi. Also... will not honor an appt time and will make an appt wait 1hr+ for other walk-ins.< /review>

They need to hire more nail technicians because the wife husband and there mother are overworked that's why when you ask them for a design or something, one of them act like there too lazy to do it so he/she tries to convince you to do something else which is annoying 🙄🤦🏽‍♀️</review>

<review>Bad experience from the time I walked in the door.....the man was very rough with the file, left snags on nails,....the lady couldn't get the design I picked out right, kept smearing polished nails, couldn't put a sticker on my nail without messing it up....very non professional....would not recommend to anyone !<//review>< Pictures>

The reviews were right, this is definitely a must-try. Flavors were rich but overpowering and the prices were very competitive for the area. Enjoyed the seafood in taro basket, char kway teow and vegetables!</Text>

Pineapple fried rice with a paper umbrella on it.  That's what everyone should order.  Not only does it look good, it tastes good!  It's a friendly, family oriented atmosphere that serves up good South East Asian cuisine.  Conveniently located near my mom's house, so, we do dine here often.< /Review>

I love, love, loved this place -- It's been days since my visit and I'm still dreaming of that French onion soup. OMG. Light and savory, not-too-salty broth with the perfect balance of onions, and topped with the most gorgeous and thick layer of baked Gruyere cheese. I'd let the photo do the talking but I'm actually not convinced that it fully does it justice.< /text>

<review>We really like the food there. Almost all other Malay restaurants in the area have closed over the year - so we have great hopes for this one. They have almost all the dishes we like and the portions are very good and pretty big.< /review>< pictures>

The food is delicious. Lychee drink is wonderful. Tried some of my friend's veggie soy and it was cryspy. Very good overall. Make sure you know what you want. It is not easy to ask questions with the staff.</Review>

A nice, clean escape from the bustling city street with reasonably authentic food(according to my girlfriend that lived in Malaysia. The service wasn't the friendliest and they laid down the oil pretty heavy but it's worth a solid 3.5 stars.< /Review>

Interesting Asian fare with a different twist. If you're tired of every other Chinese restaurant in Chinatown then this is the place.</Text>

<date>1439153524062< /date><Review>Chilli Padi serves excellent Malaysian cuisine, in a sea of Chinese restaurants in Oakland Chinatown. This place looks (and is) new compared to almost every other restaurant in Oakland Chinatown (except maybe Shooting Star Cafe on Webster St). Inside, the restaurant is very clean and looks new (because it is) and the atmosphere consists of several muted TVs usually showing HGTV/Food Network. I can safely assume Chilli Padi will stay in business for a while, as the food and service is top-notch. Just about every single dish here is fantastic, and the service is prompt--the servers are quick to take note of water glasses that need refilling, and if you need to box leftovers to take home (which they do for you). The manager is a very friendly dude, and can be helpful if you need help deciding what to try.

As for the food itself...if you're wondering what Malaysian food is, it's basically a mix of Thai, Chinese and Indian cuisine with more of a flavorful (and sometimes spicy) side. My favorite dishes here are mango chicken, string beans belachan and singapore fried vermicelli. Note that while most dishes are designed to be ordered and eaten family-style (e.g. mango chicken is not a 'complete meal/comes with rice' dish, you'd have to order the rice separately), many fried rice and noodles dishes are pretty complete meals on their own as they often come with multiple meal ingredients such as chicken, shrimp and a variety of vegetables. They serve free dessert soup after your meal, usually a sweet tapioca and potato soup or my personal favorite, sweet black rice soup. Note that if you want a less spicy version of a dish, you can tell the waiter or waitress taking your order and they will ask the cooks to tone the spice down.

Overall, an excellent restaurant in a rather run-down looking location (for now, at least). I say, at least give it a try if you're unsure--you probably won't regret it!</Review><Response>None</Response></record>

Ground controller was impatient and demonstrated unnecessary roughness. Very condescending tone of voice and instruction.

Never encountered such unprofessionalism even in much more complex and busy airports.

Otherwise it's a beautiful airport and easy access below Class Bravo LAX airspace.<//Text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x80dd2bb131935449:0x71ee12fadd5c1066<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

This is the guard station in front of the house.
There are many private helicopters here because there are a lot of rich people.
It is very noisy from morning to late at night. But during Corona, the emergency room helicopter
I've seen it often.
It is also a very helpful place.
We will update more information again.

이곳은 집앞 경비행장입니다.
부자들이 많은지 이곳에 개인 helicopter 가 많습니다.
아침부터 늦은밤까지 매우시끄럽습니다.하지만 코로나때 응급실helicopter
를 자주본적이있었습니다.
매우 도움이되는곳이기도 합니다.
더 많은 정보를 또 Update 하겠습니다.

<Text>Well the initial phone call are very well handled. But the follow up is very poor. It makes you feel uncomfortable to call and explain the situation to start. And since most of us don't deal with attorneys we feel pretty embarrassed to ask if we have a case. Not only did they not take the time to call back and tell you the truth about what there decision is they don't care to take just any case. I guess if its not worth big money they wont help you. They are happy to refer you to another place but if the case don't have much Merritt its not worth there time. Sorry but they don't fight for the little people. In this case a young girl. I wish they would have just said the truth and call back and say no.< /Text>< pictures>

I could not be happier, thanks to Law offices of Mickey Fine. They helped me with every situation, and have helped me settle right. Compensating me for all of my medical treatment and the tragedy of losing a vehicle. Michael Chen, Tess Mchugh and Alyssa Garcia are the best. They were incredible, personable and always available no matter how many questions I have. Especially to Michael Chen I thank him so much for settling my case for much more than what I imagined.

I hope I never need another lawyer, but if I do, I know Law office of Mickey Fine is the one I will call. They are trustworthy and honest people. I would recommend this law firm to all my friends and family. Thanks Alyssa Garcia for recommending me the best Law Office in town.<//Text>

We dealt with Michael Chen the majority of the time and he was absolutely wonderful to work with. Michael’s responsiveness in assisting us and his patience in handling our concerns/questions, just going above and beyond to make sure we are satisfied and understood everything that was happening step by step. Great Law Firm and would recommend a hundred times over for anyone looking for their services.</Review>< Name>

I absolutely have to give Mr. Fine and his team five stars but I really wish I could give them more. When I first went to Mr. Fine, I was a little apprehensive regarding getting representation and I was worried that it wouldn't be a personal experience that best represented my needs and concerns. This could not have been farther from the truth! Mr. Fine and his team where available anytime, night and day, throughout the entire process, for any and all questions or concerns that I had. They made sure that all of the support I needed was available from the first day. Honesty, integrity, compassion, and being made a priority are not usually what I have heard about when I spoke to people talk about their experience with an attorney, but I got all of that and more with Mr. Fine and his team. Thank you all for everything you did for me and my family.< /Review>

<Review>I am extremely pleased with the staff at the Law Offices of Mickey Fine and how they handled my case from beginning to end. I was immediately contacted by Tess who was always very responsive and kept in touch with me throughout the entire journey. They provided quick attention to all my medical concerns and immediately referred me when I needed medical attention. Michael helped to close out the case and I appreciated his hard work with exceeding the amount I had initially requested. The entire process was excellent and I will recommend them to anyone looking for an attorney that provides full transparency from beginning to end. Thank you Tess and Michael!</Review><pics>None<//pics><Response>{'time': 1597853801623, 'text': 'Leticia, we are so happy to have gotten to work with you.

<Rate>1< /Rate><Text>When we first signed up with this Attorney, his investigator came to my sons bedside while he was in the hospital (heavily medicated with broken bones) and told us that this was a “slam dunk” case as he asked for my sons signature. Fast forward 10 months later and we have only heard from this law firm because we have reached out inquiring about our case. The attorney is very good about apologizing for lack of initiative. Twice he’s apologized but still nothing different. The last call he stated he would actually look over the case (which tells me he didn’t) and call me Friday. It’s now 4 days after Friday and no call. Looking for another attorney that’s willing to fight for what’s right, not just what might come easy. Note: the attorney called me immediately after I posted a negative review last time to ask me to remove it apologizing, which I did and regret!!< /Text>< Time>

<Review>I got in a car accident earlier this year and a month later I called Mickey Fine's law firm and they took my case. I spent 4 or 5 months going to 3 different doctor's. Mickey Fine and his team takes care of their the people they help. I would come back if I ever get into a car accident again. My case settled within 6 or 7 months and I am happy with the outcome. I would recommend this Law firm to people that suffered from a car accident.<//Review>< pics>

This Law office has it’s professional team in place to assist. Some are retired law enforcement office who have better understanding of your explanation of the accident. Profesional Doctors, chiropractors and therapist are in place to assist.

My elderly father’s car was rear ended and he received excellent service from Micky’s Law office. They made sure that my father was in the same shape as before the accident prior to making final commitment of making the final payment for pain and suffering. It was a year long process but my father received excellent care and compensation in five figures. It was surprising to us.

I would recommend Law Offices of Mickey to anyone in need including my father and friends.

PS: My father received his check 3 weeks ago and was very satisfied with the service.</text>

I was in a horrible car accident where the other driver ran a red light, my nephew said call Mickey Fine, when I was in the hospital!, I did and they were more than helpful in helping resolve my every need.  Any question I had regarding the whole process was immediately answered.  I am always able to speak with Mickey, Michael and Tess they are great. I didn't have to worry about medical expenses because they handled it all including surgeries that I needed.  I am so grateful for Mickey and his staff for all their hard work to get me the settlement they did for what I had to endure. Because of Mickey and his team I am able to buy my dream home.  I highly recommend using them.< /text>

Yes it's going to be a rear end hit if she turns in front of me! Why didn't Mickey's team get the cameras from the intersection and they could have seen the accident, but no it was my word, "young black female" against hers!

<text>I was involved in a accident in 2017, I was rear ended by a tractor trailer in Long Beach CA. A friend refer me to Law Offices of Mickey Fine, he told me don’t worry about anything he’s going to take care of you. The following day I gave Mickey a call to scheduled an appointment, my friend was right. Any time you need anything they’re just a text away, they make you feel like family. If you need to talk to Mickey either he answers right away or with in minutes he’ll return the call. My experience was awesome, his priority was getting me healthy and back on my feet. If I could give them 10 stars I would. Tess was really helpful with all my questions , and concerns. I recommend anybody going through any accidents the Law Offices of Mikey Fine.</text>< pics>

I never thought I would have to get a lawyer in my life, until I was in a vehicle accident over a year ago and I felt like I was loosing all hope on ever getting my injuries properly examined by a doctor after I was turned away by serveral medical offices when hearing the words 'vehicle accident'. I felt like I would have to deal with the pain forever until my injuries healed on their own. I am truly glad that I went with the Law Offices of Mickey Fine because they jumped right into action and set up an appointment for me to be seen and properly examined right away. They restored my hope and when I met with Mickey Fine himself, he explained endless options to my treatment process and answered every question I had.  There are several differnt options of treatment that will help your injuries. They are there for you and will fight to get you what you deserve. So I highly suggest this law office! No need to keep looking any furth because they are the best!</Text><Rate>5< /Rate>< pics>

I have nothing but great things to say about this Law Firm. They were professional, communicative and overly generous with their time.  The process can be a little intimidating so having experienced and willing attorneys representing you is very important.  Mikey  Fine and my case manager Tess Mchugh not only reached a great settlement on my behalf, they also instill confidence through the entire process. I highly recommend them.< /Text>

I called the Law Offices of Mickey Fine after I was hit by a car while coming home from work. I had to be rushed off to the hospital and I was really worried. After I was released I thought about handled the issue alone. But after enough research I found out that it wasn’t a good idea. So I started to look around for personal injury lawyers and I found their office due to the great reviews. I spoke to Tess initially and she reassured me that they could handle it. They came to me so I wouldn’t have to drive around while injured, and so I could sign the paperwork to get started with the process. They told me step by step what I should do (as well as not do) while the case was being handled. Mickey Fine called me in and met with me himself. He was very reassuring in a very troubling time. From then on, if I had any questions, I could call Michael and he would give me all the information I needed, as well as taking the time to listen to my concerns. They made sure I got the help I needed to heal and fought hard for me. I’d like to thank them from the bottom of my heart. I highly recommend them to anyone in need!<//text>

<Review>The paralegals in the office are outstanding. They respond to everything (even the dumb questions). What I love about this law firm is their attention to detail. They have so many clients but they reach out when I forget to sign paperwork.

Everyone in the office has been very helpful in my case. I switched from another attorney because I wasn't about to talk to a lawyer but with these guys, I called and set up an appointment just like that.

<Review>My experienced in this car accident wasn’t a pleasant one but through the aid of the law office of Atty Mickey Fine ... this dreadful experience became as much as easier as can be. I entrust them the process of securing the right settlement me and my mom are entitled for and in the right time we benefit the fruit of their labor. It is worth the wait. Indeed,  it become a blessing in this covid quarantine period of time.

I would highly recommend taking advantage of the professional service of Atty Mickey Fine with his paralegal Partner Ms Tess Mchugh in regards to car accident settlements. I have no recollection of time that my questions were unanswered. Ms Tess Mchugh, her paralegal had much provided not only her expertise in making sure our needs were met during the waiting period...her friendship and encouragement was always there that touches my heart more  than money itself. When we received our settlement.. it is more than what I had asked for. This was my second accident, my first one was a great claim but far more better today... Phenomenal....I just can’t thank enough how we are being helped much even in ways we had not met personally but just through phone but it will forever be a memory that I will pass to my friends, family and my trauma patients that I take care every week... and will continually share this blessing to others that need help how to obtain the best settlement as can be and I hope that by sharing this review it will also reach those people who are looking for a car accident lawyer to whom  they can entrust their case.

I am BLESSED beyond measure,

I was involved on a roll over crash and I called Mickey Fine. From the start Mickey Fine was great. He referred me to the doctor and from there I started getting proper treatment. All the doctors involved were great, very professional and courteous. I has Tess follow up with me and check up on me for the time of the treatment. All my doctor visits were always set up and got me in on time. I was really happy with the outcome of the whole process. Would highly recommend Mickey Fine to anyone.< /review>

Mickey Fine and his staff did a great job in assisting my family and I after our car accident. The insurance was offering me a low amount of money and Mickey Fine was able to get double that amount! I'm so happy because of him and would recommend him to anyone who needs an attorney for personal injury.< /Review>

Staff at Law offices of Mickey Fine were all helpful committed and dedicated to my case. They connected me with physicians that treated me without paying anything upfront and received treatment immediately. I would call Mickey Fine again and will highly recommend the Law Offices of Mickey Fine to my friends and family members.</review>

<text>A year ago on June 1st, I was involved in an accident where a lady had ran a stop sign and t boned me and tried to deny that it was her fault therefore attempting to put the blame on me. I called Mickey Fine a few days after the accident, and they sent over someone to talk to me within another day, I was getting sent to doctors for my injuries and things were actually getting done. They were such a big help and I am very thankful for them. Tess was very nice, always answering back whenever I had questions about anything and everything, the whole team are just very good at what they do.</text>< pics>

When I got in my accident I didn’t know what to do and my friend told me about Mickey and I was so glad I meet him he is one of the best lawyers in town I’ve had fair share of others and being that I found Mickey I was glad. He is down to earth and everyone I mean everyone that works for him to Micheal to Tess to Yolanda to the front desk lady’s there all so helpful and nice. Also they do everything for you, you don’t have to do nothing you can call them as many times as you want and they don’t  get upset. They are for US NOT FOR THEM I MEAN FOR US! They will get you as much as they can and not want all the money! So please use them you will be happy and so grateful! Put it this way I’m sad to have my case over just cause they are so amazing! Don’t get me wrong I’m happy it’s over just sad to have to be done with great people!<//review>

<Review>I had the pleasure to retain Mr. Fine and all his resources to get my case resloved.   Mr. Fines Office worked with me and helped me during some unforeseen circumstances that happened in my life. when I say his resources I mean he uses alot of contacts and professional people that are good at what they do to get my case resolved.  It doesn't matter how large or small your case is, he treats them all the same. What I thought was real professional about Mr. Fine was him taking time away from his family to personally take my call and to meet me and my wife.  He didn't send a paralegal to meet us or a partner in his firm that how much her cares about the clients he takes. When your hire Mickey Fine You get EVERYTHING HE HAS TO OFFER.  BTW his assistant Tess, I don't think she ever stops working. She responds to emails at night during weekend , holidays. She is truly an amazing person

I had an excellent experience with the Law Offices of Mickey Fine. We're always there to answer any of questions and referred me to the best doctors to get my care. I always felt safe and that I was in good hands they went above and beyond when it came to customer service. Thanks to Mickey and his staff I feel a lot better. Highly recommend Law Offices of Mickey Fine.<//Review>

<text>In November of 2015, I was in a car accident.  The other car T-boned the vehicle I was in.  I decided to contact the Law Offices of Mickey Fine after speaking to the car insurance carriers who did not have my best interest at making sure I got the proper medical care I deserved.  The Law Offices of Mickey Fine made sure I was properly taken care of and got the best medical treatment.  Along the way, his team made all the medical appointments I needed and followed up with my progress on a weekly basis.   Furthermore, his team persisted that I focus on getting well while they will deal with the insurance companies. I highly recommend the Law Office of Mickey Fine to be on your side.</text><UserId.>109981383718392731347</UserId.><time>1459712731600<//time><pictures>None<//pictures>< name>

<Time>1476484837516< /Time><Text>After my car accident, the insurance company of the person at fault tried to shift the blame to me. In fact I was blamed just because they (the insurance company) don't want to pay. When I got MICKEY FINE in the playing field, there was hope in the horizon. Although it took sometime, but Mickey Fine took positive and prompt steps to get me my deserved settlement. While Mickey Fine got me a pretty good payout, he ensured that medical bills from the accident were drastically reduced. One Mickey Fine staff you want to hold on to is TESS MCHUGH. Tess knows her job pretty damn good, and will treat you as her own. Am still thankful to Mickey for a job very well done. My name is Samson.</Text>< username>

My experience with Mickey and his staff was exceptional.  I never had to worry about anything.  They always checked on me and made sure I received all the care I needed after my accident.  Anytime I had a question or needed anything they were prompt at getting me my appt or information I needed.  If you ever need a lawyer I recommend for you to call especially if you have never had one or understand the process they make it easy and understandable and tell you everything upfront.</Review>

After first taking our case to another so-called, "Fighter for the people", we went to Mickey Fine's office. It took Mickey, and his group just over one year to get the insurance company to agree on a settlement for my wife's injuries. We nearly passed out when they told us the amount of the settlement.
Mickey, we will be forever grateful to you and your associates for your hard work, and dedication. Thanks to you, my wife is now the proud owner of her dream home.
With our Sincerest Gratitude,
Carlos and Michelle Arredondo</Text>

I was fortunate to work with Mr. Fine and his staff after my car accident. Mr. Fine and his staff were very patient and dedicated to my case, which almost took two years. They were always there to answer any questions I had and made sure I received the care I deserved. They took care of all my medical bills, collection agencies, court dates, etc. He worked diligently and refused to quit even when things got complicated. He got me exponentials results from my case and I am very pleased with the outcome. I would highly recommend himself and his team.<//Text>

I was the victim of a hit-and-run back in July 2016. As many have experienced, my insurance company said they would not be paying for my injuries. Mickey Fine and his legal team picked up my case the very next day and immediately got me the medical care I needed through their doctors and also got me the compensation I deserve for my pain and suffering. My advice to anyone looking for legal representation is pick up the phone and call Mickey Fine’s office today. Don’t sit around waiting for a response from the insurance companies. They have the experience and knowledge needed to handle these cases. Believe me they will take care of your every need!</Text>

Mickey Fine did a great job on taking the stress out of handling the accident aftermath and injuries.  I was able to focus on getting better and receiving the right medical treatment.  I'm not 100% and likely won't be, which made working with a professional law office all that much more necessary.  Their office kept me informed and assisted in setting up getting the right diagnostics and treatments.  I have recommended Mickey Fine to others and will continue to do so.  You couldn't find a better team of professionals to work with.  Thank you, Mickey, Tess, and everyone!  If you need an attorney, give his office a call....You won't be sorry.< /review>

<Review>I was hit by a big metal trailer that this man was pulling with his truck and he said I hit him. I had a witness that saw the accident and she came forward to help me. It was clearly this man's fault, but he fought it and had a terrible insurance company so I had to hire Mickey Fine to represent me and get my case settled. I got my car fixed with genuine GM parts, went to therapy, got my granddaughter's car seat replaced. Everyone at Mickey Fine's office was very helpful and informative. I respect Mickey and his employees and trust them. I am happy to say my case is now settled. Working with Mickey Fine's firm was an easy and wonderful process. I highly recommend this Law Firm to anyone that needs help with their legal matters.<//Review>< pictures>

<review>Its almost impossible to find a commercial that is real.
After speaking with Mr Fine and his staff, I found them to be even more real .My experiences with mickey and his staff has been more of a conversation with a family member that vows to help in anyways possible. They cared!!
As a result, after being out of work for over a year, I will still be able to financially support my kids off to college in a few weeks and peruse the startup of my own business.
You guys have earned my trust and, most importantly, my respect.
THANKS FOR CARING MORE THAN YOU HAD TO!!!< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

< Review>
I had a wonderful experience with Mickey and Tess. Tess helped me every step of the way. Answered all texts, calls and emails no matter the time or excessiveness. I had no idea how to handle something like this because I have never been in an accident or had any kind of legal issue. They got me the best deal possible and in great timing. Also, the doctors they sent me to were very helpful and relieved my pain as best as one could with the issues I experienced after the accident. I would definitely recommend Mickey Fine to anyone that has an accident and needs help. Tess will always answer and explain things in a way you can understand and help you with all paper work along the way. Thank you, Tess and Mickey!</Review>

<review>My husband and I were rear ended at a stop light.  We were both pretty shaken up and didn't know own what to do.  A good friend who is more like family told us to call Mickey.  I filled out the consultation form online on a Friday night at around 8:45 pm.  I figured someone would call me Monday.  Imagine my surprise when Mickey himself called me a few minutes later.  I was floored.  He was so warm and kind.  He reassured me everything would be ok.  The next day we hired him.  Eli came to our house and he was just as sweet as Mickey.  He also assured us all would be fine.  Then Tess began calling.  She is the sweetest, most wonderful lady.  My husband and I truly think the world of her.  She set us up with doctors to help us get better.  Tess and Mickey stood by us throughout the entire process and we couldn't have been happier.  They turned a stressful situation into a tolerable one.  We HIGHLY recommend Mickey Fine and his entire staff for any personal injury needs.</review>< pictures>

I was injured in a car accident that was not my fault. I was getting nowhere with my insurance.  I looked online for an attorney and found Mickey fine and I was glad I did.  I met with Mickey he listen to me and told me to call his office and speak to Tess in the morning.  Tess setup all my appointments to get me back on track.  They were there if I had any questions  all I had to do is call .  I would like to thank Mickey , Michael and all the staff for working hard for me.< /Text>

<user_id>115444710357497728889< /user_id><Review>Hi my name is Sonya. I am writing this review because I am grateful and would like to take a moment to thank The Law Offices of Mickey Fine for their service. I could never thank them enough for all they have done for me. But, I would like to let everyone know how they helped me and why I am so thankful.
I was involved in a automobile accident with my sister. My sister was the driver and I was the passenger in my sister car. Another driver ran into the back of the automobile we were in. Me and my sister sustain injuries. Same accident, both of sustain injuries, only difference we had was we choose different attorneys to represent us. My sister choose a local attorney near her in Stockton, CA. I choose The Law Offices Of Mickey Fine. To make a long story short, Mickey Fine and Tess got me the best medical attention I could have asked for, for as long as I needed it. They made sure they took care of all my needs and wants. Tess updated regularly on my case and kept me informed and explained to what was going on. I could text them any time of the day or night and I always got a immediate response. My sister's attorney did not address her medical needs as she expected and settled her case without at trying to get her compensated for her lost wages when she had to miss work because of the accident. My sister still complains of pain. When me and my sister had a conversation about our cases and how they turned out, we both learned that I made the best choice of attorney by chosing The Law Offices of Mickey Fine. Some of the reasons we felt my choice of attorney  was better 1.) I didn't have to pay any up-front expenses. 2.) They provided my with the best doctors and the best care for me. 3.) They arrange for help with help for prescriptions, etc. 4.) They were always available to answer my questions and concerns. 5.) They always kept me up-dated and informed about what was going with my case regularly.6.) I felt I could trust The Law Offices of Mickey Fine, and I was RIGHT!!!! The Law Offices of Mickey Fine got me a financial compensation 9 times more than what my sister attorney got her. The scenario of my story is, I know it's hard to find a good injury attorney that you can trust to keep your best interest in mind and do their best to help you as much as they can. My sister regrets not making the same choice I did.I hope my review will help as much people as possible know I recommend The Law Offices Of Mickey Fine. Their service phenomenal and exceeds expectations. If you are anyone you know need a injury attorney, please don't hesitate to contact Mickey Fine"s office. Trust me, after talking to Tess or any of the others you will understand choosing them is the " RIGHT " choice without a doubt. My sister still regrets not choosing Mickey Fine, now she has to live with being in pain because her attorney didn't get her the medical attention she still needs today. She has to pay out of pocket expenses.</Review>< Response>

From the beginning (within days of being hit by another driver), while recovering from a major concussion with loss of memory, Mickey Fine's staff guided me through rough waters. His investigator arranged all initial meetings and paperwork. His staff, specifically Mrs. McHugh were phenomenal about responding to all questions promptly. I have never waited a full day for a reply to any question. They did not fit the perception I had of a lawyer at any point. I assumed it would be difficult to get their time and attention without appointments, but they even went as far as to invite me to the offices on multiple occasions so that I could see their team working for me and not just be a name on an email string.

Even with partial amnesia for two weeks after the accident and long term degradation of memory processing, Mr. Fine's offices were having a hard time displaying to the insurance companies that I had a significant injury.  They never waivered from aggressively and diligently representing me.  They took the load of pursuing what I could not have on my behalf, and remained steadfast for nearly 2 years until it was resolved and settled. I would have given up doing it myself in the first year, I just have never seen such dedicated focus...it was as if I was treated as their only client, even though they had plenty of clients that they were representing.

I have and will continue to recommend Mickey Fine and his staff to anyone who is in need of representation.  They are a top notch organization.

The Law Offices of Mickey Fine answered all my questions and he took the time to help me even though another attorney's  office was already handling my case during that time.  Next time I need a personal injury attorney, I will definitely go to the Law Offices of Mickey Fine.</Text>

< review>
Very bad service. Never once got a phone call from them in two weeks. I had gotten all the information myself about my accident, they're "investigator" which is another story in itself was no help at all, had such a bad attitude I almost walked away. Very bad service, they're commercial gives them too much credit. They did not care about my case, only when I called them to ask about it did they get to work...terrible customer service they don't let you talk. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS LAWYER.</review>

<Review>One of the best decision that my husband and I made was to hire Mickey Fine.  My husband needed medical care after his accident, and he was able to get all the treament needed to get him out of pain.   The great staff at  Mickey Fine's office handled everything to make it a very smooth,  and easy process.  I would highly recomend the Law Offices of Mickey Fine.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Mikey Fines office is great! I was involved in a car wreck a year ago and his team worked hard to get me the health care I needed and the money I deserved! When I had lost hope in ever getting anything because the other party didnt have coverage! Mikeys Fines office surprised me! My bills are paid and I have money in my pocket! Thanks guys for all your love and support<//Review>

<Review>My name is Michael Cheek. I got hit by an incoming car. Going through the er was difficult and painful. I knew I needed help paying for future medical and expenses. So I called Mickey Fine, and he had an investigator there at rhe rehab  helping me through this difficult time where he gave me hope and a future to where I have no worries now. I met up personally with Micky Fine and my first impression was how impressive he was with the knowledge of what was going on. I could also seehow he cares about my health above all. We also made a friendship. So I would recommend Mickey Fine for any body in this position.<//Review>< Pictures>

<GmapID>0x80ea69f72a9fda5f:0xc296d994026c54ec</GmapID><Text>In October of 2014, I was involved in a motor vehicle accident in which i was severly injured and required immediate hospitalization. Two weeks out of the Hospital, I googled personal injury lawyer and came across The Law Offices of Mickey Fine. I recognized his name from the Rener Gracie commerial(UFC fan) and decided to call his office asking for help. Mickey told me to focus on healing and he would take care of the rest. Now February 2016, after multiple surgeries, I am here to recommend Mickey Fine to anyone that is in need of a personal injury lawyer. He was never more than a phone call away when i needed to speak with him which was always only to calm my nerves. I was the one who had not been in this situation before. This man knows what he is doing and he does it with a sage-like demeanor. I could not be happier with my decision to retain his services and the subsequent outcome of my case. He went above and beyond what i had expected and I'm more than satisfied with the results he provided. Once again if you are in need of a personal injury lawyer, I highly recommend you give The Law Offices of Mickey Fine a call-Mike H<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< username>

<Review>You may think Mickey Fine is just some auto lawyer with all these fancy commercials, a cool number like 333-3333, or an old guy who wants to be your lawyer because he's old . Whatever your thoughts might be about Mickey Fine if your in a car accident you'd be "crushed" not to call him lol . In all seriousness , you should "fine" out for yourself The Law offices of Mickey Fine is the best .  Mickey Fine is the best !!! I can now look back with tears of Joy and relief instead of pain and hope because Mickey fine is a man of his actions and greater actions speak louder than good words. When I was in a car accident, due to I was hit by a drunk driver ,I thought my life was over. I was injured pretty bad and when reality set in that this really happen to me I broke down and was hurt to the core. I knew I wasn't  going to be able to continue working, take my 3 year old babygirl to preschool , or continue going to church every sunday mornings and wednesday nights on my own.  Mickey fine and his exceptional team committed to ensuring the quality of my care. I can honestly say I was in good hands and had absolutely nothing to worry about when Mickey and his team came into my life. This team checked on me more than my own family and friends through it all, updated me on all information nessecery ,answered any questions that I had  to the best of abilities , was honest , true  and most importantly they left me worry free .Time flys when your being taken care off. Mickey contributed more than his legal talents , but a true heart for my health and well being and yes of course got me a great settlement. Thank you Mickey Fine for absolutely everything !!!!  I pray many blessings upon your law firms and that more people like me in need come to a great person and team like you  !</Review>< pics>

This place is rediculous. First, You cant deposit cash into someones account. You have to get a money order. They don't tell you at the time they wont search for the account for you either. I have been to many banks and as long as you have the account holders name and sometimes the birthday they will find the account as long as its just a deposit.  So I lost $20 because they wouldn't deposit the money order for me. This bank had also tried to say I owed them $200+ dollars after my account was closed for a couple months. Which was fixed after I called corporate but still. Word of advise, Go to a different bank or better yet a credit union. Wells fargo is a fraud. Don't forget they created accounts in a bunch of peoples names fraudulently a while back. Glad I got out of there when I did.< /Text>

<text>10 days ago I used the Wells Fargo Bank ATM on Union in Manteca.  In my withdrawal was half of a. $50 bill.  I tried using it at stores but nobody would accept it. I went to the bank branch in Stockton and they wouldn't accept it.  They told me that it was a Manteca branch problem and that I needed to send the half  $50 bill to the Treasury Dept at a cost of approximately $15 with a 4-6 week waiting time.  If Wells Fargo thought that the$50 bill was good enough to put it into circulation, why wouldn't they exchange it for me at the bank?  It's going to cost me  $70 for my  $50 bill.  Is that fair?< /text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>{'time': 1598470155079, 'text': "Hi, Frank. Your review caught my attention, and I will have the appropriate team look into what happened.

I'm a big fan of Wells Fargo, been banking here for years but this location is HORRIBLE.  Lines are so long I feel like I'm at DMV or the welfare office. I'm here in line now 20 minutes still 4 people ahead of me. Looked it up online to possibly write a review and seen there is one bad review after another. So here's mine. Hopefully corporate office will read these and make some changes.< /text>

<Review>To begin I've never opened an account with Wells Fargo. My problem with this bank began in May of last year 2016. When I received a collection notice for an over draft of $215 on an account which Wells Fargo claimed I opened. After I had talked to the collection agency who then connected me with Wells Fargo's collection department. Now I want to inform you the general public that Wells Fargo has been accused of fraud & unethical customer conduct. I being a victim of this banks unethical conduct. Case in point, I walked into the Wells Fargo branch at 303 N. El Dorado st in September of 2016 here in Stockton. I was cooperative in everything they asked of me to resolve my issue. I provided the bank with the documentation the bank asked of me, signed, & had paper work notarized at this branch, yet the banks collection & claims departments are separate departments. Both of which are negligent & incompetent. At this point in time a year later. I'm still being pestered by Wells Fargo's claims department because according to them there collections department has yet to receive all proper documentation to resolve my case. Word of advice do not trust your money to such inept business practices. It is no wonder why to me this bank has been accused of fraud & unethical customer conduct.< /Review></record>

<review>Very poor service . 4 yelled waiting on 50 plus customers . If i they give negative stars I would . They was multiple other employees walking around doing nothing . I wish I could load up a picture so it could be seen . Everyone on staff should be trained to be a teller so they can assist where customers are needed . They are more intersted in getting new accounts than giving support to the customers they already have . I will never use this branch ever or refer anyone to it . If your retired or have nothing to do this is the place . For those we have busy lives . It's annoying .<//review></record>

This Resturant always serves great food and if for some reason it’s not what you wanted they replace the item hassle free!! Very nice guest service hosts/hostesses that definitely make you want to go back for more!! It’s hard to find great food anymore! Thanks Jose’s!!!< /Text>

My favorite has always been the asada burritos but today it was not as good as always
The burritos had almost no meat it was all filled with beans and rice
Not coming back for a very long time<//Text>

Great, authentic tasting Mexican food. Their Carne Asada, Shrimp and rice is my favorite. The margaritas are strong and the Coronaritas (in the pic) are a hit!< /text>

I love Mexican food so I'll eat it every chance I get. But this place is really shady. My girlfriend wasn't very hungry so she decided to get something small from the kids menu. The lady flat out said no cause she's not 10. Then proceeded to have an attitude with the rest of the party. Wont be returning< /Text>

< Review>
I visited Jose's Mexican food on Thursday November 16th 2017 and as always I was greeted with a warm reception by the manager and servers. I decided to try a new food item on the menu called California fries and as soon as I took my first bite it took me into French fry heaven. The musical setting is quite invigorating and suits the Mexican setting very well as well the detailed decorations. The server was courteous and attentive and ensured me and my partner had our expectations met. The food is excellent as well as the service and food choices will blow your mind. Please try out this wonderful Mexican restaurant,  I highly recommend it.</Review>

Insanely small tacos. Too expensive for the "Traditional Taco Platter" with tiny tortillas. Good environment to say the least. If it wasn't for hunger, I would of waited to get to the Imperial Valley to get twice the food for the same price as Jose Mexican Food.< /review>

I was very impressed with the food the first time I came here. The food is delicious, family welcoming, you can even serve yourself with nachos and salsa. It's overpriced though.</text>

Their food is really delicious. We ordered our food for curbside pickup and it went without any problems. The California Taco with Chicken is my favorite.<//review>

Worst place ever! Ordered over the phone and they got my whole order wrong! Than when we called the lady had a super bad attitude because of their mess up. Than when we brought the food back to get the correct order she refused to give her name and again gave horrible attitude and blamed me for her mistake. I will never again come here. Not to mention the food was nothing more than mediocre. Don't waste your time and money.<//Text>

Jose's Mexican food is a great local place! You can get a beer on tap or by the bottle I don't believe they have a bar but they do sell beer and wine. It's always clean the menu is simple but fresh. They have a salsa bar with fresh made tortilla chips and his self serve which is always nice if you're hungry. You do have to go to the counter to order but when your orders ready they'll bring it to your table side. The last time I went I have the chili colorado burrito which was bigger than it looked and in hindsight I should have took half of it home but I couldn't help myself and it all right there.</Review>

I had ordered a bean and cheese burrito for my Mom with extra cheese and NO rice, well they put rice in it anyways!! I told the guy 2 times and they still got it wrong!! My Mom was so mad because this is not the first time this has happened!! Actually it is the 3rd time they did this!! We eat here at least 4 or 5 times a month and I feel they should pay more attention to the customers orders when they prepare them!!<//Text>

Disappointed ☹️ . I got 2 burritos and an order of Cali fries all for close to $40. My least  favorite were the fries. I thought the food was going to be better. I gave it some stars because the place was clean.< /Text>

—1. Had tacos salads to go. No beans or cheese just a lot of lettuce.   Don’t think I will go back.  I could go to Del taco an get a better meal.   More I think about it I want money back.  These people want $15.00 hour. An can even make an order right. I would give the a -10.  Don’t go there</Text>

<review>What can I say about this establishment. Is a nice place to have lunch or dinner with your family. Food is prepared very well and season to taste. The $5 Margaritas are larger than expected for the price and very tasty indeed. Though the place is a little dark for my liking. But it is great if you are taking someone on a nice romantic dinner. Highly recommended on such occasion.<//review>< rate>

Insulting to reply; "are you sire it was our jose's" I said I had an interview at YOUR location, the manager looked at me a few times and looked annoyed by me being there..I was even their before the boy he knew showed up. I was 15 minutes early and have more experience. (I know this because I overheard him say he had nevet worked in food before. You may say you dont want to make others feel u comfortable. The fact of the matter is; you do and already did make me and others feel this way. But dont just focus on that. I stand by what I stated about ur mediocre food being over priced and tallboys at nearly $7. Wow.

Over priced, food is meh..salsa bar always has un attended children making a mess and $6/7 dollar tallboys lol and you kidding me? Owner isnt pleasant at all...especially since he IGNORED ME when I had a scheduled interview and he paid attention to a friend of the families who applied and had zero food experience, while I have years and I managed a deli...go figure.< /review>< Pics>

Don't be fooled by the fast food style take out counter that greets you when you walk in.  This place is the real deal. Everything you want and expect at a mexican restaurant. Jarrito soda and many Mexican beers in the help yourself cooler. Jamaica, horchata, and soda on tap for self serve. 6 salsas, jalapeños, yellow chillis, and chips all at the condiment bar. Great pecasado mojarra with charro beans and rice. Comes with avacado and Pico de gallo. Very diverse menu, great friendly service, the restaurant has a great concept.< /text>

Had the all day $5.00 chicken burrito it tasted pretty good will most definitely go back and try something new. Also the chip and salsa bar is a big plus along with the different variety of soda and fresh waters awesome i gotta say. The customer service is great as well. 5 stars..< /Text>

I  love the food and the new menu items

Good portions for the price usually fast service when it’s not busy . Starting to get popular. They have fresh flour tortillas salsas chips with your order I can eat the chips all day 😋 they have out door seating  and t.vs for the big game.  Check it out

Oh they also have rewards the more you dine you get free meal punch card but I heard there changing Which I’m disappointed ☹️ but we’ll see .

The place needs a deep cleaning how ever!</Review>

<Review>I dine here on a few occasions and I have not had a bad meal. Today however I was not pleased. I ordered a lengua buritto, I order it without rice (I don't care for it much), so what I got was a bean burrito with a few chucks of lengua. It was disapointing.</Review>< user>

<text>Went there for the Menudo.. It tasted watered down and i was there at 10am
The server brought the condiments for the dish and the chili flake bottle looked like it was washed a year ago . i should it to the server and of course he didn't notice..
Over all it was lame..

Jose's Mexican food is a great local place! You can get a beer on tap or by the bottle I don't believe they have a bar but they do sell beer and wine. It's always clean the menu is simple but fresh. They have a salsa bar with fresh made tortilla chips and his self serve which is always nice if you're hungry. You do have to go to the counter to order but when your orders ready they'll bring it to your table side. The last time I went I have the chili colorado burrito which was bigger than it looked and in hindsight I should have took half of it home but I couldn't help myself and it all right there.< /text>

<text>We’ve been a dedicated customer for 19 years until today. Their food and service has gone down hill. Ordered 2 Dinners to take out which was The Taquito Platter. My Husband brought them home and opened up the box there was only 1 Teaspoon of Guacamole for 3 Taquitos. Are you kidding me? They had it mixed in with cut up romaine lettuce and the Beans were old and dry. So disappointed. This place is really bad now. Never again will we eat there again. They will definitely go out of business serving food like this and I hope they do!!!< /text><user_id>100918178881171525404< /user_id><Pics>None</Pics><response>{'time': 1568162343963, 'text': "Oh my goodness...

I am a long time customer, but i have never place phone order. today i did big mistake. I got back to work the cup that was supposed to be shrimp cocktail and got a cup of tomato sauce.  Since i am at work i have no time to go back so now i have no lunch today and the management does not care. They have had employees come to my office and deliver chips and salsa in attempts to get new business but can use those same  to bring me lunch..This will make me not to ever come back to this place again. then im given a number to text my complaint..I cannot talk to a person<//review>

Had a good meal here the other night I got the pueblo burrito with chicken jose style I believe it was called which means it comes wet with pico, guacamole, and sourcream on the side food is fresh and and tasty, a plus with this place is the chips and salsa bar which has a good variety of salsas, I prefer the hot red one. This place is my go to Mexican food date spot.< /text>

This location now has counter service and then brings the order to your table.
I’m not sure if all the other locations do this as well...

Food was good and prices are reasonable. They have a chips and salsa bar, unlimited. I believe they had three different types of salsa, maybe four.... I wasn’t the person responsible for getting these haha

I’d come again, and will probably become a regular if the consistency is solid.

Area around was clean outside and inside everything was clean and pleasant.<//text>< Gmap_id>

<Text>It was alright, but I have definitely had better. Very friendly staff, and the atmosphere is nice enough...but as far as Mexican Food is concerned it was just so so. My son said the bathroom was really dirty, but I didn't see the facilities personally.< /Text>< pictures>

<review>Although I prefer to sit at a table, peruse the menu, and then give my order to waitstaff; at Jose's you order as soon as you enter. I gives a feeling of being rushed. The food almost makes up for this anomaly. The food is truly great, and the menu extensive. I recommend highly.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>{'time': 1560784849051, 'text': 'Im soo glad you enjoyed the food.

Always the best customer service when you order. The food is made fresh and it's brought to your table promptly. But, do take some chips and salsa from the bar. It's always well stocked with two trays of chips and lots of salsa from hot to mild and jalapenos and lemon slices.<//review>

I only give 2 stars because I like the fact they have unlimited chips. I went to try the taco Tuesday to go, we decided to stay in and eat open the box the tacos look all crazy cold tortillas, meat, chicken. I was surprised sense I see the ratings and try to give it a try. They were not fix like the pictures I open my last box to go of chicken tacos 4 to 3 little pieces on them I told the girl she oh ok and took my box bought the same box back rather than the cook or who ever responsible say give some fresh warm tacos they hardly had any cilantro or onions sad... but oh well that what get trying to get tacos Tuesday street tacos and even way better...</text>

<Text>Pretty good.... Not the best or most authentic Mexican food I've ever had. Kids eat free on Wednesday. They need to fix their AC, it was so hot in there. Uncomfortably hot..... They have a little salsa bar, being as crowded as they are, they should probaby have a second salsa bar, had to wait in line to get salsa 😕.  Also, wait time for food was a little excessive. Heard staff arguing in the back, maybe the food would have came sooner if they would be more professional and stop arguing.. ... Other than that, pretty decent food.< /Text>< date>

<text>The food is not that expensive gave it 4 stars. because they dont have much to order from on the "healthy" side of things. But if your not healthy then it is definitely good food for a decent price. Love the salsa bar! The service is good nothing to complain about but you do get your food pretty quickly< /text>< Date>

Quick, friendly service, lots of variety on the menu. Great place for a group; each person orders for himself and pays at the register. No "can you split the check" issues here. Food tastes fresh. The noise level.is very low even when crowded. Various types of beer is available  along with soft drinks. Breakfast is available but I don't think all day. I can't think of a better place for lunch!</text>

Food is average but service was nice and friendly. Carnitas was dry, Al Pastor was lacking taste, and the Asada was good but to thick for a street taco. My sope had beans under it that made it impossible to pick up and eat. Nachos were decent at best. Overall not going back for seconds.<//review>

Their food used to be the bomb. But now I don't agree.  They changed the way they prepare the food and I don't care for it. You may still like it. I ordered a enchilada plate. It had no sauce inside it was cold. The tortill was not cooked and was stiff.
The rice was hard and the beans were dry.<//review>

Pretty good.... Not the best or most authentic Mexican food I've ever had. Kids eat free on Wednesday. They need to fix their AC, it was so hot in there. Uncomfortably hot..... They have a little salsa bar, being as crowded as they are, they should probaby have a second salsa bar, had to wait in line to get salsa 😕.  Also, wait time for food was a little excessive. Heard staff arguing in the back, maybe the food would have came sooner if they would be more professional and stop arguing.. ... Other than that, pretty decent food.</Text>

It had been a while since I had been here, In my opinion it has declined in value. The menu has become hard to read and the food is lacking true flavor, just a bland low quality sauce.<//Text>

Friendly service, warm and welcoming staff. Great selection of Mexican Food.  Chips and Salsa is a must to start and it's complimentary. Soda fountain with crisp and refreshing drinks including Jamaica and Horchata.  Hands down,  you must try their Shrimp Cocktail... it is simply delicious,  leaves you wanting more !!< /review>

I went two different times with coworkers within the same month. I raved about the food to my coworkers telling them I hadn't eaten there in months but I know it was good food. The 1st time when the server brought our food they didnt have my order correct at all. By the time I got my food my friends were just about done. My order STILL wasnt right they didn't give me the eggs that I asked for and they didn't give me the side of tortillas. I didn't complain I just took it to go. The 2nd time I took a coworker for breakfast. I told her the food was very good! But while I was eating I found a hair under my eggs and rice! Grossed me out! As I was pulling the hair from under my food a server walked by and I showed him. He apologized and said he can make me a new one or give me a refund. I said no I want the food I am hungry. It was about 15-20 minutes later I went to use the restroom and seen the server with other employees sitting at a booth. I went to the cashier and asked where my food was and she had no idea that I needed my food still. Since my friend was practically done I asked for a refund. I was so upset! I did eat the free chips and salsa which were very good! When a pregnant woman is hungry she Is Hungry! Sorry that I left a 1 rating the food is really good. But I just got screwed over twice! And I was grossed out by the hair! I know it wasn't mine it was under the food and I had to pull it out from under!< /text>

<review>A little noisier than we like because of a baseball game going on they immediately directed us to a quieter venue and turned down the TV in that room. We ordered very good food (we knew 'cause we'd been here before). My wife ordered the wrong shrimp dish which our wonderful waitress immediately took it back without hesitation and got the one she wanted. What a good experience AND food.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

<text>Solid Tex Mex style Mexican food. They've really improved things over the past few years. Quality and cleanliness have gotten much better. Best part is the chips and salsa bar.< /text><resp>None< /resp>< user>

<Review>This is the third Jose's location I have visited and they have managed to stay consistent. The customer service is friendly, the prices are fair, the food is phenomenal, and the portions are huge. Definitely a great place to grab some authentic Mexican food when moms not around to make some.< /Review>< user>

Ordered a taco salad, then watched as they brought one back from a table.
Back to the the order where the cook took it back from the girl. As I waited for my taco salad. I told the girl,  please make sure I don't get that salad.
When a order it brought back to the counter it should immediately be put in the trash!! Not sent back to the cook!
I'm only 5 minutes from the restaurant
When I got home I felt the chicken and it was stone cold
Leaving me wondering if it was the one returned.  Then proceeded to feed it to my dogs. I honestly feel it could have been the same salad.
I not I'll go back there< /Text>

Only my 2nd time here, myself and 3 kids, didnt buy anything special, a burrito, two orders of carne asada fries, one order shrimp tacos. Cost me $70. Food was decent, but not $70 good. I'll stick to the small taco shops, better food, and definitely cheaper.< /Review>

Order was incorrect, asked for no onions and tacos had onions but no cilantro. Also was charged for carne asada even though we were given chicken. The prices on there online menu are different than what we were charged for entire order. Such a disappointment for mediocre Mexican food. I don't plan to return or refer people to this place.< /Text>

<Rating>2< /Rating><pictures>None<//pictures><Review>Visited this location for lunch on Saturday.  Food preparation was sloppy and sub-standard, and the order was not complete when delivered.  I was never able to track down a waiter to correct the problem.  Dirty tables were left unattended, due to the fact that the restaurant is short-staffed.  (Pay more, and maybe you'll be able to staff up.  Duh.)

The worst part of the experience, however, was the noise.  The music was (and is) so F-ing loud that people cannot think straight, let alone talk over it.  Given the acoustics in the room, loud music bounces around, which exacerbates the effect of the sonic pollution.  Correct this problem, FFS.  Being subjected to jackhammer-loud noise while eating is not a pleasant dining experience.

Bottom line: I won't be back anytime soon.  Lousy food, and far too noisy.  I don't expect these problems to be corrected anytime soon, if ever.</Review></record>

This place is cozy and dim, a bit of a nice touch to the atmosphere. Food gets out to you SUPER fast, which is nice. Staff don't engage too much, and sometimes the chips aren't as fresh under the heat lamp, but it's minor in regards to the tasty food.<//Text>

<Text>The worst food ever cold the cook doesn't know how to even prepare the food. The only exceptional thing was the beer besides that everything was awful I had carne asada tacos they were so cold and flavorless the sauces taste like tap water and my mom's enchiladas were poorly made I will never go to this place again I recommend you go somewhere else<//Text>< Pics>

Food is above average. Likes the fajita burrito and monudo. Only thing I have to complain about is the salsa cups, very small and rounded so it is very easy to spill</Text>

Nice atmosphere friendly people, food is good too. Side note, Beware of the horchata. If it's not homemade it's not good - just my experience.</Text>

Went there today for father's day and it was a mess. I truly regret dropping $100 on such bad customer service. My group consisted of four people. Me, my wife, mom and dad. To start the food took way too long. I had ordered two shrimp cocktails, which you would think those would have been delivered first maybe about 15 minutes into the order. Anyways, my dad gets his food first 30 minutes after ordering. Then about ten minutes later my wife and I get our food and about ten more minutes my mom.  It took about 50 minutes before my mom could get a plate of menudo. Then to top it off my wife's order was wrong so we had to send it back. My food came with tortillas which I never got and quite frankly we had been waiting so long for our food that we got filled with the tortilla chips and salsa.

Now it was busy so I have some sympathy but not much. The bottom line is we are still customers and that should not be an excuse. I've been there once on a regular business day and the service was ok not great ok. So like I said I know the potential for them to give great customer service is their. I feel that management should do a better job of preparing for busy days like this ensuring that they have enough staff and watching everything carefully so that it does not take up to 50 minutes to have someone's food delivered.</review>

Being a frequent customer for over 10 years I have watched the prices go up and the quality go way down,  also the portions have been reduced, the last meal was a crunchy taco and chillie relleno, the taco was all lettuce and relleno was under cooked chillie and burned on the bottom the manager didn't seem to care when I voice my complaint , i been taking my family here for years but sorry to say this would be the last time</Review><date>1481562218900< /date>< user_id>

My husband and I ordered chimichangas and there was maybe a tablespoon of meat in each one. For $10 a piece it should have more meat and less beans and rice. Not very happy.< /Text>
<Pics>None< /Pics><resp>{'time': 1546237494141, 'text': '🙈 Im so sorry we dissappointed.  Chimichangas arent on the menu, its kind of a special order.. I will chat with the team and ask how much meat we are putting in them.  Its difficult, because we do not have a set recipe, so the cook on, kinda makes theyre chimichanga. We will try to find something more consistent. I apologize for the misunderstanding.'}</resp>< gmap_id>
