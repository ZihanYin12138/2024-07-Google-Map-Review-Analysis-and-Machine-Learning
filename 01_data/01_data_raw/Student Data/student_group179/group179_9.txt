This branch is simply amazing!! I've been in Redwood City for three months now and have rented a car every single weekend here. The service is really efficient and high quality. All the staff members I've met are super nice people. Especially I want to mention Mr. Brandon Tirado. He's been servicing me for the past couple weeks. His unbelievably kindness, energy, and positivity, fun conversation, and thoughtfulness makes me can't wait to see him every week. Brandon, thank you so much for your amazing service!!!< /review>

Got a rental from here from insurance when my car was in for repairs. The set up is not huge but the customer service is fantastic. Brandon (branch manager) made the process easy and quick for both the pick and up and delivery. I would definitely rent again and recommend.</review>

Olivia who works the front desk is awesome. When I came to return my car, she was the only employee present (3 people had called in sick) yet she was courteous and quick in helping myself and about a dozen other customers. This woman is a customer service pro. I'm impressed Enterprise: you hire smart people. Here's hoping Olivia gets a raise, or at least some props.<//review>

This is one of the best car rental locations in the Bay area. Prompt friendly service with reasonable prices. They remember you and make you feel valued. I brought a vehicle back with more fuel than I rented it with and they credited me a free upgrade.</review>

<user_name>John McGrew</user_name><Text>2 rentals in the last 6 months. Their price (via Costco) was very competitive.  The cars were extremely clean and ready. Gas level has not been full on two rentals but they always adjust the return notes to match . Rental process was quick and convenient.  There were enough staff that there was at most a short wait..

A bit disappointed at first because the vehicle I requested wasn't available,but the women there did the impossible and found me a much better vehicle honoring my original cost. The assistant manager was a bit of a prick, the type of guy that takes his job  way too serious, if it wasn't for him, I would of given a 5 🌟 no doubt. Will rent again though hopefully he isn't the one helping me.<//text>

Every time I am here they tell me everything should be set up and ready to go but when I get to the front desk, they have nothing working and my information doesn't come up. The first time they took over an hour to pick me up when they were just around the corner from the house, I could of walked but they insisted on getting me. The second time they picked me up promptly and the driver was very courteous and I really commend him however the ladies at the desk couldn't process my claim number or reservation number, both of which I confirmed with Allstate afterwards, that they worked. The options they gave me was to pay out of pocket and do the run around with Allstate myself. I admit, I lost my temper but I am tired of the terrible service when I am already going through a mass amount of stress from being hit in the first place.
I will not be returning here.</Text>

It is unethical to only ask satisfied customers to write reviews.

<Rate>1< /Rate><Review>After waiting in line a LONG time, the man behind the counter told me my rental was ready in Redwood City. I told him I thought I was in RWC. He said, “No, this is Atherton.” The google address reads RWC and my car auto insurance company directed me there, as well. Long story short, the “Atherton” office is not worth your effort. Friday evening traffic is horrendous and I am still waiting for my rental at the other “Redwood City” office - over an hour later. Argh. Perhaps Enterprise could list 2821 ECR as Atherton and 345 ECR as Redwood City. Two offices on the same street in the same city about 2 miles apart is very confusing.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>{'time': 1522001443450, 'text': 'Ms. Nash, thank you for sharing your experience with us at our Redwood City location.

My experience is always amazing at this location because they always provide the best customer service. When I walked in the door, I was help in less than 5 mins by the area manager, Casey. He has a great positive attitude and smile on his face. I was in and out the door less than 15 mins, which is great because I was on my way to go do some business.<//Review>

I reserved using ebates & did not get 2% cash back as company did not report.  Also, location states Redwood City when it is in Atherton so I could not use my points for rental as pickup location was in error< /text>

Just rent a car for 8 days, it should $20.99  per day only. But at the end when I return the car, they charge me $15 per day by Young drivers( I'm 23). I don't think they show me before at the bill, but they add it when I pay. Because I'm in a hurry, so I just ignore that, but after that I there is something wrong.<//text>

Have had a boat there for 40 years.

<rate>4</rate><review>A great marina with all you would need. It does lack modern upgrades like plastic docks instead of the splintering wood planks that’s there. It has a loading dock, gas station, lots of restaurants, and a yacht club which should be enough for most.  It also has visitor moorings for people or a there for short term reasons.< /review>< pictures>

This is a very large marina in the South Bay beach area of Los Angeles County. Facilities include the marina itself, an office building with office rentals, a 6 story apartment building, a fitness club, 2 yacht clubs, and a boat yard with repair facilities.< /Text>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Review>I went to get gas like any other day.  When I started pumping gas it started leaking from the handle all over my car and the ground.   I went to the attendant to address my issue.  Nick was unmoved by my concerns, even though they not only posed a safety hazard to me and everyone around me, but it also caused a potential for my paint to be ruined since it leaked all over my car. I had to say it several times before he decided he would let his manager know at the most laid back attitude that I have ever come across in a situation like this. They were both just standing there like it wasn’t an issue. Finally nick goes to grab something to clean it up.   The supervisor Sharon only decided to come look at it when I start taking pictures.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Good prices but always a long line. You also have to go all the way around the parking lot to get to the line. It’s sort of a confusing set up.<//Text>

Best price for gas. We get extra discount for shopping at Safeway.  Today it was not too busy, just a little.  They had service people to help us get to the first open spot. Then when we pulled up to let someone else in, an attendant brought our change out to us. What awesome service. Thanks.<//Text>

It's hard to tell if pumps are available when you are in line. Do everyone a favor, if you see an open spot while you are getting gas, motion to the cars still in line that a pump is open.< /Review>< Pictures>

The price is always right!  But the long lines and waiting time are ridiculous!  Bigger signs are needed just to figure out which 1 parking aisle takes you to the actual pump line.  It's hit or miss for them< /text>

A ton of great variety every day and all the employees do their absolute best to accommodate their customers. In particular one girl, claudia Carrillo, is always helping people! Really satisfied with the service here and impressed by the food. I've been everywhere and several colleges, never before have I seen dedication like this💯💯💯<//text>

<rating>1<//rating><text>The only reason I still eat there is because getting food anywhere else is either unfeasible with limited transportation or astronomically expensive elsewhere on campus. I have some serious health concerns about this place. Mold in some of the food served, flies baked into the muffins. The school won't even do anything because they're trying to cut their losses with the big 2020 project. Ever since it became all you can eat, whatever quality they had before declined further. Don't even get me started on how many students suffer in the bathroom after having a single meal there. It's abhorrent and needs to change.</text>< user>

Spices must be too expensive because they're nowhere to be found in all of the food. Must be charging so much for the food  to pay for salt. The only "safe" options for food is a sandwich which has been messed up before. It's a nice new building with plenty of seats but don't let looks deceive you.</Review>

I'm not a picky eater, but the food here is pretty bad. The quality and variety of food from the old dining center in the Yablokoff-Wallace building was much better than this. If you're just visiting the campus and don't need to worry about maxing out a meal plan, I recommend eating from the YW DC or a food truck instead.</Review>

I have been going to the pavillion 2 times a day for almost a month and I can say unless your vegan the food options are incredibly underwhelming always the same thing everyday fries burgers rice and don't get me started on the pizza. Going here ruined my love for pizza and I don't recommened it breakfast is mediocre with tiny as pancakes hashbrowns powder egg and the same drink juice or soda. This place has made me gain 15 pounds I don't recommened going here unless you vegan because if you are you atleast get access to a buffet of salads and many side its almost like it favor them if your an omnivore your better off going someonewhere else and if your forced to buy a plan get the 11 trust me you saving alot of money in the long run .< /text>

Same food almost every day, hit or miss taste, but the burritos are good<//text>

<Review>Wayy too overpriced for the same bland food. A pound of cantaloupe sets you back almost 7 dollars, and they purposefully overweigh it by adding a heavier plate. Menus never change for the restraunts, so after a couple weeks of eating chicken tenders and fries every day you might understand why UC students hate the Pavillion. But yeah, let's let the chancellor walk away with 6 figures.

Edit 1- UCM moved from meal plan to meal swipes. I am no longer a regular, as I live off campus now, but have paid the crazy 18$ dinner fee a few times when I was not in the mood to cook or drive somewhere. The food is the same boring stuff, although I have heard that there have been some good items on the menu occasionally. They added curly fries every once in a while, which were very good, for what they were.

At the end of the day still not worth it at all to me, but if you have nothing else, it's there. And you can eat as much as you want. Beats the scam that is the Los Reyes food truck.</Review><Gmap_id>0x80914747c33c69d9:0xd0b2b47a49cf593c<//Gmap_id><rating>1< /rating>< date>

Theyre taking measures for covid. There was a customer waiting to enter the store and did not want to wear his mask in line. An employee spoke to him, he rudely dismissed her. The manager came out and handled it beautifully. She was so patient even though he was extremely rude... wish I got their names just so they recognize them for their patience and for ensuring the safety of others!<//text>

<Text>I’ve never done a review before, but the fact that I made a google account just to let the public know how bad this store and my experience was says A LOT. Came with a friend and their family, it was completely baffling and awful to witness how absolutely rude the Disney workers are here. Most of the girls who work here look absolutely miserable doing their job. They do not care about you, their customers. Don’t buy Disney! They don’t value you, go spend your hard earned money supporting local businesses or small business!<//Text>< Rating>

<Text>ZERO STARS! Just had the WORST experience at a Disney location I have EVER had! I was waiting in line with my son (both wearing masks properly) while my husband & baby were waiting OUT OF LINE because my baby was fidgeting. The attendant named SIERRA who is apparently a “manager” told my husband he would not be allowed in since he was not wearing a mask but intended on going in the store & would put one on ASAP! My husband kindly told her he stepped out of line to assist our baby. We were next up in line (our family of 4) since they were at MAX capacity; while more than 6 people had walked out of the I noticed SIERRA whispering into her mic. I asked her what the wait was about when she tried to shove some COUPONS at me and said “since you were not following our companies policies we cannot allow you into the store”. She DID NOT take into consideration that my husband could have just stayed outside so that I could have gone in with my sons. IT IS MY SONS FIRST BIRTHDAY TODAY! When I asked to speak to another manager JESSICA was also very unsupportive of our situation. They mocked us by saying sarcastically “we hope your son has a GREAT birthday” and felt very discriminated against. I will NEVER be returning to a Disney store again. Shame on you Disney for treating your loyal customers this way! So disappointed!< /Text>< username>

They have this virtual wait list that should be great. Unfortunately they text you in 10 minute, give you 15 to get back and stand and wait and wait and wait. Line has not moved an inch in 10 minutes.  Why not keep the outside que shoeter?< /Review>

<Text>They try to limit the amount of customers inside, and it's still packed like a sardine can. They might as well just let everyone in and skip the charade outside, cause nobody social distances inside.</Text>< pics>

I was charged twice on my cc. When I brought it to the cashiers attention, she said the first swipe on my cc placed a hold on my cc and it would be returned. What?? Then their promotion of buy 2 items  get one free time of equal or lesser value. I purchased 6 items, but only 1 item was marked free. This store has poor customer service and terrible system.</Text>

* Visiting during Covid 19 *
Went a few days ago with my kids
You are “greeted” by one of the sales people
At the door but it’s not really a greeting
I felt Like I was On the phone with a bank when they read you a disclaimer
We all know by now that masks are required
We approached the store with masks (not my little one)
Important to mention that no other store in the outlet does that But ok they feel like they are being extra safe)
After she read me the “disclaimer” She asked about my daughter who didn’t have a mask on
It took me a second to answer her since she just turned 14 months and I was Trying to give her the exact age, she was very annoyed that I took That extra second to answer her And asked me again
In a more aggressive way “how old is your daughter”
It turns out that you have to wear a mask if your over 2
Last thing she made clear was to avoid touching merchandise
I felt completely uncomfortable in there with my kids
Ended up buying something that’s not even worth the tax I paid on it but that’s my fault
In the car the colors started smearing already (Minnie doll set)
I will definitely not return to that store
It felt nothing like “Disney”</Text>

I'm baffled by their social distancing line you have to stand in ubefore being allowed to enter the store and how really clueless ppl would have to be to snake that line not even 2 ft of distance between others at your side.... It is obvious that the 6 foot recommended social distancing is a radius that applies to your side as well<//text>

Great sales! Need to work on adding that family friendly and welcoming humorous Disney touch to their costumer service though. They were great at that in Ventura, then they moved store to Camarillo and they're just NOT magical anymore. Just good prices.<//review>

We LOVE this store! Amazing collection of toys, clothes, accessories, costumes, plush animals, PJ's AND DISCOUNTS GALORE! The cast members (employees) are phenomenal! You can't get better customer service at a discount store (or any retail store!). We visit this store once a month and look forward to it every time :)</review>

This is a nice and small Disney outlet store, a lot of clearance items that you will not find at a Disney store in the mall. It can get busy but our visits are always pleasant.<//text>

I love how they always have really good discounts going on. The only bad thing is that they always run out of things so fast, but im sure to fine something else.</text>

<text>Prices are good on the clearance items, but most the other prices are the same as the retail stores (at least when there is a sale). The clearance section was also not sorted at all by size so it made it difficult to find items in my size. Staff we're friendly though which is always nice.</text></record>

A fantastic way to get genuine Disney merchandise at a pretty good discount. As this is an Outlet version of the Disney store, you can find a significant discount of a variety of items from regular Disney stores. Additionally, because of the close location to Disneyland you will also find a variety of discounted Disney Parks items. You won't always find a fabulous deal every day so you sometimes you have to check back another day and you will find something.<//Review>

As to be expected from an outlet store it is hit and miss on what they have in stock.  Store personnel are kind, courteous and helpful without being pushy to make a sale.< /Text>

<text>This Disney Store is actually an outlet store that carries a lot of discounted Disney merchandise from their theme parks and stores.  You are able to get a lot of authentic Disney merchandise that you would only be able to get at their theme parks at a fraction of the cost without having to make the drive all the way to Anaheim.  Although they have a lot of discounted items, they also have new merchandise available for purchase at the same prices that you would find at your local Disney Store.<//text>< UserId.>

Lots of Disney items for the kids,  or the Disney enthusiast in your life.  The prices are not greatly discounted compared to other stores which sell Disney merchandise,  but the service and friendliness of the staff is second to none.</Text>

<Review>Unhelpful staff and management...i understand that they had a problem with their system that erroneously charged my disney reward redemption card some amount but to treat the incident that it was not an issue and making me go through hoops and asking for various requirements to get my credit back is ridiculos considering they were the ones who inconvenienced me....will never shop again to this disney store..staff definitely needs some customer service training< /Review>< pictures>

The cashier didn't know how to use my travel card. I ended up paying cash. Also the coupon code is not enough to get the discounts, you will need to take prints of your coupons. Such a waste!< /review>

Loved every dish we ordered, starting from the salad that was simple but really delicious. The pizza was great, perfect fluffy dough top with great burrata (could have been a bit warmer) pasta also very solid. Dessert with ricotta was great, and also very big, just order one. Pricey but in line with quality and area. Good atmosphere and service too.< /text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOlkEAeYCiBvo89730ZBHoZB_mvJpKOeMZBiSIh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMSUZukFqc33zOR98OOaZk-Bnid1BB_0ZDLtMcq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO5iLpg0tx4cm65_YkWHBFByCZpcBamVef1tWAN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMDkMXKPpIY8ylYTLb57JoG0KUBV2Zi_1Kfgq1L=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMCaUQLJA6gkVW-Pa47bNIn9GuAsqhcpHgqrOIu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPka18uhX3HnMdNMUAsmvUvWK71mM-1ZtD76iSz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNVG6BW2eyAPcCITYDeXmiwOd3YIHa2qoq0nqUQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< resp>

< review>
I’ve been wanting to try this place ever since an Italian uber driver recommended it to me.  I can see why!  Their funghi pizza is probably the best pizza I’ve had, ever.  It had the perfect texture and was really flavorful.  The linguine wasn’t my favorite but it was light and tasty.  The orata was impressive and I really liked the salad atop the fish, which included fresh veggies and olives.

The staff here are friendly.  We arrived earlier than others in our party so we grabbed drinks at the small bar up front while we waited.  Parking: it was easy for us to find street parking around 6:30 pm on a Thursday night. They also have valet.  It starts getting crowded around 7p.<//review>

If you're a Harry Potter fan, you are ordering that Butter beer, even if you're not, you should as it's really good!  It's made with house soda as well. The House bread and burrata are really good as well. The only reason why it's 3 stars for me is because of the pizza. It was not bad...it was in fact good but could have been so much better...the base is excellent, however there was just too much of the tomato sauce and it was a flood of tomato sauce in my mouth with each h bite.<//Review>

Great food and great service thanks to Noe at the bar. My favorite so far is the Crispy Octopus. The Fiorata pizza is also very delicious with a small glaze of honey. Definitely going back. Thanks again Noe!!< /review>

Really enjoyed dinner here... Visiting from out of town but would most definitely come back here for dinner. Pleasant greeting when we walked in, friendly waiter and attentive staff.  Favorite dish was gnocchi in pink sauce. Favorite dessert was trio of gelato!</text>

Food was great. The pizza was excellent. Amazing crust on the pizza. The pasta was great, and the 32oz aged bifsteca was very good. Keep in mind that the steak should be shared it's a lot of beef, but it was very well done. Valet parking only but there is plenty of spots on the street just, read the signs carefully and there are meters. It was casual and cozy, I would recommend it.< /Review>

The food here was pretty good. We enjoyed our drinks as well. This low lit restaurant was a fun Friday night date for us. We have not been motivated to return here, despite how delicious everything was. Between the wait and the difficulty parking, coming back just seems like a lot of work. However, I highly recommend trying this place for yourself. If you are having a date night with your partner, share your food. I am glad we did.< /Text>

<Review>What I'm saying here is probably no different that what has already been said many times before.
Delicious Italian food. Good service. In a basement on Pico. Easy to miss from the car so look out for Picca signage(now closed Peruvian restaurant). Pricey but at least it has good quality.
Even though they're a nice sit down restaurant (but not at all overly formal & stuffy attitude), you can still do takeout.
Known for very delicious pizza (among the best Neapolitan style ones around), but some of the other stuff is really good too.<//Review>< user_name>

<Rating>2<//Rating><text>I was made to feel unwanted from the second I walked in the door. I apologize to the hostess for interrupting her and requesting a table in the empty restaurant. I then waited for 10-15 minutes for someone to acknowledge my presence. Eight people in the restaurant. She did inform me it would be busy within the hour; however, it was her attitude that was unacceptable. Don't make assumptions about people who walk through the door. That said, I was getting ready to walk out, but my server was great which is why I didn't leave.< /text>< pics>

We ordered two pizzas and both were disappointing. The greens they used on the pizza was overpowering and that's all you could taste. The prosciutto was just dumped on the pizza.
The dough was extremely chewy and the pizza was too bready to call it an Italian pizza. The pizza dough smelled like crepe and that bothered me the whole time.
Service was extremely slow. Although we were seated as soon as we arrived to our reserved table,  It still took service 20 minutes just to get us water.
It is a nice place and atmosphere - though a bit clustered and loud. I would not recommend this place; for the price you can get much better pizza in LA.
Disappointing experience, we would have been happier ordering from a pizza chain like Jet's.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

One of the best dining atmospheres in LA. I was pleasantly surprised by the commitment to Italian cuisine. In terms of the pizza: the dough is the best- soft, complex, and high hydration. Highly recommend.<//text>

Amazing! The restaurant is very small and intimate, but the service is great and the food is unbelievably good. We started with the octopus salad which was very flavorful. My pasta was the best I've ever had. I can't remember the name but it was one of the specials with lobster and asparagus. I've never had anything like it. Tiramisu was nice too but we were too stuffed to enjoy it. Can't wait to go back!<//Text>

This is place so good! Best dinner of my life! I serioisly wanted to hug all the chefs. I had the squid ink campo****** for 20 and my girlfriend had the the crispy octopus for 25. Small portions but so, so flavorful!

They should offer a service where the waiter feeds you as you continuously high five your significant other across the table because the food is that good.<//text>

Very hip atmosphere, with excellent food. Make sure to order the cacio e pepe off of the secret menu. The only complaint I have about the restaraunt is that it is a little dark, but it fits with the theme so I forgive the lack of light a little bit.< /Text>

Best meat balls ever, and I mean ever.  A green salad with some citrus and an awesome dressing and a multitude of flavors.  Imagine a salad that wasn't bland or boring.  I wasn't so wild about the pork chop.  But I would go back again definitely.< /Text>

The lamb chops were poor quality, mostly fat and not cooked to request (rare instead of medium). After bringing it to the restaurant's attention they brought a horrible complimentary glass of some jagermeister/cinnamon shot. Upsetting to see the objective is to turn as much of a margin by setting excessive fixed prices with low quality food.

<review>I've heard about this place for a long time and they always told me that their Pizza was the best... I'm from Naples Italy and spent 20 years in the USA and when people suggest you a Pizza place I'm always sceptic.. I've seen alot of horrors called pizza.. So because Sotto is a walking distance from me and I was nostalgic to eat a decent pizza I came here and ordered one, guess what... It's the best Margherita I've ever eaten in the US. Well done! I finally found a place that gave me a taste of home for once. Buon appetito!< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Nice space, they are from OC not Italy for one ... and man you all need to stop burning the pizza a leopard is the goal burnt is not I see this a lot lately in LA and it comes from poor technique and oven management ... you do not see burnt coal or wood fired pizzas in the birth places of these pizzas ... other then that this place shines and the support food it great.</Text>

🤮SAVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY !!!  RUDE STAFF, TERRIBLE MANAGEMENT🤡, BAD SEATING, Just a BAD EXPERIENCE overall !! 😕They have no interest in their clientele, they don’t care if you like it or not.  They have been handed undeserving success based off reviews they must have paid for.  Our DRINKS  were very BLAND, basically tasteless,  NOT good ! The Other Margarita tasted like it had dirt in it !!!  I don’t even know what would make that happen. 🤢 You could get get the same tasteless drinks from any corner bar with bitters, in fact it would possibly be better.  The receptionist was absolutely unintelligent 🤡 and or just rude 😠, along with  several other employees we encountered 😡.  I basically felt like every employee there was miserable 😩 and hated their job. People at the bar were complaining, telling us how bad the service was; they had been waiting for 20 minutes for a refill of their wine. We should have known to leave at that point. This might have been an amazing place at one point, however they’ve become lazy and disinterested in their customers. Management 🤡 obviously has no understanding of customer service or just doesn’t give a SH T. Their UNDESERVING success can only be due to an overwhelming constant flood of people here in LA.  People must be reading reviews from 2011 when this place was new and needed to earn clientele.  However it’s no longer 2011, and you can expect a TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE in 2018 !!!!  I watched several people simply walk away from the receptionist’s attitude 😡. I wish we had just walked away too.  GOOD LUCK if you decide to give this “once was great” place a try !!!  You will surely end up frustrated and disappointed, wishing you had gone somewhere else.  😩. If you want great pizza go to the 800 degree pizza just a few miles away by the campus.  We got there just as they were closing, after leaving Sotto hungry.  I explained our experience at Sotto to the manager at the door of 800 degree pizza.  He was so nice he not only let us in, he also comped us our pizza 🍕!!!  😀.  Btw.  I called the owner Dina to explain what had happened.   She never called back. Lol. 😳I guess she was too busy to care that her employees are ignorant and not representing her very well. 🤯👎🏼,, or maybe they do.  Lol.  In my experience, it all starts at the top.< /text>

Italian with a modern spark. Pushes the boundaries of the cuisine with some bold experimentation that's sometimes a little hit and miss. Overall, definitely worth a punt. Wine was handled very well by an enterprising Sommelier.</Text>

This place is pretty awesome. The atmosphere is unique, service was excellent and the food is even better. I've only been here once, but want definitely want to go back eventually. The only downsides were that the smaller tables are really close together and the cocktails are way overpriced for what they are.</text>

<Gmap_id>0x80c2bbe3e14a04bf:0x1af88e2dc98857d0< /Gmap_id><Text>We came here for dinner on a Saturday night, so it was fairly crowded and noisy. The food was well-meaning, but definitely on the pricier side.

We started with the radicchio salad. Toss radicchio, which is inherently more of a bitter leaf, with a healthy dose of strong parmesan and an anchovy vinaigrette and you get a salty, bitter salad. They would do well to finish the salad with a sprinkle of caramelized lemon juice to balance the bitter with sweet. Along with the salad we got the chickpea panelle, which was definitely a winner. Fried diamonds of chickpea flour batter, again with a grating of parmesan and lemon wedges on the side made this dish especially curious for us, as we had never seen chickpea flour used outside of Indian cuisine! Not sure if they do this for all guests, but they provided us with a recipe card at the end of our meal!

The main entrees we got were the rigatoni pasta and the funghi pizza. The chicken liver ragu on the pasta had an earthy, herby sweetness to it that hit the right notes, and the rigatoni was cooked well with a strong bite. Since I almost always order a tomato-based pizza at restaurants, we opted for the mushroom pizza. It had a garlicky mushroom cream base and a sturdy-yet soft crust which beckoned the "folding" pizza handling technique. About that, the crust was soft and chewy. Not the most ideal crust IMO because there wasn't much of a crunch to the bite, but to each his/her own. It's got the signature char marks and carries the pie well, so it's a keeper. I can't speak much to the mushrooms other than saying there was a good variety. I would be remiss, however, to leave out the scamorza really pulling through with the sharp smoky goodness. to complement the meaty mushroom flavor. Who says you need meat to get great flavor??</Text><response>None< /response>< time>

Used to be great but it is no more.

Saturday night - party of four.

Our waitress couldn't remember 50% of what we ordered and kept coming back to ask what the order was.

Every time I looked for her - she was behind the cash register area swirling a glass of white wine and chatting with the other waitresses not really giving a flying f*** about us.

It took 90 minutes for us to get our food at 9:30pm

I just ended up going to the young lady at the bar area whenever I needed something. She helped me out while our worthless waitress was nowhere to be seen.

This place used to be great but even the food tastes different, more bland.

The chicken liver ragu had truffle shavings (wasn't there before) which gives it a very strange texture and flavor.

I think Sotto has its days counted and it's well on it's way to fading into obscurity.</review>

Spanish Tapas style Italian gem with great atmosphere, open kitchen window, great mixology drinks and fantastic wine. We started with homemade bread, burrata and olive oil. The pork meatballs were great as well as king trumpets(mushroom) salad. Everything we had was delicious especially the pizza, don't be afraid to ask for suggestions, the staff is very friendly and helpful.
Also a great spot to just grab a cocktail and appetizer but feel free to stay for dinner and dessert, the chocolate crostata is great.< /review>

Chose Sotto for a holiday dinner with a friend and was happy with the choice.  Located underground the popular Peruvian restaurant Picca, Sotto is a dark, cool, hipster-chic space.  Furnished handsomely in dark wood and draped in dim lighting, the space feels hip and modern while retaining a rustic air.

I couldn't choose between 3 pastas and a pizza, so we got all of them -- happy holidays to me!  The spread consisted of the Paccheri, Rigatoni, Squie Ink Mafaldine, and the Guanciale Pizza.  I really appreciated our waiter, who was more than knowledgeable about the entire menu (both food and wine) and took his time walking us through the various options and their merits.  He was really sweet on top of it all, so I was won over before the food reached the table.

My favorites in order from most favorite to least are the Rigatoni, Paccheri, Guanciale, and the Squid Ink Mafaldine. The Rigatoni came with chicken liver ragu, maitake mushrooms, and grana cheese.  This is a very earthy dish, with a lot of deep flavors coming from the rich chicken livers and the mushrooms.  I personally love this flavor profile and this dish was an instant hit.

The Paccheri is a wide tube pasta that came with sweet and spicy pork ragu, rapini, and fennel pollen.  Let it be noted here that all of the pastas of the night came perfectly al dente and were quite lovely.  The paccheri noodle in particular was very nice -- the wide tube pasta held the flavorful ragu well and it was a cohesive and complete dish.

The Guanciale pizza came topped with house-cured pork cheek, ricotta, scallions, and fennel pollen.  My favorite part of Sotto's pizza is definitely the dough -- soft and chewy with just the right amount of elasticity. I ate every last bite of crust, believe me.  Other than that, the pork had good caramelization - although I wish there was more of it - and I couldn't help but want some sort of light saucing, as the pizza ate a bit dry.

Finally, the Squid Ink Mafaldine was probably the most disappointing dish for me, only because I had the highest hopes for it walking in.  Although there was good textural contrast from the crunchy breadcrumbs and the creamy burrata, the sauce was overwhelmingly acidic and tasted more of pungent tomato than anything.  It wasn't what I was expecting and, unfortunately, I wasn't completely sold.

Overall, I really enjoyed my meal at Sotto.  The ambiance along with the great service and pastas made me a very happy camper and I don't doubt that I will be back in the future.< /Review>

Don't trust their times on Google. My party and I were just turned away at 9:25 even though they are listed as closing at 10:30. If you are going to list your times, then stand by your times. And if you're going to list your times, make sure it's the time that counts; and that time is your kitchen hours.</Text>

You can't go wrong with all the dishes that they offer.  But if you ask me what the best thing on the menu is, its the "pasta de pollo or de camaron". It's hands down better than anything Olive Garden has to offer. Their take on a chicken alfredo is absolutely delicious! Highly recommend this dish & anything on their menu.< /Review>

Definitely a hole in the wall type place with friendly staff and a varied menu. I got a super burrito al pastor and it was satisfying and reasonably priced. I can't wait to get back there to try the breakfast because it looked really really good.</text>

What a great experience.   The food was outstanding,  the services was top notch.  Only thing is that the chicken is so good here they ran out.
I'm definitely coming back for more.
Highly recommend trying this place out if you're in the area.</review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

Although this is my first time here, I'll definitely be coming back, and wish I knew about this restaurant sooner. You know from the moment you step in this is the real deal, and is going to be a feast! The owner is a really great guy who's committed to bringing cultural depth and delicious food, and it's just traditionally most authentic.  Chile Rellenos set the high bar – lots of it!<//Text>

<review>Everything was fresh. Great rice and beans. Chile verde is all meat, no fat. The cheese enchilada was delicious, as was the huge flour totilla. The only thing keeping it from a 5 star was the Chile relleno, which was flavorful but soggy. Overall, a great meal and super clean</review>< Pics>

This was a great vacation! All meals are paid for, the chow is great, and the chow hall staff couldn’t be better! The instructors are so nice and they teach you very well, they will also kindly help you with working out, it is definitely the most physically fit I’ve ever been! About 3/4 of they way through you get to take a trip and shoot rifles and go on nature walks, the walks do have some gentle slopes but nothing you couldn’t handle. At the very end you have the grand finale and you have a blast camping and hiking and you finish it off with an amazing breakfast!<//Review>

It's very crowded if you choose to visit during the summer, so plan accordingly. They like to say it all expenses paid but when read over the fine print you find out you paid extra for that package. The food is pretty good during your stay but you quickly realize that the decent variety of food was average at best after you leave. The lines at the restaurants and barbershops are extremely long but they go quicker than expected. Haircut options are very limited but you can upgrade your package with more options at no extra cost the longer you stay. A positive is the bedrooms are massive but the negative is you'll have to share with quite a few roommates. By far the best thing here is the fitness program. The staff are very motivated to constantly keep improving your physical fitness levels. They won't let you give up, they'll even provide extra individual workouts for you if you desire. The staff were a little to motivated for me. For some reason they felt like they had to yell all the time and they expect you to do the same, so that was kinda annoying. Overall my stay was more enjoyable than average. I originally gave a 3⭐ rating but while writing I realized it my stay was quite a bit better than my current stay, in Oceanside.< /review>

<username>Nick DePalma< /username><review>I spent 3 months here. The employees are rather mean and make you move fast and scream loud.

They make you clean a lot.
They make you march perfectly.
They make you reminisce on this experience 14 years later at midnight in your bed and type a strange google review.
They make an 18 year old Homesick kid into a man.
They teach you to be proud of the uniform that you earn to wear.
They make you a Marine.

Staff was very rude and yelled a lot. I had to share a room with several other people. Room service was terrible, I had to make my own bed. Food was terrible, but surprisingly there was always a very long line of people waiting to get in.

Definitely not coming back.<//Review>

<response>None</response><Review>Spent 13 weeks here in 2000. At that time, accommodations where very cramped, staff would give wake up calls an hour earlier than requested, no laundry service, I had to wash my clothes by hand, but they did supply soap and scrub brushes. Physical training center is huge and is open 24 hours a day. Beware of the managers easily recognized by the olive drab smokey bear and lage gold belt buckles, they were all very short tempered and seemed to not care how comfortable I was, however, did look out for my health checking that I was ok at least once every week we had health and wellness inspections. Transportation by bus readily available every 13th week but only seem to go to other Marine Corps locations.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< date>

<review>Be careful what you take pictures of you can end up getting your brand new marine in trouble. Bring a jacket, charged phone, sunglasses, walking shoes(trust me the heels are cute but you'll regret them!), there are going to be kids at the graduation that don't have family members to show up so ask your marine if there are any people who need some company, DON'T WALK ON THE PLATFORM, watch your language and who you talk about again you will get your marine in trouble if their superiors find out, the oldest woman in your family group is allowed to hold onto the Marines LEFT arm(right is to be available at all times to salute) but everyone can have a turn after, there will be lots of tears 😁. Good luck and congrats you now have a Marine!!</review>< pictures>

Arrive at least an hour early. We sat in traffic for a half hour at Gate 5 only to then be pulled over for 100% vehicle inspection that took another 15 minutes. No one told us this and we missed most of the graduation. All they tell you is be seated by 9:45a but not to plan for long, long base access. Parking is very poor.< /Text>

Amazing place!!! If you are going for graduation make sure you get there EARLY! At the gate you have your vehicle inspected and they check you with a metal detector. Make sure you have your I.D. Don't walk on the grass here or the parade deck.<//text>

I spent 13 heartfelt weeks here embellishing in the fine art of becoming a U.S Marine. A small group of well dressed men led me & my peers through various tests of intestinal fortitude while being served rations of culinary delicacies 3 times per day. The staff was very accommodating and even left a piece of candy on my pillow at naptime.< /review>

I graduated from the Depot decades ago.  Then to Pendleton and Okinawa.  I have good memories of boot camp.    Becoming a Marine was one of the best choices I made in my lifetime.  Semper Fi !!<//text>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>I stepped on these pair of yellow footprints here back in 1997...
I was met by a really excited, well dressed man who said his name was sir.  I think that might have been his last name and his first name might have been  Isaac or something because we all said I- Sir any time we spoke to him.

I stayed here for about 13 weeks, the mail service is spectacular but theres no wifi which I was disappointed. My room was very clean, i mean VERY clean but I had to share it with about 65 other males.

The wake up service was prompt and very loud, but very efficient.

We were assigned a guide who took us to various parts of the property. They have strict standards so when our original was not up to parr, he was quickly replaced.

This was an all inclusive property so we enjoyed three very nice meals a day but I guess I didnt get the all inclusive drink package because there was no soda and no alcoholic beverages all though I had all the water I could drink and it came in a cool green canteen.  I guess they are very water conscious and didnt want to waste any because at the end of the night we had to drink our entire canteen and then hold it out above our heads.

The gym here is FANTASIC, great athletic director.  They have a very elaborate adult jungle gym. For more of a botique style environment they have a small area that is part exercise facility, part exfoliation called the Sand Pit.  I spent many many hours here, again with several of my very enthusiastic nicely dressed hosts.

They also have a great offsite shooting range.

If you are staying here for a while I highly recommend the hiking trail called The Grim Reaper, lovely views and a very memorable experience.

For anyone still reading this review I highly recommend coming here and trying it out for yourself. It is sure to be a very memorable experience.  You will probably, like me, spend the rest of your life reminiscing about your stay here.

A truly exquisite luxury resort. You get your health in top shape for free, and you get personal trainers that are extremely motivational! Free housing and you are also fed three meals a day! A true paradise.<//text>

The food was of high quality and the activities were full of variety. I got to enjoy rappelling down a tower with rope. The best part? They offer free haircuts and did I mention free food? Housing is free and they even PAY for you to be there. The little souvenir shop was a little disappointing but that's no penalty for a free resort stay in Sunny San Diego. They also have a nice pool.</review><user_name>MvGun</user_name>< Date>

I lived there for three months back in '93. The weather is awesome all year round as I have visited the area a couple times since at various times. Being right next to the runway of an international airport is not as bad as you would think. When it was time to catch some sleep I really didn't notice the air traffic. I would recommend anybody with the fortitude to enjoy a standard stay of thirteen weeks.</review>

<Text>One cliche I heard when I first set foot in the yellow footprints was that you never forget the names of your DI’s.  I’m my case, that is true. Taylor, Forby, Stillwagon & Bunch. I was a fish out of water at first since I had just graduated from college. Prior to my delayed boot camp graduation ( I had an extended hospital stay with scarlet fever), I managed to see that Staff Sgt Taylor assessed me as “defiant” & a “sick bay commando.”
Fortunately, I overcame that description fighting back to graduate to a productive career. All thanks to the tough love lessons learned at the Depot. Semper Fi !!!!!< /Text><time>1578169802983< /time><pictures>None<//pictures>< name>

<Rating>4< /Rating><Review>Went here for a bit of R & R after a stressful 13 years of school.  Great place to go if you are down for fun filled activities on a daily basis, whether rain or shine.  You are guaranteed 3 square meals a day except for the 2nd to last week.  Not only that but a roof over your head and free laundry services.  I was injured during my stay so I had to extend my relaxation by an additional 6 weeks, but was afforded comfortable amenities to ensure I healed properly.  Highly recommending everyone should visit this club for a stay.   Down side: a huge sausage fest.<//Review>< pictures>

Back in the summer of '64 everything was a lot better. The staff were very pleasant and extremely helpful. The rooms were very neat clean to a fault and comfortable. The food was quite tasty and there was no limit on how much you could take and casually eat while contemplating the days activity schedule.
The weather was always warm and sunny and we had loads of time to enjoy the outside.
As for the free cloths that the tailors carefully fitted for us they were the finest money could buy.
During the down time you could watch the airplanes take off and land at the nearby civilian airfield.
Everything was very pleasant at least that's how I remember it.<//Text>

<Text>Three month all-inclusive vacation. Staff could be a little more friendly. Felt rushed while dining. Beds were pretty comfortable, was woken up in the middle of the night every few days. Skip the sand-pit, too many bugs. Great walking paths with good views. Free barber on site, cut was way too close and fast, did not tip. Pool was cold, life guards seemed attentive but not helpful. Advertising was accurate, no rose garden. Last week was the crucible excursion. 54+ hours duration. Plenty of activities to keep busy, night life was the same. Snacks were provided. Hospitable greetings on the last day, checkout was fast.</Text><resp>None< /resp><rating>4<//rating><Pictures>None</Pictures>< gmapID>

I took some time off a while back and booked a stay at this resort for about 13 weeks. I wasn't sure what to expect, but I figured "what the heck?" To my pleasant surprise, this place was amazing!

The other people staying at this resort were friendly and most of us got along well. I slept in a building with an open floor plan that accommodated quite a few people. The only complaint I have is the bathroom situation can be a little hectic. Also, sometimes tornadoes would blow through and mess up the furniture, so be prepared for that.

The food was so delicious, I don't think it took me longer than a couple of minutes to eat it. I felt like such a pig, but what's the fun of a vacation if you have to watch what you eat? Plus, it's almost a shame to sit inside stuffing your face when you could be outside mingling with your friends and trying to get the full experience of this depot!

From the time I woke up until the time I finally went to sleep, there were tons of activities to do. There was never a dull moment. Also, the staff here are extremely courteous and helpful and will never let you doubt yourself. They will always help you find a way to conquer whatever it is you are doing that day.

If I have to say something bad about this place, which is only fair in a review, I would say the proximity to the airport is a little annoying. Sometimes the jets taking off would keep me awake and it always made me sad knowing people were leaving San Diego without ever knowing this gem of a depot existed.

When it was finally time to leave, which came WAY too quickly, I was sad to see this place go. From all of the staff and people I became good friends with to the beautiful interior and exterior design, I just couldn't stand the thought of waking up somewhere else. Alas, all good things must come to an end.

I HIGHLY recommend this place, but make sure you book 13 weeks so you can experience everything this place has to offer. Anything less than that and you aren't doing yourself justice.< /text>

The staff have anger and voice problems but you follow what they say or it can turn into a horrible time. This establishment will cloth, bath, feed, give you a slimming down workout, and give a place to sleep. The intern pay is low but over time will get better afterwards. As the staff say, the quickest way to leave this place is to graduate. Dont try and run, it will be a bad time! :) Rah</text>< Rating>

Very clean rooms, open environment, best nature walks on the planet, the staff tend to be so friendly that some people mistake their friendliness with neglecting personal space!

Best personal fitness trainers in the country, who give the best advice for staying healthy, and advocate tolerance towards other people though indiscriminate application of Knife Hands.

Free breakfast, lunch, and dinner! Medical and dental are covered should you need it, and the shooting range is 100% free! Would not get this offer anywhere else!

Was a fantastic paid vacation, 10/10, would do again.</Review>

My kid is there now as I type and he is loving it. I told this old Marine I'm taking care of at the VA and he said, "Loving it? Sounds like a spa to me. They beat the hell out of us when I was there. If he doesn't hate then it's not hard enough."< /review>

Best free vacation resort ever! I would highly recommend MCRD for people who are straight out of high school.
The staff were outstanding! They're so kind and patient. Whenever you mess up, they'll sit down and have one on one time with you:) one of my favorite part about MCRD was the cough drops and peanut butter packets. I believe you can bring them to the squad bay and share them with the Drill instructors.
Anyways, MCRD was a blast and the rain room was awesome:)
Hope you enjoy your 13 week stay!!</Text>

<Text>Great place, staff seemed a little rushed and pushy. The annoying stuff were things like: everyone slept in the same room, one central shower/ bathroom, but the beds were comfortable. The resort did have a great view and personal trainers, which again were very pushy, and also FREE haircuts, the barber did go a little short, though. P.S There is a 3 month required stay and one time I tried to sleep in and the staff went crazy.  Overall it was a interesting but nice stay.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Beautiful place to tour. A variety of public museums, restaurants, and stores to purchase from. The view of the inlet is incredibly, too. If you look close enough, you might see some recruits being turned into Men, then transformed into Marines.</review>

<review>Born in 1960 and reborn 28 July 1977.  My 2nd birth was much more memorable and I love the family I was born to.  All those siblings and encouragement. Food was good (and plenty) double rations as I was 116 lbs  upon arrival.  Checked out of the hotel California at 148lbs and tough as a pine knot.  The beach was beautiful but only olive drab or cammie beachwear. The parks were fantastic but very hilly and we carried our own picnic basket that was worn on our backs.  Tour guides wore nice hats and the attire was very much like the surroundings.  Checked out 3 months later and received a passport that has no expiration.  The name on it is "MARINE".  Highly recommend the "Corps" if your looking to change Everything about you.</review></record></dataset><record>

Spent a few months here, I found that the staff are very rude and extremely bossy, The accommodations are spartan at best. They do have an excellent physical activity program which runs from dawn to dusk. The food is plentiful, but they rush you out way too fast. Also the barber shop is open until 4 am which I found to be very convenient. The worst thing about the place is the constant aircraft noise. The best thing is they take you to another place called Camp Pendleton and let you shoot weapons.</Review>

Close to the airport with tons of exercise options.  Workers are well trained and very attentive with outstanding attention to detail.  Beds are a bit stiff and the main food hall can get busy and noisy.  Everyone is always in a hurry.  Totally dry:  no beer or booze.  Bathrooms are too small and cramped; showers are cold.  Arrived a slouching Johnny-on-the-block...departed a Mass of Muscle and Confidence.</Text>

I must say when I checked in it was absolutely the worst service and they were super rude but it was free so I put up with it and little did I know once you check in its hard to check out and the food was good some times bad other times.. The perks were good they had a life Coach and work out coach on staff but in return for their service since I was there for free I had to clean allot and yell allot and play fun games they made up. .. so all in all once you get passed the rude behavior it's a blast<//review>

<Text>When i first arrived with my tour group we were greeted by our host who was a rather gruff individual.  He seemed nice enough at first but lost his head rather quickly when one of my fellows asked a question i guess was out of hand.  Anyway, we got off the bus and got situated into our rooms, unfortunately the travel packaged didn't mention lack of private space available or that the showers were open showers, but hey, you get what you pay for i suppose.  Though i have to admit, this looks nothing like the pictures...i wonder if i got on the wrong bus...<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

I had a great time here. Lots of exercise, sunny, very close to lots of great places, and interesting food opportunities. I remember during our off hours, some recruits would hang out at the "food court" and eat.

Some would quibble over terms and say a more accurate portrayal would be sneaking out at night and scavenging MRE components from dumpsters and hiding them in their footlockers, Private Pyle Style, but they just don't know how to look on the bright side of life. Plus, all the food smuggled in wasn't just from dumpsters.

One recruit had his wife bring in a bunch of candy to the Mormon Sunday service, and several recruits joined him in hiding it under their cammies to sneak it back into the squad bay, where they recruit-taped it to the tops of the pipes above the showers. That was the best candy we ever had, let me tell you.

One lucky recruit even found some week-old Claim Jumpers leftovers that had just been thrown away one night, and got himself a nice Claim Jumpers meal, even if he did litter the head with the containers for the drill instructors to find the next morning. Despite the best efforts of the drill instructors, we never did find out who the lucky winner of the trash-digging contest was, though we all had our suspicions. While I could go on all day about the lovely food, there were plenty of other high points.

Though a few poor sports did break the rules about turning in everything on arrival including the most basic common sense, by and large, most people went along with it. There were plenty of fun events they hosted here such as the Improvise Toilet Paper Challenge, the Drill Instructor Shuffle, and the Bladder Control Failure March. In the end, I think the old motto sums the place up the best. San Diego Recruit Depot: Where Civilians Become Mentally Challenged Recruits.</text>

Entered back in '69 and the weather was cold. Had never been away from home but got happy when they issued me that M-14 rifle. COD was a bear but when I got to Edson range I was happy to shoot it. Rifle and pistol (.45) expert for 15 years. OORAH</Review>

<rate>3<//rate><text>great location for biz travel - really close to the airport.  i have to say though, first off, the receptionist was a bit gruff and bordering on rude when we arrived...

after what seemed like 'days' of checking in we eventually got situated in our room.  i'll give it high marks for being very clean, but it smelled like duraglit and shoe polish...not sure what that was about.

the beds were small and saggy and the sheets and blanket were really 'scratchy'...but i was able to sleep really well.

the wake up calls were always prompt.

the food was nothing to write home about and the meals all seemed a bit rushed.

i agree with what some other posters said, the soundproofing was absolutely horrible<//text>< pics>

What a terrible place to stay.  First off, you can't book a room without a three month commitment.  The hairstylists only know one style.  The staff steal your clothes and replace them with an outfit that looks like a computer threw up all over it. The food is free but absolutely terrible.  The locals are loud and don't know the meaning of personal space, in fact even the building designers neglected to incorporate any sort of private areas.  You get dust and sand everywhere and hardly any sleep.  There hasn't been any money spent soundproofing the place from the constant air traffic next door.  While I left thirty pounds lighter and overly patriotic, I can't recommend this resort with anything higher than one star.</text>

CAUTION: NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART, THOSE WHO ARE AFRAID OF THE DARK AND THINGS THAT GO BUMP IN IT OR JUST PLAIN WIMPS. In 12 weeks DI's will either make you the guy pumpin your gas or the Marine like he is. Where your parents could NOT reach you will go and find the stuff your made of and test it against yourself. Things your parents couldn't get done in 18 or so years, you will figure out on your own and start doing, or you will be through the gate with a bus ticket.</review>

<Review>Some places may offer discount vacations, others might even offer a free vacation, but to my knowledge this is the only place that will actually pay you to take a 3 month vacation free of charge. Once there, you'll receive a number of other free amenities including free meals, free water (although it's kind of yellow), free haircuts (although they seem rushed and way too close), 1-3 free phone calls and free personal trainers. But wait, there's more. While vacationing at "The Depot" you'll get free lessons in marching, shooting, martial arts and pugil sticks.

The amenities are rather sparse, but it's all part of the experience. While the mattresses are thin and the pillows are barely there, I never had an issue going to sleep in under 5 minutes. They have community showers and insist you use them each day, although sometimes only one shower head is allowed to be used. The restrooms were always spotless, even if they were missing the doors. Still, I found it quite nice some days to use the facilities while having a quaint conversation with one of my new found friends.

I would however avoid the sand pit, or that rather small piece of linoleum known as the quarter deck (which was odd because I never found any quarters there, even with my face pressed against it.) The personal trainers can be a bit up tight, but their routines are often filled with some of the best comedic material I've ever heard, although, I will warn you they're not very good at taking a compliment. Every time I laughed at one of their jokes, it was not received well, although I did usually win a trip to the pit, but it wasn't my cup of tea, although you may like it.

One negative is that there are zero women here. In fact, you most likely will not see a single woman until the end of your 13 week stay. Which I think accounts for some of my fellow travelers marrying very large women after leaving.

Finally, at the end of all, they give you a huge sendoff, beginning with each of you--who are still there--receiving a small token of achievement known as an "EGA". My ceremony was attended by a movie star, R. Lee Ermey, and was a spectacular moment, even if there seemed to have been some onion ninjas who seem to have ambushed a good number of my new friends. Then on the last day, they have a whole parade in your honor and invite your family, many of whom no longer recognize their sons.

While I had mixed emotions about my trip when I left there in 1998, I cannot recommend it highly enough today.<//Review><Rating>5</Rating><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

I just watched their military police leave base property to harass and attempt to intimidate citizens out in the public filming whatever the eye can see.
He also stepped it up a notch by telling them they could not film "from there". So he either knew they were within their rights and desired to deny them of that or he was oblivious. Either way it's NEVER a good idea to leave the base to contact civilians that are just standing in the wide open area, in broad daylight.< /Text>

< Review>
Friendly, fast, and reasonably priced! I have yet to leave here disappointed. Everyone here knows what they're doing, and does it well. Ariel and Staci always do exceptional work, so if you've never been, ask for them. I have been coming here for quite some time now and see no reason to stop. Very affordable pricing and it never takes long to get a quick cut. Highly recommended!< /Review>

One barber lost his wife, one lost his home, one has cancer, and the other two are single parents with kids out of school, so we had to make due. Believe me, we are putting out feelers in every direction for qualified staff, so we can provide our full range of services, 7 days a week, as before this devastating year and a half.\n\nSorry we weren't able to provide the service you were after this time, but\nI'm glad you thought we did a good job for you with the service we could provide.\n\nI'm in MTW 9-4. If you can ever make it during those times, I'm certain you'll enjoy an old fashioned, hot lather shave. I look forward to hooking you up.\n\nCheers!"}< /resp>

One-size-fits-all covid precautions were redundant, expensive, and frankly an insult and hardship we were unwilling to entertain. Looking back now,\nIt was a gamble because people just weren't aware of the training we have in disease prevention and protocol, so some people may have felt we didn't care.  We always have and always will care about our customers.  That's why we have done this for 5 generations. If we don't take care of our customers, they can't come back.\nThanks for this opportunity to express 'our' side. I'm happy you enjoyed our shop.\n\nCheers!"}<//response>

Larry is the man!! Came in from Alabama for a wedding and needed a quick haircut. Larry did an unbelievable job and held great conversation during the haircut.

10/10 will continue to procrastinate haircuts until day before wedding.

Highly recommend this place to everybody.<//review>

I really only like it when Stacy cuts my husbands hair. She does a good job. But we hardly ever get Stacy. Thus he hasn't gotten a good consistent haircut from here in well over a year. He always has to cut more off when we get home, or a few days later. Like the front is great but the back top is always too long. Of course he never catches it when he's in the chair.<//review>

{'time': 1523115329074, 'text': "Hi Sarah\n\nIm so sorry to hear your husband has had issues with certain aspects of his haircuts at our shop. I'll be sure to share this with our crew so we can all be on our toes in the future, as we aim always to give precision haircuts in a family friendly, clean, environment. Perhaps just a few extra moments making sure his hair is to his satisfaction can amelirorate this issue, as I can vouch for the competance of all of our barbers.\n\nWithout your feedback we could not address the issue he is having, so I am grateful for it.\n\nI hope you'll please consider changing your star rating to 5 if you see an improvement. Its very difficult maintaining a small business with big chain corporations being built everyday (2000 coming to California alone in 2018).\n\nThank you for your loyal patronage, Sarah and Mr.Thompson.\n\nStaci Emmack\nOwner"}< /response>

Here is the Best Part!!  She cut his hair the day before Prom,  Stacy came in  opened the door after Hours  to style  his hair for Prom at NO extra  charge because she wanted him to look Great an Handsome.  How many places would do that??? So if you want to be treated  like a customer  go to any other Barber. You want to be treated with  respect  and like family  come here to The Barber Shop.</Review>< Pics>

As a Cosmetologist who has had the wonderful opportunity to watch Stacy and Chance work their magic, I would highly recommend any of my guests who came to me at a local salon in Atascadero before I moved, to go have Stacy or Chance do your hair.
If you want exceptional attention to detail and amazing conversation..  Please,  Go to The Barber Shop and have them work their magic with your hair.< /Text>

Steve was excellent. Very friendly, honest, and knowledgeable, he not only gave me a great cut with the added bonus of the warm lather, straight razor trim, but was also honest that his niche lay in cutting short hair when my wife asked if he did long hair. We were so impressed that he recommended either of the gals who work there for my wife that she will be going in soon for her hair cut. Overall, fantastic!< /Review>

(or barely ever-- pretty much only when he "needed" to! -LOL)
Since he started going to The Barber Shop, he has never looked better :)
He always gets the straight edge shave and comes home so smooth... I love it too :) I can honestly say that he has never come home with a bad haircut from them.
Highly Recommended.</review>< response>

Would give them a five star for the service. My only dissatisfaction would be there online menu says haircuts are $10 they charged me $20 each, and my son only got a minor trim.< /Text>

< response>
{'time': 1523118027508, 'text': 'Hi James\n\nI dont know where there is an online menu listing our prices at $10, since never in 30 years have we had $10 cuts- perhaps it was computer generated or a misprint.  Im sorry you were led astray.\n\nWe charge one price for every cut to avoid this very feeling of being overcharged through add-ons and upselling.  Currently we are on the bottom end price-wise for a shop of our size and quality at $20 a cut.\n\nMost people arent aware that a client just sitting in the chair costs the barber a potential sale, so your boy who "just had a small trim" potentially prevented that barber from seating a full shave and a haircut.\n\nThis is why we playfully say, "$20 to sit in the chair, the cut is free".\n\nWould you please consider changing your star rating to reflect your satisfaction with the service?\n\nThank you.\n\nStaci'}</response>

<Text>First in line for haircut, 2 other people walked in after me.  Waited 10 mins for a haircut and some lady walked out from back and got ready then took one of the other guys who showed up after me.  So glad I waited ti have someone cut In front if me.  Will never give this place my money<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>{'time': 1547307918958, 'text': "Hi Ken,\nOh boy, that would make me mad too!\n\nHowever, if you had stuck around, you would have learned that I came in specifically on my day off to cut the gentleman's hair whom you thought just got to rush ahead of you.  He was headed to his son's funeral. I'd happily have explained it had you not left in a huff.\n\nAs a family shop, we care deeply for our customers.  I would have stayed (on my day off)  to cut your hair too, in order to prevent you waiting longer than 20 minutes, had you stuck around. But chances are you would have been in a chair within moments anyway, since you had already been waiting ten minutes and it only takes 20 to do a cut.\n\nWe wouldnt have the following and reputation we enjoy if we typically operated in the manor you describe, ergo, sometimes extenuating circumstances apply. Still, it's regrettable that you had a negative takeaway from visiting our shop. That is never what we want for our valued customers.\n\nI hope you found what you're looking for."}</response><Gmap_id>0x80ecc29186f603a1:0xc5be8fdbefe1be9c<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

When I called to get a quote for homeowners insurance as my current homeowners insurance sent me a non-renewal letter, I left a message and was called back right away.  Kristen Eaton, the owner called me personally and answered all my questions.  By the end of our phone conversation, Kristen had worked up a quote for me that was right in line for us .   The following day I had some additional questions so I called and spoke with one of her agents,Debbie and Debbie also was very helpful.  We were so pleased, we transferred our auto insurance over to State Farm too.  My overall experience with State Farm; they are very professional and the customer service is 5 star. I will refer them to anyone that needs insurance.</Text>

Debbie Doek assisted me today with Homeowners Insurance, Vehicle Insurance and an Umbrella Policy.  Debbie was amazing answering all my questions, tons of patience, very helpful, very nice and super polite.  I was in a frenzy as I was notified my current insurance was being cancelled due to wildfire risk.   I was able to get insurance and by adding all my policies I’m saving over $500.00 per year and thousands of dollars if I had to get the “insurance of last resort”, The “State Fair Plan.
Debbie is AMAZING and I highly, highly recommend her!    100 stars if I could!!</Text>

My husband and I have a renters policy and auto policies on both our vehicles through Kristen Eaton State Farm Office.  The whole team is beyond helpful in explaining how the coverages work. What is covered or what is not, or what you may need or haven't even thought of getting insured.
They take the time to explain your policy in detail. They return phone calls and emails same day so I never have to wait to hear back. Plus I recently found out that they have insurance policies for your pets!!  I highly recommend this team to handle your insurance needs.< /Text>

Kristen’s team is excellent. They take the time to explain your policy in detail, have answers to all my what if questions and have better value coverages than competitors. They return phone calls or emails same day so I never have to wait to hear back. I highly recommend this team to handle your insurance needs.</text>

Kristen is a very caring and helpful agent. When we had a claim and were not receiving prompt service she referred us to a different  claims person  and our needs were quickly satisfied. When we ask questions her advice is reasonable and  helpful. Her staff supports her very well.
All of our home and auto insurance is through her office and we recommend that anyone needing insurance consider this agent and company.. You can not go wrong here!< /text>

I chose Kristen for my business liability insurance because I knew if anything were to happen and I needed help she'd be there on the spot as my agent. Each time I have contacted Kristen's office her staff has been professional and efficient. I have the assurance that my business liability is in good hands and that I have the best policy for my needs. Kristen and her staff are the best.< /review>

<review>Wasn't a huge fan when they first opened up. It was good, but it always made me feel a little sick. I'm not sure what it was.
But I gave it some time and I decided to go back finally. I can safely say they've improved, and people already really liked them to begin with!
Good food. You most likely won't be disappointed.< /review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<review>Great little spot on the corner of Atlantic blvd and Alhambra rd.  Had the breakfast burrito. It was great ... good Mexican taste ..authentic.. I will definitely recommend and I will come back to try the rest of the menu... P.S. they have three outdoor tables that you can sit down and eat at 👍🏽</review>< pics>

Over-Hyped Big Time!
I live down the block and I refuse to eat here.
Basically it’s over priced food that is tasteless and served as small portions. Not worth the money, just drive a bit further.
We’re surrounded by better choices.

Edit:

I support local businesses plenty, please attempt to reread what I said. Helpful tip, instead of coming off passive aggressive why not ask what happened during my visit and what you can do better for me to return. It sounds like you're trying to coast by thinking that I should give you my money based on the fact that you’re a small business. Also maybe you should worry less about me being blessed and focus more on your food and attitude as it can greatly improve.</text>

Chorizo breakfast burrito: ingredients tasted very fresh. If potatoes were a bit smaller they would mix better into the other ingredients for improved texture (in my opinion).

Service: fast and very friendly.< /text>

We’ve only had delivery, so it’s possibly the score is a little undervalued, but they have some really good options. The lime rice is great and we really like their burritos. The serving of guacamole is a bit small, but everything was tasty. Their salsa is more hot than it is flavor, but we may not like it as spicy as average?< /text>

I love this place. I always get the asada tacos. They have the best limes and I love the green salsa. It is spicy but amazing.</review>

I was so happy to find good chilaquiles nearby. I've tried a number of dishes here and liked most of them, but today I tried the chicken enchiladas with mole and was a bit disappointed. They didn't even bother to shred the flavorless, grey, boiled chicken.

I'll go for their beef and pork dishes, but I'll probably stay away from their chicken.</Text>

Really wanted to love this place since I live so close but all three times I went I was disappointed. Two of those three times I had hair in my burritos, and food not tasty at all and overpriced.</text>

<Review>Great tacos, also got the loaded fries  with  chorizo which really hit the spot for my comfort food craving.  It's a bit of a wait especially around busier hours,  so highly recommend ordering ahead.  Parking lot's a bit small,  but there are additional spots nearby.</Review>< GmapID>

<text>Some of the best, highest quality Carne asada I've ever had. No chunks of fat or anything, just top-notch meat. Homemade Pico de gallo is so good I order tons of extra for dipping chips. Parking can suck a little bit it's worth it for the food!< /text><gmapID>0x80c2c4de38e69b71:0xabb98531c114133d</gmapID><Time>1618700019924<//Time>< resp>

This spot surprised me! Tacos are good and especially on Tuesdays when they're $1! I've taken a few family and friends that have passed by but never stopped and they really liked it also! Service is good! Friendly staff! Prices are fair!< /text>

Came here to try out their taco Tuesday dollar special, since we already have multiple places already have similar deals. Cashier was very nice and told me which tacos were the specials and what kind of sauce I'd like to have with my order. They have a non spicy smoky sauce, the mild green, and the hot red. I took the smoky and ordered 2 asada, al pastor, and carnitas. They were very juicy and flavorful, plus they came in the right size since some places will try and skim in the portion for their specials. Overall pretty good place to try out, definitely want to come back and try out some of the other menu items< /text>

We did yelp 1st before stopping.  We ordered 1 chicken quesadilla and a potato taco, and we went back to order more potato tacos. The potato tacos are really tasty  like garlicky with sour cream/creama, the tortilla was fried just perfect to a crisp without being oily.  We were very surprised that all the workers inside were Asian.  We will definitely come back.  Chicken quesadilla was okay.</Text>

<review>My boyfriend and I have been going here for a few years now, in the beginning it was always so good! Great tasting food , big portions , and friendly staff. We would always get Asada Nachos and carnita and pastor tacos. But then the portions got way smaller and the food didn't taste as good. The carnitas would be really dry and the amount of the asada on the nachos was very small. We were disappointed a lot of the time, so we eventually stopped going for a few months. However we tried it again last weekend and it was good again. Good size portions , flavorful meat, juicy carnitas. So we will go back again and hopefully it stays good! The salsas are also really good!< /review></record></dataset><record>

Delicious, authentic street-style tacos without the ghetto LA surroundings or vibe 😂🤭 $1 tacos on Tuesday. But prices aren't bad at all regardless.  I definitely reccomend!
Perfect meal after our hike!
We got 2 beef tacos, 1 pork (I forget which one) taco and 1 fried fish taco (was a bit spicy for my low tolerance but the fish was delicious).< /text>

<text>$1 tacos on Tuesdays but only on the meat tacos (seafood and potato tacos excluded).

Came here wanting to try the burritos after seeing photos and good reviews but opted for tacos instead because it was tuesday. The normal prices are probably a bit high, but a solid deal on tuesdays.

As the reviews have already mentioned the real star of this place are the different salsas available. Mixing and matching the 3 are the best way to go here. I like the habanero sauce for a little heat but prefer the other two for flavor.

Definitely give this a shot if you're in the area, but there are plenty of great taco choices in LA so I can't say it's one of my top 5.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80c2c4de38e69b71:0xabb98531c114133d</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Service is good. Beef was a little dry in the carne asada burrito. My wife ordered both types of fish tacos and liked them, although she preferred the fried once. Horchata was excellent and seemed house made. Would definitely visit again to try other things on the menu.< /review>

Go to: toasttab/spanglishkitchen.com Great thing is when you place your order it directly gets sent to the kitchen. (*Postmates for example has to be sent to a tablet after you complete your order, printed and then sent to the kitchen) With our toasttab system it’s prepaid and will send a text message when food is ready at the window. You pay regular prices vs third party online service up charges. Also it has the most updated menu including dollar tacos on Tuesday. Hope this helps! Thank you'}<//Resp>< pics>

Photo speaks for itself.  Have given this place 3 tries and I’m done.  The torta has to much bread or not enough meat and fillings.  Dry bread is not a good meal and very upset that after many times bringing it to their attention they don’t seem to care. Otherwise it would be great.<//Text>

hit or miss. I've had a lot of problems with this place not starting my online order until I ask about it 45 minutes after it's placed. and then they rush it out and it's cold! happened 3 times. so don't online order. when I waited in line and ordered at the window the order was ready in 10 at the right temperature. if not served cold, the actual food is a 9/10. just don't order online or through postmates<//Review>

The adobada torta was ptetty testy. The meat was tender and moist, not too much spices or greasy. The orchata drink tasted like real orchata and not the powder.  I recommend this place.<//review>

This is my favorite street taco place. On Tuesdays, many of the tacos are $1. Potato tacos are also the best, but cost a couple dollars. Trust me, they are so worth it! If you want something sweet, the flan is pretty great. There is some outdoor seating but I often take the food to go.</Review>

I'd give this place 4.5 stars.  For the price the food is a good value.  Taste is really good too.  There can be a wait at times but it's not excessive.  We enjoyed the unique agua frescas and the food quality was good. Would come back again.<//text>

I stopped by since I saw a high praise on LA Times. They weren't wrong, Spanglish Kitchen was a very pleasant visit not just because of food but because of people. Girls by the window were very friendly and cheery, their smiles made my day! Chicken sope was perfect, everything I'd want from good Mexican food. Their green salsa is a must get, very hot at first but you can't eat without it!< /text>

<Review>Dry, bland food. Super long wait times. I've waited over 30 minutes for my order to come out. There's also always a crowd of people waiting for their orders whenever I drive by. I'd rather go to Baja or Pepe's for Mexican food.< /Review>< Pics>

Eat here is everything is closed because there is a curfew, an earthquake or a catastrophe and everybody else is closed; or if you are on a diet and want to pay the same price as in real Mexican restaurants but get half the side of or, actually, specimens of meat rather than MEAT. Overpriced food, small portions. I've had better food elsewhere for a better price, isn't worth it<//text>

This is my go-to taco place. I absolutely love their street-style tacos and salsas. The meats might be a bit on the dry side but that's what salsa is for. I usually order the crunchy potato, grilled fish, carnitas, asada, and pastor. They indulge my overly greedy requests for their salsas and pico de gallo (they ask how many of each when you order). Even if you're into spicy, don't pass over the mild salsa. The mild is smokey and packed full of flavor, so be sure to get mild with your medium and hot. This place has gotten got very popular, even though they canceled $1 Taco Tuesdays WAAH, so I suggest ordering ahead by phone. The service is always friendly and usually spot-on. They short-changed my order once, but they made it right without issue, and made sure the missed items were ready for me when I returned.< /text>

Nasty carne asada burrito tonight ...
80% grisel and fat = inedible! The pics don't lie.
Definitely have had better :(

Ugh, what a waste of time and $$ for overpriced yuck.

I'd recommend calling ahead to order (and not using a money sucking 3rd party service) because the service can be slow and seemingly out of order, but the food hasn't disappointed yet. It's a unique style as the name might suggest, so don't come straight from Roberto's/Alberto's/Hilberto's and expect the same thing. Tacos, burritos, tortas, and burritos are all delicious. Fish really sticks out, but all the meats are done well and I like that the carne asada isn't mostly chunks of fat like other places.
Also, if you get an itching for a burger, the Spanglish Burger is bomb.</text>

We were excited to find this so close to our conference! It is in walking distance to West San Gabriel’s SELPA office and is very quick. There was a line of a dozen people but ordering took just a few minutes and the food was out in less than ten minutes. The staff was very friendly. My friend and I were happy with our tacos (chicken, asada and shrimp). The salsa complements the tacos very well. I would rate it five stars if the asada was less tough and more flavorful, I am also very particular about carne asada. We will be visiting again to try other items on their menu :)< /Review>

{'time': 1566846584381, 'text': 'Lucky Zrao,\n\nI apologize for the bad experience you had at Spanglish Kitchen. Do you remember who you spoke with or the date of purchase? I will remind our staff to make sure proper protocol for future messages are getting passed correctly for all matters. Our bread for burgers is purchased twice a week. I will look further into this to make sure with the hot temperatures we are experiencing and keep a closer eye on the bread life. We will continue our goal to serve fresh ingredients to our customers. We would love to make it up to you and your son. If you have any questions or concerns please reach me at my direct email:  jveizaga@yahoo.com\n\nJason V\n\nUpdate:\nSo apparently after speaking with the whole staff I was able to find out more information. You came Saturday (8/24/19) and did talk to our head chef (Elmer) and cashier (Lauryn) about the burger bun. He apologized on behalf of the Spanglish Kitchen crew and offered a full refund or make a new Spanglish burger. You accepted to let the staff remake your original order plus added a second Spanglish burger at no charge. Nevertheless it would be appreciated when voicing an opinion to inform the whole truth. No phone number or name was left behind or else I probably would have contacted you that same day!'}</response>

It's ok for quick tacos. The pastor and the chorizo tacos were decent but not fabulous. On Tuesdays they are a great deal for $1.00 though😊
Also ordered hard shell potato taco which was really good. I'll come back for those for sure.
All n all its nice to have Mexican food in Alhambra!!< /Review>

<text>Where do I begin?! I crave the chorizo breakfast burrito weekly, spiced with their habanero salsa. I always also get the watermelon agua fresca. I love that the ingredients always taste fresh, and prepared right when ordered. I love the restaurant style of just pickup or delivery, the staff and kit hen always look clean and are always very friendly. Hands down one of the best burrito places in LA.

Too spicy (even without sauces), and I have some spice tolerance. Spills in packaging. Not that tasty compared to other Mexican places. A bit overpriced for the amount of food. Random bones in tacos.<//Review>

I'd been craving food truck tacos for a very long time and this hit the spot perfectly even though it's not a food truck. We had our tacos outdoors but this time on a small patio instead of sitting in the car. In my opinion, three tacos per person is a good place to start. Your belly gets filled but isn't going to burst and that leaves you with room for dessert or more tacos. The tacos are small but very enjoyable.<//Text>

The street style taco was some of the best I've ever had. Meat was well seasoned. Fish was lightly breaded and cooked to perfection. If you're looking for good, filling, low cost, street style taco... This is the place. I ate it before I took a picture, so you'll have to take my word for it.</review>< Pics>

I highly recommend their chorizo torta. Also their tortas come with like, these potato chips that seem to have been freshly made.

The food is SO good here. Service has been a little annoying at times, but they're generally nice and the frustration usually stems from the fact that they get busy so often and there's very little parking.

I recommend to go orders. But it's definitely worth it<//text>< user_id>

Everything is fresh. If you're not sure what meat you want ...ask for a sample! Everything is so delicious. But I always go for the huraches! Small seating area outside. Shares parking lot with a liquor store.<//review>

Excellent taco stand. Pastor and chicken tacos were the fan favorites. Horchata was homemade and hit the spot and habanero salsa offers just the right amount of heat.

$1 Taco Tuesdays and liquor store next door with excellent selection of beers, how could you go wrong???<//Text>

<Review>Average Mexican food, decent customer service. Wait can be long at times and could use a second cashier. Portions have been getting smaller, especially street taco Tuesdays, kind of disappointing for the price.
Nothing "Spanglish" here, as the name might imply creative cuisine. Parking can be tricky, as there are only a few spaces and shared with the adjacent liquor store. A decent Mexican fast food option for the neighborhood.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

I've had better food elsewhere for a better price, isn't worth it I ordered the carne asada fries and there wasn't enough toppings on it, wish it had cilantro and onion with some diced tomatoes or something but it just had a little sour cream with cheese and the fries were soggy with excess oil, I've had better carne asada fries at the estrella in pasadena so compared to those it just was bad and not worth it...never going there again my boyfriend had the torta and he didnt like his food either he was complaining the whole.time we're just used to better mexican food I guess.< /Text>< Pics>

Delicious tacos... It's very cool little Drive-In mainly take out... There are benches you can sit in front and eat... When I was there which was during an off hour, it was packed, so alot some time for your order to be done. It's quite delicious... And the number of people waiting for food in Los Angeles, where Mexican food is prevalent, speaks to quality..</Text>

<Name>Marie Moreau</Name><review>The food is delicious. The prices are a bit high in my opinion for my budget.  However, it's worth the meat and food quality. I hope they do not change the meat vendor. It's a clean place, great fresh food and the owners are nice. Again, I am a big supporter of family owned places in surrounding areas. I get the burritos when I go and they are tasty, not fatty not oily just the way I like it.</review><Rate>5</Rate></record></dataset><record>

We went to Spanglish Kitchen on kind of a whim with the family. What we experienced was really surprisingly good Mexican food and a sea of wonderful Asian options in Alhambra California. To me it's the kind of Mexican food I want to have. And I really really loved the al pastor they do it right!< /Text>

<Text>If you've eaten here & are Mexican you could tell there is nothing special about this place. It's all average if not worse and way too over priced for the portion sized. Rice taste like it's been mixed with refrigerated rice & cooked rice. Greasiness can also be a problem & overall not worth spending. You're better off going the extra mile to east Los angles for some real Mexican or to Pasadena for some king taco, both very close.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80c2c4de38e69b71:0xabb98531c114133d< /Gmap_id></record>

Awesome, authentic street tacos. Cheap, delicious but could've been spicier. The pepper that came with one of the meals, though... that was spicy!</text>

<Text>Have heard good things about this place and was driving by so decided to stop.

Ordered the asada nachos and was underwhelmed. The good: the chips were good quality and held their crunch under the cheese. The bad: the meat was overcooked so was dry and they give you a small portion. They don't give you guacamole in the nachos, that's blasphemy lol. A bit greasy and while I understand they're nachos and melted cheese I should not have a small pool of grease at the end.

Also ordered 2 fish tacos, one soft and one hard shell. The shrimp was under seasoned and do yourself a favor and get the hard shell.

Overall I gave it 3 stars because it's average but I certainly wouldn't go out of my way to come here. Plus, they're a bit overpriced in my opinion.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x80c2c4de38e69b71:0xabb98531c114133d< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Don't go here if you're vegetarian/vegan and expect $1 tacos on Taco Tuesday. Spanglish only offers beef, chicken, al pastor, and chorizo for $1. Apparently it's too much work to make veggie tacos. The main reason I'm giving Spanglish a 2-star review instead of a 1-star review is because I purchased the veggie nachos and they were pretty good.<//Review>

$1 Taco Tuesday!  Too bad it doesn't include their famous potato tacos, which have been compared to Porto's potato balls.  Everything has been good here, but the regular prices are a bit like food truck prices.<//text>

I discovered this place less than a year ago and was not disappointed. The food is fresh, filling and delicious. My go to for breakfast is the chilaquiles de chorizo and café de olla. You should definitely stop and try this place.< /Text>

<rating>4<//rating><text>I would like to give them 5 stars, unfortunately, I ordered crispy fish tacos,and instead, received crispy.  shrimp tacos. I did eat them and enjoyed the batter and crunch.
Their Habanero salsa is wonderful!
Ive been struggling to find carnitas that is well done, and they've got it!!!
I know with today's internet that they're still missing some basic information, such as; hours and posted menu, so when people view their store, they can observe what is being offered (even when they're not open) without searching them on the internet... they're missing out on an entire generation.
I wish them great success!
With a menu as diverse, and yet,traditional,as they offer (at very reasonable prices), they should do well.

<text>Geezuz this is a Mexican oasis ... I tried 3 different tacos the asada (beef), the pastor (pork) and the chorrizo (sausage).

All the meats were absolutely delicious and flavorful from being marinated; each taco comes with onions and cilantro served on a very fresh corn tortilla. The sauces are extra but not a complaint. I highly recommend having them grill jalapeno peppers (each whole one is $0.50). Ask them and they will cut them up. They make an excellent addition to the taco.

They also offer a very diverse menu. Sure it's a little more expensive than a run-of-the-mill taco truck or a Chipotle's but you definitely get what you pay for in terms of quality and taste. This is a place worth coming back to many times over just to taste their menu.

Everything is made with very high quality and the people working there are exceptionally friendly. It's a busy place and once you taste the food you'll know why.< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Great potato tacos.  my son loved the beef taco meat, and he is a very picky eater.  Got made at me when I took a small piece to try.  that says a lot, he likes to share.</Text>

Subpar Mexican cuisine.  My nachos were just melted cheese and whole pinto beans.  The hot sauce is not real salsa,  instead is made with mayo.  My asada tacos was all fat,  no meat.  Not ever coming back here.<//review>

Guest, the restaurant has a small parking lot and not that easy to get to. No indoor seatings, only outdoors. There's street tacos Tuesdays for $1 so it gets busy. We tried most of the meat. Tacos are good flavored but really small, with single corn tortillas. I think even 5 would barely fill me up and i don't eat that much. The spicy sauces are delicious. Might return to try other things on the menu especially their burritos and agua frescas.<//review>

<review>Cozy hole in the wall counter with small patio seating for about 20. Parking lot space is limited but street parking is plentiful on Alhambra Rd. Be careful of the fast moving traffic on Atlantic.

Most things seem to be cooked to order rather than being reheated. The huarache base was crispy and chewy without being too oily. The meats can be a bit on the salty side but is great as post-run or post-gym food.

I recommend a large melon agua fresca to cut the salt.< /review>< pictures>

Hands down, amazing flavor, quick service, and friendly customer service! Randomly picked this place on our drive home from Los Angeles to Las Vegas. They deserve more than five stars. We ordered their carnitas sopes, carne asada fries, and chorizo and eggs. We will definitely be back again when we are back in town.</review>

I very much enjoy this place. As others have said parking isn't great and it is outdoors. But I thoroughly love the food. If you're looking for a recommendation I will usually have the carnitas torta or soft shrimp tacos.</review>

Came for a quick snack and thoroughly enjoy the food.  Most taco spots give you 2 tortillas with your Carne but this place does it with one(Big Ups). Plus the meat portions were plenty. I had the al pastor taco and it was delicious with the pineapple topping. I will definitely come back for more<//text>

Although it looks cute from the outside, I wished they could provide a bit more options and more salsa. For an order, you only get a tiny cup of salsa.</review>

<Text>This place always amazed me, Its in the coroner of a tiny parking lot and has so many options chilaquiles,  flautas,  tortas, quesadillas, tacos, flan,  burritos, and so much more. The meats are well seasoned and have no fat hanging on. Veggis options are also available. My favorite things to get here are the chicken tacos with the green salsa, which is in my opinion their best, not over powering yet adds a kick of flavor; as well, as there tortas which have a nice soft bread a slice of  queso fresco, tomatoes, crisp lettuce,  avocado, and meat of your choice. With the torta you get  potato chips( which looks luke they make there👍) a roasted chilli seasoned with some delightful salt. If thirst they have fouantin drinks, water,  horchata, and freshly made melon water. Finally if you have room for dessert they have a average tasting flan.
I would recommend this place for quick bite or for take out. 👍<//Text><UserId.>117390628903220216467</UserId.></record></dataset><record>

I had the pastor tacos, and a chorizo burrito. Both were delicious.
They put little pieces of pineapple on the pastor tacos!<//text>< user_id>

Absolutely love Spanglish Kitchen!!! It is the best fast food Mexican restaurant there is! There Nachos are sooo great wether it is Asada...Carnitas..or Pastor! And they have potato tacos that are the bomb!!! We do avoid it on Tuesday though because they have taco Tuesdays and they have $1 tacos which is a great deal but there servings tend to be a bit smaller on Tuesdays. Another thing is the sauces...my boyfriend and I love the habanero sauce and the red sauce...but we ask for 6 at a time because they put such a small amount in each container..so 3 equals to one. But we do love the food here...we recommend it to anyone who wants good Mexican fast food! We will definitely keep going back!<//text>

Delicious Mexican food! Chicken Milanesa sandwich was well flavored and the side of homemade potato chips had great seasoning. The chicken burrito smelled and tasted amazing. Pineapple and mango agua fresca was refreshing and not too sweet. Prices are reasonable for the delicious food to be found here< /review>

It is obvious to anyone paying attention that Americans have an obsession with Mexican food especially in L.A. So what Spanglish Kitchen has to offer? They offer simple, delicoso and authentic Mexican food. It is located in a little plaza on the corner of Atlantic Blvd and Alhambra Rd. We had Tortas and Asada Burrito with chips. The meats are fresh, juicy and soft for your mouth to devour. Staff are very friendly and competent. Similarly, their service is fast. Prices are relatively $ fair. They have outdoor seating only. Parking is very limited. In our humble opinion, Spanglish Kitchen is a great place to grab food. Definitely we'll be back!! Luckily we live just down the road. #SpanglishKitchen</text>

<Review>Service was good ,  aqua frescas are really good. The food was very mediocre, maybe because I'm from east l.a and used to authentic food. But it didn't do it for me, Tried the sope , tacos and torta.    MISSING FLAVOR !!!< /Review>< Pictures>

This is your Tex-mex wonder child here. They are like chipotle style Mexican food but way better and a whole lot cheaper. This kitchen also has some menu items that some English speaking only people might not know what it is. Great agua frescas and their fries come in large quantity. I’ve already had their El pastor burrito and their burger and both are very good.

Be sure to try their $1 street taco tuesdays.< /text>

Best chilaquiles I've had in the San Gabriel valley area! Sopes are worth it. They offer a veggie choice for every dish, so I can enjoy any type of item on their menu, which includes huaraches, tortas, sopes, tacos, burritos, etc!
Finally, homemade horchata to top it off.
Mexican food heaven!!</Text>

overpriced undercooked kid portions .

ordered a bean n cheese as I just needed a snack and @ $4 n change when he handed me the burrito , I knew right there I was thier latest victim .

burrito was no bigger than a taco bell bean n cheese and I made the mistake of not snapping a pic and I'm not trying 2 b a bean counter however I was given 37 beans , that's right folks 37 beans and a MRE's worth of cheese , no JOKE ! and the burrito was cold to put icing on the cake .

do not eat here unless u have no choice n r within walking distance . YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED !</Text>
