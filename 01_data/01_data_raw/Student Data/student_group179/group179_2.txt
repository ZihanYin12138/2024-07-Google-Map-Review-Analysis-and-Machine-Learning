Among the various options for leg compression boots, Air Relax stood out as the clear choice. Tried several, went with these, not disappointed.</review>

<text>I bought these after loving the leg ones that I got for Christmas. Overall the best way to recover from workouts or just to give your body a nice massage. I recommend these to all my friends and a few have actually bought it for themselves !<//text>< Gmap_id>

The 26-30" inseam extenders work perfectly with my leg sleeves. The customer care team took all measures to help me identify the proper size and model type I needed. Shipping was expeditious and I am now able to fully enjoy the benefits of my Air Relax on a regular basis!</review>

<text>It’s been months since I stepped off my bike after a ride & landed on the side of my foot instead of the sole. This painfully set off both my legs trying to recover. My legs ached after hikes when I’d recovered enough to walk again. After using the leg recovery Air Relax the muscle knots in my legs have reduced significantly & I’m hiking in more comfort. I use it after longer hikes now to keep my legs happy! Thanks.<//text><user>101500096880739244929<//user><pictures>None</pictures><Time>1625502925595<//Time><rate>5< /rate>< resp>

I have had the Air Relax boots for about a year when I heard about the shorts and had to have them. I find that they work well and provide strong compression in the midsection including my lower back which is most helpful to me. I use them 3-4 times per week on the B3 setting which is pretty intense. I am 6'1" and 215 pounds. The shorts also work well on my wife who is 5' 3" and 130 pounds. Very satisfied customer!< /text>

<Review>As a 60 year old Triathlete it was getting increasingly difficult to recover from my hard workout days. I was finding that I was cramping more, and my legs seemed to feel “heavy” a lot. Since beginning to use my Air Relax system, my recovery time has improved dramatically and I’m back to feeling strong even during hard work outs. Thank yo for providing a quality product at a reasonable price.</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

No need to overspend on that other company, this product is incredible and the results are immediate. I was suffering some lymphatic drainage issues on my left leg after long training days, complete reversal in a week with regular use. Absolutely recommend this Air Relax Recovery System!</text>

< Review>
We had read over the years about the positive effects of using a compression system like Air Relax to aid and speed up recovery from hard workouts. We checked out Air Relax and thought it was a great value for what it offered, so we bought it as an early Christmas present to ourselves. We have since used it several times and it really does help with recovery from hard bike workouts or hard / fast runs. So glad that we got it and recommend this product if you want to be fresher, faster, stronger for the next workout.</Review>

I received my carry bag along with my air relax system (legs) for Christmas! The Carry Bag has been great for storage and moving the whole system around to different places around the house. Once traveling is a thing again I can't wait to pack this system and use it after a long day in the car or on one of my international trips! The Carry Bag will make it easy to take along and use in a hotel room or on the road! The little side pockets will be nice for some of my other recovery tools!< /review>

<Text>I have used compression legs post bike rides for faster recovery for several years — when I recently sprained my ankle, they helped in the healing process. I’ve developed pain in my arm and recently added the arm compression sleeve. I highly recommend Air Relax to all of my friends.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<text>I've used Air Relax for 3 years now and am very happy with it's performance. It's much cheaper then other units and in my opinion does the job just as good, maybe even better considering it's most powerful setting is so strong. The best part about Air Relax is their customer service. Great people, great product!< /text>< Date>

I use this twice a day everyday. I especially love using it after walking/playing 18 holes of golf. I no longer have restless legs and definitely sleep better due to the assistance this has provided with my restless legs. I purchased one for my parents to help with their circulation as they age and they also use theirs everyday. Shipping was fast and we have had no issues with the product.</review>

Simple and easy to use right out of the box. First time I used it I passed out down stairs in living room. Ha ha ha. My teen daughter took pics of me while laughing and also happy for me to sleep so soundly. It’s a near daily occurrence and when I’m extra sore from either indoor/outdoor rock climbing or bodybuilding/weightlifting- I know for certain recovery is much faster. Automatic shut off is nice, too. Absolutely love it and enthusiastically recommend Air Relax to everyone. Thank you for making this. Semper Fi & Ductus Exemplo.<//text>

These are the best purchase I have made in years. I was hesitant cause I’m generally very frugal and don’t spend much money on bigger purchases. I do not regret anything about purchasing these. I work out hard and muscles get sore and my knee joints ache often. These help so much and keep my trips to the chiropractor and massage therapist down. LOVE LOVE LOVE</Text>

I purchased the leg sleeves for my wife for her birthday. Although a present for her, my son and I have also consistently used the sleeves. It's a daily part of our routine, and our legs feel great after using them. Couldn't be happier with the purchase!<//Review>

<review>I have had the Air Relax System for over 5 years; I have legs, arms, vest (prior to when shorts came out). The shorts work as intended but I wish they came in a larger size as I am going to loose more weight to be able to pull them all the way up. Currently my waist is 46 inches.  The shorts are for 42 inches.<//review><Rate>5< /Rate><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x80c2d19bcda2aaef:0x26e1d6ae211ba213<//Gmap_id><date>1608264097530< /date></record>

I bought this as a gift for my husband who is recovering from a ruptured Achilles’ tendon. Hubby is an avid runner and triathlete... says he noticed improvement on the first session and is already planning on purchasing the Air Relax shorts and arm sleeve! Pressure settings and programs are even better than expected; Would highly recommend.<//review>

<review>I can tell a drastic difference on the days I don't recover in my Air Relax pants. They help my legs recover so much faster from the miles I put on them as a triathlete. I also notice a difference when I wear them before races or big workouts. They seem to help a lot with warming the legs up and literally getting the blood moving. Also, the customer service is amazing!</review><gmapID>0x80c2d19bcda2aaef:0x26e1d6ae211ba213< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>The AIR RELAX recovery system is amazing. It is one of the most used gifts I have ever received. I am a college athlete so I was skeptical about it at first, but then I tried it and it is so powerful. My whole family uses it and it is great to use while watching TV. The people that make the products are also very generous. There's a one year warranty, which was helpful when my younger brother played with it. Air relax was able to fix it with no problem.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<Review>Been using the boots for about 4 weeks now with great recovery time! I'm a runner and use these after every race and training run. These help me recover from a hard effort getting back at it the next day. I highly recommend these!<//Review><name>Brandon Whistler</name></record></dataset><record>

My husband owns a basketball training organization and has wanted a pair of compression boots since he tried them a while back. The pair he tried are $1000 for a set. I didn’t want to pay that much, and at the same time, didn’t want to compromise on quality. These are perfect!!!< /review>

I became aware of Air Relax when a discussion came up on a Facebook group I am a member for Track cyclists regarding what people thought of a different brand of leg massage pants. A friend here in my local community shared that he and his 2 teens use quite frequently the Air Relax pants after cross country, alpine skiing and cycling. He also shared how much demand there was just between the 3 of them. Now that I have used my Air Relax pants for the past 3 weeks, I can't imagine having to share my unit with 2 other people! I think my usual routine is to use my unit for 60+ plus minutes nightly and especially after weight lifting or cycling earlier in the day. Other track cyclists who own leg massage pants state that the "return on investment" in comparison to paying for a massage therapist, makes owning a unit a money saver in the long run. I would concur. I would say my pants were "paid off" after 12 hrs of use!!
Also, having the Air Relax is so much more convenient than making appointments or driving to the local massage therapist. Love my Air Relax pants! The price point of these vis-a-vis other brands makes me very happy that I paid close to 50% lower than comparable products and this included purchasing an additional 1 year of warranty coverage and an excellent storage case which I plan on using when I travel with my unit. Thank you Air Relax! 5 Stars isn't high enough of a rating!<//Review>

I’ve been using the recovery leg system for the past few weeks and absolutely love it. As an avid cyclist, I’ve often struggled with sore and tight legs after big days. After wearing the boots, I feel loose and recovered!< /Text>

Made this purchase to help my father recover from Covid-related muscular atrophy. My son is an owner/operator of a CrossFit Gym (uses Air Relax LRS with his athletes) suggested that we try the system. The equipment is easy to work with and the quality is outstanding. We have been amazed by his progress and are optimistic about his recovery. Thank you!!< /Text>

The compression shorts work for me - I'm 5'6" and weigh about 135lbs and feel like the 3 bar compression is pretty snug. I'm hoping regular use of these will help with some of my recurring hip issues, which are probably due to overtraining and questionable form.< /Text>

It’s really nice after hard/long workouts for recovery and for general relaxation. Definitely feel fresher legs the day after wearing them than I would otherwise expect. They are also great for focus on work from home stuff bc ya can’t move and with them on you don’t want to. Highly recommended.<//review>

Upon reading the reviews I bought this on the assumption that the Air Relax system was a shortcut to the inconvenience of post workout stretching and foam rolling. I can tell you now from experience that it is not. If, say after a run, you skip foam rolling and stretching but only use the Air Relax you will be very stiff the next day (as you would expect). So I want people to be aware of that. I can not quantify exactly what the Air Relax system does for you. I bought it to try to combat leg pain that I get during and after running. I don't feel that has changed for me significantly since the time I bought the device. I do some form of cardio, be it running or cycling every day, and things are not substantially different with adding Air Relax into the routine. This is no miracle cure or "game changer" in my experience. The one thing that I positively can attest to is that, similar to other reviewers, I am now sleeping better. This was an unexpected outcome ! I like using it and I have done so every day since buying the device. I will keep using it because the improved sleep is very welcome. I'm even thinking about adding the shorts :)<//Text>

I have used the "other" recovery system at my Chiropractors office, but was only able to use them when I had an appointment. As an amateur ultra runner, I average 50-60 miles per week, but still need to be able to work. My legs have never felt better, while they may be sore from a strength workout, they do not have that tired feeling anymore. I do not feel like I am running on cement pillars. Best recovery tool that I have purchased for myself in a long time.<//review>

I use this product all the time and I recommend it to my friends. It works great and the quality is very good. I had to reach out to customers support for something and they were very prompt and help me 100%. Shipping is very quick. I think I have my product within 2 days of placing the order. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a quality product that doesn't want to spend extra money for other more expensive units.</Text>

After using a Normatek after my 20 mile run I realized that this was great for my recovery. I started to look at brands that were available. The Air Relax got 4 and 5 star ratings and the price was half of the Normatek. I don't need mine to run without electricity so this was a no brainer. I have used it 4 times since my pirchase and it's amazing! Using it on the 3rd setting of 4 is PLENTY of pressure. And although it has a 15 minute cycle instead of Normatek's 30, I just start it over to get my 30 minutes. I would highly recommend Air Relax!< /Text>

We have it in our family room and all four of us take turns rotating through the recovery programs throughout the day.

<Review>Can't stop using this. Love it! You can change which areas of your legs get the most pressure by moving the position of the boots. I like it best when my toes are about 2" outside of the boots. But I do change it up sometimes to work other parts of my legs.< /Review><rate>5< /rate>< time>

I got the boots because I’m constantly training for endurance events. I had been hesitant to buy them since I wasn’t sure if the price was worth it... it was. I’m part of a group of athletes in town and I’m definitely sharing my experience with them. At first the boots will feel like they might be super tight but they adjust and you will eventually find yourself looking forward to the pressure. Hopefully I can get other accessories soon!<//Review>

It's just like it's competitor, but more affordable and I especially like the fact that they give a discount to healthcare workers. It really works wonders when you have been on your feet all day. Best purchase I've made!!!< /Review>

<text>Fitting a pair of Air Relax recovery boots into my post-run routine is always something to look forward to. Best way to relax without leaving your legs just sitting. I've also used the far more expensive Normatech boots, and do not feel the price increase is even remotely worth it for those. The Air Relax are the way to go!< /text></record>

Awwww yeaaaa is what it feels like using these things. Freakin love em. The only gripes I’d have is the 15 minute cycles are too short but for half the cost I’ll take that one minor flaw. Also the plug into the machine and hose doesn’t feel super secure but it still works just fine.  Great construction and quality of materials.</Review>

<rate>5<//rate><review>My daughter, wife and I are now using these sleeves on a regular basis (daughter for soccer/XC, wife for running, and me for mountain biking). They really make a difference. I'm VERY familiar with how my legs feel after a HARD mountain bike ride. Using the sleeves right after riding makes a significant difference for the rest of the day and the next day. My daughter's school is also now using two sets of these sleeves for their winter track team, and they've been very impressed with the results. Additionally, the customer service is EXCELLENT. I've called in with many questions, and they've always done a great job answering them. When emailing customer service, they always get back to me quickly. Since I've been so happy with the sleeves, I just ordered a Hammerz, and I'm looking forward to checking that out. And lastly, they offer a 30-day money back guarantee (not including return shipping) on all their products. A great company with some really good products.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2d19bcda2aaef:0x26e1d6ae211ba213<//Gmap_id></record>

<Name>Schoche Family< /Name><user>111659454021730466956<//user><Rate>5< /Rate><review>I bought the Air Relax Leg Recovery System (110V POWER OUTLET - USA VERSION) after reading various write-ups about this and similar products. Cost was a factor in my decision, but not only one, since I still wanted a product that was reliable, durable, and worked well. So far so good. I have been using it for just over 3 weeks and my legs definitely feel much better--prior to this my calves and hamstrings felt tight. I can't speak to the long term durability of the product just yet, but no issues at all so far. Note: I am 6'1" and purchased the size 3 version. The size chart had me at the threshold of size 3 and 4, and I opted to go for the smaller one, since I knew my wife would want to borrow them. She borrows them pretty often, so I guess that is a good sign that she likes them too.</review><GmapID>0x80c2d19bcda2aaef:0x26e1d6ae211ba213<//GmapID>< response>

I love to use these after a long run or tough leg workout. The compression reduces soreness and I look forward to running because I look forward to using my Air Relax afterward!<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

I have used the leg compression sleeves over the years from a competitor at events, running store, PT, etc. but never really thought I would own my own set due to cost and uncertainty about if I would use it enough to justify. When I researched your product I found that it not only offered a better alternative to the better known brand, it was also half the price. The flexibility to adjust the cycles and especially the intensity of the pressure (much higher than the other brand) all contributed to me taking the plunge. And I am so glad I did it. My wife and I are triathletes primarily but also runners inherently so this is a no-brainer. But even more impressive was the recovery I experienced from the intense lower body weights I have been doing to get ready for ski season!! I am so happy to incorporate these into my literally everyday training rituals right up there with stretching for recover. Thank you Air Relax!!<//Text>

I am in the military and I have gone to many barber shops and haircut establishments, and have had bad haircuts before but nothing really tops the one that they just gave me. There was a younger girl who was cutting my hair and she just seemed very inexperienced and the haircut took only ten minutes. Within that ten minutes she had to have the other lady come and assist twice. When it was all said and done I saw what my hair looked like and I asked her to blend in my fade which took another five minutes and the end result was a worst one then the first. So after losing my patience but remaining polite I said It was done and went to pay. I was expecting there to be a 10-13 dollar price for my “fade” (which it wasn’t even worth five dollars) but it was $19 without a tip. When I went to sign the receipt and crossed out the tip portion the lady seemed to get upset with me and just walked away. Military be wary of this place bc they don’t know how to do a proper military cut. Don’t make my mistake. Here is the view of the back and you don’t want to see the front...<//Text>< Pics>

<Review>I do not recommend this place. I have done way better cutting my own hair. For the $22 I expected good skills and no criticism pointing things out on my head. I feel that was an excuse.</Review>< pictures>

My son wont sit still for anyone else but Teresa. We have tried other people and he always complains that they hurt him. Anna is the only person I trust with my hair. She is very detailed and amazingly patient. I'm very picky with hair cuts sometimes I'm seriously asking her to get a single hair or two and she always seems happy to help. You can really tell they take pride in their work. I feel like we get a fancy salon quality haircut but at supercuts price.</review>< Rate>

<review>I had a great experience and the gentleman next to me was a mess and Melissa did a perfect fade and he looked excellent.  All the ladies were a hoot and the music was perfect. My stylist Megan did exactly what other salons were unable to achieve. I love my hair! I will be back.<//review><username>Corinne Oshima< /username></record></dataset><record>

The  haircut was rushed. I wasn't asked if I was satisfied with it or wanted it shorter. When I was paying and she said 6 dollars I was surprised.  But, when I got home. , I over paid caused I tipped her a ten. I still need someone to fix my hair. The staff sounds so full of themselves,  I mean , conversation wise. Nope, avoid.....< /text>

I went for a trim today, I am afraid of people cutting my hair because they always leave it short and cut more than what I want, but this person did an amazing cut I loved that she gave it a change and left it as long as she could. I didn't get her name but I am very happy with her service ☺️< /Text>

This store, as the name implies, contains bits of pop culture from both American and Japanese origins. It has vintage clothing, unique graphic t shirts, and cute accessories for Japanese enthusiasts. My only complaint is that I wish they had more, the store is very small and leaves you wanting. Overall, the store is a must-see if you're in Little Tokyo!<//Review>

<review>Having been to no less than four Popkiller Second, I think this is my favorite one. Great, quality, interesting clothing at reasonable prices. Ok, so some of the stuff is very expensive, but a lot of it isn't. And it's even a great place for kids' clothing - T-shirts on sale for $6.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

One of my fiancés shirts that we bought here, shrunk a little so you might have to size up when buying your typical size even though it says %100 cotton. lots of cool artwork on t-shirts & stickers here.<//text>

<response>None<//response><text>Whooo! In complete agreeance with the woman at the Popkiller location a couple doors down from this one, "we kind of have a monopoly on clothes on this small block of stores". Although I prefer that location to this one, they've got some nice stuff here! Unfortunately, it's a bit expensive, and a bit small. But if you're looking for a niche item or two, Popkiller definitely scratches that itch. I think a bit more variety for men's clothing would be a great improvement, but a fun place to look around notwithstanding.<//text><time>1570149566872< /time><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNMQ8c9wRf_qnJhfnDvBMpbSXXVwga45FRSUsTU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures></record></dataset><record>

I received the most amazing customer service I have EVER experienced from any business I have ever been to.

This cute little shop has a little bit of everything ANY tourist is in search of. If I could rate their prices, quality, uniqueness, and friendliness...well above 5 stars.</Text>< name>

<review>I looked but didn't find anything worth all the hype. Considering how many times Popkiller Second is mentioned on 'cool stuff' store lists, it was a total letdown.  The place is small, crowded and nothing very special.

What I bought was not vintage but absolutely cute and cool: two cat purses.< /review>< username>

Cool little shop.  I've been here eight nine years ago and it seemed a little more fun. They've since closed the second floor or upstairs. And the shop while it carries meets little knickknacks and Novelty items and some simple clothing it's lost it's polish if you ask me. Located in the heart of little Japan in Los Angeles.  Come here just to be here. But it's not a destination or tourist spot.< /Text>

Do you like a lot of fun crazy crap? Then this is the place for you! It's a cool little store to visit if you happen to be in the Japanese Village Plaza in Lil Tokyo. This is where I got my tin of emergency googly eyes, and boy, not a moment too soon--who knew there could be so many googly eyes-related emergencies? They also have a selection of vintage clothes that's fun to browser through. The operative word here is definitely fun!<//Review>

But the reason Popkillers is so great is their customer service. Today, I bought a pair of sunglasses there. As I walked out the door, they fell out of my bag and shattered.

Wow! The level of incompetency at this place is hard to describe, let's just say it's astronomical. Although the lovely gentleman who did not help me apologized for my "frustration" he really should have apologized for the dealership's incompetency. I'm sorry you are incapable of running a business. But good luck with everything!< /review>

bought a certified mini (countryman 2018) 2 months ago. Check engine light just went off for the 4th time.  Boy,  I really regret buying this mini!!!!.   been taking it to east bay mini to evaluate.  They are very professional but the repeat issue tells me it is the car and not the dealer.  I reached out to my salesman from concord mini.... crickets.   May be heading to Honda soon.  So depressing< /review>

Looking for a new car about a year ago, MINI entered the discussion. Watched Doug DeMuro's review of the 2019 Countryman ("Better than you think!") Entranced by the interior aesthetics, started taking test drives around south bay dealerships and was not disappointed. Started chatting with Michael Chavez at Concord MINI and made the drive, totally worth it, he and Sergei were great and I ended up purchasing that day. It's been 9 months and the car is amazing, I smile every time I get in. Driving less during shelter-in-place, so when I do, it's sport mode, every time :)<//Text>

< Review>
Brought my car in there for service on a Monday and they told me they were closed on Mondays because they don't generate enough service business to open the service center. So I came back on Tuesday and they told me that I needed an appointment because they're too busy since San Francisco Mini closed they are taking in all of their service.  I said fine can I leave my car there and you guys can get to it throughout the week when you can. They said sure we can do that and then they asked if I needed a ride somewhere and they would provide a ride. I asked if they had any loaner vehicles and they said no they are all out right now. I asked him how many loaner vehicles they had and they said about 20.  But apparently they aren't busy enough to be open Mondays. I told them I needed my car looked at because it failed smog and they told me the diagnostics would cost $410. I asked if that could be attributed to the repairs and they said no the diagnostics is a separate cost. I got a call the next day and they tell me that they repairs on my car are going to cost $2,900 plus the diagnostic charge of $410. I decline the repairs and rode my bike over and said I just want to take the car and I'll get a second opinion and they said it won't be ready till this afternoon to be picked up when I was there now at the Mini dealership after having rode my bike 4 miles there to pick it up.  He did say he would go and see if he can get it ready and it was ready to go in only 5 minutes. So that I appreciated!! But I felt like I had to persuade him like I bothered him to ask if it could be made sooner.   I really don't feel well treated here!  I'm from LA and the service center and MINI dealership in Torrance by my house was fantastic compared to this dealership.  They always had a loaner vehicle for me when my car was being serviced and they never told me that the service center is closed due to lack of business. They treated me WELL and always took care of me! Not impressed at all Mini if Concord!!!!!!</Review>

NOT impressed  at all with this dealership! called dealership for DMTL service which  has a 10yr/120k warranty (which my countrymen fell within). after leaving car at dealership and picking up loaner, received call saying 'based my vin # repairs are not covered'. concord mini refused to hornor mini campaign  warrenty extension..Jacob in service and his 'manager' Rafalle are perfect examples of what's wrong with car dealerships..< /text>

<Review>Service Department.
My long-standing mechanic ran the diagnostic on my Mini and told me what was wrong and why an engine light was on. He recommended I go to the dealer for the repair.

I contacted another independent Mini garage for a second opinion. I learned that there was a factory warranty extension on the part that diagnosis #1 showed as failing. (high pressure fuel pump)

With reluctance this second source said go to Mini as it is a warranted repair. I told this garage that my first choice mechanic had reset the 'lights'. She told me that the computer in my car still retained the 'event' and that it would be found.

I went to Mini of Concord. I had to wait a week for am appointment that provided me with a loaner car. There are no repairs while you wait, even if it is only the $205 diagnosis. In on Thursday with the promise of an answer the following Tuesday. You read that right.

Mid afternoon the following Tuesday I received a call from the service rep that my car needed new plugs and the fuel injectors cleaned. $600. No mention of the high pressure fuel pump that was originally ferreted out by one source and confirmed to be problematic and warranty work by the second source.

I asked if the technician looked at the print-out I had brought indicating the problem was a fuel pump and was told the plugs and the injector cleaning were all that was needed.

The plugs were less than three months old. Factory equipment. Installed elsewhere when I had the car in for a scheduled service.

The service rep minimized the fuel injector clean out, likening it to a can of over the counter clean-out product and that the entire service wouldn't take that much longer. $600 and not the real problem.

Mini of Concord did not want to dedicate the time on their analysis equipment to 'reach deeper' into my car's computer. They are inundated with business since the closing of a nearby Mini dealership. They are ill-prepared with an overworked staff and wonderfully, overbooked for tons of future work.

The problem I wanted repaired remains unaddressed and according to  Mini of Concord they have no way of confirming the problem is real despite the independent print out I provided and ignoring the question as to their full, in-depth analysis capabilities.

I hope when this problem resurfaces and the engine goes to half-power as it is programmed to do, my family and I are not placed in peril. I no longer trust Mini of Concord< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x808566da2c1e0d1d:0x8c575885a1ea75d6<//gmap_id></record>

I fell on love with a car there. My dream car!... the staff however was not eager enough to put me in a car. Didn't seem to care enough weather or not I wanted to buy a car or not. Guess I will be looking for my dream car somewhere where my business is appreciated...<//Text>

ASK FOR MICHAEL CHAVEZ!
Buying a car is stressful and takes long hours as everyone knows, but with Michael's professionalism, friendliness, responsiveness, and attentiveness, I had a wonderful experience. He has been working there for more than 15 years. He is so knowledgeable, and he can answer any questions. I could tell his passion about Mini Cooper and he owns one too. He is genuinely a caring person with wonderful sense of humor which helps for having a good experience.
Thanks so much Michael for helping me and making one of my longing dreams come true. I finally got my MINI Cooper Convertible Sport Package!
I LOVE MY CAR! I ENJOY DRIVING AND CURSING IT! WHAT A FANTASTIC CAR WITH GREAT PERFORMANCE.......
THANKS SO MUCH MICHAEL CHAVEZ FOR MAKING IT POSSIBLE WITH YOUR PROFESSIONALISM, KINDNESS, AND CLASS!!<//Review>

Really bad experience with this dealer, I was going to buy the car based on the description they sent me. Luckly I realized that the actual car didn't have the stuff from the description. They were not willing to add the stuff to the car or lower the price. Don't trust the website description or "contactless" treatment.<//Text>

<text>We worked with Jason on the purchase of our new Mini Cooper. It was the fastest and easiest car deal I’ve ever experienced. We negotiated a price over text over a few days time. Got right to the point on the price. Once we agreed upon a price, we completed the credit app online and spent a total of 20 minutes in the dealership to complete the purchase. The drive to Concord took 6x longer than the actual time we spent at the dealership. Real happy with the price we paid and the ease of the purchase.< /text><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x808566da2c1e0d1d:0x8c575885a1ea75d6< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Way overpriced. Wanted to charge me $500 to replace the timing chain tensioner because it was leaking oil. The reason it was leaking oil is because it was loose. I didn't approve the repair and did it myself. It took under 30 minutes with a Leatherman and a 27MM wrench. Retail list price for the part is $72.58 and if memory serves, the line item for the part on the quote was nearly double that. This is why dealership service shops have the reputation they have. The reason for 2 stars instead of one was because customer service was good.</Text>

We had a small snafu with our mini and Brian was very helpful. We know that he really went the extra mile to make sure the problem was completely handled and is always super friendly and very thorough. Getting a loaner or using the shuttle service is very easy and buying a car here comes with a lot of extra perks.</Text>

Butch was an awesome salesman. He was friendly, energetic and efficient. After the sale was complete he took care of things that add the extra personal touch like placing a large red bow on my new cute little mini, than took several pics of me and my new addition. Everyone in the store was super friendly. There like one big happy family. Thanks Butch and the rest if the mini family!<//review>

Literally just left here. Walked around the lot and no rep acknowledge or said hello. Knew the type of car I wanted from online. I walked in and with over a dozen employees and nothing. Not a friendly atmosphere. Highly unprofessional. I do not recommend taking your business here. I will go down the street. Experience and first impression is important. Don’t waste your time here.< /Text>

Terrible Customer Service, Oil change and tune up took 7 hours to complete. They stated they cleaned the car, and it looked like nothing was even done. Id rather make the drive out to a farther mini cooper then ever come back here.<//review>

<Text>I went into Mini Cooper of Concord about a month ago and had the best car experience a girl could ask for. Sergei Beloi (sales manager) was so welcoming! It was a very busy day there at Mini, Sergei made sure I was taken care of and put me in very good hands. Mark Wilson made sure I walked out of that dealership with the perfect mini. He made sure I test drove all the models I was interested in and I felt no pressure or was I rushed at all. If you're reading this Mark you get an A+! (I'm also a teacher) Thank you so much Mini of Concord so happy I chose to make the drive to Concord instead of going to Mini of Mountain View.< /Text>< gmap_id>

<Review>Marcel Morlino is outstanding!!
I have a 2015 Mini Hardtop. I took it on Feb 6, 2017 for its 2-year maintenance, and I had superb customer service!
Marcel helped me right away, and he was just great, very courteous and efficient, reviewed all my information quickly, listened to all I had to say, and took great care of my baby!
He was also the service advisor who helped me last year, and he was just as nice then!
I was given a loaner Mini while my car was being serviced, which was a great opportunity to test the new model. I had my car back that afternoon, free of charge. My Mini is set until next year!
Thanks Mini of Concord, you guys are like family :D< /Review></record>

Great experience all around!

We had a not so great experience with another Mini dealership, who shall not be named, and went to Mini of Concord with some reservations.  However, from the moment I contacted them, before they even opened, Jason had won me over with his responsiveness and friendliness.  The used vehicle I wanted wasn't even on the lot when I called (it was still being cleaned), but Jason ensured that by the time my husband and I made the hour drive to Concord, it was at a stage where we could test drive it.  Jason made the negotiation part a breeze (really because they have things priced so well!) and Alyce made all of the "fun" financing process literally fun.  Our little Mini had to go back for some additional work the next day, so we dealt with Shane, who was a pleasure to work with as well.  They even drove to Tracy, dropped off a loaner and brought the car back when it was ready.  Such service!!  Thank you, team!!< /Text>

Never get your car serviced here--they wanted to charge me $180 for something an independent shop did in 5 minutes for free (they said it was too easy, they didn't feel right charging me for it.) The work was programming a new key for a Mini.

Avoid getting scammed and overcharged, take your car to an independent shop, even for new key programming.<//Review>

<response>None< /response><review>Best car shopping experience. Jason Krupa was solid and professional. He helped me to locate the car, offered the most competitive price among all of  other dealerships on my list without any drama, and got me pre-approved on desired financial terms without needing to bother me on the phone a single time. He replied my email questions with simple, solid answers so I did not waste any time. My actual time spent at the dealership was less than 30 min. Highly recommended if you are looking for a new or used Mini in the Bay Area !</review>< GmapID>

<Review>We had a wonderful experience at MINI of Concord thanks to Butch Madayag. Butch was incredibly friendly, helpful and relaxed. He let us guide ourselves toward the car we wanted, and once we found it, he worked with us to shape the deal that worked best for us. We've been around shady car dealers in the past. And Butch was a welcome antidote to all of those bad memories. I cannot more highly recommend a dealer.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x808566da2c1e0d1d:0x8c575885a1ea75d6< /gmapID></record>

I just got my new special ordered mini copper S there and I am very happy with the services and price I got. Jason is absolutely great!!
I lived in mountain View, so Concord is more than an hour drive for me, but I still think it is way worth it to buy from there. I had looked for mini from couple other dealers closer to my area, they all gave me a lot of pressure in buying. Then I found Jason, communicated with him through phone and emails, he gave me good advice, offered me a price much better than the other mini dealers offered me and the purchasing process was smooth with no problem.
When I picked up my car,  Jason is very knowledgable, he told me all the details about the car.
And he even followup few days after I picked up the car and see how I was doing with it.
Best experience I ever had with a car sales. I will definitely come back in the future.<//text>< pics>

<Text>Wow, I see plenty of other people have good things to say about Jason Krupa.  With very good reason.

I'm an Oregonian & asked a couple questions about purchasing from out-of-state via email.  He responded immediately and said even though they sold the specific car I'd emailed about, they would honor the same price on a similar vehicle.  I ended up not buying a car--any car--this spring but these guys will be the first email I send in the fall when I'm fully ready.< /Text><date>1274061918877<//date>< pictures>

Decided to buy a car one day, went online and found a couple in the bay area that I liked, emailed Jason Krupa at MINI of Concord, he replied like at midnight on a Sunday. On Monday, his day off he was emailing and calling and handing us off to another colleague Butch Madayag. Gave us a great deal. Together they provided exceptional and speedy customer service. We drove home with a mini that afternoon less than 24 hours after I decided I wanted to buy a car.< /Review>

<text>I purchased Mini Countryman from Jason Krupa. He was honest, respectful and I felt zero pressure to rush my decision. Jason was very responsive to my many emails and phone calls. We had most of the deal mapped out before I even set foot in the dealership. Once I sat down with him face-to-face our arrangement did not change except to further accommodate my needs. Not once did he leave me in the office to sweat me out or "forget" what we had discussed. It was the least combative car buying experience I've ever had and I've had a few! I think I was only there about an hour before I was zipping off in my new cutie. I am a hairstylist and when I was speaking to my client (another Mini owner) about my car, she launched into a glowing review of her salesperson. Guess who it was?</text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None< /Response></record>

Scott Sills, Service Manager of Mini Cooper, Concord, California is one of the best, most honest, most capable Service Mgr I ever encountered! After  MY daughter's car was serviced I noticed a chrome molding was missing from the car hood, so I returned it and brought it to their attention. He took care of it fair and square! I HIGHLY RECOMMNED HIM and Mini Cooper Service Dept in Concord, CA for a job well done everytime!</review>

<Review>I was a Mazda owner and got my first Mini in April (from another branch). I have came to this Concord branch twice already since my work is close to here, but both times didn't end up getting anything done. The people here lack motivation to work; really bad customer service, basically none because both times I was directed somewhere else or they can't get me a loaner till 10 days later.
Updated: So I went home and check online to see when a loaner is available, they actually have it available 4 days later but the person who help me told me 10 days later. To me, he clearly didn't want to work.<//Review>< Pics>

Michael Chavez hooked up us with a trade in our newer car and even gave us a loaner overnight!  We weren't expecting to even buy a car that night, but Michael and his boss Mr Sergei Beloi (sales manager) had us ready to go and out the door the next day!< /Review>< Response>

Review of Mini of Concord and Jason Krupa

Jason was very knowledgeable about the car we were interested in. He came in early to meet with us as we had a tight schedule to test drive the vehicle and complete all the paperwork and catch a plane that afternoon.< /Text>

<Time>1435350076798< /Time><Text>My husband and I had been looking for a mini for me to replace my miata that got totaled for about 1 month. After a bad buy with a private party, we decided to go dealership route. My husband went to the SF dealership and they has what we wanted (older year Mini Cooper, hardtop S with low miles) but it wasn't on the lot yet. So we visited the Concord one. When we arrived on the lot someone immediately noticed us looking around and asked if we needed help, we did so they sent out a sales person. In comes Michael Chaves. We asked if they had anything like we were looking for. Turns out they had a lease return with less than 20,000 miles in great condition. But we weren't looking for something that new. (the one in SF was a 2002). We opted to check it out anyways. Michael was VERY knowledgeable about the cars. My husband (who drives and works on race cars) knew exactly what he wanted for me and Michael had answers. He even knew how much the car weighed when I asked, no hesitation. (I like light little cars, hence the miata before).  Michael did not pressure us, the car we were looking at was slated to be a CPO but hadn't been completed yet so it wasn't amazing looking. He explained what they do, what a CPO is, etc. We left without feeling like we were violated and tasked to think about it.

We discussed and my husband agreed I could get what I wanted, either the 2002 or the 2012. I hemmed and hawed up until the day we were scheduled to go in and buy. I felt if I didn't get the newer one, I would regret it. So I went with the 2012. Michael was ready for us, and so was the car (my baby car 2.0) when we arrived on Friday night. We test drove it (not necessary but fun) and then settled to agree on the terms. I had a concern that there was damage to the front bumper that hadn't been repaired. For my husband, this was a bargaining tool. In the end, we paid a price we were comfortable with AND they agreed to repair the bumper. Jason, who assisted with the sale was nice as well.

When they went to do the contract, there were others ahead of us and the wait was about an hour. We were able to leave and get dinner and come back when they were ready for us. I cannot remember the women who helped us with the contract but she was good also. After that was done, Michael gave me my keys (complete with Mini key chain!) and spent time showing me the features of the car. I really appreciated this since I am not use to a European car and some things were different, it helped a lot.

I read all the reviews on this dealer before going but I was set on this car and in the end, Michael was GREAT. The process was so smooth and he really made it easy without pressuring us. I would highly recommend this dealer and Michael if you are EVER looking for a Mini. I love my Mini Cooper!< /Text>< Pics>

<review>This was my first time buying a car, and Butch changed all my preconceptions of the 'slick' care salesman.

From the initial online inquiry into a pre-owned Mini, Butch was very transparent in what was available - providing detailed specs of all the pre-owned Minis. This was important to me as other salesmen who were closer to San Francisco played coy and gave vague details, all in hopes of getting someone into the dealership.

Once my girlfriend & I arrived at the dealership, Butch was very attentive as to what we were looking for - and didn't steer us to the more expensive option (as an aside, Mini Concord a great selection of pre-owned Countrymen in the B.A.).

In the end, we had a choice of two pre-owned cars with the options we were looking for. Throughout the process, Butch was helpful - he encouraged us to really test-drive both models and helped us get the best deal & financing.  And after the sale, he followed up with phone calls to see if we had any questions or issues with our purchase.

I would highly recommend Butch to anyone looking for a Mini - new or pre-owned.< /review>< Pictures>

< Review>
This store has a great meat market and deli sandwiches. It's a great place for quick stop's, run and grab a beer and munchies or a few groceries for tonight's dinner. Everyone here is always super nice and very helpful. They are also a proud sponsor of our high school football team, the Sutter Huskies!<//Review>

<Text>This market is a gem !  It is a great place to get hot fried chicken, as well as a variety of ready to eat items, fresh cut up fruit, potato & macaroni salads, etc.  They have the highest quality meats around, with very competitive  prices.  They also make sandwiches to order.  This store carries all the products you could need, saving you the 10 mile drive into Yuba City.  The staff are friendly and professional.  South Butte Market is very clean and the food is very fresh.  Next time you pass through Sutter, be sure to stop and see for yourself!<//Text>< Pictures>

Good when you are in a bind and can't or don't want to drive into town. Prices are high. Most times I've gone in there, employees are rude and/or patronizing. Have a MoneyGram setup but it's always down. Produce is terrible. Haven't tried the meat but it's pricey. But if you just need some milk and are willing to pay $$$ a gallon. Go for it.<//text>

<review>Clean with friendly staff. Prices are high compared to other stores of similar size. But very convient as it is one of 2 stores in Sutter proper that sell Local market items. Everything you would expect to find. NOT a mini Mart store.< /review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

< Review>
First time visit this hotpot restaurant for Mother's Day Dinner.

Had reservation day before arrival, we arrived on time and was greeted for sitting soon upon arrival.

Great service by our wait staff. The dishes we order are fresh meat, vegetables, tofu. I believe all hotpot place taste almost the same, the key is the freshness of produce.

We had a good time and good food.

Recommend this place and will come back to visit again.<//Review>

Good atmosphere in the interior. Fresh vegetables and meat for hot pot, and there can be four spots for the broth choices. They offer fruits at the sauce & seasoning station as well as a chocolate fountain machine. Some amenities are available such as phone chargers on the flat surface of your table.<//Review>

This will be my favorite hotpot place!! They are so high-tech that they have a robot bringing food! They have so many choices from different meat to huge selections of seafood and veggies! Lobster ball with cheese are sooo good!! They have indoor and outdoor options and tables are equipped with wireless charging and water holder.. they accommodate 1 person dine-in. They place a stuff animal to keep company.  Love this place! Bathroom has toothbrush. mouth wash, dental floss, and lotions.<//Text>

The food was good and service as well considering how busy they were and shirt staff due to Mother's day. The robot server was annoying to the customers and the waiters. The one super flaw is the long lines for the sauces and desserts. I would come again.</Text>

< Review>
Me and my friends went to there last night. Everything was good, but the waiter has very bad manner. Waiter’s name is Zhang Xing.

First, we payed in cash and he counted money. He came back with very bad manner. He threw the money on the table and said we did not give enough tips. He showed all his angry to us and pointed on the receipt so strong. We did not feel too good. We probably had mistake to count cash, but he could just tell us “Hi Sir, you missed some cash here.”

His manner is too bad and I don’t think he could be a good waiter here.<//Review>

<Review>Food and staff were great all around. The problem is they have too many cameras looking, literally pointing at your face no matter where you sit, and that is very uncomfortable. I suspect they are using this for the evilness more than to improve services. No come back to this and all the franchise again for sure. Privacy is very important so only 2 stars for this review. The food and staff would get 5 stars if it wasn't for the cameras.<//Review></record>

<Text>The food was served quickly at the beginning. But the long line to get the sauce was annoying and everyone was using the same spoon. Social distance is a joke. Other hot pot restaurants I went have sauces prepared in small containers.

We ordered second round of food and the kitchen was too busy to prepare it.</Text>< Rate>

One of the best hotpot place in the bay.
You can get up to four flavors for the hotpot.
Their waiting area got board games, water, and snacks.
Go there earlier otherwise you might need to spend 30-45min to wait.
The service is as good as their restaurants that I’ve been to in mainland China. Super friendly and informative.<//Review>

I was there on my birthday. The staff was very sweet they gather together to singing the birthday song for me. There is a small cake they provide for me. The service is fantastic. Yao know I like the drink. He made me another one. And Nana ask me how was everything. And I told her I like everything but the fries Szechuan pork is different than last couples of time I had it. She makes sure get my feedback. And know what’s wrong with the dish. So they can improve. And they make a new one for me. It was good. This place known for their service in China. And I not surprise why. I would like to stop one in China and see if what is like.</review>

< Review>
They packed our cabbages in plastic bags. And all of the food (over 10 items and two cups of tea) in one single paper bag. It got broken because of the weight and the leaky drinks immediately after we walked to our car and started the engine. The whole inside of the car was polluted. It was a disaster. Not to mention that they had us waited for more than 30 minutes after it notified us that the food is ready for pickup. The service is so poor compared to the Cupertino store and it completely ruined the brand we love. Do not pickup from this store if you don’t want to have your car washed for the next few hours and end up with nothing to drink.  Drive ten miles more to the Cupertino store or go elsewhere for your car’s sake.<//Review>

Our kids enjoyed the food and they have egg/dairy allergy friendly options. We choose 4 different soup bases, one was spicy, there was no mixture of the bases since we kept the spicy base closer to the adults and used a separate ladle. There are many high quality meats, seafood, vegetables and types of tofu to close from. This is now on my list of go-to's when we decide to go out for dinner.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

Haidilao is popular for their services. However, this store is exceptional. No water services. I have to find glasses and refill on my own during the entire meal. Waiter and waitress are reckless. If they want to take away empty dishes, they will do that several times while we are in a conversation. No soup refill for our hot pot entire time. We sit by the window with a street view. Waitress open and close the curtain several times without a notice. If I only want to eat hot pot, I have lots of choices. I choose haidilao because of their services, which disappoint me so much in this store. Not recommend eating in this haidilao store to anyone.< /review>

(Translated by Google) Although the service attitude has always been very good 👍 Unfortunately, there are some sections that are disgusting! 🤮🤮🤮
Last week, I learned that Haidilaotang was open, so I immediately went to Da Kuai Duoer with my friends. After I ordered the food, I went to the toilet. It happened that my aunt was cleaning and hygienic. I thought that Haidilao's hygiene was not bad, and someone cleaned it regularly. After going to the toilet, I put on my gloves and went to the counter to pick up sauces and snacks. Suddenly, I found an aunt was adding bowls and changing the snacks. Then I looked at it clearly. Isn't this the aunt who was in the toilet just now? ! She just cleaned the toilet and walked directly to add bowls without changing her gloves? No change of gloves! ! 🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮 My appetite was completely gone at that time, should the toilet flusher manage the small table part-time? I don’t know if I still need to cut vegetables! Is Haidilao really unable to wash the toilet and clean the staff only responsible for all the hygiene in the store? Is it worth saving a little money and breaking the name of Haidilao? My friends and I were very uncomfortable that day. We rushed over and paid the bill and left. We hope that Haidilao's management can arrange the staff well and don't lose too much!

我上周得知海底撈堂吃已開，立即和朋友們去大快朶兒。點好菜後，我上廁所去，剛好阿姨在清潔衛生，心想海底撈的衛生還算可以，定時有人清潔。如廁後我便戴好手套到小料枱上拿醬料及小吃，忽然發現有一阿姨正在加碗及更換小料，再看清楚，這不是剛才在廁所清潔衛生的阿姨嗎？！她剛剛打掃完廁所就直接走來加碗，沒有換手套？沒有換手套！！🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮我當時的食慾全消，難道洗馬桶的要兼職管理小料枱嗎？不知道還要否切菜呢！海底撈真的不能夠把洗馬桶、打掃衛生的員工只負責店內的所有衛生嗎？省一點點錢，把海底撈的大名打壞了，值得嗎？我和朋友們當天非常地不舒服，我們草草的結束了買單離開，希望海底撈管理層能好好安排人手，不要因小失大！<//Text>

(Translated by Google) POSSIBLE HEALTH CODE VIOLATION*********
They are open for indoor dining but not doing any distancing. WHAT?!
when questioned, the manager or hostess tried so hard to be clever and came up with bs reason why they are not following COVID guideline. Took a picture for evidence, definitely reporting this restaurant to the Food safety DEPT for shirking COVID rule.

The service of Fremont Haidilao has been poor. During the epidemic, in order to save labor costs, all the diners were seated on the side of the restaurant. Table after table was packed, and there was no social distancing.

Q: Can you sit further away?
Answer: No, because there is not enough manpower.
Question: Does this crowding meet government regulations?
Answer: The government only says that the overall indoor %capacity is reduced.
Did not say that it is not required to be close.

Is there any conscience? ?
Everyone is here to eat, not to play with the virus. This kind of rhetoric is disgusting enough!

Fremont海底捞服务一直差就不说了，疫情期间为了节省人力成本让食客全部都坐到餐厅一侧，一桌连一桌挤得满满的， 完全不存在social distancing。

问：能不能坐远一点的位置？
答：不可以，因为人手不够。
问：这样人挤人符合政府规定吗？
答： 政府只说整体室内%capacity降低就可以了，
没说不规定离得近。

有没有点良知啊？？
大家是来吃饭的，不是来和病毒玩的，这种说辞有够恶心的！< /text>

(Translated by Google) The service is particularly poor. It is far worse than the service during the epidemic. I use plastic bags for packaging, and I use bags for other people. The checkout receipt was sent to me before I finished eating. Is there a time limit for eating here? Between 4-5 pm on April 9th, he was a tall but not fat male waiter!

服务特别差，比疫情期间的服务差远了，打包直接用塑料袋，给别人打包用盒我用袋，还没吃完结账收据给我送过来了，在这吃饭有时间限制吗？4月9日下午4-5点之间，是一个高高不胖的男服务员！</Text>

Big thank you to Shaun. He was very informative in helping me choose what device, juice, batteries, and nicotine I should go with. Very good selection of juice and vapes to choose from. I checked the time to see when they open and the door was open 1 minute early. That might not mean much to some but huge plus for me. I definitely found my local favorite shop!< /Review>

<Review>Absolutely the most friendly helpful place I have been to! I can call ahead to and they get my order ready for me and they absolutely take care of you with a smile under their masks! They are the reason I haven’t gone back to smoking and I stay on the Vape! Highly recommend this business to everyone!<//Review><Response>None</Response><Name>Trisha Redenius<//Name><Rate>5< /Rate>< user_id>

The employees have vast knowledge about their trade and are extremely helpful. The pricing is some of the best in town and if they don't have it they'll get it or make an equivalent.  One of the employees always remembers what I like and is always recommending new things. This is the only place I go for juice, or coils. Speaking of which their selection of tanks and coils is wide and of good quality. If you're not shopping here you're missing out.<//text>

<text>I knew nothing about vaping when I first came to Vapor Invasion. They took the time to explain and show me how all the different batteries worked, let me sample the different juices until I found the ones I liked. The staff is AMAZING! I won't go to any other vape shop because I found the best in the business!</text>< Pictures>

Great customer service. Product that I had bought a couple months ago was giving me problems and even though I only mentioned it casually, I was given another one. Come support these guys they care.</Text>

Awesome selection of salt and glycerin. If they have a flavor you want in salt but not glycerin (or the other way around) they can convert it! Absolute vape wizards.</text>

<review>Jodi  and James are always super helpful. They can pretty much answer any and all questions you have and set you up with the perfect vape tank cambo or pod to use. They have new products almost every time we go in and they are priced very nicely. I would definitely recommend this place!</review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

It's a clean shop I will give em that, but the fact that veterans don't get anything for a discount is bogus. It's stellar that active duty gets 20% it really is, but screw the rest of us that have already gone through, UN-AMERICAN! My wife and I will not be returning. Their shop is only in the land of vets and active duty. Think about it.</text>

The arrogance of the staff was something I overlooked but I bought a battery set for a Christmas present that upon opening we found that it wasn't threaded so could not attach the tank. I called and was told to just bring it in and exchange it. Upon doing so I was told that their system doesn't have record of me purchasing this battery but it does have record of the THREE SETS I purchased in October. They refused to exchange the defective battery. I have purchased a total of 5 battery sets since arriving in SD four months ago for my husband and I. I would like to think I  am a loyal customer but since the rude attitude is not something I will overlook after being stuck with THEIR defective battery, I will never shop here again and I would recommend to any one to stay away from this place!</text>

<Review>Excellent place to hang out, vape, and socialize! Jeff, James, Carlos, Pop and Jody are great! Lots of juices to select from, and plenty of hardware for all your needs. They take the time to explain all of the options for mech, and will walk you through putting together your new purchase of hardware. Great place for new vapers!<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

Quality mods and atomizers.
Quality juices - Tasty house flavors and luxury outside brands.
Quality staff - Knowledgeable, friendly, fast, entertaining, and generous
Reasonable prices - 'Nuff said
Customer reward system is looser than your mom with freebies and discounts. (hint: buy larger juice bottles so the computer "misses you" when you stay away and it tosses you bigger discounts.)
COMFY vape lounge with leather sofas, tv, drinks and coffee.

All in all, a damned fine Vape supply store</Text>

These guys are the only shop in San Diego that aren't trying to take advantage of people. I've found the same mods at other stores for double the price or more. My favorite store by miles!!!</Review>

They told me the battery pack I bought had a year warranty. A few months go by and of course it stops working. I call them and ask how to get a replacement. Oh those don't have a warranty. Thanks. Internet here I come.<//review>

< review>
Yamato is pretty good. It is a little over priced for sushi that is only pretty good. From the outside, it looks like it will be a fancy place, but once you get inside, it is a little rundown. There are patches in the seats and the lighting is kind of strange. There are good happy hour deals, so as long as you can get there during happy hour, it is worth the price. The location is maybe the best part of Yamato. It is in a good place for UCLA students and a good place to go for sake bombs, especially if you live close by and want to walk home. The best way to describe Yamato is "pretty good". Not "excellent" not "awful"... it's pretty good. I would recommend going with friends, it is not the type of place I would go to get take out sushi or eat alone.<//review>

<text>Sushi Lovers Rejoice!!!
This was my first experience with sushi here in the US and I was not disappointed. It was a Wednesday night and it was jam-packed, so I highly recommend calling in advance to confirm seating if possible.
The establishment was spacious, with 2 floors and we didn't feel cramped-up at all. Surprisingly, although it was crowded and busy, the service was timely and prompt.
The food was superb and I ordered several sushi platters, as well as a main dish. Food preparation was fantastic, flavorful and there was never a bland moment. I hardly even used soy sauce, but dipped into some eel sauce for flair. They also have an extensive bar for drinks.
Overall, this is truly a sushi haven in the area and I definitely recommend it to all!</text><rating>5<//rating><userid>103766561348092093664< /userid>< resp>

< Review>
Yamato is a Westwood staple, the grandiose entrance beckons patrons to partake in the wonderfully inexpensive sushi and sake.

This place brings back so many memories of my college days, when my pockets had more lint than dollar bills and my hankering for sushi first started to blossom. I came here and still frequent this place for their tasty crunchy rolls and crispy shrimp rolls both only costing you a mere six bucks! The sushi here is very scant with the rice portions and generous with the filling so you won't get full too fast off of carbs. Also the sushi here is always tasty! You really can't go wrong.

Besides the inexpensive sushi Yamato has really great service. During lunch they tend to be a bit slower but it's more than enough time to take on your lunch break without going over. The wait staff is friendly and courteous, always chipper to help.

Finally the best part about this place is the ambiance. It's really cute but not too pretentious. It's great for a date or just to grab drinks with your friends. Either way it sticks out in Westwood as a place you can take a girl where she can still get cute without you breaking the bank.< /Review>

<review>Sushi is not my thing but a friend brought me here because she "loves" this place. I know that Sushi must taste better than this elsewhere. This place was very busy, so you might find it a better fit for you than I did. Poor.< /review><userid>116197501261495988080< /userid>< pics>

<text>Hostess is horribly rude. Waiters are nice and fine. I went this place before, and she misunderstood my order and blamed me. She said like "How do I understand your order?" She is an asian women with black and short hair. We requested for a cup of water, but she ignored our request. We spent 20 dollars for food, but could not even drink water...</text>< Pics>

<review>Great food and great prices... the only thing that I did not like was that they bring the food extremely fast to your table! You order a roll and it's on your table in 2 minutes... it does not give you time to talk with the people you're eating.</review>< pictures>

I guess if you're in Westwood and want sushi, this is a better alternative to...wait, what other sushi place is there in Westwood?  Instead of coming here, you should just get a beer at Brew Co before they close it. And if you're reading this and Brew Co is already closed, go eat at Boiling Crab!! Yum.<//review>

This is where I got my sushi fix back during the UCLA days. Only come during happy hour because that's the only time it is worth it. The exterior looks so fancy you almost don't want to go in and then you see the inside and it's just amazing. I think they were going for Grecian? Definitely not your typical sushi restaurant. They have outdoor space for large groups, intimate nooks for romantic dates, or you can come with a few friends and do some sake bombs. No matter the occasion it can be down right at Yamato.<//text>< response>

<review>I don't understand the negative reviews here. This is a great place, and you can't beat the prices. I go here regularly for business meetings, and I suggest the luncheon specials. You get a ridiculous amount of food for $8.95. I always order the Chicken Teriyaki...salad, miso soup, and tons of chicken and rice. Where else can you find a bargain like this with good food and excellent ambience in L.A.? I never had any problem with the service. The hosts, and the servers were excellent...free two hour parking next door...and no, I don't work there...lol!<//review><Gmap_id>0x80c2bc818053c203:0xc0be6876aabc5be< /Gmap_id>< UserId.>

She also seems to hire people like her because the servers don't understand much English either. They have bad manners, probably because they're clueless, and it takes 5 times to get them to understand something.
My roommate went to eat there three times, and every SINGLE time, her food came after everyone else was done eating. I went there once, met the terrible owner, and will never go again.
This is all coming from an Asian--I have sympathy for fobs, but not in this case. Learn some American etiquette, and the language for goodness' sake.</text><gmapID>0x80c2bc818053c203:0xc0be6876aabc5be< /gmapID>< time>

<Text>Westwood location- This place had a great atmosphere with good food at a good price. Two negatives though... service was horrible! Had to eat our soup with no spoon and our salads with no fork even after asking for them. I also had to finish my meal without a refill because our waitress didnt come back until we looked like we needed a check. Another thing is that my friends and I decided on eating there because of the huge happy hour sign outside that said 5-close... they stopped happy hour at 930 and they closed at 11...
Other then those two small things, this place was great...</Text>< UserId.>

<rating>4</rating><Text>One of my favorite Japanese restaurants in Westwood. Easy going but classy ambiance, helpful and friendly staff, decent food.

It's not extremely expensive, but it's also not cheap. It's a mid-high range friendly enough to go with your buddies, but high enough to have a business lunch.

Their Chirashi bowl is my favorite. Much more affordable than ordering Nigiri sushi here, with plenty of high quality sashimi with sushi rice, salad and miso. Presentation is also beautiful.< /Text>< Pics>

<review>I've come here multiple times since I first moved to the area. It's decent sushi if you're having a craving and don't want to drive to sawtelle. I definitely would not come here expecting extremely fresh and delicious raw fish. I think this place is better for cooked/baked sushi. I've had the opportunity to try many of their speciality sushi rolls, such as BSCR, Sandra, Rainbow, Dragon, etc. Of the ones I've tried, my favorites are BSCR and Sandra. I usually pay around $20 and that's with more than enough food for myself. Also, one thing I do like about Yamato is their interior decorations and high ceiling. This is definitely a good place if you're looking for a cheap date night place or a place that can accommodate a large group with short notice. Not being a huge sushi fan, I probably would only come here again if my friends took me. Otherwise, I probably wouldn't return.< /review><user>116567365561607587038< /user><Rating>3</Rating>< Date>

Let me preface this by saying that I'm a big fan of Ami sushi (the other sushi restaurant in Westwood). Today, however I wanted to go back to Yamato after not having gone for a while since I'm always hearing good things.

Called ahead and made a reservation for a party of 3. The reservation process went smoothly.

When we arrived at the restaurant (they hid the "B" rating by the way), the hostess spent 5 minutes trying to find our reservation (while the restaurant was 60% full). After she found our reservation, we were shown to our seats - a booth on the second floor overlooking the kitchen and the sake display. The floor was dirty and the upholstery on the booth was coming apart.

Our waiter, Michael, seemed ill prepared and in a hurry. We ordered tuna sashimi, a beef bowl, a pitcher of Sapporo, and several cut rolls - spicy tuna, california, avocado, pink.

The tuna sashimi was good, and I liked the beef bowl. The rice on all the rolls, however, was overcooked, and this didn't make for good rolls (in my opinion). The wait wasn't too long either, maybe 10 minutes before everything came out.

When I asked for regular soy sauce, the waiter responded with "Nah, with this being California and all the health conscious people and such..." Not looking good. I then asked for a fork, to which he responded "Hmm, we actually are running low on metal forks because there's a big party outside..is a plastic one okay?" We were rather clumsy tonight, and spilled several things, so we had to use many napkins to mop up our mess. Michael walked by each time and didn't offer to help out...I expected a little bit more. I'll give him credit though, when I asked for more ginger, he brought out a huge amount.

All in all, outdated decor, nice ambiance, okay food, not so good wait staff. I think that this place is alright, and it's priced on par with Ami (in my opinion) (all came out to ~$50). If you ask me though, I'd take Ami over Yamato in a heart beat, and today served as a testament to that. I would come back here if Ami wasn't around...but it is.< /Text>

The place where most people usually go for sushi when stuck in Westwood. They have Happy Hour from 5 PM until Closing where everything is 50% off, so its definitely one of the best deals for sushi. Yamato's is cheap, has a hip, modern setting, but lacks in quality of food.

Sometimes it takes forever to get seated even for a few people and when you can see empty tables. They once rejected my group even though closing wasn't for another 15 minutes, and I've heard that happened to other people as well. The service is below average, it sometimes takes forever to place orders, and the food comes out really fast a few times but usually takes forever.

Their sushi is okay. It's not bad, but it's not amazing either. Most of the appetizers like tuna tataki and onion albacore are good, but not amazing. Garlic edamame is good. I usually get sashimi, the albacore, tuna and unagi were good. I had toro (fatty tuna) once and it was good but I ordered it recently and it wasn't fresh at all and tasted disgusting.

This place gets 3/5 because of their value, modern and cool environment, and average sushi. It gets the job done of fulfilling a sushi craving.</Review>

(Translated by Google) Almost every sushi roll consisted for the most part of mixed Krabenstäbchen. Nothing for gourmets.

Stephen and Angelica were very professional and took care of my concerns. They were good at explaining the different types of bankruptcies and which one would work for me. They made the process simple and pretty much held my hand the whole entire way. Angelica was really good with following up throughout everything. She had good patience with me and was great with reminding me whenever something was needed on my end. They were always very responsive whenever I reached out. No complaints. I would definitely recommend them.< /text>

I appreciate the patience Angie has had with me as I have called her multiple times for different nonsense and endless questions. She has returned my calls in a timely manner and always with a happy tone. The times we've visited the office it has felt like family warmth.

Additionally, we have also been assisted by Terry due to a car accident. She was very diligent and on top of the case. Managed to get our damages paid even when the other person didn't have enough coverage.

** We our very grateful for everything you guys have done for us..<//review>< username>

Back in 2017, after reading the many positive reviews, my husband and I decided to contact  Stephen Kim at his office in Salinas.
We couldn't have been more satisfied with the very professional, and friendly service we recieved from Stephen, Angie, and their entire staff. Not just from the very beginning, but all the way through the process.
When we recently needed copies of our paperwork, all we needed to do was to contact Angie, and she sent them right out to us the same day.
I would highly recommend this office to anyone who is considering  bankruptcy, and needs some friendly, honest advice.</review>

Highly recommend this law office. The process was easier than I thought. As soon as a walked in I was greeted by Angelica Who is very professional and nice. The attorney Stephen Kim explained the process to me step by step with a free consultation. I filed bankruptcy at the beginning of the year and already received my first credit card offer.</review>

Having to talk to a lawyer is almost by definition, a very uncomfortable position to be in for most people. I recently saw myself in the need of legal help and the person I spoke to, seemed incredible aloof, distant and he didn’t really listen or look at all the moving parts in my predicament. He didn’t seem too bothered about my situation or really invested in helping me solve it, but he was very quick to ask for fees and upfront payment, while offering no real reassurance about a positive outcome. It was a crushing experience.

I came to Stephen for a second opinion, and the difference couldn’t have been more obvious. While talking to Stephen and Angelica, his wonderful assistant, I was very pleasantly surprised of how quickly they understood my situation, and the different components to it, but also, that these were very patient people with a great sense of empathy, which is extremely rare in the realm of professional services. These are people who care.

Not only did they offer me a variety of solutions, they also offered encouragement and, believe it or, actual emotional support. I left their office feeling I had solutions at hand and that I has regained control of my problems. That is what professional is for. To help people solve their problems, not leave you feeling burdened and numb. I really can’t thank Stephen and Angelica enough.< /text>

<Text>Stephen Kim is caring, compassionate and down to earth. The instant connection and comfort I felt with him, coupled with his easy manner, makes his services an oasis of calm as compared to any lawyer.  We’ve had two others in the last few years and the contrast in personal service is quite apparent.

I highly recommend Stephen’s services!!</Text><pics>None<//pics><resp>{'time': 1576710978844, 'text': 'Scotty!  Been missing you my man.  Thanks for the review.  It means a lot to us.'}</resp><GmapID>0x808df8ea4c3ed6bb:0xd51188574db054e2< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Steve Kim and Angelica have provided me with so much help with my chapter 7 bankruptcy.  I'm especially impressed at the excellent advice Steve gave me as I prepared for the filing.  He and his office are very thorough, have great attention to detail  and have kept me informed during this stressful time for me.  I can't say enough about how important it is to have a great attorney when filing for bankruptcy.

Thank you Steve for all your help and assistance.<//text>

<rate>5<//rate><Text>Not all Attorneys are alike! I found Stephen Kim after starting Ch13 with another local  attorney who refused to intervene when the bank filed a Relief of Stay request with the court.  We were in shock knowing we could lose our home!! I needed help fast!
Angelica took my call late on a Friday and Stephen called me back on a Saturday! Monday morning found me in their office surrounded by their kindness and concern. I left with such relief knowing they were handling my matters correctly.
Stephen and Angelica had the experience and  resources to guide us thru
the process with very little stress. I was always treated with warmth and  courtesy and  they were always able to address my concerns promptly.
They both are professionals with sensitive and caring hearts, committed
to helping their clients.
With their guidance, we were able to achieve a loan modification, (which I qualified for and submitted three times previously  but was rejected).
All Attorneys  are not alike! I will forever remain grateful for Stephen Kim and Angelica for they positively changed the course of my family's lives.
No question I give them the highest recommendation!</Text>< GmapID>

I highly recommend Mr Kim and Angelica to anyone that needs advice pertaining to what is often times scary and taxing on an individual. As many other users have claimed, Mr Kim takes the time to carefully listen to one's current circumstances and explains the legal choices one has in coherent understandable terms. He is an excellent attorney and it would behoove you  to contact his office if you are in need of a knowledgeable and competent attorney.<//Review>

Steven is an expert bankruptcy attorney.  The process was thorough, proficient and expeditious.  He and Angie made the experience far less intimidating than I had anticipated. The atmosphere was professional yet down to hearth and genuinely friendly. He was the right man for the job when I needed it and my time was running out with my tax delima. He knows his #%*^ and for that, I am grateful for the fresh start. Forget the rest, go straight to Steven Kim & get your life BACK!<//review>

We, the Osborne's found Stephen Kim through the angel that is  the face of his operation. Angelica is a blessing. She is friendly, sincere, professional.and bilingual. We knew that  if Angie is happy working with Stephen then we definitely have the right attorney. Stephen didn't disappoint us. He is a real person that has real solutions for you. He didn't talk over our head, he explained all the different options available for our situation and he made us feel at ease as if you were talking to a close family member.  We find him to be exceptionally knowledgable in many disciplines of Law. Again, call their office FIRST!!!<//review>< pictures>

This is a very professional and friendly law firm. I walked in and was helped right away. Any questions i had regarding bankruptcy they answered  clearly, if i didnt understand they would take their time to explain. First time I went i had spoken with Stephen and breifly explaind my situation since they were near closing time but he still took his time to listen THANK YOU Stephen! Then Angelica helped me with all the paperwork and well the whole process the second time i went. As mentioned before very professional and friendly I felt that they cared and wanted to help me! If your looking to get help with bancruptcy they will do so.They're truly wonderful! THANK YOU AGAIN Stephen and Angelica!! 😊</text>

<Resp>None< /Resp><userid>103104251306054285101</userid><text>This park is a great little pit stop on the way to or coming back from the beach. It is just off the pier at the top of the stairs down to the sand. It wasn't crowded at all, on the weekday, in the AM that me and my guys went. I don't want to give away my secrets, but early is optimal at most places.

The cement slide that runs parallel to the stairs is a great addition.< /text>< rating>

So beautiful here!  You must come by & walk the pier then dip your toes in the ocean.  Plenty of places to eat & they have open bathrooms.  Also playgrounds nearby.  No dogs or skateboarding allowed on the pier.  You do pay $5 for parking.< /text>

This is such a fun beach and town. I visited while passing through on a road trip and am so glad I did! It’s definitely worth the stop.

The pier is a must walk, as it offers some GORGEOUS views! The town offers so much charm- people out and about with their kids and/or dogs just enjoying life. It’s fun to be out and about! There’s a free parking lot within walkable distance to the beach, as well as a pay to park lot. Amble restrooms are available. If your dates are flexible I would advise visiting during the weekday, as the weekend is PACKED!!!!! but regardless of what day you visit, you’re in for a good time.<//review>

Cool that they added the Pismo sign infront of the pier. Definitely a picture spot for selfies or photos to be taken with family. Unique area fer sure considering what it used to look like year ago or so.<//Review>

<Text>What a great place to visit! Definitely go at night. There are less crowds and the people are friendlier as you walk along the beach or on to the pier. The city did a great job with the pier and beachfront walk. Take your children for a stroll. It is an inexpensive memory that they will cherish for a long time!<//Text><Gmap_id>0x80ec58dd2114a2bb:0x9e91d036f9dc6e<//Gmap_id>< response>

I love the pier, even the new design with the kids park love it.  Only thing I see wrong are a good amount of people without masks on, coronavirus era for future reference, and there little trailers they give it a nice touch but some of the things they sell are a little pricey.  But $5 for an hour parking? Ridiculous! Get your money done other way the duck?<//Text>

Beautiful beach,town is getting more up scale with choices of hotels and dining...pier area dressed up recently, but over all not much to do there overall.
We used to stay in our RVing days
At a 5stars, nat'l awarding RVPark just at Southern part of Pismo Beach called Pismo Beach Coast RVPark.  Cleanest and numerous great facilities, pool, mini golf. Walk to pier...etc .  It's right at the beach too!< /Text>

Such a small town feel,  we stayed at Pismo Coast Village it's specifically for RV's and you are allowed a tent at your RV site. Family friendly and Dog friendly town.< /review>

Surprisingly there's lots of shops and outside dining available. The pier has been refurbished and fishing is once again allowed. Masks are required on the pier although only about half of the people were wearing them. It was a nice warm sunny day. If you've never been or haven't been in a while you owe yourself a visit.<//text>< pics>

<rate>4</rate><text>The beach was great! Exactly how a person would imagine a beach to be; amazingly soothing sand(great exfoliation on the feet), and waves crashing to shore. People surfing and a long peer to walk out on, and even a rescue crew in their little hut. There's plenty of room to do whatever you want,  but there's not a convenient place to park; you have to just get lucky and find one somewhere in the neighborhood. It was alot cleaner than I thought it would be too.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<Text>I've been coming here since before I was 6' tall and that's a long time ago.  Anyways, it's the ideal central coast locale to relax and hit up beachy shoppy shops.  Pismo is my favourite of the Five Cities and that's all you needed to know.</Text></record>

Popped open a couple of beers, and soaked up some sun. You could walk a pretty far distance on the sandy beach to get to the water. It was so much nicer and warmer than northern Cali beaches are for chilling.< /Text>< user_id>

I always have a good time in Pismo! There is so much to do here. You can take your 4-wheelers out to the dunes, relax on the beach, grab a bite at the many amazing restaurants, or fish off the pier. It's hard to be bored in Pismo Beach!< /review>

We stop at this beach whenever we're driving to LA. Its a beautiful beach with good scenic views. Not very crowded. Can get quite chilly.  Couple of good eateries around the pier. You might also see some tiny sea creatures on the beach when the tide is low. We spotted some sand dollars.< /Review>

Awful  , terrible,  after  the beach returned to a $ 80 parking ticket out of nowhere, no signs posted  , what a dirty trick, what a scam  , cars everywhere with tickets on them,  ruined our day,  I will NEVER  come back to Pismo,  Moro Bay and other places  are  so much nicer< /text>

< Review>
Pismo Beach is a wonderful Mediterranean weathered place to visit! There are many hidden beaches that one may enjoy with few if any other people around. There are a variety of wineries to also visit along with some waterfalls that you can swim at and Lake Lopez where you can camp and wakeboard. Kayaking is also very beautiful with some caves that you can go through at Shell Beach. Don't miss the many miles of sand dunes that you can wander through south of Oceano. It is a wonderful place to see a beautiful sunset dropping into the blue jeweled Waters. Having lived here for 30 years I have been fortunate enough to experience all of the area's Many Wonders and would be happy to help others to find some of these secret places! Have you ever heard of the Dunites? They were an incredible people living in the Dunes that had a tremendous effect on the twentieth century yet no one knows about them anymore. Find out more on Instagram: @the_dunites_Utopia.</Review>

As of January 2nd the pier is looking fine, almost finished. It's still blocked off for rebuilding and just about finished. Posting pictures later. Parking will be an issue.

Back home and here are a couple of pictures from today of the pier and Pismo.</review>

This is a great place for shopping, eating, and sitting on the beach. Something that I prefer not to do is go swimming in the beach here because it’s too cold. There is a nearby beach that is warmer called Avila Beach which is only 10 minutes of a drive.< /text>

<Review>What can I say beautiful place to live I get to run on the beach every day through the dunes to the estuary and then run in the water.
Very dog friendly lots of birds lots of really cool shells in Sand dollars.. Easy to sit the whole day reading a book or chilling with the family.. And if you go right down the street you can actually ride quads and dune buggies< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOjDoIIyphRZbEtlMImQntUbCy37IzEypSQyj4n=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP20UJxK6FjuT-zy6xuuO8BUVeqLwvQxKxvcHfk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

Nice, family friendly beach. Water was ok in December... Warm enough for some people to swim in (if you have a high tolerance for cold water). This beach is also a popular place for surfing, and there is a shop that sells surfer gear close by. The beach is clean, beautiful and long. There are several hotels close by and so many restaurants within walking distance. Parking can be a bit of a hassle the closer you get to the beach front, especially at popular times in the year.< /Text>

<user_name>Joseph Marrs< /user_name><date>1593042500705</date><rating>4< /rating><Review>I love Pismo Beach, and I've been coming here since before I could walk. Now with stores, restraunts, and parking being open the feel is like an escape to pre-COVID times. They're currently renovating the whole area surrounding the pier (new bathrooms, a park, slides down to the beach, tables, cornhole, etc.) And their new additions look amazing. They finally reopened parking near Wooly's at the end of Pomeroy which really helps with the flow of traffic. The beach is always clean, and it's a great place to hang out with friends, family, pets, or just go for a peaceful walk on your own. The one drawback is the sheer amount of people who smoke marijuana while walking down the street or on the beach; you literally can not escape the smell if you're anywhere near large groups of people. Otherwise it's great, and I'll definitely be back soon.<//Review>< pictures>

All my friends and colleagues planned to spend a day at Pismo Beach and it was worth it. We really enjoyed the time here. Beach is very clean and is not so crowded if you are not next to pier. Water is soo clean here and there are a couple of swings for kids to enjoy and we luckily did not have to keep watch of kids they enjoyed swinging and the beach itself. The only thing which was bad was the restrooms but for a holiday season I guess it is how all the places are.< /Text>

Alder said once it is completed, the hotel will feature a restaurant, pool and event lawn with fire pits and other amenities.

"It's very much a Central Coast beach cottage style," he said. "We didn't look to import Los Angeles to Pismo Beach. Obviously, we like Pismo Beach a lot. It should be a really nice getaway from the hustle and bustle of the major cities -- or the heat of the Central Valley, if that's what you're concerned about."

The hotel is expected to open in April or May 2019, Alder said.

"It's taken us a while to get going, but we're really excited," he said. "It's going to be very high-quality."<//Text>

Loved the beautiful houses before the beach and the nice people. We were shooting some pictures of a newlywed couple and we had many cars and all the residents of one of the streets let us use their front yards to park our cars.
First time in this beach and I love it. Water was clean.</review>

I live down in Los Angeles but would never miss a trip up here with my family every summer. Gorgeous blue water and soft golden sand, with fun rocks to climb on and public activities on one side of the beach, to a quiet and mellow walk on the other. The waves are amazing and I love boogie-boarding in the ocean, no way would I stay down in LA to go surfing. The locals are so friendly, and to top it all off it has that old beach town vibe with buildings that haven't been renovated and modernized like the beaches near me.< /Text>

Beautiful beach, pretty spacious. Scenic and obviously crowded during the summer and extended holidays. The water never warms up though -- not that it should, because global warming -- but just a heads up.</review>

This is a beautiful place to spend a mini vacation. There is an excellent seafood restaurant, the Cracked Crab, in the downtown area. You can order lunch or dinner and take it down to the beach.<//text>

I was there last Friday and it was perfect timing.  I found immediate parking, didn't have an hours wait to eat at Brad's Restaurant and the best part was that the beach wasn't over crowded as it usually is.  This is why I gave Pismo 5 stars for that day.  It reminded me of what it once was.<//review>

<review>There was a crowd at the end of the pier so we headed down and saw numerous whales feeding, not so far offshore so perfect viewing.  Dune   Buggy's south of the pier, take your car all the way down to watch. Fun, fun.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Early morning dolphins and whales were very active.  The whales were jumping out of the water making huge splashes,  and some of the dolphins were actually riding the waves. It was the most spectacular site to see.  The beaches are clean and run for miles ready for families to enjoy.  The beaches are also frequently patrolled by police and life guards which really makes it feel safe.</review>

It's a beautiful and really long beach. You can take your dogs there and just enjoy the clear sky, soft & warm sand and the beautiful coast. On this beach it is allowed to drive your car which makes for an amazing experience. Words can't capture the beauty, so make sure to go there in person</review>

<Review>I learned to skim board and surf here. This town is the heart of California beach culture. Fun shops. Happy people. Good eats and cheap drinks. Some of the best days of my life were spent in this town.

If you've never visited, make a point to do so. You won't regret it.</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<review>Great place that holds great memories from childhood. Looks like they have taken on some new structures and facilities as well as pier repair and improvent. Should prove to be even more accommodating one these new buildings are up and running.< /review>< Name>

I first it was like "wow the beach", however after a few trips I see that its just an overly expensive place with nothing else to do. You can go to any crappy restaurant in the Valley, yetyou will eat better.</Review>

< Review>
Very nice, hip scene, with easy access to beach and hotel recommend to book in advance especially on holidays this place can fill quickly but even then nothing to long of a wait or to far to walk too.. beach is clean considering the amount of ppl there on any giving day.. pier is under construction but not too much was on the old pier the plans of the new one look great can't wait til it's up and running</Review>

<Text>The surf and turf was amazing and I rarely order lobster because I am always disappointed. The Hokkaido scallops were to die for and the apple crostata dessert topped with house made Vanilla bean and thyme ice cream was a nice surprise. The creme brulee was so silky.

Make sure you stop by this beach town on your way up or down the coast. Great views and food.</Text>

<rating>3</rating><Review>Like this beach, but don't love it. It lacks the sanitation of other California beaches and it feels less secure. I was recently there with my family all day and did not once see a lifeguard, police officers, or any emergency responders. The water tends to be very cold and there is often seaweed and other debris all over the sand.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x80ec58dd2114a2bb:0x9e91d036f9dc6e<//gmapID></record>

How are there 818 reviews when the hotel isn’t even open yet? Staying next door and watching the construction as I type this.</text>

Pismo and Avila are probably my two favorite beaches in this area. The parking is kind of a mess in both areas when it is busy.<//text>

How does a hotel that hasn't even been built yet come up with 750 5-⭐ reviews?
Hate deceptive advertising!
They haven't even finished pouring the slab for the underground parking garage yet...you should at least wait until you're open to post fake reviews.<//text>

WTH???~~~~Love Pismo Beach. They need more restrooms/porta potties and garbage cans on the south end of the actual beach  though to make it easier for folks to do the right thing. Parking is very limited and will only get worse when the two new large hotels are completed. Traffic can be a nightmare in the summer and holiday weekends.  Locals give it up to the tourists during those times.< /Text>< Time>

Room's ok. Unfortunately the floor in this Motel 6 and( in Santa Rosa ) floors are really dirty. And there's no refrigerator in the room, so request one when you book your room.</Review>

Nooooooo sleeping in cars in the parking lot.  Great place to busk or share art.. Was a great place to set anchor ie (parking break) for a few days and enjoy times and memories that you will never forget.  Sometimes if ya hit at just the right time or season there was a guy who gives free surfing lessions and surfboard loaning . If u see him u will know its him. Dont be scared he wont bite ... Well possibly so bring peace offerimg or just say hello ..</text>< Resp>

<review>Bad place to visit. Small conservative Beach town filled with ghetto classes people. No fun activities to do here except spend money to stay at a hotel for a subpar beach. Very bad please don't go here. Go to santa Cruz or los osos or Long Beach or stay home.<//review>< rate>

Dirty, worms in the sand.  But you can take your dogs there!  There were some weird plankton or something in the water that kept biting me which was so annoying, so I could not go in the water. Probably won't be returning unless I take my dog, since not many beaches allow pets.< /text>

<Response>None<//Response><username>Star B.<//username><review>I have been visiting Pismo since I can remember. This last visit was OK. The pier being under construction makes the street more crowded and with rude visitors that come, bringing all the trash they can carry. It was once the best beach to visit in California,  but us tourists come, trash it, then leave! That seems to make the people who live and work here much more irritated by our presents. The best thing is the fact they opened all the streets to access the beach. Making it more "spread out" between the beach access. Thank you, to the folks that put up with us. I appreciate you<//review><gmap_id>0x80ec58dd2114a2bb:0x9e91d036f9dc6e</gmap_id><userid>100995471093083002120< /userid><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Date>

(Translated by Google) Photos disputed for the postcard! Tip: go early as there is almost no one! And as the grandmothers say "Don't forget to take the" cardigan ", because it sells a lot, even in the sun!

< Review>
(Translated by Google) It is a long beach with public toilets (very clean and well-taken care of like all of the area), with dunes and informative posters on the animals of the ecosystem.
It is very nice and comfortable, so much for access as for spending time.
The water is quite cold and with many waves.
It's nice to hang out though I would not recommend it for swimming.

(Original)
És una platja llarga amb lavabos públics (molt nets i ben cuidats com tots els de la zona), amb dunes i cartells informatius sobre els animals de l’ecosistema.
És molt agradable i còmoda tan en accès com per passar-hi l’estona.
L’aigua és bastant freda i amb moltes ones.
És agradable per passar l’estona tot i que no la recomanaria per anar a nadar.< /Review>
