Amazing barber! Been going here for years. Both Tammy and Jason know what they’re doing, asks you for your opinion and actually care what’s going on in life too!< /Text>

<review>Very unprofessional service. I walked in to make an appointment and the lady (I think here name is Tammy) she said she was fully booked. That was completely fine, but when I asked for the salon phone number so I can call after I check my schedule her attitude became very rude. She was cutting another customers hair and just started yelling that I shouldn’t be asking for the phone number. Very unprofessional! The customer in the chair and I shared an awkward look before I walked out.</review>< GmapID>

My go-to hair salon when I used to live in SF (I no longer do). Very affordable pricing and the lady is very skilled, she would also suggest minor tweaks to what I want and disucss with me on what's best for my hair instead of fixing a cookie cutter Pinterest hairstyle that I requested without knowing better</review>

Small salon with 2 stylists. Very good service. Highly recommend that you call ahead. My stylist is a guy, and he spent a decent amount of time layering my long hair. Did a superbly thorough job washing/conditioning, and then trimming my hair to style. Very detail oriented. Would definitely come back when I visit San Fran again.< /text>

Her continued work with Rusk allows her to keep up to date on the latest techniques.

If you aren't completely satisfied with your current hairdresser, I would highly recommend that you pay Lisa a visit.< /Text>< Pictures>

I went to this place to get a simple trim after reading about its “great” reviews and “fair” price. I told the guy I just wanted one or two inches cut but he sorta gave me the impression that it wouldn’t be much of a change. So I agreed to trim 3 inches. Now I looked at myself in the mirror and felt like it’s definitely more than 3 inches. I guess that’s just so instead of the 9 dollars price tag, they charged me 15. I’m very disappointed at this experience and will not go back again ever.<//Text>

< Review>
Came here after reading the good reviews. But the woman working here was VERY rough. Pulled my hair a bit, which is fine I was like whatever. But she poked me in the eye with her comb?!!!?? Also combed the back of my neck. Was overall a super rough experience, getting your haircut should be a relaxing experience but this was far from it. Also she said women haircut is twice the price of men’s cheap haircut, which is fine if it took longer than a normal male haircut but it was legit a trim of a couple inches and same amount of time as a men’s haircut (30 mins ish). Overall would not recommend. I’m going to go to somewhere nicer that offers a better experience and customer service next time.< /Review>

I like the place a lot. The haircut is great and the woman who cut my hair paid a lot of attention to details.  Yet she finished within 15 minutes, which is very efficient.  The man's haircut costs $8 and I put $2 for tips.  $10 in total and still very good value.</Review>

Lisa is the best. She is always there to squeeze me in and does a great job. I have come to the conclusion after being to a few places that an $18 haircut here is as good as a $28 haircut elsewhere. Enough said.</Text>

Very efficient little hair salon. Call for an appointment and the owner will usually provide a slot within the day unless it's a Saturday. Also, if you have no preference, she has a male hair stylist as well.

Haircuts are quick, you're not kept waiting beyond 5 mins of your appointment slot and your haircut is not expensive. She does a good job with trims which is only what I've gone here for.

Cash only.< /review>

Spent about ten days here in May of 1996 while waiting to be discharged from active duty.  The base was cool, the NEX, the galley. What made it more pleasant was I had two buddies stationed here. We served together in the Gulf War and Operation Southern Watch.<//Text>

The police officers at the gate need more training, telling someone a dash cam is against California law and being rude and aggressive when asked a question regarding such law. If the clown intended to cite a u.s code then he needs to learn what the code is and not cite California law. California allows for a dash cam to be mounted on the windshield as long as it meets placement criteria and does not interfere with the vision of the driver. EDUCATION is key. Stop hiring idiots with attitude and low IQs. Thank you.</Text>

It's a Navy base next to a deteriorating neighborhood that is next to a chemical plant and a ship yard.
Its pretty decent inside with an NEX and a few upgrades around the base.
Stick to the dry side ehic is a bit much better<//Text>

The travel agent at the Armed Forces Career Center told me that the cruises that were offered here would take me to some exotic locations. I mean, they weren't wrong....but the agent never mentioned all the cleaning and maintenance I would have to do on the way there.

Sleeping accommodations were expected to be the "economy" beds, which is all I could really afford at the time. Was shocked to find out I wouldn't be staying in staterooms that Carnival or Disney cruises boasts. On the plus-side; hearing the sound of the water on the other side of the 2" steel bulkhead was nice when trying to sleep.

They also assigned me to help out with a radar system during my cruise getaway, of which I think radiated me to the point of never producing another "Y" chromosome again in my life.

My cruise wouldn't be complete without mentioning the food. The agent mentioned having chefs onboard and cooked-to-order breakfasts. What I experienced was 52 ways that rice could be prepared, who knew!?!

Giving a 4-star review because after all that trouble I decided I should get an education (which they gave me as a consolation/parting gift) instead of going on another cruise.</review>

It's a Navy base, with a Starbucks, medium size NEX,  macdonalds, and one or two other food places. The base theater is also here, where they play free movies and you only have to pay for snacks. It is a really big base so it does get busy when work starts and wok ends. I'm on shore duty right now, so to workout, I have to go to the smaller base that's connected to it for the gym. It's seriously a 15 min walk on a bridge or a five minute drive. On the little base its connected to is where the barracks rooms are, along with gyms, a bowling alley, small NEX... If you're wondering if they have a big NEX, they do. It's like down the street from the main base. So it's kind of like three bases separated by like a busy street and train tracks, but they are all in walking distance or a less than five minute drive, depending on traffic.<//review>

I was in the Navy for 14 years and went around the world 3 times. I have been in more countries than most people have been states.  All because of the Navy. It was very hard work and my family sacrificed also but I would do it all again.<//text>

FIRST REVIEW EVER.  I wish there was an option for 10 stars.  Here is what happened – our house was in escrow and the buyer’s inspector claimed that there was water in "all of the walls" in the house, which is ridiculous.  Nonetheless, the buyers were ready to walk in light of the inspector’s report.  I began to panic and the next day I somehow came across Abbotts.  I called at 7:00 a.m. and the owner, Jack Martin, answered the call.  Jack was at the house that afternoon and was able to explain exactly where the buyer’s inspector went wrong – and believe me, he was wrong.  While this is too complicated for me to explain, trust that my walls were not full of water, and that there was an inspector's equipment issue.

Jack was kind enough to meet with the buyers and agents at the house and he explained why the inspector believed there was water in the walls, and why the inspector was wrong, (Jack proved this with superior equipment).  The buyers and agents trusted Jack fully, and the deal was back on.  Jack did find some minor issues that needed repair.  He provided a very reasonable estimate for those repairs, the repairs were finished within a few days, and the house closed.  I honestly do not believe my house would have sold to these buyers if not for Jack and Abbotts.  While I have never given a review before, the service and professionalism compelled me to do so in this instance.  I cannot say enough about these guys.  Thank you Jack and Abbotts!</review>

Jack, Preston and the team at Abbott's were angels on earth when my 2800 sq ft home was completely flooded. I called Abbott's on a Sunday within 90 minutes Jack and crew arrived ready to go to work! Jack scoped out the damage, provided a step by step plan for emergency mitigation through construction and everything in between.  Jack handled every detail, coordinated with the insurance company,  was fully transparent in communication and budgeting and literally took the burden off my shoulders and onto his. Jack and his team followed through on every commitment and finished the job within the expected time frame. Jack and team at Abbott's truly care about their customers and are all angels!!</Text>

<Review>I had what I thought was a big mold problem inside and outside of my house.  I searched the BBB.org website and saw that this company had an A+ rating with a 5 star review, so decided to call.  Jack Martin answered the phone and we started to talk about my issue.  He told me to send him some pics of the mold and I did.  He responded that it was not a problem and that he could come over to take a look and then decide what course of action to take.  Jack came over took take a look and told me that I could take care it myself with problem.  Then gave me some good pointers on my gutters.  I mentioned that my wife could smell mold around the house.  He then said, he could take a look with his equipment to see if anything was alarming.  We walked around the house, the bathrooms and garage.  He found the issue of the smell, which was coming from one bathroom.  Jack told me that a plumber or handy man would do the job and everything should be fine.  Jack, for me, went above and beyond and if there’s any issue in the future, I will for sure give him a call. I urge you to call him if you have issues around your house.  He is very personable and professional.  Thank you Jack for your awesome service!!!<//Review>< GmapID>

Their professional work ethic and culture filters right down to every employee at their company. Its no secret to me that at abbots fire and flood the customer is number 1, every time. I would personally recommend them to anyone with a fire and m/or flood restoration issue, and would absolutely call on them personally for any need I may have. They are such a high quality outfit, second to none in San Diego.< /Text>< username>

<review>After an HVAC catastrophe (water was leaking on three levels of our home) Jack and his crew quickly and efficiently came in and managed the clean up and restoration.  Jack was nothing short of professional and  a pleasure to work with.  It is so refreshing having a contractor you can trust and count on to do the job right and in a timely manner.</review>< Pics>

The team at Abbott fire and flood are super responsible, and we're a pleasure to work with. Jack was on time and professional with every one of our meetings. He helped walking through the whole process, and even help work with the HOA. I would use Abbott's fire and flood if we ever have an issue again.<//review>

I had an issue with my toilet leaking. A diyer myself decided to start remodeling my bathroom. When I was starting demolition I noticed that my subflooring was rotting around the toilet and the tub. I haven't done this type of project removing and replacing rotted subfloor (I dont know how to proceed) my plumber friend recommended Mr. Jack's company. I got a call from him. I sent pictures of how it was, he was very understanding and knowledgeable about what I'm dealing with unfortunately their company deals with emergency situations like flooding and fires etc. He referred me to another company. But the kindness and compassion that he gave me says a lot about him and the company that he's with. There should be more businesses like this not all about the profit gains and more about compassion and kindness again Mr. Jack thank you.<//text>

abbott’s fire and flood will always be my 1st call.
I would highly recommend abbott’s for any large emergency. they were here within 60 minutes with large flood trucks with all the people and equipment to help me deal with an overnight flood of our office building.
I was very impressed with how professional and quick everyone was to respond.

From start to finish abbott’s is tenacious when it comes to emergencies. thank you for all the help!<//review>

I love the service and personal touch Jack and his company help us with.  We had some crazy leak and could not figure out where it was coming from.  And we needed someone to clean up, tear out the mess from the leak.  Not only did they do a Phenomenal job, they also helped me figure out where the leak was coming from. They went way above and beyond.<//Text>

We called Jack and told him about the problem we had with the sewer as we really needed a cleanup company promptly as it was a big problem & we wanted it to be fixed ASAP, he showed up the next day & we agreed on everything & the price was reasonable regarding the big problem we had & the high quality service they provided. He came back on the date we agreed on with his son Preston, and they fixed the whole issue in a couple hours, good as new & very professional, I highly recommend their work & I appreciate them coming & working during this hard time when it was really hard to find someone to accept to come & fix the problem.

<Review>Jack and Preston with Abbott’s fire and flood saved the day for me when I had a flood st my house. It wasn’t covered by insurance but I was able to get their expert advice and support at a time that I had no idea what to do. They had fans and a dehumidifier our to our house the same day I initially called, and we had frequent contact with FaceTime to assess the situation and our progress with drying everything up. We are still in the process of fixing things, and I am so happy to know that I can call Jack with any questions and get his expert advice at any time. Abbott’s really treats you like family. I would highly recommend Abbott’s Fore and Flood if you ever find yourself in the unfortunate circumstances of needing their services.</Review>< resp>

<Review>Our late-night fire was caused by a defective Samsung flat-screen TV and resulted in smoke damage throughout the house and major damage to one of our bedrooms.  Smoke, soot, and heavy ash particles were everywhere, including the attic and furnace.

After researching and interviewing several restoration companies, we selected Abbotts Fire and Flood.  The owner, Jack Martin, met with us immediately and guided us through the insurance claim process and educated us on all the health-related matters that needed to be worked through.

We are grateful for Abbott’s prompt response, expertise, professionalism, and ease of communication which made our nightmare situation feel seamless and less stressful.  Their team was a pleasure to work with and you won’t be disappointed if you have a situation where you need a restoration contractor.

Jack, Preston, Karlo I just want to say thank you for everything you guys did and what a beautiful home we now have!< /Review>< rate>

Absolutely the best!!  Very  professional and definitely customer service oriented.  Our lives had just been turned upside down by a neighbor’s water leak and we were scrambling trying to figure out what to do.  Jack with Abbott’s responded immediately.  His calm demeanor and excellent customer service skills put us at ease as he explained everything he would be doing and how he was going to do it! He had all the right equipment to get the job done quickly and efficiently.  We are so SO thankful to have had Jack and his crew handle the mess!  He had great recommendations for getting the other clean up and repair aspects done and guided us in putting our home back in order.  Thank you Jack, for being there when we needed you!<//review>

We had flooding cause by the water company in our area, mu husband was uneasy with their repair contractor and we contacted Abbotts,  Jack Martin came to our house and explained the process to get the crawl space dry, he told us what to expect from the water company contractors, also told us what to demand from them, they  are very helpful and even thou we didn’t hire them to do the clean up, he was always available to give us information and guidance, he called on several occasions to check on how we were doing with the other company and kept us informed on what to ask from them.  Even thou we didn’t contract them I wouldn’t think twice to hire them in the future if we need to work on our home.
I appreciate all the help and concern we had with Jack Martin from Abbotts</review>

Extremely professional.  This is the second time I needed Abbotts fire and flood.  Both times the service was on-time and thorough.  The first event was managed by Jack the father.  Since then Jack has taught his son the business.  Do not let his son's youthful looks deceive you.  His son is fantastic to deal with and his and the team's work should make his father proud</Text>

<text>Our S.D. home failed it’s home inspection days before our closing, the home inspection on behalf on the buyers found a broken main drain beneath the shower on the opposite side of the house from the crawl space opening.  The bathroom drains had been draining directly into our crawl space, flooding half of it for some time. This I thought was going to postponed our move to Scottsdale with the moving truck packed and ready to out front of the house. I called Abbott’s on a Sunday, they were out at my house in less than an hour. We as a family, took to Jack and his son Preston right away. We were quickly disarmed of our anxiety and fears. When someone really knows what they are talking about, You can tell. They called State Farm after hours claims service with my husband, explained what had happened and got a claim number and the OK to start the job. I thought Jack and Preston were going to come back the next day. No, they went out the front and came back in the door with hoses and drying equipment and went to work, Amazing. All worries aside and needless to say, we handed them the keys and left our home one last time before starting the drive to our new home in Scottsdale. I just knew we were in good hands. I want to thank you both, so much for what you guys did for us.</text>< Pics>

I'm a realtor. That day morning, I had a big amount of estimate of other mold company by buyer side real estate agent. I shocked so I called him and asked to get a quote for the same job. He came right away to the property and gave us the quote that half of the amount what I had before. He fixed the problem the very next day and my problem was gone. He tried to do everything he can for helping me and well communicated with everyone including my other side agent and the buyer. Thank you so much, Jack.<//Review>

<review>We had a fire in our house and worked closely with Jack Martin for our restoration needs. He and his team got the job done quickly and thoroughly! Furthermore, Jack was a terrific communicator with us throughout this whole process, and that was really most helpful for us in understanding and appreciating the progress (or challenges) of each step along the way. We could tell that Jack has much experience and skill from which to draw upon, and that was leveraged for us getting back in our home.
Thanks for your help Jack!< /review><resp>None< /resp><UserId.>114880811347616493766<//UserId.><user_name>Hugh Scanlon<//user_name>< rating>

Called Jack during a water emergency and he was here within the hour.   His knowledge and experience in dealing with the insurance companies/ adjusters helped protect me from being taking advantage of. He really watches out for his clients. Highly recommended.<//text>

THANK YOU so much. I am so happy with the level of "utmost professionalism" your company provides. It has far exceeded my expectations. It was also very comforting that you relayed the facts, not assumptions, in a scientific manner regarding my mold problem.< /text>

Dear Abbotts,
Here is the review I promised, and it's long overdue. We had the pleasure of working with Abbotts in April. I called them because, I needed a mold expert to remove the mold, the testing company had found and Abbott's had great reviews on yelp.  I'm so happy I did.  I'm giving you guys high Marks and Five Stars as well. I couldn't be happier with the mold removal / remediation they completed at my home . They were so friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful. They kept my house spotless and more importantly they started the job within 2 days of giving us  the bid. Lastly, and most importantly the final air sampling the follow week came back clean. I was happy to write the check. Thank you, you guys are great, I highly recommend.< /review>

There is a level of satisfaction amongst all of us here, everyone is family. I have seen first hand, what it is to be on an elite team of caring professional people. I have been apart of a lot of hard work and high standards that define being part of the Abbotts Fire and Flood Family.  This Team... My Team, has made a difference in hundreds of happy customers and that makes me proud to be part of this.<//review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Jack, is an honest, straight shooter, knowledgeable, He knows his industry, he’s beyond passionate and he doesn't mind sharing what he knows, based on his experience and industry standards. We had three quotes, we chose Abbott’s, they quoted us a fair price on a  large fire at our home, they itemized everything in the estimate. They walked us through our site with our claims person and explained each cost, This gave us a complete understanding of each line item. Before they started and after we chose them, our insurance company said they sometimes recommend them, which was reassuring. The job is done and we are back in our home. Thanks, Team Abbotts< /Review><Date>1492723222491< /Date><Response>None< /Response>< Name>

Yes, his team is made up of some of the best people in the business. However, that's not the reason to choose Abbott's. Choose Abbot's because they're the kind of folks that will show up, do professional work for a reasonable price and be 100% transparent through the entire process. In one word, integrity. No games, no bait and switch, just honest work. Abbott's is the kind of business your grandfather would choose.<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Jack Martin is man of great character and if, god forbid, we were to experience a disaster, Jack at Abbotts Fire and Flood would be my first and only call, not only because of their extreme professionalism and expertise but because I know I can trust them, and that's a hard thing to find.<//Review>< user_name>

Jack and his team saved me and my client when we found out their property had mold. I needed someone to come out and take care of it immediately. Jack was able to get his crew out there and solve the problem within a few days.  He was efficient and we were able to get through escrow without any delays.  Thank you so much for your quick response and great service.  I will definitely use Abbotts again in the future!<//Text>

I am a real estate agent.  I’ve seen A LOT of houses.  I recently had a home in escrow that presented obvious signs moisture in the walls.  The source of the damage had stumped the general inspector as well as two other Restoration companies.  When I called Abbots I was feeling a little defeated.  Jack answered and he was awesome!  He was able to get out to the home quickly.  Not only was was INCREDIBLY knowledgeable, he brought in equipment that no other company had.  Jack was able to solve our mystery!  From here on out, Abbots will be my first phone call for any home I come across in need of Restoration/Remediation services!</Text>

<Review>I actively and highly recommend Abbotts Fire and Flood for your emergency needs.  I have used Abbotts for multiple issues (mold, flooding, odor issues)  as I am in property management.  Not only do I trust them to understand the problem fully from diagnosis to remediation but it is a pleasure working with Jack and his crew always.  They have all of the right knowledge and information to help me understand the scope of the issue and the best resolution and I just know I am always in the right hands.

I want to thank you for sending Preston and Daniel to our home.
Moving all my furniture around because of the flood wasn't easy, they spent a lot of extra time, taking care of my concerns, while vacuuming up all the water in my house. These guys are professional and do a great job for your company. Their attention to detail, expertise, and professionalism shows, everything went unbelievably great. I was amazed in the end, how good of a job they did. My place is back to normal again, just how I like it.  I have already told my agent about your company. Hopefully they will use your company.

Thank you.<//review>

They sucked out all the water out of the building then started drying everything out.  They work hard and fast.  I would use them again in the future.  Hopefully it doesn't happen again.< /Text>

<review>Best decision we ever made. Would recommend Abbotts Fire & Flood Restoration Company in San Diego, CA  to everyone over and over again!!!  Thank you for all your hard work and professionalism. We have 3 small children and when our basement backed up we were freaked out. Made and call and they came out in 1 hours and worked day and night. They took this very serious and made us feel safe knowing they knew exactly what they were doing THE RIGHT WAY !  Job well done. Better than expected.

<text>Last week we called Abbotts to cleanup a large amount of laundry detergent that spilled all over our mud room floor and carpet.  The concentrated detergent bounced off the top of our washing machine due to an oversize load from my 9 year old. Talk about a mess, it was terrible!  The more water we added, the worse the slippery "sudsy" problem became.  It was a cleanup nightmare!!!!

Abbotts came out immediately and applied a dry powdery material that soaked up all of the concentrated liquid laundry detergent.  Then Abbotts used a huge suction machine to make it all go away.  I was very impressed because they made a nightmare look easy to clean up.

I would highly recommend them to anyone. If you have a disaster call Abbotts. they were very professional, fast, and thorough.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x80deabc14c128bfb:0xe0c262a707246e07</gmapID></record>

<Review>I have been the property manager for a large data center over the past six years. In that time with frequency, I might add. I have had emergencies, smoke, water etc. We have suffered from one very large water main break over 20,000 sq.ft. caused by a utility company and two other large losses. This is a very busy place and security is a big deal around here. I have had the pleasure of working with Jack, Mathew and the team at Abbott's. Hardworking, accommodating my clients, so they can get back to work. I didn't know a restoration company could call an insurance company up and get approved overtime around the clock to get me back in business. From working with containment in ultra clean rooms, they do it all. We have had great success with this company over the years. They are our single source for restoration.<//Review>< Pics>

I am very satisfied with the work Preston and Jack did at my house after I discovered moisture in my lower bath and laundry room. They came out a gave me a free infrared inspection and tested my drywall with moisture meters. Turns out, that my upstair shower had a broken drain line, which was covered by my insurance company State Farm. The guys protected my home with plastic sheeting and removed the drywall, sprayed for mold and dried the place out with fans and dehumidifiers. Barry who did the drywall, texture and paint also did a fantastic job. Thank you<//review>

<Review>I wanted to thank Abbotts for helping come to my rescue. My house was flooded the other night with water damage. I called other restoration companies in San Diego, but not a one answered the phone at 2am. When I called Abbott's. They were at my house within an hour and worked through the night, moving furniture and pulling carpet to get the water out of my house and start drying. I was impressed by their efforts. They moisture checked my house daily, moved equipment to make sure that my house was dry. Thank you for all your hard work! ( Preston, Pete, Barry and Jack)</Review>< rate>

Recently moved to Point Loma and after a month of living there my dishwasher started leaking. That leak eventually turned into a flood and I needed help immediately. Jack and his team came to my rescue and really saved my entire kitchen and dining room. These guys are the best water damage restoration company in San Diego - very honest and professional!!!!</text>

When in need of restoration services, you need a skilled team you can trust.I know first hand how difficult it can be to find ethical professionals with your needs and interest at heart.  I couldn't recommend a better team of skilled professionals to get the job done!<//Text>

Jack and his team have been great to work with.  I would recommend him for restoration work without hesitation.  They obviously have the equipment and the skills to clean and restore properties, but they add a personal touch in their communication with their clients, consultants, and the other parties.< /Text>

Abbott's wasn't my first call. They were the first to pick up the phone at 10pm on a Sunday though. They just did a fantastic job, these guys were at my home in 45 minutes, when everyone else said they would schedule me for the morning. I can't stress enough how much I appreciated that when my house was soaking wet. They sucked up all the water, pulled the carpet and pad and left me with lots of equipment.  Just nice guys. father and son.
I highly recommend them.< /Text>

I've known Jack and the Martin family my entire life, I grew up with his uncle and grandfather, who mentored him building homes on the Jersey shore in the 80's & 90's. I worked with Jr. as I called him for over ten yrs. in the building industry. I can attest to the high quality of his work, his honesty and passion for his craft. "They just know how to do things well, especially restoration and people like that.
People like having someone treat them fair and honest, that's what you can expect of Jack and his company. The peace of mind of knowing thing will get done right. The first time.

When I choose contractors to work with, it is highly important that I work with the best.  I am the general manager of a premier luxury apartment building in San diego and I have to rely on those who are experts in their field, on time, responsive to my needs and professional for our residents.  Abbotts is just that.  I absolutely recommend them for water damage remediation.<//review>

Someone 2 floors above had been smoking and the fire sprinklers were triggered, causing the floors below to become flooded. The fire department was already on their way, but thankfully Jack Martin of Abbott's Fire and Restoration lived in our building. As soon as Jack saw me he came running up the stairs to our apartment and dismantled the shower head and diminished the destruction. Although there was damage to the carpet, because of Jack's immediate response, the situation wasn't nearly as bad a sit could have been! Thank you Jack Martin!</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

I called Abbotts and Jack came out and inspected my house gave me a bid just for the clean-up.

< Review>
As a manager of South Florida luxury condominium towers, I have experienced a range of storm and flood disasters over the past ten years.  The most recent was the worst,  but mitigation by Abbott’s led by Jack Martin was absolutely the best.  Top notch equipment, technicians, strategy, and follow through. There were continuing weather incidents causing re-wetting. Jack and team monitored constantly and were back on site at all hours of day and night with impeccable response, discipline and documentation so essential to a complex event and insurance claim.  We never called for extra service, they came, did what needed to be done and met us with timely reports.
For all of that, what really puts Jack and his team over the top is their respect, compassion and care for all the people affected. They themselves were working 12 plus hours a day, double bunked for weeks miles from home, but always had smiles, empathy and a helping hand going the extra mile before we could ask.
Bravo and a million thanks to Jack and the Abbott’s family team.  — M. Niemeier, LCAM</Review>

We experienced flooding in our crawl space in January, after the rains. Unfortunately, we enlisted a company our insurance adjuster suggested.
A month or so later, we started to feel the negative health effects of living with mold. We decided to research and hire our own unbiased team to test, sample the crawl and air in our home, only to find out, our home was unfit for human habitation.
Faced with live colonies of visible mold in the crawlspace and spores throughout our living areas. we hired Rarefied Air Environmental, who then referred us to the team at Abbott's. The guys at Abbott's did a great job working with Rarefied, providing containment of each area, until clean sampling came back clean from the lab. The idea of taking one room on at a time. Sampling, cleaning, sampling again until passing air sampling, reassured me that each area was free of mold. The very last day, the guys pulled the containments down in each clean and sampled area, like a giant gift of health for us. I want to sincerely thank, Rarefied Environmental & Abbott's Fire and Flood.< /Text>< name>

I am a provider of insurance work in San Diego for insured clients who have suffered a property loss due to fire, flood, mold and vandalism. I have been doing this for over twenty-five years. I have worked with 1000's of insured clients and have referred my customers to many local preferred contractors and specialist in the disaster restoration industry. I currently use less than a handful, One I have grown to use more and more, due to response time and customer service is Abbotts fire and flood of San Diego. I was lucky enough to have one of my clients call me and tell me how satisfied they were with their services. At the end of the day, that's all it comes down to. Not having customers call regarding contractors that don't communicate and provide less than good service. I am happy to refer Abbott's to all my clients who ask me for a referral.<//Review>

Thank you Yelp, for Abbotts Fire and Flood San Diego.

I had an emergency situation at my cafe in South Park at 5 pm on a Friday evening.  I had a major flood in the crawl space under my cafe from a broken pipe, leaving hundreds of gallons of sitting gray water.  After calling several flood and disaster specialists and getting the runaround, from other companies answering services and no returned call backs.  I luckily found locally owned and operated Abbotts.  After a few rings, a gentleman (the owner) answered and took a brief assessment of the situation. He promised to arrive in 45 mins and to my surprise he did. Abbott’s is operated by a father and son team.

They completed the job of removing the flood water and made sure that the surrounding area was clean and disinfected of any dirty gray water. Not only did they do a great job, but they were very courteous in having the professionalism of dealing with the surrounding tenants, who were concerned about the water residue.  This company went above and beyond to satisfy. To Preston and Jack. Thank you for taking care of me and my business, I don’t know what I would have done had, you both not come to my rescue. I fed them both afterward, and now they are regulars at my cafe.    They are the very best at what they do!!

My three-story townhouse flooded due to a faulty sprinkler head.  I had about a 1000 gallons of water go through 3 floors.  It was a disaster!  I called Abott's fire and flood after the fire department shut off the sprinkler system. They were there in less than an hour starting clean up and drying out my place.   Calling Abbott's made the difference a difficult and stressful situation.  They were professional efficient and knowledgeable.  I will keep their number on speed dial i just hope i don't have to use it!</text>

<pics>None<//pics><Name>Cory Lane<//Name><Text>Had a huge water pipe burst from faulty plumbing while we were away for the weekend.  We came home to 8 inches of standing water in our basement that started in our new master bath and quickly spread through the house.  Our first call was to our insurance agent who suggested we call Abbott's. Within 45 minutes they had a team at our house and after a quick walk through and some paperwork to fill out, they got started.  My wife and I moved to a hotel and abbott's worked through the week to get our house dry and back to new.  A good amount of our belonging had to be inventoried and photographed, because they were ruined, fortunatley Abbotts was able to save and dry out a lot of family photos and other personal things in place.  We were very impressed with the work they did.  The professionalism of the employees and how well they worked with the insurance adjuster. You wouldn't be able to know we had a flood in our house, highly recommended.</Text></record>

This is the first time I have ever written a review.  I live in Colorado and had an ugly sewage and plumbing disaster strike my rental property in California.  Jack of Abbotts F & F SD worked extremely well with not only me, from afar, but with my property manager and insurance adjustor as well!  My tenants were also very pleased with the quick results.  Jack also went out of his way to provide us with a reliable electrican and roofer.  I hope something like this doesn't happen to me again, but if it does, I now know who to call.  I highly recommend!< /Text>

We discovered lots of water coming from what seemed everywhere upon arriving home, a broken supply line to the toilet in our upper bathroom was the culprit. Water coming through the ceilings. Jack and his son came over and took complete control of the whole situation, these guys were quite amazing. Extracting water, moving furniture, cleaning up, installing equipment and drying out the my wet house. What a mess and what a job they had to deal with. I want to personally thank you both for your kindness and professionalism. I would highly recommend.<//review>

I just wanted to take a minute to thank all of you for your hard work. The fire sprinkler loss we suffered, well our offices were completely flooded and everything was just soaked and I was worried that we would be out of business for the foreseen future. Five plus days with your fans and heavy duty drying machines and normalcy is imminent . I want to thank Abbott's, I wanted to let you know I am very pleased and thankful for their assistance in working with the adjuster and the quality of professionalism of the your men who came in and fixed our problems. The flooded offices are just as they were before, ready for some small repairs. I appreciate not having to oversee the process. I will definitely recommend your services.
I am also directing a copy of this letter to Chubb and my agent who has had my coverage for the past 10 years to thank everyone at Chubb for their support in a time of crisis. Again, thanks< /text>

<text>Our home flooded in San Diego while we were on vacation.  When we walked in there was mold everywhere and the house smelled awful.  IOne of the pipes had broken which we did not notice because we were gone.  We called two different companies including Abbotts Fire and Flood and they were able to come clean up early the next day.  They accepted our insurance which was great. They removed all the water and began drying the house with big fans that circulated air to dry everything out.  The fans were there for several days and when they were finished all the mold was gone and we could start installing our flooring. The entire staff was great including the owner Jack who was very helpful during a stressful time.  I would use them again if I ever need their service.< /text>< pics>

I went in this morning for a much needed cleaning after I had my braces removed. 2 years is a long time to go without a good cleaning. And I was not disappointed. After a few xrays and meeting with the dentist, the hygienist came in and did an amazing job. Overall my visit to Dr. Towson’s was great. It was a pretty quick process after signing all the new patient paperwork. The staff was very friendly and it was a pleasure to have a dentist sit down with me and break down my X-rays to ensure I have a healthy dental plan in place. I told him it was like watching a Ted Talk because he gave me such great info. I highly recommend this office (Ackerman/Towson Dentistry) and will continue going there for future cleanings.

I don't normally do reviews about experiences, other then food! I have been going to Dr Ackerman and Dr Towson for more then twenty years. The dental office is well established and functions like a well engineered machine. I don't know dental pricing per-say, but I feel like I am getting more then my monies worth. The Hygienists and Technicians are super welcoming and professional with an excellent chair-side manner. I walked in today to happy chatter and then the singing of happy birthday for a fellow cohort! I would absolutely recommend this practice. The whole staff has an amazing work relationship!< /Review>

I have been going to Dr Ackerman and his team for over ten years and they have always been a huge blessing to me and my family. There isn’t anyone I would trust with the dental care of me and my family like I do the Ackerman and Townsen team if your looking for a family dentist look no further they are the best.<//Review>

Great office, The front desk staff makes you feel right at home immediately when you walk in the door, a great place to go take care of your teeth.

Dr. Ackerman and Dr. Towson and my hygienist Norma and The team are always very professional friendly and welcoming, I been a patient for over 10+ years I wouldn’t change or go anywhere else, I highly recommend them. The best dentist in town, Professional, courteous, and friendly staff will always make you feel like family… I highly recommend them.</text>

<Text>The best experience I've ever had with a dentist. I am so terrified of the dentist that I cry as soon as I sit in the chair even if it's just a cleaning. My nerves always get the best of me. Dr. Locascio was so kind and understanding, he put me at ease with less tears than usual :) I actually left the office with a smile on my face. They put together a treatment plan for me to fix issues I've had for years and offered several options to deal with my fears so that I would be able to handle getting everything done. I feel so lucky to have found them and would recommend them without a doubt.<//Text><userid>103765538478501295993< /userid>< Time>

Dr Ackerman is a very nice dentist who really listens to my concerns and strives to find the best solutions to solve any dental issues that i am experiencing. He came highly recommended by a friend who said he was the best dentist in our area and I would definitely agree. The staff is very friendly and helpful with any questions I have. I am grateful to have found Ackerman and Townsend Dentistry.< /Text>

<review>Haven't seen a dentist in about 6 years.  Kept meaning to find a new dentist when I moved out here 20 years ago, but in my mind it was easier to just drive to Pleasanton, to my dentist I had for over 10 years.  Well, he retired a couple of years ago, so I pulled the trigger, and I'm glad I did. I saw Dr Locascio, and he was GREAT!  And the staff is wonderful too!<//review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>{'time': 1613676922233, 'text': 'Thank you for the great review!

< review>
I am choosing to comment besides giving a 5 🌟 rating simply because this dental practice deserves more than a 5 🌟 rating. My family and I have been going to Dr. Ackerman for many years. I know when trying to find a new dental practice to go for your care it can be sometimes difficult to have to depend on star ratings as something that helps you decide  something that important. That's why I decided instead of just posting five stars I reassure anybody who would be reading this you will be just fine in Dr Ackerman's care. His whole entire staff are genuinely kind people and Dr.Ackerman has very gentle hands. As for all of the dental assistants I can say they are the best dental assistants in any office around, I know this because I too became a dental assistant for a handful of years, (a long time ago) after inquiring about what it would take and where to go from an assistant to Dr. Ackerman. Rest assure if you are in need of a new dental practice for yourself or your loved ones, Ackerman Towson dentistry would be an excellent choice!</review>

The friendly atmosphere of the front desk staff was very welcoming. The care given to me as an individual is unmatched. I also really appreciate the way Dr. Towson explains things so thoroughly and empathetically. The video allowing me to view what is going on in the procedure is also a great touch. This has to be one of the best practices around.<//Review>

I've been a patient of Dr. Towson's dental practice for a few years.  Their Staff is great!  Dr. Towson provides excellent dental care always communicating best plans and options, with great dental hygienist to compliment their dental practice.  The ladies at the Front office are always courteous, and providing great customer service.  I recommend Dr. Towson's office to anyone who is looking for a wonderful dental practice.<//Review>

Norma cleans my teeth and she is phenomenal,  nobody does a better job than her and I would travel back from anywhere in the world to have her clean my teeth.
The staff is awesome - friendly, courteous, kind and they do their jobs well.  This is a top notch dental practice and I would recommend it to anyone!</Review>< Pics>

I suffer from high anxiety and don’t normally do well at the dentist. Hence when I was told I had a fractured tooth that had to be extracted, I had major concerns.  However Dr Towson made me feel at ease right off the bat.  He first acknowledged my fear and walked me through the entire process.  By managing my expectations, it helped me play out what will happen in my head.  True enough it was a painless experience.  He put me in a state of conscious sedation so when I woke up , it was done. There was no chance for a panic attack.  To me that was fantastic!<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

<Text>The doctor was very friendly and made my visit enjoyable. He took the time to go through my xrays with me and helped me understand his recommendations. Quite impressive bc I have never understood how the xrays are interpreted. He explained the treatment course and did a good job with the cleaning. I look forward to going back. And would highly recommend Ackerman to anyone.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x808ff939525b51fd:0x299e23266fd80fcc< /Gmap_id></record>

Everyone there is always so friendly and on-time. Dr. Townsend is very thorough and always reviews all of your treatment options. I never feel pressured. The  hygenesists are just as kind and accommodating. I've been going here for years and highly recommend it.</Text>

Dr. Ackerman is the best most skilled and compassionate dentist I have ever been to in my 68 years. He listens and explains everything in simple terms so he is easy to understand. I felt like I struck gold when I found him and his staff. Everyone in the office is warm, caring and friendly. I do not dread going to the dentist anymore! So If you need dental care, Ackerman and Towson Dentistry is the place to go!<//text>

I have been coming to Ackerman Towson Dentistry for over 2 years.  I have always had a positive experience starting with Sarah at the front desk, to the friendly and caring dental assistants, to Dr. Towson explaining what is going on and letting me know all my options, to working with the office on insurance coverage and payment options.  I highly recommend this practice for receiving high quality dental care and a positive dental experience.</review>

I have been blessed to meet both Dr's. I see Dr. ACKERMAN. Many years ago I had have gas, to even to get a filling. I was so stressed to have to go to the dentist. Dr. A. Has a wonderful calming way, and I no long need gas for any dental work. One day recently while waiting for him to finish with another client, I even fell asleep in his chair i was so relaxed. The man knows his job and does it excellently. He has in the past, even given his services to the low income and homeless through a Golden Hills Ministry. A very caring and passionate person. Highly recommend for his professionalism.</text>

I had a crown break over the weekend. Dr Towson got me in right away and discovered the crown was only 2 years old. He prepped the area and took impressions and is rebuilding it under warranty out of zirconium this time to be sturdier.
I always feel I'm getting the best advice and treatment from Dr Towson.<//review>

<text>Dr. Ackerman was the first dentist I've ever had to spend time with me going over my xrays. He went over keeping my bones strong to the importance of
cleaning my teeth as I flossed to keep both my teeth and gums healthy.
The hygienist Norma was amazing she was professional and sweet. She gave me the best deep cleaning  and reminded me the importance of flossing every day. I highly recommend her when you visit.
The front desk person Melissia was very kind she made me feel very comfortable to be at the dentist.
If you are looking for a dentist in Brentwood I highly recommend this team of individuals.<//text>< Pictures>

< review>
Wife and I recently moved to Brentwood and we were looking for a new Dentist. A neighbor who happens to be a retired Dentist, suggested Ackerman & Towson Dentistry. We felt because our neighbor was a retired Dentist and was very happy with this dental office, we decided to give it try and were glad we did. Wife and I have been seeing Dr. Locascio in the office and have been very pleased with the service he provides. He takes the time to throughly explain what to expect and we appreciate that. Were very happy with Ackerman Towson Dentistry, Dr. Locascio, and lastly the support staff that work there.<//review>

Dr. Ackerman was able to see me right away when my regular dentist was not available. His staff was friendly and professional. They all made me feel as if I was already a patient in the office. He is amazing and I will be changing dentist and bringing my entire family there.<//Text>

< Review>
The care and professionalism of Dr. Ackerman and Dr. Towson and their staff is unparalleled. Going to the dentist can be a pleasant experience and they prove it over and over... Our family has been with Dr. Ackerman for over 15 years and have received incredible care. We also see how they give to our community and serve in other countries and we so appreciate the outward focus of their business and personal lives.<//Review>

Love our hygienist. She's very thorough yet gentle. Dr. Ackerman made my wife's crown on the same day he did the preparation for it.  It was in place within a few hours instead of days.</Text>

Wow, this has got to be the slowest moving baristas on this planet. Only 2 customers were ahead of me and I waited 15 minutes. And the sad thing is there was 3 employees in the kiosk, and the customer behind me got her drink before me. My drink was okay.<//Review>

Went to the Starbucks inside target. The girl, Brianna was very rude. I ordered 2 drinks, a frap and an iced coffee. When I asked why the price was higher for the iced coffee, she snarkly responded that the prices are higher In store and doesn’t make the pricing rules. On top of that, her and the other girl decided to hold a personal conversation before making our drinks... prolonging our wait... it wasn’t until the guy came out and took over, he was absolutely pleasant and would love to give 5 stars for his interaction and great customer service. Unfortunately those 2 girls ruined it and I will gladly take my business to another Starbucks.<//text>

I went in and they were super busy. I thought I would be waiting forever! But that is not what happened. I was taken back by Quinn. She was amazing. She left my nails looking phenomenal. I decided to stay for a pedicure and Jon did an amazing job. I love it here. Get in and get out with great service and great results!!<//Text>

<Review>Good when you're in a hurry. But only last about a week. Prices are a bit high. And they have a lot of males working there which in my opinion most women don't really like.. Don't specialize in nail designs. Pretty old school.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

<review>I’ve been coming here for a couple of years now. I think it’s safe to say that Helen is my official nail lady😊 I get Stiletto nails every single time and she does an amazing job. My nails look perfect every single time!

Also Nancy does really good pedicures! She takes her time and makes sure your feet feel amazing after!< /review>< pictures>

<Text>This place is barely mediocre. This is a "cash only" place. They do have an ATM inside but you get fees. They don't properly shape your nail and spend the whole time talking amongst themselves. They do not apply a base coat, which is the first salon I've ever been to where they don't. It is crucial so it doesn't turn your nails yellow.  If you're looking to do your nails for a special occasion I wouldn't recommend this place. If you desperately need a refill... eh they will look mediocre for 2 weeks. First time I went they were super cheap so I brushed the quality off. This time was more expensive and worse job. Will be finding somewhere new.<//Text>< pictures>

<Text>absolute TRASH i came in for my birthday with my mother and sister to get pedicures and i brought my own color. and when i gave it to the lady she seemed shocked i chose the color i did and she was making weird disgusted faces.
when she did my pedicure she didn't do a good job what's so ever and she didn't take off any dead skin on my feet and when she tried to get my cuticles she ended up cracking my toe nail, which later fell off but she painted over it anyways. she took the nail color and half ASSED it she did so bad you could see the lines from the paint and it was a light color so you needed more than two layers for it to be a solid color which she clearly didn't care about. she started talking in a different language to her coworker as they looked at my feet and started laughing. i never felt so disrespected in a nail salon. after i asked a different lady to repaint my toes because they made me feel insecure about the color i picked and she was much nicer. never going back poor service rude and TERRIBLE workers</Text>< pictures>

Worse customer service ever!!! I went in with my cousin she was going in to get her nails fixed after paying $35 they all fell off after only 4days. When we walked in we waited more than 15 minutes just to be acknowledged and when she finally spoke to Henry he was a total disrespectful jerk to her and said he wasn't going to do anything about it I I seriously wanted to punch him in the throat...<//Text>

TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE, RUSHED & MESSY! Stay Away! I went to this place instead of my usual place because my usual place was super busy. Walked in and was greeted fine, asked for a mani/pedi w a design. Showed them the design, they said they could do it. My first sign to run should've been that the pedi chair's tub looked dusty when I sat down, but I stayed because they put a liner on the tub. The pedicure was ok, no real complaints except that my nail tech was talking to the other ones and I had to repeat myself when she was hurting me. The manicure was terrible! The lady who painted my nails did it so rushed that there was barely any drying in between coats therefore it was becoming like a thick slime with noticeable crevices. I mentioned it and she said it would be fixed w the top coat. Next comes the design, by this time it was close to closing time, the girl started my design on my left ring finger and it came out good. Someone then told her something in their language and she started doing my right hand super rushed. It was smearing and she kept layering polish to try to fix it. She through top coat on It and rushed me out. I told her it was smeared and she said it was "cute". Anyway, i go back today, Im asked what I need and I said I need to get a nail fixed (not wanting to mention the bad work in front of other customers) the man there asks me to show him, I do and he loses his mind! He starts telling me that if I left then they're not responsible, I said ok but it was late, I need it fixed anyway so I'll pay. He then says he has no time. I asked how long the wait is and he starts YELLING at me that I'm pressuring him and that he won't give me a timeframe and he's not having me cut In line and to come back at 2. I never asked to go ahead of anyone, so I tell him I can come back at 5 after work, he says he will see if he can but that if there's other people I will have to wait til all the manicures and pedicures are done for the day! Lol I walked out instead and went down the street where they fixed their terrible work. i have pictures to post if this allows me to.</review>

While the guy was taking off my acrylics, he cut my skin with a nail clipper! I was left with a bloody pinky and nail glue was still left on my nails. Will never go there again!< /Text>

Awesome! My dog can be picky but he loved the cake so much and it didn't hurt his stomach at all!

I walked in and ordered a 5 inch cake, and was happily surprised that they went ahead and wrote a message on a 5 inch cake while I was there and was able to walk out with it right then!</Review>

<Review>I was able to get a last minute birthday cake that both of my dogs enjoyed very much. It's good to know we have an excellent dog bakery in Corona that provides wonderful baked goods and dog treats with natural ingredients.<//Review>< username>

Even though I love going jackboy's I haven't been to this location. Just wanted to put it out there that the location is CLOSED cause of  covid19 since Google shows it as open. They have a sign in the door.  The other location is open though.<//Text>

This is a great place to pamper your dog. They great, healthy treats. Though the store is small, you can tell they make almost all the treats there themselves.</Text>

It was wonderful! My dogs loved the cake. No better way to celebrate a 10th Birthday.  Very helpful.  Just didn't like it location. Tucked back into the buildings. All in all, great place.</Text>

Started off with the café de olla which was top notch. Quality customer service and clean restaurant and tables. Was craving chilaquiles so went for that with the steak. The green salsa was awesome and everything tasted great. The steak was a little overcooked but still had good taste/seasoning.</Review>

It wasn’t bad and it wasn’t that good either. I never mind paying top dollar for good quality food. But when the food doesn’t reach expectations plus high price, it’s a double loss.</Text>

< review>
I've had food from this establishment years ago and I was not very impressed. I decided to try it again since there was a sign stating that it had new management. I'm glad I did :)

The carnitas gordita was bomb. The barbacoa taco was delish. I've only had one memorable barbacoa place and this place definitely gives it competition.

The meat is well seasoned and cooked. Will definitely come back.</review>

< review>
The birria tacos are not worth $3.75 a piece when they are NOT made right.. The corn tortillas were NOT dipped in consume and fried with Cotija. They were single plain corn tortillas and there was SO MUCH cinnamon in the consume that we all didnt use it and were still charged $4 a bowl of consume each ....and they were HUGE bowls too so instead of suggesting we split one between the table he took advantage of the situation and charged us $102 for 12 tacos, 3 sides of rice and beans 3 consume sides and 5 sodas... Yeah $102 between 3 bills for a lunch in the barrio... Umm we look white but home boy we are all Mexican and we were ALL disappointed and sort of sad you ripped us off For 4 of us to eat it was $102 umm ... We paid because its illegal not to. Period..skip this trap house< /review>

This spot is a hole in the wall but has one of the best Birria de Borrego it has a very rich taste the consume is top-notch, and one of the pluses they have is that they serve fresh from scratch Aguas Frescas. When your around stop buy you wont be disappointed!!</Review>

<Review>Where to begin?  First, the  good news, service was great.  That's about it for the good news.   They charge for chips & salsa $1 for dine in - that knocked the first star off for me.  My husband got chicken taco - no bueno.  Skimpy ingredients, chicken was thigh meat, seemingly microwaved, no flavor.  Knock off another star. My daughter's quesadilla was smaller than a soft taco!  And that was her entree. Knock off another star.  My meal came out last. (Enchilada was okay but same chicken as the taco and hardly any meat on the 3 tortillas on the plate.) So none of us ate together.  Knock off another star. Rather disappointing overall.  We will likely not be back</Review><gmap_id>0x80c2b4498b5c477f:0xb7fe903d1e16ab00<//gmap_id>< name>

They have delicious borrego (lamb). I highly recommend it! It is a family owned business and they will give you good service. Give it a try!< /Review>

<Text>My wife and I love this place. We've been coming here for a while now, usually for breakfast. They have some very good Mexican food. The house special is the Birria which is excellent. My wife almost always gets the Chilaquilles Verdes with Clara (egg whites). I always mix it up everything I have eaten there has been great. I would recommend this spot to anyone wanting to try authentic Mexican food.<//Text>< user_name>

I have dined here with family several times. The food is always fresh and is delicious. I had the caldo de rez the last time I went and it was very savory with lots of meat and corn served with a side of rice and onions with a spicy sauce. Also had the shrimps with the spicy mole which were also delicious. The owner Memo is very personable and goes out of his way to make sure you have a good experience.< /review>

<Rate>4</Rate><Review>Almost perfect.
My Quesadilla, made from masa de maiz (corn tortilla masa) and with Flor de Calabaza (squash blossoms) was amazing!  Their Quesadillas made with masa are completely different from the flour tortilla ones you're probably used to.  I suggest you give one a try!  Incidentally, they do have Quesadillas made from flour tortillas, so if you insist on that, you're good!
My mom tells me that her Birria de Chivo was perfect, served with chopped onions and cilantro and tortillas on the side.
My Torta was the only thing I had a small problem with.  I ordered a Torta made with Barbacoa de Res (beef, as opposed to the traditional lamb, which they also have) and was expecting my beef to be juicy with that awesome broth it's supposed to have.  Instead it was dry.  It had the consistency of carnitas, only dryer.  That made me a little disappointed.
Everything else about the Torta was delicious, though.  The bread was perfect, the beans and avacado were delicious, and the queso fresco (or panela, I'm not sure!) was a happy surprise!
I will definitely go again and try their other Quesadillas.  They have Ongos (mushrooms), and even Huitlacoche (can't describe, look it up!).  And I will try the Torta again, only this time with Al Pastor.  Can't go wrong with that!</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

Decent food at a reasonable price. Atmosphere is not the selling point, but the flavors are authentic. Just be careful if you're not a hot and spicy kind of person; it'll creep you on you quick if you don't realize it<//text>

<text>Borderline 2.5 stars. Food was alright. I had 3 tacos dorados and the meat was bland. I think they were all adobada. Someone mentioned goat and I may go back to try it. Yelp had me excited as I was having problems finding legit Mexican food near the office.

I'll give them another shot and update this review.</text><Rate>3<//Rate><user_id>114048082676495239746<//user_id>< GmapID>

My experience here is a bit biased since I know the owner, however....all his friends prompted the family to open a restaurant because his food is so good. He used to serve good quantities at his parties and so he does the smae at the restaurant. Anything you have there is good...my favorite is the birria and my wifes is the quesadillas de flor de calabaza. My kids always pick the caldo de pollo....just like grandma makes it. Its family owned and operated and they are really nice people. you wont be disappointed.</Text>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) We were spending the night right next to this restaurant and based on the reviews here, we decided to go for dinner. Food from the 10th and totally homemade. We ordered a goat burrito and a pozole and delicious! Without a doubt, if we have the chance to return to the US, we will return to this place for delicious food!

(Original)
Hacíamos noche justo al lado de este restaurante y por las reseñas aquí presentes decidimos ir a cenar. Comida del 10 y totalmente casera. Pedimos un burrito de chivo y un pozole y riquísimo! Sin duda, si tenemos ocasión de volver por EEUU volveremos a este lugar para tomar comida rica!<//Review>

If you live in the Antelope Valley, then you know the quality of medical care here is generally fair to poor. However, Dr. Jackson is the exception. Indeed, he is one of the finest physicians under whose care I’ve been. Dr. Jackson is thorough, yet he will work with you to achieve your medical goals. Further, he is an excellent surgeon, having performed a highly successful throat surgery on me fifteen years ago. One never feels rushed by Dr. Jackson, and he is a consummate listener. Consequently, if you’re seeking an ear, nose, and throat doctor, Dr. Jackson has my highest recommendation.<//review>

<Review>My first experience with an ENT doctor was...interesting.  The procedure that had to be done wasn't fun at all but my experience with the staff and Dr. Jackson was great.  From the moment I stepped in the office, the staff was very pleasant and helpful.  Upon meeting Dr. Jackson, I was put at ease by his friendly demeanor.  He gave me his undivided attention.  Even after my exam and very unpleasant procedure, he didn't rush out to tend to his other patients.  He sat with me as I asked questions and made sure to clarify the next steps so that I completely understood.  And even after that he asked me if there was anything else on my mind that I needed to discuss.  It was refreshing to feel like I was a priority to him.  I would recommend Dr. Jackson to anyone.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< rate>

Absolutely loved my visit with Dr. Jackson.  After months of headaches many trips to my doctor then to a neurologist that recommended me to Dr. Jackson I was hoping he was the saving grace that could figure it out because I never get headaches and sure enough he did.  He was patient and kind and spend almost an hour going thru my history and MRI and the different medications that I had been on and I can not thank him enough very grateful to have such an amazing doctor here in the Antelope Valley and the staff was awesome too!<//Text>

I was told by someone in his front staff that I would be seeing an audiologists during my visit which they don’t have in his office. Not only was I lie to and now stuck having to pay a visit bill but his office manager was very rude when I explained to her my issue with the bill. Unfortunately after being lied to, I need to pay the bill so my credit isn’t affected. I wouldn’t recommend this office to anyone, they care more about the money than helping anyone.< /review>

After going to four different doctors, I found Dr. Jackson and he knew exactly what was wrong and looked further into my issue. He is very kind and actually took time explaining everything to me. Him and his whole staff truly care about what they do. I wish more doctors were like him. Highly recommend!</review>

We shook hands & then he proceeded to clean my ears in a very professional way.  He is very kind, took time to explain some important matters regarding my treatment.  Am very satisfied & will return for my next visit gladly!!!  Thank you Staff!!!!!

Have been to Dr. Jackson several times & each time it has been a pleasure being treated.  Everyone is very kind & the doctor is very personable!  Just hope he will be there a while, give him 5 *****!!!!!</review></record>

I looked for a ENT Doctor on Yelp, and came across Dr. Jackson. I went to see him today and was so happy I choose him to see for my concerns.
He’s friendly and very through. I never felt like he was rushing and took the time to explain things.
Also his staff was so friendly. It’s very hard to find a great Doctor and a great staff.
I highly recommend Dr. Jackson.<//text>

<review>During my first visit, I found Dr. Robert M. Jackson to be personable and pleasant, adept at articulating his diagnosis and treatment in a clear and precise language. You get the feeling that you're dealing with a physician who knows what he's doing. He also gave me the impression that he cared about me as a patient. That is important. Hence, if the need arises, I certainly would see him again.

In addition, he is supported by an equally able and pleasant staff.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>{'time': 1405621833439, 'text': "Dear Patient,\n\nThank you for your kind and generous review.

Great!  First doctor's office I didn't want to leave.  Delightful receptionist!  Very warm friendly waiting room environment.  Free pen, big deal - yes, it is a good looking pen that actually works, great!  It was my wife's appointment so in reference to Dr. Jackson I can only repeat what she said "He is cool.  I really liked him."  Bottom line, if you looking for doctor check out Dr. Jackson.  "He is cool" and his receptionist and waiting room environment are very cool.< /Text>

This day and time so many physicians only treat the symptoms,Dr. Jackson finds and treats the problem itself.

What a nice surprise to find a good ENT here. Quick appointment, I was called in quickly, and had all my concerns answered by the doctor, who did not act rushed. I called later because of a reaction to a salve, was taken off of that one and the office called me later to see how I was doing. This is the way it used to be and I couldn’t be happier.< /text>

Throughout the 1990s I took my young son to Dr. Jackson. He was my son's favorite doctor for a good reason. I now see Dr. Jackson for myself. Dr. Jackson was and is an excellent doctor who will treat you (and your child) with respect. He is patient, kind and will explain things so you understand. Most of all, I trust Dr. Jackson wholeheartedly and without hesitation. Thank you, Dr. Jackson.</review>

Dr. Jackson's office staff is very friendly and efficient. They were able to get me a new patient appointment within a week. Dr. Jackson's exam is very thorough and his expertise has helped me with a serious sinus infection. I am looking forward to my followup appointment to address a long-term solution. His bedside manner is reminiscent of a small town doctor who knows all of his patients personally. I felt very cared for and heard during the appointment.</review>

Dr Jackson's staff welcomed  me and my little granddaughter with open arms, she had to to come with me because I am her child care provider. They were sweet and kind to her, so sorry to say thats not always the case with other medical offices.  Meeting Dr Jackson for the first time I felt I had known him already for a long time.  His examination was thorough  and complete.</review>

I have been fortunate to know and have been treated by Dr. Robert Jackson for over 24 years. In 1990, I was having sever sinus infections that seemed to repeat two to three times a year. I went to Dr. Jackson,  when he was referred to me by my family doctor.

Dr. Jackson examined me and prescribed a general sinus clean out procedure. Shortly after that was accomplished, he called me in for a consultation and told me that he found further problems that were serious; but that He could correct. He performed that surgery and I have been much healthier, with no recurring infections and feeling much better.

I see Dr. Jackson checks me on a regular basis, as a follow up to that procedure. I  recommend him highly.  I feel he is an excellent doctor and surgeon, and he is a personable man, who is clearly interested in the well being of his patients.

Dr. Jackson ENT, Antiquated record system

I called to follow-up on a RX for a hearing aid for my Mom. The staff member could not find any record for my Mom. Dr. Jackson was her last ENT, but they claim they use a paper based record system.  I suppose Dr. Jackson doesn't realize that it is currently 2019, almost 2020 !

The office manager stated and could only tell  me that Dr. Jackson discharged my Mom as a patient due to non-compliance, but for what ?  They couldn't tell me because their paper records are stored away :)  Unbelievable...and unacceptable to be in business today as a medical physician specialist without an electronic records system.< /text>

I have been to alot of doctors due to my back problems, what a delightful surprise it was to go to Dr. Jackson's office, when I thought i broke my eardrum.

He and his whole staff are the most wonderful crew.

First time in forever I had a doctors 100 percent attention. His devices are scary, but I made it through.< /text>

< Review>
This doctor is practicing insurance fraud. He charges your insurance for in house surgery every time you get your nose cleaned. You need to see another doctor to make sure you get a culture test to know what you are up against. This is malpractice and you need to avoid this place at all costs. get a second opinion asap if you go here.< /Review>

My wife went to see Dr. Jackson about 20 years ago due to extreme hearing loss, he checked her out and told use what the problem was, her hearing was already over 50% irreplacably gone, we had been to others doctors prior to seeing Dr. Jackson, and had been told that nothing could be done, and she would be totally deaf within 2 years. Dr. Said that he thought he could save what was left of her hearing. He preformed surgery on her inter ears, and now 20 years later her hearing is the the same as it was at the time he did the operations. Had we been able to go to him a few years earlier she probably wouldn't have had the  irreplaceable damage she has. Any  how I went to see him today because of a sinus problem, his staff was pleasant and Dr. Jackson,  was as nice as I remember him back from 20 years ago. He said that I hd a sinus infection,  and is now treating it I have great conference that the problem will get cleared up. If you are in need of a really great ENT Doctor,  do not hesitate to go see him and his staff. Very highly recommended. John Rehklau<//text>

<Text>I have been a patient of Dr. Jackson's for over twenty years.  He successfully treated my chronic sinus condition.  To this day, I have not had a problem from what was once a very difficult condition.  I enjoy visiting the office as Dr. jackson is very professional and knowledgeable while also being very friendly.  I always am made to feel he has time to listen and help me.  The office staff is equally friendly and professional.  I value Dr. jackson's services that, even though I have moved to Nevada, I travel back to Palmdale to receive his services rather than change doctors.</Text>< Pics>

Dr. Jackson is, of course, an extremely able and experienced otolaryngologist. This, combined with a very warm and friendly manner, and his obvious concern and interest in his patients, makes my every visit to him a real pleasure.<//Review>

<Text>I just stopped for an icee or "freeze" as it's called there...I liked that the cups/lids/straws are still out for us to get on our own BUT there's no sanitizer for customers to use before handling items (I had forgot mine at home) there was a dirty wet rag on the counter idk what's up with that...I got a large blue freeze since all the other flavors were nowhere near frozen Bummer! Also got a xxl cherry coke sadly when I got home it tasted nothing like cherry coke, syrup & carbonation was there but it tasted fruity like another flavor was run on that line...they need to get rid of them panhandlers outside their doors</Text>< time>

Food was lukewarm at best and the fish sandwich had pretty much no sauce. Went to ask for a little extra or even some mayo so it wasn't dry and was told I'd be charged for it.</review>

Hotdog should supposed to be with no onion - I'm allergic to onion and the red fresh onion was there - i needed to throw the hotdog away due to that. I do not recommend this restaurant.< /text>< response>

I always order the boneless wings with a #KoolAid #slushie (my secret happiness in a cup)!
You've got to try this combo, you'll be so satisfied, plus they have 8 flavors to choose from for your wings! Meat is always white and juicy 👌🏾😁😋 @checkersrallys</Review>

<Review>It's okay!

The drive thru went into the street, and the wait time was long. About 10 minutes? 10 minutes to order, and then another 10 waiting for my food.

The soda was flat, and they had to check with me at the window what my order was, but at least they're making sure I don't leave without my food, so I greatly appreciate it!

The burger was still hot and delicious! I ordered the Buford, and it was just what I wanted!

The fries were soft, lukewarm, and kind of average tasting. They look really good with all that spice on em, but the crunch isn't satisfying, and the flavor is kind of bland.

I ordered mozzarella sticks, but they were out. I don't blame them, though, cause I came in at 9 pm xD

I also ordered the garlic chicken wings, which were SO good, the sauce actually tastes like it's made with real garlic, but the packaging is leaky. My home is only 10 minutes away, but the bottom of the bag was soaked with greasy sauce from the wings, and now I have this majorly huge, garlic-smelling grease stain on the front passenger seat of my car :/

It's definitely a place I'll revisit, but I don't think it's at the top of my list.< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

<Review>Number one the customer service was extremely horrible. My husband and myself used the walk up. We stood there for 15-20 before anyone even acknowledged us.  Finally my husband had to knock on the window to get their attention (it wasn't even busy like that including the drive thru). Number two we finally get our food and it was cold. The fries were stale, and what's going on with the new seasonings on the burgers and fries? I remember when Rally's was great. Great food and customer service. The Rally's now a days is extremely horrible and should be closed down. Needless to say me and my family will never go back. 10/10/19 Someone from corporate contacted me apologizing for my experience and offered me two free meals, that was almost two months ago and I still haven't received what was promised to me. Rally's is horrible.</Review>< pics>

The food is bought you would expect from cheap fast food but the speed of service was absolutely atrocious talking 15 plus minutes to order and 15 to get our food and there was literally no one in front of us but they kept getting people through the drive-thru so it took forever to actually place an order at the walk-up window.<//review>

Went pretty far out of my way because I haven't had their fries since childhood. Once I got their I realized it was just another burger joint.  Tasted fine and the price was $8 for a meal, which is your usual burger joint pricing.  But again, it tasted like any other burger king orJack's, except way farther away.<//Review>

Just ordered a chicken sandwich, and I got an old soggy sandwich. There was literally just breading mostly no chicken at all. Did not look appetizing, I’m sorry but not even McDonald’s sells chicken sandwiches with that bad quality. Seriously, get it together Rallys!</review>

Whats can I say its Rally's in heart of Logan Heights!!  Now you dont have to drive far like to Spring Valley or Imperial Beach. Now you can get what you might call a "Unique So N So Hamburger Taste."
I recommend the fries and sums it up for me. This spot has a benches and the staff is nice only when the order is right. 😏</text>

The quality of food is excellent! But the wait was a little long. They take care of the drive thru first. And to top it off, they forgot my damn apple pie!!! Tsk!< /Review>

<review>REALLY?! Google says you're open until 3am, however I'm not able to order something from drive-thru at 2:30am? Pick-up only?! What does this mean? Wasn't able to call an order in, so, seems kinda counterproductive. What do you have to say for yourselves?</review><pics>None< /pics>< Gmap_id>

<text>Horrible!!! I work until 2 nightly and have come by this location half a dozen times between 2:15 and 2:45 only to be told to go away, we're only accepting doordash, uber and whatever else called in ahead of time pickup there is. Then why does your website say your open until 3 in the morning!!! I race there from down south only to be turned away! This is NOT right! Please stop falsely publicly posting your hours that your open until 3 in the morning daily!<//text>< user_id>

< review>
I have always loved Rally's restaurants so the difference for me is the service, environment and location.
Service was quick and friendly. Everyone there smiles.
Environment was nice, tables outside and the drive thru was moving along nicely.
Location was a little out of the way on a single lane street, however I have never seen a line of backup. Parking is not a problem.
Enjoy!</review>

They are pretty darn good for a restaurant that accepts EBT. But make sure you don't go through the drive through if you are using EBT, they will make you come up to the window.< /Text>

The service is always friendly and the order is always correct! No matter what time they are always on point. Being in Logan you would think the staff would slack but quite the opposite.< /Review>

<Review>I was shockingly disappointed with the burgers because they just didn't taste as good. Maybe a bad first impression. However the fries and especially the mozzarella stick were really good. I'll retry later.</Review>< pics>

I received a small burger and fries that looked like they were from the dollar menu, combo was like $8 ! Also for the chicken bites boxes they didnt even bother to put ranch in the bag ! Ridiculous. So disappointed. Hopefully they pay attention to detail and fulfill the customers needs and wants, since they are paying for their services. In the pic it shows almost no fries, my kids ate some but they werent even filled to the top as they should</Review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

They failed again to get my order right, they charge for condiments and I absolutely hate it when fast food places try to tell me they dont have soda water.   Yes you do, it's the water they mix the syrup with .   Avoid this fast food chain.<//Review>

It is a rarity that I stop in at a Rally's or Checkers. That very much is true. Another truth is that there are not many of them. That is perfectly fine by me, and it makes each visit worthwhile. I had the baconzilla combo. Bacon and cheese and the beef patty and the bun were very much as I remembered the last time I had it. Very straightforward. All stacked in a choreographed pile of goodness. My burger this time was no different. It had a good amount of bacon which provided the right amount of saltiness to compliment the beef patties and the melted cheese. The bacon had a good amount of crispiness too. The seasoned fries are a step above any other fast food restaurant standard french fries. Of course if you prefer seasoned fries. Which I do, and mine were done perfectly. I also had a strawberry smoothie that was very..... smooth with just the right amount of sweetness. Rally's and Checker's offer soft serve and other dessert items too. So on hot days it is worth checking out. Outside seating is only available. It is a very modern location and parking is available and well lit.</text>

<Review>Food was awesome like always except I asked for no cheese or cheese sauce on my Roadhouse bacon burgers.  One had cheese and there other didn't. Drove couple miles to get to this location and on the way there I saw at least seven to eight Police cruisers.  Went to drive through and as I was leaving I didn't check my order because I saw a group of suspicious men very close to drive thru exit.</Review>< pictures>

<Date>1551586568867< /Date><Rating>3<//Rating><text>I've been a big fan of Rally's since I was teenager about 26 summers ago, so was glad to hear this Rally's was close to us. Drive Thru is poorly designed. Only 3 cars fit from the ordering speaker to the drive up window. That coupled with very, very (almost dmv'esque) slow and "don't bother me service" , we ended with a 26 minute wait start to finish as car #5 in the drive thru. Probably should give 2 Stars but in all honesty for the price the food was pretty good, an excellent value. This Rally's has alot of potential, with the right manager who can keep the employees happy, motivated and productive. Could really be an asset to helping the local community. Will come back again and maybe order at pick up window and see what happens. Was also very clean and well maintained on the outside at least.</text>< pictures>

I don't recommend this place if you want fast food.  It's ridiculously fat. Like juicy gross fat. Even the bread is soaked in fat.  Hardly finished my 🍔. Try to find another place across the street.  It's pretty cheap though.</review>

<date>1505944649384</date><rating>1</rating><text>This place sucks! They had the Steak Burgers on sale for $1.99. So I ordered one at the drive thru. The girl asked me if I'd like the 2 for $6.00 deal, lol. The burger itself was over cooked and really small (much smaller than the bun) and had funky tasting grilled onions instead of the crispy fried onions that it shows on the poster.  Even at $1.99 it was a disappointment. Also the people could be a little friendlier and quit trying to screw people with the funny math.</text>< pictures>

<Text>Earlier today I stopped by to enjoy the BBq Mushroom Burger I had seen advertised.. it looked Delicious minus the Beef however.. I didnt see that as a problem since every fast food place in America I've visited will allow you to pay or even courtesy swap the Protein. Well.. not this establishment, I am disappointed not only at that but the service I received. When I asked for a manager to answer why this could not be done, the young man that came to the Drive thru window to answer the question in the Managerial position responded with a loosely "Yea" instead of "Hello, How can I help you? We can't do it because of inventory was my response"...I have been in Customer Service over 25 yrs.. not acceptable.. Rallys.. train your associates better and think of a better way to satisfy your customers that do not eat Red meat.
Thank you.<//Text><UserId.>118003918130989762116< /UserId.>< response>
