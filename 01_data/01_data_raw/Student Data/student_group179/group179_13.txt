Absolutely horrible they delivered my pizza to an address I don't live over 3 years ago. I spoke to Megan all she could do is return my money. the house that I live inis about maybe 10 minutes away from the other address. One is closer to them than the other and they still refuse to deliver it. How sad 😥.  Hungry AAMF too OMG, AND it was Easter yo. Thanks for the pizza Megan. IT probably was  smelling good too...< /Review>

Worst experience I ever had, ordered a pizza they said they will deliver it in 25 mints. Waited an hour then called them, they told me I wasn’t in their delivery zone. I am literally 2 mile away from them. They need to respect people’s time.<//Text>

<Review>I ordered using the mobile app. The app told me it's being prepared and would take around 30-45 minutes. I go in to the store to pay and the cashier told me an it's going to be atleast another 1 hr to 1.5 hrs. Does it really take that long to cook a large thin crust with already cooked chicken, bacon and sausage? I told them I'm going across the street to buy frozen pizza and it will be done cooking 5x faster. I took it home and it's a 15 minute bake from frozen.< /Review>< Pics>

Place is a bit compressed, not leaving a lot of room. The seats are very compact in a tight area and the boxes are handed directly from the side counter where you would have to squeeze past other customers on a busy day. They should consider remodeling. However, the service was great and the employees are pretty norm.< /Text>

<text>Refreshing change!  I had started thinking of Domino's more like the cable company - we'll get it to you sometime next week between 8 am and 8 pm. My order was processed and at my door in less than 1/2 an hour,  very nice! Additionally,  their pizza was starting to be as appetizing as the box it's served in,  or Chuck e' Cheese pizza,  usually the former is slightly better - that has changed as well : their pizza is now very tasty and enjoyable!  Nice turn-around for a chain I had all but given up on.</text>< gmap_id>

I asked well were you planning on calling at any point to let me know what was going on and they said no.

<Review>I have ordered pizza from this store on two separate occasions and both times were easily the worst service I've had.
The first time my pizza was burnt to a crisp, cold to the touch, and looked like it had been thrown into the car from across the parking lot.
The second time it was marked as delivered nearly an hour before I received it.
Save yourself some time and frustration by ordering from literally anywhere else.<//Review>< Pics>

My local Domino's Pizza store gets my order correct 95% of the time, and does so in a timely fashion. They have never messed up my pizza or my dessert. But a few times when I have ordered a 2-Liter soft drink they have either forgotten it or or showed up at my door with a 20oz soft drink instead. However, they have always promptly driven back to the store and then back to my house in less than 30 minutes. They have never refused to correct the drink situation, and they have never messed up the meal portion. I don't mind sipping on water while I eat and wait for them to return with the correct drink size.< /Text>

Our friend called  they answered and he got the managers name (Izaiah or Elijah ?) Sorry but this is not how you treat customers. The owners of this establishment should be ashamed for allowing this nonsense to continue. Looking at the comments this has been an on going issue for far to long.< /Review>< resp>

The customer service here sucks!  I order two pizzas with a buffalo chicken wings that were boneless, and the results of my order was not what I want so I wanted to change and get another one. Basically I was not satisfied with my wings, and so I wanted to return it and get another one. But, when I called Dominos, the manager was rude to me and my mom,
plus he gave us attitude and said that it was my fault. That is not how you treat your customers and I highly believe their overall customer service was terrible. I do not recommend this place to others.</Text>

Really the only option like this for a loooooong ways. But it's really a pretty nice spot to hang out at, and a real boon for rotation units to get PC access, a bite, and take your mind off the box for a bit.<//review>

<rating>3<//rating><text>The Warrior Zone is great for entertainment, but the Habañero Cafe within the warrior zone is mediocre at best. Servicemembers aren't allowed to bring in any outside food or drink because of the cafe. They sell tacos, burritos and quesadillas that are about as good as Taco Bell. No free refills on sodas, and the meat sits around in open slow cookers for hours. Energy drinks cost about a dollar more than you would pay for at the gas station that is two minutes walking distance away.<//text>< Pictures>

<name>Yang Xi< /name><userid>108093657631430836230< /userid><review>Same feedback with the other tenants. Moving-in is probably the only time they actively replied my messages. I had to call the office everyday for a week for them to confirm our move-out. Then, we were unfairly charged a whooping move-out fee for the paint despite we stayed in the apartment for over 4 years. Then the agent, Jeannie, without following up with our dispute, sent our bill straight to a collection company who harrasses us everyday.

We consulted an attorney and decided to sue Legacy Property Management. What's more frustrating is they are now "working remotely indefinitely because of covid", so it's literally impossible to get them respond even to a lawsuit. No answering phone calls / emails. Can't deliver mails. No one in the office.

TO TENANTS  -  Avoid! If you are already a tenant, have an attorney ready when you are planning to move out.

TO LANDLORDS - If you think this is fine, and don't care about your tenants. Good luck trusting your property to someone you can hardly find.

TO OWNER DERRICK - If you truly believe your way of running the business is legit, just come out and accept the service. I'd be more than happy to discuss this with you in the court!</review>< response>

I was scheduled to view a rental property listed by this company. The agent never showed up, did not communicate in advance regarding change of timing and did not pick her cell phone. They are also very unresponsive, taking 5+ days to respond to a simple viewing query on Zillow. I would not recommend any home owner to use them to manage their property. They are turning away potential tenants and buyers with their unprofessionalism.<//Text>

The agents here are horrible! I have an appointment made in a property in SJ, spent an hour on the way, 40 minutes waiting outside. No one showed, and no body ever answers the phone. Finally when it get through, they denied the appointment and hang up my call. No business ethics and the most terrible experience I EVER  HAD.<//Review>

Awesome team of property managers. Very diligent in working with tenants and vendors. Been working with Legacy for 5 years now, the communication is always easy and they are very responsive. Would highly recommend them.< /review>

<Text>Ryan and Kelly were referred to me by a friend. They came highly recommended and I am so glad I have them as my property managers. This is my first time renting my home and they made the process fairly straight forward and painless. I was nervous about it, but they have procedures in place that assure me my home will be kept up and the lease agreement gives me confidence that we have good and reliable tenants. Ryan and Kelly are usually available by text/phone and always get back to me quickly too. I recommend this company and these two in particular to care for your property.< /Text><rate>5</rate>< resp>

The people at Legacy Property Management go above and beyond. I don't think I could be more impressed with how good of a job they have done for me. I've used their service for almost a year and a half and have not had one issue and they have always been prompt with communication.</review>

Derrick and Legacy Property Management are real professionals-- they really know their stuff and are very responsive to inquiries and concerns. Derrick walked me through an eviction and his thorough knowledge of the process was very apparent. I would not hesitate to entrust them with my properties and recommend their services to all.</text>

Professional property management group. Always treated us with respect, and was responsive to all requests and inquiries. Their online portal to make payments and arrange maintenance appointments made life as a tenant effortless.

Thanks Legacy, wish we still had you as our management group!<//Review>

I've enjoyed working with Jeannie H. who helped me through the process of getting my home ready as a rental. She estimated what rental income I could expect and, in no time, found tenants for that amount. The online system that her company is using to keep track of expenses and income is fabulous and makes my out-of-state landlord-life so easy.< /text>

<Text>Kelly went above & beyond to show how invested she was in getting our son into a safe home, while he is away attending college.  She responds all hours of the day/night, providing excellent customer service and peace of mind!   Kelly & Ryan gave our boys (son/roommate) the respect and trust they deserve.  When working with them, you really feel like more then just a client.  We're so thankful to have had their assistance and guidance!</Text>< Pictures>

When my real estate clients have a vacancy or need property management they can rely on, Quincy Sanders at Legacy is my go-to person. No one else has provided the immediate response and creative energy that Quincy brings to the table every time.< /text>

Even though I ultimately decided to sell my house instead of rent it out, Derrick and his team were incredibly professional, efficient, and easy to work with while going through the process of staging, listing, finding tenants, and negotiating rates.  My next rental property in the area will undoubtedly be handled through Legacy Property Group.<//review>

We were looking at a property in Sunnyvale and contacted Legacy Property several times. Finally I was able to get in touch with the office. The office staff employee who picked up the call was extremely rude and truly came across as a racist!

She had absolutely no customer service skills and basic etiquette. She talked over me and at one point asked me if i sent a gif/gift card??. I heard gift card so I asked her to clarify. She again spoke over me and rudely said " NOT A GIFT CARD. A GIF CARD - WITH your PHONE number and INFO". I had just started responding and SHE spoke all ove rme again!! I realized even if we like this property, we would have to deal with this kind of property management company. Plenty of properties in the Bay Area. My family and I are not dealing with this.<//text>

You will NEVER reach a live person on the phone if you call. Many listings are not accurate or not available.  You have to fill out a $50 application before you even get to reach a live person or see a property.  They make more money on applications than rent.  Think about that.<//Review>

< review>
Despite generally great reviews, I personally have had an extremely frustrating experience with an agent (Quincy). I'm looking to relocate from out of state for a new job in the bay area, and my wife and I decided to rent for the first year before deciding on a location to buy. I'm a current home owner in my home state. I had intially made a call and an email regarding a rental house that we really liked, and had inquired about the property. I received a few messages regarding an open house showing which I could not make due to being out of state currently, and have not received any confirmation nor any answers to requested status update of the rental property. After countless unsuccessful attempts to contact Quincy, the agent, I called the office number to ask about the status of the rental home, so I can move on with househunting. The office receptionist was also unhelpful and couldn't provide any info othet than that Quincy would call back. I was ultimately never contacted. Because my wife and I really liked the advertised home, we put in an application for the house without hearing back or knowing the rental status, continuing to send in requests for information. I was charged for the background check fee yet the rental home was listed unavailable very soon thereafter. Time and money wasted by going through these folks. I've written an email requesting refund of my background check fee based on the timing in which the rental home became unavailable; my application never had a chance. I'll have to see what they decide on my request; it honestly has nothing to do with the dollar amount of the fee but the principles of the whole situation. All that needed to be done on their part was a very quick email or text or phone call to tell us yes or no so we knew to continue to look elsewhere but they simply decided we weren't worth their time. I understand that one agent may be an anomaly out of the normal good quality of folks working there, but this one individual and the receptionist absolutely made the entire organization seem extremely unprofessional and too good for the a potential client. I will not be looking for homes through this company, and I personally would never hire individuals like Quincy or the receptionist.<//review>

<Review>The onboarding process with Legacy was quite smooth and they took care of things quite promptly.  The tenants they have found seem to be decent and haven't much problem.  Rent seems to be paid on time, so that's reassuring.  However, we've often experienced errors with statements and there's a bit of going back and forth to get them corrected.  Also, the response to phone calls and email has been rather slow.  We wait for a week, sometimes longer, and we have to follow up again with either another email or phone call, and it still takes at least another couple of days before we hear back.  We find their vendor (plumbing in our case) a bit overpriced, especially for fixing things that seem minute.  Overall, we are ok with their service, but definitely expected more in return for the management fee we are paying.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x808fb0aa64f85cff:0x17404fe80034e0bd< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

It can also be expensive if you experience extended vacancies or are fined for a violation of a law or regulation you may or may not have been aware of. For property management I refer my investor clients to Legacy Property Group. Derrick and his team are professional, up to date with the rental market and well versed with rental laws and regulations throughout the Bay Area. Legacy Property Group delivers the highest caliber tenants at strong market lease rates and take care of any landlord tenant issues that may arise.

I represent investors in the acquisition and sale of multifamily investment properties. My investors are professionals focused on their careers. They are building passive income and net worth through investing in multifamily rental properties. Most don't desire or have the time to manage their properties. With confidence I refer them to Legacy Property Group.< /Text>< Pictures>

My experience was not reflective of the others here. I requested information and viewing of a listed property multiple times, filled out the information they requested, and they completely ignored me (even after a phone call). Then they took the listing down. Not a very professional experience.<//review>

<text>Nice corner Hawaiian BBQ place. It is a decent fast-food joint with good selection of meats with fried spring rolls and dumplings, BBQ meats flavored with Hawaiian style sauces and musubi. Usually the Hawaiian style BBQ marinates are very sweet, so be aware. Parking is no problem inside Maywood Village Square. It might be hard to spot since there are some palm tree in front. Good place for quick lunch.< /text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPn6eHxh6SOJ1UFDbFPoDEhvYxVJhL3ocVNrzdB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPg1pFjVfrsPxBpTMFceQhOWs1dakRv5cXf5P6i=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN0XrKwaexoJc0h1EhHryFEOEm2YsR61rFtPN51=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN4trC4PnpBdHf2OwJeseWWTwSrs2I5ERybOuQl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPeZyBgosVXe--09VwGHvOj0ot3B-4tJj4ngoV5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipONLzEcoyGb1c7YVU80XsKjY4jdKlPaoMj4MtuL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOij92wMcb_kE1s8mBHG4pJcIVIpvHyMRuvFyHq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNwXsN-kQRgnGWPZnCqDYiudRQWw149FNyA2jDU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

<user_name>Thaddeus T. Taint</user_name><Text>This place only allows me to refill my soda once and when I asked if I could pay for more they said no. I was only allowed to refill my drink if I defeated both cashiers in hand to hand combat. I did not have that second drink. The two cashiers here are very sweet women, but will not hesitate to lift you over their shoulders and break your back on their knees.<//Text>< gmapID>

<text>Chadwick absolutely nailed it! I have no experience with keeping up with my mustache and beard, and my hair was getting far too long to work with. He helped me out with suggestions and a fantastic cut!

Thanks for everything, Chad! It’s perfect!

My first time at this shop was today, met and got my cut from Jameson absolutely quality work, amazing atmosphere and serious passion behind this place. From the art on the walls, the conversation that flows through, the attention to detail and making the effort to make customers feel comfortable this place does not disappoint. Will be coming back as a customer for life.</Text>

It's laid back like the classic feel. You feel like friends when you walk in. Great time and effort on hair cuts. They use razor blade. And the full treatment for a good price</Review>

Great spot. Liked coming on Saturdays cause they offered walk-ins. But they just recently changed to appointments on Saturdays. Not a big deal. Just call before you come in.<//Text>

<text>This place has a great atmosphere and great staff. Johnny was the one who gave my husband a haircut and beard trim. My husband has a hard time letting people trim his beard since so many people don't know how, and we were both super pleased with the outcome and the price for it all!
We are brand new to the area and will definitely be back.</text>< Pictures>

This barbershop is incredible! Johnnie in particular is outstanding and is an absolute artist when it comes to his craft. Free beer, great music, and hilarious wall art really tie the culture together. Come early and expect crowds, these barbers are top notch.</Review>

I've been coming back here, and couldn't be happier. Good group of guys cutting hair - feels like coming into a conversation amongst friends every time I come in. The cuts themselves are excellent, primarily with scissors vs trimmers, and they all know how to straight-edge shave. Walk-ins welcome on some days (call to check), and they have beer for the over-21 crowd, 1 free with a cut. I'm certainly stoked to have a regular place again.< /text>

Started taking my boys there for cuts, then my husband for shaves. All the barbers are polite and professional AND they take their time with the cuts which the end result speaks for itself. My family has never walked out displeased. 1927 has become a favorite and a must for my boys and husband.</text>

I asked no sweet, rose buckwheat milk tea with salted foam. It is too too sweet...... even though without any “sugar”.</review>

Finding the actual place is a little complicated, especially if you have never been to that mall. They do good drinks, and their staff is very friendly. While making drinks the staff play K-pop (Korean pop music) in the background.</review>

Great tea, and I really like the new flavors. The lavender is my favorite right now. The cream top is very sweet and I recommend compensating by getting the tea less sweet. The boba is cooked to perfection.</review>

This was my first time as I tried Bubble Tea, one of my Tea enthusiast friend suggested me to try it. So what could have been better than trying one and only Rabbit brand Bubble tea in the San Jose.
During my visit to this area I ordered one of their popular Bubble tea and at the first sip I was amazed with the taste and quality of ingredients inside the sipper.
It was a completely Tea experience for me but really liked this newly concept Tea.<//text>

The only other place I've been to or seen a Rabbit Rabbit was in Taiwan.

They have a nice selection of fresh drink options that range from traditional to more unique Asian flavours.

I got the Japanese buckwheat milk tea with real taro in the bottom, and it was very filling and tasty!
If I were ever in the area I would go here again.

They're located at a Kiosk on the top floor of the Westfield mall, and there always seemed to be a small line.</text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Very fast service. The seals, cups, and straw combo was very cute and aesthetically pleasing. I got the tiramisu milk tea with 75% sweet and 50% ice. It was pretty good. Very tasty! Only problem I had was that I wish the cashier gave me more of a recommendation because I was obviously new to everything. I would definitely come back though!< /review>

<Text>Bad service, I placed an order via Recipo app an hour ago, but the order wasn’t been able to deliver on time. Actually it was never been delivered and was still in store. So I called the store, however, the servant was very rude and hang off the phone. That’s the most terrrible experience I have.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Make sure you pull up a picture of the menu on your phone so you're ready to order, as the menu is only in the front of the line and very small.

I ordered the Iron Buddha with pearls, which was a bit different than the usual pearls you get. These ones were white but with the texture of the regular black boba you get! It was super delicious.</Text>< user>

so super excited to try this place.  The last few times the line was too long so I didn't wait.  I tried the iron Buddha with pearls, 50% sweetness.  Was good but not amazing.  I liked the pearls better then other places but didn't love the non dairy creamer they use.  It just wasn't rich and creamy like some of the others have tried.  In short I would go there again but if there is a huge line its not worth the wait.< /text>

I appreciate that you can choose your sweetness level and the amount of ice you want. My lychee green tea with boba was perfect- 0% sweet, 50% ice.  No line when we got there, so it was fast ordering and quick drink making.</text>

Long line, waited for 30min, but the milk tea itself tastes bad. We tried the Tiramisu and the mojito.</Text>

<review>(Translated by Google) The shop is on the second floor of the shopping plaza, like a roadside stall. I ordered pearl milk tea, 25% sugar and de-icing. The milk tea is creamer milk tea. The taste is the same as that of a Taiwanese hand shake. The pearls are transparent and have a good taste. Overall it tastes good, but the price is slightly higher.

店舖在購物廣場的二樓，像是一個路邊的攤位。我點了珍珠奶茶，25%的糖跟去冰，奶茶是奶精奶茶，味道跟台灣手搖飲料的味道一樣，珍珠是透明的，口感不錯。整體來說味道不錯，只是價位稍高一點。</review>< Pics>

Best service I've ever experienced in my entire life! Water was never empty, bread bowl was always full.

The meat here is so good, you really can't go wrong with any of the cuts!! Come hungry so you can fill up. For the sides, the soups were so good. I couldn't help myself to many servings of it!< /Review>

I guess it was just the night I came, but there was this metal band playing in there so it was extremely loud. The beer was good and bartenders were nice. However, if you're looking for a place to just chill and have a conversation, this might not be the best place to do that.< /text>

Always a fun time at Flaming Saddles! It’s one of those places that I always being friends who are visiting Los Angeles. The music is a mix, sometimes they play a banger then play a song that kills the vibe, the song transitions could definitely use work. I do love the versatility of the space, my favorite way to spend a weekend is dancing the night away on Saturday night then coming back for brunch. They definitely cover all the bases well.</Text>

So many empty tables that you aren’t allowed to sit at. I have a disability that isn’t directly visible; my femur was shattered a few years ago in a car accident so i have difficulty with balance and pain when standing for long periods of time. I came for drag race on a Friday and was having a great time at the beginning (Ongina was an amazing host). Per usual , my disabled leg gets sharp pain after standing for awhile so I sat down at a table and seconds later some queen comes up to me telling me I can’t sit there because it’s reserved for his group (btw his group is just standing around the table not sitting). I tried reasoning with him, exchanged a few sour words, but ultimately after he showed me a crumpled 8.5 x 11 reservation I got up from their seat and stood to watch the show. this wasn’t enough for him. he asked me to move away from his table which was in the middle of the bar and I declined. I’m not sure if he is close to management, but he walked away and a few minutes later he returned with security who told me I had to leave. I tried explaining my point and in the midst of my frustration, my knee buckled (this is common and it’s something I’m used to). I was laughed at  by security and the group for my disability and called a drunk so I just ended up leaving willingly. I didn’t get any names but this was a really humiliating experience for me in a place I’m supposed to consider a “safe space”. Shame.<//Text>

We LOVE Flaming Saddles! My sister celebrated her birthday there and everything went well until we got our check. There was a misunderstanding but our server, Natalie, was so lovely and fixed the issue promptly and so did the manager, Russel. There was one woman working there who I didn’t get the name of but she was unfortunately very pushy and rude to us while we were trying to figure everything out. I did not get her name but that is the only thing we’re disappointed in from our evening there. I hope that she is held accountable for her actions. Thank you, Natalie, for being an amazing server and for making our night unforgettable!<//review>

I'm not someone who goes to bars often, but I was in LA and definitely wanted to give one a try. I want to start by saying the bouncer was amazing, very friendly and set me up with high expectations. Unfortunately that's where the good experiences end, I dont know if bars are usually like this, but when me and my friend walked in there there were empty tables everywhere and all were reserved, so our only option was to stand awkwardly in the back of a crowd of people at the bar, so we understandably wanted to leave, however I felt a little bad going in there and not getting at least one drink. So when the waiter came up he was friendly at first, until I told him we were only getting one drink on a closed tab, his whole attitude changed, we got dirty looks from him the 10 mins we were there and the check was tossed at the table as he went by. I still gave a tip because I dont believe in not tipping but overall terrible first experience at a bar wont be coming back, the only thing keeping me from 1 star was the awesome bouncer.< /text>

Something for everybody...

So much fun!  I think there was just about every type of person here, dancing and singing along to every type of music all mixed together.  Male and female dancers on stage and in the air over the crowd.  Pretty good drinks prices.< /Text>

Drinks are strong and there is a large variety. The atmosphere was very accepting for gay and straight alliances and the staff was very outgoing. The dancer on stage was very fun to look at. I only saw one female dancer on stage but she was there for a short time .I would have loved to see more of her. Outside the place be cautious . Some weird guy came up to me and told me repeatedly that he was gay and then proceeded to kiss me and touch me inappropriately.</Review><Response>None</Response>< user>

<Text>I stopped by on Tuesday evening and had the best experience. I had been in before but had never eaten there. I was very hungry and had seen the menu on line.  The staff are so friendly and greet you with a smile when you walk in.  I've lived in West Hollywood for 19 years and you don't always get that.
My server; Taylor was the best. He made my experience so great.  He was so friendly and attentive.
I look forward to coming back to enjoy the great service that was provide by Taylor and to feel welcomed as I felt on Tuesday evening.< /Text>< name>

We went there for its karaoke night on Monday. My friend reached out for a song slot for me but the DJ was really rude because he wasn’t able to hear what my friend was saying and he assumed him as an Asian were not good at English(which would be totally reasonable). He was absolutely impatient during the communication. Later on, when it was my time to sing, I’m 100% sure the DJ put down the volume of the mic to give us a hard time and i wasn’t even be able to hear what i was singing. The whole performance of was awkward and the DJ still insisted the mic was normal.

Never come back to this place again. We talk about equality in the real world but somehow the discrimination within our community is even worse.<//Review>

<review>I went to flaming saddles this past Labor Day weekend for the West Hollywood Sports Festival after party and had a great time. The DJ was great and the my bartender was spectacular and offered recommendations. The person who made the night even more memorable was Maylin, the photographer.< /review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Good energy, and great staff in a place big enough for groups. Shows are obviously cheesy, but thats kindof the point.< /Review>

What,  you don't know how to make an Old Fashioned?!?  Better step up your game before your clientele goes for more professional quarters.  Bright spot: the atmosphere here is truly "fun country"; DJ and dancers are worth suffering the lack of a 'sophisticated' drink.<//text>

<Text>I have only been here a handful of times but the last time I went a few years ago, few of my friends and I ordered a round of shots. The bartender (don't know his name) brought up the fact that we hadn't tipped yet, meanwhile we had JUST got there. Then he went on and on about how rude it was that we didn't tip and that apparently we were there the week before and we didn't tip then. Before this night, I had not been there in months and I had told him that and he got really aggressive and defensive. I got up and left. Never went back<//Text>< username>

It's one of my favorite gay bars in New York but the Los Angeles outpost doesn't light a candle to the original. If you want to see shirtless men in chaps dancing on tables, you'll have a blast.<//review>

Call me old fashioned but I like my gay bars that are located in my gay village to be owned and operated by gay people. I can sense  it when i'm in an establishment that feels like their heart is not really with my community.<//text>

Terrible, particularly compared to the NYC version which is the best bar in NYC. This one does EVERYTHING wrong that the NYC one does well. First of all the music is WAY too loud- one reason I like the NYC one is i can actually hear my friends talk to me while we drink and have fun and watch the dancers. But worst of all, the LA one didn't play a SINGLE country song! What the hell!? The whole idea of flaming saddles is the exclusive country music and the dancing bar tenders. The bar tenders in NYC are so much hotter, more down to earth and don't take themselves so seriously. The ones in LA need to be more like that. Get it right!< /review>

It's about time a country bar finally made its way to West Hollywood! Modeled after the bar in Coyote Ugly, this bar features cowboy bartenders periodically dancing on the bar and tables. Great music and friendly staff.</text>

It's not the same as the original location in NYC's Hell's Kitchen, but the Western twist on WeHo is amusing, if not a break from the mold here.<//review>

Absolutely fun spot. Sit watch nature, fish, swim, read a book this is a nice spot. Not room for a lot of people but enough for a few. Trash recepticles and picnic to tables.</review>

I've been going to Donner Lake since I was a small child.  It's a lot more crowded than it was then. Weekends are very crowded and now that there are so many people around, and houses built it can be a challenge to get a parking spot.  It's a beautiful lake though and everyone should visit the nearby Donner Memorial Museum at least once to learn the history of the area and the Donner Party.</text>

<Text>Most excellent view of Donner Lake. Many private property, private piers so risky to stop or use.  Donner country beauty getting harder to find.< /Text>< UserId.>

<review>Great location. Small ramp for SUP/KAYAK, etc. Picnic tables, parking lot, and street parking. Public restroom that altho is not pretty, is very clean. Lots of shade. Floating dock you can swim to for laying in the sun. Very casual, simpler & easier than going to the State beach. Clean, ample trash bins, and great spots to fish. We took our 3 yo for a picnic and it was very easy!</review>< Name>

I liked Lake Donner. Super cold water, but also transparent, quiet, immersed in natural beauty. And we had a nice family picnic here.< /text>

Beautiful views the train runs along the ridge above and the views make awsome pictures, the sunrises and sunsets can be spectacular.The clear cold water is refreshing on hot days can be a little numbing on cooler days even with a wetsuit, good fishing certain times of year. There is a boat launch. Paddleboarding is a fun thing to do along with kayaking or canoes but the busy days theres too many motorized boats making wakes.  Theres not alot of parking so when it gets busy people block roads and driveways where they shouldnt park. They should be mindful of the locals who take care of this place year round. Its very clean please keep it that way. There are bathrooms and trash receptacles all over so please if you visit too clean up and leave it like you found it.< /Text>

Love Shoreline Park.  It is serene, peaceful, quiet and has plenty of shade, has BBQ grills, picnic tables, and is dog friendly. It is one of my favorite places for R&R. Can sit here all day enjoying the scenic mountain views and watching the various water sports. The lake is beautiful with very clear water.  Will be coming here more often. Weekends are usually more crowded so come early.<//Text>

There is no vehicle access to the ramp though, it's only for non-motorized watercraft. There are restrooms, trash bins and picnic tables at this spot too. Lots of people like to fish here. It's not the most scenic part of the lake for paddling, but it's free and easy access!<//text>< Rating>

< Review>
This company saved the day!  They were kind and flexible.  Three men with a big box truck arrived with smiles, tools and a great work ethic.  Communication flowed smoothly among them and a big moving job was completed In two hours.  Highly recommend this company.  Jose Vargas, Jonathan Perez and Gabriel were fantastic.<//Review>

<Text>We just had a couch that we kept in storage with "make space" delivered to our house today. A plank of wood on the ottoman was completely ripped off. This couch was in NEW condition considering we put it in storage 1 month after buying it. The people who delivered it told us "yeah, it probably broke because you wrapped up the couch" - are you kidding me?

I'd assume that if your ONE job is to store things and keep them safe then something like this should never happen but now we are being told its our fault because we wrapped it to keep it safe. It's extremely disappointing to know that we paid for a service that in the end was essentially useless. I would have much rather just let a friend use it if I knew this was how "Make Space" was going to handle our things. Would not recommend this company to anyone even if its affordable, think about it guys, there's a reason why....</Text>< name>

Amazing experience with MakeSpace. From booking to picking up, the experience was flawless. They made it extremely easy for me from beginning to end. Nora was an amazing rep who was really patient with all my questions as it was my first move. Raul and Damian arrived right on schedule and were so extremely helpful and patient packing the items. Really nice and genuine people. They helped way more than i expected and made it so easy on me. Great company, great employees. Couldn’t be any happier. Thank you!< /Text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Text>I’ve had back surgery and can not move myself.  MakeSpace Storage seemed like the perfect place to go.

I bought new medium boxes and small extra thick boxes for books, packed them where I’d placed them ... numbered them and then called to have all the 22 boxes stored with MakeSpace. This was the first couple days in August of 2018.

September 25, 2018 I moved, and setup delivery of ALL medium boxes to be delivered on December 9, 2018.

I had some important things in my medium boxes so on their site I pulled up each picture making sure to click (select) ALL the medium boxes. December 9 came and I received the medium boxes the next week when not working I worked on emptying those boxes... I then realized a box was missing and looked on the app to see which box I hadn’t picked and couldn’t find any medium sized box left on their site. I contacted them and was told they would look into it. The next day it was back on the app and my trust of them had vanished I had work, a couple of holidays and a vacation planned so the soonest I could take delivery of the remaining boxes was January 3, 2019.

When I received the boxes the 1 medium box was smashed waterlogged and half the contents were missing. Several of the small boxes the tape looked like it had been tampered with ie new different tape and one of the small boxes now had a triangle cut in the side of it.

Makespace has offered to settle for 80 cents per destroyed or damaged box!

Missing was 5 years worth of bills, taxes, divorce documents, Passport, Various drivers licenses (name changed)...

I’ve asked for identity protection and they site these things should not have been sent to storage. If they are reputable those items should be safe!

Why was THAT box removed from their site?

They are not trustworthy nor do they stand behind proper storage practices! What difference does it make what is in the boxes?

Only thieves would do what they did!!

DO NOT TRUST THEM WITH ANYTHING!!

And now they are offering free storage boxes... to make accessing your personal thing easier?!?! Lol

In terms of pick up and movers, the service was great! I had Raul and Luis B and they were communicative, efficient and helped getting everything packed up securely. I would highly recommend them.  Customer service (Carmela & Connor) was helpful with all the questions I had leading up to moving and with getting my items out of storage. I do wish there wasn't a 3 month minimum to using the storage facility. I also did not appreciate the added monthly fees after discussing a set price before having my items picked. Hopefully this info can help anyone looking to use this service.<//Review>

Anything quoted over the phone is simply an estimate. Please contact our Customer Support team if you'd like to speak to someone further about this. I do see that the items listed on your pickup were double that from when they were quotes. The pick up is still processing and the team will check for any discrepancies in measurements once the items are fully processed.\n\nTake care,\nThe MakeSpace Team"}< /response>< GmapID>

Super easy and convenient. If you don’t want to get movers and a truck for things you don’t need often, this is a great option for storing. The only reason I left MakeSpace was because I needed a storage unit that I can access frequently. 👍🏽<//review>

<review>I would not recommend this service to anyone. They took my bed apart and then lost the necessary hardware to put it back together. They have been very unhelpful and have left me no choice but to leave a review so that others don't make the same mistake I did, here is what happened:

I was moving and needed a place to store my bedroom set for a few months. I took out their most expensive insurance policy. When the movers came to take my furniture they had to disassemble my bed. When I was ready to move in to my new apartment, they delivered the pieces of my bed, but not the screws and bolts they removed during disassembly. After numerous calls, and hours spent on hold, the company has not offered much help. They said that the screws and hardware would normally be taped to the bed (they were not), they could offer me a $50 credit (for a $500 bed), and that it could take 4 weeks for the claims department to get back to me. Unfortunately, the hardware for my bed is very specific to the model and is no longer being sold, meaning the bed is useless and cannot be fixed. I am now forced to buy a new bed without any guarantee that the company will pay for their mistake. If you are looking for movers or storage, I would recommend looking elsewhere.< /review>< response>

2 years ago I needed to move. Rental contract not renewed (making way for a remodel and a $1,200.00 rent increase). With MakeSpace's help, I was able to quickly pack up what I valued and needed. The MakeSpace team wrapped, lifted, and loaded for me. Today, MakeSpace returned my items to me. Nicholas and Damian were on time, friendly, professional, and safe.
Thanks MakeSpace for making my two year transition smooth.< /Review>

This is my first experience with Make Space and I am so happy I found them. From the first phone call (It was very informative and the terms were explained in a clear and concise manner) to the alerts leading up to pick up. The pick up experience went so smoothly (and I have moved A LOT of times to be able to compare), Raul and Richard T were very professional, efficient and  polite. They treated our stuff with such care, wrapping and protecting every Inch of it. Their system to log in our stuff seemed very organized also. I will be storing with them for the next 3 months so I am not able to review the drop off process but what I have experienced so far has been nothing short of excellent. Thank you Raul and Richard T for such a great experience today! (Thank you to our rep that set us up, apologies but I can't remember her name)< /Text>

<text>We have had a terrible experience with MakeSpace.  The pick up process took three days and they were not communicating with us for most of that time.  This was especially stressful because we were moving out of our condo and traveling and had to extend and pay rent until all the items were out plus hire someone to meet MakeSpace to facilitate the pick up three days after the scheduled pick up.

They moved our items from a warehouse in LA to one in Ontario without telling us.

Now we are trying to get our items back (the entire contents of our 3 bedroom home) and we are having issues with scheduling a delivery WITHIN their delivery area.  They changed the delivery to a pick up in Ontario without asking us.

Do yourself a favor and use a different storage company.

Also, you will get a new "team member" every time you talk to anyone so no one takes any ownership in helping you.  You will be on hold for 30 minutes waiting to speak with someone new in the Philippines every time you need help.<//text>< response>

Warning don’t use them!! We were moving into a new place and needed to store some new furniture. The furniture was picked up by Make Space in perfect condition - they were brand new in the bubble wrap from the manufacturer.

Fast forward a few weeks when they delivered the furniture. The bubble wrap was all ripped and falling off. The wood nightstands were all chipped and damaged.

The drivers were really nice and acknowledged that they items were clearly mistreated in the process. They told me to file a claim.

I filled the claim and they wanted to pay me $60. They originally cost $2,000. They then said they would pay $250 and I would have to sign a NDA because they didn’t want the negative attention.

$250 for damaging $2000 is not worth this happening to others. Do not use Make Space for storing nice items. I found some similar reviews online.</text>

<text>Moving can be incredibly stressful and I cannot express how amazing this experience was. You simply pack up all of your belongings into their free bags and MakeSpace will move and organize everything for you. Jose, Raul and Damian were my movers and they were amazing! They were professional, helpful, meticulous, and the nicest people ever. If you have the pleasure of meeting these three, you'll be incredibly impressed by their work. I highly recommend using this service, I couldn't be more happy with what I experienced.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80c2cee7cc8d0aed:0x7458b1f136d0f644< /gmap_id></record>

I booked them to move and store my furniture yesterday (Friday).

On the phone, they were very nice and accommodating.
Per their instructions, online, I completed the inventory list of what I was planning on moving and storing.  My list was very accurate, detailed and complete.

When the truck arrived, I felt it was too small but they assured me, based upon my inventory list, it would fit.  Well, it did not, not even close.

When the gentleman who were actually moving me that day realized that their truck was too small, they agreed with me and said that MakeSpace had "mismanaged" the move.  I agreed of course...but mistakes do happen and I understand that....but I thought they would simply charge me a little more or just come back with another truck once they dropped off half my furniture....that's right....their truck they brought could only fit about HALF of my total furniture that I needed moved.  Not even close to what I put on the inventory list.

So of course I asked them to please get me another truck to take the additional 50% and they could not do it.

As I'm sitting here typing this, I'm very frustrated because all my beds are still here in the rooms.  To leave 5 beds behind!?  What is that?  It's not like they couldn't fit in a last minute chair...or one more table...............about FIFTY PERCENT of my overall furniture was left behind!

You may be thinking 'Ok not a big deal'...but it is....it's a massive problem because I have a family that was supposed to be moving in the next day (TODAY)....and all my stuff had to be out by then.  You would think that they would simply charge a little more to get the rest...but at the very least they'd definitely get everything out by the end of the MOVE OUT DATE.  But nope.

So I call them all Friday evening and nobody would respond to my desperate pleads for help...and then.... they closed for the evening.  I could not reach anybody with this very serious problem.

The next day, when I finally got someone on the phone, (Bryan in Atlanta) I was told that, even though they screwed up, they can no longer help me with another truck to take the furniture that they couldn't fit into their first truck.
That, I would need to wait for an extra couple weeks for the next truck to become available.  I COULD NOT BELIEVE MY EARS.

As we all know, when you book a moving day...that's the day you have to move...it's that simple.  Especially when a new family is moving in to your home, the very next day.

And so it seems like they're telling me it's just sort of "tough luck".....and the family that was scheduled to move in to my home, now can no longer move in because my furniture is still sitting in my house.

I was (and am) so upset that now I am asking them to bring my stuff back to me...I no longer want them to store my things if they are going to do this to me......but they can't even get me my stuff back for an entire week they said.

I said, that's not acceptable because I booked this as the moving date and the other family, that's moving in to my home, booked it as their moving day as well.

IT WAS A DISASTER AND THEY REFUSED TO HELP....AND...to make it worse they were rude and unsympathetic (mainly Lucy - who refused to give me her last name).  She told me coldly and rudely that I underestimated the move...THAT IS NOT TRUE.  IT IS ALL ON THE INVENTORY LIST.  THERE WERE NO SURPRISES AND NOTHING WAS ADDED, NOT EVEN AN EXTRA SPOON.

Even if that were some extra things (which there was NOT), wouldn't you think a company would simply just charge me more....not tell me that they can't come get the rest for TWO WEEKS?

I genuinely never write bad reviews but I had to do this because I want to warn people.  How can a moving company pick up literally half of your stuff...take it off to storage and tell you to wait 2 weeks until they can return it...excuse me....I have to be out of my house TOMORROW and a new family is moving in.

DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY YOU WILL REGRET IT!<//review>< user_id>

Decided somewhat last minute not to renew my lease, called up make space and they got me their packing totes in just a couple days. On moving day Gabriel and Dara came through and did a great job clearing the apartment out. It was so much more convenient than getting a self storage unit and making a dozen trips to it.< /review>

Jonathan the Representative in Customer Service along with The two delivery Drivers, Fred and Raul were so amazing and helpful.  All three did all of the extra duties to assure that my experience was noteworthy.  Nothing about My MakeSpace has stayed true to the original sale when I joined this organization for my storage needs .... but these three were the best !   1 star for MakeSpace policy and contact and 5 STARS FOR THE BOYS.<//Text>

DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY. I was moving but needed to put my bedroom furniture in storage for a few months. When they picked up my bed frame they disassembled it, and when they returned it they did not include any of the bolts, screws, or latches they took off! Now I have no usable bed frame, and despite the fact that I took out the most expensive insurance available, no timeline on when I will be refunded. The customer service line is just nearly endless hold music and a series unhelpful people. No bed, no refund, no help. I repeat DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY.< /text>

Hey make space is amazing the two guys helping me  move Raul and Jose where the dopest and the most efficient movers I’ve ever seen in my life. They were prompt and quick. Measured & loaded everything to perfection.  Honestly, I don’t know if they could’ve done anything better. MakeSpace has made moving fun and not a hassle. Raul and Jose are each super awesome assets to the company,  and any future moving, I will definitely be contacting MakeSpace! Thank you all so much!!!!</Text>

<review>Hiring them was a mistake. They omit important pieces of information regarding delivery when you are scheduling a pickup. First, they don't resemble the furniture at the time of delivery. Second, they only deliver to a limited area. Orange County is not in their service area. Please be warned!

It is their duty to inform us about the limitations in their service, but at the end they are so unaccommodating that they expect us to bear all the burden of this miscommunication all by ourselves. I was on the phone with Milton several times and the only piece of information he told me, repeatedly,  was that the minimum requirement is three months. He only told about the information that was concerning their own benefit while they left out all the important information that effected me, their customer.

They expect you to go dig in their website in a few different places to find their limited services, even though their "business model" is built on the concept of convince. At least that is the way the advertise it.</review>< Resp>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Pictures>None< /Pictures><text>Whatever you do, do not store your belongings with MakeSpace. Don't be fooled - the pick up went well and they were on time and wrapped all my belongings. I was very excited to have found such a great company that made moving so easy, but I thought too soon. The first item I had dropped off was my couch and it was missing the legs and had a tear in it. It was an 8 month old couch that was over $1000. I was nervous about my other belongings after this first drop off. The next time they came they delivered the rest of my things. I watched them carelessly stack the boxes and then have them all fall over. They shattered my glass floor lamp. After setting up my new apartment I realized they also must have dropped my marble side table. It has a whole chunk out of the side. All around a VERY disappointing experience and I would not recommend this service to anyone. It sounds great, but it is all too good to be true which I learned the hard way.

Also, they breeze over protection plans. The only option available when you sign up is the "Basic" one and you are unable to change it before signing up and putting in your credit card. Apparently they asked me if I wanted to change in a phone call, but definitely felt like they were making it difficult to sign up for the more protective plans. I will probably get only $100 for my couch and much less for my lamp and table after the 6 week claim process...

PLEASE NOTE THAT THE LARGE MAJORITY OF THE GOOD REVIEWS ARE FROM PEOPLE WHO HAVE ONLY EXPERIENCED PICK UP AND NOT DROP OFF!!!<//text>< time>

A manager counted for me the amount of necessary storage capacity and payments.

Movers took care of my stuff, packed it and delivered and unloaded to the facility, so I am not worried about it.

Nice people as well, willing to do their best to help you. Thanks to Richard and Eddie for a great job!</Text></record>

I didn't end up needing their services because I decided to sell my furniture instead of keeping it in storage, but they were so incredibly helpful over the phone that I had to write a review! The level of professionalism and kindness over the phone was remarkable. Will definitely consider Makespace for any future storage needs.</review>

I had the best move out experience even in the middle of a pandemic, all thanks to the amazing MakeSpace team of movers: Raul, Tiffany, and Henry!!! The team texted ahead of time and arrived at the top end of the moving slot I had selected online. They packed and stored my items quickly and securely. After the move out, I immediately saw images of my items stored in the MakeSpace app.

The entire process was seamless. I highly recommend MakeSpace for your moving needs. And HUGE thank you to Raul, Tiffany, and Henry who worked hard on a hot day and truly went above and beyond!!</Text>

Due to Covid 19 I'm working virtually and decided to put my stuff in storage for while. I had to return to LA on my own to move out of my apartment at the end of my lease. I was stressed about how to make this work on my own and came across the MakeSpace website. I called them and within the space of about 2 minutes had every ounce of stress vanish. I asked what the catch was because it sounded too good to be true - and the only "ask" is that you sign up for 3 months. Good to go!
I called to ask a couple of questions before my pick up date - Jared called me back to check on me and I spoke with another staff member who was also super helpful!
Pick up day was a dream - Raul and Michael showed up early in the pick up slot (they sent a message about 40-50 minutes ahead of time to notify me) and got straight to work. They were super helpful, friendly and were excellent with communicating. The move took about 3-4 hours (I have a lot of stuff) and they wrapped all my furniture carefully. I couldn't have been happier with how the appointment went and am still so grateful to everyone who helped me get situated with this move during a stressful time. After the appointment I had a follow up email to verify that 2 shelf units were mine as the system had skipped on the day (there was a conversation on the day about the lag). They are now updating the system. Thank you to all!< /text>

GREAT SERVICE!!! My customer service rep was kind, and walked me through the process. Answered all of my many questions, and assured me. My movers were Richard T., Fernando, and Jose. They came in and got the job done! They wrapped up all my furniture, and handled all my fragile stuff with care. I trusted them and their work. This was a seamless process, and I would recommend them often.<//Review>

I moved at the end of summer and used MakeSpace. The movers who came were great - Oscar, Henry, and Christian. They were nice, very relaxed, and I didn't feel rushed while they were there. They were helpful and accommodating. I didn't give this company 5 stars because communication with customer support was a bit frustrating at times. I understand the pandemic is going on, but there were multiple times where I was ghosted and left in the dark regarding questions I had.< /text>

Art and Oscar were so very helpful when I came to collect all of things. They totally helped loaded up the cargo van.

It was quick and easy!

Thanks, guys!

After researching several several services, I decided to go with MakeSpace. Glad I did! Excellent communication the whole time with texts and emails, and even a very nice confirmation call. But, what I was most impressed by was the level of professionalism from standouts Fernando, Richard T, Andy, and Michael. They made things smooth and easy. "No problem" is there motto, which is important given the stress of moving, etc. They had no problem finding my place, parking, using the elevator, packing, etc. At the end of the day, what makes a great company is great people. Thank you!<//review>

I’ve used them twice now - once to store most of my household for a year in between homes, and most recently to store my office furniture while I work from home for awhile.  Always a fantastic experience - workers all courteous and respectful and very hard working and good at what they do.  And they delivered my household efficiently as well (office still pending).  The prices are reasonable if you add in the pickup and delivery services. And it’s great seeing pictures of everything being stored.  I have consistently had great interactions with this company and heartily recommend them.<//text>

My movers were phenomenal. They made everything seem like a breeze. They were also very quick and efficient. They were sure to ask me about every item before putting it in storage and even saved me from accidentally putting a very old, beautiful, and delicate parchment painting. They saw it in the pile and pointed out to me that it isn’t something they would recommend keeping in storage, since it’s so delicate and no frame yet. That was the cherry on top! Very considerate and conversational (for me at least). Quality movers with a strong and positive work ethic! I wish I remembered their names so that their supervisors can know these two do a great job together.</review>

I recently had a move out experience in Los Angeles- Nick and Allan were my movers and they made it super painless and easy! Major props to these guys for working so hard during the pandemic as well as in this heat. They are fantastic listeners and after just going through the items that needed to be stored with them 1 time - they accurately wrapped all my furniture items efficiently (total move out time was 2 hrs for a small 1 bdrm). The team seem like they’re really looking out for you. I would definitely work with them again.  Thanks guys!</Text>

<Review>Best decision I ever made! Moving is not only exhausting but daunting yet with MakeSpace; the whole thing was made so easy!  Oscar and Christian came right on time, and they were wow, hardworking, super kind, organized, and I was impressed with the careful packing of my delicate and valuable stuff.  They knew how to put apart my large sofa, and I was impressed with their organized scanning system. They're not your regular muscle movers. Oscar and Christian are strong, yes, but more importantly, honest, knowledgable, energetic, kind, and helpful. They made the whole experience feel like a breeze! I will definitely be using this service again!</Review>< pics>

That being said, my movers were excellent. They worked so hard to wrap things up carefully and quickly. Raul, Eduardo R., and Tiffany get 5 stars in my book.</review><response>None< /response><Date>1601250406331< /Date><user>102460492708249410450< /user>< Gmap_id>

Within an hour, MakeSpace had a replacement team ready and came during the original scheduled time. Antwone, Tiffany, and Isaiah crushed it. They were very friendly and quick and responsible with all of the items.  Made it look easy and went above and beyond to help us out in clearing out our space.

<review>Just moved out of LA with Makespace. Moving supplies were provided well ahead of time, making it easy to get stuff ready. On the day of, the movers (Oscar and Adrian, thanks!) wrapped and loaded everything in just over an hour.

The only complaint would be that they could make more FAQ's available on the website (e.g. what needs to be disassembled)<//review>< rate>

When I intially signed up with MakeSpace storage I thought the service was great however, I now have to relocate for work and I will only be able to retrieve my items the 8-10th.

After months of being an amazing customer, making  on-time payments and referring people the company is not willing to accommodate me and bring me my items when I need them. They told me I should’ve booked two weeks In advance but when I signed
up they told me my items would be delivered at my convenience. They lied. I’ve expressed to them that I’m on very tight schedule and they keep offering me dates that are just not an option. I’ve even narrowed down the items to necessities only and will come back and retrieve the other items at a later date, still no accommodation has been made.

I’m extremely disappointed with how they are handling this matter and won’t be referring them to anyone again.< /review>

This is my first time using a storage service and I was nervous about my items.
But Fredrick and Richard were really careful with boxes, helped me to properly pack the mirror and all of it took about 30 minutes. They were also very polite and friendly.

<gmap_id>0x80c2cee7cc8d0aed:0x7458b1f136d0f644<//gmap_id><Review>I would not recommend them to anyone- not because the concept isn’t appealing, but because their execution is really bad and unprofessional. With the hassle I had to go through, the almost 6 hour long move for a standard 1 bedroom (during which both me and my friend caught them watching YouTube videos on their phones), the misinformations, lack of ability and refusal to handle certain things- which they don’t tell you about over the phone or in fine print (they don’t store floor lamps, don’t help you take down tv mounts- even after moving the tv (and I had already packed my tool box), they don’t do this and that), (also FYI they do not store pianos, lotions, creams, toiletries of any kind, no liquids or food items of any kind, and a host of other things you may or may not know about ahead of time) , the overall sloppiness of it all (packing a computer monitor but forgetting about everything else including outlet, the mouse, the keyboard), the poor customer service (someone named Daniella kept cutting me off both times I called to book and then again to ask a question and voiced my concerns- about the bad reviews of movers not showing up nonetheless- and it turns out she gave me a totally wrong answer anyway) - the point is, you are much better off going with actual professional movers and just renting a storage place!!! The whole process was such a headache. The movers showed up looking stoned (whether they were or not I have no idea - but maybe that’s why they were so slow). The movers themselves said verbatim “customer service doesn’t know what they are talking about” .
In the end, I ended up getting charged even more monthly than if I went with a storage space!! How? I have no idea- considering my 1 bedroom is not that big, and I had already given away my bed, mattress, frame, coffee table, piano, and a bunch of other boxes with things they could not store- so it seems impossible for them to charge me for a 2 bedroom- maybe they packed everything in the storage like idiots or maybe they’re trying to scam.
The point is, you can’t go into their unit and look for yourself- so you are completely at their mercy. I have had pro movers before though, and they were 1000 times better and more efficient. My old movers before did everything including the drive and drop off in 3.5 hours.
With MakeSpace, I got a really sketchy vibe from the whole experience. Not only that- I didn’t find out that they decided to put my stuff in a larger storage charge me more until the next bill came! They didn’t even bother to send a message - email or text- about the change! I’d that’s not sketchy I don’t know what is.
Oh and FYI- if you have clothes in drawers, apparently you have to take them out and put them in a big ziplock bag or one of their Tupperwares- which would obviously mean that you have to pay for more storage  since everything would be taken out.
However, I was able to get around that because I had literally asked customer service this exact question and was assured me that I could put it in ziplocks and leave it in the drawers- so my friend and I literally spent hours vacuum sealing every item of clothing (per drawer) and stuffing it back in- only to have the movers tell us we had to take it all out! The only reason why they let me is because I spoke up about it- and expressed my frustrations with being told different things- and then they had to call corporate and ask. When you call, customer service makes it seem like everything g is so easy and hassle free and tells you wrong information to get you to go with them (I think they work on commission) - but then you find out it’s all different and there are a bunch of other rules during the move when it’s too late.
Anyway, point is, It was way more of a headache than just going the traditional route with professional movers and the ability to see how your stuff is stored. (And also to make sure no one steals anything- because with the experience I got- who knows)< /Review>< name>

Wow, where do I begin? Today on Thursday, June 25, 2020, I was supposed to welcome three Make Space movers into our home for a move. Several minutes beforehand, the Make Space team contacted us to say the move had been canceled because they were unable to find a truck. I paid hundreds of dollars to reserve a street permit spot in San Francisco for the truck. We need to be out of our apartment by the end of the month and now the other options for moving and storage are fully booked. I would not at recommend make space as a reliable solution for your move. We have used PODS before and we are kicking ourselves for not doing so this time around. We were so excited to try out a new up-and-coming company, but our first experience out of the gate has been disastrous. We are trying to contact the leaders and other others without success. I've received no response from the text feature. And make space has screwed up on several other requests, including a long delay in sending our green bin liners.<//Text>

They did not show up! They called at 7:59 am for an 8 - 11 am pick up slot and let me know they have to reschedule my appt to a week from that day. They said some of their crew was sick. They offered no alternative solutions to the fact that I had my whole house packed and ready to go. We had to find alternative movers and storage last minute, pay a premium for this. They let us keep the makespace bags because we had already packed in them. Completely unprofessional and they shouldn’t be able to get away with this!<//text>

Very convenient service.  Both surport people on the phone and the people who pick up and deliver also work great.  They are careful and detailed.  The only thing is that we need to mark things clearly so we know what we stored.  The provided bins are great also.<//review>

Moving day was my easiest one ever. Oscar and Eduardo were punctual and ready to move things quickly but extremely carefully. I felt very comfortable all the way through the process and happy that it’s more eco-friendly than the box/tape alternatives. I also love the price!

Eduardo R. and Henry at Makespace were fantastic! I thought about renting a Uhaul and moving everything out of my apartment myself and I am SO glad I chose to go with makespace instead. They wrapped the furniture carefully and were super efficient and polite. Such a great experience! Already recommending to all of my friends!< /text>

Then the day prior  to us needing to move of our apartment (Sunday), they phoned to tell me they would be, 'unable to provide service' on the scheduled date.  This basically meant they weren't coming to take my things and put them in storage.  I had reserved the day and time a month in advance and they phoned the day before!!  I was livid and told them they needed to figure out how to get staff to come and honor the date.  After much angst and finally speaking to a Supervisor, they did.  From the time I confirmed the reservation until pick up date, I had been diligent about updating my inventory online.  We sold many large items and the square footage from my original estimate to what was left dropped significantly.  With every conversation with Makespace, of which there were many, I reminded them that we wouldn't need the 10x15 unit I originally reserved, but would be able to use a 10x10.   The movers came and took our items.  One week later I received an email from Makespace saying that they had to put my items into a 10x20 space, which, surprise, surprise, would now cost significantly more than the 10x15 we reserved or the 10x10 that I knew we needed.  I've been trying to get someone on the phone ever since and, conveniently, I receive no reply.  I want to see a picture of my storage space with everything in it.  I don't believe for a minute that I need a 10x20.  Moving is stressful enough as it is, but having to deal with Makespace and their shenanigans is outrageous.  My items are now captive with them, but I will never, ever, EVER use them again.  And I will continue to complain to them until I hear back and resolve this and I will continue to tell everyone I know that they should never choose this service.< /Review></record>

The guys at makespace, Jesus, Luis and Juan, were awesome. They were there at 8am sharp ready to work and  hard work they did. I thought it would take until 4/5 pm but these guys cranked it out by 1pm. They were efficient and were very careful with all my stuff. They were friendly and minimally intrusive. I cant tell you how good they are. If you are moving look no further. I highly recommend makespace and the guys working there are amazing. Thanks Jesus, Luis and Juan once again<//Review>

what a beautiful concept that seems to be horrifically executed. if you have ANY issues with makespace, don’t expect customer service to get back to you for at least 5 days. i was excited by the idea of less waste and not spending money on packing supplies. i was supposed to have the “makespace” bags delivered on the 9th, which worked perfectly with my july 15th move. i took time off of work to start packing on the 9th-11th. when i checked shipping, the bags had not even been shipped by the 9th. panic set in, and i rushed to buy the moving supplies i thought would be unnecessary. after calling, emailing, texting, PRAYING, for some kind of communication, they finally got back to me after a WEEK. as i answered the phone with great relief and bit of frustration i exclaimed “i’ve been trying to call 5x a day!” and a very passive voice said “what’s the problem?” no apology, no explanation. i described my predicament. the excuse was that the holidays delayed shipping. somewhat understandable, but this should’ve been communicated. i explained that the NEW delivery date is the 16th. i wouldn’t even have keys to access my house on that day. on top of that, i tried to talk to this very passive and indifferent human about scheduling a delivery in august. he then tells me i would not receive my items for at least 3 MONTHS. this is NOT explained clearly when you sign up for this service. i had to cancel after sitting around for 2 weeks and dialing a number only to get sent to an automated robot. a total waste of time and horrendous customer service.  i don’t recommend as moving is already stressful and these folks were the cherry on top.< /text>

<review>This made my move so much easier, I can't imagine doing it any other way. The monthly rates were better than the self storage, and they came and picked everything up. Wrapped all the furniture up well, and treated everything as if it were their own.
Highly recommended. I just finished my appointment and have peace of mind. Everything is documented online with photos, it's all tracked, gotta love these nice little tech touches.

Antwone and Arturo are great, checked to see if they could come by for pickup earlier and that worked out even better. Super fast, careful, helpful and respectful. Really glad I found Makespace, makes everything so much easier.<//text>

I have never left a negative Google review before - but my experience with Makespace was so bad I thought people should be cautious. Their movers showed up an hour late to a 3 hour arrival window and from the start complained about the building layout. I was told that the beds bolts were stripped midway through the move and that it might damage the bed if taken out - to which I said that is fine and to proceed. Half of the two-person team went MIA halfway through the move so it was one person slowly loading already packed bags into boxes for the rest of the time.

After everything but the bed was out the team member came in to tell me that he couldn't take apart the bed. I took a closer look at the bed and asked to use his toolkit to try and he said he couldn't because it was company property and that they were past their time limit (after being an hour late) - that I would need to book another appointment as they closed up the truck. After they left I grabbed a screwdriver from a friend and was able to easily get the bolts out of the frame, but we now do not have a way to get it to storage and they are not answering our calls.

Use a different service if possible even if it is slightly more expensive - this is not worth it.< /text>

<Text>Great experience so far. Antwone and Yusuf delivered some of my storage items last Friday and it couldn't have gone smoother. They were in and out within 15 minutes, and were so nice & friendly. I was nervous about them accessing my gated complex and they knew exactly where to pull up, called me when they were outside the gate and unloaded my dresser and boxes so carefully and efficiently. Thank you!!</Text>< Pics>

I had MakeSpace pick up my stuff about a year ago.  I just had it delivered back to me today.  I was very happy with the service both ways.  It just so happened that one of the guys who delivered my stuff was one of guys who originally picked it up.

The idea of full service storage for such a reasonable price is awesome!

Those guys work HARD.  So tip them, and offer them water.<//review>

<Text>MakeSpace is a wonderful idea for storage solutions, especially now that they also use movers to pick up furniture items along with the green boxes of belongings. They are newer so they are still working out some logistic kinks and communication across different areas of the company and with third party contractors, but they will get there. There was some mix up in what a salesperson promised me they’d be able to pick up and what the actual movers were capable of on the day they came to pick it up, but make space managers helped address the issue and work quickly to help to fix it and follow through with what they promised. The BEST and most professional and strong movers who came out the SECOND time to pick up my large elliptical and knew what they were doing and were thorough and polite were Antwone, Nicolas, and Yusuf in Los Angeles area. I hope I get those guys next time too!< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>{'time': 1580491856982, 'text': "Hi Emily,\n\nThank you for taking the time to share your experience, and for your shout out to Antwone, Nicolas and Yusuf.

These guys have the best service and the best moving/storage plan around!   They show up when they say they will, they send packing materials in advance, they answer support emails/calls immediately and effectively.  And their prices are so fair!  Free moving, comparable storage prices, and one item delivered to you free per month.  This is an amazing business model and so well run.  I'm extremely pleased.</Review>

<Text>This is my third time using MakeSpace and I doubt I’d ever go bald to using a traditional storage company. The ease and convenience is great and so are the people.

Been using MakeSpace for a few years. They always come during their window and the pick ups / drop offs are very efficient. You can request foldable bags in advance of your move to fill up. When they arrive with empty crates, you drop the bags inside, scan into system, and then voila. You’re finished. Today’s crew (Lony and Juan) were in and out in under 15 minutes. Thanks MakeSpace!< /review>

We’ve been using MakeSpace for a few years now and they make everything beyond simple!  Their service is always top notch and every time we have a pick up or drop off they call and check to see if they can come earlier because they’re in the area, which is wonderful! Most services are late to their expected window of arrival.

Today I had the pleasure of having my Christmas decorations picked up by Yusuf and Antonio.  They called me to see if they could arrive earlier which was fine with me!  My baby had just gone down for a nap so I asked if they could come up to my apartment so I didn’t have to disturb her and they were more than happy to do so.  They were incredibly friendly and kind! This is why we continue to use MakeSpace!< /Text>

<review>In my life, I have moved more than 20 times and have worked with storage companies, both white glove and otherwise.  In all of those moves I’ve never found reason to complain.  Thursday November 14, the first day of the MakeSpace move, we had for all intents and purposes, only one mover as George was having shortness of breath and chest pain.  Antoine worked the day alone with no backup moving boxes of books and heavy storage up and down stairs.  Arden emailed your office immediately about our concern for George’s health and Jack responded right away that someone would call. No one ever called.

I spoke on the phone with Jared who offered to send movers the following day to complete the job at your expense. Today, Friday November 15th, three movers showed up. One of the movers was George, who told me he had “collapsed” the  evening before. The other movers said George was here “to do nothing.”  Yet George was up and down the stairs again carrying with great effort heavy boxes. I was worried for George’s wellbeing.

•Sending George two days in a row, knowing he has chest pains and shortness of breath, put me and my business at risk for liability.

•The pickup that should have taken one day stretched to another day because it was understaffed (only one healthy mover) and the pickup scheduled for the 2nd stop a block away was never made.

•The movers did not finish the job here on the second day.

•The movers took a break on the second day and never returned, KNOWINGLY leaving behind parts of a wooden bench they otherwise packed and took with them.

•They also did not carefully pack items that I had not previously packed (see photos attached).

•They left without making the pickup at the storage a block away that was not accomplished the day before, saying they were not authorized to do so. I spoke with Kevin in your office twice who told me that after he spoke with the managing operator in LA that we would have to schedule a THIRD pick up date for that.

•I have been forced to pay my assistant for her to drive an hour each way to work today to accommodate this extra, unexpected pick up day and to work all day simply for the pick  up.  This extra expense is because of the poor service I’ve received from MakeSpace.

•I have been unable to work for two days, also at cost to me.

•The pick up is still incomplete!

•To add to this insult, I just received a bill from MakeSpace of $285 for today’s pickup which had been promised by you at no charge.

•Lastly, many of the online photographs of each box in storage do not show the labels so I am not able to identify the contents.  Please ask the warehouse to rephotograph those boxes that do not show labels.< /review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOvhC5f-J5D_aOeUfO6zgo_zDi6o_719ZZKe90p=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><response>{'time': 1574292740903, 'text': "Hi Arden,\n\nI'm truly sorry to hear that your recent MakeSpace experience hasn't lived up to the high standards we're working hard to deliver.

I really like this system. I NEVER have to rent a moving truck or go to a storage space again.  I simply pre-pack what I want to send to storage in the green make space bags, and then the movers come during a scheduled window (always on time), put the bags in hard boxes, and take them away to storage. SInce they take pictures of everything I can order something back by clicking on it on the website and then the movers bring it back. Its so simple and easy, I think it is brilliant.  Yusuf and Richard came today to drop off and pick up more stuff- there were friendly and fast and efficient.  Thanks guys!<//Review>

Horrendous service, they will randomly say that you need a lot more space than you do, and then call you a liar if you disagree.

UPDATE: Upon talking to customer service further, they did change the price and as a result, I am increasing the rating from to a 4.< /review>

The first stage of storage went really well from start to finish. The team was professional in every way. They dropped off crates and wardrobe boxes ahead of moving day and they confirmed our appointment several times before the big day.

On moving day, a team of 3 professional men arrived promptly and were fully prepared with bubble wrap and packing supplies. They carefully wrapped and loaded up all items in a professional manner.

One man set his water bottle on a piece of valuable furniture and I noticed a scratch on a table that I hadn't seen before. I reported this to the company and they wanted to take care of it right away. As it turned out, the water bottle didn't do any damage at all and they noted the table scratch so they could take care of it, if necessary, upon delivery. I'm hoping it will buff out and not require a claim.

My artwork was individually packaged and I had enough to cause my storage need to go up slightly from the quote.  I was charged for the slightly larger space but then I got an email from the person I reported the scratch to and he said I went over so slightly that he was reducing the fee back to my original quote. (an $80 a month reduction) That impressed me a lot because they say they will only charge for the space you use and they stood behind that claim.

Based on my positive experience with the pickup and the courteous and attentive customer service, I assume the drop off will go well too. I will update this review with that experience when the time comes, in approximately 6 months.<//Review>

I cannot stress enough how concerned I am about our items stored with MakeSpace. I was under time constraint to get our things out of the house and into storage and didn’t look into the reviews of this company. Most of our things are either custom or antique. Lots of mirrors. The first shipment we received back was small and a completely shocking nightmare. It was as if our beautiful antique table we brought back from London was run over by a truck. The table was valued at $2,000 and they gave us $150. At least they were on time to pick up and deliver our destroyed furniture. WTF. Their complete lack of regard is Just so upsetting.< /Text>

Makespace is a great concept, with some truly great people, but ensure to keep an eye on how they pack your things. I had damage that though the staff said they would start the claims process on, they ignored and then told me it was too late to do anything about.<//Text>

Great service. I'm getting a little older now, and the prospect of a move for the first time in 20 years (!) was scary. But makespace made things a lot easier. They came to my door, packed everything quickly, and were off in exactly the time allotted. There were things to sign, but no bill. The storage cost was all you had to bother with, each month. Minimum, three moths. When you need it back, you call them up, and delivery is free. If you need the things in stages, small delivery charges apply. Well worth it.< /review>

MakeSpace has been nothing shy of amazing! Everyone I spoke to, worked with, or emailed was extremely accommodating and professional. They were very flexible with pick up and drop off times. I feel like my belongings are safe and well cared for, especially with the use and ease of their scanning/photo system.
So happy I found you MakeSpace!<//text>

<Text>If you live in LA, between traffic and increasing living costs finding an affordable and easy way to easily store and retrieve your stuff instead of trying to live with it or consider moving for a huge premium, is key. MakeSpace does just that. It literally makes space in your home and let's you retrieve items like chairs or seasonal clothing, from storage, for when the time demands it. And their app help remind you where things are. I highly recommend the service.<//Text><Time>1503946313564< /Time><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< gmapID>

< Review>
I am a combat disabled veteran of 20 years in the Marire Corps and this company lied to me and my wife by saying they will deliver anywhere. That's why I trusted them with my furniture and now that I moved outside the area they refused to help. There manager Kylie Bricks is very rude and unprofessional. She didn't even try to resolve this issue. I will report these people to the BBB today. Don't trust this company. I never post bad reviews ever but this is my 1st. How can you do a veteran like this. Terrible....</Review>

My experience with makespace was an excellent one. I have absolutely nothing bad to say about them, I like how they wrap the furniture provide the boxes for clothes,and shoes, and I appreciated  how they keep you posted of  there ETA. Also  how well the men work together, and last but not least they pick up your items and deliver them to you they take pictures of your items and you can view them online. I can go on and on about how convenient and non stressful this experience as been thank you so much.</Review>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None< /resp><Name>Gina Wong< /Name><text>I stumbled across this company while in search for storage. I had no idea what I was getting into packing up a 2 bedroom apartment. I was overwhelmed having to move after 10 years. Make Space contacted me quickly. Hannah wasssweet and walked me through the process. They delivered bins to my front door to pack my belongings, came on moving day with a team, who told me to sit while they wrapped my furniture. Idifnt lift a finger. I have since moved again where they delivered my furniture and set it up with a smile.

This company has had some good growing pains as they've expanded quickly. They've worked with me to keep me a happy customer and I've appreciated the follow up. Highly recommended.<//text></record>

<Date>1492118570545</Date><Rate>1<//Rate><review>Took 5 weeks to honor the request to re-shoot an item posted online that was not visible if it was mine or not. It took repeated calls and email correspondence for over a month for a simple request like this to be enacted. It's all good now but the service and internal communication during this process was utterly terrible.
It is also really bad that MakeSpace does not have a head office number to talk to that can oversee problems like this. There is no supervisor to take the lead and it is just left on the employees which I believe is unfair on them for the head office to put the burden on. You really need to review your internal management and have a person responsible.</review>< pics>

< Review>
Every contact with MakeSpace has been excellent. From the folks on the phone who helped us set things up to the guys/gals who come out to drop off & pick up the containers, we have found everyone to be friendly, service oriented  and always cheerful.

Plus the prices are so much more reasonable than other storage places and, unlike those places, the prices are locked in. So no more $10, $15, $20 or more surprise rental price increases for us.

We're more than customers, we're fans.<//Review>

Awful service, They are too expensive and would tell you that the boxes are free but then they’ll make you pay them.Another thing that really bothered me is that they don’t tell you the exact time they come and make you pay if you make them wait and they’re rude.<//review>

<text>This is the best way to do storage! I'm so glad I found this. MakeSpace makes everything so easy, they pack your furniture and you put things in their bins, and they pick it up! Then you can get any item delivered back to you any time.  Saves SO much lifting and driving.
All the services are the way it should be, an app to schedule, text messages when they are on their way, and a website showing photos of all your items.
Antwone and Angel picked up my items and were a great team, very helpful and friendly.<//text>< Pics>

I am happy to hear about your pleasant experience with our SpaceMakers.\n\nYour storage rates are determined by the cubic footage of the items picked up. Our Storage Experts strive to be as detailed as possible when quoting new customers, and we state that adding items to storage will lead to an increase in your monthly rate.\n\nI checked with our Customer Support team and it looks like  although you mentioned needing storage for approximately 35 items, we stored 91 items.

I’m very sorry that the price charged was unexpected due to the added items.\n\nIf there is anything we can do to further assist you, please feel free to contact us at 800-920-2372 or support@makespace.com.

They destroyed our coffee table, dining room table, bed frame and king size mattress. They damaged our couch legs and pc computer tower. They lost many other items. In all they refunded us $750, which is nowhere near the many thousands of dollars spent to replace the items, as well as fees paid to Makespace for their service. Protip: save time by just flushing stacks of hundreds down the toilet.

@makespace: the account was under my partner's name. I paid for the account on my credit card. Unfortunately, the opportunity to make this right has already passed.< /Text>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>I have been storing with MakeSpace for almost a year now and have had a great experience. The initial pickup was very smooth and easy. The crew was on time and very professional. I recently added more items and arranging the pickup was super easy and again the crew was on time and very professional - took only 10 mins total. I've had to deal with customer service team and they are also great - helped solve my problem right away. MakeSpace is such a great alternative to a physical storage unit. I never have to worry about driving to the storage space and having to deal with weirdos in there. They bring everything right to me! The pricing is also very competitive - not sure why you wouldn't choose MakeSpace.</Review>< pics>

Hornswoggle, Despicable, Rude and Hoax.

I used them to pick up my 1 bedroom apartment which took almost half of the delivery truck not double stacked, the estimation was about $160, they took $100 deposit to send movers to my place they arrived and since they came I am helping them moving the heavy items because apparently they were hassling and wasting my time, one hour lunch they took and after they came I am still helping, thousands of phone calls from dispatch asking them to hurry up signed the contract on a phone has a crack which I couldn't see the agreement on. Found the charges for the storage 10x10 for my furniture which didn't take half of their bobtail truck is $397 and they didn't refund the deposit or even deduct it from the rent so paid total of $497 for first month with a fake $75 discount from preferred customer who had the same situation also.

Time to deliver,
The answer was " we don't deliver to this area! But we can deliver your items somewhere else!"
Despite the fact that I just moved 4 miles away from where I used to live.

And what made it needle which brook the camel back. I had to pay for delivery and storage for the entire agreement.

DON'T USE MAKESPACE STORAGE, SEE HOW THEY PACK YOUR ITEMS AT THEIR WAREHOUSE, WONDERING HOW COME ITEMS GOT LOST, YOU ARE SHARING YOUR SPACE WITH OTHER PEOPLE AND PAY FOR WHAT THEY THINK FITS YOUR ITEMS. THEY GIVE YOU ESTIMATE DEPENDS ON THE AREA YOU ARE MOVING FROM.<//text>

I recently decided to get rid of my apartment in Los Angeles to travel the world for a year. As you can imagine, this required getting every aspect of my life in order, things you wouldn't even think about. My decision to use Make Space was one of the best I made. It was so easy to get the packing materials from them (and I didn't have to pay for packing materials) and pack up my stuff.  On moving day, they arrived, wrapped all my furniture and were gone within a couple of hours. It was SO easy!  I also compared prices with getting a storage unit.  My rough calculation is that I saved hundreds of dollars between packing supplies,  hiring movers and the likely mistake of selecting the wrong size storage space.<//Text>

I had a 4pm appointment but Helen didn’t get to me until 4:30pm. I asked for eyelashes. She quickly placed the lashes (less than 20minutes)  OMG!!! When I say NEVER again. She absolutely did NOT know what she was doing. I don’t know what kind of glue she used... but I promise, it should NOT be used on your eyes. And how she positioned the lashes under my own lash on the inside of my eyes!??!  About an hour after being done, my eyes hurt so bad (itchy and scratchy). I had to keep the lashes for the occasion but after the weekend, I immediately tried to remove them. ALL of my real lashes are painfully GONE. And when I tell you, it has been a week and I still have 4-5 fake lashes on ONE eye... they won’t come off!!! My eyelids are puffy and sore. Not to mention how ridiculous I look. Helen should NOT be providing this service at all. Not to mention the quality of the lashes... stiff like a broom. Just horrible!!! DO NOT GET EYELASHES HERE!!!</Text>

<text>I love Club Nail Spa! Wendy is the best by far! I have had my nails done for decades. And they would pop off, turn yellow or break. With Wendy her nails last into your own nail grows out they never lift, they never pop off and I never get a fungus. She goes the extra in cleanliness! Is the only reason why I KEEP GOING BACK!! GO SEE FOR YOURSELF!!! And ask for WENDY. My name is Kim and I recommend Club Nail Spa! You'll be glad you did! 😎😇🤗<//text><pics>None< /pics><rate>5< /rate><user_id>118184927055802620964</user_id></record></dataset><record>

I've been coming here off and on for six years. Staff is polite, courteous,  and friendly. Prices are reasonable.
Shop was renovated a few months ago with new stations and spa chairs. Walk-ins are accepted. Busy on weekends. Highly recommend.</Text>

Shop opens at 10. I waited until after 11 because no one was there and when I asked what time would someone get there, I was asked for what?? My response was to do some work. Eventually came in and with attitude. Cut my finger while filing with the drill and I had to wipe blood away a few times. Horrible experience! NEVER AGAIN!!<//review>

<Review>I was gonna get my nails done so one of the ladies asked what I wanted. I showed her a picture and she said. "Okay I can do that except the lines." I said cool no problem. So she started doing her thing. Then she took out the nail drill. She started with my pinky. She gave me a cut so I said ow the cut me. She just looked at me and went to the next nail. That one was fine until she went to the middle finger. She cut me twice. This was my frost time so I wasn't sure If this was normal? So I looked at her like don't you see blood coming out? So I kept saying ow. She did this 2 more times!! Thank god she finished so she started painting my nails.  I showed her the picture again and she told me she couldn't do that design. So I said wait a minute, didn't you say you can do that when we first started? And she stood quiet then she said do you have another choice? So I did. Just put me the word "u.s. Air Force" she tried it on my thumb, and did a messy job! -.- so I just told her paint my nails blue and my thumbs white please I'm done. And not to mention the fact that she was talking across the room with her language. So she never asked me anything or talked to me. Yet, I saw employers there talk to their clients. So I give it a 2 stars because she did paint my nails great! But just the process of getting my nails was horrible! And I totally forgot to ask for her name. -.-<//Review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

The technicians are good...  But... One word..     "87°f"...  And I'm not talking about the temperature of the foot soak..    The room was so hot, that I was literally sweating. They thought opening the back door and getting cross ventilation in would help...  NOT... it was just hot summer desert air.  The girl at the shop didn't get the hint I mentioned how hot it was.

After melting for several minutes, I finally broke down and asked the same girl (manager) if she could turn the air on. She looked at me, rolled her eyes in disgust and walked away to turn it on with out acknowledging me.

People skills are everything</review>

<Review>Helen did a mani pedi. The foot bath was not clean before she quickly placed a plastic cover inside and the file tools she used on my feet were used on someone already...she tried to defend her mistake once I mentioned the used files. A small red sore developed on the top of my foot the next day. Never Again!< /Review>< Pics>

<Review>I will NEVER get my nails done here again. I came here with my 3 little girls and spent over $100 and they couldn't even do my nails right. The lady drilled my acrylic nails sooooo thin that they started breaking the same day. I went back and explained that all of my nails are going to break because they're too thin, and he only fixed the broken one. He told me the rest would be okay, but I knew better, and then the next day more nails broke.<//Review>< user>

To me nails should last almost 3 weeks , but it’s like they have it to when the nails knows when to get up . Also for $25 dollars the nails are kinda short.<//text>< pictures>

<text>Terrible experience! Took my fiance there and she asked for coffin cut nails and they gave her these out dated fat ugly nails. When the lady cut them she literally asked them to cut them slimmer but she refused and said she would file them down but didn't.  Rude as hell. Won't be going back! Only go here if you want fat ugly old lady style nails.<//text>< UserId.>

ANYWAYS , AFTER PICKING A GEL COLOR , I REALIZE THEY ARE SO CHEAP  THAT THEY  WATER DOWN AND MIX EVERY POLISH. WHAT I PICKED WAS NOT WHAT SHE STARTED USING ON ME , AFTER HAVING THE SAME GLITTER USED I KNOW IT WAS MIXED WITH SEVERAL COLORS . SHE DIFMT CARE SHE KNEW IT WAS MIXED 100 DIFF WAYS SHE STARTED PAINTING MY NAILS ANYWAYS.  FIRST NAIL SHE APPLIED IT TO I POINT OUT IT NOT THE SHADE. SHE MAKES EXCUSES  ABOUT HOW THE SHADE 411 SHOOTING STAR , HAS CHANGED FROM SILVER IRIDESCENT TO PURPLE GLITTER.  SO INSTEAD OF LETTING ME KNOW SHE GOES TO TOWN DOING WHATEVER SHE WANTS. SHE TRIED TO FIND  MORE WATERED DOWN SHADES TO PUT ON TOP. I DECLINED AND SHE BEGAN TO YELL AT ME IN WHATEVER LANGUAGE SHE SPEAKS. I PAID FOR MY PEDI AND LEFT WITH HALF DONE GELS TO SHOW THE OWNER . THESE TECH ARE LAZY AND UNPROFESSIONAL. CANT KEEP A CLEAN SALIN OR DO A DECENT GEL MANI. NEVER AGAIN<//text></record>

I have utilized their services 2 times already and all I have to say is that this is a great establishment for buying, selling or repairing your cellphone device. The staff is very friendly and helpful with any questions you may have. Not only you may find cellphones,  they also have a wide variety of tablets, smartwatches and other electronic devices. You can bring your device for repair or trade it in for another one offsetting the value of your device. The used cellphones quality is optimal. I cannot tell they are used phones and are in prime quality. You can also sell your device as well. One interesting thing I saw is that they have very rare and old cellphone devices. So if you are looking into any brand they most likely have it or they will call you when they find it! I recommend Invisible Armor to anyone looking to buy, sell or repair their cellphone, tablet!!!</Review></record>

It is the best place to change iPhone screen! I thought my iPhone would not be fixed since it broke so badly, but It just takes us 25mins to fix it, very professional!< /Review>

<review>The staff here is amazing. I went to the Main Place location over a year ago when my old iPhone was having charging issues. Not only did they set me up with a new  (well, used) iPhone, but they also transferred all the data from my old iPhone. It was a challenge since the cable port was broken, but they were dedicated and got the job done! I’ll be coming back here soon to upgrade. Can’t wait.<//review>< Pictures>

Needed my Samsung s10 Google unlocked and carrier unlocked. They did both in under one day and at a very fair price. They even told me to try it out before I left. Would definitely come back and would recommended them. Great guys and great business</text>

I come to invisible armor for all my repairs and always have top notch results in a short period of time. Alfonso and Janet are so down to earth and always attend me with professionalism,  that’s why i never bother to pay or drive up to the OC from Downey anytime i need a repair. Extremely recommended!<//review>

My Note 10+ charging port got wet and stopped taking a charge. After going to Best Buy and hearing one of the workers recommend this place, I decided to go and check it out. They were timely and they own up to their warranty (through no fault of their own, the brand new part that they had installed at first and that I paid for had issues, they replaced it without any extra charges and also reimbursed me for another extra speaker I had bought because at first we all thought that was the real issue). Alfonso, Daniel and Jorge were all truly nice and courteous with me. Service was quick, efficient and honestly one of my to-go places to either get your phone fixed or buy a used phone for a reasonable price.</text>

Esteban did a great job replacing the battery of my good old Galaxy Note 5 for a reasonable price. I tried to do it myself at first but I failed miserably because it's not as easy as it looks. Thanks to the expertise of Invisible Armor Repair, I had my phone ready in a couple of hours as promised after I brought my phone and my own new battery. My smartphone has a new life now! I definitely recommend their service.< /Review>

<UserId.>105197510602955466056<//UserId.><Review>I took my phone for a screen replacement and the mic wouldn’t work properly afterward. I didn’t relate this mic issue to the screen replacement at first, but after doing some research I found out it happens frequently, so I went back to the shop. I was received with a lot of attitude, the white guy behind the counter wouldn’t believe me and immediately began opening Apps and messing with the phone without even telling me he needed to do that. They opened the phone back up, made me reinstall apps and do a soft reset, all without any success. Not only they couldn’t solve the issue, but after my second visit to this shop, I’m running into more issues with the camera and the phone. If you ask me, these guys don’t know what they are doing. I would avoid this business!</Review>< Pics>

I was recommended by a friend to stop by this place for iPhone 12 cases.  Me and my wife are really happy with the cases we purchased. Not only did they have a lot of accessories but they also have a cool collection of phones. When I say collection they I mean old school phones like blackberry, Nokia, and the Motorola Brick phone.</text>

After looking through so many other companies I chose them based on their positive reviews. I would like to share my experience. The process couldn't have been simpler. I called to let them know I was coming and the lady told me that once the part was delivered it would take less than 30 minutes to complete it. Well she did it in 20 minutes & the huge plus was that it was inexpensive too.

<text>Dropped my iPhone 11 in the carpet not only the screen broke but couldn’t use the phone. Touch was not working and their where lines going down the middle.  Made an appointment with Best Buy once I get their they said they will need it for 24 hours. I could do it because I needed the phone for work. I called this place and they said they could get it done within 30 min.  Not only they got it done in less than 20 min it was cheaper than Best Buy.<//text><Name>Candace Delatorre<//Name>< UserId.>

My phone stop charging couple days ago took it a different shop and they couldn’t fix it. They had it for a whole day and they couldn’t fix it. Took it to this shop they did a quick diagnose and said the charger ic is bad. Some chip inside the phone.  They told me they could have it ready around 6:30. They ended up fixing phone I have a iPhone 7 Plus I know is older model but beats paying $800 for a newer model.</review>

These guys are worth the extra trip I had to made. I needed to unlock my Sprint Samsung note 8 for European carrier. What we all know Sprint is pain to unlock. Any other place gave me headache or unreasonably high price. These guys were fast to respond and had great price for the service provided for me. I went there Saturday and they needed phone for 24 hours, what was fine w me cuz I needed it by Sunday night. Even tho they called Sunday they needed more time and phone will be unlocked by Monday, what just wasnt possible for me, they made it happened! Im so very grateful to them.< /review>

This place is great. I highly recommend it. Because it inside of the mall they’re open a little bit later than other places that’s a plus. Really helpful they know what they’re doing.</Review>

I had good service. My cellphone battery is not holding a charge. They don't have my battery for a Nexus 5X but they are ordering it for me. I'll let you know how it goes. They are very nice and helpful.< /Review>

I came in with a damaged phone that a other company had fixed and it broke on me again i came to this place and Daniel repaired my phone so quickly and at a really good price the other retailer charged me a lot he charged me only half that price. Super amazing i Can finally see my phone clearly now. Amazing work will recommend this company in the future. Thanks a bunch ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️< /Text>

The guy, Rick, he was very helpful! Super knowledgeable and he was very honest with his advice. He didn't want to charge me for a repair on my broken Samsung S6 Edge. Said it was going to cost more than just getting a used one. Saved me at least $150! They even had used phones for sale right there! Friend referred me to them because they've had really great repairs done here but I can't comment on that myself since I didn't get one< /text>

I have an older Samsung Galaxy phone and this place had what I was looking for. If your mobile phone is new or old & needs fixed, give this place a try.

Broke my iPhone 7 screen and didn't think it was possible to fix. These guys do excellent work and at a fair price.  Also they keep the part in stock and I was in and out in less than 30 min. Very professional staff and super friendly. Hope I never break my phone again but if I do I'll definitely come back here.< /Text>

Recently got my note 5 repaired after my son decided to throw it, called around to a lot of shops and couldn't find anyone who repaired them. Luckily I found them in the mall while I was black Friday shopping and Daniel let me know he would be able to finish it while I kept shopping.
He was very helpful even gave me 30% off for a case
That's located in their new store in orange.
Highly recommend these guys for repairs</Text>

<Review>I stopped to buy a screen protector, and Brenda was very helpful. She answered all my questions and was very attentive. She did an amazing job putting the screen protector, no air bubbles, which not alot of people take the time to do it perfect.

Fantastic customer service. Ask for Brenda.<//Review>< pictures>

Great place with friendly staff. Have been coming to invisible armor for 2 years now and anytime I need my note 5 tempered glass replaced, I just come back to these guys and for $10 I get a brand new one. Saves me time and money. Wouldn't think about going anywhere else. Ask for PK he always does a great job.<//review>

So anyone looking for a great screen protector come here. And get your phone a screen cover that will do the work to insure your phone's protected.

Great company with real good people. I found them on Craigslist and had them unlock my Samsung s8 . Super happy with their response times and their service.  Wasn't in there for more than 10 min they answered all my questions and I felt safe leaving my phone since it would take 24 hrs to be unlocked

The employee that helped me out the day was so helpful, make sure his name is Jesus he's really great!< /review>

Had an iPhone 6 repaired here! My phone was shattered and they did an awesome job repairing my phone and making it look like new! No bad effects resulted after the repair. Strongly recommend Invisible Armor for anyone looking for a phone repair. The repair service is quick and the price is very reasonable! On top of that you get a one year warranty!< /Review>

Amazing place! Fantastic employees who are very knowledgeable. Replaced my screen for $50 less than Apple in 20 minutes. Apple made me wait over a week, took my phone for 2 hours, then said they wouldn't fix it. More people need to know about this business.< /Text>

<text>Invisible Armor is the best for screen and mobile repair. I was referred to them by a friend who had nothing but good things to say and I wasn’t disappointed! When I broke my screen I was stressed out that I wouldn’t have my phone for longer than 30 minutes. Well, they got it done in 15-20! It was so fast and looks brand new. I would definitely recommend to get your mobile phone repaired here. Thanks again!< /text><user_name>Taylor Smith<//user_name><Time>1516223830401<//Time>< response>

I wanted to sell my old cell phones
Saw that this place had great reviews. Get there was the first one in line then somebody else get there and the guy says I'm gonna help this customers first, then I was like I'm a customer also and he said that I wasn't one because I'm selling stuff to him. Though that was rude so i took my business elsewhere. Didn't get his name but obviously he shouldn't be doing customer service if he's not gonna help the first customer there.< /review>

Tagged along with my sister who broke her iPhone 7 and ended up buying a screen protector. They gave us 30% off protection with her repair . I got the tempered glass and it looks so good better than the plastic one I had before. Guys were really nice and helpful. Ask for pk.< /Review>

This place is incredible! I have busted my screen more than three times and thanks to the Temper Glass screen protector, it saved my screen. I am so greatful for this product. Every time I return, it only cost less than $10.00 to replace. It doesn't get better than that. I'm a customer for life... Very satisfied customer... Thank you!</review>

<review>“Fixed” my cracked screen for $50 dollars just for my phone to be gittery& unresponsive the next day.Received minimal help, no refund and was almost convinced it was not their fault. Ha my phone had been great before coming here. Lost money & time. Don’t try to make a profit of of someone who’s sincerely asking for your f***** help, 150 to fix your mistake. Basically what the phones worth today. Take your business up the street</review><userid>108265004477732168205</userid><GmapID>0x80dcd9cf20da30b5:0x99ca90491b140b0b<//GmapID>< Pics>

They just put on a screen cover for my iPad Pro.  They did a great job!  This is my second time coming to them as they also put a cover on my iPhone 6 Plus a couple of months ago.  Very helpful and most importantly careful with my toys.  Highly recommend.<//Review>

I loved their prices and Alfonso really helped me out with his knowledge and experience. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking to get their broken screen fixed. It's about 30 dollars cheaper than other repair places. I even had my phone ready same day.</Text>

Got my iPhone 6 screen repaired and battery replaced I was thinking of getting a new phone but the price was too good to let go and decided to get it fixed instead the process was super quick only took 15 minutes and my phone looks brand new out of the box. I'm super satisfied with the work and service and will definitely come back and do all my devices with invisible armor thanks Jesus for helping me out!<//Review>

I just received a new case from Invisible Armor, Daniel was very helpful when picking out the case. Although, I was not able to purchase a screen protector I definitely will be back once I have the funds!!! I highly recommend this company, they have a great return and rewards program as well!< /review>

<Text>I was impressed by the way Jesus took care of us. My phone was a mess! it was cracked from bottom to top and I was about to give up and get brand new iPhone. A couple friends mentioned to come by and talk to Jesus and see if he had a solution for it and surprisingly he was able to fix it. I'll highly recommend him and his crew< /Text>< pictures>

<Review>This is always the store we go to whenever we get our phones done ( screen protectors). They really do a great great job!! the shields last you for a long time and its worth it. The staff are friendly and nice too. Ricardo, The guy who did our iphones 7 & 7 plus really did a good job and he's friendly and very accomodating. And we thank him for the discounts they gave us because we've been their loyal customers for a long long time.. Keep it up guys!!!🙌🏼<//Review><Time>1479530348297<//Time><GmapID>0x80dcd9cf20da30b5:0x99ca90491b140b0b</GmapID>< name>

Called this place recently to find out the price to repair “2” IPhone 7+ screens and buy a new battery for an iPhone 7+

Was quoted $120 each phone to fix the screen

$70 for a battery

$310 total

I asked “Why so much for the battery when they sell for $10 on Amazon?”

He replied “Because we have to open the phone.”

I replied “Don’t you open the phone to fix the screen?”

He replied “oh...ya...ok....well only $50 then”

I replied “ok $50, even though they’re only $10 on Amazon?
How much if I bring the battery to you?”

His reply “$30”

So while this store wanted $310 for the whole thing I found a competitor with fair prices and they did it at

$70 for each Iphone 7+ screen repair
$35 for iPhone 7+ battery

$175 total

That’s $135 cheaper for the same service. Do yourself a favor and take 5 min to compare prices with their competitors, it’s worth the 5 min, it saved me $135!!< /Text>

<review>Had no idea if my phone would ever work again the LCD went out and they fixed it so fast! Less than 30 min. Complete professionals and very well trained in dealing with customers while I was there some guy lost his temper and the employees stayed so calm and collected . Shows a lot about this company.

The manager Alfonso was very nice and let me know other problem that my iPhone has in the power button and give a budget for the repairs.
The parts replaced are very good and I recommend visit to get cases and accessories, they have a good stock for several brands and models.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

Had my screen protector replaced for my iPhone 6s Plus, fast and easy service. I recommend coming here if your phone needs that extra protection.<//Text>

the service here was great, I came in with two phone. Same type, one with a crack screen and the other with its iOS bricked. The guy took out the motherboard out of the phone with the cracked screen and put it into the phone that was bricked(means that it wouldn't even turn on) and it worked, It was the coolest thing I had ever seen and he explained everything too. Way good service.< /Review>

I came in to get my new Galaxy S8 Plus unlocked internationally. They were very helpful and explained everything that need to be done. They had multiple ways of unlocking them and since I wasn't in a rush I chose the inexpensive route. Thanx IA!<//review>

This place has the best customer service hands down! I came in to ask for an estimate, and I ended up not only repairing my screen, but adding a glitter skin on my iphone. Will definitely recommend this kiosk to my friends!< /Text>

My daughter's phone cracked and the screen started cracking more and more. I brought it here and they did a fantastic job replacing the screen. In addition they replaced the battery that was inflated and was causing the screen to have pressure marks. I didn't even know that could happen, I'm glad I was able to change the baterry before further damage was caused to the phone. This is my go to place for our cracked phone and IPad screens.</review>

We came in to have an iPhone 6 screen repaired, it was really cracked and we were helped in under 20 minutes so it was really fast, we were able to walk around the mall and by the time we were done the phone was ready to go and it works great! It was also a reasonable price compared to another kiosk in the mall.</Text>

Very helpful, since they applied armor on my phone it has been bullet proof, I've dropped it several times and subject it to a lot of abuse and still no scratches, I highly recommend Invisible Armor< /Text>

< Review>
This place is conveniently located off the 55 freeway in Tustin offers an invaluable service to clumsy individuals that are prone to breaking their smartphones. The staff is knowledgeable, very friendly, and able to repair/protect a large variety of electronic devices. The store itself is very well kept and offered countless types of cases and skin combinations for my Samsung Galaxy S5 and MacBook Pro. They even do custom shields for all types of electronic devices!</Review>

< Review>
Had to get my LCD repaired on my iPhone 7 plus. I didn't think my phone could be repaired but I took it to Daniel and he was very courteous and professional. He told me it would only take half an hour and he was a man of his word. Will be going here with any future needs< /Review>

(Translated by Google) If I can give zero points, I don't hesitate. I came here to change the screen of my mobile phone, and the color display of the screen is very different from the original one! Moreover, after they changed the screen, my Home button could not be used normally. They were unable to fix this problem.

(Original)
如果可以给零分的话，我毫不犹豫。我来这儿更换了手机屏幕，结果屏幕的颜色显示和原厂的有很大差异！而且他们居然换了屏幕后导致我的Home键无法正常使用，他们没有能力修复这个问题。</review>

<text>(Translated by Google) These gentlemen are liars, one of them told me that I would change the full screen to my note 5 and q would basically have a new phone for 300 because the screen itself is a piece that gives the images I asked a couple of questions to the q I attended and told me the same thing that would take me a new phone because the connection of the headset does not work well and the connection to load it not at the end just changed the glass front and back and did not know what they did but only work well of the connections a couple of days and today again I can not use headphones. I thought if they would change the whole screen since it is only worth more than 150 in Amazon while only glass costs 20. But not only did they care to make money from a client and that's it.

(Original)
Estos señores son unos mentirosos, uno de ellos me decía q le cambiaria la pantalla completa a mi note 5 y q básicamente tendría un teléfono nuevo por 300 ya q la pantalla en si es una pieza q da las imagenes le hice un par de preguntas al q me atendió y me decía lo mismo q me llevaría un teléfono nuevo debido a q la conexión del audifono no trabaja bien y la conexion para cargarlo tampoco al final sólo le cambiaron el vidrio del frente y atras y no se q le hicieron pero sólo me trabajo bien de las conexiones un par de días y hoy otra vez no puedo usar audifonos. Pensé q si le cambiarían la pantalla completa ya q solo esta vale mas de 150 en amazon mientras q solo el vidrio cuesta 20. Pero no sólo les importó hacer dinero de un cliente y ya.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>
