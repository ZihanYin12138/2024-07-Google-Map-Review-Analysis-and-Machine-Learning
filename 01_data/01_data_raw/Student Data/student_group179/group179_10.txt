A long stay in the neighborhood, with the oldest brick oven in Los Angeles. The oven definitely brings out unique flavor.

Now I know why the locals keep coming back. When this COVID is over I want to try the dining room.

I tried a large pizza 1/2 pepperoni, 1/2 pastrami. And it was excellent! Brix is now my favorite pizzeria in South Los Angeles.

Thanks Brix for making my day! Keep up the good work 👍.< /Review>

The pizza, was mediocre at best. But I didn’t expect much considering the price. The taste of the pizza was not the issue. The customer service at this place is sub par to say the least.

Because I didn’t arrive within 10 mins of placing my order, the chicken wings I ordered were sold. The girl’s exact words were, “ You took too long so I sold them”. She also stated, “If someone would have wanted your pizzas I would have sold those too”.

I placed this order on a Friday night. How do you run out of food on a Friday night, sale items ordered over the phone and then not offer an alternative???

Needless to say, this was my first and last time being a patron at Brix<//Review>

I hate spaghetti... I really do... its not my cup of tea. Today I was really craving it. I ordered the spaghetti with meat balls for the kids... omg... they have the best tasting balls... 🤤🤤🤤 and the night before I ordered some pizza with white cheese and garlic chunks. Bomb... 🔥🔥Crust is good too. It's like a mod pizza crust.<//review>

Pizza is ok, nothing to wow about like the other people who've reviewed this place but for the price it was good I payed $8 for a large pepperoni pizza with jalapeno and mushrooms which was a steal according to pricing these days and as for the pasta it was definitely a big flop I ordered fettuccine Alfredo with chicken...... Let start with the pasta it was spaghetti not fettuccine and the sauce was completely broken and watery and also grainy all at the same time the flavor wasn't bad but u can tell it definitely wasn't fresh or probably came out of a jar u buy at the store and the breadstick which was a single breadstick by the way was horrible.</Review>

This is my go to pizza place. The fries are not amazing but everything else is incredible. Would 100% recommend over dominos or Pizza Hut.< /text>

<Text>Chicken fettuccine alfredo was disgusting it & first of all they used spaghetti instead of fettuccine (how could u mess that up lol), a little bit of diced chicken, and it all came swimming in a massive amount of some wierd soupy sauce thats tasted like warm milk and ricotta cheese very unpleasant taste. tasted NOTHING like chicken ive ever had anywhere. do not waste your money on this and please upgrafe or just take this off the menu so nasty. Pizza is okay although i asked for pesto on my pizza b4 i paid and he asked me again "pesto?" To make sure but when i got the pizza no pesto smh< /Text>< pics>

The pizza is delicious! The price is good as well. I have not tried anything else. Although the pizza is good, there has been times the bread is kind of chewy and hard to swallow. If the Pizza  gets cold , it won’t be that good no more .<//Review>

<review>This food is nasty. It's not fresh at all. The cheese they use is wrong. I've ordered a few pizzas and one sandwich and each time I ate their food I got sick. The girl behind the counter told me she doesn't even eat the food there, not the way they serve it anyway. If you don't care what garbage you eat and only want to save a buck, this is the place for you.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

(Translated by Google) No. Try to put an order and the girl Who answers. It doesn't even let you think that you're going to order everything to the races. From there we already started badly

(Translated by Google) You order a pizza and they give you what they want. It was not a good experience.
Just because I live far away I couldn't go to make a claim.

Took my kids to play and enjoy the beautiful weather.  Love the open space and enjoy people working out while I eat. Always a good time. My kids thought it was great also.< /review>

Another gem in Balboa Park. Small playground for kids, big field for picnicking or laying out on a blanket. Usually less busy than across the street. There's a cute coffee truck that is often parked nearby.</text>

This corner of Balboa Park is so amazing. It's high up so you can see the skyline of downtown and Balboa Park buildings against a sunset. There's plenty of parking nearby. There's a child playground, some tables to sit at and lots of grass. There's a walkway that showcases birds which is special.</Text>

Great neighborhood park, lots of sunshine, bring your own shade! Or good for tanning. One bad thing is there are no bathrooms. Plenty of space to lay, play, and relax. Have a picnic and enjoy the view of downtown.<//Text>

<Review>Just put in paths and new plants and has good view of city. Only swings for kids though and no bathroom. Pleasant for picnics or hanging out or throwing ball to dog. Gets windy so light sweater good to bring<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

It's a small, but very welcoming little park. The grass is beautiful, kept clear of doggie-doo, thanks to responsible owners. Always meet nice people here, too. Simple little play area for smaller children. The houses across the street are nice to look at as well.< /Review>

<review>So we rented a car for a day to drop off a family to San Diego, returned the car 5 minutes later than their closing time and dropped off the key to the box. We have always rented from the Airport and this is our first time on this location. 2 weeks later we got a receipt, normally we get it the day it was charged. We have been renting and we didn't really had any problems at the airport location. So we rented an Armada, so give or take for one day with taxes and fees should be around $200 max but NOOO we were charged $581!!!! We were charged for the days that they were closed, what was the use of the key drop off??? They said they had a disclaimer by the box but the airport never had an issue with this! If I knew I would be charged for the other 2 days I should have kept the car and used it!! This is very unfair, the guy over the phone was not understanding and just keep pressing on charges! I will never book here again and I do not recommend to book here. We are happy and thankful we can rent a car but over charging people during this pandemic???It really tells you business comes first!!!Never again!!!<//review>< gmapID>

Hertz booked a reservation on Rosedale Hwy. Location over the phone, then later the next day I  received a call no car was available. I had an Important Medical Heart appointment at the Veterans Hospital in L.A. it took me months to schedule. Thank God I had a relative that saved me by taking me. The Woman was rude on the phone at Rosedale location and was not at all understanding of my situation nor would help me contact other Enterprise locations.< /Text>

<Rate>4< /Rate><text>Easy to make reservations, and also received a confirmation call the day before I was scheduled to pick up the vehicle. The vehicle was in good shape and met our needs. Only 4 stars because when I went to pick up the vehicle, the employee notified me that I was lucky they still had the vehicle I reserved, because it is a highly sought after model, and since my scheduled pickup time had passed (12 noon, which their system defaults to), I was lucky they still had it. I arrived about 2 pm.  I was unaware that they don’t guarantee the vehicle after your scheduled pick up time, even though you are required to reserve It with a credit card.  Maybe that info is in tiny writing somewhere.

Regardless, everything turned out fine and our trip was uneventful as far as the rental car process is involved.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

I was very happy with my rental experience here. To start with, the ladies that helped me both checking out and back in with the car were super helpful. Everything was quick and painless. I went for a full size this time, and got a really clean Altima with leather interior. Had a blast driving it. Thank you!</review>

<review>Have rented from this location approximately 5 times over the last few years.  Employees have always been polite and competent at their jobs.  Some of the employees have been there for awhile now which is nice as dealing with new employees can be frustrating.  Fairly quick in and out every time and sufficient staffing. Selection of cars seems to be limited at times so if you need a specific make or model ask ahead of time and double check.</review></record>

10/16/2018 Our car was going into the shop after having been rear ended last week, our insurance company arranged a rental through this location. A lady called to set up the rental over the phone yesterday both my husband and I were on speaker phone with her and she told us the car wouldn't be ready until *after* 12:30 today.

We run a small business and were unable to get down there until shortly after 1pm. No car. They rented the car to someone else because we weren't there right at 12:30 on the dot. They claimed we had been told on the phone that we needed to be there right at 12:30 - both of us were on the phone and no such thing was said. And, it was an semi-extensive conversation as she took down all of our personal info (drivers license, etc.) supposedly to expedite the rental process and was sure to tell us we needed to pay a $50 deposit.

So in all that detail she didn't make clear or emphasize AT ALL that we needed to be there right at 12:30 - but she was sure certain to make sure we told her EXACTLY what car repair shop our personal car was going to be at - not sure why she needed to know but she waited while we dug through paperwork to get the information.

When explaining this to the person behind the desk at the office the only reply received was, "that's not how we do things." So much for customer service.

Our insurance company arranged the rental. Our car was going into the shop for 2+ days - it isn't like we weren't going to show up to get the car.

I've rented numerous cars and have never run into this sort of outrageous nonsense.

Customer service here is atrocious.

Updated 10/17/2018 to add:

Called my insurance agent who made some phone calls and magically, Enterprise on Rosedale managed to get me a car by 5pm - when previously I had only been offered a more expensive truck or nothing until the following day at 3pm.

Upon arriving at the office was greeted by Jasmine who announced, "Glad we had a car for you this time."

The manager, started my paper work on the rental with the comment, "Oh, yeah, we just picked you up." And, then promptly passed me off to someone else and retreated to her office. The professionalism of this establishment continues to amaze...

I was treated to a pre-rental inspection of the car from stem to stern with all the courtesy and professionalism law enforcement typically reserves for the common criminal pulled over at the side of the highway.

To take the cake, this morning I find myself trapped in a GROUP TEXT MESSAGE sent to numerous other customers from the cell phone of some employee at this establishment - asking if there was anything we could do to improve their service. So, now my phone is going off every few minutes with people complaining about that (I was one of the people who complained).

When scraping the bottom of the barrel of customer service and setting the bar as absolutely low as possible - the professionalism, courtesy, and service of this establishment is absolutely unmatched.< /text>

I called the number I found on line for booking at the Rosedale location, but apparently I ended up at a call center. The rep made the reservation as well as scheduling a pickup at my work location for drop off at the Enterprise office in Rosedale. When the appointed pickup time came and went, I called the Rosedale office directly and was told that no pickup had been arranged! Of course I have no way of knowing where Enterprise dropped the ball, I just know I was delayed by a half hour. The car I was given was the one the Rosedale rep picked me up in and I was not offered any alternative choices of make so, as I was pressed for time, I just took the one offered. Had Enterprise not goofed on my pickup and if I was given a choice of cars in my preferred size category I would have happily given this office a five star rating. Also, no other accommodation was offered, such as an upgrade or discount for their error.<//Review>

This location is okay if you're in a pinch however I hate using them for car rental reservations. I much prefer the one over on 24th Street in Bakersfield. Since Enterprise is a franchise services and policies are not the same across all locations!!! This location wanted my deposit, rental amount PLUS the insurance and all applicable taxes UP FRONT! The one I normally use takes my insurance out of the deposit upon returning the rental. It's ridiculous I had to have almost $400 upfront for not even 2 days!!!!!! I would like to also point out that EVERY time I get a rental from them (enterprise) it is always dirty! this past time they only wiped half of the windshield on the inside after they sprayed it so there were large window cleaner spots on the windshield (not safe for driving) and random tire pressures on the tires. (I shouldn't have to worry about checking these things when getting a rental but sadly EVERY time I have to, it needs to be ready to drive when picking up!). Maybe I need to start using a different rental company in the future.</Review>

<Date>1511195824485<//Date><Rating>2<//Rating><text>My wife and I rented a full size car from the Enterprise location on Rosedale Hwy earlier this month. The car was certainly NOT clean! If fact, I found some spare change under the front seat, along with a dried up lemon slice, and a month old receipt from an out of area CVS! When my wife got the car home to begin packing for our trip, she first had to clean the windows/windshield inside and out due to them being filthy! That is when she noticed the cracked moon roof glass. We immediately called Enterprise and they advised us to return the car to them if we felt it was unsafe. We returned the car but the car they offered to replace it with was a Jeep Renegade (a box on wheels) or a full size Suburban {gas hog}. We decided to keep the Ford Fusion Hybrid with the cracked moon roof glass. Thankfully the moon roof glass did not break during our travels. The staff was accommodating, but were not able to locate a different car for us that evening and we were leaving at 5:00am on our vacation.< /text>< Pics>

< Review>
I use Enterprise Car Rental quite a bit (or used to).  The only way I use Enterprise any more is if I can't find any other car rentals.  The main theme for Enterprise is "We will come and get you!"  That's a joke.  Every time except for once I've been given some kind of line about how "you don't have anyone to come get me, you aren't in my area, we don't do that at this facility."  Every time I rent a car online, I ask for a certain type of car, and every time Enterprise promises me that certain vehicle they can never produce it when I show up there - after I get a ride from Uber to get to their facility.  It's not just this particular Enterprise, it's every Enterprise that I've been to.  If you don't like what I'm writing, then you should quit sending me emails for my opinion.<//Review>

I will never again rent from this Company.  When I returned the car they associate was too busy to drive me back home, approximately 3 miles away.  His excuse was he was staffed too thin.  There were two associates working at the time.  Very poor customer service from a Company who picks up their phone and says "we'll come pick you up."  Yeah right....You won't have to worry about me again.  I guess it's time to give Hertz a try.<//Review>

They have plenty of premium vehicles available.  It's very hard to get a less expensive rental.  I tried for 3 days.<//Review>

<review>Doctors and staff are great! Trying to call in for an appointment or getting a call back after leaving message nearly impossible.  Funny how the voicemail states "please only leave one message because it could slow care".  They know it's a problem but don't fix it. It's been a couple of days with no call back. Lastly, I don't feel comfortable giving "out of the country outsourced operators" my name, DOB etc.<//review><Gmap_id>0x80828487ef1a20e7:0x4d8c3ba02bd5e39b< /Gmap_id>< pics>

It’s been months.  They still haven’t figured out what’s wrong.  Some of the people that work the front desk are extremely rude.  I was told to book another appointment at the front.  Then when I tried they wouldn’t because I didn’t know how many weeks.  I thought omg did this doctor just drop me?  Or did the desk make that decision?  I may never know.  What I do know is that I feel extremely jerked around.</Text>

I went into  Shasta orthopedics with High Hopes. One of the doctors there was highly recommended. I met with the doctor and we went over pre operation  information . My problem came with after the surgery was done. I did not get to speak to the doctor to find out what he did to my ankle. When I return to Shasta orthopedics for my follow up the doctor was still too busy to see me which,  I found VERY unprofessional. If somebody’s gonna cut into you and do surgery he should see you after the surgery or at follow up to Discuss how surgery went and what he did. Six weeks later I was sent to physical therapy.  My physical therapist had many questions for the doctor and or the practice and left two phone calls that were never returned. I ended up going to physical therapy to soon causing additional injury to my ankle.  I left two messages to speak to the head officer in charge. No one returned my calls. And the final straw , I requested a copy of my medical records which they did not know I already had . They went in and changed and doctored up my medical records they do not match.  Why did they feel the need to change three pages of medical records?</text>

<Review>All the medical staff here are excellent and you won't go wrong with them. I have one huge complaint. You will never see the same person twice. I think they run you by every PA and assistant in the building just to give them all some experience. They will call to verify an appointment and give you the name of a doctor or person you have never heard of. Eventually you will get to the doctor you were originally referred to, but you will go through every person in the building first.</Review>< Pictures>

Very poor customer service.  Referral sent 6/29. I called 7/9 since I hadn't heard anything.  Told it was logged 7/2 and I should hear week of 7/12.  By 7/20 no word so called my doctor for a different referral.  New referral and into new doctor on 7/22.  Shasta Orthopedics finally called me 7/23 to say they wanted to set me up with an appointment with Dr.  xxxx.  I told them 3 weeks to get a call for an appointment was unacceptable.  People making appointments at this facility are in pain and 3 weeks waiting to just schedule an appointment is extremely unacceptable knowing that it's still 2 to 3 weeks out to even get to see their doctor.  Never again with this place and I have to agree from other posts about their billing practices as I fought them for months on my last visit for their billing errors.  There are other doctors and facilities in this community to see besides these ones.  Stay away at all costs or you will be sorry.</Review>

My experience at Shasta Orthopedic has not been very good. Way overpriced for what you receive. I have been put on hold multiple times for way too long. This afternoon I was put on hold for 30 minutes waiting for the billing department to answer. When I decided to call back because I figured they forgot me the office was then closed.

Shasta Orthopedic billing is very confusing and even the woman I spoke with admitted that it was confusing. She told me my bill was paid off and one day later I received another bill for $250. Watch for hidden costs like laying on a traction pillow while you wait for the chiropractor to see you and then be charged $45 extra for that service. Since many insurances pay for a basic adjustment, all the additional charges are out of pocket. Discuss with the doctors everything they do and ask them if you will be charged for it. I sure wish I had done that.< /Review>

Another horrible experience.   Uncaring staff provide the worst customer service I have ever experienced in what is supposed to be a professional atmosphere.    The front desk staff as well as the 2 medical assistants I met were rude beyond words.  I suggest finding a reliable and professional organization and avoiding the frustration and poor attitudes of these people from the get to.  Save yourself the frustration.  Really.< /Text>

< Review>
Shasta orthopedics billing is so messed up. My wife paid a debt of nearly 300 dollars due to insurance not covering some of her visits. That's understandable, however there was a separate 40 dollar charge from nearly a year and a half ago that just went to collections because we had no idea it existed. It doesnt make sense that she had two separate debts there and that it took them 14 months to send it to collections. The doctors and clinical staff are great but the billing is terrible and I feel they are very inconsistent in their charges. If you go here prepare for some serious headaches dealing with the billing dept.

Edit: also it says a lot about the business that they only respond to the (very few) positive reviews. They dont care to fix their problems.</Review>

I asked the third lady whom I was passed through on the phone for appointment and of course with intervals of about 15-20 minutes each and listening to repeated info on their doctors explaining how qualified they are and even what their hobbies are! to tell me if she herself has ever tried to make an appointment for a doctor at this center? She answered no. I requested her to ask one of her relatives to do it!< /text>

<Review>This is Jan's wife. I saw PA Doll. He administered three steroid injections in my right hand.  Ultimately the third injection was administered incorrectly creating an abundance of swelling and pain and lack of use of my hand for over a month and continuing.  Also staff "medical assistant" was extremely rude. The staff there must not enjoy their jobs.  After speaking to our daughter who is a hospitalised for Kaiser Permanete, we have scheduled an appointment with another orthopadic for consult regarding treatment received and what should be done now to eliminate this awful pain. THIS ALL STARTED THE MIDDLE OF FEBRUARY. NOW ITS THE END OF MAY.</Review><Date>1590371770823</Date>< rating>

< Review>
Customer service is lacking in respect, efficiency,  compassion, and timeliness. Hold times on phone are upwards of 10-20mins. It has been this way for years so it appears as if they don't care. Maybe if we had a similar facility in Redding Shasta Ortho. would step up their game some. If you do need to go in for an appointment be sure to get an early morning one! We've had wait times of upwards over an hour for 2 different surgeons.</Review>

After 15 phone calls and 4 voicemails over the course of more than a month I’d rather take me business elsewhere. It disgusts me that I just want help and they don’t care nor want anything to do with helping people.

PS change your hold tones. Nobody cares about accomplishments of a physician they won’t get to see. Nobody cares about your candle making hobby and your PhD.<//Review>< user_id>

This place has 2 stars for a reason: Patients are coming to you for help...If you treat them like they are a nuisance and not worth your time (even if their issue is not your "specialty"), when it is they would rather drive hundreds of miles not to ever go back to you, even if they do need you in the future.
5. Work on listening to patient, not talking over them, like you know everything already..because I guarantee you don't, people are wonderfully different, unfortunately so is their pain, their bones, and problems.
6.  Karmically speaking, Dr Paige you might need some help someday, I hope the Dr you see treats you better than you treated us today.</review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

The lady who does the physical therapy on my elbow is nice and appears knowledgable, however the office staff are pretty awful. After my appointment I tried to pay my 40 dollar copay and was told that  no one knows how to accept my copay and that the woman who normally takes them is out. So, I was told I can come back later today or pay 80 bucks next time. I'm busy and dont have time to return today nor do I want to pay 80 bucks next time. The fact that they didnt appear to care, and acted like it's normal to not have anyone at the front desk to manage things is very concerning as I dont like surprise bills in the mail. Dont recommend. Doesnt feel like the office staff know what they are doing at all.<//Review>

Absolutely terrible customer service. Cheryl sent us to a desk behind her to get checked in when we were next in line and about to be checked in by her. So we went behind and stood for 10 minutes and they didn’t help us. We walked back to the line Cheryl had and she had seen at least 3 different people before telling us that she “didn’t have eyes behind her head” because we were waiting for so long. Incredibly rude and then began saying that she had an attitude and short temper because it was lunch rush. No one in customer service (when their company is already 2/5 stars) should be talking to a customer like that.

Also, have been seeing them for two years and each time I come, I tell them he problem I have is my foot and they keep messing up.  They put in an order 6 months ago on my ankle, and made me pay for their meds up. It is my foot, towards my toes and they could not figure that out after so many visits. AFTER being corrected multiple times. The MRI that was given, completely missed the place where my fracture is and they are just now beginning to understand their mistake. After I’m done here, I’m NEVER coming back. I urge you to find another place to get service because this is not the place you want if you expect respect and professional workers.</Review>

<Text>Most of the past year has been a total nightmare! Guess Workman's Comp Cases are not this facilities favorite!  Had seen Dr. Swartz for about a year to get relief from my torn meniscus surgeries that were useless in 2014 by Oroville quack! Dr. Swartz came across as concerned, caring and from all I researched on him made me confident he could help me.

I lost my job in December due to many unnecessary delays in performing approved total knee replacement. I went out on medical leave 10/20/2017 thinking I would be back to work by March 15, 2018......the administrative, scheduling and reception staff is the worst I have ever encountered. They had various turnovers in staff during my experience and those that failed to follow through with needed clearances delayed my surgery until late June,  2018. So many lies, I documented all and they add up to more than 15!

I did not get proper physical therapy until three months after surgery. I complained profusely at my followup visits that the pain was making me crazy, raising my blood pressure and I felt something was wrong. Now last day of October, the doctor ordered new pictures and ended up taking tissue out of my knee for analysis! I have not healed properly or have an infection!

Worse yet, was told I might have to undergo a removal and new knee implant! I don't think I can handle it!

Dr. Swartz, I believe is a good and dedicated surgeon who has not been aware of the horrible staff situation and mishandling of my case until I began informing and complaining to him! Each time progress was made and he was not happy with the delays. It's no wonder he no longer is at Shasta Ortho except for one day a week.

I truly think if you want good care throughout your ordeal, find another facility with good rating, caring, conscientious and professionally trained support staff!< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<review>Felt like I was BS'D the whole time.
I denied a student from coming in with the "DR" and the nurse snatched the papers aggressively in front of my face.
I got no help, no answers and a cold shoulder.
No respect unless you have real medical.
Horrible experience.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

It saddens and shocked me to  read these reviews. I had a fusion by Dr. Jones, I had 2 carpal tunnels release surgeries, my husband had 2 carpal tunnel release and 2 ulnar nerve surgeries done. ALL surgeries went perfectly. The doctors and staff have always been responsible and extremely professional and efficient. Now my husband is looking into 2 knee surgeries. We as patients also have responsibilities in our care. Yes sometimes we have to call the office more than once. They are a busy practice. And yes sometimes we don't always get to see the doctor after post care, but believe me your doctor is under the plan of your care. He knows what surgery he did and he stays available to be consulted.< /review>

<text>DO NOT give up on getting your appointment. Take charge and keep calling all day if you have to.It took me two months to get in. With the help of my nurse at my primary Doctors, we hounded the referral Lady for 45 minutes on a Thursday and Friday I finally had my appointment for the following Tuesday. I see Doctor Jenkinson and Doctor Sabat. Their nurses and assistants are always making sure I am doing good. When you walk in the main doors, the people at that desk portray a "oh no not another one" kind of attitude and that has been changing with better training and replaced staff. Keep trying and don't give up. You will get great care there.< /text>< pics>

< Review>
I was seen very quickly, after being referred to Dr. Jenkinson for a broken scaphoid. I got a little lost trying to find the right check in point and so I checked in a little late. It was understood, kindly, by the receptionist. I didn't mind because it is a beautiful building and the decor was awesome. Dr. Jenkinson and his staff treated me very well. The gentleman that put on my cast put a pretty green stripe on a purple background. He knew it was hard for me having it because I was assaulted by my daughters boyfriend and granddaughter's father. They have kept me from my granddaughter for the last 2 and a half months. So, the cast is a awful reminder of that day and he tried to make it better to look at. You don't see much of that kindness in the healthcare industry anymore. Believe me, I know, my health is not so good so I see a few specialist. They make you feel like you are in a revolving door and never stepped off. Wow, I'm rambling but I did want people to know how good it felt to be treated with the respect and kindness everyone deserves. Cudos for Shasta Orthopaedics, Dr. Jenkinson and his staff. I felt they deserved to know how a elderly lady left their office with a warm heart and big smile on her face for the first time since this happened. GOD BLESS AND THANK YOU ALL!.........Well, I was referred to Dr. Ferraro and he he did surgery on my hand and wrist. I was scared but the surgery was a success and I now have little to no pain where they removed my joints and used tendons from my arm to replace them. After lots of Physical Therapy with Kevin Snider and his team, I am pretty much good as new. Thank you Dr. Ferraro for your excellent work and compassion (you too Bill).</Review>

<text>Plain and simple, they made my life better.  4 years after a botch surgery by someone other than them,  the doctors there got me back to being whole.  Dr. Jenkinson was awesome and he cared; Dr. Schillen did a great surgery.  While I may never run again, I can at least get up off the floor without help.  They truly change my life.  Thank you so very much.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><user>102384443970880488308< /user>< response>

Shast Orthopedics. I have always received compassion and good care from the women at the front desk  to  medical assistants and doctors. Also, everyone in between. I live with chronic pain and migraines. Shasta Orthopaedics has help me get my pain to a tolerable level where I can live my life and continue to do my job as a massage therapist, business owner and also as a mother of five. I will continue to go there when needed and recommend that if you are seeking orthopaedic care that Shasta orthopaedics is the place to go.<//Review>< Pics>

1. Received automated confirmation call on 8/26..call said appt at 10:45am
2. Get there 10:35 am..we are told we're late.
Service desk very nice...medical staff chip on their shoulder about us being "late".
3. Working with nurse coordinator for husband's care and she is scheduling these appts...Dr. Paige had issue that we had seen another Dr in the same field "so what are you here for?"...very short, dismissive, rude. We don't know..our insurance sent us to you...get that way with them..not your patient who needs help.
4.

This facility is a joke! It took months to get my disabled daughter on the schedule.  Then moved her appointment two times. Gave her another appointment  two more months out and told me they couldn't guarantee they would not have to move it again. You guys aren't the only ones with a schedule.  This is completely ridiculous.  Let's see how your business continues after doing business like this.< /text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>I have a rare genetic disorder, and I met with Dr. Jenkinson. I was shocked to learn that he has actually treated a few people with my condition (most doctors have not even heard of it). Dr. Jenkinson helped me get physical therapy, wrist braces, and a bone density scan. He also helped me find treatment for nerve pain. One thing that’s really cool about this place is that they do x-rays right there in the office. Normally I would have a dr. appt, then have to schedule an x-ray or imaging, then wait to hear back from my primary doctor. At Shasta Orthopedics, I was able to see my doctor, get the x-ray done, and then have my doctor come back and explain it to me all in one appointment. I was even able to request a paper copy of the x-ray and receive it that same day. The elevator and bathrooms are very accessible. The waiting rooms are nice, and there is a small coffee shop next to the front desk.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

The billing department has no clue what they are doing.  When I ask a question about a payment or service they ask me to hold to find the answer.   It takes a few minutes every time this happens and when they return to the phone they have information that normally doesn't even answer the question I had.</review>

<Review>I would give it a lower rating if i could definitely going to give it one when i take it to the board for discrimination from day one. Started going to Dr Sebet in 2015 for back problems after several problems with staff and Dr and many years and beratings straight disrespect to my disabilities los of my personal exrays which i later found out were tossed and a bill for !150 for missed appointment. Which i never received a text or reminder call after they have been informed i had a memory condition. Then when making a appointment i asked for one later in the day because my worker didnt come til 11 i needed assistance to get ready i was told since u dont work if you got up at 7 there is no reason u cant be at 10:00. Omg these people deal with the disabled on daily basics. Shame on the staff. I have seen4 dr here over my life time Dr schilling A+ dr Ferrio A+ dr jenkins D-  Dr Sebet F--

Most of the past year has been a total nightmare! Guess Workman's Comp Cases are not this facilities favorite!  Had seen Dr. Swartz for about a year to get relief from my torn meniscus surgeries that were useless in 2014 by Oroville quack! Dr. Swartz came across as concerned, caring and from all I researched on him made me confident he could help me.

I lost my job in December due to many unnecessary delays in performing approved total knee replacement. I went out on medical leave 10/20/2017 thinking I would be back to work by March 15, 2018......the administrative, scheduling and reception staff is the worst I have ever encountered. They had various turnovers in staff during my experience and those that failed to follow through with needed clearances delayed my surgery until late June,  2018. So many lies, I documented all and they add up to more than 15!

I did not get proper physical therapy until three months after surgery. I complained profusely at my followup visits that the pain was making me crazy, raising my blood pressure and I felt something was wrong. Now last day of October, the doctor ordered new pictures and ended up taking tissue out of my knee for analysis! I have not healed properly or have an infection!

Worse yet, was told I might have to undergo a removal and new knee implant! I don't think I can handle it!

Dr. Swartz, I believe is a good and dedicated surgeon who has not been aware of the horrible staff situation and mishandling of my case until I began informing and complaining to him! Each time progress was made and he was not happy with the delays. It's no wonder he no longer is at Shasta Ortho except for one day a week.

I truly think if you want good care throughout your ordeal, find another facility with good rating, caring, conscientious and professionally trained support staff!< /review>

I had an appt scheduled with Shasta Orthopedics. Unfortunately, due to several wildfires burning around my home, I missed the appt. At the time, the only thing on my mind was whether or not my home would burn (came within acres of my home and my business). All roads in and out of my area were closed and I was essentially gridlocked where I was, not even able to drive the route to the office if I wanted to. I called the business as soon as I realized I missed it. I was told I was being charged the full amount of the visit and since it was a missed appt my insurance would not cover it and I was on the hook for the entire amount. I tried to explain the situation to them, but they refused to even listen or help. They ended up fastracking my missed appointment to collections and had my first ever nonpayment ding my credit (an 809 credit score at the time, which went down to a 685 after this). I begged and pleaded with them to make an exception due to the extreme situation and they absolutely refused and told me "its not their problem". Worst part was, I called the after noon of the appt to let them know I had to miss it as I lived 1.5 hours away due to the fires and they still said "too bad, its not their problem".</review>

<Review>DO NOT give up on getting your appointment. Take charge and keep calling all day if you have to.It took me two months to get in. With the help of my nurse at my primary Doctors, we hounded the referral Lady for 45 minutes on a Thursday and Friday I finally had my appointment for the following Tuesday. I see Doctor Jenkinson and Doctor Sabat. Their nurses and assistants are always making sure I am doing good. When you walk in the main doors, the people at that desk portray a "oh no not another one" kind of attitude and that has been changing with better training and replaced staff. Keep trying and don't give up. You will get great care there.</Review></record>

I was seen very quickly, after being referred to Dr. Jenkinson for a broken scaphoid. I got a little lost trying to find the right check in point and so I checked in a little late. It was understood, kindly, by the receptionist. I didn't mind because it is a beautiful building and the decor was awesome. Dr. Jenkinson and his staff treated me very well. The gentleman that put on my cast put a pretty green stripe on a purple background. He knew it was hard for me having it because I was assaulted by my daughters boyfriend and granddaughter's father. They have kept me from my granddaughter for the last 2 and a half months. So, the cast is a awful reminder of that day and he tried to make it better to look at. You don't see much of that kindness in the healthcare industry anymore. Believe me, I know, my health is not so good so I see a few specialist. They make you feel like you are in a revolving door and never stepped off. Wow, I'm rambling but I did want people to know how good it felt to be treated with the respect and kindness everyone deserves. Cudos for Shasta Orthopaedics, Dr. Jenkinson and his staff. I felt they deserved to know how a elderly lady left their office with a warm heart and big smile on her face for the first time since this happened. GOD BLESS AND THANK YOU ALL!.........Well, I was referred to Dr. Ferraro and he he did surgery on my hand and wrist. I was scared but the surgery was a success and I now have little to no pain where they removed my joints and used tendons from my arm to replace them. After lots of Physical Therapy with Kevin Snider and his team, I am pretty much good as new. Thank you Dr. Ferraro for your excellent work and compassion (you too Bill).</text>

Only taking into account the Doctors and (most) M.As I would give them five stars. I have been seeing Dr. Jenkinson for consults, and Dr. Sabet for procedures since August 2016. They are both WONDERFUL doctors who are EXTREMELY caring. Jarrod is the best nurse EVER. Shout out to Jarrod! My problems are with the admin people who are COMPLETELY incompetent. I had to chase them, and do their jobs for them. Dr. Jenkinson's M.A. has never returned even one of my calls. Lesley, who books the procedures shouldn't be working with people, let alone people who are in chronic pain.<//Review>

I have seen two Doctors here. The last time I went was waste of money. Doctor couldn’t seem to focus and knodded off several times while looking at computer. Then wanted me to let him do injections on my knee but couldn’t explain why that was needed. Was also looking at old X-rays.<//text>

< Review>
It seems the low ratings on Google and Yelp are well deserved. The reason I gave 2 Stars not 1 Star is:
Dr. Ferraro did surgery on my elbow and it does seem better so far. Although my full range of motion hasn't returned yet.
While under anesthesia I was also given a carpal tunnel surgery even though I don't have and have never had carpal tunnel! I don't know if this was Dr. Ferraro's decision or Shasta Regional Medical Center's, in order to get more out of my insurance or simple negligence/incompetence. If Dr. Ferraro is half the doctor many claim he is, why is he operating out of one Northern California's filthiest, most incompetent hospitals(SRMC)?
I cannot in good conscience recommend Shasta Ortho. to anyone under any circumstances!< /Review>

The entire experience was ridiculous and aside from the first visit and surgery, I never got to see the doctor. The information post surgery, relayed via the PA, was nothing like what the doctor said and I had no improvement.

My next experience was with my arm broken, just below the shoulder and I saw Dr. Lange. Nice man, but it stops there. My arm should have been pinned, but instead he opted to just put it in a sling to heal. After months of agonizing pain and physical therapy, he told me to come back in a year. A year later and still limited motion in my arm, it turns out the bone healed off to the side (malunion) and my only option was to rebreak and pin or an artificial shoulder. The man saw me at least a dozen times and never mentioned it wasn't healing properly.

I hope to never go back to Shasta Ortho and am going to try my luck with Redding Ortho to fix my shoulder.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

I went in for a shattered clavical. Dr. Chang and his assistant told me it was the worst clavical break they have ever seen. Did absolutly nothing for me. No brace, no instructions besides "try to keep it still".  Told me he was going to get a second opinion from the surgeon Dr. Swarts who never physically examined me. And from the front view of the x-ray you couldnt determine how far my clavical was pushed back. After 12 weeks I went for another x-ray and still my clavical was a nonunion. Dr. Chang says "thats not good" and when i told him it still hurt he said "it shouldnt" but still no further treatment was propossed. Dr. Changs treatment was non existant the second oppionion was based of an x-ray which has no depth. Now 4 months after my injury my sholder is still in pain and without treatment. Poor service at best!<//Text>

I just went through a year long billing nightmare with this office.  Only to end up owing over $500 for an office visit that was supposed to be a $25 co-pay.  I wrote letters and made phone calls and didn't get a response for three months.  Just beware may send you an outrageous bill for a simple office visit.</text>

I had a very expensive MRI in the meantime and when I finally got to my appointment the doctor had not reviewed my MRI because he couldn't find it.

They didn't give me any clear directions on how to get where I was going, the building was like a maze trying to find your way to the correct place. When I did arrive, which was early and had plenty of time, the front desk receptionist cut me off as I was speaking and was very snarky and rude. The wait time was relatively reasonable for as busy as they were, the doctor was very nice and trying to be thorough but the support staff leaves a lot to be desired.
Also, I have been waiting for over 2 weeks for them to arrange a physical therapy appointment. I've left a message nobody has responded to the message. They don't call back, they don't communicate, they just leave you hanging and when you try and call and get help they just connect you to a voicemail which is never returned. I wish there was another option with my insurance. It wasn't the doctor and it wasn't the wait time but the support staff needs to be
much more patient friendly.  (people dealing with the customers out in the lobby and in the check-in.)< /text>

Fantastic job repairing my original furnace here in Vintage Hills, Temecula. On time, found defective part, found part bad 'holding' the perished part. Had to do a bit of pipe work to get to the bad part; had to track down aftermarket part. Everything works; everyone super nice on phone and Evan doing the work. Price was reasonable for amount of work done, new parts. Highly recommended.< /Text>

Great company....A+ experience!!!

We just bought a home with lots of odd and end plumbing work that needed to be done ASAP. On a Monday, Jerry the owner came by to check out the issues and did not oversell or make us feel pressured in any way!! We were informed, educated and he kept it 100% real & honest....just 2 days later we had Jon come out take care of business!!. He took his time, did great work and was super personable. All of our issues were fixed quickly and cleanly. There is no doubt we will be using Liberty again down the line.  Overall, we had a great experience with Liberty and would recommend to anyone and everyone!< /Text>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>I already knew I needed a new garbage disposal and two new toilets, so naturally I called Liberty for these jobs as I've used them in the past for major work like heat/air and ducting. I know that their pricing is always fair (I do my research), and everyone who's ever come out is very professional and kind. Steve and Jose did all the plumbing installs. I never thought I'd be excited about new toilets in my home, and I couldn't be happier! :D
As long as I live in the area, I know I'll only be calling Liberty for any future repairs or new installs.
Thank you!</Review>< Pics>

Liberty kept in constant contact with us before, during, and after the pipe repair and water heater replacement.  John is incredibly professional and skilled at his job.  Great install John!  He answered all of my questions and was completely transparent about pricing.  I’m very happy with how quickly they were able to help us as well as the quality of their work.  Would recommend to anyone and everyone.</review>

The drain pipe under our house was leaking. We called Liberty and they were able to replace the rusted out cast iron pipe quickly, for a very fair price. They communicated throughout the process, updating us on what was happening and asking questions, when needed.

They showed up when promised, began the work right away and made sure to inspect the pipes for leaks before they left.

They exceeded my expectations and I will highly recommend them to anyone I know who needs plumbing work. Great job, Liberty!< /Review>

<text>Jerry and David were on time and went right to work. They were very informative and knowledgeable while showing me everything they did to inspect our furnace, filters and air conditioner unit for preventative maintenance. They were professional, clean and courteous. Never once did they try to up-sale me products, and they've got a great value on their yearly maintenance program. I highly recommend Liberty for all your air conditioning and heating needs!< /text></record></dataset><record>

David & Jerry were awesome!!! 😁 I originally called another company because my AC went bad (they were the same company I used only a year earlier). Long story short, the other company gave me a high price to fix a bad circuit board & wouldn’t fix the issue for 2 weeks because they couldn’t get the part & charged me just to show up. Fed up I called around & someone referred me to Liberty. They were the complete opposite: no fee just to show up & diagnose the issue, honest, fast, & very courteous. David also checked some of the issues the other repairman told me I needed fixed, like replacing my AC unit. He found there was nothing wrong with it (honest). He agreed the issue was the circuit board as well. David & Larry came back with the part in only 2 hours, fixed the issue in 20mins, and for $200 less than the other company 🙂 I was so satisfied, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEM! And I will use them if any other issues come up for sure.<//Review>

Liberty Plumbing Heating and Air Conditioning was recommended by family members and after our great experiences, we recommend them to everyone too. They have been caring, responsive, honest and thorough. We first called for help diagnosing an issue with our A/C. In the middle of summer, they were at our house the next day. This is a family owned business with a lot of heart. I think I interrupted dinner one night when calling about our broken garbage disposal; I was expecting to leave a message but Deanna was happy to talk me through whether we were dealing with an emergency or not. When Jerry and his assistant arrived and confirmed the disposal needed to be replaced, they took time to let my 10 year old son "help" them. I told them he thought he could install it himself after watching some particularly empowering YouTube videos. Needless to say, I'm so glad the unit was installed professionally. The kindness shown toward my family warmed my heart and we're grateful to have Liberty to call when we need them.<//Text>

David has been awesome!  The quote I got from another company to replace the bad unit was HUGE.  While the price is still large, it was at least within reason with Liberty and quality was perfect from the factory.  Installation was efficient but spent enough time to make sure it was done correctly.  It was NOT rushed.  Office staff I have spoken to have been very friendly and helpful although things are running flawlessly.

I absolutely would recommend Liberty for work...< /Review>

<Date>1588888667972< /Date><Review>Have had numerous plumbing issues since purchased current home a few years ago.  Had  tried a couple different plumbing companies.   Since I’ve tried Liberty 2 years ago I do not call anybody else.
No need to as they are the whole package.   They get me scheduled promptly, confirm day before appointment, service tech calls when on his way with arrival time estimate.  Is friendly & respectful & give helpful advice. & price up front.  Cleans up after the job is completed & asks if any questions or if I have anything else that I want him to look at while he’s here.   Prices seems fair for work being done.
So pleased to know I have Liberty as my go to A/C, heating & plumbing company.   I have used for all 3 services & won’t  use anyone else</Review>< user_id>

We hired Liberty to come out yesterday afternoon and they were able to show up first thing this morning! Our service tech, David, was right on time and very pleasant, clean and thorough. He had to crawl up into our attic through a very narrow passage in the rafters to access the area of concern. He investigated,  took pictures, came down and gave us the good news that everything we fine and no further work there was required! We had a second issue that I asked him to look at. He isolated and fixed that issue in less than an hour.  We were very happy with his service and would recommend them to our family and friends. We will definitely use them in the future!<//review>

I was pleasantly pleased with professional services that Dave and his helper ( sorry I can’t remember his name) They were very prompt and efficient. They were so knowledgeable and cleaned up very nicely after the job was done. They also took the time to explain how to operate everything and program my nest for me. I would definitely use Liberty again and they have some keepers having David as one of their employees and also the other gentleman. I will be recommending Liberty tiny friends and family. Thank you Patricia Piper for referring them to me.</Text>

<Review>i would just like to say a extremely huge thank you to jose and jerry the owner as well,  there are not enough positive words that i can put in writing about jose.  Jose worked very hard all day on both my furnace as well as my shower. it is very hard to find young men like jose who work as hard as him, there was nothing that stoped him from trying to figure out what was wrong, he was very nice, kind, respectful, professional, fun, personable, humble, very hard working and also very friendly. If there was something that was in question and he needed more information he would call jerry the owner and ask him.  He never guessed at anything, it always had to be done both the right way and the correct way.  I am very impressed with him. People like jose are very hard to come by these days, he works very very hard as well. the  quality of his work performance is  very important to him as well. Jose was also very reliable, responsible, dependable, trust worthy.  He called to let us know that he was on his way also.  I greatly appreciate people like jose. I have never had a service tech come out to my house and work so hard.  He multi tasked working on 3 different things in my house, he also did an exceptional job installing my new shower head. As i said i cannot say enough positive and great  things about jose.  The man is a rock star.  I honestly
truly and greatly appreciate him alot. A million thank yous to jose and jerry the owner of LIBERTY PLUMBING. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU LIBERTY PLUMBING FOR SENDING JOSE TO MY HOUSE, I AM TRULY GRATEFUL, THANKFUL AND APPRECIATIVE FOR THE QUALITY OF WORK THAT JOSE DID. SINCERLY A LOYAL CUSTOMER OF LIBERTY PLUMBING, IF YOU NEED A GREAT COMPANY TO USE, THIS IS IT, CALL DEANNA OR HIS WIFE CHRIS AND SCHEDULE AND APPOINTMENT. MUCH LOVE AND APPRECIATION TO THIS COMPANY<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

< Review>
Technicians were on-time, did a quick and thorough check  of my system, gave me some options, then fixed the problem.  This was an A/C problem, but I have used them in the past for a  duct problem, and at other time(s) they installed a new water heater, and a new A/C compressor.  Add to that is that they are a veteran owned business, and as a veteran, I like to support veteran owned businesses when I can.<//Review>

<text>Liberty Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning, Inc. is an amazing company. I've been using the company for more than 14 years and I've been pleased with each and every job. Amazing customer service, great prices, and guaranteed work.

Most current job - Move washer/dryer from the garage to inside home. Job entailed demolishing shelves in storage room. Reroute all plumbing from garage to storage room. Steve, initially came over to give me a quote for the job, but decided he could complete the job that same day. Steve gave a great quote, estimated time frame of completion, and removed demo trash. All goals met and work complete to satisfaction.

I highly recommend Liberty for all plumbing needs.

I am so glad that I used liberty plumbing who took care of myriad issues that I had with a new home.

First off the office was courteous and professional in setting up the jobs.  The team was phenomenal.  They were punctual and also very professional and friendly.  A shout out to Steve who was absolutely great.

Now for the different jobs...

1.  I highly recommend getting the water purification system they recommended, the Halo 5.  My drinking water is completely different and tastes great.  Washing up feels so clean!  They also did a great install and made all the connections and drainage seamlessly.  The owner, Jerry, went over the options before buying this and he saved me from buy additional under sink purifiers that turn out to be unnecessary and this save me money.  Other companies were selling me much more expensive systems and additional under sink systems with additional connections to my appliances.  It would have been so complicated!

2.  My furnace and air conditioning setups were not to code and in fact the mounting of the furnace was a complete disaster.   They fixed the mount from a mess of 2x4s which were nailed all over the place to support the system.  Now it is properly suspended and earthquake rated.  They  also discovered that several connections were configured properly for the best airflow and functioning of the system. It was a difficult under the house job and they got it done.

3:  And I have to mention my connection to the city sewer line... or lack of a connection!  They were able to get to fix a disconnection that was almost 6 feet underground with what seemed like an impossibly small hole for the team to get down to and fix.. thanks Dave, how did you get in there??? All done and patched in one day... and the concrete job was better than what seemed like a spot where previous work was done.

They are coming back to address a few more issues, but I couldn’t wait to write a review.

Overall a professional courteous team that does a great job and when they are finished the place is cleaned up and in tip top shape.  The owner pay close attention to the jobs and checked in on the work several times through to ensure the best work was done.  They also found ways to save money with maintenance plans.. the jobs were so big that the discounts from having a plan will pay for itself for years.

I am so pleased that my AC and furnace won’t fall off in an earthquake and have the right connections; the water I am drinking is now healthy and pure... and my sewer actually drains to they city sewer system instead of under the road!

Anything you need, they will take care of you.</review>

The staff are very Professional and considerate. They are prompt and thoroughly explain the issue, once they identify it. The pricing is fair and reasonable. I would recommend this company and Dave, the Technician, to anyone.

UPDATE - On 01/10/2020 I had to call on Liberty, again, to replace a leaking Water Heater. Once again, they responded quickly. Steve, the Technician was both Professional and Friendly. And the price was cost effective.

Again, I would refer Liberty to anyone needing an excellent Plumber, HVAC, or Heating Technician.< /Text>< pictures>

<review>Steve did a great job fixing my water problem. Deanna was very helpful getting my appointment scheduled and sending Steve out. I highly recommend Liberty for their great customer service and a job well done!

Update: I had to have Liberty out again to correct an issue with the previously installed pressure valve.  It was making a high pitch sound.  Justin came out to fix it and did a fantastic job. It's the reason I go with Liberty.  They honor their work and have extremely knowledgeable and professional staff.

Justin also found a problem we had with the hot water pressure. There was a block in the water line to the water heater. He fixed it all up for us. The noise is gone and the water pressure is amazing. Thank you again Justin for coming out late to fix our issues and for your great work. We will absolutely use Liberty again!<//review>< GmapID>

Just to let you know, I've never been so pleased with a Plumbing company as Liberty Plumbing.  Justin the repairman was so prompt, (right on time), efficient and knew his job.  Right from the start, he went straight to the job, took care of everything, was clean, neat and very polite.  I would recommend their company, prices and staff, I give you guys 5 stars.
Much thanks and when I have plumbing needs they will be the first ones I call.

I also appreciate Angie's from directing them to me.  Much thanks.

everything went right.  the gal who answered the phone in the office.  the ease by which we made the appt.  her patience in explaining pricing, etc.

two techs came out on the right day at the right time.  they took time to explain what they were going to do and how much it was going to cost.  i took advantage of a package that included a return later in the year to check out my air conditioning and perform a maintenance.  they then did exactly what they said they would do......in booties!< /Text>

<review>We originally had called another AC repair company and they never called back. The we called Liberty.
Steve came out and serviced our AC unit on a very hot day.  He was very efficient in diagnosing and fixing the problem.  He also checked our coolant level and  compressor as part of his visit.
We are very happy with the service and would call Liberty again if we need AC/furnace repaired.
We would recommend Liberty Plumbing and heating.  We should have called them to begin with!!!</review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<Review>I dealt with this company 8 mos ago and here I am again, called them to service my 15 yr old air conditioner and once again they did a great job.

Below is my previous experience with them.

I highly recommend this place,  my air conditioner stop working on Labor Day, I called them for service and was told that they could send a service person that day, but because it was a holiday there would be a charge of $200.00 however, if I was able to wait until the next day, I could have a service person arrive at 10 am, without a service charge. I agreed to wait since on Labor Day  I had had another company come and check the air condition and had said that I needed a new motor it would cost $900.00 which I turned  down.
The service man from Liberty arrived the next day promptly at 10 am and after checking the air conditioner motor he said that I needed a new capacitor, he said this was common, the price $235.00 I asked if the service was guaranteed and he said, yes for 1 yr
So I gave him the ok to do the work and within 30 min my air conditioner was working as good as before.</Review></record>

< review>
David was especially efficient.  My heating and air conditioning system had not been serviced for a long time and he was very thorough.  He even had to make a special trip to get a HEPA filter that is not in high demand.  In fact the parts house  only had   one in stock.  He explained everything he found in detail so I could understand exactly what needed to be done.  The final invoice was exactly what he quoted.  In addition to his technical skills he was extremely pleasant to deal with.  The five stars are truly deserved.

Two weeks after the service on my HVAC equipment my water heater started leaking from the bottom and had to be replaced.  This time Steve came to my rescue.  He was every bit as helpful and efficient as David had been.  My water heater is behind a pegboard wall in the garage and Steve removed it and moved other items that were in the way.  And he did all this without any complaining or "sighing", even though he had every right to do so.  Steve was truly a joy to deal with.  This company deserves five stars across the board.< /review>

Saturday morning we were awakened by a drip-drip-drip from the ceiling, which turned out to be a pinhole leak in a cold water line in our attic. The timing could not have been worse, as we were hosting a party that afternoon at 4!

Deanna was super responsive, and at 11 committed to have a tech do the work in time for the party. When I hadn't heard by 1:30, I checked in. Her tech had run into problems with the job he was currently working on. She and Justin (and the other client) teamed up to suspend the other job for a few hours to get our leak fixed.

Justin arrived at 2:40 and did a thorough and professional job. He had to crawl hands-and-knees through our hot attic, but he had it fixed and tested before our first guests arrived. He even offered the Angie's List discount unprompted!

Liberty Plumbing saved our party!< /text>

Liberty recently completed some plumbing work at our commercial building in Hemet and we couldn't be more happy! Everyone at Liberty has been great to do business with. They are honest, professional, and they focus on quality while keeping expenses down. Steve and Justin did a great job on the plumbing work and we're looking forward to having them back for some more work that needs to be done. We are happy to have found a plumbing/AC company we can trust!<//text>

Had an issue with our Moen cartridge in the front room shower. Called Liberty and Justin was out at the house within the hour. He was extremely professional and fixed the shower cartridge in no time! Thanks Justin! I would recommend Liberty to all.</Text>

< Review>
Honest company with good morals and values. They installed our new AC unit and furnace. The owner of the company met us in person and gave us an amazing deal. They are very military friendly (Veteran owned and operated) and caring. They even paid for a temporary portable  AC unit for us to use while we waited for them to come and install.
We were under contract at first with Costco but their company had Us sign paperwork that was against Costco policy so we got out of that one but we are so grateful we found this company.  The cost of everything that was done was half the cost of Costco and works amazingly.
I would recommend this company to everyone and anyone I know because it’s really hard to find honest companies nowadays. The owner even came a week after install to make sure everything was done properly. You just don’t see that nowadays.
Thank you !

After years of having a non working A/C unit, I thought for sure we would need a whole new HVAC, as my home was built in 1988.  Pleasantly, we only needed a new A/C condenser.  His installer was timely, neat and professional.

To make a long story short, I had a very complicated heat pump issue.  Old units (+15 year), no access, home warranty company jacking me around and an unknown rodent issue.  I had three contractors check out this situation.  Liberty is the "thinking" HVAC service company.  They made the others I spoke with look like complete drones.  In short, yes I still have a long term problem.  Heat Pumps like all pieces of equipment wear out and need to be replaced.  I am fortunate to have enough money to fix this problem along with many others in the 1986 wine country house I live in.  It is difficult to find good contractors and nearly impossible to find great ones.  I work with them all the time with a property like this.  Do not hesitate to give Jerry a call at Liberty.  This is my GO-TO when it comes to HVAC moving forward.  They will get a call back in the next couple of years when these old units get torn out.  This is how a business is built and a reputation is developed.  Nice work guys!!< /Text>

<Review>Hi

Cade Davis,  your master air condition service provider, initially provided a quote and then when agreed.  We decided to have the work completed he installed a new compressor in our existing Air conditioner. He completed the work  in one day and had the system up and running. Lets hope the system will provide us a carefree cool summer.

Thanks a million,

< Review>
Called Liberty concerning a suspected hot water slab leak in my kitchen & a team arrived ahead of schedule the next morning.  Both Kade & Sargon were professional, courteous & hard-working throughout the discovery, diagnosis & repair phases.  Kade was thoughtful & methodical is his approach & successfully determined the source of the leak, then provided me with several repair options & estimated costs.  They worked straight through the day & into the evening to complete the reroute through the attic using pex piping/new copper fittings, & water service was fully restored before they left.  I appreciated their neatness in wearing gloves & boot covers, laying down mats & tarps, & cleaning up at the end of the project.  Kade was both informative & knowledgeable, answering all my questions.  I was very pleased with the outcome & would highly recommend them for any plumbing needs.  The 10% military discount was appreciated as well!< /Review>

Liberty is an honest company to do business with! My air conditioning quit working on one of the hottest days this summer. Kade was very professional and knowledgable, he replaced a part in my AC and installed a Wi Fi thermostat. I am a satisfied customer and recommend to friends and family.< /Review>

<Text>Good honest people!  Great prices and stay true to their quotes! My mom had 2 other plumbers go out to her house and convinced her that she needed a new Water heater. My sister told me to try Liberty Before doing anything and Jerry, the owner, came out and said she just needed a $125 part. A week later Jerry called and said the employee that had my moms part had quit and took the part with him. 2 days later Jerry showed up and did the install free of charge! Needless to say, my whole family has used them ever since!  Hard to find honest hardworking people that won't try to upsell you these days but Liberty is "those" people!< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

< Review>
I called Liberty plumbing on Monday morning because of a clogged drain leading from the kitchen sink to the main sewer line and Jerry said he would try to get someone out by afternoon.  This clogging has been a constant problem for the 20 years we have lived at this home and I was always able to clear it myself using a drain snake.  This time I could not get the drain clear.  Steve and his helper arrived at 11:30 Monday morning and using a combination of an electric powered snake and a gas powered water pressure hose they were able to clear the blockage.  I could not believe the junk that came out before they cleared the blockage.  It appeared to be white chunks of chalk or joint compound that may have been in that drain from the time of construction causing the many times I needed to snake out the line.

The service charge was exactly what was quoted.  I would highly recommend Liberty Plumbing.  .< /Review>

Waited about 100mins to got my order! Who else can beat this record?!

Ordered at 6:07pm, got my order at 7:45pm... checked the waiting time with their waitress for more than 3times. At the very beginning, they told me the waiting time is 45min.

Safety concerns: some waitresses with no masks and gloves for preparing the food!<//Review>

Food safety?
食品安全？

I was a regular customer of My BBQ before yesterday. But the experience happened yesterday make me banned this store permanently.

I ordered some to-go food and after I went home I am happy to enjoy the food until I saw a pen at the bottom of one of the dinner box...

This pen is not even covered and my friends and I had already eaten most of the foods in that dinner box. I am not sure how much ink I ate into my stomach???

I felt bad and called the merchant to complain. I told them there is a pen in our foods but they told me they can provide us some free food next time and didn’t want to do any compensation on this accident?

Is there anyone going to a restaurant again who let you ate a pen??? What do you mean for giving me some free food next time???

I ate at least ten times in My BBQ after I came to the Bay Area because the taste is okay for me. But I will never go again since I don’t want to eat pen and ink again :)

The red circles dinner box in the picture is the #pen box :)<//text>

They always tend to omit something in my order, and never refund even they said they will. They are doing it on purpose and to all customers.
They’ve been forced shut down for not wearing mask in Lockdown.</review>

Store is small and cozy, with retro vibe. Not busy on a Monday night.
Food was good. BBQ sticks are average priced, at about $2/stick. Lamb scorpion pot was also good.
The potatoe was cut very thin and ended up floppy, the chicken skin was not crunchy at all but super soft and sweet, and the large shrimp was very small. I would not recommend these 3 items.
The wait time is horrible though. Despite the lack of customers, we still waited over 2 hours for our food. The server also forgot our orders for all the vegetables, and it wasn't until we had the manager check it that we found out. He ended up giving us a free beer and apple juice as apologize but it was still unacceptable since we ask the server to check but she kept brushing us off.
Would still recommend the food and restaurant but be ware.<//review>

However, the kidney I ordered is still medium rare after I reheat my takeout, are you kidding me? Minus one star at least.< /text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMynJTug99BAznYFSB6WPs2VBpVxblXlSoyb3SV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x808fc8b0fb136a6d:0xd5adab48ab39d259<//gmapID></record>

<Text>My family ordered food for my birthday, we’ve tried many other bbq in Bay Area and I have to say the taste here is fine. However, I also have to give a one star feedback due to food safety issue as other have pointed out. All my family had stomachache after eating the bbq and I even vomited. This will be the only time we order food from this restaurant and I seriously don’t recommend ppl taking the risks. I will also try to get FDA or relevant local authorities involved.< /Text><gmapID>0x808fc8b0fb136a6d:0xd5adab48ab39d259< /gmapID>< Pictures>

<time>1497842379263</time><review>To be fair, I didn't try any bbq. I only tried the 重庆小面 because that's in their Chinese name. $14 for Chongqing Noodle with pork large intestine, and I got 6 pieces of intestine and a ton of noodles with some peanuts and soybean toppings. The noodle tasted alright, but I was thoroughly disappointed by its value (meat quantity and quality).<//review><user>106995104092230058741</user></record></dataset><record>

<gmap_id>0x808fc8b0fb136a6d:0xd5adab48ab39d259</gmap_id><review>I'm an avid foodie regarding Chinese BBQ and I've been to almost every Chinese BBQ place in South Bay.  The lamb and pork belly BBQ is definitely top tier, however the rest of menu I tried falls short to match the quality or flavor, thus taking one star off. The noodle collection is particularly bad, it is basically instant noodles and far from authentic Chongqing Noodle, pricing at $13 is a total rip off compare to Fu Niu Tang or Classic Guilin, thus taking another star off.<//review>< name>

<text>(Translated by Google) Ask the waiter to help get the water. She pretends that she can’t hear her and shouts three times not far away. She still pretends that she can’t hear. The service is very poor. The menu is also slow in the back kitchen. Didn't she say bad things or pretended that she didn't hear the acting is great 👍🏻

(Original)
让服务员帮忙拿水她假装听不到 就在不远的地方喊了三遍她还是假装听不到 服务态度极差 菜单给的也慢 在后厨说客人坏话 有趣的是客人听到了问她是不是说了坏话 她还是假装没听到 演技非常棒👍🏻< /text><Gmap_id>0x808fc8b0fb136a6d:0xd5adab48ab39d259</Gmap_id>< userid>

<Review>(Translated by Google) As a Chinese-style barbecue taste really good.
Added: Yet once went to many people, busy with other waiters, etc. Let dry for at least 15 minutes before the a la carte, but also pay back in 10 minutes to come. Although a lot of time in the restaurant service is not good but this is absolutely the worst experience ever. So angry I turned into a two-star to five-star 😷

(Original)
味道作为一家中式烧烤的确很不错了。
补充：然而有一次去人不多，服务员在忙别的让我们干等了至少15分钟才点菜，后面付账又要等10分钟才来人。虽然中餐馆很多时候服务都不好不过这绝对是体验最差的一次。气得我回过头把五星改成了两星😷< /Review><pics>None</pics><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x808fc8b0fb136a6d:0xd5adab48ab39d259<//gmapID></record>

The ingredients don’t feel fresh, and the meat has a smell. I’ve waited for a long time, but I’m completely disappointed.

Anytime I have an issue or question, I know that he is going to respond quickly and execute his promises. He is the consummate professional! His approach is always one of Understanding and Dedication to Problem Solving. If you are thinking of moving to the Glen, I would suggest calling & asking for him, as he will answer all of your questions and do whatever you need to be well-informed and equipped to move in, seamlessly.

The Glen made a very wise decision in hiring him! Not only is he knowledgeable of his job/ skilled, but has an amazingly, positive attitude that is so useful in working with the public, especially during a Pandemic. He is an incredible asset to this Community! Thank you, Mr. Jomel for all of your hard work, you are very much appreciated!< /text><Name>Ka Li</Name><user>110948710255877888179< /user>< pictures>

Website said there were summer leases available (May-July) so I started doing all the research, application process, and scheduling a tour. The day of the tour (after all the paperwork was submitted) they told me me there were NO summer leases available. They claimed there was no 'promise' made when we started the process and the 'final paperwork' was not completed so they could change their minds and not offer the summer lease. However when you put effort into something like this you expect the company to at least allow those in process to continue with the terms they were offered, or at least be notified before the day of the final tour that things have changed. To add insult to injury, on the same day they said they would not honor their original offer, the website continued to offer the summer lease! Beware of a company that markets a promise (makes you an offer) and then fails to honor it.<//text>

<Text>This place is the most wonderful place for who want to live with mouses. If you want to live in here and do not like the mouse, I recommend to you prepare cat which is good at catching mice or you have to be friend with mouses and share the area together. Because Glen workers does not have  experience and  ability to solve the problem. They are just useless and most of them except two persons are just csusb students. They may be good students, but they are not good workers. They really need more training and I really hope them to work with sense of more responsibility and enthusiasm from the customer's perspective because they do not work for customers, they just work for two managers. More serious problem is that these two managers think about their customers as simple machines that pay for Glen. Be careful and have enough time to more thinking, before you sign the Glen document to live in here. Because they will serve you as a king or queen until you sign the papers, but since you signed, you are no longer a king or queen for them, you are just a slave(like a naive dog) of Glen for one year. I hope you guys will not be deceived by Glen's appearance. I really want to give Glen five mouses but I can only express their quality with stars. For this reason, I give to five mouse in here  -( %:> -( %:> -( %:> -( %:> -( %:>

Karina and Glen, in the office, were more than exceptional. Karina has a vast amount of knowledge that made me feel comfortable and confident this will be my new residency. Glen has a very out going personality and was excited to see what I had chosen. It was exciting to such nice assistance. It’s rare these days and shouldn’t dismissed.</Review>

I am currently looking to relocate and was recommended to check out the Glen apartments. I called the office and spoke with Semaj’ and she was extremely helpful. Trying to relocate to a different state can be frustrating but she answered all of my questions and made me feel at ease. I can’t wait to tour the complex when I visit.</Review>

Her warm personality made me feel at ease in the complex, especially since this was my first time renting an apartment.

< Review>
In all honesty after signing my lease in August , I truly have no regrets. It is a good first start for those looking to move out because of its affordable living prices for not only students but to others looking to rent as-well. I can’t thank enough to Johana for always checking in on making sure if everything was okay , a very kind young lady ! She always been helpful with any situations or questions that I have had ! Not only her but also to the rest of the office staff who are all so kind !< /Review>

The Glen Apartments provides its residents with exceptional service. I couldn't be more satisfied with moving into The Glen. Ever since moving in the staff has been very friendly, accommodating, and helpful. Jomel has been incredibly kind and attentive in helping me with all of my concerns. The team at The Glen is amazing!

I truly enjoy residing at The Glen. The location is perfect as I am a first year student at Cal State San Bernardino. There are several restaurants nearby and the walking path is beautiful.Everything you could need for an apartment   is easily accessible. Jomel  has great customer services. He was able to answer all my questions.</Text>

This is a great location if you are attending CSUSB, if not, I think it is still a great community to live in. The amenities here are great; gym, pool, jacuzzi. The workers at the leasing office have been great to me, they have always been helpful and friendly to me. I had a matter in my room fixed in a reasonable amount of time. I would recommend this community to anyone looking for a place to live, it has many options as far as prices and room layouts.< /Review>

My daughter lives here and I can’t think of a better place for her to be for school. As a mother, it’s very hard to see your kids leave home for college. My daughter still has labs she must attend in person and the location to Cal State is perfect. The majority of the utilities are included, as well as the furniture. You get a bang for your buck. Much nicer than scary dorms on campus. The staff and Alejandra are very friendly and helpful.< /text>

Great place to live & spend your 4 years in college. Nice view of the mountains, and fire wings is right across as well for those wing lovers :). Got to speak to Johana a staff at the glen recently and let me tell you, she had the best costumer service I’ve ever experienced. I’m talking Chick-fil-A times 10 service. I would 100% recommend living here.</text>

<review>The Glen Apartments is a very enjoyable place to live. Not only is it well maintained and the management is responsive when problems come up. I appreciate how efficiently and responsive  the property manager is. Never in my life have I met someone so professional, and down to earth. She did such a great job answering any of my questions and concerns which were met in a timely manner.  I highly recommend The Glen Apartments if you're looking for a great experience and it is a wonderful atmosphere for students.<//review>< pictures>

the worst management ever. once you sign the lease their face and act like a dog won’t help you with parking or solve your issue. Also, if you rent any kind of room everyone can hear you. it’s not worth it in this ghetto. save your money and time talking to them and go find other place<//Review>

I love it here. It was really hard and a long process to finally be accepted for the studio I wanted to take over, but it was definitely worth it!! I haven't had any issues with bugs or rodents in our home. I love the dog friendly community. My girl trindle has made friends in the complex c: maintenance is always on top and ready to help out. I have nothing but good things to say about the glen. The one and only thing I have bad to say, is I have a terrible roommate on the third floor... oh, and also the strict parking. Like cmon!! It's guest parking.. why do we need guest pass? I hate that.< /text>

< Review>
Mr Charles from leasing office always helpful , customer oriented.

My current roommate with his girlfriend . Smokes pot , as a general rule  NOT TO SMOKE INSIDE THE APARTMENT.

I have been complaining about the smoke, SMELL of et al.
And is still going on smoking pot in the apartment specially at night the whole apartment  smells SO BAD AND LINGERS ON MY CLOTHES.

WHERE DO YOU SEE A GENERAL RUL IS NOT FOLLOWED OR NOT SUCTIONED OR MEANS NOTHING BUT JUST WORDS.

I HAVE ASKED AND TALKED ABOUT THIS WITH  THIS ROOMMATE, THE RESULT IS NOTHING.</Review>

<username>Nolan Leavitt<//username><text>From the outside view, this place seems like a decent college housing unit. When I moved in the carpet in the common areas as well as my room was disgusting. I had issues with one of my roommates stole from us and smoked in his room and management refused to handle it. The management is terrible here. They hire college students to handle situations they are not prepared for. Additionally, there's no requirement to be a college student to live here. They would move people in and out of the vacant room in our unit without even telling us. Things would break and it would be impossible to get someone to fix them in a reasonable manner. If 2020 was an apartment complex, this would be it.< /text>< response>

I've been at the Glen for about 4 months and I have to say it's one of the greatest places I ever lived!  The staff here is very helpful, we have a gym on site, a heated pool & jacuzzi, as well as a rec room... and the people that live here are very friendly & the place is pretty quiet for the most part.

Ryan is the manager there and he's just a joy to deal with whenever there's a problem, which there hardly ever is.< /review>

<review>There are ups and downs to this place for sure. It's on the pricey side, but the location close to campus is amazing. The rooms are decently sized, and it's nice to have your own bathroom. The kitchen's are really nice, but one fridge is too little space for 4 people. The amenities are really nice, like the pool and fitness center (though a stair climber would be super nice to ad). It is frustrating though that they insist on packages being sent to the office despite the office taking a day or two to process them and sometimes forgetting to send emails about them being there (which they require for pickup). Management is really nice and they try and do a lot of fun things for residents, but communication is problematic. If they say that they can do something for you or that you can do something, GET IT IN WRITING and make sure they put a note on the account because someone else will tell you something different or say they don't have record. For example, when I was moving in I told them I wanted a parking garage in my building, they said okay you are on the list. Then I got an email saying I wasn't. Then I called again and they once again said okay you have it. I also emailed about 5 times saying that I wanted it. Then they emailed saying that no one signed up for the garage in our apartment so they gave it away to someone not living there, despite my numerous calls and emails saying I had it. If they say you are on a list or that you have gotten something GET PROOF and hold them to it.< /review><gmap_id>0x80c3518e345bb70d:0xc3701af7e52ad3a<//gmap_id>< Name>

Do not rent here!!! This place advertises like a student living and it’s not true. False advertising!!!!!!  They rent to any person. They don’t have to be students. They have a no smoking policy but they don’t enforce it. My daughter complained several times of roommates smoking weed and the roommates were never kicked out.<//text>

Management is the worst here. All the managers don't know how to manage. I don't know how this place is still in business because the office managers are a joke. Very sketchy organization, they steal money and pick favorites. Stay away . All the 5 star reviews are fake because they force people to leave good reviews lmao.< /Review>

This place is very nice. The maintenance team are absolutely AWESOME. Always on top of things in a timely manner...THANK YOU

I have a studio here. The price is just right considering EVERYTHING that’s included. Only downside is the parking. I have to park across the street at the college, which I’ve been getting tickets because the college hasn’t sent me my parking pass($114). (Which I had to pay for even though I don’t attend the school. Just so my car wouldn’t get towed. The tickets are a whooping $52 bucks each!....add that to the rent!!) THATS the downside.

Security doesn’t keep check on people being noisy and on top of that parking is just a mess. The only redeeming quality this place has is it’s maintenance workers. Everyone else is just a student showing up for the paycheck. If you don’t like the job than get another one and give someone a chance who can do it better.< /Review>< pics>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Text>I have lived here for five months and have had my apartment broken into TWICE! The first time, our living room tv (under the Glen’s insurance) was stolen as well as $500 worth of scooters (that our renters insurance does not cover). The Glen put in a chain lock on our back door after the first break in, but of course we were broken into again. This time, burglars tried coming into my bedroom!

I only advertise this because the Glen is not a safe apartment complex. They claimed to have upped security after multiple apartments were broken into the first time. This was obviously not the case if my apartment was broken into a second time.

The Glen apartments are supposed to be safe and affordable living for students attending California State University, San Bernardino, but the Glen leases apartments to anyone and everyone. They do not track that their renters are students. This puts all students living at the Glen at risk because we do not know the people living here at the Glen.

San Bernardino is not a safe city, but the Glen claims to be a safe living space. Now, we can see that the Glen is not.

The Glen claims to be doing everything that they can to fix the issues that their residents face, but it doesn’t seem like they are. Okay, they put in chain locks on our back doors...after 12+ apartments were already broken into. Isn’t that just them trying to cover  themselves so we THINK we are safe? I think so.

Besides the break ins, the internet is spotty. Sometimes we can go days without internet access and the Glen will not day anything or send out emails as to why there is an outage of the internet that we, as residents, pay for.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>{'time': 1582567766021, 'text': 'Thank you, Jessica, for your feedback.

Office staff does not have an interest in helping new moves in at all . I haven’t even moved in yet and it’s off to a horrible start. A guy named Charles promised to call me back but never did . I have to consistently hunt them down . No one ever reaches out to help you with your problems at hand .

I think they are pretty nice. The insides the outside is okay it's just their pricing has gone up ridiculously. They don't offer as much as they tell you they do when you're signing up or signing the contract. There seem to be pretty nice and quiet I don't live there myself but my child is there which they will be moving out soon because the prices are going up every year.< /text>

They have so many hidden fees, they charge you for every single thing and claim they are the cheapest place to live around the area. but they charge almost 900$ for the tiniest room and that’s the price they charge for 5 people living in one house EACH. their parking arrangements are terrible my roommate got towed out of her own parking spot that she pays for every single month for no reason and the office told her there was nothing they could do about it. The staff is rude except for a few of them. Maintenance are the only ones who are on top of their job. Living here is a scam.

I really love the staff they were very helpful and made everything very clear to me. The front office also does a lot to feel like home from afar. Never have I had an experience less than amazing and the gym, pool and lobby are very useful all times of the day. The managers shape up a big part of how I feel about the Glen and the tydiness of the complex. Key, Michelle, Cecilia, Gwen, Tori, Turner, Ms.Gonzalez, And Jim Watson are all very wonderful people and I really appreciate them and the rest of the Glen team!!!<//text>

<Text>The Glen has an immensely welcoming and kind staff, and wonderfully chic rooms and amenities; however, that's mostly where the good qualities end. For an establishment that caters to College students they do a pretty horrible job at offering prices that are reasonable. Truth be told the only reason I'm still living in said establishment is because they informed me that I still have to pay a years worth of rent (even though I've only been a resident for 3 months) if I move out. Since I moved in I can already tell there has been a handful of disputes within my living community, and none of them are even remotely close to being resolved. It feels as if the Glen is only good at charging people extra money. I had so much high hopes moving into the Glen, but it almost feels as if I'm stuck here because of unreasonable fees.</Text><UserId.>117500516324689548158< /UserId.><gmap_id>0x80c3518e345bb70d:0xc3701af7e52ad3a< /gmap_id>< Response>

I've been living here since the start! Sure there was a delayed move in but that was the only issue I have EVER had. The town homes are spacious, I love my roommates, it's only steps from campus, and they host fun resident events with free things! With the new management things have been GREAT. Not only is it great vibes in the office but the staff is so friendly & helpful. There's NO place like this!<//Text>

Great for student living, campus is right across the street. Units come fully furnished. Management is good now. Michelle is awesome!
Very limited parking, need more parking spots!< /review>

<Text>This place is ran so terribly they need to be reported to the better business bureau. Not only did they mess up my account for months by not charging me what they should have been (although I paid my full balance showing online every month! ) they took no responsibility for it! Now they want me to pay for their mistake and they have back dated my account 5 months! Don’t move here! You will regret it!<//Text>< response>

Do NOT rent at this place, we have been trying to get a refund for over a month and we just keep getting the run around,  we are unable to reach management via phone or email.  This is the worst place and the customer service is the worse, no one knows anything,  If I could give a minus zero  stars I would.<//review>

I wish I was able to read the reviews before I thought about leasing but because it was "new" I was extremely excited. Boy how that changed quickly.
First, move in was delayed practically a month due to the apartments not ready to be moved into (when I leased and every time I called they PROMISED it would be finished in time)
I ended up living in a hotel for the first week of school at cal state.
Also, on my lease I indicated "quiet" and no late night party animals. What do I get? The complete opposite of that. The first few weeks there were loud parties to the point where I could not even study, living here really messed up with my school work due to not only the loud disrespectful roommates I had, but the parties going on around me with it.
So if you don't care about your school or studies, definitely come here.
During the school year there is no parking ever (due to the never ending parties) which forces you to park far away from the apartment you actually live in.
Not only ALL of this but the residents who live here are absolutely disrespectful. They leave the place a mess are obnoxiously loud and have no decency for others and security doesn't do anything. Honestly, if the people living here were better people I MIGHT have stayed, but we all know the population of the Glen ruins it for everyone.
Heed this warning! I wish someone was able to tell me all of this before I moved in.<//Text>

HORRIBLE PLACE TO LIVE. Too many stupid parties, underage drinking, smoking, drugs, creepy people walking around at night. The staff are careless and useless whenever you have any sort of problem. They're just good at advertising this as a great place to live when really it's one of the worst. So many hidden fees it's not even cheap. Seriously after I moved in I regretted it because so many other places would've been cheaper and better. I've heard the Sunrise and Acacia apartments are better than the Glen. They're just money grabbing people who will be nice till you sign the lease then you're on your own. Seriously don't even consider this place. I wish I could give it 0 stars.<//review>

The Glen is the best living area around CSUSB in terms of amenities and decor, but that's about as good as it gets. The parking is horrendous. They gave me a parking spot through a special that they had but ended up making a mistake and were about to tow my car to create space for someone else even though it was their fault. You are lucky if you get good roommates, and if you do not then you are screwed because the Glen only wants the money, so they don't care if your roommate is breaking every single rule there is. They will not do anything to fix the situation. I wouldn't recommend living here unless you like unexpected fees, getting your car towed, and having crappy roommates.</Text>

<Review>The leasing office is very unorganized and slow when it comes to updating your balance , they nickel and dime you for everything. The roommate aren’t very considerate wouldn’t recommend and I won’t be renewing my lease honestly living here it’s not worth the price you are charged.....

I liked the idea of the glen before moving in but from the beginning the staff has been completely unprofessional and is a major why I hate it. The prices are way over priced for having a 12 month lease  plus you have to pay for parking. I'm glad I'm moving out because now they are taking away so many privileges that they garunteed. The only good thing about this place is it is furnished with a restroom but I would rather live in dorms than this place considering you don't have to pay for summer at the dorms.</Text>

I second what Robert Smith has to say, "The leasing office is very unorganized and slow when it comes to updating your balance , they nickel and dime you for everything. "

The only time I hear from the leasing office is when they're raising the prices on rent or when they want something from us. This place is run like a trashy college dorm and the leasing office acts like a dumb, uninformed R.A.Surprisingly, the only people who do their jobs accurately and on time are the maintenance men. I give this apartment complex 1 out of 5 stars.<//review>

This place is a total mess. Once you sign your contract you will be ignored. Any doubt or complaint will never be resolved. There’s NO security when needed. It’s a great place but very bad administration which really ruins everything. They will accommodate you anywhere you fit and you will end up living with loud people that will party until 3-4 in the morning and you will just have to learn to deal with it for the rest of your contract.<//Text>

The staff sucks, especially the chick with those fake colored eyes and black hair who think she has a cool job. She's so rude and is never helpful. Her attitude  is so bad and unprofessional.

The apartments are small and shared with 4-5 other people and you pay twice the amount you would in a spacious house with just as many people. The parking is horrendous and no one does anything about it. They make you pay a ridiculous extra parking fee and half the time your so called "reserved" spot is taken by some idiot who can't read a sign. Don't even try getting it towed like they say you can because half the time they either don't do it or they're not in hours. They also make you stuck in a year lease because they know how terrible it is to live here. While their advertisement is up to par for a 5 star apartment complex, the staff and living arrangements are sub-par and over priced. I can't wait to be out of my lease.</review>< pictures>

I have a picture of the rates they had advertised in their leasing center that I took on June 2 but she is telling me the rates have been raised since January so she is either lying to me or she was lying to everybody when they had the prices advertised. I have been here for two years and they do not care at all for helping existing residents there is a reason they’ve been through about 4 managers in 3 years. Do not believe a word they tell you about prices this place always gives you surprise charges and now they are literally telling me they can change the rent prices every day.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

If I could give this place ZERO STARS I would. HORRIBLE place to live stay far away! It has been nothing but issues since they have opened. First of all this place was just doomed from the start.

The parties, underage drinking, and drug use has made this place horrible. Management refuses to do anything about it. I have 4 roommates who did nothing but party constantly, drink (underage they were all 19) and smoke Marijuana, hookah, and other substances inside of our NON-Smoking Apartments. I have Asthma and was constantly having health issues to the point where when I went to the doctor he said my health had declined tremendously because of their behavior. I asked to be let out of my lease without a penalty given the circumstances and management still said NO! They offered to move me rooms and that was it.

The only problem with me moving rooms is that I HAD ALREADY MOVED ROOMS because of the same exact issue. Why not evict the people that are causing the issue? Why should I constantly have to be moved and thrown around like a pinball because all these Freshman can comply with the rules that are in the leasing agreement/contract. I am currently seeking legal action against this company and DON'T EVEN BOTHER calling corporate they will either not call you back or forward you to the regional supervisor Cynthia who is far from professional when speaking to her she just cuts you off and yells at you. STAY AWAY I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO MY WORST ENEMY.

The first manager was fired and then they brought in the new manager which wasn't doing anything productive either and now he's gone. This place just needs to close and Asset campus housing needs to be held responsible for their actions.

Myself and several others are getting ready to get a class action lawsuit and sue the glen or should I say Asset Campus Housing. For your piece of mind don't do it!

OH AND BTW The only Good review on their yelp page is by The General Manager of the place who no longer works there. Of course you're going to give a good review if you work here. Don't believe the good reviews on facebook either they are reviews given by either the managers, mangers friends, or  people who they tell to come and took a tour and give a good review. Look at the 30+ bad reviews about the glen then you will see how this place really is.</Review>

<review>Everything starts out great in the beginning but the higher up staff gets lazier and lazier. If you put down that you wanted a no smoking unit and the people in your building smoke weed and/or cigarettes they don't care and won't do anything about it but offer to move you buildings but they're going to try and charge you a fee. If theres an extra person living in the unit and they run up your electricity bill they also don't care about that even if you tell them. The current person who's supposed to deal with any problems that roommates have with each other is Cassey and she does anything to avoid doing her job. She is also very rude and will just keep making excuses. When your lease ends they will prorate your last 2 months you live there and bill you it all at once but they don't tell you till half way through the last month you're living there. The people in the office hide many things and neglect to tell you many things just to get you to sign a lease. The younger people who work here tend to be really nice and try their best to be helpful but there needs to be a manager who will actually get things done and not push things off.</review>< Rating>

The office staff are unhelpful and unorganized, they never know what is going on, constant random charges and no understanding from management despite the fact that it is SUPPOSED to be meant for college students. (Not a group known for an amazing income that can afford extra, unexpected charges) Upper management is always changing and no one seems to know who is in charge. The last time I left a review I was in-office and was guilt-tripped for a better rating, but I’m tired of it. This is not what I expected when I signed my original lease, and when I resigned for another year (due to its amazing location) the problems only got worse. The saving grace for this place are the maintenance staff who are AMAZING- they are always friendly and try to find the least expensive way to fix anything that goes wrong in your apartment and are ALWAYS friendly and courteous. The star I gave is for them because they have earned it and deserve it.

*update* I was also threatened by my neighbor and their guests on the way to work last night, and when I reported it (despite the fact that management admitted to knowing about previous issues with these same people in other residencies) they told me there was nothing they could do. How about a stay away order so that the next time they do this the police can get rid of them on a trespassing violation?! These people were caught squatting in someone’s living room and were reported by multiple people for violent threats. This community DOES NOT care about the safety of its residents!!<//review>

<Review>The glen at University pkwy, where do I start... I’ve been living in this place since it had opened up, so like 3 years. I only stayed here because it offered fully furnished town homes with all the amenities, and was close to campus.
I faced so many issues at the glen regarding unexpected fees, noise, robberies, gun shots, and they even evacuated the whole place cuz someone had some military grade ordanance.
To be very honest this place is not that safe. I have moved out already and they are still charging  me for dumb reassignment fees which are over $600.
I don’t recommend this place just because of the management, and the issues you will face regarding them chasing after you for money or they will make you face “legal action”. I wish I could give negative stars.< /Review>< Gmap_id>

The management here is always helpful and willing to accommodate for any misfortunes that may take place! The front office staff are always on the ball when it comes to customer service, especially Chloe! Overall, my experience at The Glen has been a blast and I'm glad that I renewed to stay for another year!<//Review>

The place is beautiful to live and offers great plans and amenities. It is pricey but everything is included. Furniture, wifi, cable, etc. I have had difficulties with wifi troubles but the company they use is super helpful and has 24/7 service. However, in the past dealing with office was an absolute disaster. Old managers never attended to residence fast enough or would shrug off the problem, staff was never on the same page always telling residence one thing then another. But the new manager, Turner is by far the absolute best manager this place has ever had! I can see him bring this place to the full potential it has. He solved my problem as soon as we came in contact and you can tell the passion he has to bringing this place back up. They have come a log way for being brand new. Problems are guaranteed to show up being as new as it is, but if they keep Turner as the manager this place will be the best living around campus. Just please figure out a best guest parking and this place will be perfect! Thank you Turner for your fast and helpful service!
Very happy resident!</review>< gmap_id>

The Glen is a very great place to live! This upcoming fall will be my 3rd year living here and I haven't regretted renewing my lease here at The Glen! The CAs host a bunch of great events to make this community closer. I feel very safe and whenever I have a problem The Glen staff have always listened to me and helped me every way they can. Especially Gwendolyn Benitez! She is super helpful with any problem I have had and I've seen her be super helpful with everyone else. She always greets everyone with a huge smile and to me is very definition of customer service. The Glen is not just a place to live, it is a home.<//review>

Such a gorgeous place but thats about it, the rates are a joke and change like everyday. I was told complete lies regarding my parking when i signed my lease by two people that no longer work in the office and now i'm literally stuck and forced into paying for garage parking that i did not even request. Better yet i have to share the garage with someone extremely inconsiderate that takes up almost both spots which has lead me to damaging my car because i can hardly fit in it. I really wish the office staff were a little more considerate in helping their resident with their issues but that probably won't ever happen but besides that the place is gorgeous. Also i've had multiple issues with not being notified not even once when new roommates move in, I've came home to random people just inside my place without any prior notice. I was considering signing another year but fear doing so based on the customer service i have experienced here and the incentives always changing makes it really stressful to know when the right time is to sign.< /review>

Im only rating the maintenance as  5 stars. Honestly they do the best job at fixing anything in the apartments. They're super friendly and will help you out if you just talk to them  Pro Tip: If you manage to mess anything up in your place and you're freaking out, catch them outside and and let them know so they can give you their input before you call the office. The girls in the office are so awful and lazy . Except for Bree, she's cool (Chloe is cool too). But  as for the Glen, prepare to be in a place where there are a lot of freshmen who know nothing about adulting. They will annoy you, they will throw parties, get stupid drunk and throw up everywhere, they'll mess up the walls and break some chairs. Thankfully, however, maintenance is there to help.<//Review>

<review>Absolute nightmare. Dealing with thrashy kids throwing parties occasionally and security not doing anything about the volume and safety (under the influence). I would never recommend this place if you're looking to live and pursue your education over at CSUSB. Plus living with people in the same unit, who have no disregard for your belongings and safety is another highlight of my experience here. The overall maintenance team is good and with the management turning over a new leaf compared to older staffs that were absolutely inefficient and rude. Seriously consider your options before leasing up a place with the Glen.</review>< pictures>

STAY THE F#*@K AWAY FROM THIS PLACE

The staff is full of incompetent sales people (mostly students....). None of them can give you a straight answer as to what you are actually getting yourself into. And before you know it: your locked into a year long lease -- with the worst tenants....need I say more(?).

This place deserves negative 5 stars. Total piece of $h!+< /review>

<Review>This Place has many residents who are disrespectful of those they live around; they yell and play loud music and don't care what time of day it is when they openly choose to disturb the peace.  IT seems like these sorts of people are drunk, or high on drugs, or both.  No one in their right mind would act that way.  I will have to post some you tube videos, or just ask anyone that lives in the area.  The university already sent out neighborhood letters saying they have nothing to do with the Glenn.  It seems they don't want to take the blame for such a downgrade to the community, by allowing this loud, unruly element into the area.   Don't try to call the office and ask for security, they do nothing.  The place looks nice on the outside, but it is a dive, just because of their inability to screen who lives there.  It seems sad for everyone, except the people who have moved in and chosen to ruin it for everyone, and for the Glenn for apparently not screening who they let ruin it for everyone.< /Review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>{'time': 1508460431157, 'text': "Hello Rudd,\nThank you for writing us a review.

This place is horrible!!!!!!!!!! The people that work in the office are children uneducated and worthless. They ignore everyones issues and make u feel extremely unwanted. PARKING AND RATES ARE A RIP OFF AND A JOKE! SECURITY SUCKS! one week rates are like two hundred dollars cheaper and then the next they are extremely overpriced. BE CAREFUL WHEN U SIGN A LEASE BECAUSE THEY WILL LIE TO YOU ABOUT EVERYTHING JUST TO GET U TO SIGN!! this place makes over $4000/$5000 per month town home off a total of 6/7 people that they have crammed up living in one place. its ridiculous! you car will definitely get broken into AS MINE HAS BEEN BROKEN INTO so be WARNEDl this place is not safe. MY BIGGEST COMPLAINT IS THE STAFF IN THE OFFICE. maintenance people are cool but the leasing manager and community manager both have the worst attitudes and are never available. i live in the last row of units in the back and THERE WAS MOLD IN MY UNIT AND IT WAS IGNORED! AND RATS AND BATS in and outside my place. I have lived here for only a few months and i can't stand this place! DONT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID U WILL REGRET IT. once u sign ur lease its guarenteed  u will be ignored and disrespected by the office staff, get charged random fees and never sleep because the amount of noise. SERIOUSLY get a new staff team that actually wants to help their residents because thats what makes this place so horrible and awful. Don't waste ur money and regret it once its to late.</text>

I couldn't transfer because I had emergency surgery. They still wouldn't break my lease even though I would not be able to go live there. They are taking advantage of my situation to get money. They even have me locked out of my account for some reason. I would say stay away from this place.< /Text>

This place is really beautiful and nice just its unfair how they change the rates and give out deal right after you have been living here for a while.<//Text>

The townhomes are very nice. The bedrooms are spacious and the pool area/clubhouse is also great. However, though the Glen staff is nice, they are disorganized and do not care to inform their residents. When my roommate and I first moved in, they did not have a key fob ready for our apartment or mailbox. It took them almost two weeks to get the keys, and they did not update us on the progress unless we asked multiple times. Parking is a nightmare. If you do get a spot, you have to pay for it and it may be a distance away from your townhome. A few days ago, some men started drilling into our balcony for several hours (it was extremely loud and woke everyone up). They then left it unfinished and put some plastic material and duct tape over it. We were not informed that this was going to happen and when we addressed it with the Glen staff, they said "someone should have told you about it." They recently charged a fee on everybody's account, but did not inform us or explain it until we called. There is little communication. All in all, though the townhomes are nice and convenient, I would not choose to renew my lease.<//Text>

The management is terrible. You will probably be put into a filthy apartment, possibly pets even though they aren't allowed, and the management will take care of none of it. Prices are to high for the terrible experience.<//Text>

<review>I had an IPod tripod accident and my screen completely shattered. I am using this for my YouTube channel and work, so I was worried. It’s a tough time for everyone and I was very stressed. The very next day I found NextGen and they quickly offered to repair it same day with an appointment. Can’t get any better/faster service.  Clear pricing and services explained. Definitely would share my positive experience with my friends and family. Thank you guys.</review>< GmapID>

I was charged a little bit more than expected but Daniel called to make the situation better and even threw in a free screen protector for my other phone which is much appreciated. They are fast and efficient. If you have any issue, they will work it out to make sure the customer is satisfied, great. customer. service. Thank you.</review>

Came in to get my screen Replaced and specifically asked the guy About the quality of the screen that he’s giving me.
He said it was a decent screen it’s aftermarket it’s a good one.
That was not the case my screen lags/freezers/ and the 3D Touch does not work like I would expect it to.
since the first second I got it fixed
Came back to the shop to see what is there that we could do about it and he got really defensive and started saying stuff like I don’t care by your problems this is how it is.Came back to the shop to see what is there that we could do about it and he got really defensive and started saying stuff like I don’t care by your problems this is how it is
Was extremely rude.
People like that should not be in business.
I do not deserve public money
And I paid over $70 for this garbage.
Be cautious when looking for His service< /review><pics>None</pics>< response>

Do not waste your time here. I called on april 1rst for a quote on my tablet. He said he would fix my tablet for 55. Two days later i called again but he told me he was going to charge me 65. I asked him why he increased the price  if he told me it was 55. He said maybe  i spoke to someone else. But, i remember his voice and it was him.  But, he end up giving me a "discount" I took my tablet on a Saturday to reset it since it didnt let me reset it. He said to pick it up on monday. I called monday at 3pm he did not had it ready. I called Tuesday and same thing. Wednesday too. On Wednesday i told him i really needed my tablet to do my online test from school.  He said he would have it ready before 2. At 2 He told me he tried to fix it but he couldn't. I end up taking it home but way worse. When i turned it on all it says is the brand of the tablet.   Now i have to buy another tablet.  This is a waste of time to be honest.  Besides all this, he gives you a bad attitude.  He is not professional.  I do not usually give bad reviews but this one definitely was a bad experience.< /Text>

Cracked screen on my Mexico Telcel A70. Phone was very new, took them a week to get a new screen, cost of screen 100 dllrs. They replaced it in less then a hour, labor cost 70 dllrs. This was still cheaper then buying a new phone. Nice, friendly people.< /Text>

Alyssa is the best technician hands down ! Her customer service is truly the best. She is very thorough with her work.

The team at nextgen wireless always goes above and beyond to help me with any repair and I will definitely recommend nextgen to anyone I know who needs any cellphone or tablet repair .

I brought in my Samsung note 3 that kept power cycling and I really needed pictures and videos to be taken out. She  was actually able to get the phone back to a working phone and also extracted the photos and
videos for me ! :-)< /Review>

<review>Brought my cell phone in to have the cracked screen replaced.  When it was replaced, it wasn't completely set and I was told that it would settle into place and if it didn't to just bring it back and they would take care of it.  I brought it back because the bottom of the touch screen was unusable and I was told that I'd have to pay to have it repaired.</review></record>

Just got confirmation that my ipad was succefully repaired!

Couldn't have asked for a better experience.

Convenient location next to my favorite brewery tasting bar!

Dropped off my ipad for repair had two brews across the street came back & it was finished.

David is a wiz!<//Review>

Any fool can fix an iphone.  It takes a pro to dig down and fix what others won't or can't.

My wife has a Moto G4 that she is very happy with.  She fell and the phone took the brunt of the fall resulting in a cracked screen.  Called several highly rated repair shops and no one would touch the Moto G4.  Called Nextgen with no real hope of getting the phone fixed.  Spoke with Danny.  Had to wait about 30 seconds while he checked availability for the screen.  Comes back and tells me he can do it for $95 but I have to wait 3 days for the part to come in.  I was happy as a pig in poop; none of the other highly rated shops would even touch it.  All this was on Thursday.

As promised got called on Monday and picked up the phone in the afternoon.  Phone looks new and works great.  Very, very happy with the entire experience.</Text>

Nexgen Wireless IS the place. Daniel got my work cell phone up and running. The screen was totally shattered the part that was sent was incorrect and i needed that phone ASAP! DANIEL , went above and beyond with his resources to make it happen.  The man stayed 1hr and half after business hours and called me and got the job done.< /Text>

< Review>
First impression: boxes and boxes of shoes...little directives
Staff: needs work
Prices: not off the charts high, but not really that good either
Clearance area: really, why did you bother?
Selection: Good, seem to have the “regular”sizes, not like size 7, and size 13
Places to sit down to try on shoes? F
Maybe ill return, can’t really recommend yet. Obviously, others feel the same. Store was empty, not a good sign.

Sick spot and they even have this spin the wheel game after you've purchased a cool pair of sneakers I definitely recommend this spot do feel like they need to step on the shoe game on the kids rack tho but other than that it's very impressive and fun .<//Review>

< Review>
I had the Beef and Lamb Shawarma. It was delicious and the flavors pop in your mouth. A great blend of seasonings and texture. I highly recommending eating here. I also had the dessert ; malabi with pistachio crumble with a sweet rose water syrup; it was very unique but tasty. Then the Red Infusion is a delightful hibiscus tea with a limeade. Very refreshing.<//Review>

<review>If you’re looking for the best hummus and falafel plates in the area, this is your spot. My favorite is the sabich plate with hard-boiled egg and the best eggplant. Their food is organic and they have great desserts and drinks, too.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Watch out for COVID and food poisoning! Staff does not wash hands. No masks. No gloves. No attempt for food safety, even if it wasn’t a pandemic the staff acts like they have no concern for our health and safety. We used to enjoy this place but it seems like the employees no longer care. We had to return our food and walk out.</Text>

People still have to go inside to order and most wait in that small enclosed space. We ate outside. But they had no lights on and didn't seem to care either. It was not even close to closing hour either.  Almost like they didn't want people there eating at the outdoor space in the tents.  Food was tasty. But the menu item i ordered never said tomatoes and cucumbers and I then picked them all out.  I don't like to waste food but it was not written under the ingredients of the item. My vegetarian friend liked it.<//text>

The food was good but many other things were wrong. Health concerns.

It pains me to give a bad review but I hope it helps the business do better next time.
First of all I work in food service, I was out of work for a long time due to COVID-19 and it was hard finding a new job I lost a lot of income this year so my review has no political background.
I was excited to see this type of food and was eager to try it, I saw the tables outside with some deliciously looking plates so I had to try it.

My wife ordered and I went in to pick up the order, as I waited for the order I noticed how the person on the line plating the food was not wearing gloves, according to the California food code contact with ready to eat food (won't have any further preparation to be eaten) should be done with disposable gloves. Its the kind of stuff health inspectors fine during inspections.
The cashier who was handling cash from the tip jar jumped in to help plating the orders not wearing gloves, more importantly not washing his hands before touching the food. One of the cooks was opening some bags of condiments with his teeth.
None in the kitchen was wearing a face mask except the cashier.
I know the mask is uncomfortable in a hot kitchen by own experience, but its a reality we have to face for a few more months.
A close friend lost his father to COVID, a high-school classmate also died recently to the virus.

I didn't enjoy my food wondering if this was safe to eat or not.< /Text>

<Text>I cannot speak higher of the food we got today. My wife and I came in for a shared plate for lunch and ended up with several to take home for dinner. I’ve been cooking for 17 years many with French/ Mediterranean influences. We live about an hour away and this will be a treat for us for as long as we can get it. Amazing well composed plates. Great outdoor seating. Thank you so much.< /Text>< Date>

Absolutely fantastic and completely dairy free! Loads of vegan and meat options (kosher-style) and all the veggies and salads you can imagine. A bit pricey for lunch but incredible quality. They catered my son's bar mitzvah and it was fantastic and the guests raved. So grateful to have them in our community serving up healthy fare!</Review>

Was about to walk in to order some food (while wearing  a mask) and I see inside that non of the workers are wearing a mask 🤷‍♀️🤔 or one women in the kitchen had hers falling off her ear.
we tried their food once and it was good and the service was great too! Although hummus was cold which is bad .
I really don’t know is it’s a Grass Valley thing but during this pandemic I don’t want to risk myself by eating in places that don’t take the means to protect their workers and customers. Sorry for 3 starts</text>

<review>I was so happy when an organic vegetarian friendly restaurant opened in our town and was a regular customer.  However, now that they are actively resisting the protocols meant to protect our community from COVID, i will never set foot in the restaurant again.  When this first happened, I couldn't believe it.  I went to talk to one of the owners who actually shared his misguided belief that using sanitizer of food contact surfaces and dishes causes sickness.<//review><user_name>Chris Skjellyfetti<//user_name><response>None< /response></record>

Had the chicken shawarma plate, delicious!
Also they seemed to have modified the mask policy since last review- everyone in the kitchen was wearing one.

Very good place to eat, it has good quality food and vegan options too. Eco friendly packaging and good drinks and desserts. One of the best falafels I’ve ever tried.

I ordered a beef + lamb shawarma plate and it’s the size of a small salad. Where do these prices come from? I understand it’s Covid but there are so many better places to spend your money with better quality, friendlier employees. Majorly bummed. If you do order here make sure to get a chicken shawarma, not the “plate.” Feeling disillusioned and deceived<//Review>< username>

<Text>The food is good, but the last three times I went the service wasn't poor. Either they didn't answer the phone, or I was placed on a long hold while trying to make a to go order. To
make matters worse, on my last visit I got some tortilla-like flat burnt bread instead of the usual pita bread for dipping. It also seemed like some of the folks working there weren't getting along.<//Text>< name>

We are doing our best to keep both  customers  and our employees happy, but some days things go differently...We are working on doing an online ordering system and then it will be much easier for all.  Our phone system is not ideal and during rush hours it is not our priority, though we try to do our best. We are still a small family business and not a corporate machine...It has its plus and minuses :) Regarding the pita - its sounds like you got the Gluten Free wrap. We do not make our own GF pitas. ( is that  what you asked for?).\nHope next time you come in, things will feel better! Cheers.'}<//Resp>

I love the vibe of this restaurant - this was much needed in downtown Grass Valley.  Staff was helpful, love open kitchens where you can watch your food being prepared!  Their vegan Key Lime Pie was amazing... hummus was delicious, and their presentation was unique.  I hope they can expand... seating outside... but with the space they have, it is smartly arranged and comfortable.</Text>

<rating>4</rating><Review>I discovered Meze at an event at the North Colombia School House before Meze opened down town. I was impressed with the quality and freshness of the food, as well as the authenticity and flavor of my  Falafel Plate. Service was friendly and prompt.
When Meze opened I was one of the first customers and enjoyed my beef and lamb gyro, with hot sauce. No complaints, although I thought the price tag of around $14 for a gyro seemed high, despite that the ingredients are claimed to be organic. I have tried and love the Vegan Bowl as well ( even though Im far from Vegan ).
The only complaint that I have is the tables are often dirty with food from the last person who sat there. I asked for the table to be cleaned once and the woman behind the counter begrudgingly came out and wiped the table, knocking food bits on to the floor, and my lap to my dismay. The table still had a layer of black grime that I had to wipe off with a paper napkin so that I could feel good about eating off the table. The bathroom trash is often over flowing, and there has been empty soap dispenser in the bathroom.
Overall, the food is very good, the front end could be more friendly , but I like this place and would and do continue to frequent this establishment. Glad you are here in our community. Give thanks!!<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Raw vegan desserts without cane sugar that are sweetened with maple syrup. We had a really yummy key lime pie. The portions could be larger.

Fresh yummy food you found the place.  They are new and really getting it going. We did lunch here and the ambiance is lively and warm.  The place is small so to go could be a good option.
I would say that for the price and serving size it is proper.  They are doing mostly organic and definitely have there recipes down
I hope Meze all the success and plan to eat here often</text>

<review>Amazing-ness in a pita!
The love is felt in every bite as well as in the service and pleasant vibe that has been orchestrated in detail to deliver an extraordinary experience.
A really important part to me is the fact that the pita bread is freshly made on site every day and that the produce is sourced consciously, is Organic and it is definitely felt and tasted.
One of my favorites are the INCREDIBLE DESERTS! Sooo delicious!  Also try out the salad platters which they are so famous for.
All in all really good food that brings you the colorful Mediterranean breeze and stimulates your taste buds in a way that you haven't experienced before! Definitely give it a try if you haven't yet!
Truly worth every penny 👍🏽
Enjoy!!!</review>< pics>

The food is good, but I observed some major sanitary contamination issues. I watched what seemed like the owner making the Moroccan carrots pop one in his mouth with bare hands and go directly back to mixing food. I said something to him he said thanks. 10 minutes later I watched as he was eating in the back and walk back to the line and grab food with a bare hand to take back to his plate. Doesn’t seem too conscious to me...</text>

<Text>The environment was great and people were friendly. Now here is the “however”... I ordered the chicken shawarma pita, the full size one. The top 1/4 of the sandwich had very tasty chicken and the other 3/4 was some sort of a salad with no taste. I would have rather ate the stack of napkins next the sandwich. I only had the pita and a “shot” of water for over 14 dollars! Walked out hungry, but as we left we saw a huge line. So apparently a lot of people like the place. The other person I was there with kinda enjoyed the meal but also left hungry. They played one song while we were there, and that was kinda weird. After the song was over, it was just ambient noise again.

I think this is your place if you are trying to be edgy or conscious and progressive. You can then tell your Ugg wearing social media trend setters that you ate there for a few likes. A couple selfies in the downtown setting and you have a Facebook story. But if your hungry, go somewhere else.</Text><time>1572990821506<//time>< Pics>

<Text>I am a bit biased, so take this with a grain of salt.

If you are in to this sort of food, then sure it might be awesome. Not my cup of tea personally, so I will move on.

The prices. Wow. This place is outrageous expensive. Maybe that is the going rate for hippy food, not sure. Either way, I won't be back.< /Text>< UserId.>

I waited excitedly for them to open a brick and mortar store, after having their delicious food many times at local events.  This is authentic middle eastern food with amazing flavors, sauces and pickled veggies.  My favorite dish right now is the Paleo bowl, since I usually eat low-carb.< /Text>

<text>This place is what Grass Valley has been missing. Super fresh, organic, delicious, healthy and happy food. The Paleo bowl and Falafel Plate we're delicious, teramisu amazing, minestrone warmed the soul and the chai was just right!
Highly recommend this place if you are looking for affordable quality food cooked and prepared with love :)< /text></record>

Very disappointing. Pita sandwich was so juicy the bread fell apart in my hand, on the first attempted bite.

The eggplant was so chewy, I was forced to take it out of my mouth and set it on a napkin.

No plates, just a piece of paper stuck to the table from the juices running out of the 1/4 sized pita sandwich.

The falafel was tasty, the size of a quarter.

It was like ordering food off the Del Taco dollar menu, at 8 times the cost.

We often eat out, Meze is the worst we have had in a very long time.</text>

Really new and different food for Grass Valley, MeZe offers Israeli/middle eastern food in a casual environment.   Typical menu items are in the range of $15 .  You can order pitas sandwiches or plates, which feature meat or falafel, for example,  with small servings of salads and dressings.   I've had both a sandwich and a falafel plate.  I enjoyed both, but the falafel was just a touch over crisp and dry.  Still good if dipped in sauce!
Food is ordered at the register, and your name is called when it's ready.  Someone needs to explain to me why a tip is suggested by the cash register software.  Since when do cashiers get tips?  Also, the cashier is responsible for the phone, which means divided attention.   Have someone else do the take out orders!
Seating is quite limited in this small eatery...less than 6 small tables and a counter.  Nowhere is comfort a consideration...the chairs are functional but do not encourage lingering!
The service can be kind of strange.  Pita sandwich halfs are served on a rack, oddly lodged into coffee filters.  That's just wierd, and not actually very effective for drippy hand held food like this.  Hopefully they will plow some of their profits into a better service solution!
Overall, this is  worthwhile place.  The prime mission of a restaurant is to serve good food, and MeZe does that.  It's fresh, made from scratch, unusual flavors, and plenty of vegetarian options.  The price is reasonable.  It's not  a comfy hang out dinner place, for sure, but for a quick tasty and healthy dinner, it is great.  And I bet the peripheral details will improve as they are in business longer.< /Text>

This is my preferred grocery store in the area.  It's a little out of the way for me, but when someone says "groceries", this is almost always my choice.  It's very nice inside, the customer service has always been on point.  They have a full Pharmacy.</text>

<review>Ive shopped there many times before due to its closeness to my place. This time was unacceptable and I truly hope to see improvement in my next visits otherwise I might have to consider the one on magnolia to get some BETTER service and some DECENT store cleanliness. It was overall a horrid  experience and i expected better response from the higher staff. I waited 30 mins to see manager and when finally attended she was unbelievably rude and dazed.

Might have to reconsider going here again.</review>< gmap_id>

It is just a good Vons, friendly and open late most nights. Self check-out as long as you are not buying alcohol. Fresh veggies and meat, good deli and delivery if needed and so super affordable as well you may stop shopping for yourself.< /text>

Clean store and not usually busy. Prices are a bit high but the quality of products are generally better to. 4 stars because it's frustrating to have to get a vons card every time I check out, and I refuse to sign up for one.</Text>

< review>
This is a really nice, clean store. I just moved to the area so I'm trying out every grocer within a half hour drive. There was a great selection of most things but my only hesitation is that there wasn't a huge selection of produce, acceptable but not amazing.  Maybe I'm mistaken but I think Vons are the same as Safeway and I know at Safeways the produce section can vary a lot by location.  The other thing I would like more selection of in an ideal world would be imports.  The international foods were very very limited. Everything they do carry was well stocked when I was there (Tuesday arvo) except a couple things people are still panic buying which is understandable. I appreciated too that there was a public toilet during covid times, a lot of places have them closed.</review>

Always very clean. Priced a bit higher than the Walmart next door, but fresh produce and meat are much better quality and worth the added cost. Great pharmacy with familiar faces, and always friendly. Lots of deals on water and gorgeous flowers.</review>

< Review>
I had only gone in for Arizona Rx Stress tea ( which they didn't have). I was all over the store trying to find it. I finally found where they had tea, it was way in the back ,behind cleaning supplies and detergents. I didn't find this a logical place for it.
But other then that it's a very neat, clean and bright store.
If you like flowers and plant arrangements, They had a beautiful array to choose from.
Could have had a little better customer service<//Review>

<review>We visited this store simply because it was on our way home from another location, but we were very disappointed. The produce section was under stocked. We buy mostly organic and needed a squash, but there was only 1 squash left which didn't look too good, so we didn't get it. There were also several spots for Taylor Farms pre-packaged salads, but most were empty. Stock was low on several other items as well.

At our local Albertsons, the bakery department gives free cookies to the kids. We went to the bakery department here to see if they do the same, and there was one worker busy helping somebody else. We waited about 10 minutes and finally gave up. The employee was still helping the first customer, never acknowledged us (I think her back was to us and the other customer the whole time), and no other employees showed up to help out. When we left, 2 more customers had lined up behind us.

We also avoided purchasing several dairy items because they felt too warm to the touch. I would compare it to taking something out of your fridge and letting it sit on the counter at least 1 hour. Even items toward the back felt warm. I looked around for a thermometer to check the temperature, but there weren't any that I could see.<//review>< pics>

<Text>Their digital coupons rarely work. You will get ripped off more often then not. Keep a sharp eye out of you think you will actually save money with their awful app. I highly recommend a different grocery store chain that doesn't require digital coupons to save money.<//Text>< pictures>

<pictures>None< /pictures><Review>Floral department was very rude and not helpful at all. Their customer service sucks!  I believe the lady was named Robin. Not sure if she was floral manager or what. So I went to get balloons blown up and not even that long after, they were all on the ground so I went back and nicely asked if they could give me new ones or refund me since I got a big Bouquet of balloons for like $20 for my b -day party. She was like no we can’t do anything for you with attitude and was rude to me didn’t even say sorry or do anything to help resolve the issue. So after I asked multiple times what can she do for me it’s my b-day and I’d like to have some balloons today, she finally said I’ll give you two new balloons (out of like 12 that I had) and told the other lady to do it and then just walked away. The other lady was nice and apologized wished me a happy birthday and gave me an extra balloon with the two balloons. I Didn’t get her name, but she was polite to me. Anyways overall, I was not happy with this Vons and I’ve been shopping their for a long time. Don’t think I will be anymore. Waste of money on balloons and an inconvenience to have to go back for nothing!</Review>< Time>

People are nice, store is clean but too many time I have been walking in while someone is pulling a beer run and they go flying out the door. Almost been hit a couple of times by this. The store just let's them get away with it. Cashiers dont even flinch as kids run past with 2 twelve packs of beer in there hands.</review>

<Review>Usually it's great,  but today they were a little off. I took the last of the bagged salads. And the carry carts weren't right by the door where they usually are, so I had to ask and then go search. And then I got rushed out of line. I had to go over to a other checkout counter to put my wallet away and stuff. So today may have been an off day for them.< /Review>< Pictures>

<review>Why do i need to apply for a free Vons member card to get the deals on the soda tags. This makes no sense. Im buying more than the required amount you should be happy i want purchase from you. Your not saving me any money. If you gave me an incentive with the membership & the purchase that makes more sense but if you know im a new customer & you see im buying more than 4 bottles you shouldnt give me a hard time to sign up for a card when its free & doing so im still getting them at the same advertised price. Does this make sense?< /review>< Pictures>

Very disgusting customer service. John is very unprofessional, sarcastic, and rude! Brianna is loud, unprofessional, and rude. They are horrible store directors and the store is never clean. Trust me you'll find better service at Stater Brothers and the store doesn't look trash there< /Text>

< Review>
Ran to the store for a pizza for my kid meanwhile I decided to grab laundry soap while I was there 2 birds 1 stone kinda deal...
I was in the store maybe 5 min & I m guessing due to the huge sweatshirt I had on the manager was following me completely obvious...
I was actually offended
I wouldnt go back to this location again just for that reason alone< /Review>

Kinda irritated with them today...as a customer I feel like if I call a store and ask if something is in stock, they should actually look...they didnt and told me they no longer carry something....low and behold i end up making the trip anyway and while looking for a replacement,  i find what I actually needed smh....< /review>

It’s well stocked, it’s clean but.... the employees could use some training on “friendliness”.  I wanted to purchase an item that was not priced, I walked to an employee and asked if I could get a price on it.  The employee could not hide her disgust because she had to “check” for the price on a register, I asked if I could pay for the item with her and she quickly said No because she was not logged on?!!  She had just checked for the price!   Anyway, I thanked her, to which there was no reply.  I walked to another register, waited for my turn and once it was my turn to pay, the cashier scanned the item and said how much it was... she never greeted me and onced i payed she simply gave me my receipt and never said “thank you, have a nice day or thanks for coming in”. Why should I return to a merchant that does not appreciate my business. I rather drive to a further market, as long as I get the proper service and feel welcome.

Mr. Vons you need to do an Undercover Boss at this store!!!!<//text>

I seriously can't describe how much I hate shopping here. There is no staff in the butcher's area, one rude pharmacist, and maybe two checkout lines open if you're lucky.

Just go up the street to Albertsons, same products, same price, far better staff.< /Review>

This store is extremely unorganized and very under-staffed. There’s is always a long checkout line. When you can’t find items in their poorly organized store good luck to you because there is no one around to help!</review>

I ordered a cake for a coworker on a Saturday. They stated I only needed 24 hr notice so I asked if it could be ready for Monday night. They said no because they didn't have a decorator on Mondays. Ok that's fine then I'll pick it up on Tuesday night. I asked for a picture on the cake like their display and they said they could do it if I brought in the picture. Which I did, a 5x7 to be exact. I show up Tuesday night only to find out they never made my cake. I was told that the order was placed to the side and must have been forgotten. The worker was very apologetic and stated her manager would reach out to me. The next morning I go back in to speak to the manager who told me they would make the cake if I still wanted it for another day at no charge. I thought that was really nice so I said ok and we scheduled it for Friday night (last night). I show up to pick up the cake around 10pm. I could not believe what was handed to me. Not only was the cake not what I ordered but it was made very poorly. The image I had provided was supposed to be across the entire top of the cake just like their display. The image on my cake was smaller than the picture I had provided!!! There was so much blank space all around the picture!!! It looked awful. And is if that was not enough, the screen printed message was tilted and not at all centered. It looked a mess. Unfortunately there was no I could talk to about it because it was after hours. I took the cake and brought it home. I couldn't even give it to my coworker, I was too embarrassed. I wish I would have taken a picture of the cake so you could see what a disaster it was. I would have much rather paid for a cake elsewhere if I knew they were going to waste my time like that.

<Text>Terrible Store.  I only go there because it's the closest and I dread it every time.  When you call, no one ever answers! You are on hold forever and the phone just keeps returning back to the main menu. It doesn't matter what time of day you call.  It's faster to drive down the store and ask the question in person!  It seems someone needs to know how to order better as a lot of the products have expired dates on them.<//Text>< Pics>

Rip off!!! This store is a money pit. Most of the time they also gave rotten produce. Thanks for the years of RIP off but your bread is good. So basically lower your prices and you don't have to sell rotten vegetables... Also most of your meat sucks.< /text>

Great employees , will help with no problem and store is always clean! Rude customers however run rampant in this store ! Buying groceries at Vons doesn't give you the right to be a stuck up dick to the employees ! So if that is you, take a breathe and maybe go to another store where your rude behavior is acceptable .</Review>

Came in at 12:45. Deli completely understaffed.  Waited almost 20 mins to get helped. 3 of the 4 hot soups were empty and there were no plastic spoons available. The manager needs to be terminated.<//review>

VONS is great!!....if you become a member, you really get some awesome benefits.ONLY complaint is the meats...for that we make a special trip to RALPH'S especially because they carry BOAR'S HEAD in their deli. ......cmon VONS, nobody else carries Boars Head deli meat.....you need to start!</text>

VONS is great!!....if you become a member, you really get some awesome benefits.ONLY complaint is the meats...for that we make a special trip to RALPH'S especially because they carry BOAR'S HEAD in their deli. ......cmon VONS, nobody else carries Boars Head deli meat.....you need to start!< /review>
