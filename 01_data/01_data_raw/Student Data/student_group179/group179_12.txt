Very clean salon, they do great work but does get a lil busy. May have to wait even with an appointment because there's only 2 ladies working most of the time.</text>

<Text>This place is so good. They corrected a major horrible mail experience I had at jades nails on sunset and San Juan Ave. the lady was so nice, she even gave me a 10 bucks discount for my troubling day I had the day before. So not only did she fix my nails and feet. She even tried to make me feel better by giving me a discount to cover a horrible experience I had prior to her. My nails were super neat and beautiful. The place was clean and I didn’t feel uncomfortable while there. She even allowed my two girls to set there feet in water while getting a basic pedicure.  Y daughter and I are returning today to get our nails done by the best.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

I walked in to the salon and asked them to remove my gel polish due to my time restriction  with agreement that i would come back in 1 hour and get full set done.
RESULTS: she removed my gel polish in 10 minor less, did not trim or file my nails, left me looking like  a zombie and when i went to register it was $11.  While behind her written REMOVAL $5.
So i asked why i am being charge more then a double there was no answer. So i clearly never came back to do the full set.< /Text>

I think I just had the best pedicure. I'm new to the area so I googled nearest salon. I got right in and Loan took care of me. She was very thorough ... Really took her time. I will definitely go back to see her.<//review>

<review>Interesting establishment. They claim they accept walk-ins which I was but I was turned away because they had previous appointments that actually weren't at their shop at the time. It's too bad they treat people this way. I have no problem taking my tips and my business elsewhere good luck to this establishment.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

When I called to set an appointment I was told it was $30 for a new set of gel nails. When i go to pay i found out i was charged $5 for french tips & $5 for a gold line! My sister was charged $10 for just the coffin shape! Neither of us was told this until after we paid! When we said it wasnt the price we were quoted the lady said she knew she didnt tell us! Are you kidding? Plus, as I'm sitting there another customer walks in for an appointment & the nail tech begins ARGUING with her that she didnt make it with that store. Then insisted the customer show her call log on her phone to PROVE she called them! Seriously?! Needless to say, I will not be returning<//text>

< Review>
The food here is amazing! I've tried the beef stew and highly recommend it..the beef really melts in your mouth and falls apart...its heavenly. The grilled salmon with fried rice in garlic butter sauce is wonderful...salmon is good, and the rice is amazing. My husband tried the filet mignon is very tender and comes with a really savory butter herb topping and nice sides. All in all the portions are very generous and the food well presented and DELICIOUS.  Everyone in our group was very impressed and very full upon leaving! The staff is polite and the ambiance is beautiful and clean. This place is new and the owners take feedback to improve very well. I think that the restaurant has been pretty popular and seen some rush hours where they were a bit understaffed which is why some other reviewers were dissatisfied...but I'm guessing first month growing pains that management will address. Even more than the restaurant itself...the staff and management is very solid and attentative and I imagine it will only get better from here. Highly recommend!

On another note, the sandwich takeaway area just opened this week and the bread they bake is one of the best I've had. I got to talk to some of the staff and they mentioned that they try to use as many natural products and forgo harmful chemicals in their bread making process. The bread has a slightly different texture than other bakeries in the area, but tastes WAAAY better in my opinion. It more authentic French baguette style than the spongier Vietnamese style bread.

I also found that if the sandwich takeaway area is closed, you can still go into the restaurant side to order things that are already made, from the sandwich side.

Edit: We came back again and ordered the beef stew (again) and the halibut...omg if you like butter this is halibut is to die for...I gotta know how they make it taste like that! My husband ordered it and I ate more than half his plate haha. The beef stew was delicious and slightly different than the first time I ordered it...it was definitely better this time around. It's great to know they're constantly improving their dishes.< /Review>

This place is new and hasn't gotten too much action but I hope they keep up the good work and the good food and hopefully things will turn around for them. I am all about small mom-and-pop businesses. God bless and best of luck! Cix< /Review>

One of the nicest Vietnamese restaurants I've been to. I had the grilled pork with vermicelli and eggrolls. I love it that their menu has pictures,  😄 helps me decide better. The place is clean and the staff are really nice and helpful.<//text>

Bun bo is delicious but the waiters need training on how to greet and invite guests.  They just sat there and didn't say a word until you walk in, awkwardly look around to see if you are welcomed, sit down, then they came with menu.  Train the staff please!< /Text>

This restaurant needs to have some quality control or it will close soon.  Beef stew was very tough and almost unedible.  Either the restaurant should take this off the menu if they don't like to invest the time to cook the meat, but charging $9 for beef stew with this terrible quality makes no sense.</Review>

<text>The service was bad . I came in for diner and was seated . About 10 min. gone by and waiters walked by my table but never asked us for the order. Finally after the 10 min, we walked out . I wouldn't recommend the restaurant for any one.</text></record>

They did amazing work putting my wedding band and e-ring together. It was not an easy job but they did it perfectly and at a very reasonable price. I’ve only been in a few times but I’m impressed with the service and with the prices. I would highly recommend.<//text>

AMAZING customer service. My wedding ring set looks as good as the day my husband gave it to me 18 years ago. An honest, kind, fair business - something very rare these days. Thank you so much!<//review>

I have had such a great experience with each representative at Jewelry To Go! Each person was nice and friendly and very informative! I fell in love with a certain ring about 5 months ago but couldn't afford it at the moment so I would go back and revisit my dream ring occasionally. Recently, the store had called me because they were having a huge sale and knew i had been wanting that ring. Need I say more?! I bought the ring! Thank you so much for making my dream ring come true Jewelry To Go personnel!!!</text>

I brought in my boyfriend’s grandfather’s ring that had been broken for over 20 years. I wasn’t sure they would be able to fix it. The staff at Jewelry to Go went above and beyond. The repair looks wonderful, and it was the perfect Christmas gift. Thank-you for your professionalism and excellent customer service.<//text>

< Review>
I had some custom engraving done on some leatherette bracelets for a conference, the price was resonable and the product came out better than I expected.
I also had some rings resized, one was platinum and the others sterling silver. Ring sizing was excellent and very reasonable.
I would recommend Jewelry to Go in the future to my friends and family. Their staff was very friendly and knowledgeable.<//Review>

I was worried because of how much it would cost coming from a real jewelry shop. I started looking around, and told the nice lady who helped me, what kind of budget I had and she began to show me some unique pieces. She asked about my wife's skin tones so she could find something that would look good. We found a really nice pendant that I immediately knew my wife would love. We picked out a matching chain, and started checking out. Knowing that it was my wife's birthday, the nice lady wrapped up the pendant and put it in a gift bag for me. What really surprised me was when they also had a selection of cards to go with it. Not only did I not break the bank, I got something my wife loved, and I saved time because this store had everything I needed. Thank You Jewelry To Go for the great service, a unique/beautiful selection, and that perfect smile from my wife.<//Text>< Pics>

This is a very friendly family run business. They will spend time with you to make sure you are satisfied with your visit, but there is never any pressure to buy.  They will clean your jewelry for free each and every time you come in, even if it just to "look".  They have a great selection in store and will help you design your own piece.  Great customer service - always pleasant and friendly.</Review>

<Review>I just picked up a custom piece of jewelry, that I had made. I totally love it and plan to continue going here for the rest of my custom ideas! I've also had repair work done and both times my pieces came back looking better than they did before they broke! Couldn't be happier. Everyone who assisted me was incredibly nice and very helpful.< /Review><userid>105388750749133411504</userid></record>

<text>I have had nothing but great experience with this jewelry store. All the employees are very attentive and helpful and always welcome you with a smile. I have had rings, watches, and bracelets sized with them and they were prompt and did a great job. They also offer financing which is great. They have a wide selection and if you do not find what you are looking for in their inventory they do their best to help you find it. I have walked away from there with many fine peices of jewelry for great prices. I recommend this store to everyone.</text>< pics>

The post of one of my favorite earrings, a special gift from several years ago, snapped away from the main part of the earring.  The staff at Jewelry to go was able to repair it at a reasonable price in a reasonable amount of time.  In addition, while I browsed the store for items to put on my "wish list", they checked the prongs on my wedding set and cleaned it for free. It was a very pleasurable shopping expereince, and I will shop there again in the near future.</text>

Jewelry-To-Go sparkles like no other! Don't waste your time driving out of town when you can get friendly service and a quality selection right here. I went in to look at rings,  and right away was greeted by friendly faces, amazing prices, and diamonds that glitter brighter than any I've ever seen. Don't take my word for it, stop by, you must see for yourself!<//Text>

Loved the ring but unfortunately someone stole it husband got it back some how and it needed to be fixed well long story short he replaced it with a chipped stone he did which I'm not happy about after telling him how I was attached to my wedding ring he did give me a stone after originally losing my center stone with a thin also chipped opal seemed like it wasn't an accident that my good opal ended up "missing" it still to this day upsets me and this was back in 2010 they are definitely greedy in my opinion but what can ya do!<//Text>

<Review>I've posted a review several times in the past (February and March!) and it keeps disappearing! But I love this place enough to come back and try again.

After a really rough breakup, my friends encouraged me to head in and trade in some old jewelry from my past relationship. Al, Mary, and Angela were there to encourage me, reminding me about Jeremiah 29:11--that God had a plan for me. They also helped me find a tangible reminder--a watermelon tourmaline ring that signified the hope I had for a great future. It was a symbolic moment, trading in the old for the new.

Later, when this great future was being realized, my future husband and I went into Jewelry to Go to check out engagement rings and wedding sets. With many diverse options to choose from, an engagement ring and wedding band stuck out right from the beginning. It was gorgeous! There was only one thing--I didn't absolutely love the round center stone.

Unbeknownst to me, my future fiance went back into Jewelry to Go to discuss changing the diamond. After much research, he told them he wanted an asscher cut diamond. Because they didn't have the perfect diamond in their store, they offered to look for the right diamond while they were out of the country for a jewelry show. My diamond was handpicked and brought back from another country just to fit in my beautiful ring. Not only did they go out of their way to find the perfect diamond, they also were able to quickly change the diamonds in the ring. They also worked with my husband to figure out finances.

My husband proposed the night he picked it up because he was so excited for me to see the beautiful ring Jewelry to Go had created. Guess what!? I said yes!

My ring is stunning and I get compliments everywhere we go! I also have Pandora beads for each of the big events that have happened since. Jewelry to Go has found a place in our family as our family jeweler. We are so thankful for a jewelry store that can be a part of each momentous occasion that comes in our future.

Thanks, Al, Mary, Angela, and staff!!</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

I understand the markup on jewelry is huge, but this guys business practice is such that he protects his assests at any cost to yours. I would recommed Adams Jewelry that's right across the street.

<time>1358312717545</time><rating>5< /rating><review>Where can i start other then the quality of there jewelry is absolutely amazing!!! I never knew that buying jewelry from kmart or Wal-Mart was different until i first shopped at this store at 14 years old when my dad took me to pick out a ring, i am now 30 years old and still shopping here not only because i love the girls that work here but because Angela ( store manger) helped me create and design the most beautiful wedding ring I've ever seen ( btw everyone that has ever seen it has not only said this but also offered me well over retail value for it)!!! They also give back to the community and are always donating and helping when needed and i think this is worth more then anything when you live in a small town. Anyone looking for a special gift should absolutely go in and talk to Angela or Mary you won't be sorry</review>< Pictures>

I took my rather expensive Tissot Swiss watch in to Jewelry to Go to have the sapphire crystal replaced.  The jeweler quoted me over $200 to replace the crystal, which is a job the Tissot factory charges $45 for (it takes up to 7 weeks to get your watch back though) so rather than spend 7 weeks without my watch, I opted to use Jewelry to Go.

When I got my watch back, it was missing one of the retaining bands.  The jeweler said that he had lost it during the repair, but assured me that he would find it and call me (this was nearly 3 months ago and he hasn't called).

While I was waiting for him to find the band, I looked through the store at some of the loose diamonds.  The jeweler came back out and showed me a couple of very overpriced diamonds (example: 1 carat diamond of average color and clarity he wanted $10,000 for) and one of them he took out of the plastic sleeve and handed to me.  I looked at the diamond and then turned the packaging over to see the specifics and the price.  Because he had removed the plastic sleeve, the diamond fell off the packaging and onto to the counter with a soft "tink" sound to which prompted  the jeweler to literally scream "BE CAREFUL" in my face.  After that I wiped his spit from my forehead and left his shop; I haven't been back since.< /Text>

My now husband bought me the engagement ring of my dreams. It is a Tacori set and he had to go out of town to buy it. The ring was a bit too big and not wearing it wasnt an option for me, I set out to find a temporary fix.

I went to a local jeweler and they said they could clamp a metal temporary sizer on the ring. I agreed and they clamped the sizer on. The second it was back in my hand I thought it had been ruined forever! There were deep scratches and dents all over the platnium ring! My eyes filled with tears instantly! I was told this was a normal thing to happen and I should have known. I left with a broken heart.

As I was driving home, I saw Jewelry To Go through my tears and wondered why I hadn't gone there in the first place. I walked in and Angie was the first to greet me and comfort me. She told me that her dad, Al could look at it and let me know what could be done. Within a few minutes my ring was being examined by Al. He assured me that he could make it better and he did. Within fifteen minutes I had my ring back in my hands in almost new condition. I want to add, I was not charged a dime!

The entire Alvarado family mended my broken heart that day, and they did it out of the kindness of their hearts. They restored my faith in jewelrs in this community. I don't think I could ever thank them enough!

On our wedding day my husband surprised me with a beautiful diamond necklace and earrings from none other than Jewelry To Go!<//Text>

Vinny and the whole team at Southern California Preowned were fantastic from the beginning. We were able to select a few cars that we wanted to test drive before arrival and they were ready for us when we go there. It was a simple, quick process from start to finish. We also had a few cosmetic concerns about the vehicle and the team at SoCAL Preowned was more than willing to address our concerns at no cost to us. I will definitely buy from them again.</text>

Looked like an old fashion place where you are talking to the people who run the place and not some faceless salesman at a dealership. They got me in and out in less than 30 minutes and that was including the test drive.  They even stayed open for me 30 minutes because I cane straight after work from the San Fernando Valley and it took me about an hour and a half to get there.  The Lexus CT 200 was awesome and in great condition.  There were a lot of beautiful cars there.< /review>< Pictures>

<Text>I came in March this year to buy a used Fiat 500e.  This was my first electric vehicle so obviously I had my questions/concerns, Daniel was very helpful in answering the questions I had.  He is very knowledgeable about electric cars, particularly this one as they do tend to sell a lot of these.  I did end up driving off in a 500e and 3 months after I am very happy with my purchase.

My only issue is the hidden costs that we were not told about until the end.  I went in with the sticker price in mind plus estimate for tax and registration.  They wanted to charge me $500 for not using their financing (I already had that worked out), and another $1000 ish in other "fees" which they were never clear on what they were for.  However, after some negotiations, we were able to come to a deal that worked out for the both of us.  Come prepared to negotiate and always clarify the price BEFORE you test drive and get attached to the vehicle.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>{'time': 1623803371596, 'text': 'Dear Jonathan,\n\nThank you for the allowing Daniel Brewer the privilege to assist you during your quest for your first electric vehicle.

The price of the payments weren’t where I wanted them but I wanted the car so I agreed, they had told me they already had an approval from a bank for my down trade in and monthly payments all I needed to submit was my social security card? And pay stubs so I did that the very next morning then they said they still needed an approval from a bank??? Why waste my time and lie they only ran my credit a good 10 times dropping it even lower and kept telling me they’d “call me back”. I saw a minimum of 10 people walk out the door since I got there that day, these guys can’t sell cars and only want to win they.

<text>Sinbad and Michael helped me out, and they were stellar. When I got to the car lot, Michael pretty much had the car ready for me to test drive. He showed me a route where I could test the car fairly: highway and streets. After we came back the bill was set in front of me, there were no frivolous charges expect for the standard taxes, title and registration. Afterwards, Sinbad got me up and running with financing and I drove out the car the day of. There were some hiccups along the way, but none of them were SCPs fault.

If you're looking to bargain, you're not gonna have much luck here since SCP relies on volume sales and the prices that are listed for a particular car are not going to go down by a substantial amount.

Some suggestions for the dealership:
1. I think it would benefit SCP if you included or list the accessory fee (which is a legitimate charge) on your website or have that known to your next customer up front, so that there are absolutely no surprises.
2. List total price including taxes and title in the second line in a smaller text, or have a tax and title calculator embed into the car listing page so that your next customers know the full amount to expect.

Overall, SCP is an honest dealership and I recommend other people to patronize Southern California Preowned.< /text>< pics>

<Review>Fantastic car dealership. I bought a pre-owned Volt here two months ago and am super happy with it. It was honestly a relief to come here after days of going from dealership to dealership. My salesperson, Kat, was respectful, relaxed, and very knowledgeable about the car. Never pushy or condescending, which is more than I can say about other dealers. Hector was a pleasure to work with as we finalized the paperwork. Good, honest, professional, respectful people -- highly recommended.<//Review>< Pictures>

<date>1603397937279</date><Rate>1</Rate><review>Buyer beware!   I was extremely disappointed in the deceptive advertising used  by this dealer.   The advertised price for the Jeep I was interested in was reasonable and led me to reach out to them.  When I called to express my interest, I was told that the real price of the Jeep was approximately $7,000 higher than advertised!  According to the dealer, the lower advertised price did not include accessories that were already installed on the vehicle, and the additional $7,000 was to pay for these accessories.  From my perspective, an open and honest dealer would have identified these accessories and the higher price--which were already known--up front in the advertisement.   This was a classic "bait and switch"  deceptive marketing trick--use a low price to get my interest and then drop the higher price on me once I was lured in.   It is hard enough to trust  a "used car salesman," and these folks don't make it any easier.  A hard no for me.<//review>< pictures>

I can highly recommend this dealership!

First I was hesitant to get our car from here, since the price they offered was considerably lower than other dealers and I thought there might be a catch in it. I even waited for a while to test out the car on longer term before leaving a review to be as accurate as possible.

Now that we've been using our car for more than a month and we put about 3.000 miles in it, I can say that it was an exceptional buy. Although it had 2 little problems that came out, the car repair shop they have contract with, immediately fixed them under the repair warranty they offer for an affordable extra price. They also offer a maintenance warranty for a minimal cost that covers oil change, etc. They've already changed the oil in our car once, instantly, without having to call them in advance.

Daniel is the nicest, most helpful and polite sales guy you can deal with and it was a real pleasure to meet him! George, the manager was also great and he worked together with us to find the best and most affordable option for us (he lowered the price of the car and the price of the maintenance and repair warranty as well, since our original budget was lower).

Overall, this is the greatest and most affordable place if you want to buy a car, with nice and helpful staff who will work with you on the price and the services they offer. ☺️</review>

I bought a 2017 Chevy Volt yesterday from Southern California Preowned and I can't stop smiling. Charlie was super down to earth and I actually enjoyed the whole experience. He was cool about our initial conversations being through email and texts--which allowed me more freedom and time to research. At the dealership, he listened to my priority list and helped me figure out which direction to go in picking out a vehicle that would best meet my particular needs.

He was very knowledgeable about the Chevy Volt and hybrid cars in general. That was immensely helpful in my decision making. He was able to answer all my questions and even give me tips to improve mpg. Not only that, he made working with my credit union (to finance the loan) seamless. I'd say he cut out about 4 hours and 3 days of hassle for me. Phew. That's the stuff that kills me.

I finished up with the manager, Jose, who was very professional, fast, and friendly. Our part took about 20 minutes (only) and again--was seamless and therefore painless. Thank you again to Charlie and Jose for making my experience professional, pleasant, seamless, and rewarding. I left with a smile that still hasn't left.

Very happy customer,

Tamara C.< /Text>

<review>Hands down the best car buying experience!

I was shopping for a used EV online when I came across Southern California Preowned. The dealership is in Anaheim and I’m in Northern Nevada. I’m a very skeptical person and I was hesitant to not only purchase a car sight unseen, but also trade my existing car to them. Hector and Alexa were great! They answered all my questions and were very patient with me. Alexa even did a thorough FaceTime walkthrough of the car so I could examine the details of it for myself. The deal went through without a hitch! They sent my new vehicle to me on a car carrier and picked up my trade in (almost 500 miles away) for a beyond reasonable total price. The experience made me feel confident like I was purchasing a car from Amazon.com! The car I purchased arrived in excellent condition and is super fun to drive. Southern California Preowned has made me a believer that purchasing a car online and remote delivery is the future of automobile sales.

Now if only the DMV was as efficient as Southern California Preowned.

After shopping extensively I bought my 2017 Jeep here. I had visited 4 other dealerships everyone tries to bait and switch. This place is honest and hard working everything was straight, the advertised price was the price without argument and no one pressured me to buy any accessories. I was in and out quickly and the car was cleaned and perfect. This was the best buying experience I have ever had, I highly recommend this dealership!</Review>

I emailed the dealership requesting a specific Fiat 500e to be fully charged and once I arrived the car was clean and ready on time just as requested. After checking out the car, we settled on a final price and I was in and out of the dealership within 1.5 hours, quick and easy transaction. Would recommend to a friend.</review>< pictures>

We were looking for a trustworthy dealer to trade our car in and buy a good used car.  This is our second used car bought here!  The main point here is that the service received from Mr. Charlie Ponteres was exceptional!  Right from when I called & spoke to him over the phone to the end of the purchase transaction, he was understanding and very patient with what I am looking for.  Will definitely return to get a 3rd car from them.</Text>

We couldn't have asked for a better experience than working with Daniel at Southern CA Pre-owned. I'd been searching for an EV at a reasonable price. After looking online for weeks it was clear that they had the best used car inventory (with several different EVs that we could test drive at one location) and prices that were very reasonable. We met with Daniel on  Wednesday and were impressed with his familiarity with battery electric cars but we're most happy about his direct candor and patience while we made our decision. We returned the next day and finished all the paperwork in a short amount of time and without ANY hassle whatsoever. This company and Daniel in particular earned our business and I'll be recommending them to anyone who is thinking about buying a quality used car.</review>

Went to look at a car, liked one and started negotiations by asking for $500 off the advertised price. Salesman went and got the "Sales Manager" who stated he could not reduce the price and then added an additional $1298 dealer fee to the price. I almost spit out the complimentary water they gave me.  Their website discloses nothing about additional dealer fees, only document fees, which is completely different.  I would have paid the advertised price.  Good luck with this business model.<//review>

<review>Sales Representative Charlie..is the best and the finance team! I purchased Toyota Avalon on 11/16/2019 a used car very good condition, fully loaded. I am not just happy with the car and deal I received, but also happy about the warranty and other guarantees that came with car good price. Iam happy about how fast I was  approved. My app was submitted to finance companies that would accept my fair credit. I can afford note. Charlie communicated with me and kept me informed  about everything. A to Z. I recommend this dealership they also have lots of gas saving cars please check them out. They work hard for you.

<Date>1596749875191</Date><Review>I bought a car from this place and they did not tell me that the car only has one key fob. After I purchased the car and I picked it up, they just gave me one key. When I asked for the second key, they said this is how it is and no one was responsible. Every car should have two key fobs and I should have been informed before I purchase the car.
Also the car had barely gas when I picked it up. And as I asked them to fulfill the gas tank they only did it half way.

Answer to your reply:
Yes that is true but the buyer should be notified in advance that the car only has one key. NOT WHEN THE CAR IS PURCHASED< /Review><Gmap_id>0x80dd299100000001:0xcf23cc32dd085dda< /Gmap_id>< rate>

This company is guilty of false advertising. After viewing a car on carfax, we proceeded to place a deposit and communicated via email, text and phone with Freddy over a period of two days. When we received the final invoice there was an additional charge $1300.00 for supposed accessories of which there are none. They would not remove the charge. Needless to say we did not go through with the purchase. They are adding to the reputation of used car dealers of being shysters.<//text>

We are in the business of selling cars and we would love to sell a car to everyone, if possible.

We always try to get the best rate for them. Unfortunately, we don't control what third-party transportation companies charge, a list factors go into the cost, first it is your location, current gas prices, etc. Lastly, there's a few items that go into a contract that are inevitable, city taxes according to your location, governments fees. I do understand your disappointment but please know sometimes our hands are tied as a dealership since these fees are out of our control.

<date>1586472721033<//date><rate>5<//rate><review>For me, this is one of my best selling experiences. For the past few months, I've dealt with variable sales pitches and presentations, yet was ALWAYS bombarded with dealer add ons that jacked up the pricing on literally every other vehicle, but these guys really worked with me. Hector was responsive and attentive, it did not take several days, nor weeks, for a deal to be scheduled, he did not push, nor rush, the negotiations, he did not minimalize my business, and he thoroughly communicated any issues that could, may, and did, occur. I struck deals simultaneously, as you should to understand your best financially sound option, and, although several vehicles were cheaper, each vehicle ended up costing more than the one Hector sold me. Jay brought the car all the way to Riverside for me, with a smile, and confirmed the comfortability and reliability of this dealership. Both were very amiable, even when I first regarded my "not so convenient" buying position. So, yes they will work with you, but you must be able to be worked with as well; they're able to do their job quite well, and it is very much appreciated! Go here, buy here, they have Toyotas, and their able to do what you need; way better than even the recent Toyota dealer "discoveries" I made.. take this as you will. 👍👍</review>< pics>

Out of state buyer here, completely satisfied.  Didn't even see or test drive the car because of the guarentee of quality that this dealership provides.  Made the purchase agreement via email with Freddy the amazing internet sales manager and then he overnighted the contract, shipped the car and it showed up at my doorstep 3 days after purchase.  Registration was a breeze and Freddy made sure I had everything I needed.  The whole team really earned our business.  They are easy to work with, understanding and quick!  Highly recommended.</review>

<Rating>1</Rating><Text>On Dec 4, 2019 I purchased a used 2014 Audi S6 from Southern
California Preowned. The dollar amount in dispute is $2500 due
to a preexisting motor Mount issue that was not disclosed and or
should be covered under the dealer limited warranty of 6
thousand miles / six months on powertrain. The car was taken
to Mission Viejo Audi and OC tuning in Lake Forest Ca for an
purchase inspection. Before I purchased the car I was told all cars
are throughly inspected prior to sale and they provide a 6 month
powertrain warranty on all cars. I called and emailed the sales
General Manager HectorTorres regarding the issue and he replied
they can not cover the repair. I also sent Hetor Torres the quote
from the Mechanic indicating the fault code was 8 months old!. He asked me to bring the car in and have his
mechanics inspect the car once again. I did so, and the outcome
was "yes the motor mounts are bad and need replaced". He also sold me a 24 month maintenance plan that he has yet to reimburse me on or provide a refund!. At
this point I have no other option but to "file a complaint. I have

Didn't make a deal here, but these guys were straightforward and did not waste my time.  Pro tip, there's no such thing as dealer fee of any amount and DMV transfer fee of $400.  Don't ever pay that when you negotiate.<//Review>

<Text>I bought a vehicle about 2 months ago and I honestly am not satisfied with the purchase. First they tried to add about 1200 in accessories?? Then the sensor light went on after test driving, so we asked for them to fix it before we purchased the vehicle and they said they would. When we came back to pick up the vehicle the sensor light was still on. We were told to drive it around for a week and if the sensor was still on to bring it back. After a week we called and they informed us that it would be an extra charge to fix! Besides the sensor, all 4 tires were bad and the weather stripping was torn and they never fixed the sensor for us as they said they would!  I will not be purchasing again from this place. The only reason I gave them 2 stars is because they kept our vehicle on hold for us.<//Text>< pictures>

< review>
First of all i drove 500 miles to pick up my VW Jetta Sportwagen TDI. I use to sell cars so i have a very high expectations to how a dealership should treat people. They did not exceed my expectations but they met them and with my high standards i was happy. Worked with Freddy he was great, not overly professional and not dull like most salesman afraid to be themselves.   If you decide to stop by just ask for Freddy he'll work on your side.<//review>

<review>This place charges an additional "maintenance" fee above the advertised asking price.  I used Carfax to find the car that I wanted and when we sat down to look at the total cost, there was an additional $1,395 fee on top of the asking price of a $14,000 car.

When I asked what this fee was the salesperson said this is our profit margin.  He then started negotiating a lower fee.  He crossed off the 1 in front of the $1,395 and said "what if I can get my manager to accept $395?"

I said, I thought I would be negotiating from the asking price, not from an additional fee.

They then showed me what they paid for the car.  It was purchased from a fleet and indeed they apparently paid more than the current asking price.

They had a half dozen of these used car models on the lot, which haven't been moving according to Carfax, so I assumed they would rather move their inventory.  But I was wrong.

The manager shows up, who acts like a "tough guy" says, let me give this to you straight.  This is the deal.  He shows that the additional fee is going to be $695 and I had to take it or leave it.

Can you guess what I did?

While the salesman was very helpful, and I was fully prepared to purchase this particular vehicle at their original asking price, I was not prepared to pay more.  This is false advertising.  This is their trick.

OK, you've been warned.<//review></record>

I traveled about an hour to look at a couple cars that seemed a little too good to be true. After the second trip back to finally purchase the vehicle they told me they add an extra $1300 to the listed price, so yes advertised prices are cheap but when you are serious about buying they tell you this information.

Very good treatment for a used car dealer. Just like any dealer, expect additional charges on the sale contact. Look before you sign. Remember to calculate sales tax and fees on the CA DMV website and double check costs.</Text>

{'time': 1555355815930, 'text': 'Good Morning Albert, I would like to start by saying that our service department does a thorough inspection on all of our cars and we will never intentionally reverse tires due to the fact that we are very big on the safety of our customers. We will never rush delivery of a vehicle specially when the vehicle is going out of the country. The transport company that you chose must have failed to let you know when they were picking the vehicle up. As far as the key battery, we went ahead and made you an extra key per your request. Please feel free to give me a call to further discuss.'}<//Response>
< Text>
Very nice sales personnel but ..........
I brought a car from them this January and later found out.......
1. Promised to replaced key battery but failed
2. Sheet metal damaged without notice but made rush delivered.
Clean Certified Service report obtained against my purchasing.to prove no damage.
3. Intentionally Reversed two front tires no to show serious side wearing.
4. I insisted pick up must be my present, but they did not ......
My real very very negative experience
This is out of state deliivert and pick up by trucker

Sirs,

Appreciated your reply....
The facts are
1. The Service Report obtained from your next door told nothing wrong just needed new key battery,
Jose said piece of cake.....
2. Second key was promised per contract

So, you own me some answers
1. Whom was responsible to turn the tires (left to right),  or, it was from outside.......
Possible to creat accidents if drive.......
2. Whom and when made this serious sheet metal damage and pitched it up try to covered...
3. I clearly told the pick up must be my present, but Delivery Note not signed by me......
Please help me to help yourself
Albert

Sir,
I am still waiting for your reply to my second mail to you,
Service report gave no defects but actually not, are you responsible to check and come out with truth?
Albert
April 18

Sir,
I am still waiting for your response, get to the point what’s happened/damage to my car.

Disappointed Replace Your Ride dealer
We went there twice just want to buy a used e-golf within our budget. I called a salesman and asked about a certain car. He said it was in good condition. We scheduled a time to test drive it. The first time I went there to test drive that car but they said it was gone just the day before. They then offered me another car of which the condition was much worse. We tried it but didn't like it. We left without any result.

After a while, I saw they had new e-golfs posted and so I asked the salesman the condition of one white car and they said it was in good condition and charged it full for me to test drive. So, we went there the second time. We finally agreed to buy the car and the salesman wrote a price list for us. The price ADD EXTRA $1300 dealer fee to it. I read all the reviews and knew that they tried to get extra money in this way, so I reject it. He then took it off and after negotiation he finally agreed to lower the price about $350 from the posting price of $10450 if we were ready to sign the contract immediately. We agreed to sign the contract immediately. However, the management team didn't honor the agreed price between the salesman and us,  they didn't reduce the $350 from the price tag, BUT they ADD ANOTHER ACCESSORIES FEE of $299 to the contract price. We didn't want to be abused in this way so we left!

Update May 25, 2019

The next day, I received a text message from the sales manager:
'My name is Hector Torres, I'm the Sales manager for Southern California Pre-owned. I see that we did not make a deal with you yesterday and I see your review in google. It's bothering me that my team did not give you exceptional service as they are instructed to. I would like to extend my services and make a deal with you. I believe you to pay only 4000 after your replace your ride voucher. If that is correct I would like for you to come back and I will personally make that happen for you.'

So, I went back to meet Hector. He greeted me and asked me to remove the review after the deal was done. Well, I promised him I would update the review with his offer and I really did now. I signed the contract though the contract price was still $178 more than the agreed price before, since I didn't want to waste time to argue about that with them.

They promised to fix 3 scratches on the car before I signed the contract. I'll update the review when the time I get the car and see if they really honor to their promise.

I'll also put up another update after I got the car and used for a while to see if there are any hidden issues.</review>

My girlfriend and I bought a 2012 Crysler Town and Country minivan at Southern California Pre Owned car dealership.
We met there Dan and George. They are very nice guys, absolutely professional, and helpful. We got a great deal. Their prices are very affordable.

I highly recomend this place if you want to buy a car.<//Text>

< review>
After a back and forth with the sales manager George, I found a Volt that was equivalent in mileage and that was cheaper than what the dealership had advertised. I had contacted him and I was told to send him the information and he would "match the price".

I did so and I was told that it was a good price and he couldn't match it. To me, that seemed like he thought I wasn't truthful even though I was. I would advise anyone that purchases a used car, to be aware of the tactics used at this used car lot. Do your homework, there's other dealerships or used car lots that would give you better service and that would be completely honest with you.

Lastly, in my type of business that I do, I would never have a customer send over price information after telling them that I would match it only to send them off to another competitor and tell them you can't do it. Horrible way of doing business.</review>

I had been looking to purchase a car for a while now and came across Socal preowned. I called them immediately and they waited for me even past the closing time. Not only was I able to get a good deal, I was finally able to get financing through them. They were so helpful, kind and willing to help. I also got a really good deal for a very clean car that i'm soooo in love with :D. I highly highly recommend them for your purchase, I have no regrets whatsoever.

(Translated by Google) I am not honest. It is necessary to confirm the actual contract. Deceiving advertising prices. It is a place where salespeople keep changing their words and anyway.

I took my cat in as she was having bladder issues.  My regular vet treated her a couple of weeks ago but she relapsed and couldn't pee.  Since they were closing when I called they said to take her to emergency.  Called Sage and they said to bring her in and call when I got there.  After I got there, about 5:10pm on Saturday, and checked her in over the phone, it took an hour for them to see her.  They never told me there the wait would be that long so we just sat in the car.  When the doctor finally examined her and called me, she rattled off a list of things she recommended, (medicine, x-rays, blood/urine tests) to the tune of over $1000.  I said to just give her enough medicine for a day and I would take her back to her regular vet.  When I went to check her out it was well over $300, $168 being the office visit,  $110 for one medicine plus a 2nd medicine, which I can't remember the price of.  I was shocked and expressed it.  The doctor gave me a discount to just under $300.  I verified that I was only getting enough medicine for Sunday as I already had an appointment for Monday morning with her vet and they said it was only enough to get me through a couple of days.  I paid the bill and went home.  The time spent there was 2 hours, with 30 minutes just waiting to get my cat back.  The bill was supposed to be emailed but still haven't received it and it's the next morning.  Never going back.</Text>

<Name>Ian Brekke<//Name><Text>Our cat Benjamin had a heart condition that was not caught by multiple vets, which ultimately led to an emergency trip to SAGE for heart failure. They were able to stabilize him and extend his life for an additional 5 months - precious time with our pet that we will savor for the rest of our lives. Every interaction with the SAGE team was positive, professional, compassionate, and clear. We were at the facility multiple times over those 5 months and each trip was consistent in these traits, so we feel confident that this is who they are. We would not hesitate to recommend SAGE to anyone else in need. Our only caveat is that their cardiologist is extremely over-booked and that appointments are several months out, making follow-ups difficult to handle in a timely manner. In emergency situations they were still able to fit us in, which we greatly appreciated.< /Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPM5WTmhhxAmq9u-76jM5P8S0tPbhmqC8Tkmzos=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< Gmap_id>

We found it necessary to use Sage because our personal vet (and even more local back-up ER option) was booked. Sage, Dublin was suggested and we are glad we chose them. Dr. Lukas as well as all attendants we interacted with were attentive and engaged with us, even under Covid conditions. Everyone was extremely thorough in asking the right questions, and explaining next steps. We left the clinic with well crafted directives and follow up info. We wouldn't hesitate in using Sage, Dublin again if needed.</review>

We have used a local private practice vet for years, but when our dog died on a Sunday morning we had nowhere else to go. I honestly expected indifferent service from a chain this size, but instead the staff was very sympathetic and helpful. I’m so glad they were there when we needed them, and I will probably go back when we have another dog.<//Text>

< review>
Went to sage because my 8 month old puppy has been feeling sick. Waited 1 hour just for them to even see him in the car. Then the doctor was so rude when text came back didn't want to help at all just keeper telling us how much money it was going to cost instead of telling us a treatment plan.
Didn't care about our dog just money. So we called a bunch of vets around got him right into Apollo vet in walnut creek. They said bring him now and we will take care of your dog no wait time. And they were very helpful.

Will not be going to see anymore after this very horrible experience.< /review>

<Text>I am writing this review after losing my dog, cremating him, and having spent $977.64 here on two visits.
I do not recommend this place, and am now averse even to traveling to Dublin because of my depressing experience here.

The care received for the $977.64 included two consultations, a subcutaneous injection of fluid (which pet owners can do themselves), and an IV drip that lasted less than an hour. My dog never got life-saving care, though my family and I waited outside this office for two entire afternoons.

During our second visit, our dog waited for 1.5 hours outside before he was seen. After calling their supervisor to try to ask what was going on and tell them that another vet had said my dog needed fluids ASAP, the supervisor spoke to me unpleasantly and condescendingly, explaining how my dog needing fluid therapy was of less concern than a dog with heart failure.  I understand this, but when my dog was later seen, we were told he was dying.

Hence, while I waited in a car with my dog and called repeatedly to advocate for his care, my dog was dying at the doorstep of this ER. This is different from another ER I went to (Beacon Vet in Fremont, where my dog eventually passed), as they had a COVID protocol where a vet tech would wait outside to triage a pet. SAGE seemed to rely on some amount of self-triage / triage done through the phone, and that disappointed me.

When we were finally seen, they did not proceed with the care we had hoped for and told us to euthanize (with some pressure), because his kidneys were failing. While I can understand SAGE may have thought his case was futile,   other vets at Banfield on that day and the *next* day thought that my dog still had a chance. He just needed fluid therapy, which he had previously responded well.

I am unhappy with SAGE because my dog didn't get much care or attention here for the $977.64 that evaporated while we tried to save him. I regret driving cities over for SAGE and wish I had gone to the local ER.

I also wish I had my dog back, but nothing's going to change that.</Text>< pictures>

My 14yr old chihuahua had to be rushed into Sage in the early morning for Tracheal Collapse due to the heat. The staff was nothing but great. They ran out the car and rushed her into the oxygen chamber. Due to COVID we couldn’t go in with her but they kept us up to date. We knew our dog was in good hands when they informed us we would be able to take her home with the right medication after being at Sage for 14 hours. Great first experience with this clinic!<//text>

<Review>I can not say enough amazing things about this office. I unfortunately had to euthanize my dog, but I am so grateful that I did it there. The staff- warm, caring, thoughtful, and quick. The vet: straight forward, explanatory, sympathetic and honest. Highly suggest them, they made an extremely difficult time a little less painful.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>It has been almost two weeks since I had to bring my beloved Bella to Sage for the final time.  I am still very sad but it was time and I am comforted at the memory of how loving and caring Sage staff was during my final moments with Bella.  I really cant thank them enough ...< /Review><user_name>Necia Omo<//user_name>< rate>

We took her here due to it was the first place we got to answer that was the closest open place at the time(I believe they're open 24/7 but not 100%). They took care of the problem we only waited about an hour and a half before they had her back  out to us looking 100% better. The price really wasnt to bad I was thinking great here goes another grand. But when we asked how much do we owe they said $290 I was surprised due to it being an Emergency room visit,that's not bad at all. Overall everything went good. - Nice people,effective,reliable,affordable and hopefully don't have to but if we need a pet emergency place again would have no problem going straight here next time.< /Text>< response>

I drove
2hours from Sonora today with my friend & her dog. SAGE techs and vet were absolutely wonderful and compassionate. Sadly her dog didn't survive but it was made easier due to the amazing staff. Highly recommend SAGE Veterinary.< /review>

We recently and suddenly lost our cat without warning. I called the Sage Dublin team in panic the night it occurred. The team was so incredibly sensitive in collecting the information needed, they advised they would be waiting and even thoughtfully reminded me to drive carefully.

When we arrived, Kimberly was waiting and stayed with us from the beginning to the end. They allowed us to stay with our cat until we were ready. Kimberly had the time and patience to look at our pictures and listen to our stories about our cat. I just received a very personal, handwritten sympathy card from Kimberly, filled with heartfelt sentiments I will never forget.

We live in Hayward and the love and care this team gives is absolutely worth the extra miles!!</review>

< Review>
I wish I could give Sage a lower rating! I called them as I was rushing my new malamute puppy over (since my vet was already closed for the night). My puppy ingested a small condiment container (that I thought was out of her reach) and I knew I had to get her to emergency ASAP.  We had a rough 15 minute window to get to the emergency so they could induce vomiting to get the condiment container out otherwise it would be further along her digestive tract and would lead to complications and maybe surgery. When I called and spoke to the staff at Sage - they said they didn't have a wait and even if they did when I arrived, they would ensure she was taken back immediately to get the process started. When I arrived, I wasn't acknowledged.  I tried to get the attention of the staff but couldn't as they were socializing amongst themselves. The waiting room was empty except for another couple waiting for their dog to be discharged. As soon as I approached the counter, I was impolitely told to "hold on". I stood there and waited for about 5-7 minutes and at this point the 15 minute window to induce vomiting was almost up - I started to get anxious! I apologized and interrupted the staff to asked how much longer will I have to wait and pressed the time that we had left to induce vomiting. The staff rolled her eyes at me and sighed while her co-worker smirked - I was shocked! She said she had to register me into their system and started asking me various questions. I kindly asked if I could send my puppy back while I complete the registration process and she said "no". The registration took roughly 3-5 minutes and then she told me to wait and they'll take my puppy back when they're free - no ETA or sense of urgency. The thought of waiting longer and allowing the possibility of further complications made me extremely nervous. I decided to quickly search on my phone for other emergency vet's in the area and I found IronHorse Vet Care (down the street). I called them (while I was in the waiting area Sage) and asked if they have a current wait time and they said they do but also that doesn't matter typically because each pet is assessed differently based on whats going on. After I told them what happened - they told me to come immediately. I got up and started to walk out and the staff saw me but didn't ask if I was going to step outside or if I will be returning? I felt so uncomfortable but I pushed that feeling aside and quickly got my puppy into the car and drove to IronHorse!

When I arrived at IronHorse VetCare the staff, nurse, and doctor were waiting for me in the lobby as I pulled up. They took my puppy in the back right away! They could sense how stressed I was and offered me water/coffee/tea and to take a few minutes to sit/relax and breathe before they started the process to register her.  I didn't even finish the registration process - when the doctor came out to show me the condiment container (TMI - but they wanted to ensure it was exactly what she ate and reassure me that they got it out). I was literally in and out so fast and the service was so personal compared to SAGE!

I finally got a call back from Sage that night (about 45 minutes later) saying they're ready to take my puppy back and that she might need x-rays etc.. because of the time that had elapsed.

I couldn't believe (1) how long they waited to finally take her in when they told me that they would see her immediately upon my arrival. (2) The delay, rudeness, and lack of urgency from the front staff could've potentially caused severe complications for my puppy and cost me a lot of money (3) how bad my first experience was there and how I am never returning. I continue to tell all of my friends and family (and they've shared to their community) to save themselves of the stress and injustice  of going to Sage!

I highly recommend taking your pet to a more professional and genuine establishment (like IronHorse VetCare - NOT SAGE) that truly respects, cares, and empathizes with your pet while understanding and prioritizing all of your concerns.< /Review>

After a long saga in which my cat visited two other emergency vets where he went undiagnosed and I discovered he had a huge abscess that had ruptured while he was at one of the other vets, my local vet referred me to SAGE to get the treatment he needed. Drs Richardson and Valverde were great and all of the staff was really helpful in answering all of my questions and helping me get my cat better. He is almost there and I am grateful for the excellent care he has received at SAGE.< /text>

I can’t say enough good things about this hospital. I was on a Road trip when my dog started having seizures. I received excellent care for him but just as important was the fact that I continued to call them with questions/concerns for the next couple of weeks! They even told me once I returned to Washington if I had questions I could still contact them.
I’m very impressed with Sage!< /text>

If I could give them 0 stars I would. The veterinarian Dr. April Le Blanc has very poor bed side manner and stated "that she doesn't about  the animal and it is all about the money". There is another Dr Robert Lucus that cancelled a test that we already paid for on our dog, and he never even saw our fur baby.
Their prices are ridiculous and we found another ER hospital,  Ironhorse Veterinarian Hospital that is close by and who really care about are fur babies and are reasonably priced.
In other words, not driven by the dollar, but by genuine love for animals.</Text>

<rating>5<//rating><review>Came to Sage referred by my usual vet, Bishop Ranch. Was worried going elsewhere because I have a few ACTUAL horror stories from other vets from before I found Bishop Ranch.

These people were amazing. I am blown away by their kindness and groundedness even during the middle of this shelter in place chaos.

I didn't have time to read reviews before I left my best friend in their care at 12 am. While in the parking lot waiting to hear how my baby was doing I started looking at reviews. A lot of good reviews and some that made me question my decision. Dr. April Leblanc was mentioned in one and happened to be the Dr. on the case involving my babe.
Dr. April is amazing, very straight forward, informative, and made sure I understood not just the injury but the situational danger that lead to this specific injury. There's no doubt in my mind she has a true care and concern for the animals in her care.

The rest of the staff I interacted with was also amazing. Ryan, Ramon, Coreena are just a few of the names I remember but they were all amazing. My dog Is skiddish untrusting of anyone that isn't her people and not easy to handle. With the shelter order I couldn't believe they even got her through the front door without a great deal of trauma and Coreena did no problem at all. Even afterwards when I brought Queen home they took the time to walk me through steps I needed to take on my own for the Queen.

Their patience, kindness, confidence and experienced service I will remember and you cannot put a dollar sign on any of that. I am so grateful for each one of them that night.

I felt they charged what they needed to charge and nothing more.

So if you are sitting in your truck at 2 am in the Sage parking lot like I was, scared my best friend wouldn't ever be the same and wondering if you made the right choice don't worry you are in very good hands here.

Thanks again and I apologize if I misspelled any names in this review.</review><gmap_id>0x808fec6bd7a447cd:0x2e668258d43d7700<//gmap_id><response>{'time': 1589404149244, 'text': 'Hi Kóree, Thank you for sharing this great review of our hospital!

< Review>
During a heart-crushing time, the people at SAGE were beyond compassionate as I made incredibly difficult decisions for my pet. Over the course of treatment, they kindly and sensitively provided me with options that allowed me to address each course of action involving quality of life, finances, and treatment. I cannot recommend this caring, considerate, thoughtful group of people highly enough.<//Review>

< Review>
Terrible emergency service.. brought my dog in and asked wait time and was told no more than 30 mins for nurse to take vitals.. over an hour and 3 requests still no nurse..
Update to your response.
I came in 520pm with a sick dog that has been throwing up and lethargic. Barely any movement in his body. I asked the front desk what's the time frame and he said 30 mins for a nurse and no more than hr for the doctor.. I sat and waited as everyone else got help even people after me. I asked 1hr in what's going on since I had to be late for work they will find out.. 15 mins passed and I asked again and they said 5 mins a nurse will be out.. another 15 mins passed and I just told them to cancel and I'm leaving and the desk said oh did the nurse not come out yet.. I was like whatever and left. There was only one other couple there and they had a nurse come out and take their pet for vitals. They could have done the same for me but somehow just decided to ignore me. You guys are willing to change 150 for emergency visit but your urgency doesn't equal the visit. If you told me it will take over hr and half to have him seen I wouldn't have wasted an hr of half to 2 hrs of my time at your clinic.</Review>

An incredible vet hospital that saved my best friend's life. Everybody who works there, inside and out of the emergency rooms was friendly, kind and hospitable with a high level of professionalism. If your furry friend needs help, this is the place to go. PS: Sugar-free chewing gum is extremely toxic to dogs and can easily be fatal. The more you know!</Text>

I have had a great experience each time.  The staff and especially the veterinarians are very caring and thorough.  Recently, my dog swallowed a peach pit and needed a $4,000 surgery.  We have pet insurance but the policy is that you pay up front and then get reimbursed.  They worked with us so that we could have the insurance pay them directly and didn't have to put out all of that money up front.  I cannot say how much this is appreciated.  I would have sold my car if I needed to so that my baby would get better!

Am so glad that there's a place to bring a pet at all hours! I brought both my dogs here and I find the front office very accommodating, fast and efficient. The vets are very caring and also updated and well informed. Being a doctor, I have an idea of whats needed to assess a condition and havent noticed anything out of the ordinary in what they ask for in terms of labs. yes they are expensive but its worth it.< /Text>

It turned out to be an infection in his stomach and he had to stay overnight for treatment. I picked him up Saturday and 2 days later he is already back to normal! I’m so grateful to Sage for helping my little guy! I loved that the front desk staff and the nurses I worked with really seem to care, and Dr. Nohava was fantastic.

I’m posting this review a year after the fact because I heard that Sage is so vindictive if you write a negative review they refuse to treat your pet even if it is a life or death emergency. We are moving out of the area so we will never have to use Sage again but wanted to warn others about them. My then 1 1/2 year old Lab, Brownie, fractured a toe while running through some brush. Our regular vet doesn’t provide orthopedic services and referred us to Sage. The vet took X-rays, examined Brownie and said that the fracture couldn’t be repaired surgically. The treatment was splinting which required changes at least weekly. This was a nightmare trying even with sedation to keep an active dog on bed rest. She even developed bandage disease. These dressing changes were over $400 a pop. I decided to take her to UC Davis for a second opinion and was told she could have had surgery if it was done immediately after the fracture (at the time we had her at Sage). I emailed the director of that location and never received a response. While in the waiting room at UC Davis, another pet owner was elaborating on problems they had at the same Sage location.<//Text>

<name>Alex Sandstrom<//name><Date>1459977331907</Date><Text>I wouldn't think of taking my animals anywhere else for emergency or specialty care. Sage is THE BEST in the area. At this point, I think we've seen every doctor on staff at this location between our two dogs, cat, and visiting family dogs, and we've never received anything other than outstanding care and professionalism. The nurses, doctors, and techs go above and beyond in spending time to explain everything and answer questions- we've NEVER felt like we were rushed and always felt well taken care of. We've run the gamut in terms of visit types: injury emergencies, orthopedic injuries/surgery, emergency surgery for things that shouldn't have been eaten, oncology, etc. Everyone in every department is excellent. Our family can't say enough good things about the staff at Sage.

The price is a little higher than some other emergency centers, but when you consider the level of care received and the fact that they are available 24/7, the cost is MORE than fair.< /Text>< gmap_id>

While under the care of others, our dog was hit by a car.  While he sustained no broken bones, the internal damage was severe.  He required three hours of emergency surgery.  We were out of town at the time, and frantic with worry & emotion while all of this was going on.
Sage and Dr. Flynn to the rescue.  Six months later and our sweet baby has made a complete physical recovery thanks to the care and expertise at Sage.
We will forever be thankful for that- as it could have easily been a very different outcome.

<review>Last month I went in with my German Shepherd and she had been mauled by another dog. I must add that just her ear was damaged. I took her quickly to an emergency vet in Antioch they stiched her up and have me antibiotics. The next day I took her to Sage in Concord who I simply Love. They recommend Sage in Dublin. I made an appointment which was kind of a mess as well,they had no information of my appointment. So to get to the point they took my girl in the back, after a short time the surgeon came in to speak with me. He flatly said 8to10k with an 85% chance of success. Or he recommended putting her to sleep right away. My mind was blown away. I'm thinking it's just an ear. I made an appointment for the surgery, but my gut said get another opinion. I went to Dr Gray from Antioch Animal hospital in Antioch. He came up with a plan I cleaned her wound daily and gave her antibiotics as well as scraping off the dead tissue. After two weeks and $333.00 she has her ear and is alive and well. I urge you all to get a second opinion. I also want to say that this Post in no way am I bashing Sage my distaste is strictly for the Surgeon and his pay me or kill the dog attitude. Out of my respect for Sage I won't post his name and will emphasize that this experience was with one surgeon at the Dublin office. I love every staff member at the Concord branch. And of course Dr Gray at Animal hospital of Antioch</review><pics>None</pics><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x808fec6bd7a447cd:0x2e668258d43d7700</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Terrible experience here. My poor dog had to wait nearly 3 hours for service when we came in after 11 pm. Apparently he came second to a cat who had a "real" emergency. Then they wanted all of these extra tests run even though they themselves didn't think there was anything seriously wrong enough with him to warrant timely service. Thankfully there are other emergency vet clinics in the area.</Text>< pictures>

I am giving this 5 star review specifically for Dr. Zuhal Elhan, DVM, front desk person and the nurse who attended on my lab retriever when he had an emergency at around 1 am. Dr.Elhan was simply amazing. A very compassionate individual who attended to my pet with great care and also called back to check on him! Thanks to their timely care my lab is healing very well now!< /Review>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Review>In my opinion Please take your animal anywhere but here! I saw NO COMPASSION for my service dog other than the front counter and the Doctor who admitted my dog. I saw my dog being dragged down a hall when I came to visit him the next day, I was told he was being feed and then the next day the Oncologist said he has not eaten in over twenty four hours and that maybe I should have brought food. the Oncologist told me to take my dog home and care for him myself!!! I called my Normal vet and she called the Oncologist and they agreed to let my service dog Gordy stay another day to try to get rid of the pneumonia that was why I brought him there in the first place!!! a couple of hours later she again wanted me to either take Gordy out of there or the euthanize him. My vet found me another 24 hour care facility around the corner ( Iron Horse ) so when I got to sage to pick up Gordy it took them an hour to get him to me, this was because they were figuring out the bill. Run as fast as you can from this place!!< /Review></record>

<Pics>None< /Pics><Text>Not impressed.  Wish I had not brought Toby here, but now we are $1000 in to getting a diagnosis.  Frst problem was when I asked about a rescue discount, I was told I had to call another office to get the discount established.  Not true, all they needed was the rescue's 501 papers.  Next problem, the first visit.  Very chaotic as vet kept getting pulled away for emergencies.  What should have been a 1 hour visit turned into 3 hours.  Next problem it is almost impossible to talk to the vet, they don't tell you when they are going to call, and when they do and you miss their call, it is impossible to get a hold of them. Also, I was told the vet would send an e-mail describing the results of the ultrasound, which I never received.  I finally, after numerous tries, was able to receive the e-mail.  Second visit was told to make a nurse appointment, which I did.  When I checked in, they told me I did not have an appointment.  Then they never explained, but a nurse named Janell, came and took Toby to do testing.  When she came back, I tried asking her how to get a video of how Toby walked, to his medical record.  She was extremely rude and condescending to me, asking me if I knew who I was seeing, and called me "Honey", and told me to refer how Toby walks to my current vet, as they were not neurologists.  When I went to pay the bill, it was different from what I had been quoted, and I said there was a problem, and pointed it out, and they said it was probably because of my discount.  I said I would have to sit down and study it.  As I was looking at it, they said they realized the problem, and redid the bill.  I find everything wrong, and I feel like I have to continually check and follow-up.  Your clinic is extremely frustrating to deal with.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
As a cat owner, I have had beyond terrible experiences at the Sage Dublin location. One cat passed away there and it was quite traumatic and the care was extremely lax and unsympathetic.  Another cat met with a specialist and they told me to let her out in the examination room ON THE FLOOR and let her run around the entire time!  I could tell that the floor was dirty and wondered how many other sick pets had roamed. They do know that cats wash their paws?  The care and empathy for both humans and animals must be improved.  My cat had pooped in her carrier on the way to the clinic, which I made clear to the front desk, and not a single assistant tried to get me into a room quickly in order to clean her up; I had to ASK the front desk to give me an available room (which they had a number of) after waiting.  Finally, I was having trouble with the carrier and door when leaving and almost tripped walking out (my shoe even fell off in the process); 3 receptionists sat and stared at me and no one offered a breath of help.  To be fair,  I must add that the specialist was very knowledgeable, but I wish that I could leave my cat at home (just show myself to discuss) and not have to put her through this experience.</Review>

I had brought my dog here, on a referral from my regular vet. I was very pleased with the vets care and services. Sadly to say after a year long fight with a blood disorder, my dog passed away, but it was because of the finr folks at Sage that my little dog was able to fight that fight, and their cremation services were very excellent. I will always be thankful for what Sage has done, and will always recommend them to anyone I know.<//review>

This is the only emergency vet I would ever go to.  I have been here many times with various pets of various species & have always received the highest quality of care. I have never once regretted choosing Sage.  If your pet is in serious trouble & you are scared you must come here.</text>

<review>So I never leave a bad review, but here it goes. My parrotlet had recently gotten hurt, when I got home from work I had found that he escaped his cage, I know that bad parenting on my end, well it turns out he flew and hit the window so hard he broke his beak. So I took him to my normal vet, it turns out the bird doctor has gone home for the day so they tried reffering me to another company. We called two other places before we called this place and they didnt have a vet who cares for birds, so finally someone mentioned Sage to us and we called. Well guess what the bird doctor was there but the receptionist asked what type of bird it was and put me on hold after a few min. He got back and said "well our bird vet doesnt feel comfortable seeing your bird today, you should try another place." All those minutes counted that we were trying to look for an emergency vet for our bird, in the end we finally found someone, but it was too late. Last night i los my Paco. I feel strongly if we would have gotten him help sooner and if the Sage vet "felt" like seeing him he would still be alive. Thank you Sage! I had a wonderful valentines day!< /review><gmapID>0x808fec6bd7a447cd:0x2e668258d43d7700< /gmapID><response>None</response><name>Rose Gutierrez</name><Rate>1< /Rate><pictures>None< /pictures><Time>1518731970108</Time><user_id>105091762986042539337< /user_id></record>

Dr Lukas, Dr. Morris, Dr. Boudreau, and Dr. LeBlanc are ALWAYS FABULOUS as well the fantstic staff. They always explain completely and are kind to the worried pet parents and beloved pet.

Again, THIS IS NOT COSTCO. The money you are paying is for the training, education, and the equipment  to diagnose quickly and accurately. This is an emergency specialty vet hospital, not the regular vet. They will inform you of the cost range before treating your pet. It is unfair to condemn them after the fact when you consent. Dr.'s run tests to rule out things as well, too.
The only reason it seems like it's costly is because most pets don't have pet insurance like humans do...get pet insurance it's worth it. We did.<//Review>< response>

<text>Do not go to this vet, very unprofessional and unethical. I went in with my dog to see Dr. Rankin, the oncologist there at Sage. I went in to have a mass examined that was discovered during a dental cleaning. I was scheduled an appointment with Dr. Rankin. No one asked if I had any biopsy or test results. I later found out that is standard to have for accurate diagnosis from another vet professional. I wish I had been informed.

Dr. Rankin took my dog back for five minutes, said my dog wouldn't allow her to see the oral mass then preceded to tell me it was most likely a malignant melonoma based on her age but would need a biopsy that would cost $1200. She then went on for ten minutes telling me all the procedures for that treatment, radiation, CT scan. I was devastated and left the office crying. I paid $160 to be given that misinformation.

I went to Banfield to get a biopsy which cost me a little over $500. Turns out it was not that type of cancer and that it is not usually one that is metastatic. I emailed them office asking for a prognosis based on the biopsy. They wanted to charge me for a recheck, which doesn't even make sense since Dr.Rankin had the biopsy. I was told that the doctor would review the biopsy. She didn't. Or at least I never received any email. Dr. Rankin didn't follow up with my vet at Banfield. My vet at Banfield contacted Dr. Rankin.

I called and talked to Jeremy, the office manager who was suppose to look into the situation and follow up. I contacted him when I didn't hear back, three weeks later.

Apparently, he missed the minor detail that Sage was sending emails to the wrong address. This is totally unacceptable, especially considering we had prior emails that went thru to the correct email. Jeremy wrote me a defensive email stating dates they gave me information, which I never received. I told him that. In the letter it stated I was no longer welcome to have my pet treated at Sage, and said I stated non factual information about Dr. Rankin. Why would I take my pet back to Sage after this horrible and unprofessional treatment?

I called again, and spoke to Weldon an office supervisor and he found the error with the incorrect email. Weldon said he wanted to create a report of the whole incident to the medical director as he acknowledged it was wrong. He assured me he would bring this up to the medical director.

Two days after talking with Weldon who admitted error on their part, I got an inappropriate, and at best rude letter certified mail stating they would not be treating my pet and notes made up from the Dr. Rankin.

To clarify, Sage sent information to a wrong email  and admitted it was sent to the wrong email. I was told I would no longer be able to have my pets treated at Sage certified mail after being told my complaint was going to the medical board. Weldon, the office supervisor, admitted fault for the carelessness of the admin then refused to talk to me.

Honestly, all I wanted was an explanation and maybe an apology.
-I paid $160, for 15 minutes of misinformation, with no follow up
-Sage sent information to the wrong email
-Sage asked for a recheck fee to review the biopsy for the appointment I paid for during which I received a misinformational guess of my dog's tumor.
-Sage's staff accused me of stating 'non-factual information' about Dr. Rankin, as I said she spent 10 minutes telling me about treatment plans for a probable an aggressive melonoma. I never said it was a diagnosis.
-Sage's supervisor admitted to the email address error, told me he was going to create a report to the medical supervisor and for days later refused to speak to me.

This is the whole truth, I don't want anyone to go through what I went through. I am so angry that people like this are practicing professionals. People need to know the truth.< /text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x808fec6bd7a447cd:0x2e668258d43d7700<//gmap_id></record>

If your pet has to stay over night they have no problem with Visting. Just as a heads up if your going in after midnight give them a call so they know your coming most of the time they will be waiting at the front door for you . Expect a higher bill then the normal vet as this is emergancy care. Will not hesitate to go to sage if the need ever comes up again .< /Text>< pics>

Would rather come here instead. Its smaller but you find what you need and the availability is great. The testers are nicely set up and aren't all broken or missing. The brow bar is nicely set up as well.< /review><user_name>Angel Ramirez</user_name>< gmapID>

Good store. Most staff friendly. But, I had a JCPenney clothing bag and I assumed you could put your makeup in it, but that's not the case.  The manager came over and told me you couldn't, made feel very uncomfortable. I asked if she'd like to check it, she said no. I was with a friend, my friend had a sephora bag, we didn't put our stuff together as we were gonna pay separately. After that, they eyed us, so we left, as we did not feel comfortable buying at all. We also had a poor experience at the Sephora  upstairs. They seemed to be eyeing us as well. Like, I'm not sure if they called the one upstairs to 'watch out' for us. But, I'm never going back.  I normally go to ulta anyways.</Text>

Don’t get me wrong I like Sephora. I hate this location. Came here on a weekend and the store was a zoo! So packed and what bothers me was they ran out of everything and the samples are disgusting! Like super gross. The lipstick are all smashed up, with hair or fur on it and look like they’ve been thru the devils lips and back to earth. Ewww! When it’s super busy no staff will ask you if you need help and you have to track one down. I’m only gonna order online now.< /text>

<review>NEVER EVER EVER EVER COMING BACK HERE!!!!!
I never buy from Sephora not even online ! Only place I buy my make up is inside Macy’s (fashion valley). I wanted to try it To check out if they had more brands. I went yesterday 01/06/2018 around 3-5pm their where some employees just walking, anyways I ask this old saggy lady she had really blond hair and curls her face looked like a cake ! She look like she had Botox but you know the ones that look that they have Botox can’t help the face anymore type of lady! I asked her nicely can someone check my face to match she said rudely you need to wait 40 min because they are 3 people in front of you . I said okay never mind I will go somewhere else she roll her eyes and walk away didn’t even say a word. You expect to sell and have clients ! BE NICE! You know what I think Sephora has a lot of customers so they don’t give 2 F**** who comes and goes ! NEVER EVER COMING BACK!!!! Any Sephora TO Be HONEST!!!!</review><resp>None< /resp>< Name>

<review>Excellent Customer Service and large selection of products. From CBD and Kratom to hookah and incense, the prices are decent, and the staff is top notch. They are always willing to take the time to explain their products and help you decide what works best for you. Shout out to Ivan who is always awesome and full of information!< /review><name>Naty Lopez<//name></record></dataset><record>

If I could give this location a negative star I would. I went in to buy a bowl piece and maybe but butane for my torch. Never agreed on purchasing the butane and the e player filled my torch without telling me I would have to buy it. He tricked me into buying it and refused to give me my products. Please have this employee trained again and I will be contacting BBB.</Text>

I came here a few days ago and I was amazed at how much different products they have. I was only there to buy a vape pen battery. They must have had 7 different ones at least. I was able to get $20 one that I have been using and enjoying. The guy at the shop open the package to make sure the battery was not in need of charging. He was nice and went out of his way to give me full attention and assist me completely. I walked out of there happy as can be. I am still happy that I had to write this review.</Review>

They don’t give refunds even on faulty products. I asked why was I given a receipt and the woman just shrugged. Wasn’t even 24 hours from purchase. This is a small town with small town values. If you’re gonna set up shop here you should at least adopt the culture.</Text>

This is a little shop, and while they had basically what I needed, there wasn't much selection and the clerk didn't speak English so acquiring what I came to get was a little more difficult and didn't allow me to ask questions.</text>

First time here and it is a great experience so far! Washers and dryers work properly and the attendant was kind, courteous, helpful! There are wall outlets for charging phones and convenient tables near them. Return? Of course!!< /review>

<Text>Very clean stainless steel machines. The large dryers are amazing. To bad it's a little pricy to wash but, it's a fairly newly opened. These machines are cleaned around the clock and with security walking around you can feel a little safe. Be careful for little kids because there is two entrances. So keep a eye on your child. This strip mall gets pretty busy</Text>< Pics>

Everything is good, but I have to dock a star because  I'm not being racist, but I just can't stand sometimes we are there they would put Mexican channel on, and like it's a diverse place come on put on something everyone can watch at least the news or something everyone can understand..besides that service is great.<//Text>

This laundry mat is clean but the area is terrible. There's drunks and homeless people right outside the door drinking alcohol and begging for money. I felt very uncomfortable walking in and out of this place. And Im shocked the employee that worked there didn't run those guys off. !!! I don't know if I would go back!!</Review>

< Review>
Bagels were good and they cut them for me, both the workers were very nice, but maybe i got there late but around 10 am only about 12 bagels there. They are very soft consistency, kinda like croissant. Doesn't really look like they have a kitchen so i took bagel's home. They don't sell by the dozen or cheaper for half a dozen, which sucks<//Review>

Way too expensive for not the same quality I used to remember. Was very disappointed in everything. I won't be going back again. So sad. & guys working there acted as I was bugging them. 1bagel 2 sandwiches come to $20.00 & gross all 3 items. No thanks.</text>

Bagel Time is the best bagel shop in downtown Sacramento.  The bagels are warm, tasty, and not overwhelmingly bready.  Prices are good, and the breakfast sandwiches are delicious.  The customer service is consistently solid.<//review>

The lady that runs the shop or I should say the owner I assume is so kind and genuine. I witnessed her day after day taking care of and helping a man with mental issues and homelessness obviously but normally you see people show them away and this lady made sure he was taking care of didn't let him go hungry you should go here just for the simple fact that they're kind and treat people with respect. But also their bagels are amazing. Try the BLT</review>

<text>I love this place! I came across bagel time when I worked for a company that affiliated themselves with farmers markets which happened to be going on at the park across the street. Service is sweet an quick, small staff cozy kitchen like feeling cafe with amazing homemade products from bagels to muffins an pastries. I go there for their breakfast sandwich with bagel of choice. Awesome staff. I'd go here everyday if only my tastebuds can last that long.<//text>< userid>

I'm glad they moved the coffee station but the navy blue walls (the place just looks cheap with hd tv screens on the wall)??? I just don't understand how hard it is to order an avocado and cheese bagel and add salmon. And they put hard avocado on my sandwhich  so now its just cheese and salmon. so annoyed</text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Nice area for garden shows sales and meetings. Paid parking a bummer but a nice walk to the venue once you find parking elsewhere on the street. Public transportation available. Park setting beautiful<//text>

<review>The food here is exquisite. Not only that, the server, the ambience, everything is top notch. Me and my husband both loved it. We ordered basil fried rice, noodles with duck, and whole fish fry with three sauces. While we absolutely loved the fish and the fried rice, compared to them duck was average. If you are in that area, definitely pay them a visit. The price is perfect compared to the taste. Oh don’t forget the Mango thai tea!< /review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOFLoYOkYE8bv8Jph1h2vfNhTFgDrTkQIYbU69_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO2wnt1_oygtBmN3owKZ5xEbQXBY1KI8BxADzK4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNrqKxrvA1ZE60wzTTeaiOTIWYZB6Y3KAaq8S9k=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPti5ZaZOV1CVdmvUaUXTTgiqhVF1bOEkxIRaar=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNYVLFvC42C-bbHmoRMAnS7Ksa93BNubPORb9jw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNraVk6DlmQUMS8TTjy6pME07CumezYMfaKykkA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

<Review>My friend and I found this place on line and were happy we did. The decor is lovely, the wait staff was dressed in pink Thai outfits and were friendly. We really liked the yellow curry (except for a huge chunk of onion, maybe too many onions and needs more potatoes) and loved the mango rice dessert.< /Review><gmap_id>0x80d954c2b14ad255:0xa331764b2cfcda0f< /gmap_id>< time>

<review>The to-go order is fast and efficient. Truly recommend the Thai Shrimp salad. It is pretty much the same taste I tasted in Bangkok. You can choose your level of spice. Great!< /review>< user>

<review>Very delicious and authentic Thai food! You can order any dish spicy and they will also bring extra spices and a house red pepper jalapeno sauce on the side. The staff was all very friendly and attentive to everyone's drinks and food needs.< /review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN1LSc4aeeZiPTpTt9T-46CnU0hzqJqKLgUFbe7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< Rate>

< Review>
Great for vegetarians - they have an entire vegetarian section of the menu. I ordered the fried tofu (which was perfectly crispy) and fresh spring rolls (nice amount of mint and tofu with a good peanut sauce). Those two things were definitely large enough serving sizes that they could have served as my entree. But I also ordered Ka Prou Tofu - nicely spiced for a mild dish, not overly sauced.< /Review>

tasted really good, not overly seasoned. I liked how they had a lot of noodle options for each dish; was very tempted to go for the glass noodles in the pad se ew but decided ultimately to go with narrow rice noodles. Tried the drunken noodle too.<//text>

My sister ordered a red curry which was good, a panang curry which was good, and a pineapple fried rice which had a very strong cinnamon spice flavor (mehhh). My brother ordered there most popular soup and it was a coconut flavor but very sour.<//review>

One of my preferred locations for thai food. Everyone at our table was quite pleased. The service was sociable and attentive. Feels similar to a cafe in Chicago I liked.</text>

My current favorite Thai in San Diego. Everything is so fresh. Lots of care to make the dishes as beautiful as they are delicious. Don't order spicy unless you're ready for it. I got Larb spicy 7, each bite was as hot as a habanero. Legit.< /review>

This place was great !! We were here just prior to Halloween, place was decked out, big on Harry Potter theme.
Service was great always a full glass of water, they came over to check on us often.
Food came out quickly and was really good, I mean REALLY good! Had a great time here, we would definitely come back if in the area.<//text>

It was just okay.  I honestly expected more from Thai Americans in SD.

There were a number of exotic dishes that I have not tried in NYC or in LA. So I ordered an exotic curry dish with two traditional ones, tom yum soup and basil egg plant with chicken. All of them had slightly subpar taste. The soup was too sour; the basil chicken had two imperfections: the meat tasted old and the sauce lacked flavor. The exotic dish was okay but not very impressive.

I would not recommend this restaurant to my foodie friends in NYC or in LA.</text>

We ordered through Grubhub and had it delivered to the lobby of our hotel in Old Town. First time trying this place. They had plenty of vegetarian options. My wife and I ordered the Rama with chicken and the spicy noodles with chicken. The Rama had a delicious peanut sauce! Love that they seem to use high quality ingredients. The food arrived quickly, and it was still hot and fresh.<//Review>

The food was divine! I do not think I have had better Thai food in my life. This is a little more towards the high end but worth every penny. As well, the wine selection was decent and not over priced. Our server however, needs lots of work. Hr forgot our appetizer order as well as unfamiliar with the wine list or how to pour it. My second glass of wine he brought in a small glass andnpoured it on top of my old glass? Not sure what that was? Service 0 food 100.< /review>

Came here with a group of 2. Was easily seated. No wait time.

For appetizers, tried the fried dumplings and Shrimp Thai wrap. The fried dumplings were pretty good. Nice balance between the flour/dough and the amount of meat you get. The Shrimp Thai wrap was underwhelming. They needed to either put in more shrimp or use a bigger size shrimp. The dish was not balanced at all and all you really eat are the vegetables. The cucumber slices were too thick. If they want to use the same amount, cut it into 2 or 3 slices.

I got the minced pork with basil with brown rice. I really wanted to like this dish but it was overly salty. The plating of this dish was excellent.

I was also able to try the Crying Tiger dish. The angus steak was incredibly dry and tough. I wouldn't recommend this dish. The plating of the food was also excellent and beautiful though.

For dessert, had the FBI. This was amazing. A great balance between ice cream and fried bananas. The honey worked well, it wasn't overly sweet. The peanuts added crunch/texture to the dish which was needed and I think they made something in the dish mildly spicy which was awesome. This was a very complete dish.  If all I had was this dish, the place would have gotten 4 stars.

The restaurant definitely has potential to put out great stuff. Perhaps I was unlucky on 4 randomly selected dishes but I may come back next time to try the curry which I've heard great things about.

Service was excellent and staff was friendly.  One thing to note is that the staff sometimes have "blinders" on. They focus on one request at a time and sometimes don't multi-task well.<//review>

This place was great. I ordered the red curry and drunken noodles and they were amazing. The attention to detail was on point with both their service and venue decor. I will certainly be going back.< /Review>

Cozy warm and inviting place. Very nice staff.  The food is unique or as traditional as you please and high quality too.  The table settings are beautiful.  The surrounding area is a quaint area of San Diego filled with restaurants and way overpriced ancient homes.  Who wants to pay 1.4 million to live by a Zoo in an 80 year old grandma house?  No way. But the food here is not overpriced.  It's easy to feed four for 100 or less.  Try THAT in downtown San Diego... Ain't happnin yo. Especially at any classy place. So take your friends and date to Amarin and you won't be sorry.<//review>

Excellent food that includes a number of gluten free items. I brought my dad, who isn't the most adventurous when it comes to food, here once and not only did he love it but he bought their cookbook that was displayed and still makes recipes out of it years later. One of my favorites is the yellow curry with shrimp. They also make a delicious peanut sauce. It's a regular place for any birthdays in special occasions in my family. They also really get into holidays with decorations and special menu items.<//review>

<Rating>3</Rating><text>We were severely disappointed with our experience this time at Amarin. We have been there multiple times and it was always great. We ordered our standard dish of See Ew and it came out flavorless and with almost no sauce. We told them about it and the server remade my wife's dish.

We will go back eventually but hope Amarin returns to the high standards we have had from them in the past.<//text>< name>

I really really wanted to like this restaurant so much after seeing the reviews and today being New Year's Eve.

Food - Below average . I would give no more than 2.5 stars and that's a stretch.
Service - I would give it a 0 if I could.
Ambience - Was very good. I would give it a 4-5 stars.

Again, going by the reviews, and seeing the live wait times between 15-30 mins, we decided to join the waitlist through Yelp, so we could save time.
We reached the restaurant exactly 30 mins later and mentioned that we checked in online.
The host made a face and walked away saying he'll come back. We could guess from his expression that their system was probably down and so it was obvious he wouldn't be able to find us on the wait list. Although the good thing is, he came back almost immediately and seated us. But instead of leaving us be to settle down, he lectured me about calling next time even if I used an online checkin. First of all, I have never ever called any restaurant after checkin online and have never had issues. Second of all, the tone of the host was so condescending that I was shocked. He went so far as to tell us that just because we were lucky we got a table.

We placed our drinks and main course orders together. I had  a question, to which I received a very rude answer. By this point, he had already ruined my mood.

Food arrived. Wine was pretty good. Drunken noodles were very spicy. This coming from an Indian! Red curry was underwhelming to say the least. Not much flavor at all. I have definitely had better.

Throughout the meal, no one came by to check for drink refills, neither did anyone check to see if everything was okay with our food. All the while I saw this being done at other tables around me.
I was just waiting to get out of there.
Although we wanted to eat desserts, we decided not to stay there for any more time than necessary and got the hell out.

Very very disappointed and needless to say, will never go back.<//text>

<review>The flavors are almost there but the balance is off. Coming from having had quite a bit of authentic Thai food you can tell this place is authentic but they’ve dumbed down a lot of their food to not have that salty spicy sweet balance that Thai is often known for. Medium = very mild and hot = barely medium (and I don’t like typically very hot foods) so don’t be afraid to order hot here (maybe it was just the day or the weekend lunch chef).<//review>< resp>

AMAZING food and great service. Just be careful, when they say spicy they mean SPICY! Almost every dish on the menu can be made modified for vegetarians. Prices are very reasonable. The ingredients are fresh, presentation is pleasant, great environment, the dining room is usually decorated on holidays. One of my favorite restaurants in SD.<//Text>

This is our favorite Thai restaurant in San Diego, we go probably 2-3x per month. Yes, there are others that are very good, but the food is always very fresh and well cooked and consistent. The staff is nice and there is little turnover, which says a lot about the management. I couldn't recommend this place enough!<//text>

<Review>I have been eating at Amarin for years. The good is delicious, the decor is clean and attractive, the prices are fair and the staff is accommodating. They creatively change their menu from time to time and I have had the chance to enjoy a variety of their food.  My only negative is that they do not have paper towels in the restroom. So when you use the facilities and wash your hands there is only a blower to dry them and then you are using your clean hands to open a germy door. If they had paper towels one could dry their hands and use the towel to open the restroom door.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

Extremely nasty and inappropriate behavior of restaurant personnel. They are rude and don’t have any idea about customer service. Portions are kept to the minimum and are poor in flavor.<//text>

My favorite Thai place in SD. Food is always spot on and the staff is always very friendly. Truthfully, I usually do take out because they are super quick about it and I like having leftovers, but the inside space is nice for dining out and great for groups. Parking can be tough during busy times but it's not impossible. I usually get the red curry and yellow curry with chicken. Their rolls are awesome too.</Text>

<text>Tasty and classy place for delicious Thai food, that won't break the bank!

Amarin is behind the Alibi in Hillcrest (have you seen the "Before I Die" chalkboard? It's right there!). They have a cozy build out with a mix of indoor and outdoor seating.

The menu has MANY options, and there's a different menu for lunch and dinner. Food is prepared well, and service is excellent.

PROPS: Awesome spot for great Thai food. Also, the outdoor patio is dog friendly!
SLOPS: It's a small spot that can get busy very quickly. Also, no beer on draft. Just bottles.<//text>< pics>

Can't go wrong with Thai food. I've never been to a bad Thai Restaurant. Compared to other Thai restaurants, this is one of the best. Great for that special lunch or dinner. Perfect place to impress a date or to celebrate a special occasion.< /review>

Beyond excellent taste..the female boss is a very strong woman with a golden heart that knows how to treat humanity!

Pumpkin curry was delicious served in a kabocha squash. Drunken noodle also delicious without being oily or burned. Vegetarian soup was excellent. Vegetables were fresh, not over cooked. They don't skimp on veggies either. The server was very attentive, helped me navigate the menu safely even with a serious shellfish allergy. The presentation of every dish was beautiful. This is one of the very best Thai restaurants I have been to out of many different places in California, Colorado, and elsewhere.< /Text>

Pleasant atmosphere and service.  Dishes were made with care, and tasty.  We asked for very spicy, but the heat was not enough.  Problem solved by asking for the spice rack and adding more heat to taste.< /Review>

Innovative menu. The chef has a cookbook for sale. There are items available at this restaurant that you won't find at a typical Thai restaurant. Kudos to the chef for creativity and delicious blend of flavors. Amarin Fish is amazing. All curries are good. Also, having the the option of brown rice is a nice touch for those who want healthy alternatives.Would love to have the Tom Kah less sweet with a little hot spice. But it's still delicious the way they make it.  See you soon as this is a regular favorite of ours.</Review>

Food is amazing (5/5 stars). Service is amateurish (1/5). Sat down and waited for the waiter to come. After 20min of waiting, we finally signaled for one. Where's the standard ask for drinks first service? Once we ordered food, it took another 30min wait. They didn't have what I wanted and when I asked what the recommendation, the server gave me an attitude and said "I don't know what you want." Usually, when I ask for a recommendation, a great server would be quick to give one. Used a Groupon coupon to pay for food and one of the servers who took our payment, gave an attitude. Would never go back here again. I can get great food somewhere else that has better level of service.<//text>

When I lived near by I would come here a couple times a week for various curries, but now I probably only make it in once every couple of months. Still worth making it over. I don't like Pad Thai most anywhere else, but at Amarin, it's delicious.</review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Best late night Thai in the area- open until 2am on the weekends, you really can't beat that. Parking is a pain though, best of luck on finding one.

Their top dishes are the Pad Thai, Tom Yum soup, and Massaman beef curry. Be very very careful on the spice levels, they really overdo it. Prices are pretty standard in this location- personally I think it's pricey.

They have amazing lunch specials- I'd recommend giving them a try during then.< /review>

Great Thai restaurant! 3 Musketeers and Cha Cha Cha are my favorites, but can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Friendly staff. Hit or miss as far as crowd - some nights there's a wait, so nights it's almost empty.</Text>

Excellent Thai restaurant which is a notch above most Thai places in terms of the physical restaurant (white tablecloths, large wine selection, outdoor and indoor dining options, etc.) and in addition and most importantly, has excellent food and many choices. The food is also a notch above others in terms of quality and variations on the menu.<//review>

Amarin Thai is one of the oldest Thai places in town but it seems to have become complacent lately.
Chicken in the curry was overcooked and the noodles had too much vinegar. Overall a passable lunch but don't think I would go back any time soon.<//review>

Cold inside. Looks like if you don't have a reservation you should be prepared for a long wait. If your food isn't spicy enough, ask for some spices and you can add to the hotness yourself.

Pad Thai and Panang chicken curry are delicious.<//text>

Amarin Thai is one of the oldest Thai places in town but it seems to have become complacent lately.
Chicken in the curry was overcooked and the noodles had too much vinegar. Overall a passable lunch but don't think I would go back any time soon.</text>

Had ubereat delivered without any utensils nor napkins for taking out. I stayed at hotel that didn't have utensils either and it was late at night; how am I supposed to eat?! The salmon salad was terrible and stink. It smelled like dead fish. The salmon wasn't cooked. Had to throw away more than half. The only good thing is tom yum soup. I normally don't give bad review but it was just so bad.</review>

I wish I had taken pictures of the food here! My gf, her family, and I had lunch here after walking Balboa park...the food tasted amazing as did the thai tea...I would recommend the duck any day of the week! Staff was friendly and well versed in Thai and the prices were good...</Text>

<rating>5</rating><Review>I'm sort of new to this whole Thai thing. I've probably only tried a handful of Thai places in S.D. However, Amarin is the place I compare them all too.

This place has some damn tasty Thai. Yellow curry....red curry....pad thai...it doesn't matter. Everything I've tried is pretty damn good. This is actually the place where I lost my Thai virginity, so I'm not sure if that has anything to do with my biased opinion. Nevertheless, this is my go to spot.</Review>< Pictures>

This food made me so sick! The sickest I've been in a long time. The food tasted mediocre, and it wasn't even warm. We got the Thai steak, potak soup, shrimp rolls, and rice. In the mood for Thai? Go somewhere else. You won't find anything here.</text>

< Review>
It was a late night after the balboa park and we were starving. I went online and looked at their hours and it displayed that they were still open for another hour. We had a difficult time finding street parking but when we did, they wouldn't serve us because they said the kitchen was closed. They still had lots of customers at the tables eating.< /Review>

<Review>the food was just okay I ordered salmon but I thought it tasted a little fishy so it wasn't as good as I thought it would be but the ambience of the room was okay but then the waitress just left us there and never came back for like 30 or 40 minutes and I had to get up and pay my bill and they didn't even care so I didn't tip them but their food is probably good maybe just for takeout</Review><user_id>101247276546610505571< /user_id><Response>None<//Response>< rate>

<Review>My wife and I decided to eat out on a Monday recently in the middle of the horrible hot weather we've been having.We decided it was time to try this Thai place.It was nice and cool inside that's for sure.We enjoyed some tasty starters such as Thai fish cakes and shrimp wraps while waiting for our mains.As with most Asian restaurants the beer choice was extremely limited so I settled for a Red Trolley.We decided on Choo-Chi Salmon and Cha Cha Cha ( a pork dish) for dinner.Our meals arrived in a short time and were very well presented and smelled delicious.A server named Kui looked after us during our visit and did a good job of explaining the menu choice to us.My wife and I enjoyed everything we ordered and look forward to returning another evening.<//Review>< Pictures>

Awful! I love Thai food & typically eat at Bahn Thai. But I tried out UberEATS for the first time last night & ordered the Thai fried rice. It was nothing compared to Bahn Thai but ate it anyways . I had to call out of work today and have been throwing up all day can't keep anything down & am sweating so bad. I will recommend to everyone to never go here. Please share if you got sick from Amarin too so maybe it is widespread food poisoning? I'm a very nice person who typically writes nice reviews but this one I just had to do. I haven't felt this sick from food poisoning in a long time. Unless the Uber guy poisoned my food... he didn't even come to my door.. I was suprised because postmates comes to your door. He texted me to come out to his car. I thought that was odd. Anyways I'm putting the phone down now because I feel like I'm going to vomit again ; ((((<//Review>

I have given this place many chances, but the food is lacking on taste every time. I and my friends find it bland and very sub-par, especially compared to the other Thai food alternatives near by. The ambiance and service however, are very good, hence two stars.< /Text>

<rate>4< /rate><Text>My absolute favorite Thai restaurant in San Diego. I have been coming here since the first day a friend had introduced me (going on three years now). Good prices, nice decor, fast, open late, and they even take call aheads! Love it! I work downtown and on a weekly basis order out for lunch. They have great lunch prices for between $6.95-$8 you get it all - e.g., curry, rice, soup, an egg roll, and a fried dumpling. Their yellow chicken curry, beef pad sei ew (absolutely spelled wrong), and pork thai fried rice are my favorites here. And those days where i want to just gorge, i also order the love boat - a sampler of chicken stay, egg roll, golden triangle and much more. Highly recommended. Also not to mention at taste of hillcrest they were The Restaurant that really gave it their all and welcomed people by offering a lot more samples - mango rice, chicken satay, friend shrimp with mango salsa and a golden triangle.< /Text><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

<Time>1388833360036< /Time><rating>1<//rating><review>And so I have to say "no thanks" to amarin Thai. I sat down to a nice bowl the best Thom kha Kai in Sd. Only to be berated by some sad white washed "asian" dude prying at me via his "Hawaiian friend". When I told him that " not all Hawaiians know each-other nor are related. he proceeded to tell me to "calm down".  And when I snapped at his unaware xenophobic comment an opinionated white girl chimed in and needed less to say that was it... then the staff said " we need to call police". To which know one protested. But every white male decided that he ought to become a bass in the choir. I thought amarin was the best "Thai food" in town, it still may be. Thought it's not a place for white people to stand up for other people, after years of imperialism and genocide. I'm glad you went to college and learned about "world" history. And now you can feel better about going because you can brow beat it's customers into shame.......

From a chef,

Everything about this place is above average, the food, the staff, and the restraunt itself.  Pricing is right where it should be for the delivery.< /Review>

<Review>The food is amazing but there's this one guy who always gets the order wrong when we pay, been here 5 times and it was wrong every time, always more expensive then what we actually paid for, don't ever leave this place with making sure your receipt is proper.< /Review>< Rate>

Low budget, no parking hole in the wall, 2 stars only because friends chose the place. Staff is not attentive to the point of ignoring your request for another tea bag.</review>
