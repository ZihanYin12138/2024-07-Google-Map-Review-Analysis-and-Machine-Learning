I had a tire blowout going “highway speed” and I’m confident without Rolloface brakes I would have rolled.  I stopped rapidly and safely.

I’ve had my brake kit for almost 2 years now, and I get so many compliments on them. They were direct bolt on, and fit perfectly. The kit came complete with everything needed, so you don’t have to worry about buying anything except for new brake fluid. The customer support is top notch, and very easy to work with.

I am very happy with my purchase and have recommended Rolloface to several friends of mine.<//review>

Rolloface has a great product and has excellent customer service! Everything came very nicely packaged and very secure to ensure no damages would occur. The powder coating looked top notch and the assembly looked flawless! Everything bolted right up and fit just as advertised. I’m extremely happy with this product and highly recommend  their products.<//review>

Amazing company to work with they made the drive to Arizona to take measurements of my truck. The quality of the breaks for my C10 where one best I’ve seen in the market. They kept me informed of the process, the communication was great. It’s hard to find that kind of service now and days. Highly recommend this company you won’t be disappointed.

<Text>Professional people here, fast responders, very detailed. No problem communicating. I got my order, and it got to me a good time. No fitment problems. No chipping or signs of aging, I’ve had rolloface big brake kit on my daily driven 09’ Toyota Camry for almost a year, Car has been through winter weather, muddy paths. Deep puddles, my brakes always come in clutch in nasty situations. It looks beautiful and it’s a big upgrade in stopping power, so thank you for keeping me and my family safe while looking great rolling down the road. You’ve got my business for the long run. I hope anyone reading this will consider getting yourself a brake kit, look good and stay safe. Rolloface has done good by me. Let them do the same by you.<//Text>< pics>

<text>ROLLOFACE is a very very good company/product! With great quality & customer service. They no only look amazing but perform amazing as well! I would recommend them to anyone one of my fellow car enthusiasts. It’s a shame that people will come out a negative review here without purchasing or using this product because of 1 person’s experience...</text>< user_id>

I bought a 356mm Big Brake Kit for my 2015 Subaru Legacy 3.6r in 2016 or 2017 for my Daily Driver/Show Car and I was impressed the stopping power I have with the bigger brakes is excellent.  I have more than 100k miles on my Brake Kit and still perform like New.. The Rotors Definitely last a long time and haven't shown any signs of warping.. I totally recommend there products to anyone who are looking to upgrade.</text>

I ordered brakes from Rolloface for my Lexus IS350.  I waited a few weeks for assembly and when I recieved them they were worth the wait.  I ordered a blue finish on mine.  The craftsmanship and overall aesthetics are amazing.  Def a much needed accent on any car.< /review>

Make sure you check the warranty before you buy don’t make the mistake of trusting this company! The customer service is atrocious and they even threatened you for legal action for calling them out on it! They also block you on social media 😂 super professional.<//text>

Customer service is A1. They’ll work with you on getting the perfect measurement and can choose from thousands of colors. The quality of there work is top tier. Something to keep in mind. If you cant afford the maintenance of a big break kit. Keep your stocks and spray paint them. This game is for men not little boys.< /Text>

<review>Absolutely the best BBK EVER!! Excellent customer service and remarkable product. I have had my brakes for 2 years now absolutely NO issue with the originalbeautiful powder coating they still look brand new! I giggle when I see other brands in comparison to the size quality and look of Rolloface calipers and rotors! I love that I got to customize all aspects of my brakes. The team at Rolloface are very knowledgeable and
helpful with fitment as well.< /review>< pics>

I would have been in bad accidents if I didn’t have these. As for customer service, I had an issue with my brake lines and the company dropped off a replacement set within days of being notified of the issue. Like literally came to my house.

<review>Considering most of the negative reviews were written by children who have not even purchased a kit, or are just here for drama I will be happy to leave a real review by someone who has had a Kit for over 4 years with ZERO issues.
Ken has always provided the best service, best optioned product on the market... Performance wise it does what it claims and looks very good doing it. I had my kit on my VW and after 4 years of use I pulled it and sent it back to Rolloface to have it refinished so I can use it on my Audi, Ken noticed some issues with a threaded port that was damaged  BY ME, and he fixed it.... YES I was charged BUT he had my Safety in mind and let me know. He could have easily just re finished the calipers and sent them back to and let me roll the dice if the brakes would leak. No, it was worth the extra charge to have it done right. My kit was done in a timely manner and came back to me good as new. I would stake my life on this product and I do, its on my car that I drive with my children. You cannot get the level of service from "big name companies" that Ken provides. I trust Ken and the team at Rolloface....< /review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOELK4yaI8A7N-RyzhuWbOWfDy3p3V3lk_nMMs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< Resp>

The experience that I had with Rollo Face helped take my build to another level... the color matching was superior. I don't think the color rose gold was as popular as it is now but I see several packages now being mantled thanks rollo face for even when I needed a touch up you gladly did it no charge.< /text>

I own a 2011 BMW Z4 E89 and have been using the Rolloface BBK for the front and back for close to 2 years.  The breaks work fantastic better than the bmw stock. I have had no issues and am always getting compliments in car shows.  When I first had them installed I polished and ceramic coated them. The still look like new. I only use non abrasive soap and water.  Same I use when I wash my car. Adams Car Shampoo. The calipers are powder coated with Prismatic Powders Peeka Blue. Love these breaks and will continue to use Rolloface for any future builds.<//text>

Really glad I went with Rolloface BBKs for my car. I was able to customize the calipers as well as the rotors. Each question/concerns I had prior to purchasing were addressed without any expectations to commit by their great customer service. After two years of daily driving with them on, braking performance is still as good as when I first got them.<//text>

<text>Rolloface has conducted great service for me. I recently bought a big brake kit for my 94 r32 GTR, and I had got into accident unfortunately. I contacted rolloface and gave them the whole spill, and they set me up with new specs for my 03 350z I currently have. All I had to do was spend back the old rotors and they made new ones for my 350z and sent them right back to me.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x80c2d80c2e079359:0x5fdded8e543558a9<//gmap_id></record>

Terrible quality and quick color peeling. Seems like a small company should be more concerned about quality. Braking quality poor. Color poor. Coating poor. Poor company. Go elsewhere for this type of money< /review>

LOVE MY BBK! This is a REAL REVIEW by someone that was actually sponsored by Rolloface and purchased the kit! Almost all of these negative reviews are bogus and these people have not even purchased the brakes. Please disregard them. I have had my beautiful candy purple set for my Acura TSX since 2017 and I absolutely love them. I get so many compliments on them at car shows and I do not regret my purchase at all. I have had many friends also purchase sets for their show cars and never had any issues. Ken had always helped me with any questions I’ve ever had about replacing the pads etc. I would definitely buy another set for my next car! Team Rolloface!<//text>

Wish i could leave 0 Stars. for a 2K+ brake setup, the functional quality, the build quality and customer support has to be top notch. their calipers paint doesnt last 2 years, and when approached for customer support, they threaten with legal action, and block the customer off social media platforms trying to shut the customer down. i had brembos on my 2011 WRX for 3 years and the paint never peeled off or faded. if you like throwing money away, buy from Rolloface. otherwise, id highly recommend another brand/company. DONT BE FOOLED BY FAKE REVIEWS.</Review>

<user_name>Akin Sells<//user_name><review>BiG stopping power, stunning looks, for half the price of the big names! I upgraded my factory Brembo brakes on my Porsche GT3 to Rolloface Big Brake kit with race pads and stainless steel hoses and I have gained confidence in driving my car again. The stock brakes start fading after 3-5 hard brakes and become mushy and unresponsive. Rolloface BBK stops the car instantly which in return gives me more reaction time. On the track, the later you have to apply the brakes, the more seconds you shave off your turn times. I have had these brakes on my car for 4 years now and they still look like amazing works of art. I always get compliments from people and I refer them to my good friends at Rolloface. I love these brakes so much that I have asked them to make a custom set for my Ferrari F430 which has the Brembo brakes with the same brake fade issue. Even though they don’t currently offer a BBK kit for my car, they were very kind and decided to take on the challenge to make me a custom kit. I am super excited and can’t wait to install them on my Ferrari!<//review><UserId.>106388624816205231332</UserId.>< time>

<rating>5<//rating><review>I have owned a set of Rolloface SS series Forged 6 piston front and 4 piston rear brake packages for almost two years now.

Ordering: using Rollofaces website i was able to easily able to find the right package i wanted for my specific vehicle.

Customer service: I reached out to Rolloface because i wanted a specific powder coat color used on my brake calipers to match the lips of my wheels. Rolloface was extremely fast in replying back to me and confirming that they could use the exact same Prismatic powder coat so they would match perfectly.

Product quality/Installation: Upon arrival the packing was extremely nice and the overall quality of the calipers/rotors/etc were as good if not better than the competition! Installation instructions were very well documented so someone like me that is not a professional was able to complete it in a few hours in my driveway.

Performance: These brakes are a MASSIVE improvement in braking response and longevity vs the OEM MK6 GTI brakes. I have tested Brake fade on a mountain run to a portion of where i knew the GTI brakes would start to fade and the Rolloface Brakes would not quit. I ended up not being able to get the brakes to fade during the entire run so for me personally these are perfect.

Long term testing: These brakes have seen a few thousand miles now and still operate and look like the day i installed them! I am extremely happy with Rolloface as a company and their quality Brakes. I will definitely be using them again in my next project.</review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>{'time': 1618604475491, 'text': 'Thanks for your good reviews. Supreme GTi.

Wow.... where do I start... I’m on my second Rollaface BBK on my 2019 VW Tiguan, first was on my 2016 VW Golf R!! The way the brake lamp are manufactured is simply amazing, one would think just cause there made the way you want, 3600 colors to choose from would just be enough but HELL NO!!!! I’ve had personal experience that not only do they look good but they work!!! Blazing 70 miles an hour on the highway feeling my self when an older gentlemen not paying attention turned in front of me and oh man Rollaface BBK allowed my VW to stop on a dime. I would recommend this kit for anyone, anywhere, for any application!!! Go for it you won’t be disappointed!!!💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽</review>

My experience with Rolloface has been awesome.  I purchased my brake kit from Rolloface because I was able to save a little money compared to purchasing the same kind of kit from Brembo or Wilwood.  Also this kit weighs half as much as the OEM setup I replaced. When you have a heavy car like a Challenger,  this kit being lighter was a definate plus.

The Rolloface team really looks out for the customer.
After I chose my brake kit and sent payment,  they actually refunded me some money cause they had to put a smaller size rotor in the kit for the rear.  Turns out the kit i had purchased had a rotor  size that would have put too much brake bias on the rear. If that's not looking out for a customers best interest I don't know what is.

Ive had the kit installed on my car for over 2 years now and still working great.  The customer service I have recieved has been phenomenal.  Ken went over and above in dealing with the logistics of getting my brake kit to me in the midst of a major event weekend.  The ordering process was awesome in the way you get to choose from any color imaginable unlike other companies that only have a handful of color offerings.  The after the sale service and support is great too.  During one of my spirited driving moments one of my calipers got damaged. The brake caliper  held up like a tank  but  some debris that got  up under my car took a chunk out from the corner  of it.  It was only cosmetic damage but I was able to order up another caliper and Rolloface was able to build it and get it out to me in record time for my next event.  I can honestly say too that the performance of these brakes is unbelievable.  For as heavy as my car is, they will stop the car quick.  Saved me from getting caught up in a collision that happened right in front of me.

The only issue I have is that dang air freshener that came with the kit didn't last very long lol.</text>

Rolloface brake kit is amazing... I purchased for my customer in Jakarta, Indonesia for his Toyota Camry 2019 and he is very satisfied.....the seller is very well informative and communication was very smooth too...I can bet that no one in Indonesia has ever purchased the Rolloface brakes....we are the first one who bring it to Indonesia....</text>

Great customer service.  This is my first time bringing my Dyson products to this location.  They were friendly, professional and most importantly quick.

For Covid please beware there is only curbside service.  You pulled up to their curbside, call a number posted in the front and someone will come out to help you.  They took in my machine, do a quick diagnostic, and come back out to tell you what they can do.  The whole process for me was about 45 mins please plan for that.< /Text>

<Review>I went to have my Dyson hand held V8 Absolute looked at today and an estimate was verbally provided to me to repair it.  But the person would not provide the written estimate to me. He said it was company policy not to provide the written estimate if the work is not ordered to be done at that time. In other words I was not able to take the estimate home, review the work description and think about whether I wanted the repairs done.<//Review>< gmap_id>

No appointment needed pull up in the red zone in front of the door (there may be a line of cars) typically 7-10 day turn around for uprights I’m told. If it’s a handheld they may or may not be able to fix it while you wait. It probably depends on how busy they are or how complicated the fix.

I came here to buy my V8 absolute at the black Friday 15% off special early in November great Value worth every expensive bit it cost. The staff is great at answering all the questions and once you purchase it here directly from Dyson your automatically registered for warranty.</Text>

They will only talk to you from your car at the curb, curbside service means exactly that.  If I’m going to spend $700 for a vacuum cleaner I want to touch it a see how it works.  I’ll drive to Orange County, their open for business.  And buy a Dyson or something else, the service center in Santa Fe Springs doesn’t work for me.<//text>< pictures>

Computer indicated office open status.  It was closed! Many people showed up and frustrated that no sign to say closed or when it  will open. Telephone indicated messages can not be recorded as it is full.  Called 866 number in state of Illinois....they were kind and apologetic for confusion.  But not able to get vacuum  fixed or drop off.</text>

< Review>
My V8 Absolute was dropped right out of the box, breaking the cyclone section of the wireless stick vacuum. I never even had the chance to use it before I broke it. I could not even blame someone else as a scape goat.

The technician brought the replacement part into his service center from another location, overnight trying to get me my unit back to me as quickly as possible. Although, these great efforts to return me my unit, the vacuum was not functioning per their standard for my model.   He then replaced the canister. Trying to put it into service he then realized that my battery was not taking a charge nor holding a charge either. He replaced the battery pack. Now, this was the third component that had faultered. However, there was "NO CHARGE" for any of the repairs. I was "floored" to say the least. I told him that I dropped this unit to the floor when it broke.
He said, your job is to use and sometimes abuse our products. It is our job to repair or replace our products for our customers. We do it with pleasure and when we get to see the smiles that appear on your faces. It is simply satisfying.</Review>

This store is conveniently located at corner of Slauson/ santa Fe Springs, near 605 fwy access.  Parking free and access for handicapped friendly. Staff very personable and knowledgeable.  Registration takes less than a couple of minutes.  Louis helped me and took the time to to educate me on things I never knew about my Dyson. He even let me know it was still under warranty.  He also helped me bring in my vacuums from the car.  Michelin service for sure. This will be my forever store.< /text>

<Time>1572973574301</Time><rating>5</rating><text>I owe many dyson products (e.g., several vacuums, hair styler, air purifier, etc) and this was my first time coming in for a service. Nelson was super nice and helpful. Another person who followed up on my service status (can't remember his name..) was also extremely helpful. The problem with my hair styler was fixed within a week which was a lot faster than expected.

Wonderful service - Thank You!</text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x80dd2cdb151f1a69:0xf34c36a999ac7823</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>5</Rating><pictures>None< /pictures><Review>This place is immaculate - it's like a catalog inside! Manny took great care of my vacuum and even gave me some inspirational ideas for the future, all vacuum talk aside. It was comforting: taking my vacuum in for repair and walking out knowing it will always be cared for, as if by  Mr. Dyson himself. Manny is the best. You can tell he puts people first and does everything he can to take care of them - and quick too! Picture this: Mr. Clean meets Mr. Dyson meets your favorite elementary school teacher and perhaps your wise older brother. Bottom line: Manny is the man and this Dyson Service Center is gold.

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>Somehow, our diagnosis for our vacuum got lost in the system and after three weeks, we were frustrated. No one was calling us back. Of course, it's summer so it is also vacation time. I ended up called in Dyson corporate who told me they would ship us a refurbished model and have the service center return our unit. I was happy with that response.

But, I still received a call from the service center a couple days later. They were so apologetic for the mix up and wanted to make sure we had been taken care of. They truly went above and beyond in making up for the mishap.

Great service. It makes me want to buy more Dyson products.< /text>< pictures>

Quick to come to your aid and concerns, take your products back to the technicians and get going on the work, then come out in less than 20 or 30 minutes with every one of the issues resolved and repaired and then some!!

I wish all companies had these guy’s work ethics and service mentality. If you need any service done on your dyson, this is the place. You won’t regret it.< /text>< user_name>

Manny represents Dyson like no other, straight forward, honest, and a superb attitude!! This man truly understands his products and certainly has had a profound effect on my experience with Dyson. If it were up to me, Manuel would be the National Dyson Customer Service Training Mgr. Keep up the fire Manny!!  Doc J</review>

<Text>I brought my Dyson upright here because it stopped working properly. It would only remain ON when I held the power switch on while I vacuumed. It was supposed to be an on/off switch, but hold-it-on switch. Anyway they fixed it with no problem, a minimum labor charge. Later I learned I could have googled the problem and probably fixed it myself for the price of a screw. Live and learn.<//Text><Date>1453478925181< /Date>< userid>

I dropped off my Dyson Upright three weeks ago at this location. When I call to ask about the whereabouts of my vacuum, no one ever answers.  I received an e-mail stating it had been repaired and it was being sent back to me 2 weeks ago..and nothing thus far.  I call the Dyson Corporation and they can't even give me answers.  This is absolutely ridiculous! I will NEVER purchase any Dyson product again!</review>

Manuel was really great. He took my vacuum right in and I was done with repair and new parts in 15 minutes. This new location is much nicer than the old one.</Review>

<Review>The motel is relatively easy to find & parking good. It is ADA accessible. The staff was friendly and fairly efficient. This is an older motel that could use some freshening up. The rooms were clean but showed some wear. Our room was towards the back and reasonably quiet. The on wall heater didn't work but the room had a small electric heater with fan. I found the beds too hard for me, as did my wife. They did have a small continental breakfast but I chose not to partake. A Denny's restaurant was right next door.</Review>< Rating>

Good over hotel for the price. Nothing fancy but does the trick for a close hotel to the airport. Front desk staff were nice. Only big negative is that the breakfast being advertised is really basic. Not worth it for me, went to a restaurant instead.< /Text>

Very quiet, super clean. I appreciate their effort to conserve, but there wasn't any hair cleaning products there. Water is really good. I don't mind where it's located, but the free food isn't that much to brag about. The employees were polite though.</review>

This place is a good choice for the budget conscious.  The motel was upgrading all the room furniture when we arrived, so we stepped out for 15 minutes when the workers were ready to do our room.  The new furniture is a definite upgrade, and the manager told me they would soon be changing their flag to be a Best Western.</Review>

<text>Very dumpy Hotel. The only perk is you can park your car and there's no airport shuttle from the hotel to the airport which is the negative. But being able to park your car for extended period for a cheap rate two thumbs up<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

<Text>Roaches in the bed roaches in the bathroom. I put my drink down for 10 seconds and it was covered in roaches. Manager was very rude and said to my face in front of the roaches those aren't roaches sir. The next room they showed us also full of roaches. Booked for two nights stayed for 10 minutes and was not refunded a dime.< /Text>< pics>

<Review>DO NOT STAY HERE!  Blood on the sheets, mirror,  rug, and blanket.  They offered to move us to a new room but were rude!  We asked for a rate reduction and they refused!  Terrible customer service!  We moved next door to the Comfort Inn.< /Review><Name>Susan Riller< /Name>< pics>

This place is reliably available but has limited appeal beyond that. They've upgraded their TVs but my recent stay found me in a room with a sagging ceiling in the bathroom.
Staff is nice enough.</Text>

<Text>The walls were extremely thin. The other guests were very noisy all night. The breakfast has a horrendous lack of variety (basically only packaged pastries, cereal, and yogurt). And the tv remote would barely let me change the stations. The room was clean at least.</Text>< Pics>

I made reservations here due to its proximity to the airport. The room was dirty, my wife found a pizza crust under the table. The walls had grease on them. It was quiet there, they did have wifi, and it was cheap. That's about it. If we had to be there for more than a few hours sleep, we'd have left.< /Text>

A generally good and conveniently located hotel, with the exception of motion-triggered lighting and funny smelling bathroom. The lights of the room would activate with motion, something not that convenient when your other roommates are sleeping and you have to get up to use the bathroom or something.</Review>

Location and prices are good. There is a 24-hour open diner just in front of the hotel (Denny's), and also there is a 7-eleven market nearby. The light rail is very close and you may use it to go to downtown easily. Beds are comfortable, and the staff is cheerful.

The air circulation of the room was not enough even I have left the the window open. But it was not so disturbing. They have free Wi-Fi, but it has a very slow connection.<//Review>

Great value for the price. Little pricier than others (not much though!) but it's only a couple mins to Uber (or walk) to/from the airport. I needed a new key, and the guy at the desk was very helpful and friendly about it. I needed to extend my stay at the last minute and they were accommodating. They even brought new (warm!) towels and soap to us later that day. No comments about the other staff like the cleaning service, as we did not use those services. They share a parking lot with Denny's which is convenient. Who travels to California and eats at Denny's though?! Take the $40 to a seafood joint, or mexican! I think they have breakfast included too. It's more of a "go to the desk get a bagel and coffee and walk back to your room" kind of deal. Not much room for more than a couple people at once. That's fine but your room could be across the whole parking lot which isn't always worth it. No comment about the food itself as I didn't get the breakfast. Would recommend. No complaints, especially for the price and location.< /Review>

Where do I even start? When we got there the price was way too high ($289.00 per night), also, the pool was in such poor condition. It had leaves in it and there was grime on the bottom of it. The key cards did not work half the time. When we looked in the fridge, there was food from god knows how long ago. The beds where uncomfortable and so was the couch. When we woke up, my whole family was covered with bug bites (bed bugs) and the bathroom had old towels in it when we got there. The sheets where dirty and some-what stiff like they had not been washed for a long time. The so called,"breakfast," only consisted of coffee, muffins, and cereal...nothing else. We paid for two nights but left after the first morning there. Luckily the guy at the front gave us a refund only after we said that we had gotten bitten by bed bugs and gave us a refund for the unused day/night. Checked out at 8:30 am but around 4 pm the owner called me saying we were thieves, liers, etc. for supposedly stealing the disgusting towels and even had the oddasitty to refer to us as,"you people," because of the color of our skin (we have darker skin). He threatened to call the police after a member of my party said we would go back there to show them. Would not recommened to my worst enemy. The only good part of the stay was getting the hell out of there. Also I didnt want to give them any stars but to submit this, I was forced to give a star rating and 0 was not an option.

0/0 would not stay here again...EVER!< /Review>

For a good stay at a good price and good location, this is a place for you. There's a Denny's adjacent to it.</Review>

<text>Yuck.  Shady neighborhood.  But has a pool and behind Denny's.  I saw two fights on the street in the one night i was there, they make you pay a $100 deposit upfront which is absurd, but like i said, shady neighborhood.

You get what you pay for.  If your company is too cheap to put you up in the DoubleTree, you can do worse than this.</text><Resp>None</Resp>< pictures>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Review>I was so disappointed to hear how poorly the receptionist at the Vagabond Hotel has treated my sister. My sister and brother-in-law took a trip to the east coast, and they planned on staying at the Vagabond when they flew back to California, because their home is several hours away from the airport.

But when 2 family members on the east coast passed away in a span of 24 hours, my sister had to change her travel plans at the last minute. The deadlines for reservation cancellations had already passed, but the airlines and other hotels involved showed some compassion to my family and made an exception for my sister's difficult circumstances. Everyone helped her cancel and/or reschedule reservations so she could attend two funerals last week -- everyone EXCEPT the receptionist at the Vagabond Hotel. The woman with the Indian accent -- who refused to share her name, so I'm calling her the "receptionist" -- was rude to my sister, charged her for a room that wasn't used, refused to consult her supervisor about a better solution, and then refused to speak any further with my sister.

When I called the hotel, on behalf of my sister, to try to get some information about what was happening, the woman hung up on me.

So here's my question for potential guests of the Vagabond Hotel: do you really want to support a business that employs rude people with an utter lack compassion?</Review>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) Good because the train station is right in front of you.
It is also near the city center so you can go anywhere.
You can eat at denny's right in front of you, and there is a convenience store next door.

(Original)
기차역이 바로 앞에 있어서 좋음.
또한 도심가 근처여서 어디로든 갈 수 있음.

(Translated by Google) Well this is a normal motel. However, there is a bathtub so it gets warm. I think it's not bad for the price.

The service here is good but they do take long so if you are coming to this store please make some time because a lot of people come to get new phones and new service so it takes some time.</text>

I went here with my dad to pay a bill and the staff was so nice and welcoming! The store was very clean and wide spread! Social distance compliant. Markiea, Jay and Niel make a great team and provide excellent support. They made the process quick and easy, especially for my dad. He appreciated their patience and an explanation of how his plan works! Thank you so much! KiV.<//text>

<text>Neil was super nice and helpful. After he went out of his way to ensure all my equipment worked I told him how I had a really bad experience at another store. He was very apologetic. Neil did a great job and I would recommend him to conduct training classes for your other Southern California associates. I was ready to move all of my lines from AT&T but since my experience with Neil I will continue to be a loyal customer< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Excellent,Neil your employee help me with everything. Actually he educated me on a lot of future the new devices have . I am a senior and I had a very old device now I have a new device and he help me so much. You don’t find many young peoples who care. He is a keeper. Thanks Neil and AT&T for the excellent service.

This store and all the staff were very helpful. Employees Neil & Cynthia both helped me out with the best customer service! Neil helped me out with setting up both new iPhones and ensured that every setting and function was working properly. Cynthia assisted us with transferring data from our previous iPhones as well and they both helped us with the screen protectors and cases. Neil & Cynthia are very great employees and you won’t regret their assistance if you have visit this store.< /review>

<Review>Bo was excellent helped with all of my issues caused by the salesmen at Costco never again will I do business with them. Bo explained everything from the issues my account had and offered solutions to those issues. Great knowledge and he should get a raise and or get promoted this coming from a business owner myself.<//Review>< Pics>

Torian gave me an excellent service when I upgraded my phone to 12 pro. I think AT&T’s authorized Retail store is way better than the corporate store when it comes to customer service. Thanks Torian for your help.< /review>

Markiea Jones helped myself and my aunt with a billing issue and was extremely helpful, patient, and kind. She was on the phone for over 30 minutes with the AT&T customer service rep and assisted us until our issue was resolved. We appreciate the exceptional customer service we received from Markiea and will definitely be back to this location.</Review>

Went in to pay a bill and Josh did an account analysis and let me know I had been over paying on my bill. I usually pay my bill at the store on Century and they’ve never tried to save me money. I’ll be coming to this store from now on. Thanks Josh!<//text>

<Text>Let me just say that though it’s COVID, this AT&T has been super effective at fulfilling my needs. (iPhone to be exact. LOL.) I called at first to ask about inventory and the man on the phone was super polite and answered all my questions. After I asked him his name, I decided to come in and take my shot at ordering. When I came in Bo helped me to order the new phone and was extremely thorough with process time and shipment information. My phone arrived in about 5 days (yay!!!!) and Bo helped me pick out a screen protector and a case. He was super friendly, informative, and patient with me. Super great experience.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>{'time': 1609359885884, 'text': 'Hi Olivia Jade Khoury.\nServing our customers with the best service possible is something we strive for every day.\nWe hope to connect with you soon.'}<//Response>< gmap_id>

Poor quality. I’ve only been here once and I’m never going back. The girl didn’t even prep my nails before she put the acrylic on. When it came time to putting the gel it was a horrible process. The polish had air bubbles in it and on some of the nails the top were horrible honestly. Not to throw shade but I don’t recommend coming here if your picky. And when the polish started falling off, under it wasn’t even dry. I haven’t even had these nails for a week and they’re already lifting.< /Text>

<gmapID>0x809aa016aba61b7f:0x794be396d471332c< /gmapID><Text>The technician was so rough on my daughters nails,  she rubbed her skin raw with the tools, even when she told her she was hitting her skin and that it hurt. She still proceeded on, added the matte finish (which stings) and then put her hands in the UV light which burned her and put my 9 year old into tears. Not to mention,  they were unable to accommodate the 3 toned ombre nails we wanted. All that and it cost me $155 for 3 painful manicures. I won't be coming back.< /Text>< date>

I called the evening prior to schedule an appointment for a pedicure only. Very professional and efficient service. No wait time. Very clean. Plastic barrier between the technician and me. I felt quite safe as pandemic precautions were in place. My toes look great!< /text>

<text>Lucy did an amazing job once again. Every time Lucy does my nails I walk out with a smile on my face and get so many compliments. She is quick and pays attention to the small details so my nails always come out looking amazing. Lucy has a customer for life in me!< /text>< Pics>

Just got a simple gel manicure and Paul was so nice and attentive . He did a fantastic job making my beat up from work hands look and feel great. I will definitely go back. Also loved that they took me in so fast on a Sunday. Very busy nail shop .< /text>

Holly did my acrylics beautifully. She took her time and truly made me feel fabulous with these nails! I appreciate her skill and attention to detail. Absolutely no complaints. If you want fierce nails, ask for Holly!<//review>

<Text>I love them here. Lucy does my nails and even when I come in with some crazy detailed and fun stuff she always gets it done ever better then I imagined. I love the atmosphere when I'm there everyone interacts with you and after being there a few times they know you by name. Always the best experience after trying out five other shops in lodi, I will never go back. This is my favorite nail salon. So thank you guys for all being wonderful and Lucy for my amazing nails.<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Horrible job. From the moment I walked in, the worker was rude, very bad customer service. I told the worker I didnt like the shape,color and they were crooked and the worker refused to fix them. She kept saying they were nice and pretty, I repeatedly told her I didnt want them that way and she didnt listen to what I wanted.</Review>

Terrible service, extremely rude employees, over priced I will never go back.
Just to let everyone know my gel manicure peeled off after 3 days.
The employees make you feel uncomfortable and I can tell they were talking bad about me.
Of course they don't speak English they couldn't understand simple requests. Again I will never go back. If you want good service go to Robert's nails !!<//review>

Super friendly staff. Waited for me after calling in late Sunday for an appointment.  I wish they would have separated my mani from pedi rather than Having 2 ladies work me at the same time,  it was uncomfortable turning my body for manicure while Having my pedicure done</Text>

<text>Unfortunately I was looking for a new nail shop and ran across this one online.  They have good reviews but they did a horrible job.  They’re the type of shop to rush for the next customer.  My nails were left looking dull and the shape was horrible.< /text>< user_name>

Delicious food, excellent service and phenomenal prices. The family meal is the best deal and most delicious we've had in a long time. The strawberry shakes are bomb and made with real strawberries. The grilled chicken salad was delicious! This is a new up and coming business that I highly recommend. The menu has a variety of goodies and I'm going to try each item at least once. Yes, its that good. You will not be disappointed.</Text>

<Text>I rarely write reviews but the level of service, food quality and portions are awesome! The owners truly love and care for their customers and go out of their way to make sure we are happy. I really enjoy talking to the owner and this establishment will definitely be a noteworthy place in Fresno. Their food quality and and their prices are super reasonable!

So its good food, but my biggest issue, and the reason it gets a 3 star, is because its literally the same food that Triangle Burger serves. Same deep fried burrito, same meat, same pastrami, same same same. Being that Triangle has been around longer its like they just tried to do a knock off of a successful business. Weres the originality?<//Text>

Good place for quick Sushi bite, calamari was over burned but two of my favorite rolls are the Kai roll and lemon cilantro.< /Text>

<time>1511742819913</time><Rate>5</Rate><Review>This may be the best sushi I have eaten since living in California. We had the pizza roll which was good, but then we had the Mango something? A-go-go? I cannot remember the name but when you get there and look at the menu, you will recognize it. It was FABULOUS. So fresh and perfect combination of ingredients. Then, we had the lime & tuna? Again, I don't remember the name but when you look at the menu you will recognize it. Somehow it beat the first one! I cannot wait to go back.<//Review>< pictures>

Wow we had an absolutely horrible experience here. Placed an order on the phone, she said it would be 45 minutes. Got there at the 40 minute mark, and when I gave my name she seemed flustered and said it would be 10 minutes until it was ready. That was fine, we didn’t mind waiting. So we sat at the counter, 10 minutes came and went. But she never apologized, never offered us water or anything, wouldn’t make eye contact with us, never updated us on the time, didn’t even have us pay ahead of time to save time. There were only 2 occupied tables at the time. We waited 25 minutes until it was ready, and she still never apologized. I will never return, I was absolutely livid at the service.</text>

This one is a bit out of the way from most places I do find myself going, but the sushi was great - service was excellent. A bit cold temperature inside *(maybe intentionally to keep things there fresh) and space seems kinda industrial inside. When compared to the Tabu in Vista or in Carmel Mountain, its a completely different Sushi experience - but please decide for yourself!< /Text>

I love love love Tabu and am so excited they are opening in Encinitas soon. The Del Mar location is were I currently go. The food is off the charts delicious. The menu is huge and the options for different kinds of sushi rolls is endless. This is by far my most favorite place to go for sushi.<//Text>

There was no one in the restaurant and to top it all off we waited 40 minutes for our food which never came. So we paid for our wine and left. They did not bother to refill drinks. They were not that friendly and they seemed to be inconvenienced by us asking for more water. I will never recommend this place to anyone.</Text>< rating>

We showed up here at 5:30pm on a Friday, and we're the only ones here! The wait staff was firendly, we sat at the bar. The Sushi chef was also very friendly, and made our food promptly when we ordered. The fish was fantastic! some of the rolls we're unusual, but we tried two and we're pleasently surprised! I would have preferred fresh mango slices to the mango "salsa" on the mango tango, but everything else was quite good! Bonus: they had Asahi on tap!< /Review>

We were craving for some good Sushi and started looking for some groupon. We came here with our groupon and they received it well.

The place was quite nicely decorated, very open and friendly atmosphere. Had a great friend serving our table, his name is Moe and he was very friendly and gave lot of helpful suggestions.

We ordered, crunchy shrimp, California roll, chicken ramen, dumplings.
Everything was edible, nothing more.</review>

You might think Sushi in Del Mar is gonna be a costly endeavor and that you might be able to save some time and money by going a little further north to Solana, Encinitas or Carlsbad and in general you'd be right, but this unassuming spot barely looks like a sushi spot from the outside and actually that rusty gate from the grocery store next door probably scare people off. It's awesome to come here when it's slow, you get super fast and amazing food and during daytime they have a HH that's killer on the deals. Kai roll, sushi burrito, philly.

They serve a ton of regulars and most of the staff will remember you if you come in a lot. The service is great, but most of all from the chef's with their great flavor profiles, knife skills and recommendations.

They have some major price jumps between standard rolls and premium as well as for their MP items like Uni, Toro, etc. The salad pricing like wakame is a bit high. If you don't mind getting certain rolls the HH can be as inexpensive as any place around, but their quality will keep you coming back regardless of the price.

Found out about this place as they also own Nozomi in Carlsbad, another diamond in the rough. Urban, Balance and Flower Hill have brought a lot more attention to this side of the 5.

Their salmon tends to be firm, while their tuna I found soft. They use a lot of jalapeno, cream cheese and sriracha in their rolls. They perfectly don't over fry their shrimp, the unagi sauce is a bit of an overload and really sweet. I always ask to go easy on the crunchies if any at all.

I don't like the word fusion and you'll see it in the rest of their menu being that it's pretty limited on the back end, but the front chefs are great.<//Review>

My wife and I ordered teriyaki vegetables and sushi to-go and were relatively disappointed with our meal. The service we experienced was good and we received our to-go order quickly, but the sushi just wasn't that great. The teriyaki vegetables were amazing and we really enjoyed those, but the two sushi rolls we ordered were just mediocre. Part of our issue was that the soy sauce which was served with our sushi (in little to-go packets) was incredibly salty. Disgustingly so. It completely overwhelmed the flavor of the sushi, the ginger, and the wasabi sauce. We'll definitely be back for some more teriyaki vegetables and chicken, but next time we'll probably skip the sushi. On a side note the prices for a $$ location weren't too bad. You can purchase sushi rolls there for as low as $5.50-ish (for an 8-piece roll). More expensive rolls can run up to $15 for a 10 piece roll. The excellent teriyaki vegetables were $12 for a substantial serving.</text>

(Translated by Google) What to say, what to say ...
We were 7 plus 2 children and yet all the service was impeccable. Smiling, cordial, quick. They would come back often to see if everything was okay.

Let's talk about dishes now, it's consistent, it's big, it's tasty! We are served platters with 10 original makis [instead of 6 in France], each one better than the next.

I'll just say their sake is average, but out of that it's really good.

The restaurant is large and therefore can accommodate a lot of customers, but the tables are kept widely spaced out so it's nice not to be crowded. It also allows you to get along without having to listen to what the next table is saying.

(Original)
Que dire, que dire...
Nous étions 7 plus 2 enfants et pourtant tout le service a été impeccable. Souriant, cordial, rapide. Ils repassaient souvent or voir si tout allait bien.

Parlons plats maintenant, c'est consistant, c'est gros, c'est goûtu! On nous sert des plateaux avec 10 originaux makis [au lieu de 6 en France] tous plus bons les uns que les autres.

Je dirai juste que leur saké est moyen, mais sorti de ça, c'est vraiment bon.

Le restaurant est grand et peut donc accueillir beaucoup de clients, mais les tables restent très espacées, donc c'est agréable de ne pas être serré. Ça permet aussi de s'entendre sans avoir à écouter ce que dit la table d'à côté.< /text>

The owners are friendly and attentive! They always shake my hand on a slow afternoon when I enter and are inviting to the local emerging music scene in the Coachella Valley at night! Catch a Dodger game, a dance night with friends, or THE BEST CHAVELA you've ever had! The space is small, but comfortable.<//Review>

<text>This location is smaller than other locations. The showcase floor doesn't have a lot of variety. A person (Kirsten?) helped us, she was great. Floor samples on sale is the way to go, the chair we bought does have some issues but that is why you pay a discounted rate.<//text></record>

< review>
If this is Canadian quality furniture, than Canadian quality is bad. Got bed frame from here and the wood cracked holding it together. Contacted to get replacement which took 6 weeks and had to sleep on ground. Turns out the replacement is faulty as well so we can just conclude the quality is horrible. Wouldn't recommend eq3 to anyone- you'll get higher quality at Ikea.</review>

There were at least 3 associates just doing their own thing, and maybe 5 customers milling around. It’s only after you find the thing you want and bring it to the register do they ask if you found everything you need. It’s just weird. I like to support the brick and mortars as much as possible, but you’re probably better off buying things online with this store.</Review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Alison was above and beyond helpful in finding us the right bed frame for our home.  She understood how all details were built and kept us very informed so that we made the best choice.

She knows her inventory very well!

We are so happy with our purchase and plan to come back soon for a couch.

Thank you< /Review>< GmapID>

<Date>1554092062275<//Date><review>This EQ3 shop is literally one of my favorite places on earth.  The staff always remember me and are incredibly personable.  The store does a good job of displaying the furniture in comfortable ways that I can easily see how it can work in my home.  I've been working for over a year to decorate my place and been all around the bay area with a lot of frustration.  Every time I go into this shop I simply feel great and it also really makes me much more comfortable spending the kind of money that home furnishing entails.< /review><gmapID>0x808f7e2e7b812a1b:0x6ce9b674d11bf60f<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I stood at the counter for over 10 minutes in un-acknowledged by the sales person. It was just weird and I decided to wait to see how long before she said a word to me. She walked away. I almost left the store with my stuff in hand but that didn’t seem right! :)</Review>

Just went in the tried to exchange a basket. The white elder lady with thick glass frame was so rude. I understand I didn’t have receipt and didn’t know the 30 day return policy prior. However, the lady was so rude and condescending. Never come back again to this snobby store.</text>

This place has great pieces at affordable prices.

I love the design of the space - and I really like the quality of all the different pieces in here.  Specifically, I was looking for couches, and they have a wide selection of different styles as well as different sizes.

I really like how attentive each of the sales staff is to your needs, and they also have a designer who can come to your house and advise (for free!)< /Text>

<Text>Every time I walk in to EQ3 SF I'm greeted like their best customer and dear friend and family!I love the furniture pieces, and I love the accessories.  They have one of the nicest lighting and rug collections and at a price point for everyone.  I love the Marimeko collection and all the art pieces.  You can always find something to go home with. If you happen to be in Emeryville go to the second level and catch their bay view!  Don't miss this special store becasue you think the decor will not match yours!  There's always easy parking at the SF store, and you will get great customer service and all your purchases are kept on file.  Easy!  PS they're sales are super!<//Text><gmap_id>0x808f7e2e7b812a1b:0x6ce9b674d11bf60f</gmap_id><Rate>5< /Rate></record></dataset><record>

When I went to pick-up my "Otis" rug (for over $800) from the San Francisco store, I was told to load it into the car myself as the warehouse staff would not help.  I should have known then that the customer service at EQ3 is non-existent.

It shed quite a bit in the beginning which I attributed to it being new and assumed it would eventually subside.  Unfortunately, this poor quality rug sheds INCESSANTLY and I have to vacuum our hardwood floors daily to clean-up all of the threads.

I brought this to the attention of the store manager and he informed me that it was not his problem and that I would have to contact customer service in Winnipeg, Canada.  For this reason alone the company deserves only one star, but that is only the beginning.

I spoke with Victoria Knapp in the customer service department and she asked me to explain the problem and send photos.  This was followed-up by multiple email exchanges and Victoria explaining that it is "normal" for a rug to shed incessantly.

I was then put in contact with Ryan Franz, EQ3 Customer Care Team Lead.  Mr. Franz also informed me that it was customary for this rug to shed excessively.

Well . . . that was two years ago and I still have to vacuum the floor every day to clean-up this mess of a rug.

EQ3 has some cool stuff but the workmanship is shoddy and the customer service is non-existent.   Save your money and frustration!  There are plenty of other business with better products and better customer service.< /Text>

<Review>The worst sleeper sofa we ever had! I am not pleased with the quality of this sleeper sofa and will make sure in the future not to buy their product. It speaks for itself for whoever sees it as well. Our previous sofa that  was leather, white and much cheaper stayed for 3 years without any prints on it. Versus EQ3 sofa that the moment we got it  broke (5min after they brought it into our place wires popped up) and on the top of it anywhere you apply more pressure we get the print in the leather. Their furniture sucks big time and is not family friendly in any way. Seems more for the museum then everyday use. For the money I paid for it I am very much disappointed, but the lesson is learned. We'll never again be their customers.
The customer service said:"As per our warranty, we do not cover products deemed to have been misused or products that are in a condition resulting from unusual usage. Standing, kneeling, or jumping on the sleeper are all forms of misuse. Our warranty also states to not allow children to play on mechanized furniture or operate mechanisms, to not stand on chairs/seats, and to not sit on product arms."
I was laughing reading it. Why on the Earth we need the peace of furniture where we need to put restrictions on living our life. If I knew all of this prior to buying this worthless sofa-this would not happen. I just imagine measuring the weight of our guests and reading them conditions of sitting since if they put more weight on their but, my sofa will suffer.
The more ironic thing is that the bad leather dents are even on the inside of the sofa armrests where we do not touch ever. My guess would be (since we just got it recently) that it's not supposed to be carried to people's houses at all because carrying leaves the dents on the sides of the armrest.
I think the safest way of preserving sofa is not to sit on it or touch it, but just leave it in the store.
I hope this will help on saving some money for any of you who is reading this lines.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None</response><GmapID>0x808f7e2e7b812a1b:0x6ce9b674d11bf60f< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I went so I could try one of the new chicken sandwiches, and so I could get a shamrock shake before they're gone. I got the spicy chicken sandwich, and it was actually pretty good. I was also happy that I received my order as it was placed, and wasn't missing any items.</Text>

Super slow I was in drive through line at last window for at least 10 minutes waiting for my food and before that another 10 just waiting in a pretty long line I feel everytime I go I’m always waiting is go to a different one but this is closest to me and on base also as I was sitting there an employee was just sitting there on her phone.. I would give only 1 star but they actually got my order right</review>

Horrible service and management of a facility. Walked in, stood there ten minutes not one person acknowledged we were even there. Several disgruntled people waiting for food inside, drive through seemed to be a better option.< /Review>

Why can you upgrade a meal drink to a McFlurry on the app and not in the drive through? Out of sprite and gave me unsweetened tea instead of sweet tea. Not that big of a deal however. Only got one of the two fries that were ordered (which were cold) along with both burgers being cold.<//Review>

Like always, this is the weaker of the two McDonald's on Camp Pendleton. They did not have the needed requirements for a strawberry or chocolate shake, but the machine was working for once. Very long drive thru line, and when I went to the first window to pay, no one was there... after over 5 minutes or more of waiting, I pulled up to the second window because the cars in front of me had left. They were confused no one was at the first window and even more so that I finally pulled up to the second window. They were polite.< /Text>

She caused me to spill my drink in my new camaro and when I politely asked if she had given me the sweet and sour sauce she said “ I don’t know you can look in the bag”. The customer service here is beyond me. The manager should consider correcting their employees or they will lose business. The fries also have no salt.<//review>< Date>

<text>If I could give negative stars, I would. This location is abhorrent. I have never spent less than 30 minutes in this drive thru line, whether there is 1 car ahead of me or 4-5. Food is ALWAYS COLD! How does this happen? For all the time it takes me to make it up to the pickup window, shouldn’t my food be freshly made? Tonight I spent 1.5 hours in line STUCK! I couldn’t even drive away after waiting 45 minutes because I was stuck in line between cars. I called from the drive thru line to speak with the a manager and they hung up on me... I am so upset with this experience...<//text>< Pics>

It says 1200 drive through at 1129 and they answered us instantly in the drive through but told us they were closed...don't understand why they would be closed 30 minutes early but still be able to answer us instantly in the drive through.... adjust the hours online or do your job...</review>

Nice place, decent food. The French fries aren't always hot/warm and crisp, drive through is very slow always long lines and slow moving. Partly due to people making large orders since dinning room is limited (thanks Covid) and other part seems like a skeleton crew is working, basically un prepared for high traffic.
My rating will be better if COVID restrictions are eliminated and or drive through time is improved. Sitting 15mins 4/5 cars back from order kiosk is crazy. Could have went inside and ordered. But where are the signs saying order inside is available?
Maybe you will have better luck than me.
Look forward to a better experience next time.<//text>

Wow I can’t believe this place is still here.  I’ll start with the drive thru or in this case drive park because this has to be the slowest mcdonalds ever. They are always out of something as well without fail something will be unavailable.  The lobby is randomly closed and when you go inside the employees always act like it’s a big inconvenience.  If you can eat somewhere else.</review>

Horrible service this morning. The person had an attitude, dragging himself around. I usually come every other morning for the sausage McMuffin combo w/o egg. Same thing every morning, all of a sudden the price goes from less than $5 for the combo to $7.75. I didn’t even get ice in my drink!  This is definitely that sign that I need to stop eating at McDonalds.......

I don’t see the franchisees responding to any of their valuable feedback, what a great way add further damage to the Branding of McDonads Camp Pendleton when you don monitor your own reviews/complaints for further action.

I’ve also felt like the military community gets the shaft so many times when it comes to being offered Great Customer service because it’s “on base”. This final experience solidified the struggle.... This entire resteraunt needs to be placed on a “Performance Improvement Plan”<//review>

This on base McDonalds has jumped the shark, for bad service, and bad food.
I've tried to go here to this one three times in the past week, and it takes more than 25 mins to get through the drive thru...
AND...they can't get an order right.
I give up. We won't be back.</review>

I've been coming here for 3 years and the experience has not changed. They are rude with customers, extremely slow at taking orders, and consistently get orders wrong. I do not recommend this mcdonald's to anyone in the area. You're better off at the local restaurants near it.</Text>

The place was dirty, 95% of the staff looked unhappy and tire. They are understaffed. Staff don't have patience for costumers. The floor was sticky and dirty like soda was spilled and was not clean properly. There was food on the floor at the other side of the counter where staff were preparing the orders. Our sandwiches were not prepared like in other McDonalds, the big mac was inundated with the spread that the bread for soggy. My friend's sandwich had her meat burnt. The French fries for both of us were not fresh, the ones that they gave us had been sitting out under the light. Did I mention that the place was dirty? I'm surprise that they are serving in a military base in those conditions.</Review>

Waited in line for 30 minutes. When my son opened his box of chicken nuggets it contained 4 sliced tomatoes. Terrible service.  Consistently gets orders wrong or incomplete. The only reason they are still in business is that there are no other similar fast food restaurants on base< /text>

Well for the last time we went here for a treat of fries and McFlurrys...the LARGE fries were actually filled to the level of a poor MEDIUM...twice in 2 weeks. Bye McDonald's...oh, the McFlurrys were great.</review>

Wait was long, ran out of cherry pies, no ice cream ready yet. Not sure what's going on at this location. Customer Service needs help. Remember you are serving Service Members they should get the best service you can give. Our Service members sacrifice a lot to protect this country. At the very least we can do is have a hot meal and the best service we can give. Thank You to all the Service members.< /text>

Food is okay. Service was good and it came out in a timely manner. I don't recommend the new slurpees unless you love to drink pure syrup, too much sugar in them.</Text>

They never get anything right. Constantly don’t give the full order. They leave off extras you pay for like Bacon. Good luck if you try ordering food here and definitely check your order before you leave. It’s one thing if it happens every so often, but EVERY trip? Get it together.</Review>

Don't normally eat McDonald's, but it was okay; however, $2.50 for sm fry, and $5 for a really small Filet-o-fish seemed high.</Review>

Service was slow, and the food was cold by the time I received it.  Seemed like a very unorganized kitchen as well.  They deleted someone's order before it was even prepared for them.<//Text>

Only two employees but both thanked us & made sure we were taken care of. That is not what we’re used to from young people behind the counters or Drive thru window.<//Review>< Pics>

This restaurant does not communicate with the mobile ordering app. On two separate occasions I ordered from the mobile app for pickup, but when I got there some of the items I ordered were out of stock.  Also the drive thru service is painfully slow. About a month ago I spent 45 minutes waiting in line. Most of the time it’s upward of a 15 minute wait. About 50% of the time the workers are not very polite either.< /text>

The order is never correct the app never works and it's just not even worth it anymore to get fast food at this location if I wanted to wait in line for 20 minutes and get incorrect food I'm pretty sure I can do that at home and probably save time< /Review>

<Review>There's usually a long wait, they are often out of everything and sometimes the food is a bit cold. BUT they are absolutely the hardest working staff I've ever seen. They have so many military customers, so I understand the long waits, food shortages and cold food at times. They work so hard and they are very friendly, even on their busiest days!<//Review><userid>113791798920487653703< /userid><Resp>None<//Resp>< Rating>

Something in the order is always messed up from not giving all of the food we ordered to being charged the wrong price. Its hit or miss if the person you talk to about the problems will give attitude or not. The giant bug on my hashbrown was it for me. Clearly they do not care. Please if you want McDonalds drive the extra 4 mins to oceanside Blvd. I Would give 0 stars if possible.</Review>

<text>We order breakfast sandwiches and then charged us for it but gave us a completely different McMuffin. The lady serving us wasn’t very welcoming either. She didn’t smile nor sounded happy. They quality of there egg was horrible. My two daughters and I all got sick after consuming. My eldest, who was the only one that didn’t have egg, didn’t get sick. They had disgusting bathrooms and the workers were very rude. Never going there again!!!<//text><Date>1574782680971</Date>< Pictures>

Probably one of the worst McDonald's I've been to. They're always slow, orders are usually incorrect, and their soda machine never has the correct mixtures. The service is good, aside from that, this McDonald's is horrible.< /Text>

This McDonalds hardly ever refills their soda machine. Almost every time I've gone, their drinks are either too carbonated with no syrup or have too much syrup with little carbonation. Not to mention the sweet tea is non existent. I've been given unsweet every time and have had to change it out for the watered down Dr. Pepper.</text>

<Review>Terrible! It took 45 minutes in drive-thru at 8pm at night and there was no way to get out of line and go inside. We waited so long both of my kids fell asleep waiting for there dinner. They also got my order wrong for the kids meal and gave me chicken instead of a cheeseburger after waiting for forever. It would of been faster if I would of gone off base...I know better for next time.<//Review>< pictures>

Order is usually wrong but because they are the closest McDonald’s without driving across base, it’s usually packed and they have slow service and half the time you get old warm food. I haven’t heard many good things about this McDonald’s...< /Review>

The cashier gave me a number card to place on my table and told me someone would bring my food to me since I’m dining in. A worker walked by with a bag of food and asked me what I ordered. After I told her, she said this isn’t my order. I sat at my table waiting for 10 minutes and wondered how much longer it will take so I went up to the front counter to ask. Turns out the bag that worker was walking around with was my food and she left it on counter so it has been sitting there the whole time. What’s the point of giving me a random number? It’s better to call out the number on my receipt and have me get up to pick it up myself. My food was cold by the time I got to it.</Text>

On Sunday around 4:45 PM.  There were only like 8 people eating. The place was a mess, food on the floor and no clean tables were available. We had to clean our own table. Our frys were old and cold.</Review>

Once you get to the second window, it's another 10 minutes. Workers goof off and use awful language with the window open. I'm all about making work fun, but the workers' behaviour was very distasteful and crude. If I had a child in the back, I would have been even more upset. Also, at the second window, I don't want to hear workers talking about their "protien farts" as I'm waiting 20 to get my food. There needs to be a staff evaluation of this establishment. I've never seen a fast food joint as disorganized and pitiful as this one.</Text>< Pics>

The wait for less than 5 cars at the drive through is consistently greater than 15 minutes. Staff was rude on at least one occasion, and their prices are $1-2 higher per meal higher than right off base. Go to Panera.<//text>

McDonald's claim to fame is their mechanized precision and speed....this place has neither. Don't bother using the mobile app either because it doesn't decrease your wait at all. This base needs Chick-fil-A.<//review>

Another nearby base (NMCSD) also had a McDonald's.  That restaurant is fast and efficient.  Management at Pendleton could learn much from NMCSD's management.  Really the service is the slowest of any fast food place I have ever been to in the 44 states I have traveled.<//review>< Pics>

This is appalling to treat the men and women who protect our country in this manner and worse you are located on base. I am sure lots of restaurants will love to have your location. Please retrain these people. Thank you.< /review>< user_id>

<review>30 min for 2 happy meals is ridiculous.... to add they forgot everything but the nuggets and toy 🤦🏽‍♀️. When we pulled up to the window it looked like everyone was standing around. Whoever the manager is needs to either retrain their employees it clean house and get employees who actually do their jobs.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

Absolute worst Mcdonalds anyone could ever go to. It’s been over a year in the making of just constant messing.up ever single order. Asked for bacon Big Mac and got no bacon. Asked for a double quarter pounder with cheese and got a quarter pounder without cheese. The food is never hot it is at most room temp.  The service is terrible. Only thing good about is when i have been in there it was clean.  I created an account just to do this review if that tells you something<//review>

Had a rough experience here.  The manager was running register and they seemed short staff.  The food took about avg time, but the nuggets were burnt.  They refunded the guy in from of me.  They also forgot to make my 3rd kids meal.  This place was well kept and clean, but I feel they are way understaffed and super busy all the time.< /Review>

<review>Honestly I come here out of convenience of location but by far they have the worst customer service. Today alone bc the lady taking orders was giggling every 3 seconds she kept asking “what” after everything I ordered & after a long day of work I go to the drive thru for it to be fast HENCE FAST FOOD. I get it’s McDonald’s I shouldn’t expect chick fil a customer service but damn dude the least y’all could do is put your listening ears on when the customer is trying to order bc we can hear you giggling when you don’t turn the mic off AND DONT GET ME STARRED ON HOW I ALWAYS GET RAW UNSALTED POTATO SLICES YOU CALL FRIES.</review>< Gmap_id>

It's your average McDonald's. Nothing special but be prepared to wait anywhere from 20-60 minutes. Service is okay but if anything you should definitely go to a different McDonalds</Text>

<text>This is the worst McDonald's I have ever had the misfortune of going to. They are CONSTANTLY out on so many things - burger patties, chicken tenders, ice cream machine is always out. The staff are very poorly trained. You could be standing at the register for a good 10-15 minutes and everyone who walks by will act like they don't see you waiting there to have your order taken. Drive-through always has ridiculously long lines. They are incapable of making custom orders so good luck trying to order something that deviates from what is written on the menu. Everybody moves sooooo slooooow that everything takes forever. It's faster to just drive to a place off-base. Save yourself the headache.< /text>< pics>

McDonald's is a great place to take the kids out of the house to get a pic of your favorite food for your family and your friends will help me find the recipe to make you feel more relaxed in your room with the investigation of a few people in your life music for a couple guys who have a bd125-15 in a day or a half hour and then you get off<//Text>

You might as well go 5 miles out to another McDonalds, and you would still be home to eat your food before this place serves you.  I used the app and waited for 40 mins,  only to find out they forgot about my order, other times it’s been sorry we’re out of this or that, and they always seem to forget something on your order.
I’ve been pretty much everywhere, and I have a hard time finding a worst McDonald then the one on Camp Pendleton.  In the words of my 4 year old son, dad!!!! They’re Bad, bad, bad!!!</Text>

Don't even deserve one star. Going through the drive through, it took  20 minutes between the time we placed our order, and the time we got to the pick up window. Car in front of us sat at pay-window more than 5 minutes before someone took their money. And then waited at the pick-up window more than 10 minutes for their one bag of food! Unacceptable!
Asked to speak to manager, to let him know that it took us 20 min to get our food, and to find out, why those customers had not been asked to park while waiting, so the line could keep moving.
To that he answered, that he was only there to stock, and that he didn't know.
Never heard of a manager who "stocked", instead of making sure his store ran smoothly!
On top of that we were short one sandwich, and didn't get any straws for our drinks.< /text>

<Text>The servers, superb. Management, however, very disrespectful and careless. The cashiers were very polite and patient. One of the individuals in charge (basing this off of their white uniform whereas the other workers wore black) literally dropped my meal on the counter in front of me. I looked up at her, said thank you yet she continued to walk away. I said it louder to the point that everyone turned towards me so I know she heard. The other individual wearing the same white uniform pointed and me and they both looked at me, looked at each other, and laughed and danced around like they owned the place. Immediately after her short jig, the first lady in white started snapping, pointing, and demanding in a condescending tone to the worker at the fry pit to "Get to work" and then turned to her counterpart and complained how lazy "the workers are these days" openly in front of everyone. Extremely disrespectful. Very poor image of the establishment to convey to the public.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

The worst Mcdonalds i have ever been to. Dont bother they will mess up your order every time, whether there is traffic of orders or not. I feel really bad for the managers because you can tell they try hard and will make up for the others mistake.but the fact that the rest of the employee keeps messing up and playing on their phone, once taking selfies at the drive thru window!
Not just that they dont even have they're stuff up to date , all the other mcdonalds just a couple miles away have the berry sprite on the digital ordering menu in the drive thru, while the one on base has to put in a lemonaid. Half the time they give you a lemonaid because of lack of communication.
I hope someone fixes this place.<//Text>

Horrible customer service. Night shift is the worst. They lack on so much from customer service to uniforms. They often dont wear uniforms. These girls dont want people coming in at night. They turn away too many people saying cash only, no product availability, they dont even want to sell soft drinks. There is a 20 to 35 minute wait for drive thru, when only two vehicles on line. Fries are raw and food takes forever because they dont want you back during their shift. I'm not sure if theres two supervisors or just Nicole Cummings but should not be left along to run the store.< /review>

THE SLOWEST MCDONALDS EVER! Doesn't matter if you order ahead, go inside, or drive through, you will be waiting between 30-60 minutes. Once you get your food, it wont be correct and it will be cold. Just take the time to drive off base or go somewhere else. This place isn't worth the headache.</review>

Always check your order before you leave this one, and some of the employees get attitude with customers here too. One got mad at me for asking if my number had been called, rolled her eyes as she gave me my food, then angrily threw my ranch in the bag because she didn't like me asking for ranch either I guess.</Review>

With only two orders at the counter.  We should not have to wait 15 for a sing order of fries.  We gave up and got a refund and no fries.  The family that was ahead of us waited longer, only to have to return because the order was missing food.<//Text>

If you’re in a hurry and there’s more than two cars in the drive through, go somewhere else. They are generally slow and occasionally get your order wrong.<//Review>

Came to the drive through at 8:38pm didn't leave drive through until 9:00. Saw the cashier (Daniel) just chilling at the window talking to his friends in the car at the pick up window. Waste of time.<//Text>

Took thirty minutes to get two mcflurries at eight at night. Slow service. Drive through seems confused most of the time. Literally in line right now in a single lane drive through and they lost track of our order. And when the order doesn't take 30 minutes it's usually wrong anyway. Probably the worst McDonald's I've been to.< /text>

This is by far the worst McDonalds I've ever visited.  The order is never right.  What is the most disappointing though is the employee's lack of willingness to make it right or act like they care.  I was placed in the reserved drive thru because my food wasn't done.  That was fine.  When they brought my food I told her I was never given straws.  She said she'd bring some out.  She never did.  I called the store and asked for some.  Nobody ever came out.  I eventually left with nothing to drink my soda with.  Is this an isolated incident? No.  The employees lack insight into how to perform their jobs at just a baseline level.  It's too much work for them.  Plus, my orders are wrong more than they are right.  I'd be hard pressed to find a worse McDonalds.< /Text>

This McDonald's always messes up my order whenever I go through the drive thru. EVERY SINGLE TIME I go drive thru there's always something missing. I don't get it. How hard is it for the employees to simply remember a small order.</Text>

We finished swimming at the beach and wanted a snack to hold us before dinner. We decided this McD's. The line was long on drive thru but the wait sure wasn't. This place ran like a well oiled machine. Very proficient at getting our order w a nice voice and getting our order thru at the window. Good job guys.< /text>

Staff friendly.  They seemed concerned when I told them there was a standing puddle of urine in the middle of the bathroom, but the 5 mins I was sitting there waiting for my food, no one went in there to check.  But guess it fitted in with the sticky floors at the counter.
I avoid McDs as much as I can but swear every time I go there the hamburgers are smaller.<//text>

<Text>Becareful they over charge for things alot so really have them repeat your order and do your own math before payment. I understand its mainly teens and they need the experience but they need to do things right, also, last I went all orders of drinks and dressings were wrong. So make sure you check once you get your food. McDonald's is McDonald's it's just the people working the service wrong.<//Text></record>

Went there about 11 pm and they gave me cold disgusting food. Tasted like it had been sitting under a heating lamp for hours. I ordered chicken nuggets and fries which took about 15 mins in the drivethru. Im definitely not trying them again.</review>
