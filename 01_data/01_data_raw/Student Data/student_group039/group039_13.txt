sadly this post office has a rude employee/manager not willing to assist in any services, Watched two people with scheduled passport services turned down even when they were waiting in a long line and told them they have to come back later. They also had attitude with me simply for asking for a clear envelope and nothing else just to put my prepaid postage in for drop off as they don't bother to stock the self service kiosk and I had to organize the drop off as it was overfilled just to place my package in.

Remember the American people are customers too and even if the environment is busy as it always is when being a postal worker that doesn't excuse you from having a poor attitude and treating people poorly for a government service.</text>

I went in for passport services and was attended quickly(had an appointment). The workers there were very fast and efficient. Wendy was the best ! She helped a ton with my passport problems.</text>

BAD very bad, I made an appointment for the passports I arrived 20 min before and they told me that the person in charge of that had to leave, I asked them to explain why they did not send an email or call to notify that they canceled my appointment, the manager  With a name “rim” or something like that it was very rude and disrespectful to say that they call me, I tried to show him that there were no calls or emails about it, he still annoyed said "you make an appointment again" I think it is not the right way  They do not know what I was done to be able to attend  and the time in our work.  I know he was upset that someone else  yelled at him for the poor service and lost packages (I hope that person does something about it so that they check this place). Once again... Be more responsible in your work and grateful ... there are people who do want to work.< /Review>

Compare to the post office and employees at the Hawthorne post office on Inglewood blvd.   This post office is perhaps the Rolls Royce of post office.  Fast, friendly, and very courteous.  I wonder why?? A longer drive from my place , but worth the drive.   Keep up the excellent work.< /Text>

<text>The employees were nice but I made a passport appointment online, I showed up with my documents, my confirmation number, and they said I was not on the list physical list of names.

They preferred to turn me away since they were not staffed appropriately. I had to be "sqeezed" in. Waited an hour. What is the point of an online appointment to be treated as a walkin?

I would give 1 star but the employee was very nice.< /text>< pictures>

The female mail carrier with the red dreds ALWAYS Delivers mail in the wrong mail boxes in my building. My magazines are always weeks pass delivery date, packages and mail always lost and this post office does nothing about it. The WORST customer service. No sense of urgency, no care about your lost mail and packages. They don’t try to help or solve the problem. The mail carriers lie about delivering packages. Alert will say package delivered to mailbox and you MIGHT get it days after or never get it. It’s pathetic! I’m taking this as far up the chain as possible. Unacceptable!<//Review>

Update: super rude!!!  I am going to file a complaint cause whoever the supervisor is super rude

I asked for a hold on my mail this weekend and they delivered my packages. I don’t know which I have received cause some don’t have tracking numbers and are international. I will be filing a complaint cause I told the carrier and made a hold online and it was greatly ignored! Bring Nani back!!< /review>

Worst post office EVER. I've never had such horrible postal service. I've lived here since 2009 and they have NEVER picked up any outgoing mail. We always have to take it to the post office or to a drop off box.  They never drop off packages on time and won't even look at the delivery slips, let alone pick them up or read them!  They lie about even leaving a pick up slip. We saw the mail lady coming, so we waited for the package to be delivered. She was walking so fast, she was practically running, then just smiled and went on her way.  Come to find out she said, "Notice Left (No Authorized Recipient Available)."
LIES. We watched her and checked the box, there was nothing! No notice. I can't wait to get to an area with decent postal service.</review>

Always perfect, the time here is much less then other post offices around. USPS in general is a large and complex shipping services, it's a hit or miss at each location and thank God this one is less toxic then the rest!! I'm giving this place 5 stars because they always take care of me. I can't speak for everyone els unfortunately, but I hope you guys try and get along with the clerks, as I have learn to do,  and have an open community presence when addressing them. We need them, and they need us.  ...It's hard I know, buts it's made a huge difference with me and the second I changed my mood they also fell In line.< /Review>

<text>The mangr is the problem. The staff is ok. They were friendly but the mangr had some nerve and has real professional issues. We got there needed passport photos and she told us they dont take the pics there. I know that was a lie since I was there literally 30min before and my wife took them. She thought I couldn't hear her but she was saying to staff that she "didnt feel like taking them" another employee said she would. While taking pics for my newborn passport the mangr right in front of us without shame nonchalantly says "this is why. I dont feel like touching no baby. I'm not doing" again the employee stepped in helped us without the managers help. We were there for 3hrs doing all this and saw the manager several times on her phone making me and other ppl wait in line. Sometimes right up at the window. She needs to quit if she doesnt feel like doing her job.<//text>< pictures>

<review>My experience was horrible, I was supposed to get a package today. I checked my track status where it said the package was delivered, but nowhere near my house. I immiediately contacted the postal office and the supervisor told me early they were trying to contact the mail carrier. I waited a long time for a response so I went to the post office and got the same response. I called three times and in the third call the supervisor told me very rudely to not keep calling because they have no control over the mail carrier. Are they not trained to deal with situations like this? As the customer I have the right to know what happened to my package regardless of me asking constantly. Why be rude which is why I post this complain on how this post office is unprofessional with the wrong people working in it. May the higher authority come across this statement because CHANGE IS NECCESSARY!

I'm still waiting for a call letting me know what happened but they are now closed which means they don't know what happened.</review><Date>1485481051793<//Date><pics>None< /pics></record>

I track my package and it stated it was delivered when I look in my mailbox there is no package. I went to the post office to see if it was brought back there they said no...no one can tell me why its stating delivered in mailbox. I live in a gated complex so its unlikely someone can steal it. I call USPS and made a report because I believe it must be the driver or someone at the location stealing these packages it has happen on more than one occasion. After I made the report package was brought to my mailbox surprisingly. I will continue to check up on my report because a thorough investigation should be done at this post office. I do not want to judge or accuse but something is truly up and something needs to be done.<//text><gmapID>0x80c2b44bc448353d:0x9900a0f6bf5d7b4c</gmapID>< rate>

<text>Saturday we had a package come to our house from Amazon via the USPS. It says on our mailbox deliver all packages behind the gate. It got thrown over the gate. Amazon doesn't just sell books, this was a keyboard. My husband saw it happen but by the time he got to the front of the house (we're in a back duplex, the carrier was not to be seen. I had a package coming priority mail and had the email confirming it. I waited outside for the carrier and asked him where it was, he said no package for you. I faxed the post office and it was delivered after 5pm. Guess the carrier didn't want to carry the package. I never had this problem in Redondo Beach or Hawthorne, but Lawndale is a feudal land all to itself.<//text><Rate>2</Rate></record>

(Translated by Google) I sent a card to my grandson of complenos and it was opened by the side and they took out $ 25 dollars that I sent him
This is not the first time the cards are lost or opened
The address is
15122 korblum ave. Lawndale CA 90260
I'm sorry but I think they have not recommended mail carriers with no ethics
My name is Maria E Salas
My address 633 SW 2nd St Hallandale Fl 33009
Thank you

Thank you for being so respectful to your customers during the Certific of Vaccination ID plandemic. I am doing more regular grocery shopping here and paying couple extra dollars for the sustainably farmed Humbolt milk and butter that naturally keeps our immune systems working properly. Thank you for carrying real apple cider too. The only thing that you are missing is stocked apple cider from Clendenen's in Fortuna. ☺< /Text>

<user>115721424740967995703</user><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Text>ON THE GO?  Pick up some of their organic prepared foods (sandwiches, soups, salads , complete meals, fresh blended juices, bakery items etc.).  You can get fresh sliced organic meats and cheeses to go too.

GREAT PLACE TO GET FRESH LOCAL PRODUCE!

Their cucumbers right now are fresh and crisp.   The winter squashes are great, especially the butternut squash which has a beautiful orange color inside.  There are a good variety of sprouts available too. Their fruit is very fresh and I have found that it stays fresh longer when I buy it here!

I like the fact that the nuts in their bulk section are actually fresh, not brown on the inside like some other stores.

There's something here for everyone, even if you're on a diet!

Also, employees in the supplement section are very knowledgeable.  GOT A QUESTION?  JUST ASK.  Other employees will actually go out of their way to help you find what you're looking for.

LOVE THE FRIENDLY SERVICE AT CHECKOUT!</Text><Rate>4< /Rate><GmapID>0x54d2ecea5d01b919:0x5988ce279e53c2a6<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Love this store so much! I have celiac and I shop here whenever I want to get a snack or something. It's an awesome store if your lactose, vegan, vegetarian or celiac, or even just intolerant to stuff like soy or gelatin. Just about any kind of diet. :) it's pretty cool cause not a lot of towns have this kind of option<//Review>< user_id>

If I could give negative stars I  would given Orchard Nutrition the maximum negative stars.  Orchard Nutrition's rudeness cost them a customer today.  My husband and I will no longer be shopping at this establishment.  We shop every Saturday morning here.  This morning when I asked the salesperson in the vitamin department if they carried a certain vitamin brand I was searching for, she said "no, we don't carry that brand" and turned her back on me and walked away.  She never asked me if she could help me find something or what kind of vitamin I was looking for, etc.  I was shocked at how rude this "salesperson" was.  I have been an assistant manager at one of the country's largest retail natural vitamin and supplement stores and this extremely poor customer service would never have been tolerated in the company I worked for, in fact, we would have been fired.  I then asked to speak with a manager who happened to be at the checkout next to ours and she said "they'll have to come over to this line" to speak with her.  So in addition to being treated rudely by the "salesman" I now have to go out of my way to come over to her lane to speak with her.  These two employees made us feel like they were doing us a favor by working there instead of us doing them a favor by shopping there.  We will now be buying our supplements online and going to Trader Joe's and other grocery stores in town for our other needs.  I want a sincere apology for being treated so poorly instead of just given lip service.  We are super excited that Sprout's will be opening soon and will put this establishment out of business.<//Text>

This place has a lot of variety! They have soap/toothpaste/etc, essential oils, supplements, produce, shelf stable goods, refrigerated and frozen items, and a bakery. They have a bunch of stuff available in bulk, including a lot of herbs and spices, nuts, flours, and even honey! You can find things made by local producers, such as chapstick or candles. There are a lot of specialty foods for different diets or allergy restrictions, including non-dairy milks, flours, pasta, etc. The people are always nice, and I had one experience in particular where an employee helped me figure out which kind of post-surgery probiotic I needed. In general, this store is a lot more ethical and sustainable. The prices are a little high for me to come here often, but it’s understandable- they have quality products, made more ethically, so they are going to have to cost more. Overall, I’d highly recommend going in and checking it out! It’s a cool little place, and you’ll definitely find something interesting.</Text>

<review>I called Orchard Nutrition to check if they have a specific type of herbal vitamin. The lady checked for me and told me they do not have anything that I was looking for, as I was saying thank you to her she cut me off and says "bye" in a very rude manner. I do not appreciate being hung up on over the phone especially when I was kind to this woman and I was trying to thank her. Very rude!</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

really disappointed in how they treated a man who was hungry.  he came to me asking for a sandwich.  nothing frivolous or outlandish, just a sandwich.  didnt even ask for chips and a drink...He was genuinely hungry and thankful to just have something as simple as a sandwich.  so I said absolutely I'd love to get you that sandwich.  we walked into the store and I brought him to the sandwich area. I handed him the slip that gets filled out to place your order for whatever sandwich you want. This sweet man didnt even get to put his name on his order slip before 2 Male staff members showed up and told him that he had to leave. I asked "why are you kicking out a paying customer?" one of the Male employees put his hand up towards me with his palm out and said "it's not something I can discuss with you, he just needs to leave". I told this poor sweet man not to worry. to go outside and sit with my husband and I'll be right out with the sandwich he picked. after paying for this sandwich I walked to him and my husband and handed him his sandwich.  he ate it as though he hadn't had food in days. we asked him if he was in need of anything else and he said "no, this sandwich was all I needed I was very hungry ".... this was my very first experience with this store. I am new to the area and honestly wasn't expecting to be so disappointed in the service.  they seemed to of forgotten that low income people are people to. That sometimes people can be down on their luck. This man was sweet as could be. he was very mild mannered and did not appear to be on any drugs. he was just hungry, in need and reaching out to a fellow human.  Orchard Nutrition Center you should be ashamed of how you treated that man. you never know, you could one day be in the place of the man who you treated like scum.

In regards to their recent retort on my experience I plan to begin bringing the less fortunate into their store and testing them on the things their saying.  I will edit my experience and rating based upon what takes place in the future.<//Text>

<text>I liked this place because when I returned bulk rice after it gave me indigestion, they insisted that a store rule prohibited them from accepting a return (even if defective or unhealthy) So I explained that I was not there to get back a few dollars but just to let them know that the rice was green and unhealthy.Still they had a problem so finally I dumped it on the floor. Most exciting event happening in awhile.I love this place and they are usually very professional and friendly.<//text><name>Kenneth Brown<//name>< userid>

Best water in town.  Great alternative selection.  Deli and bakery is really good.  Prices are not bad, not good, but not bad. We always go here for eggs when we can't get on someone's back-yard-chicken list.</Text>

Best store in Redding! All organic produce, even local at times.

Employees are extremely nice and helpful.

Love the bulk honey and maple as well.

The ladies in the vitamin department know more then your doctor.</text>

I love shopping at the large health food grocery stores they are so much fun to wonder around in and just  look at all the interesting vitamins and groceries and orchard is no different ,but unfortunately looking is all the average person can do, because healthy and unprocessed is expensive  and orchards seem to be even a little more expensive then their contemporaries. With that being said  I am not sure orchards prices can be justified, but in all fairness I feel that most of the health food industry would be hard pressed to justify their gauging anyway. In a world where so many are either going hungry or being poisoned by genetically modified foods there entipeniral practices appears to be like black mail. I wreary of  hearing this industry criticize the medical world and their prices, and in the next breath ask some single mothers who dared to pause at the price of there better then ever 8 oz bottle of the newest healing elixir what she would pay for her health and that of her families.
The prices that the health food and the organic vitimine industry charges are unobtainable for the average budget.  SO I give them and all the health food industry a three star for being facinating and interesting but no higher  because I feel the entire industry denies  the ecconomically challenge fair  access to good nutrition and health and in so doing they show a lacks of humanity and integrity. They judge the medical world for the outrageous prices on medicine and services and yet they charge price that are just as outrageous with out the relief of medical insurence so for the most part I will just stick to Wal-Mart At least Sam Waltons legacy is preferable to living under a bridge while slurping up a containers of 16 oz 7.00 yogurt. NO THANK YOU!</Text>

The service is fast, prices are like anywhere else. I give it 3 stars because on the 1st drop with case on my screen broke which was the reason why I took it in for. It only lasted about 2 weeks. If the screen replaced was a good quality I am sure my screen wouldn’t of broken. The drop was from me sitting down, I had my baby and phone on my lap, grabbed my baby, forgot about the phone and bar broken screen.</Text>

They don’t!!! About a week later the screen had a line going from top to bottom. I took it back to them and they said it’s not the screen. They blamed me saying I probably pushed hard on the screen. I didnt argue with them because it wasn’t gonna to change there mind. Next time I’ll go to Repairology off Del Rosa.<//text>< pictures>

Shattered screen replaced in half an hour while I was waiting in the lobby reading Wired. Phone is back to normal. Great customer service, too. They deserve their high star rating on google.< /Text>

<Review>It's good except my order even though we told the girl the order about three times it still was wrong but I know it was confusing and we probably did make it harder then it had to be.  Also we just went thru the drive thru so it prob was a lil harder to hear.  She did repeat the order I think it was just confusing all the way around besides all the 100s of other times of going there that is the first time it ever was wrong.  The food is great as a matter of fact for the first time the other day I tried the wet burrito it's bomb and huge no worries service is always great and so is the food</Review>< pics>

Found out today they changed their fried zucchini with some awful new kind. The new recipe looks and smells like fried mozzarella sticks and taste like nothing more than batter with little to no actual zucchini in them. Absolute garbage. Go back to the old recipe or you will soon be losing a valued customer who would consistently eat at this restaurant at least once a week. The Patty melt and burgers were still good. Would have gotten at least a 4 star if it wasn't for the other mentioned change.< /Review>

Great value for the price. I got the small fries which was enough for 2 sides or almost a meal by itself. I prefer my fries slightly crispier, so next time I will ask for that.

The seasoning is very balanced on the fries and they almost don't need any dipping sauce.<//Text>

They have great food but I find it very rude when they start to put stuff away like the huge signs right in your face especially when your eating and it was only 9:45pm 15 minutes till closing time. Seems like employees care more about leaving early then caring for there customers.<//Review>

We're new to the neighborhood decided to give it a try for breakfast. Veggie omelet disgusting dont do it! its not even an omelet 1st of all. Flat egg wrapped around raw veggies disgusting no flavor what so ever. WITH CUCUMBER🤢 IT WAS HORRIBLE. We also got pancakes which were ok not that bad. The breakfast was good though.<//Review>

Food is ok. I ordered a patty melt and it didn't come with grilled onions, which is generally part of the patty melt. Had to ask for the onion to be added on. Also asked to add lettuce and tomato and got charged extra for it. Food's a bit overpriced in my opinion, but still an ok burger joint.< /Text>

<Review>My girlfriend and I found this place after living in Cerritos for over a year and it is a life saver. There aren't very many places to eat out for a quick grab other than your common fast food joints like Jack In The Box or Arby's. We decided to give RC Burger a shot after seeing it tons of times. Turns out they have a gigantic menu with tons of options. It's literally like finding 4 restaurants in 1. We now come here on at least a weekly basis and the food and service are both excellent. Highly recommend!</Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Great neighborhood burger stand. Everything comes out fast and I go here for the breakfast burritos that they make with hashbrowns, cheese, refried beans, egg, and bacon. Yummy. Love the fresh salsa bar as well.<//text>

Honeslty great concept only thing is that when you go threw the drivethru you can see the cook making your food with no gloves and using a dirty rag to clean his hands in between topping on your food. Very gross... That is all</text>

<text>Way to stingy! I was mortified to see that I ordered a shrimp cocktail and had absolutely no shrimp. I put my spoon into this monstrous cup of pure water. I poured all the water into another bowl to see how many shrimp if any were in there. After the cocktail cost me 12$ they gave me a full cup of cocktail juice with hardly any veggies and 10 medium shrimp. Not even large shrimp. I talked to a friend she said they did the same to her with the albondigas ( meatball) literally just 1 meatball. That is ridiculous! The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because at least they gave me back my 12$ and I gave them their cup of juice back. It was just an inconvenience. Maybe the boss needs to go eat at Ceviche loco, or Tacazo, or El pescador so that he can see what a shrimp cocktail actually looks like. I should have known they specialize on burgers not coctails. But if your going to offer this as part of your menu do it right. NEVER AGAIN! :(< /text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

The best CU out there. Their lending criteria is amazing letting members get a second chance on credit. All the phone reps are nice and their interest rates are amazing. What more can you ask for.</Review>

<Review>I have been a member for  37 years.   Signed up  Ithen I was stationed in Naples Italy.  They have provided great service no matter which location I have used.   The staff is always friendly.  We have used many of the services provided.  The check card is useful on all my international travels.  I'm glad they offer family signups to become members.   This has also been a great benefit.    Look forward to the continued service.  Thanks< /Review><Date>1571693938635</Date><Name>Ruben Marquez<//Name>< Rate>

The hours suck, they close too early I can never make it on time, their new deposit rule is horrible. If you deposit your check directly in the bank you have to wait several days to receive the full amount, there's people out there that need their money right away once they deposit it. I feel like switching banks due to this.<//review>

There were three tellers open and everyone was close to them. My teller told me I had to stay stand behind a blue line and gave me a look.

This is by far the best bank in the world. Best accounts best interest rates. They have given me that light at the end of the tunnel that there are banking institutions that care about their customers and to make them happy and not about the fees.< /Text>

<Text>I really wish they would update their ATM software/Hardware in drive thru and walk up ATMs are so slow doing transactions their ATMs are so old and outdated what's supposed to make banking more convenient makes it inconvenient!

And the drive thru ATM is so far into the building that whether in a car or truck you have to hang out the car and open your door to reach the atm! Needs redesign Improvements this Credit Union is becoming very outdated and they are not investing any money into structure upgrades or hardware/software upgrades on their ATMs< /Text>< date>

<review>Normally we have great service when we have gone into the branch. But when my husband went in to make a wire transfer (international) they (receptionist) had him sign in and wait for almost 40 mins before they explained that, that branch doesn't complete the wire transfer and he has to drive to Temecula. The receptionist should have the basic knowledge of what that branch is capable of. Very disappointing.</review>< userid>

<Review>Although the bank isn't very populated around So C a l. Their customer service has been super. Once they caught that a particular business had charger me twice for one single purchase. A substantial difference in the chargers and they caught it and red flag ged the account and contacted me immediately to inform of the second transaction. Thanks Navy Federal<//Review>< pictures>

This place is filled with people who are ignorant as much as they are confident. I have had issues with this branch specifically losing my paper work and having me have to drive back to that branch numerous times to resign the same piece of paper multiple times because they cant seem to keep track of it. And then when I asked them about it they acted like it was my fault. Like I did their job wrong.< /Review>

<Text>My awful experience:
I walked in with my family today and this old lady who claims to own part of this place insinuated I was going to steal a $10 jacket that had a weird stain on it. I bought it for a Halloween costume, but she was so rude and kept watching me until I payed for it. She even told the staff to watch over us because she thought we were going to steal. This woman thought me and my parents were going to steal from Goodwill. We had just come from church so we were dressed nice, it couldn't have been that we look like from the hood or anything like that. I am guessing it was because we were talking Spanish to out parents. But seriously if you are a business owner you should know to hire security so that kind of stuff doesn't happen in your store because apparently it's a problem if you have to sit there and watch people. Like even if I was going to steal what could she have done? She's a small old lady! What, was she going to tackle me? If shoplifting is something you're worried about hire security. Don't sit there and harrass a teenager shopping with his parents. Never shopping there ever again, but I didn't feel like going to another Goodwill. I didn't buy anything else because I refuse to give them any more of my money. The cashier was really nice. Everything was affordable, or maybe not according to some of these other reviews but then again I don't shop at Goodwill. Place was well organized. The furniture was ok, but the couches has stains on them. Parking was awful. Also as you can tell, there is minimal security. I don't even recall seeing a security camera anywhere. Shop at your own risk for harassment.<//Text>< gmapID>

Uncomfortable. Too crowded. I had many people who physically brushed past me. Checkout area poorly marked & slow,  & they don't want you looking in the glass cases cuz you'll be too close to others. Then don't fill them!< /Review>

<review>Their items here a decent, decent prices, but what makes this location is the staff. Very friendly employees here, every single time I've come in. Wish I could say the same for the Goodwill down the street (Fairoaks).. maybe management here should provide some much needed training to them in customer service.< /review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

<Text>Prices are ridiculous for some things, but that's Goodwill management, in the other hand some of the staff members lack service skills rude and make you feel like they're doing you a favor.

<Text>I was hesitated to stop after reading this reviews but glad I still did.  Everybody was nice and friendly! Found everything I needed here!  Will come back and visit when I return back to Pasadena.  Found a Betsy Johnson purse for 14.99 and heavy thick jacket for 9.99.  Love it here!<//Text><Name>Phyllis Mena</Name>< Pictures>

It is a decent size store. Seems to be well organized, I went early on a Thursday morning. The shoe racks are in order by color. They have a variety selection of shoes for women. The shoe rack for men is a very small selection and seems to have a lot of big sized shoes. The furniture selection was pretty good from what I saw. For the childrens department, there were about 4 racks of clothes, most for other kids sizes 5/6 and up. Parking for this location is limited so good luck on a busy morning like Thursdays. Over all I would say some of the stuff I found were over priced to be second hand. I walked out empty handed, didn't find much of a bargain.<//Text>

< Review>
I been coming here for years but never had such poor service from a MANAGER, I didn’t get his name, but he was a Hispanic young man with poor management skills and bad way of talking to a person. I am surprised by the level of service with this location. And he said he was a manager!!! So sad to encounter such way of handeling his supposed store. I will never donate to this store ever again.</Review>

<text>I came in here looking for an ugly Christmas sweater and that's exactly what I found($10). The selection here is far better than the Out of the Closet on Colorado. The prices were a bit more than expected but the quality over all was in the lightly used category. The children's section was great with a variety of toys as well.
Parking is horrible, tight turns and little room.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x80c2dca6728d9339:0x40d07ee584193427< /gmapID></record>

I have been coming here for many years and the staff here were great before!
The new staff and store manager are very rude. No customer skills at all. Please Goodwill change your staff immediately. Loosing customers is as much hurtful as loosing money.
Store Manager must go!< /Review>

Honestly one of the best thrift shops that I have been to in my entire life, and I am someone who loves Goodwill wherever I am in this country. The supply for this store is so great they fill many dumpsters a day with stuff they couldn't take, and they have new stuff coming out on the floor on roller carts roughly every 20 minutes. I think part of what makes the selection so good here is the proximity to very expensive parts of E. Pasadena, although I usually see hoodlums like myself shopping there. The​ record selection is pretty insane here; I have yet to get a portable turntable but have seriously considered it for this store alone. There is always a tag of the day which costs one dollar, so tons of people come in as regular and just hunt the dollar deals as a stress reliever/cheap shopping activity. The plastic bags they use are huge, and I'm not kidding when I say they work both as a kitchen trash bag and as a rain poncho. If you like to shop vintage and live in or around Pasadena (it is on Metro Bus line 181), definitely check this Goodwill out and you won't regret it. Plus, you're helping employ a bunch of people who really need it. Win-win!</text>

<text>This is a small to medium sized Goodwill location, but decently laid out. It has a medium clothing area, large selection of CD's, DVD's and VHS tapes, small to medium size electronics area, and small to medium size household items.  The manager seemed very helpful, the employees were relatively nice, the parking lot is medium sized and you will probably have to wait a few minutes for a parking spot to open.  This location is relatively busy and popular for such a small location.</text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

<Review>I used to come to this place all the time but the prices are ridiculous. They jack up the prices and all the items sold are free donated items. Not worth coming here anymore you get better items on the offer up app.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80c2dca6728d9339:0x40d07ee584193427<//GmapID></record>

Hey everyone, I am a collector and hit the jackpot at this store last week. Why for 3 weeks, no one purchased the odd ceramic container under the glass is my gain. So for $40 I bought what I thought was really old and guess what?! It is...It turns out a rare piece of Neolithic Chinese ceramic pottery that was dated by an archeology expert to 3,500 BC and the real thing! Thank you Goodwill!<//review>

I was in the market for a new mattress I was told they had some at affordable prices so I went in and immediately the guy of course started showing me some at astronomical prices (for me) so I said come down I told him what I wanted and well here's the photo my queen 👑 size memory foam it's firm and it's mine.< /Text>

<Text>Ordered two mattresses, box springs, and bed frames. Once delivered I only received the mattresses and platform frames (instead of the box springs and frames). No one contacted me about the changes of my purchase and was told by the delivery guy  this was all that was available after I had paid for two complete bed sets.

The platform frames I received are AWFUL!! The mattresses  really need the extra support from the box springs and sleeping is so uncomfortable because you can feel every cross bar on the platform frames.  I have had to spend extra money to replace the platform frames for the box springs and frames I had originally purchased.</Text>< pictures>

Great service, great prices. Bobby is super easy to deal with, not at all pushy like some of the other furniture/ mattress stores we visited while looking for a new bed. Highly recommend!< /Review>

I took my family here to buy everyone new beds and Bobby Ross helped us. He was very knowledgeable on the products and availability he had to offer in the store. He was very patient with all 3 of our children as they picked out their beds and extremely helpful. I highly recommend going here and talking to him. He didn't pressure us into buying anything and genuinely cared to help us get what we wanted for a price we could afford.<//text>< Pics>

ABSOLUTELY the BEST customer service I have ever experienced!  Had an issue with a previous purchase... and they excelled on how they handled the situation.  I have NEVER had such positive customer service in my lifetime.. and I’m a little grandma with many years of exposure to customer service.  THANK YOU!!  THANK YOU!!
Will always refer people to your store.  In addition, the quality of furniture and beds is outstanding!!< /text>

Took weeks for items to arrive at the store so if you buy from here its probably better to get something they already have. They did deliver though and assembled the furniture before they did so I really liked that. Good people that work here.</Review>

This is my second time going to the outlet and I can't say enough good things about my experiences! The first time I bought my daughters entire bedroom set and this time I did my living room and a mattress! They go above and beyond to make sure that you leave a happy customer! I would highly recommend buying furniture here over anywhere else in town! Their prices are affordable and their quality is high! Plus their customer service is outstanding!! Thanks again D!< /text>

Got a killer deal on the perfect bed for us. We did research and shopping around but we could have save lots of time and effort just buying from Comfort Zone from the start. Very grateful for the knowledgeable help without any pressure into buying. Highly recommended by myself and spouse. Thank you Comfort Zone!< /review>

I purchased a matress and bedframe from this Comfort Zone and it is one of the worst customer service experiences. This is the second time the bedframe failed in under two years. It took me two weeks of calling nearly everyday to get a hold of the owner, Bobby, to try to get the bedframe fixed under warranty. Everything is done via paper and the owner told me he did not keep the records and it was basically my problem. If he did this to me, chances are is he will do this to you.<//Text>

When I mentioned I was looking for a sleep Chair for my elderly Mother,  Bobby immediately knew what I was looking for. He ordered me what I needed. Delivery was just awesome. The guys who put the chair together were friendly and showed me how to work the controls. I couldn't hope for anything more. The best place in Redding for furniture needs.</text>

<Review>I stopped by here to visit a friend.  It was the first time I visited this store.  I took the time to wander around and look at the furniture.  The furniture seemed to be good quality and the prices were reasonable.  When it comes time for me to purchase a piece or two, I will go back.  The staff was also very nice which I rate heavily.<//Review>< Pics>

We moved to Redding and unfortunately did not bring all our home furnishings with us.  We stopped on Friday late afternoon and explained we had a budget for a new bed and wished to get one as soon as possible.  The owner was able to stay within our budget (even not charging us full price for some items) and was able to deliver our new bed the next day mid day.  The delivery gentlemen graciously called and kept us informed of their estimated arrival time and were fast and courteous when delivering our bed.  We would HIGHLY recommend Comfort Zone Mattress Superstore to anyone shopping for a new bed.  FABULOUS customer service!!!!</review>

Looked all over for a good deal and a legit sales person. This is the place !!! The owner was extremely helpful and knowledgeable. He also cut us some great deals and informed us where to get better deals on things like sheets instead of swindling us into buying his. Although his were better, he understood our circumstances. All together I highly recommend shopping here for a bed and furniture to come apparently!<//Text>

They went out of their way to make sure we found the bed which best suited our budget and comfort. The staff was friendly and informative. We went to every other bed store in town and I promise you the prices there are UNBEATABLE!</Text>

<text>My husband and I finally found an awesome comfortable bed  with Comfort Zone,  we also saved over $500 on the mattress we have been searching for, we bought it Saturday and it was delivered Monday and even took the old mattress away.  If you need a new bed, shop there! Lots to choose from and great prices.</text><user_name>B Kieffer< /user_name><Rating>5< /Rating>< Pics>

<review>My wife Stephanie and I purchased our new bed (which we love) from the Outlet. Delbert and the crew were top notch with their service! From their knowledge of the inventory down to the all the small details they were able to perfectly fit us into our new comfort. I love the fact that Delbert told us to take it home and give it a 30 day run to make sure we love it. He was able to get us into an awesome finance plan which i thought wasnt going to be possible. I have been to many “Big Box” stores and they gave me the feel of they dont care what would be the best deal for us, but how much could they make off us. Never had that feeling at the Outlet, i geniunely feel that their main goal is to fit your needs within your means. By doing that they create a great relationship for life. They have a customer for life with us, i reccommend them to all my friends and family!</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x54d2ec89eba9de71:0xb7cf4d1e2e4f947a<//gmapID></record>

They have the absolute worst customer service and when your talking to them the prices constantly change. If you shop around you can absolutely find better prices almost anywhere else in town. So do your research and don't let them take advantage of you. They're incredibly shady salesman.<//Review>

<Review>I can’t thank Delbert enough for all he did to get my mother into the right bed. Sounds like a simple task, right? Not when your mom has mobility issues and had fallen out of the first bed I chose for her twice, hitting her head and injuring herself the second time it happened. Not only did he exchange the first bed set I’d purchased, but he spent the time to find the right mattress and box spring set that was not only safe, but incredibly comfortable and he explained the differences of the mattresses and the reason why he suggested the set he did and the need for a low profile box spring. Yup, it’s like she went from driving on 75 series AKS tires to some Michelin Pilot Sport 50 series lol. And, just like it’s more expensive for lower and better..alas..there was a big price difference with the perfect bed set. :( But, then he said, “Merry Christmas. This way you have one less worry to think about.”. My mom hasn’t stopped talking about how happy she is with our experience here. I can’t say thank you enough. For someone to care about my moms well being as much as he genuinely did, is something I’ll never forget. Thank you so much. Also! I didn’t grab his name, but a gentleman who also works there had to get Delberts assistance with a sofa for another couple there, and he came back over to my mother and I and was thoughtful and caring enough to apologize for have to do so and I thought that was pretty darn badass, too. :) Thanks again, fellas.</Review></record>

They have great prices for their mattresses, and for every budget. I take my sleep very seriously, and spent a good amount of time in this store. Owners are knowledgeable, patient, honest and respectful. Would definitely purchase again in the future. Thank you!</text>< pictures>

<Review>We came after closing time, by coinsident the manager came at the same time to check something. He let us come in and buy a matress and even lended us straps to tie it to our roof rail. He also has BSSM discounts. Highly recommended, great people.< /Review>< Pictures>

Decided to give them a try using Postmates. Ordered 5 different noodles dish and fried rice. Waited a little bit over an hour for the food to arrive. And when it did there was on dish missing. We got the broth for it but nothing else. All the noodle dish had the Same exact ingredients, even though we were specific on what we wanted since one of my family couldn’t have pork. They still added pork to it, so he couldn’t eat it for dinner. Overall the broth was blah, and I wish they could have packaged it more nicely.<//text>

The food here was delicious. We had the Thai chicken basil entree and the green curry beef. Both were very tasty. The Thai basil chicken was by far the best part of our order. Highly recommend.< /Review>

The pork belly is delicious! Only problem was I am traveling for work and they gave me a receipt with no prices or total on it. Needs better receipts for business travelers!< /text>

The pork belly looked like road kill burnt beyond recognition.
It was disgusting.
I paid for the meal and left without eating it. I didn’t want to be unkind
I saw the place and I like to try hole in the wall restaurants.
It’s a risk that I take. I won’t risk here again.< /Review>

I was desperately hungry after flying all day and stopped in by chance. I got a Thai tea, Pinky Shrimp, and Crispy Pork Belly.  The shrimp was aromatic and tender. The pork belly melts in your mouth after a couple of crunchy bites. Delicious! Added bonus - my food came in vented to go boxes so it stayed crispy and fresh until i got home! I'll go out of my way to try this place again.</text>

<Response>None<//Response><Time>1525013488742</Time><text>I went there when it wasn't so busy so the food was pretty good, service were great, and waiting for your food was decent wait. Only problem, that the whole area of businesses runs by cash, so it attracts a lot of beggers. NOTICE that i said BEGGER'S not HOMELESS people, i mean some of them are well dress and they either there asking for food, beer or gas and they chase you to the store or chase you to your car at the parking lot. Pretty annoying, all the business over there need to do a meeting with the owner and hire a security guard or police patrol to stop these begger's from interfering their businesses.< /text>< user_name>

I adore this spot! They offer first-cleass meals, their menu is rich, The cook in that place is a real authority in the kitchen, I love a lot tasting all their food. The food is always tasty, the service towards the guests  is helpful. I often eat in this restaurant and I not even once was unsatisfied. I recommend it to all my friends.<//Text>

I ordered the drunken noodles on a whim last night and when they got delivered I could not believe how good the food smelled. It was spicier than I expected but that just kept me wanting to eat more of it, so many flavours going on that I can't wait to eat here in person.<//Text>

<Review>The pho here is pretty good! Pad thai is good too! Pork belly is crispy and delicious but im not a pork fan. Customer service is there, and much better than most pho places. Parking gets packed at certain hours. Just disappointed about the (nam tok) as it was very plain. I do recommend the pho!< /Review>< pictures>

< review>
Not the best place to go for Thai; but I guess it depends on what you get. I got the Rad nah with chicken and sticky rice. It was supposed to come with a thick gravy sauce; instead, the sauce was very watery and obviously had too much oil because I could clearly see the separation of oil and water. Not only that, the noodles were even less appealing. I could barely keep any on my fork and ended up using a spoon halfway through. It was still good but I won't be coming back here again.< /review>

Visited on May 5, 2019.

From the look outside, it doesn't seem too appealing, but when you get inside, it's quite a cozy little restaurant. The restaurant had a very homely type of atmosphere and there are probably enough to fit 30-40 people in.

Aside from the atmosphere, Mama's Asian Noodle House has a bunch of Thai/Lao food which will make your mouth water. As a family of 6, we ordered about 3 orders of the pork belly, and to be quite honest, I think we should've ordered atleast 4! The pork belly was so tender, so crispy, and so delicious that it was almost addicting.

My dad ordered some type of pho and that too tasted marvelous. I don't know the exact name of the pho, but I am assuming most their phos will taste just as good. The rest of the family ordered the fried rice (beef & shrimp ($2.00+ extra)) and I think it's better to order the shrimp. Both tasted fantastic and can rival fried rice from other places. Last, my family ordered the papaya salad (watch out, it's spicy), and they said even though it was spicy, it was really good.

We rate the restaurant as 5/5, taking inputs from my family. This place is a great place to visit!< /Text>

Great restaurant! I've been here several times. The style of food is very unique, not just your typical Vietnamese pho place. It seems like the chef was maybe trained in culinary school, as the menu covers a lot of ground. But everything I've tried here, from the pho, to the curry, to the typical spicy chicken entree, all of it is very tasty, as well as VERY aesthetically attractive.
The women waiting on you are very friendly and attentive, prices are very fair... what else can you ask for? You definitely need to try this place when in the mood for some Asian food that's a little outside the box.< /text>

<text>Service was extremely friendly and attentive. I was very happy with how quick our orders were taken and waters refilled.

We got the Thai boat noodle, crispy pork belly, and pad see ew.

The good:

Crispy pork belly was indeed crispy and overall good. But if you've ever been to LA and had some from Sam woo, you'll know that the pork is not as tender as it could be. The skin was slightly stale (too much chew, it should break apart a little easier). Even so, it is not a bad dish. B-

The pad see ew was flavorful with a good amount of meat and veggies. Noodles were more on the Al dente side which is something I prefer even though pad see ew usually has softer noodles. Nothing phenomenal, still good execution, B+.

Bathroom and interior is well lit and clean.

The bad:

The Thai boat noodle was so damn salty. It had way too much of the soup base. I like my noodle soup with the ingredients kind of unseasoned, it balances a flavorful broth. That is not the case here.

We went so far as to remove the noodles and meat out of the soup. And you could still taste the broth (and salt!) in the ingredients.

I think they overshot the time the rice noodles need in boiling water and, personally, I don't think the water needs to be salted. Maybe a little would be okay, but the Thai boat base was already too much to handle.

Thai boat noodle gets a D.

Parking is easy, area isn't super nice, but that can't really be helped. I'd come again, but I wouldn't make a grand effort. Overall, it was okay, C+.<//text></record></dataset><record>

The girl she pretty and friendly but that was it. The food is in needs improvement compared to others Asian noodle soups restaurants. Added bok choy to the noodles soup is no good. Cuz it changed the tasty of the noodles. My suggestion is asking the customers regarding the added bok choy or set it on the side like the bean sprouts. Will I go there again? No!!  Maybe someday when it improves</Text></record>

<Text>I should be up front - I usually like Domino's. I don't expect them to produce real pizza. But I love their thin crust pizzas. They are usually good and at least warm. This location has a different kind of consistent product though.

Their stated delivery times are  consistently off by 45 minutes or more.
They consistently get any delivery order coming to me wrong.
They consistently drop one or more of the pizzas in my order, often leading to pizza being inedible.
Everything in my order is consistently cold. Probably not surprising, since it's always so late.
Possibly because the pizzas have sat in the box so long before getting to me, the crispy thin crust pizza is more of a soggy cardboard texture - highly unappetizing!
My complaints to this location have never resulted in any apology, reparation, or improvement.

I've been burned (by the service - no chance of being burned by the pizza, unless it's freezer burn) by the service at this location several times now.  I'm slow, but I've finally learned. My business is going elsewhere. I suggest yours should too.<//Text>< gmap_id>

Not sure if they are understaffed or what, but I ordered pizza last night about 10 and didn’t receive my delivery order until after 11:45. I’m located only 1.7 miles from the dominos location....... pizza was warm but soggy. I don’t recommend delivery at this location.</text>

My son's favorite pizza,lol I like it to but there's a couple other's I prefer. But I love their hot sandwiches and their pizza crust I have to say is awesome, it's such a buttery flavor crust. I would go back anytime. P.S. If you're a chocolate lover, you must get their lava cake! 😁😋<//text>

Order food from the (2 pasta bread bowls) then arrived with almost no pasta or chicken, they looked like someone threw it together with there eyes closed. Upon reaching out to them I was informed they had no manager on site and there was nothing they could do.</Text>

Even though I like their pastas and pizzas, different employees cook my food it's hard to know how my food is going to taste like and that's a bit frustrating, sometimes my chicken wings are not fully cooked and that's disgusting or my salad is no fresh at all or the fact that my pasta doesn't have enough Alfredo sauce.</Text>

< Review>
I ordered pizza on the app to be delivered at 4:50pm. It is now 5:35pm and still have not received my order. I’ve been on hold to get an update for 15 minutes and as I’m typing this the answering service hung up on me. I usually have had an okay experience... but this is ridiculous. Never again

Update 6:07pm

Pizza still not here and when I spoke to the employee (manager not on duty), although professional and nice enough, did not even offer an apology. I’m completely speechless.</Review>

<Review>Well, obviously I can't speak for every Dominos, or everyone's experience, but with me, the staff were very friendly, food was made correctly, and within the time frame they provided. Keep it up!

Edit: Domino's has canceled my order three times when trying to get a delivery. The first time it was out for delivery, but they canceled after they were in the process of delivering it. The second time they were prepping it but canceled it. The third and final time, they accepted it and canceled it immediately.</Review>< pics>

<review>Worst place I've ever experienced.  First they delivered 2 cheese pizzas... MINUS THE CHEESE.. and nearly 4 hours to re-deliever their mistake. Did not comp either.

Decided to try again today... unsure why,  but I gave them the benefit of the doubt and decided to pick up instead of have them delive . They AGAIN messed up the order and gave us something we didnt order. When we asked to talk to the new assistant manager, she was extremely unprofessional and used horrible and unacceptable language... as if we were the problem. YOU MESSED UP OUR ORDER 2 NIGHTS IN A ROW... called hack and was hung up on twice! ... they atleast refunded the money after we returned the untouched pizza. Worst excuse of a business.  10/10 would NEVER recommend
how do they have any decent reviews!?<//review></record></dataset><record>

They never get on time. You get an email saying that delivery time is 20-30 minutes and they take hour and 30 minutes. Pizza is always cold and I have to put it on the oven first. Don’t order after midnight on the weekend, waste of time.<//review>

If you order delivery late night even if it is hour or 2 before close. It's a 50/50 chance you will actually get your food. It happened 3 times to myself and a few times to other locals.<//Review>

Their pizza is whatever. Half their toppings are pretty bad quality. The pizzas are never really cooked well and whoever slaps them makes them super thin. What they need to do is get better dough and increase their oven time so the pizza cooks better. I asked for extra crispy didn't crunch at all but I used to work at dominoes so maybe I just like making my own. Regardless though toppings are 4/10</review>

Loved the driver that delivered our pizza! I requested someone to write happy birthday on our box and they definitely covered that. I went to go meet him at the door and he requested to see the birthday girl just to wish her a happy birthday. He also gave us some pointers in Napa and San Francisco as this is our first time in the city. Great guy and the pizza was good.<//review>

It's getting late, I'm getting hungry, so... I'll order Domino's. Grab my phone, place the order, confirm the order... 5 minutes later my phone is ringing, I answer, Domino's here , we closed early, sorry. You have hours of operations for a reason. The number of times I've been called only to be told we closed early is ridiculous. You can place an order and I guarantee that if it's within 20 minutes of closing, you will not get your order. I placed an order at 1243 tonight, missed the call they placed to me, at 1:01, the order suddenly cancelled, no voicemail, no explanation, nothing. I've gone out of my way to pick up orders when they couldn't handle deliveries, I tip my driver 20% or better all the time, and have little expectations. Like be open and operate within your posted hours. If you can't, close up shop and quit pretending! Good bye.</Review>

Order at 8:47 PM. Delivery estimate said 45-50 minutes. Called at 10 PM as order had not been received (though pizza tracker status online said order has been delivered). Was told on its way. Did not receive even at 10:30 PM. Had to cancel order. Store rep on phone was polite and apologized. Refund was promptly credited.< /Review>

Very convenient location and the pizza always comes out good but for some reason when they tell you it's ready for pickup I always have to wait 10 or 15 minutes more when I get there and when they deliver even though I live 2 minutes away I have to wait 45 minutes or more. One time I believe they even forget about me.< /text>

<date>1495222815715<//date><Response>None</Response><review>I ordered from the online app. The pizza was made very quickly and sent out of the store very quickly. After 40 minutes of waiting for the delivery driver who apparently had one other pizza to deliver according to  The person I spoke to on the phone... I started to get irritated.

Then I noticed that the tracker said my pizza was delivered! I was outside working on my car and no one had ever driven by. The person at the store told me we are very busy today he will be there any minute.

I was a delivery driver for a pizza place years ago, and no matter how busy we were never took 40 minutes to make two deliveries.

<Text>UNACCEPTABLE!!!!!!!!
It's Sunday we came to order pizza for carry out
But they are closed , both the website and the sign on the door says open at 10am on Sunday!!!

So I go to the door and knocked and Francisco answered saying they were closed because spencer the manager is late and Francisco has no way of contacting him or anyone else. This is a poorly run establishment not to say anything bad about the associates they are great and it's not there fault.

Seems it's time for more reliable management!!!
I arrived here at 10am and it's now 11am and still no manager!!!!!<//Text><user>111290024818384950062</user><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None< /resp>< date>

So I ordered a cookie brownie marble and not only was it not cut but I noticed some burns around the edge and I flipped it over to find it was completely burnt on the bottom! Absolutely disgusted. Not to mention that I never received my change and when I called to make a complaint they said the driver had no change on him!< /text>

<review>Ordered online on our way here. Takes 30 mins to get here from our house.  They called and said they have no black olives so we got mushrooms instead 15 mins later we go to pick up our pizzas because our app says its ready but our mushroom pizza isn't ready and our other is sitting out.

Called and told them exactly where I needed the pizza to be delivered, they said it was ok and they could deliver it. They called back 1 hour later after making the pizzas to say they don't deliver there....bullshit. Should have told me from the beginning instead of making me wait a whole hour getting hungry.< /text>

Ordered at 6:08, Tracker said pizza done at 6:18 & left for delivery at 6:30, by 7:12 it said it was delivered.  Did not actually arrive until 7:28 - called store and spoke to representative that said, "tracker is not actually realistic of the time" and when I mentioned it wa the worst time delay I've ever had and that I would recommend no one use this location his response was "alright".... so, worst experience ever for this chain. Pizza was nearly cold when it finally arrived and service was horrible.< /text>

Never order for delivery from this place.  The Dominoes Tracker said it left 48 minutes ago, just called and they said it left five minutes ago.  Will I ever get my pizza?  Maybe?  Maybe not...Get it together Dominoes.  I wish I had read the reviews before ordering.</text>

Uhoh. When you see a lot of writing, it's going to be a complaint!

Let me start with saying that the workers are all at least friendly and nice. The store is clean and in a nice location. The pizza tastes like it should with evenly-dispersed toppings and properly-baked crust and whatnot.

Here's the problem: Don't order from this Dominos if you want your pizza properly sliced. Most people don't care, I'm sure, if one slice is a little off. I don't. When it's bisected into a third and two thirds, it's a problem. When ten or more pizzas are ordered and they're all that way, it's a problem. When the same or similar order comes in every week at the same time from the same place and the pizzas are all still cut badly, it's a problem. One would think that some care would be put into making pizzas for repeat customers who spend over $100 per week on pizza orders. (Before you start thinking I'm a fatty - which I am - I'm not just ordering for myself.) I asked once for them to cut my pizzas evenly and nothing changed. This tells me that the Dominos workers don't care about the one product they're actually known for.

Thank you for for the good times, Dominos, but "You have failed me for the last time."

My name is Martin Reid, and this is my story.<//review>

<review>Wow, impressive. I mean literally the WORST experience IV had, even including all fast food "restraunts" IV visited in the past, I was first left on hold for over 45 mins, then repedidly hung up on, before I could even place my order, most likely because it's late and they didn't want to take another order, (I have seen them in the past leave the phone off the hook when it's late so they can't receive more calls) when I finally got VERONICA claiming to be  the "manager" which hopefully isn't true, because she was more than unprofessional, she was more then rude,  her first words being "what do u want" not even hello, I began to order and her rude tone progressed, as well as ignoring my order, i had to repeat my self 3 times, because i could here her talking with her coworkers in the background, after to much,  I asked her name, and to speak to the manager multiple times , she just kept saying u dont need to talk to the manager, and no im mot telling u my name, finally after i askd for the manager for about the fourth/fifth time, That's when I was told VERONICA, and I am the manager, I replied with thank you, I'll be writing u a review but I'd like to order a..... And she hung up on me again..
If I could rete my experience less then a star, I would, I don't ever take time to write reviews. But that VERONICA on the phone was just the rudest most UN professional person iv ever spoken with,, I understand everyone has a bad day every once In a while, but this was so much more then that.
That kind of service ID expect at a Vallejo liquer store,   but not in the food/service industry in Napa,   sorry VERONICA, I hope u find a job that better suits you, try to find something that doesn't include answering phones, or interacting with humans at all, that should work out in your favor.
But Defiantly go eat at Dominoes if u like to order while being yelld at, till you cry, you'll love this place XD<//review><rate>1<//rate></record></dataset><record>

How rude was that. Terrible customer servive by the cashier. I come from south central l.a. and even there the people arent as rude. Apr 7:03 pm.

<text>In a hurry to feed the kid on a weeknight I called for the first time. Pizza was OK, tracker was way off. I called the store 20 minutes after the tracker said my pizza was delivered and they said it was on the way. The pizza was delivered just about an hour after the tracker said it left the store which was about 35 minutes after it was ordered.
There are a lot of ways to get mediocre pizza in an hour and a half including cooking frozen...........I won't be back.</text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Visited here on January 19th 2021.  The experience was exceptional from beginning to end.  I didn't get a chance to catch the names of the people who worked with me because we arrived just in time for the cut-off time off 1:45pm for boat rentals and we were  rushing through until we could settle in on the lake.  Now I know where to go on weekends if I have a window of 3 hours.  It's nearby, yet worlds away.  Highly recommend.  Just please keep it as beautiful, clean, peaceful as it is.< /Text>

<Text>Gorgeous place, and very environmentally conscious as well!

Excellent for paddle boarding, boating, lounging by the beach, fishing, horse back riding, etc. If you do bring a boat or board or similar gear, you will have to have them inspected when entering the area to avoid contaminating the lake with invasive species. That means your gear MUST BE DRY or that equipment will have a one week ban from the park.

Highly recommend!</Text>< pics>

Rented a paddleboat. Reasonably priced. They allowed us to take our dog on the boat which was nice. Had to fight some winds so we didn't travel too far. Most of the shoreline is rather steep, but we were able to find a little beach where the dog could run around. Pretty crowded on a June day.<//Text>

It’s a good place to pend the day. In wintertime, the lake is not completely filled even though it's a good place to take the kids to fish.<//review>

Amazing place to spend your weekend. You can enjoy with a barbeque or dive into the lake or boating. The only cost is the parking fee which isn't too bad itself.<//Review>

But the little boat house where they rent out the equipment is pretty tight and takes forever to get through, even if you just buying a popsicle on a hot day... Someone needs to rethink that whole thing... But a really great place to go with your family... And they have a great campgrounds as well....< /Review>< pics>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Text>Boat was taged when i got to this lake and has been taged for past 4 years. Boats are to be off the lake at 8pm. I was off lake at 8pm and pulled off ramp to install straps. After straps were installed i drove over to boat inspection station to have boat taged before i left. The inspection ranger refused to tag boat saying i needed to be there at 8. There is nothing that says for you to be back there at 8 for tag just off lake. I will be calling supervisors to inform them. It is very difficult to go through the process of getting boat taged for lake and A holes like Evan make me never want to go back to this lake. No other lake i have ever been to has people like this working there.  But i guess going home early is more important!! Thanks Evan... thanks to you im off any lake till the boat is dry. So much for a good place to go boating!!!< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

(Translated by Google) It was a beautiful day but the structure of the beach does not work all year round. But the marina was running and renting boats.

<text>Well organized and efficient. Great service from an Apple customer service rep named Erica from Tracy. She was excellent at her job, friendly, engaging and very knowledgeable about Apple products. I owed many businesses in the past and know how important it is to have good customer service and she's a keeper.< /text><GmapID>0x808fec74252fce31:0x21f56841128fdba3</GmapID><Rating>5< /Rating>< userid>

<Review>Apple won’t reconsider a return of purchase during covid time. Bought an item that wasn’t used but opened. Unable to return due to Covid sickness that left my mother in hospital for 2 months and 3 months at rehabilitation. Katelyn Manager wasn’t helpful at all.

Pretty long waits standing in line, even for previously scheduled pickup appointments.  Not sure what the problem is, but this store is currently chaotic.  Maybe as pandemic rules are relaxed service levels will improve.< /Review>

I had to return an online item at Ann Taylor, and the store at the mall was closest to my home. Good amount of stores with lots of items to select... but overall, it was too crowded for my liking. Even though everyone was wearing masks, it just didn't feel comfortable with that many people walking and shopping. It's an indoor mall and people who were walking near or passed you were clear less than 6 feet apart.< /review>

Great place to fix your apple id issues. If you can't access your old apple id, then the next option is to create a new one.</text>

<review>Super Quick Service Today (11/3/2020). Was worried and warned by friends that I'd need an appointment... But I saw the only appointment was a week away, so I figured I'd try my luck.  They got me right in after a quick interview.  It was maybe a 3 minute wait. Then Solved my airpods pro problem and out Super Fast!

Store was very busy and I had to wait in a long line, but all the employees were working hard to take care of everyone.
I had the privilege of being helped by Nima, who was fantastic. Very knowledgeable and took the time to answer all my questions about my new phone and all the other products I was inquiring about. His enthusiasm about the products in the Apple Store really made me feel good about my purchase and I will be returning to buy a couple iPads based on the info he gave me about the new ones.
Great experience. Great new phone. Thanks Nima!</Review>

Eric (Erik?) assisted me with a trade in and purchase and HE WAS AMAZING. I had a credit card issue and during my 20 minute call, he played ROCK paper scissors with my VERY active 10 year old. Was super patient and had her laughing the entire time. Sometimes people don’t realize just how much that. Little bit of interaction helps a mom stay at ease when dealing with stupid credit card la locking your account. Thank you Eric!< /review>< rating>

Poor experience with Genius Bar considering I had appointment and followed each step of process. Waited 2 hours and explained issues, but in the end no service was provided to aid malfunctioning product (in this case a connection issue with AirPods Pro’s). Tough to blame the workers considering this may have been an issue due to pandemic, but had higher hopes for a company like Apple, that puts emphasis customer/consumer experience.</Text>

<review>Phenomenal service by Vanessa. I had an unexpected phone issue that could have taken weeks to fix. She went out of her way to speak to Apple representatives outside the store and get me a new phone the same day so I could have it ready for work.

<review>It was very confusing when I first got there. I was supposed to have an appointment at 1:30 I had three sales order quotes on my phone and they couldn't figure out who did it but the people on the floor of the store were extremely helpful from pretty efficient they getting it all together and getting me the phones so what could have been hours turned out to be somewhere between last certainly less than an hour. So I'm a happy customer<//review><response>None<//response><Rating>5<//Rating>< pictures>

I had some technical difficulties with a phone I bought recently (unfortunately I’m having short term memory loss & I don’t remember the names of the kind workers who helped me out) but the service was excellent, once someone was available I was promptly helped & the manager also assisted to ensure that my problem was well taken care of. Thank you!</text>

Dropped off my machine to be repaired back in March. Covid happened and they closed for months. Nobody from the store contacted me regarding my repair until I called 3 months later once they opened. Got a hold of someone they asked me what the repair was for and claimed they didnt have notes on the repair! Thought we were sorted on the said call but was called the next day to see if I “still wanted the repair” wth!? On this second call I was told “the parts arrived but not sure what is broken - cant find notes” both calls it seemed as tho the people were reading from a script and not using common sense - after that call I received an email stating the parts had arrived but Id need to bring my machine in?!!?! Apple store has stollen my 3k macbook pro!!! They have had it since March!! Consumers beware this store can not be trusted</text>

If only I could give it a zero rating. So I went to this store around 6:30pm with the intention of replacing my iPhone battery. When I checked in, the clerk told me that someone will help me within 20 minutes. 30 minutes gone by and no one came to help me. So I checked with the clerk again and he told me to wait for 5 minutes. However, another 20 minutes gone by and I still haven’t been help. Every time the clerk would just tell me that I will be the next in line and I just need to wait for 5 minutes more. While in the mean time there were 3 to 4 people getting called before me. It wasn’t unit after 90 minutes that I was finally able to ”speak” with a clerk (which was around 8 pm). The most frustrating part was that the response I got was that they were about to close in an hour and they don’t have enough time to switch out my battery for me. So they basically told me to come in again to drop off my phone the next day (which was a 40 minute drive for me). This store prioritizes customers that have a higher potential of making bigger purchases. I would definitely not recommend going to this store if your intention is to get your products repaired. They’re just going to put you on hold forever while they choose to serve the customers that are interested in purchasing new iPhones first. Worst services and experience ever, never going to this store again.<//Text>

It is my second visit to the store and i would say it has poorest customer service that i have ever seen in any store. Although i get my appointment and the agent do show up, then this store never have anything in their stock and always ask me to wait for a week or so And then come back again to check if i can get the simple  USB replacement or no.
I have visited few other stores in Walnut Creek or Palo alto, guess next time for anything required i will prefer to drive extra miles than to come up in this store and then come back again for getting my stuff.< /Review>

Apple store always gives unqualified great customer services. A team leader/technician named Christian had promptly solved a highly complicated technical problem on my IPhone, mainly because of his in depth knowledge and know how but his mannerism that is also strikes out a complete customer experiences. Great job!< /text>

<Review>Went in with a friend last week to have their iPhone looked at since the speaker was not working on it. They said it would be about an hour wait. 3 hours later we went to T-Mobile and just got a new phone since they had to go get their kids from school. Still never got a text asking to come in. I guess it was more important to get people for the new iPhone rather than help someone who was just looking to get something fixed.</Review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

<text>I try and stay away from this spot at all costs!!  Talk about having the ability to take a simple fix and turn it into an all day event.  You're better off either calling in or taking your iPhone issues to a verified apple dealer/vender.</text>< Pictures>

Like I've always said, I think Apple makes some of the best Electronics Hardware on the planet. I don't quite admire their software set up nearly as much or I guess the overall structure of their operating system, but if you look at Apple just as far as the quality of the hardware that they produce, incredible.<//Text>

All employees at the Apple Store Stonrbriar are courteous, kind and helpful. I have been shopping here for years and always had a pleasant experience. Today I had a reservation to get my iPhone battery replaced. As always, greeted at the door with a smile,   Another helpful person ran diagnostics on my phone and about an hour later my phone was ready with a replacement battery. My phone runs like new again. Apple really knows how to treat their customers. Thank you.<//text>

< Review>
It's an Apple store, like all the rest. Sorry expensive over priced products, but the place is always very popular and busy. You know what to expect with Apple stores.
What you can also expect are very friendly staff who are super helpful. The products are well made and work well. I'm an Android guy myself but buying for a family member was very easy.<//Review>

Apple, just like any other company, is as good as the people that work over there. I got lucky with probably the best guy that works there - David. Empathy- is an asset that you either have it or not and David has it.<//text>

Great service, especially in weekdays when the shop isn't jam-packed.  Located in the middle of the mall on the first floor, so it almost doesn't matter where you choose to park. The worst thing about visiting is the propensity of leaving the store with a lighter wallet.< /Review>

Cool place for stuff and things you want but may not need. Prices are good but I guess they could be lower, or for that matter they could be higher. Staff was friendly or it could've been me being friendly in turn making them friendly. Also very helpful, But I don't think my questions were very difficult so it could have been easy for them to seem helpful. They may not be helpful at all. I left more confused than when I went in, and now have to carry another bag full of stuff I wanted and totally don't need. On to the next store, or maybe I should go home. I'm actually kinda hungry so I'll do a review of the place I go to from here. If I went home than I'm won't do the review.

Have a good Day! Well only if you see this and it's daytime, if it's in the night then. Have a Great Night! Geez, just thought of it. If it's morning time then. Good Morning!<//Review>

They stated it's 720p, but in reality it's 360p with a lot of smoothing that supposed to reduce noise produced by the camera. I asked them how is that possible, and they stated hat it's fine, this is by design. They didn't apologize or suggested any solution, with straight face just : there is nothing to fix. So don't be upset if you by something there and it won't work properly, since they will tell you it's by design.<//text><username>Alex S<//username>< Response>

<review>Thought going in..that there was no way i was going to get anyones attention...it was so busy. Mind you, this was the first time I've ever been in an Apple Store.
But, I saw one person in the middle of the store not talking with anyone so I approached her she immediately added me into her system with a minor description of what I was wearing and the location of where i was standing in the store  to wait  for the next available salesperson. WOW...it work!!
So going in I thought at best that I probably have to buy another iPad come to find out it's only that I had uploaded the next upgrade... this caused my system to not respond therefore I had to bring it in. Needless to say I walked out not paying a dime and I got my iPad to work in and out within an hour I thought that was pretty good thank you Apple Store!!</review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

love apple products and dont mind paying a premium but this store’s customer service is really bad. bought a new cable and was told if i bring in the old one they would replace it. it had only been 6 months since i bought it.  made a new trip out with 2 lightly worn but non working cables and was denied by the first person i spoke to.< /text>

i wanted something impossible, wish granted, allows very cool experience to flow as a result, super nice salesperson and technical guy was amazing, he answered ALL my questions, and i ALWAYS have a lot of questions.

in 30 minutes i went from zero to 100 in terms of satisfied customer, completely the way i wanted it to go, which is great, because i know exactly what i want/need, and go and try fulfilling that need (usually frustrated!) but in this case, nothing but smiles #thankyou<//review><Name>Jeff Bond<//Name><gmap_id>0x808fec74252fce31:0x21f56841128fdba3<//gmap_id>< UserId.>

<review>After I visited this store today, I totally lost trust for Apple. I went to the store twice for fixing iPhone 6 plus since the screen was shading and the phone was not working periodically in the past a few days. As the technician said this is a common problem for iPhone 6 plus and Apple has made an app/system for fixing it but I have to pay for $$ to get a replaced phone. I wondered if I should get a replaced phone or updated to iphone 7. The technician said I could think about it first and come back later. Later at night time I decided to get a replaced phone since l couldn't use the phone most of time. A store associate (unfortunately I didn't get her name) told me i couldn't get assistance today since I lost my chance to get help earlier and they had a lot of people ahead of me. She kept asking me if I understand or not. When I tried making a new appointment, she was very impatient and rude. She kept saying "you need to make your decision" and then walked away couple times in one minute when I tried making an appointment. I am so disappointed about this store and Apple products today. I don't expect to see so many customers need technical support on a week day!</review><pics>None< /pics><response>None<//response>< user>

Believe me, don't even to go there. It's useless.
I had been there three times for repairing my apple product. And every time they refuse to service me, only sign me for another appointment.(Even I had an appointment, they let me waited there for more than 20 minutes.)
I mean if I want to make an appointment I can do it in online, what the point I went there for a 30 minutes drive and waste gas and my car miles.
I had been a lot of apple stores in the U.S. in the past 7 years and none of them had this kind of service. I am not sure it's apple's going down or just I went the wrong place.
Also I do want to mention that in 2 weeks my iPhone having problem with GPS, my apple watch screen just fell off by itself, and my MacBook pro got memory cap And none of them got fixed.. I really feel sad for apple. What would you think about apple products if you experience those once in the same time.
As a loyal apple user, at this time, I really feel it's the time to rethink my position on apple product. Maybe it's the time to switch.< /review>

Must have an appointment to be helped. Then you wait for at least 20-30 minutes for a technician who doesn't know how to use an Apple 5. Sprint store was better.< /Text>

In a hectic store (which had appointments booked for a full week in advance), Tyler quickly and professionally helped solve issues related to my phone while also meeting the needs of other customers. Thanks for the assistance, it was a best case scenario in Apple location that clearly gets a TON of foot traffic!< /Text>

okay so Customer Service should really have a higher quality when dealing with customers..
and customer service people should be trained to be more friendly and helpful..
i just return from the Apple Store i was there about 5:45 PM and my Headphone "Studio Wireless" by Dre Beats need a repair for the same reason i repaired it last time!
so the process for repairing the Headphone that i face last time it was taking the headphone and comeback to pick it up two weeks later.
now he asked me to make an appointment online and then come back next week to give them my Headphone and wait two other weeks to received it!
i just drive for an hour for nothing ! couldn't they just take it now instead and sent it tomorrow or after tomorrow to the repair if they don't have time today ? and that will save the customer time .. and make him feel that the customer server of Apple (and Apple it self) does care about your satisfaction !
i hope Apple Hear my voice and try to upgrade there Customer Service
thanks for reading..<//Text>

<text>Apple used to be the epitome of Customer Experience. Now you are lucky to have a genius appointment where they even take the time to hear you out and address concerns. They have gone from providing that great experience that leaves you feeling warm and fuzzy to something much more transactional.

My "genius" was rude and had an attitude from the beginning of the interaction, and was straight to A or B. These are your options. I am used to at least being asked how am I doing today, what seems to be the problem.

I asked for a managers assistance so I could at least feel like I was heard. She passed me back to the rep after 2 minutes of interaction.

I suppose I at least know now to lower my expectations of what to expect when I make an appointment.</text>< Pics>

Just bought a new MacBook Pro which has been having intermittent screen issues. I have brought this item in following their appointment schedule to have my appointments cancelled because I was "5 minutes late" when I had been waiting there 10 minutes early trying to get the genius' attention who turned out to be rather incompetent.

I gave this place a second try after contacting a manager after being told that their appointments are "only 15 minutes" and being told to leave the area after 5 minutes of trying to explain what the issue with my laptop is to the incompetent tech.

Finally, I figured I'll let them fix the computer after bringing it in(my appointment was cancelled because again I was "late"...)

Four hours of my time wasted in this store, my computer is still not fixed.
My last visit to such a terribly organized location. I received my laptop back after handing it over to them when I was explicitly told that I would be receiving a new screen and motherboard/logic board(it's an SOC design so all the components are on the same board). I got it back today and none of these things were done. I was also told that they had run the same diagnostic as last time only to find nothing which was the same as last time...

Apple in Stoneridge Mall is mentally incapable of handling computer products and repair. This was my last visit. I will be trying another locale to get this resolved.</Text>

This is my go to place for any apple products purchase or repair. Every time I go here, it is crowded as hell. May be it’s because of the wonderful customer service. It’s ok to walk in directly if you are going for pick up or purchasing a new item. But if you are planning for repair, that’s not good idea with out an appointment.

The store people are friendly and courteous, answers and solves the issues with extreme knowledge/guidance on the products.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<Text>Lousy Genius Bar service.  I have a broken keyboard key on my MacBook Pro, which is still under warranty.  They refused to make sure that they have parts available before I go.  They wanted me to tell them the part numbers first.  It's THEIR product!  How am I supposed to know the part numbers of their product?  How do they know what part to order when I get there?   They should rename it to Idiot Bar.

I think I'll end up going there multiple times.  Maybe they just want to generate some more spontaneous shopping in their store.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Really busy on school holidays. Arcane appointment system required a phone call with very long holding, delayed call-backs after leaving a message, and then once you arrive for an appointment, you're supposed to wait in a line to check-in, only to wait even longer on a side of the store that lacks seating. Going to the Apple store fur a repair is like being stuck in an ER waiting room. They could improve this appointment system in so many ways.<//review>

Hard to believe that Apple, with all of its cash, brains, marketing and product prowess has created such a complete mess of its retail environment.  I hope I never have to enter another Apple store.  Nothing but a complete mass of humanity (which Apple probably thinks is cool) accomplishing virtually nothing except playing with overpriced gadgets and accessories.  I waited at their "Genius Bar" (boy what a name) for 30 minutes simply to exchange a product.  I had to physically express my frustration to get a manager to respond to me, who then ended up apologizing for the entire experience.  If you have to visit this store, bring a lunch and plenty of patience because you will be in there forever.< /text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Text>I went in to buy a watch and was literally ignored by everyone. I asked a guy walking around with an iPad (very politely) if there was someone who could help me, and he was rude about it. Asked me if I had checked in and told him no one had even approached me at the door or greeted me to do so. Gave me a “yeah, whatever” attitude.

The store wasn’t even that busy. There were almost more employees than customers at that point and literally 5 standing at the back of the store chatting and looking down at their iPads.

To make matters worse, I had another girl ask me if I had a Genius Bar appointment. In a condensing voice, she told me she only handled Genius Bar related stuff, when I told her I just wanted help buying a watch. Never even offered more assistance than that. I almost lost it at that point. Let her know I wasn’t happy and walked out without buying a thing.

The last straw was when I called to speak to a manager, rather than write this review, and nobody even picked up the phone.

Seriously, Apple?<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

<text>I can say with conviction this is probably the worst Apple Store I have ever been to. Staff varies between friendly but overworked, to completely disinterested and rude. The place is generally crowded, but I've seen plenty of other Apple Stores get by without the place turning into a riot by having *all* employees pitch in, not merely a quarter of them being helpful.</text>< date>

After going thru a overwhelmingly negative set of reviews I still chose to go to this store to repair my phone hoping my experience would be different. My phone’s limited warranty was also quickly coming to an end and hence I thought replacing the battery within the period would waive the charges for it which was also reaffirmed to me multiple times calling apple support and also their technicians. Some of my observations of this store based on my experience:

Most of the associates in the support team are very young and inexperienced - the first time I was late to my appointment and I was given a second chance to see the next available support technician within 15 minutes and I ended up spending half an hour and when I spoke to that person who assured me someone will see me in fifteen minutes, went thru the log and then stated that it will be longer since they were so backed up. Not sure why he couldn’t have told me this prior to me having to wait half hour there with no assurance anyone will show up.

The second time, a technician did see me and she told me that I will need to bring my phone and hand it over to them for the repair the next day since they were not taking in anymore work orders for the day. I was alright with that. I told her that I was on the last day of my warranty and that they should replace the battery with no cost to me as I was assured by apple support over the phone. She also confirmed that to be true and she showed me a page where the cost was indicated as zero dollars and asked for me to sign after reading the terms. Little did I know that she had also conflictingly stated that the battery replacement was to be charged since although I was under warranty, the battery report came out to be good and I insisted on replacing it anyway. The reason why I wanted the battery replaced was because it was draining very quickly even without me actively using the phone and I noticed this behavior after the latest OS upgrades.

The next day I went to give my phone for repair and the person that collected it also reconfirmed that I shall not be charged. All the whole they were entering a truly conflicting statement in their reports. When I went to collect the phone in the evening, the person that showed up with the phone insisted I pay for the battery and I refused stating that I have been told this is covered under warranty. Then the manager shows up with all the logs from the previous support folks clearly stating that the battery was to be charged while verbally they were telling me otherwise and getting me to sign the understanding that we had. The manager started making statements that this was a he said-she said thing and that the paperwork was clearly reflective of the cost associated with the new battery and legally am supposed to pay the fee.

I had been lied to multiple times in the store with multiple support staff claiming I don’t owe anything for the new battery while they have been entering a completely different thing in their notes. I paid for the battery and told the manager I will never come back to this store again. Even if I am crazy enough to buy another apple product it shall be online and for support I’d much rather go to the SF support centers.

Please avoid this store at all costs - or else read the fine print before you sign. These support staff are either too young and naive or grossly misleading not even knowing what assurances they are giving their customers.</Review>

Was visiting out of the area, and my phone completely bugged out and wouldn't charge so i happened to go to this store to try and get it fixed....my mistake...

First off, the greeters in the front were nice and helpful and directed me to go behind another customer who was with the appointment scheduler....and so I stood behind them patiently waiting.

Then another customer started standing off to another side of them...and I'm like okay...I was here first...then when the first customer  was done, I immediately went to the appointment scheduler (name is Grace)...and she rudely said that I wasn't next...and that there was a line. I kindly said I was there first....and there was no line when I initially stood. (it's not like there was a sign that says line was there...it's just open space and I had originally stood behind them to begin with).

And then she asked the other customer if it was okay if I went first...not even apologizing or admitting she was wrong...just accusing me I was cutting....when I was just waiting patiently with my girlfriend (which even my girlfriend was telling her I was definitely not cutting)

So I was mad, but breathed in and out and fast forward, I book the appointment, waited some more, and finally got with the Genius to help fix my phone.

The Genius was really nice so kudos to her, but said there is nothing that can be done with my phone...that I had to buy a new phone...and I told her I will think about it.

Ended up going to a repair shop nearby, and the battery just needed replacing...phone works perfectly fine...and overall, was just a waste of time, and plain rudeness from Grace, which left a bad taste in my mouth for Apple Customer Service.

Going to give Samsung a chance soon since this was just uncalled for in multiple instances.< /Text>

<Text>I am regretting buying Apple products after my experience with Apple store. My iPhone6 died while under warranty and I took it in to fix. First rep gave runaround that they couldn’t take it overnight for repair. Said I could buy a new phone and return it within 30 days while my other is getting fixed. Took it in different day. Second rep tried giving same runaround. At this point I was firm on Apple taking it for repair. Rep ended up giving me new phone instead. So to summarize: I wasted 2 hours, Apple ended up with 2 refurb phones to get rid of. All because of incompetent staff and messed up process.< /Text>< Pictures>

I did not like my experience here. I went to exchange my phone due to network problems in the first week of purchase,  all I wanted was even price and the policy would not allow to do it.  I decided to return the phone and the rep gave me a hard time and asked me unnecessary questions. I am happy that the store manager called me back later and apologized for the inconvenience, it would be nice to improve the overall customer experience and reduce the wait times for people who have reserved appointment through genius bar.</text>

Went to pick up iMac Pro on a Tuesday morning. Took a while to get it set up. The rep was very nice but needed to help others inbetween, had to leave for a meeting and a gal replaced him. She also was asked for help by another employee. So took a total of more than an hour because of interruptions. It seems they're short on staff even for a midweek morning. Weekends always have people queued in several lines at front and others sitting inside waiting for help.</text>

<Text>Multiple bad experiences with this store. Being an embedded software engineer myself, I can tell they BS a lot, at times dispensing false or useless information or advice. Imagine what it would be like for those who are not in the technology field.

I felt that the interaction with people there, if it did not lead to a purchase or repair, there would be no record. If you want to complain, there's no case number to refer to. You would just have to make general remark. Can't go back to the specific person I talked to. Hence, in many cases, there's no accountability. They just say whatever.

I replaced the iPhone 6 battery. It started to act up around 2 year. It may be true that the battery had reached end of life, and OS update did not play essential role, it's still a cost that people need to consider when purchasing a phone. Why not put a bigger battery for such premium phone? I think it's pretty universal at this point that, we don't need the phone to be any more thinner, and people want more battery, hence not only we have more battery life for daily use, the battery would also last longer.

When I signed off for the battery replacement, I did not know before hand that they said in the paper work that my phone has cosmetic damage. If I knew, I would certainly contest and ask for explaintion. This is they covering their rear end. I don't appreciate at all.

After I left my phone for battery replacement, I was told it would take 2 hours and they will email me, since they can't call me. I waited 2 and a half hours, and went back and checked, it was already done, but no email. I think for iPhone 6, it should be done for less than 30 minutes. I should have checked back earlier.

My iPhone 6 at one point showing battery stuck at 100%. I didn't know how much battery actually left and the phone could shut down any time. But when I described it people standing at the front, I was told, something to the effect that, "It's good, you never run out of battery".

One of the "Genius" there lacked the understanding of the "advices" she's giving out and didn't know what customer service is. She said my phone is low on storage that we could not do firmware upgrade. I said that's not true. The OS had been upgraded with the capability to uninstall apps in the background to free up space. I showed her that my iPad did just that.

She said a phone needed 20% or some crazy percentage of free space to operate properly. I asked her, if that's true for phones with 32GB storage and 128GB storage. It obviously doesn't make sense.

She asked me if I know what MB is. And she said the OS does not show the accurate free space left, and since I don't believe her, she asked me to add up the storage space used by all apps. Again, she asked a customer to add up the storage space used by all the apps! Is this what Apple is?

I asked if she could run some diagnostics, she declined, saying she could not.

At this point, she said she could not help me, and started the preparation for the next customer.

When I picked up my phone after the battery replacement, the same "genius" happened to be the person handing me the phone. Not sure she's not doing the genius work any more, or part of their responsibilities. Not sure if she remembered me, but she's giving out more false information, claiming the battery has 7000 charge cycles. I was just like, whatever. I thanked her, grabbed my phone and left for good.< /Text>< pictures>

They've changed and I don't like it. None of their products are labeled any more, none of them. No product descriptions or anything. Not a single price on any of them either so if you want to shop around, you can't.  You have to wait in line for one of their employees to become available just to get a price.< /text>

I did not like my experience here. I went to exchange my phone due to network problems in the first week of purchase,  all I wanted was even price and the policy would not allow to do it.  I decided to return the phone and the rep gave me a hard time and asked me unnecessary questions. I am happy that the store manager called me back later and apologized for the inconvenience, it would be nice to improve the overall customer experience and reduce the wait times for people who have reserved appointment through genius bar.< /Text>

<text>The Apple Store is the only place I've been that's managed to make buying electronics feel awkward.

I went there once because I had a gift card and wanted to buy an external hard drive for my MacBook. I knew which one I wanted, so I walked to the back of the store and picked it up. Easy.

But then it came time to pay for the thing. Most stores have a checkout area at the front where they scan your stuff and tell you the total, but not Apple Stores. At an Apple Store, you've gotta find an employee who isn't busy and get them to scan it with their iPhone.

There's no good strategy for doing this; all the employees are either already helping customers or taking to their co-workers, so you can either interrupt someone or stand around awkwardly until one of them walks up to you. For a company that prides itself on being cool, it just feels... weird.

Sure, I've had alright experiences picking up online orders and getting support, but actually buying anything is painful enough that I'd recommend going online or to a carrier store instead.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

Horrific customer service. I was standing around for 15 min waiting for help. I asked the manager how do I get help I'm interested in an ipad, she looked at me like I was an idiot. Told me to go wait in the line outside the store. I had no idea I had to wait in this line otherwise I woudln't have wasted me time. I walked in thinking I was going to buy an iPad, now I am going with a Samsung tablet.</text>

My iPhone display cracked (again, several weeks after it happened for the 1st time). I called Apple support to schedule a repair in Stonebridge mall and the rep told me that all appointments are already booked and that the 1st available one is in 5 days. She said though that I could walk in the store and see if the store can accept me as sometimes pre-scheduled appointments get canceled.
I drove to the store, waited in line for 10 minutes and then the technician signed me up for an appointment in 2 hours. I wanted to leave the phone with him and come back when it's ready to be picked up but he said that I'd need to come again in 2 hours to drop it off first and then it will take another 1.5 hours to be fixed. So overall, 3.5 hours: 2 hours to be accepted + 1.5 hours to be fixed. Couldn't the rep on the phone put me down for an appointment in 2 hours and save me a trip? Why did I have to come in person just to schedule an appointment? I had to drive 3 round trips to get the phone fixed.</review>

Not very impressed with this store. There was one time I brought in my iMac to the store after the hard disc was recalled. The service was free of course, but they damaged the back casing of my iMac. I complained and they agreed to fix it with no charge. So a week later I picked it up and found that the casing has been replaced, only to find that now the base has been damaged. It's not that bad, but I shouldn't have to settle for that. It's obvious the person fixing the computer didn't pay enough attention to small things like this. Disappointing.<//text>

<rating>1</rating><Text>Dear Apple,

I tried replacing my battery for $29 today… I wasn’t able to, not today, tomorrow, or next week. I first spent 39 minutes on the phone with your help line this morning (32 of which were on hold), and unfortunately we were not able to find an open appointment at my local Apple store (or any within 50 miles of me) this MONTH. I was instructed to check if there is a walk in appointment available. I made my way down to the Stoneridge Shopping Center and immediately realized my chances were slim to none. Nevertheless, I waited in the line to speak with an employee. I found out my options were as follows:

-Wait for 5-7 hours today to possibly qualify for a walk in appointment
-Come in earlier tomorrow to have a better shot of qualifying for that appointment
-Wait 2 weeks to schedule an appointment during work hours
-And of course, I also have the option of sending my phone in to Apple to be fixed, which costs closer to $40 with shipping and takes “about 5 business days”

According to my calculations, either way I break it down I pay more than $70 for this battery. Including this trip to the mall I would have to make at least 2 more, the mall is 20 minutes away from my house and costs at least $5 in gas roundtrip, that’s already another $15 assuming my time is free. Being that my time isn’t free, especially on Mondays when I’m at work, I figure I lose another $40+.

A piece of information I found to be truly amazing is that if by some miracle my phone found its way into the hands of an Apple employee, then first a test has to be conducted which should take 15-20 minutes, then only if there is a battery in stock I will be granted the privilege to wait for 2-3 hours for an Apple specialist to replace my battery. Once again… only if there is a battery in stock.

Fortunately, this story had a happy ending. I walked down to the phone repair booth in the mall and the 2 employees there that deal with 60+ phones daily were able to replace my battery in under 15 minutes for $45.

I would imagine that if Apple really had its customers’ best interests in mind it would invest either in training for its sales people to replace the battery (a very easy task according to Youtube) or would deploy more “Apple Specialists” to various stores.

You are in tight competition with British Petroleum for all time worst PR responses, from Foxconn to Cobalt mining, to the latest.

Goodluck,

<Text>My daughter got her battery replaced today and just noticed 5 minutes from their closing time on the same day that her screen is coming off. Sadly her original battery only lasted a year. They didn't put 2 screws in so she called before closing and they didn't answer her call.  Sucks!! Let's see what happens tomorrow when or if they answer the phone. So inconvenient :)</Text>< pictures>

Apple Genius Ryan S. you are awesome! He was multi tasking between my son, Ian and another customer (setting up an HP laptop?!). He assisted my son Ian without missing a beat, setting up iphone and linking to laptop and iPod via iCloud. This is no easy feat as my son has high functioning autism and uses a wheelchair. Ryan was extremely patient and gave Ian some useful tips on how to help organize with shared reminders between family members (so important for kiddos who need assistance with executive functioning) and strategies on how to wrangle all that music our son has acquired for the past 6 years! Thank you! My only suggestion is to set up a small table, lower in height, so that people who use wheel chairs can "dock" right up to the devices. The tables are all too high and you have to sit stand on stools. Does not work for folks who use wheelchairs. Thank you for making my son's day!<//Text>

Great Apple store, a little crowded, but the staff made every one feel important. If you have any problems with any of your Apple products I suggest Paul at the genius bar, he is great!< /review>

Not very clear thinking and products. My friend was told that graphics card of his not booting Mac pro was gone. He took second opinion and found that it is power supply issue.
You might go and come back to this store without someone even reaching you for helping you.
Return process is not smooth, they ask for receipts whereas they could have just scanned products.
Products that I tried recently showed a tremendous decay in apple standards...e.g.
Mac Mini - Tested bottom one (1.4 G) -Machine hanged without any installations. I thought it was just a bad apple but same happened on display machines too.
IPhone SE - This product is good for sub 300 range. 400+ is an overkill
iOS is no better than Android in bugs now try converting celcius to farenhite in your weather app (it takes 2-4 mins).
Camera on lock screen has controls chopped off at bottom.
Switch iCloud account on iPhone is hell complicated.
I noted 100s of bugs and will send to apple

Get well soon apple and stop being a fashion product company.</text>

The perp left their phone number for pickup notifications (I can't see full number on my end). But apparently the store didn't check ID or question the order. Then, they made it my issue to have local law enforcement track down the perp. Store rep, "Well, I can't help ya man, but it's good that you got your account recovered." Absolutely terrible.<//Text>< Pics>

This was my second experience in this store... I was helped by Maria, who was very friendly, not at all condescending, understood exactly what was needed and made it happen without problems, mistakes or confusion. She was very good at confirming my requests and communicating just what was going to happen to fulfill them. She also stuck with the issue to make sure it was resolved in a single visit, which is always much appreciated -- Bravo Maria!

My first experience, about four months ago, was far from satisfactory -- I instructed my Genius Bar rep that I wanted to have a full backup of my iPad and I brought my MacBook Air to do just that, but I was only lacking a cable. I explained multiple times that I need to have the iPad backed up before we did anything. He agreed, and then took the iPad to the back room.  He returned about 15 minutes later and said, "There, all done." I asked what he did and he said it was now wiped and reset to factory fresh. All data gone.  And of course, there was no backup.

Moral of the story: have a conversation with your Genius Bar rep for a bit before you let them loose on your device. If your rep seems too busy for this, then get a different one. After all, you are an Apple customer and this is supposed to be a premium experience. All reps aren't the same and contrary to some misinformed biases, the males are not necessarily more tech savvy than the females.</text>

Called to ask a simple question about having my iphone screen replaced  and was put on hold for over 20 minute, I hung up after getting tired of waiting and having no idea how long it would take to get someone to talk to.  It is a total insult, I will stop buying apple products.</review>

<response>None<//response><Review>Absolutely the worst customer service from any apple store ive been to. Even with an appointment you will find yourself sitting without anybody coming to help. The staff is extremely rude and especially the store manager, is a cheap unintelligent scumbag. I came in with my brand new iphone 6 that was bent... yes BENT! it was one of the few that actually was having the infamous bending issue. He refused to understand the situation that i use a case and only had the phone for a month and claimed i caused the damage. I might be a young man, but i also am a salary based college graduate intellectual, and i can tell his judgement on my character was based off stereotyping me based off my age. I was forced to contact apple customer care and was granted a brand new phone since the lady was an angel! she recommended that i go to the san francisco location or the walnut creek location. I went to the SF location, the busiest location in the country, amazing service! i was helped immediately and got my brand new phone without question... go figure the same company but different locations will determine your experience with employees.< /Review><Rating>1< /Rating><user_id>112943847058272690126</user_id>< username>

<review>I visited your Apple store at Stoneridge Mall in Pleasanton, CA this morning (10/23/2015). We were greeted by one of the representatives in front of the store and aisle. After a minute, another man (who had a headset) and possibly a manager told us to move but the manner in which he did so was offensive, rude, and unprofessional. This man was talking to another person who had a phone but did not move from there - in fact stayed with him over there. My mother and I were at the store and perhaps he did not see us as customers to be treated with courtesy and care. I am very dissatisfied with this person's behavior and would ask Apple management to address his lack of tact and customer service.<//review>< pictures>

<Text>Just wanted to say that I got great service at this Apple Store last night.  It's iPhone 6 launch time right now and the store is a little crazy, but a couple of the trainers Rob and Myk (sp?) were working really hard to try and take care of everybody with issues at the Genius Bar.  I walked in (couldn't get an appt online) and knew I might not be able to get seen, but they worked me in anyway.

I had a screen repair issue that I'd been told by Apple Customer Care could be repaired either in-store ($109) or by sending into Apple ($299 plus 3-5 business days).  WC Apple said they don't have the machine to do the repair onsite and I'd just have to call around (they didn't know which stores had one, and neither did Apple's national call-line....).   Apple at Stoneridge said they couldn't do the repair onsite, but offered to exchange my phone at the in-store repair price (the phone was only 3 days old, I'm not sure they'd offer this to everyone).  Anyway, the upshot is I felt like they really bent over backward in several ways to help me out when I just got roadblocks at other avenues.

I know there have been some middling reviews in the past for this location, but if last night was any indicator, the management is working to right any past missteps.  Even more impressive that they were able to do so under such stressful circumstances as a major new product launch.  Kudos, guys!< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

One of the worst Apple store in the bay area. Went to the store today for an Apple watch. A lady working there was not interested in talking to us or giving any information.  She  was rude and condescending. What happened to customer service at this place? Store manger please hire people who  want to work at Apple store not that you have to fill a seat.</Review>
