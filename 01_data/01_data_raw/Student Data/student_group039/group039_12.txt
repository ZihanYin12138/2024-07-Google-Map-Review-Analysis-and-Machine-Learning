<Text>Dr. Tasto and his staff are fantastic! I have been going to Dr. Tasto with my wife and 2 children for over 20 years. Dr. Tasto is an excellent dentist, uses state of the art tech, and he is the leader of the fun atmosphere in his office. Dr. Tasto is also an award winning dentist among his professional peers. Dr. Kim is also a brilliant dentist and oral surgeon. The entire staff is wonderful! Highly recommended.<//Text>< pictures>

< Review>
Monica has always done a great job cleaning my teeth.

She is always suggesting different ways to improve my dental health.  I finally took het advice and bought an Oral B toothbrush.  My teeth have never been whiter and my gums no longer bleed.

Thanks, Monica.</Review>

< Review>
The dental services provided by Dr. Tasto's office were once again outstanding.  Monica did her superb magic cleaning  once again and has kept my teeth out of gum disease jail.  Dr Tasto gave it his personal touch in performing the exam.< /Review>

Dr. Tasto and his team of technicians and staff are top notch. They have always made my experience of visiting the dentist enjoyable. During my regular maintenance visits for teeth cleaning and x-rays, I am guaranteed to be treated professionally while enjoying a positive atmosphere. I have been told more than once during my teeth cleanings that Dr. Tasto has created a work environment that his staff are happy and proud to be a part of.

Nobody likes to have to pay for additional dental work, and the professionals at Dr.Tasto's understand this. Recommendations for unexpected procedures are always supported with photos and procedural options and  while the  patients dental health is the priority, their budgetary concerns are met with understanding and a team who help you navigate your insurance and out of pocket costs if required.< /review>

<review>I actually look forward to my visit to the dentist. My whole family has used Dr. Tasto and his team for over 20 years. They are always professional and do a great job. I am a nurse and my husband is a doctor so When I tell you they took COVID seriously and put in all the mitigation procedures in place possible, I know what I am talking about. They are a great team, friendly, professional and of course Dr. Tasto went to USC so Fight On.< /review>< Pictures>

Dr Tasto was a part time dentist at this location for a long time while Dr Johnson owned the practice. Dr Johnson was a great dentist that I had seen for 30 years....Dr Tasto is just as great. He’s already remodeled the office, which looks more inviting. Even though the top notch staff has been there for years the vibe seems better than ever! Monica and Annie are very good dental hygienists, Jazzy, Sara and Kassandra are not only efficient but quick to smile, making an otherwise arduous, obligatory  dental visit more than tolerable!< /review>

It's still worth the drive because of the professionalism, friendly atmosphere and the overall  great communication they offer. I tell everyone how great my dental group is. It's hard to find great service anywhere any more but you guys are stand outs and could teach other companies what good customer service is all about. Keep doing an outstanding job.</Text>< Pics>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>I had my teeth cleaned today by Annie and it was a great experience! Everyone was very friendly and welcoming. I haven't had my teeth cleaned in a year and before that it had been 5+ years. Sometimes when you haven't been as good as you should about flossing or brushing all the right spots you might feel guilty or stressed, so it was great the hygienist, Annie, didn't make me feel like that at all. She was really positive and upbeat. She was encouraging about how I can improve my gum health, which makes me feel good about keeping up so my next appointment will be easier!
Thank you everyone. I appreciate Gladis and Jasmine helping me schedule an appointment and being so friendly and sweet.< /text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

I am very grateful for the excellent care and customer service provided by Dr Tasto and Jazmin during my initial visit/dental emergency (in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic). Dr Tasto and Jazmin were very kind, welcoming, and helpful, and set up an urgent oral surgery consult on the spot. Despite the pain, it was such a surprisingly pleasant experience. I highly recommend Dr Tasto and Scripps West Dental!<//Review>

Dr. Tasto did skilled and efficient work on a rather complicated procedure
for me. I was skeptical, but he explained in detail what was going to happen before we started and that relieved some of my anxiety. When I experienced how accurate and masterful his hands and instruments were used, i was relieved and very thankful.
The receptionists are always joyful ,thoughtful, and courteous. The dental assistants are gentle and encouraging and the dental hygienists educate me well, My gums and overall dental health, are improving significantly ,even in my senior years. I give the team an A plus!<//Review>

Since going to Scripps West I feel I’ve gotten the care necessary to entend the life of my natural teeth despite poor care from my younger years. The many cavities from my teenage years put my teeth at risk. Scripts has been creative at knowing best practices to help me recover from that damage. In addition to having a great staff of people making dental care easier to embrace.<//Review>

First impression entering, most awesome front office staff, Jasmin & Gladys who promoted a positive, calm lovely vibe!!! Atmosphere was calming, ZEN, felt instantly thrilled to be establishing here, hopefully my forever dental office for hubby and I. Xrays by Kassandra were effortless, gentle and efficient and she was a lovely addition to the the consultation process, and the most amazing meet with Dr. Tasto sealed the appointment for me, he was the most caring, comprehensive and informative dentist I have ever had. Highly advanced knowledge in all area of dental and implant issues, listens to concerns and educates patient with queries, a truly top notch dentist to whom I will trust All my dental issues with in the coming months into years.  I felt an immediate trust, and felt Dr. Tasto heard all my concerns, understands medical issues I have,  and has the highest knowledge to address this to ensure my experience in his office will be of the highest quality!!! Best experience ever!!!<//Text>

Everybody at Scripps West Dental is the best.  I've been a patient for maybe over 10+ years and I always feel like family every time I visit.  Dr. Tasto is my dentist and he is very friendly. He thoroughly explains what's going on with my teeth.  When he sees potential issue, he explains what should be done, but not forcing me to make the decision on the spot, rather he keeps an eye on it and he informs me with the condition everytime I visit. Monica is my hygienist. She is really good at what she does.  She listens to my concerns and she addresses them if she can, or she provides advice what I should do to prevent it get worst. She then explains it to Dr. Tasto so he can evaluate it.  She is the one who inspired me to floss my teeth every day, which really helped to keep my teeth healthy.  The staffs in front office are friendlier as ever.  I highly recommend this dental clinic..</Text>

I have been going to Modvellum for some time and I have to say that I am in love with this place. The facials are amazing. So relaxing and my skin always looks great. The price is right. Olga is awesome. She is an expert and so nice to work with. I have had waxes done by her and she is fast and surprisingly, it really does not hurt. Modvellum uses fantastic products that are organic and smell amazing. I highly recommend Modvellum.< /Text>

I came here for a facial about 6 months ago, they have a very good first time client deal. The location is in the marina right on union street so parking is hard - definitely take public transit. The facilities are warm and inviting. Throughout my facial the woman who was performing it walked me though every procedure which was nice and reassuring. I would recommend this place to anybody for a nice, quick service.<//Review>

I love that they have so many facials to choose from! It is very well located in the Marina area. The Estheticians are friendly and knowledgeable. I've never had any problems booking an appointment, so that's extra points. They are very punctual and professional on the work they do. Also they have a lot of deals to take advantage from. Highly recommend!< /Review>

A little tricky to find but once you get upstairs the ladies are all very nice.  It's a quaint and quiet little boutique of a salon with a lot of privacy.  Temperature can get pretty cold in the wax rooms and the facials were painless but don't expect any frills or spa like amenities.</text>

It's very cute small place in a nice neighborhood. I do feel like my skin was glowing for like a day or two after the facial. However, I feel that the girls sometimes could try to push sales. Generally, a good place to come for relaxation< /review>

Unlike a lot of places I visited before this via Living Social, the peels are strong and effective, and when you purchase a series of certain peels, you get skin care to use between treatments to maximize results.  Also a very convenient location for anyone in Pac Heights, Nob Hill, or Russian Hill. Not sure why anyone would say it isn't well-kept- it looks great every time I'm there.<//text><Name>Julia Luster< /Name><Pictures>None<//Pictures></record>

<Review>I had my first facial ever at Modvellum. They were very professional and made me feel comfortable by explaining the process and what results to expect. I chose a basic facial. My face felt smooth and refreshed for days after. I'd definitely return to Modvellum.< /Review>< Time>

I had a facial here a few times with Darya. She is amazing. Every since time she did a great job, leaving my skin super clean and refreshed. The salon itself is also great. I love the location, and it is very homey and welcoming inside. I will definitely come back for such amaizing service.<//Review>

I came here for a facial and overall I had a very good experience. The staff was very friendly and helpful, the spa was in a nice location and the lady that did my facial was comfortable to be around. The spa is inviting and relaxing, and I was impressed with the results. I would get a facial here again.<//Review>

I got a gift visit for my Wife and Daughter. It was a very simple and easy experience to purchase the gift and they had no problem using it. It was one of the best gifts I every bought them and would recommend other to do the same, especially those in need of a quick but personalized gift.< /text>

This is by far the best place I've had a facial.  My skin is ultra sensitive and the products used are so pure that I keep going back and swear by Cosmedix, as the results are pretty great.  The facials are so soothing and relaxing, that at times I doze off.  Easy to get to, parking is easy, and they run on time.  Love it.</Text>

i have been to Modvellum several times, and I'd say I've always left with satisfying results. I have done the standard facial, the moisturizing facial and the enzyme peel. They are professional and make you feel at home. Not to mention that they have occasional $39 facials!<//text>

<review>Went here religiously every other month leading up to my wedding for facials and couldn't have been happier! The staff always made sure to listen to me and customize my treatment for my changing skin (definitely try out the "marine layer" mask!) and now use their recommended products exclusively. A great no-hassle spa that's constantly offering deals as well. What more could you ask for?</review>< rating>

I have had two facials now with Olga, and my skin was so happy afterwards. She also gave me some great advice about how to care for it in between facials. Mod Vellum is a very nice place with a low-key, relaxing atmosphere. The only drawback is trying to park near there!< /text>

I hadn't had a facial in years but a friend told me about this great place on Union St. So I booked an appointment for a Human Extractor facial. It was a great experience. I walked in to what looked like an apartment turned spa. It was clean and simple. The facial was great, but a bit painful. Let's just say she got everything out! It was what I hoped for. I broke out a bit the following week (research showed me that was normal, esp since it had been so long since I had one). The week after that my skin was clear and glowing. I definitely recommend this place. I may try a peel the next time. If it's been a while since you've had a facial, don't do it right before a big event, in case you break out like I did.< /review>

I've been to Modvellum a few times now and have always been pleasantly happy with the facials I've received here. The Estheticians are friendly, accommodating, and listen to my skin concerns. The online booking system makes it easy to schedule a facial and the treatment rooms are clean and spacious. They often run promotions so the price ain't so bad either. Would definitely recommend trying the Electric Youth Facial.<//review>

Modvellum offers a great service and often promotional offers. I scheduled an appointment for facial cleaning in the past, but had to cancel it, the girl over the phone was super friendly and reschedule it for me with no issues. Modvellum website is quite cute and easy to use. I definitely will recommend Modvellum to my friends.</Review>

<text>Modvellum is a decent place to have your facials done. I bought a living social deal and tried it out for the first time and liked them. I then proceeded for a second facial a month later since they were offering a 50% off deal, the esthetician was really nice and made me feel relaxed and comfortable. I would most likely be back as long as they offer deals since some of their prices are a little overpriced.< /text><UserId.>113425058124803800549</UserId.><Time>1383845699280< /Time><response>None<//response><pictures>None< /pictures><name>Wendy Du<//name>< GmapID>

The spa is in a quaint building on union st. very cozy and clean. After the facial my skin felt as soft as baby's skin. I will definitely return here for more facials in the future. One of the great things about Mod Vellum, is that they always have great deals running. They also use top of the line products.<//text>< pictures>

I came here for a vespa facial. It was the first time ever for me to get a facial, so I didn't know what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised. The staff was great, and the girl doing my facial really made me feel comfortable and relaxed.My skin felt super clean after, I didn't even think a facial would do such good for my skin. I will definitely come here again.< /review>

<Text>Clean, relaxing environment.  The people were all very nice and welcoming.  Overall was a great experience, even including extractions.  I went because a friend of mine and I had groupons, and feel that it was worth the money, but would be expensive otherwise for me.  Also, just a warning for those who don't live within easy public transit, the parking situation was not trivial, so leave a little extra time for that.< /Text>< userid>

I hate leaving bad reviews, but there are so many glowing ones for Modvellum, I felt people needed a balance perspective.

I get facials regularly.  I was on a quest to find the place for me after a move.  This place was not it. The facial room was cold and there was no sink in the facial room.  It is not hygienic to have someone handling skin be unable to wash their hands after extractions.

The facial itself was very superficial.  There were very few extractions.  The girl went light on the products and barely did a massage.  I was left under the mask for a very long time, not because it needed to be on that long to be effective, but because it allowed the esthetician to be out of the room.

I know I got this facial on a deal, but I think of offers from merchants as a acquisition cost per new client: they give me a deal on a great service to get me in the door and then make back the money they lost on the deal by gaining a regular customer.

In this case, their quality of the service I had was terrible and I would never pay full price or even the discounted price for a repeat.  Modvellum will never make a regular customer out of me.<//text>

I've had a few facials at Modvellum and really enjoyed each one. I am a very last minute person so each facial has been with a different esthetician but that wasn't a problem because they were all great! I am actually planning on scheduling an appointment to go back the first week of December... can't wait!< /Review>

Great facial, did a very clinical job which was what I needed not just a basic cleaning.  Would go back.  Purchased the products that were recommended and they seem good.  As I'm close to 50 there are no miracles so a good cleaning and peel helpful.  The space is welcoming, private and the owner does most of the facials and is very knowledgable.  Regular prices are on the high side but see if you can get it at a special rate.  At least for your first time.< /Text>

This place was great... but now I'd say it's just good. The service was good, but they do pressure you to purchase products very strongly. That's my least favorite part of the experience. I do like the napa peel - feels like broken glass on your face, but is so good!<//Review>

I got a deal to visit Modvellum and I was not at all disappointed.  The staff was prompt and professional, and overall I had a good experience.  I would definitely go back.  The only disadvantage was they had this strange entry process into the building, so when I got there I couldn't get in (I think someone has to buzz you in and no one was there), but on the flip side, at least you know they take security seriously.<//review>

I went there for a facial. The atmosphere is really nice. The staff was friendly and professional. When the person giving me facial accidentally got a little face wash in my eye, which just stung a little bit, he was really nice about it and gave me a free collagen mask. I would definitely recommend them for facials.< /Text>

I've had 4+ facials done here and always a  good experience, with different people each time. The first time I was with Jackie. I have very dry skin, and after analyzing my skin she recommended this cream for me to use daily. I've tried countless different creams, but this is the only one that makes a big difference on my skin. I am forever grateful!

Also, Modvellum runs promotions very frequently where you can pre-pay for discounted facials and waxing. They are a very good deal!< /text>

Nice, relaxing place to get a facial! Location is a little confusing, but the staff here is approachable and very knowledgeable about skin care.  Prices are typical for SF, but quite the pretty penny for my pocket. If I need a facial in SF, this is my place to go!< /Text>

Bought a Groupon for Modvellum and it was totally worth it. The facility was clean and crisp with a San Francisco home feel to it. My esthetician did a great job with my facial and was a super cute and friendly guy. I felt very taken care of and felt my skin was in good hands. I left with glowing skin (No Joke - my friend even commented) and had create skin after. I'd definitely go back.< /text>

< Review>
I am not a person who thrives on facials, but going to ModVellum is a treat I never knew I wanted.  The pampering quotient is quite high, and all of the employees are wonderfully gifted at what they do.  Plus they offer *steep* discounts from time to time that make it even possible for me to consider going.  My wish list is short: 1) I wish it were easier to book appointments; the website isn't user friendly and takes a long time to pick a date and procedure.  2) Not being a SF resident, I wish there was more guidance on parking; best times to go?  discounted parking?</Review>

<Review>I have been getting waxed here for over a year. I like the online scheduling system and the various discounts that are offered through services like Amazon Local & Groupon. The staff is nice and friendly and always makes you feel very comfortable. Alla is super fast so I always try to book with her. Modevellum is in the heart of the Marina/Cow Hollow neighborhoods so you can conveniently grab a meal, coffee or do some shopping when you come by. I would definitely recommend!<//Review>< Pics>

Modvellum is clean and quite with very friendly staff. I have been there twice for facials, and would really love to love it, but I broke out following both facials. I do not have problem skin, and rarely every get pimples so I am pretty sure it was their extraction technique. All in all, I do not think I will go back.<//Text>

I have always had a great experience at Modvellum. The aestheticians are helpful, knowledgeable, and great listeners. Sometimes you walk in and just want to relax for the next hour and half after a long day and sometimes you just want to talk for an hour and a half straight. Either way Modvellum is adaptable and gives you what you want- holistically.  Thanks, MV. Looking forward to the next time!</text>

<rating>4< /rating><Text>I have to be honest and say that it's been a few years since I last visited Modvellum, but from what I remember, they were very professional, courteous, and thorough in performing the facial on me. My skin felt really clean and glowing, and I was even convinced to purchase some of their products (and trust me - I'm a hard sell!).

They are a little pricey (but then again, any good facial place will be), but they always have good specials and do the occasional living social or groupon deal, which is the reason I tried them out in the first place.

It's a great value if you do get a deal for them through one of those groupon type websites.</Text>< pics>

<text>This review is from my visit last year. Honestly I was not crazy about this place and the skin care products they use were o-k to me and I never came back for another facial. I believe I got the vespa treatment since I had a voucher from living social. It didn't really wowed me, or saw any big difference with my skin, it just felt like my skin was clean for the whole day, and that was it. It says on the description of the treatment that it should leave my skin radiant or something for days but I really didn't feel that way.</text>< Pics>

<gmapID>0x808580c2ce0c2ead:0xbcb6e335956e0009<//gmapID><text>1st time I visited Modvellum (with a deal), I saw Daria and I loved my experience. We did a facial the first time and then on my next couple of times, we did a light peel in addition to my facial to help with scars. She was super friendly and she made me feel comfortable talking about product. The first time I purchased a "100% Pure" face wash that I really enjoyed, and the 2nd time or 3rd time, I purchased a "Cosmedix" Serum to help with cell turnover. It really worked!

My next time to Modvellum, I saw Olga. Olga strongly suggested an intense peel instead of my facial. She made me feel like I was making the wrong decision by sticking with the facial instead of the peel. I was worried about peeling at work during the following  days from a more intense peel. Even if I was wrong to not do the peel instead of the facial, I don't feel like clients should feel uncomfortable at any time during their service for any reason. In light of that, I feel confident in my decision as I am a licensed cosmetologist. Unfortunately, a day or so after my facial my nose was SO sore from the extractions. It felt like I had been punched in the nose. I'm not kidding! I am not one to go out of my way to write non-positive reviews, but this is just what happened. So, unfortunately after that experience, I haven't returned...

Despite my last experience, Modvellum is a clean, nice space, and I do love the products they carry!< /text><user_name>Gina Riggs</user_name>< pics>

Modvellum is a decent place for facials. I bought an online deal. The appt system online was nice and straightforward, and the place is located in a easy-to-access area. The esthetician was really nice, but they did like to try to push their products and extra services. I'd say they were not too pushy about it though, which was nice. Prices are a bit overpriced so I'd say it's much more worth it if you wait for a deal to come around.< /Review>

Came here a few weeks ago for a brazilian wax because of a Groupon. Had a good first time experience here. The place was clean and cutely decorated. For the price it wasn't bad but I probably wouldn't be back for full price. Nothing special stood out to me about this place.< /text>

My skin felt really good both immediately after the facial and continued to improve in tone in days afterwards. I would recommend this place without hesitation.

<review>I got a deal on living social. I made an appointment, but due to parking issues, I never made it to my appointment. But the guys at ModVellum were just awesome about it. One of them even came out to the street to help me find parking, but unfortunately, we were just unlucky that night. And for that alone, next time I find another great deal on living social or one of those sites, I will definitely buy it. And plan for better ways of getting there. See you soon!<//review>< username>

<review>I've been here a handful of times for the Vespa facial. Everyone that did my facials was always professional and friendly. I liked that I was out in an hour or less. Good place to go for someone on the go as they are prompt. The only annoying aspect of this business if that when you call them no one picks up. You have to leave a message and wait for a call back, not always the most convenient option. I will definitely be coming back!</review></record>

<Time>1385004900345< /Time><rate>2</rate><Text>I have been to Modvellum once and the service during the facial was alright. However, the booking, appointment, cancellation process is very difficult to deal with. I recently bought a promotion that was not marketed as new customers only and was later brought to my attention that I could not use what I had bought even though I had not been in over a year. I tried to call, email, l left messages no one ever contacted me. This is not how I would try to acquire and retain customers. I tried to book an appointment for a friend and then later tried to cancel it and the online system would not allow me to do so. Again I had to call and email multiple times. The customer service and communication has a lot to be desired.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Rachel is honest about what works or not. She does not fake to make you buy stuff. I was struggling with red face, bumps and dry skin. She told me what to do at home, addition to her magic at Spa.
My skin is a lot smoother and less red, much better complex than before I visited.
She has new customer promotion, try it and you will be back for more.

It's been a while since I've been here but I remember when I left, my face felt refreshed, moisturize and nourished! The "pimple white head squeezing was a tad painful but very necessary. They do try to sell you products afterwards and to me were quite pricy and weren't a match for my skin. But overall, good experience.</Review>

I went here a couple of weeks ago with my mom. We were offered beverages upon arrival which was really nice. Then we got lead into separate rooms. I think my specialist was Alla. She wasn't particularly the warmest esthetician I've been to but she did a great job on my facial. She got all of my blackheads painlessly and effectively. There was no scaring after or much redness and minimal down time after the facial. It was especially worth it because we used a great groupon deal.
Did not feel too pressured to buy the cosmetic line they offered after.
Not a super relaxing spa atmosphere but the results are what count and they definitely provide that!</review>

<Name>Katty Tseng<//Name><review>I had two facials done here and both experience were awesome.
The staff were very friendly, and they explained to me what they were doing on my face each time. Also they tailored facials well to my skin (i had a lot of blackheads but surprisingly they were all gone at the end of my session!!  - ive had many many facials done in other places and no other places had done this job so well).

I gave this place a four star cuz the rooms were kinda cold and also I had a no-show at one of my appointments (apparently the staff called me and left a message, but I wasn't aware of it). Also I felt a little pressured to buy their products. Otherwise the experience was great.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I purchased a groupon to Mod vellum and received a very nice facial.  The women there seem knowledgable and helpful. I felt great afterwards and it was very clean and comfortable.  The only nuisance is that they don't answer the phone when you call, responding only to emails and the front door is always locked so you need to get a special code when you come.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

For a long time I've been looking for an aesthetician who is really good at chemical face peels and facials. My first time at Modvellum was just amazing. The staff was welcoming, and very warm & pleasant. The building was home-like and clean. I got an aesthetician named Luciana. She was very attentive and although I was not there long it didn't feel like a rushed process. She made me feel comfortable right away, I loved the fact that she got to the point about things and  how very knowledgeable about the products they sell at Modvellum & also a wide veriety of other brands. I also enjoyed the comfort of conversation and how not once did I feel pressured to buy anything. I highly recommend Luciana. I cant wait to return for another perfect experience.
Thank You, Modvellum.<//Text>

It was my first time so I was not sure what to expect. I booked with one facialist but was seen by another. I had the introductory Vespa facial. I enjoyed the experience and the facialist was quite nice. However, I expected the facial to be more specifically tailored to my skin needs.< /Review>

They are very transparent, from their website telling you all the prices to the esthetician explaining every step. They were a tad pushy, but it's their job - especially if you're using a groupon.<//review>< pics>

<review>Fail!

I bought the TravelZoo deal: 45 dollars for 150 dollars.

The entire experience was below expectations, although I still tipped 10 dollars. I did not think I got facial massage at all. The person was new to the job who did not explain the entire process. No explanations about the pros and cons. Nothing was mentioned about what to avoid after peel.

It's a fail for me. I will never want to go back. Plus, do not use Travelzoo which is a scam. They will not refund you if you decided to change your mind.

Avoid the place! They even charge a $15 cancellation fee. When the flu strikes, it does not give one 24 hour notice.</review>< Pictures>

<text>How's this place still in business? Other reviewers mentioned this it was filthy, but I didn't want to believe. The place is very dirty! Also  appointment system is not user friendly. It's extremely hard to find a time slot! and book! an appointment. Times are very limited . During the facial, lady kept talking about packages and products "I need"- that's not very relaxing and a bit upsetting. Overall their customer service is horrible IMO. I def not gonna be back.</text>< Pictures>

The place was clean and the people were nice.  I lucked out on parking, but it can be a challenge.  I was using a deal (can't remember which one), so the price was right.  I was just a little nervous about my first facial here, and I wasn't exactly put at ease by the esthetician, but that was probably not totally her fault.  She was friendly, but I felt a bit like I was getting a tsk tsk for not wearing tons of product all of the time.  Overall, I would give it 3.5 stars, rounding up to 4.  :)</text>

I had a brazilian wax done and it was ok. The gal missed a lot of little hairs that I had to pluck myself when I got home. The pain level was tolerable compared to others. She was very nice and the place is cute and clean and comfortable. This was my first time here because I got a coupon but they had lots of problems with the appointments. They had to reschedule many times before I could get in. The girl was nice to let me use my coupon again. I may come back for something else but probably not a brazilian.</Review>

I was unimpressed. Went in for a facial that I bought from a Groupon thinking that it would be a nice way to relax. My appointment started about 15-20 minutes late so I sat and waited for a while since I showed up 10 minutes early to be sure I got the full time. The woman who gave my facial was very judgmental of my skin! When she asked what I used and I responded with "Olay," she quickly said "Is that due to budget?" in an unfriendly tone. When I confessed that I wasn't good at sticking to my regimen, she said "yeah, I can tell." I was shocked! I mean, my skin isn't perfect but it's FAR from bad! Not a way to make someone feel comfortable, regardless. She also left the back door wide open so there were flies buzzing around my head at times...ugh. After the fact, my skin is not the way it normally feels after a facial. In fact, it seems unusually dry and flakey. Not a fan of the experience, I would not return even with another discount.<//Text>

I went in for a signature facial that I purchased through LivingSocial. My esthetician was running late but my appointment was really great. She was very sweet and made lots of product suggestions without trying to hard to have me buy them then and there. My face felt smooth and had a nice glowiness to it the next day. Its a nice place to treat yourself but you'd need something more intensive for more dramatic results. Overall, I was satisfied and the LivingSocial made it a great deal!</Review>

<rate>5< /rate><Text>I've been to Modvellum MANY times - which says a lot all on it's own. I have most often seen Oksana, who is WONDERFUL! She builds a personal relationship with you and your skin. Every facial I've had done with her has been really lovely, and highly effective. My favorite is the 1/2 and 1/2, where you get a facial and a (gentle) peel.
They carry good products, and don't really push them at you. I discovered a particular line of products there thanks to Oksana, and now I use those products every day.

The only con? There's no receptionist, the lovely aestheticians do everything and sometimes the online booking program can be a little persnickity.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

< Review>
I have gone to this place for facial and microdermabrasion which clears up a lot of acne and scars. I definitely recommend this place. I am going back again soon for facial and airbrush.<//Review>

<review>I learned about Modvellum through a LivingSocial sale.  As some other reviews mentioned, it's definitely a cute boutique location with lots of great products on sale as well.  Be sure to bring cash for tip, especially if you are using a flash sale coupon (Groupon, LivingSocial, etc).

Modvellum employees do a great job of making you feel comfortable and relaxed.  I look forward to my next visit!<//review>< user>

<review>I had a pretty good experience at Modvellum.  Getting there, the wait time, facial & actual visit was good!  The process of booking an appt., trying to get in w/a friend & not being able to reach ANYONE by phone was really annoying.  My friend actually gave up her online deal due to the hassle.  I live on the peninsula & to buy a voucher & then have a hard time booking w/a friend for 2 facials way in advance deterred her from using this spa again.  As for me, I thought I'd give them another chance.  They offered another amazing $29 deal & I thought, "Why not?"  Well, that's b/c I wasn't even able to book an appt. on-line this time.  That's the only way to make an appt.  I finally reached them & they offered me a free facial which I've yet to use.  I also was able to get a refund after much back & forth w/Living Social.  In the end, it might be best to invest in hiring a receptionist or at least someone who will answer emails & ph. calls.  Really makes a difference as that is the the first impression of "face" of your business other than your website!  Thanks...<//review></record></dataset><record>

Firstly, groupon made the mistake of letting people buy more then one without being explicit that only one could be used on yourself.. so of course I bought more then one.

I realized they had a $50 facial for first timers so I decided to do that before using my groupons. The first person I had was Olga. She was friendly and professional the first time around. Very informative. The second appointment I of course scheduled with her as well since I had such a good first experience. At the end of the session when I'm paying and she realizes I have a groupon, she gives me such a hard time telling me how she could even make her rent when I'm using my groupons and how I was only suppose to buy one. I did not like that and did not feel like it was necessary. SO I emailed groupon and they were able to refund me for all except one.

I chose to go with someone else this time around: Ever. He was soooo good. I realized last minute that I had scheduled a peel instead of a facial so he was able to accommodate me (I don't like peels) and was so relaxed about it. He really simply just enjoys giving facials and gave me some helpful suggestions. If you're going, definitely schedule with Ever!! This review would've been 2 stars had it not been for him.<//text>

This place a have great food with very cheap prices.  A $1.50 per taco, you can't go wrong.  Although I didn't try a lot of stuff on the menu, I believe they all will be just as good. The staff are friendly, and the service is fast. They only accept CASH.< /Review>

I love this place, they now accept card with a 50 cent per transaction.  I always grab the tripas quesadilla here and it is to die for every time. Everything is cooked clean and fresh I don't notice much Grease at all but lots of flavor.<//Text>

When I took a bite of the asada and pastor tacos, I was like WOW. Great quality meat and tortilla.
Tender amazing and tasty.

Nothing fancy just honest interpretation of homemade Mexican food. Recipes and results will always be somewhat different, but not by much, due to the fact that it's a little hole in the wall spot. Service is nice and the food is good for the price. If you don't feel like making Mexican and you have cash, come down to Karina and give the potatoes tacos a shot!< /Text>

We always get about 10 tacos 3 carne asada 3 chicken and 2 chorizo.  They serve a generous portion of jalapeno peppers and radishes and limes and the salsa is very good. Very comfortable dining area inside and out.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x80c2daa18ff478bf:0x815744dd21929d0e<//Gmap_id></record>

<text>My wife, daughter and I tried this place for the first time today and enjoyed it. The menu offers a good variety of dishes including; Tacos, Burritos (dry and wet), Tortas, Sopes, Flautas, Nachos, Enchiladas, Menudo (Sat. & Sun. Only), Chiliquelas and more. My Daughter ordered the Nachos and was dissapointed that they were made with shredded cheese instead of traditional nacho cheese. They were also topped with sour cream and guacamole, and were pretty tasty overall. We ended up ordering our daughter a chicken sope to offset her disappointment, which she really liked. My wife orderd a Torta Cubana, which she enjoyed for the most part but was kinda thrown off by the addition of hot dog wiener. I ordered tacos con papas, which was served with rice and beans; I had no complaints. The prices are reasonable, ranging from 5 to 9 dollars depending on the dish. I Give Karina's Tacos a 4 out of five. It isn't the best Taco joint I have visited, but this place got the job done.<//text><date>1537678352859<//date>< rate>

< review>
(Translated by Google) One of the old Mexican restaurants in the San Gabriel area, Taco is its signature dish and there are some other signature fast foods. Try to try Mexican snacks like Taco. You can't miss it. This is one of the restaurants that local police officers especially love. The restaurant that the police officer is willing to go to is a certain restaurant! !

(Original)
聖蓋博地區老牌墨西哥菜餐廳之一 ， Taco餅是其招牌菜 還有一些其他招牌快餐 想嘗試墨西哥的快餐式的小吃Taco餅 你不可錯過 這也是當地警員特別愛的餐廳之一 只要是有警員願意去的餐廳 那是一定可以的餐廳噢！！</review>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) If you like the onion welcome to the right place, here they serve you extra onion in the food you order. I did not like it at all, the burnt bread, extra onion, the unflavored soda, the hard meat Definitely bad experience, I do not recommend it.

(Original)
Si te gusta la cebolla bienvenid@ al lugar correcto, aquí te sirven extra cebolla en la comida que pidas. A mi no me gustó para nada, el pan quemado, extra cebolla, la soda sin sabor, la carne dura Definitivamente mala experiencia, no lo recomiendo.<//Review>

Cuban cakes are very good.
The one who is almost never good is the one that dispatches 😈

I had made an appointment for a later date because I had been fitted for a mouth guard at a previous appointment. The guard came in early so Western Dental called asking if I wanted to come in earlier and made an appointment for the same day. I’m pleased with the fit of the guard and the teeth cleaning was thorough. The office staff handled my insurance. Friendly and efficient service rating 5 stars!</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<text>I was scared to go in at all!
When I arrived the front staff was amazing!
Lamika was the best. She really helped me go through the process and understand what I needed to do. I really felt comfortable with her. She rocks!
The staff in the back, amazing! Very kind, patient souls. Edgar.... thank you for being you.
I. Cant remember all your names but thank you all so much for changing my Dental experience. I am no longer scared.

Thank you,

This office is horrible.  We had a dental emergency. They made us wait an hour passed our appointment and then proceeded to put a band aid on the infected tooth. After a couple months and us going to our regular dentist. We were told they put filling over an infected tooth and did a messy job. Never go to this Santa Cruz office. I honestly don't think anyone went to actually school.</text>

<text>Terrible experience. This company’s policy is that every time you go in you must get X-rays done, even if you recently had them done at the same office. Without the X-ray they refuse to service you at all. I for a fact know that adults with healthy teeth and gums ARE NOT supposed to get X-rays that often. There should be an ability for patients to opt out of X-rays and still receive service. PLUS once the X-rays are done they make you schedule another appotunent for the cleaning (because the X-rays took up all of the appointment time.) This is completely unacceptable and a dirty ploy for Western dental to make more money off of its patients. I will NOT be returning here.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

<Date>1605340474961</Date><review>I had gotten braces from the office in San Fernando to be transferred here in Santa Cruz after my move. The San Fernando Office assured me I would be able to be seen at any western dental for my braces. It took MONTHS to finally be seen by this office because they kept saying they were not receiving any new applicants. I had to pay an additional $1000 fee for them to see me because they claim that every office is their own separate unit so the amount I paid for my braces in the San Fernando Office would not go towards their office in Santa Cruz. In the end, I had to pay an additional $1000 fee for them to accept me and see me in their office. Completely ridiculous. My teeth are now worse than before since I had been left with months of not being seen for adjustments.< /review>< response>

<review>My daughter left the dentist office much upset!  She was told that unless she came up with $537 for some much needed bone transplant, by December her back tooth will have splintered causing blood poisoning throughout her system.  What kind of reassuring care is that?  No solution given as to finding possible funding assistance!<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x808e403b4726b227:0x3bc13582303b3501< /Gmap_id></record>

In addition the western dentals aren't "connected" so even though I got an x-ray at one they made me get another at this location because they couldn't access the one from the week earlier.</review>< pictures>

Other low star reviews for this dental office are well-deserved due to unprofessional office staff and office policies that endanger patients.

You will be forced to sign a binding arbitration agreement, essentially waving your legal rights to recourse, before receiving treatment.

The dental visit and cleaning are performed at separate visits which is a waste of patients' time. This also means that patients need to risk exposure to SARS-CoV-2 (novel coronavirus) on two separate visits.

Office staff, including the office manager, refuse to provide a blank release of records form to complete outside of their office. Instead, they insist that this form be picked up in-person from their office. This is not only inconvenient, but creates unnecessary risk for patients in the midst of a pandemic.< /text>

< Review>
Absolutely the worst dental experience I have ever had. Booked an appointment and after waiting 45 minutes and being told the dentist was behind and it would be another half hour I opted for another appointment time. After showing up to the next appointment I was told the dentist was running behind and they could only do half the appointment and would have to reschedule for a third appointment. Absolutely ridiculous. Save yourself the time and find a reputable dentist. These guys are jokes. Will never go back!!<//Review>

<Text>I called to western dental for an appointment this afternoon, and was told that I am experiencing a dental emergency based on my symptoms, and to get there right away. I rushed over to be turned away, they said I didn’t have an appointment, and there is no such thing as a dental emergency appointment, and if I thought it was a real emergency to go to the emergency room. I am in an unbelievable amount of pain and I was turned away, even though I had made an appointment for this office visit. I’m blown away.<//Text>< Pictures>

First off I was dieing of a toothache:( I called this morning and they got me right in! Carol at the front desk was so nice and quick with all my paperwork and just made the whole process very smooth. Next I met with the x-ray tech Rozina and she was so sweet and very gentle and knew how to maneuver the awkward mouth pieces for me because I always have a hard time lol. Dr.Bryant was amazing, so thorough with all my options and advice of what I can do until my next appointment. Lastly the manager Lameica was soooooo Awesome! She made my experience so great, she was able to get me in and answer every question I had. We even all shared some laughs and love of every song that came on the radio while I was there:) so so so amazing I'm telling everyone to go here from now on!!!:)</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x808e403b4726b227:0x3bc13582303b3501<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

The ONLY I mean only way they will see you In a timely matter Is if your there for the orthodontist which Is the ONLY reason this isn't a one star review. Save your time, Save your money.

<review>I wish there were negative stars for this office. This place is truly horrible. Moreover, I am annoyed that you have responded to my review by providing me with an email and a phone number. Specially because I have spent hours trying to contact you multiple times.

First, over a year ago, I visited, called, and emailed your office multiple times to get my bill corrected. I even had to threatened one of your managers with taking you to small claims court if my bill wasn't corrected. The discrepancy was around $1,500.

More currently, I am struggling to transfer my case. Please understand that your choices have significant impact on the lives of your customers. It is not fair that you think it's okay to slack off in your job.

Cordially,</review></record></dataset><record>

We made appointment with Western Dental about 10 days ago, gave all of the insurance info to the office.
But after 10 days waiting, we showed up at their office, the reception clerk told us their dentists are not contracted with our insurance!

Why they can not verify the info before we came in? The strange answer is: “ we did not make appointment, our Cooperation made!” So why you did not variety it after your Cooperation made it? Great answer: “ I was not in the office until today!”

You deserve 0 star!</text>

Avoid this place at all cost - I wish I could give zero stars.

I made an appointment for my sons 6 weeks ago.  Filled out all documents online as requested.

Arrived at 3:45 for our 4:00 PM appointment.  Had to fill all documents out again, apparently "the system sometimes doesn't work".

Waited in the lobby for over 90 minutes because the receptionist had to verify codes with the insurance. Shouldn't that have been done before we arrived?  And calling the insurance for a few codes takes 90 Minutes? Really?

At 5:15 we were finally ask to go to the treatment rooms.  There a doctor told us they could only do x-rays today, not the scheduled check-up for the boys because this would take too long.  The doctor's shift was over at 6 PM, and she wouldn't be able to finish in the remaining time.

She then told us to come back some other day, because, you know, it was getting close to the end of her shift. When I pointed out that we were on time for our 4:00 PM appointment and were made to wait, she told me that it is normal to wait one or two hours at any Western Dental, even if you have an appointment.  Good to know.

Clearly my time is not their priority, advanced scheduling is pointless, and customer service has been replaced with blatant arrogance.  If you value your dignity and your personal time, I suggest you stay away from Western Dental.</Text>

<review>I told my insurance to PLEASE not send me to a WD since the one experience I had years ago with one in SJ where I waited for 4 hours before giving up on my appointment. They did anyways so I decided that all I could do was give it a chance. I asked for a Saturday appointment since I am a single parent who works full time all week. I went in thinking that they’d check my benefits before I came in but of course they didn’t & because my insurance was closed I wasted one of my 1st Saturdays off in weeks driving an hour FOR NOTHING, & now have to wait another month to try again. Thanks for proving me right about the incompetence that has become the culture of WD & completely wasting my time.<//review>< GmapID>

Nice front desk but the biggest waste of time. Rescheduled and left after waiting 1.5hr for my initial visit. I would still be waiting for another 45min at least due to understaffing.
I suggest giving clients estimate wait time upon arrival. Too bad I'm only allowed to go to this dentist with California dental network on this side of 17.< /Text>

Had 23000 In dental work done on payments and insurance. payed the last 2100 in cash and then 5 years went by and I get a call from collections  saying I still owe didn’t have the receipt anymore showing it was paid. Pretty sure receptionist pocketed the cash and hand wrote a receipt. I  went in and asked what was going on they wouldn’t give me any information on what I supposedly owe and refused me service for over due bill. I got partials that never fit right they said I would get used to them hurting. Instead of fixing them. Had multiple teeth pulled that probably didn’t need pulled and fillings that fell out. So if you use them be sure to keep all receipts for years and don’t expect quality work< /text>

<Review>I’m a regular at Western Dental, if you have any type of work that you’d like to get done here always ask for Sareh! She’s an excellent dental assistant that truly cares for her patients and makes sure their needs are well-met.

< Review>
I've been going to Western Dental for a couple of years and I've seen a steady Improvement in every aspect. I only had to wait about 20 minutes for my appointment. The receptionist was polite and professional, the nurses were polite and x-rays wern't painful anymore. The dentist was very accessible and a good communicator. I had a lot of questions about my dental issues.< /Review>

Not going to pick on Santa Cruz office. That’s too easy. My message is simple ... Western Dental is an embarrassment to itself. Founded in 1903 and still operating like a 1903 business. Zero coordination between offices. My transfer from San Diego to Santa Cruz is a debacle with each office citing the other as ‘incompetent’. They’re both right. My life experience in changing dentist is that the new dentist request records from the old dentist. Not according to the Santa Cruz office. So I decided to retrieve records from San Diego office myself as requested by Santa Cruz office. Showing up for first appointment was advised the records I have did not include ‘audit’ docs. First time anyone mentioned this. They refused treatment and canceled the appointment. After more questions I come to understand that ‘audit’ docs pertained to my account and they needed to calculate their share of the money. Instead of treating my son and figuring that out latter they refused to treat the client. Yes! My account is in 100% good standing. Don’t recall ever doing business that treated a customer in this manner. Simply put these folks are clueless and I presume founder Dr. Beauchamp to be turning in his grave. Heed my advise and take your business elsewhere. Their hours for orthodontic are also limited to Tuesday’s and one Saturday a month. Other then that the staff was really nice.<//Review>

<user_id>105037377786051395502< /user_id><review>EDIT: I will say the staff are friendly and try their best with the terrible management, but avoid this place if possible.

Honestly the worst dental experience of my life. Literally had everything filled out and ready for them at 9:15 am for a 9:30 appointment time. The receptionist then asks for a piece of information not requested by the forms I was given prior to arriving (would have easily had that if they had asked me for it at all), then proceeding to delay every person who arrives either with an appointment or not. I saw people come in after me get seen before me. After waiting for over 1.5 hours I finally am taken back to do the x-rays. Not only does this process take longer than any other dentist or orthodontist I have been to, but then they make you wait again. This time the wait was only 1 hour before they had someone check my gums. Finally, after that 2.5 hour ordeal I am told there is ANOTHER WAIT before they can begin the cleaning. The one I requested for at 930 am. Not only that, but the wait was expected to be another 2 HOURS????

This place exists solely to waste your time, go literally ANYWHERE ELSE. Do not ever use unless you want to test your level of patience.</review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Stay away from Western Dental! The level of incompetence is mind blowing. I had two small fillings done there five months ago, one on each side of my mouth. Last week I had to have them check the one on my right side because I haven't been able to eat on that side since receiving the filling as it is too sensitive. They told me that it may have not been filled with enough material to cover the cavity. Then, two days ago the other filling just chipped off of my tooth! I called to make an appointment and the person I talked to had a very heavy accent and couldn't remember the English word for "filling." I went in to have them look at it today and was in the waiting area for 45 minutes when Western Dental called and left a message that I had missed my appointment! I checked with the front desk and the girl who checked me in appeared to be flustered and obviously forgot to check me in. Finally, 1.5 hours after my appointment time someone called me in to take x-rays of my tooth before the dentist even looked at it! The woman did not position the tool in my mouth correctly and asked me to bite down and it jabbed into my mouth. I told her if I bit down any more my mouth would start bleeding. She asked me if I needed numbing cream and told me in an annoyed tone that the x-rays needed to get done somehow. Finally, she re-positioned in my mouth correctly and continued with the first x-ray which she did not get the roots in the shot so she had to re-take it. Then I had to sit in the x-ray room for another 10 minutes while a chair was being cleaned. I was taken there and sat for another 20 minutes and left to look at a dirty wall and floor and I was getting stressed because I had to be somewhere and it was almost two hours past my original appointment time and no one bothered to let me know what was going on! Finally, a woman saw my frustration and tried to calm me down and got a dentist to look at my broken filling. The dentist basically said, yes, it came off sorry about that we will have to fix it. I was unable to wait the 15 more minutes or so to have her numb me and fix it so now I have to wait five more days with tooth sans filling for another appointment. I then called Western Dental to make sure I was marked as present for my appointment for insurance purposes and they had to call to verify that I was there. I also wanted to make a complaint about my service and was transferred and waited for ten minutes(when it said the wait was under 1 minute) and finally hung up. I could not let them waste another minute of my time but then here I am writing this review wasting more time.<//Text>< gmap_id>

Years ago, they told me my only option was to pull my front tooth.  Under pressure and argument,   I said "hell no and jumped out of my chair.  I found a good dentist and orthodontist  that repaired it and  that same tooth today is  beautiful and 100%  healthy.  You will be signing  all kinds of  papers promising not to sue Western dental  for any reason.   In my opinion:  Beware and Don't  trust them,  they will pull out all your teeth to make a buck.   F you western dental and especially to the incompetent dentist that tried to pressure me by pulling  his professional  BS with me.</text>

This office location is a joke. I went to the Santa Cruz location today because of how poorly I was treated at the watsonville location. Only to be turned away (SC office) because I didn't live in the area. Nobody told me that was a thing, very unprofessional. All I want is my tooth removed so I wouldn't be in severe pain and getting sick. Western Dental needs to do a complete overhaul of their staff, I wasted my time just to be told no. Word of advice don't choose this location.< /review>

<Text>The front desk is nice, however the office is very poorly managed. Long waits, people walking out due to never getting called, and some up-selling on uncovered treatments depending on your insurance.

Edit: Took over 3 hours just to have my routine check up.

<review>Bruised my gums for a placeholder crown as they had to numb me + reinsert the placeholder crown twice, only to have their dentist cancel on me when I needed to install the actual crown. Combine that with a 2PM appointment lasting all day, and you've got yourself one boondoggle of a dentist. Never. Again. If you're looking for a dentist who knows what they're talking about, hit up dentists in Watsonville. There's many great choices.</review></record></dataset><record>

I filled out paper work and then waited. I was told that I was next in line. I waited AN HOUR AND 20 MINUTES. When I asked what was taking so long the clerk told me that if I had a braces appointment at 8:45 I should have said it was for BRACES specifically so I could be sent to the back to my appointment! So I MISSED MY APPOINTMENT and sat there for an hour or more unknowingly.  Unbelievable! So they can't see in their system that I have two appointments and what they are for?! It's the front desk's JOB to  direct people where to go and make sure they are getting seen at the proper times.

Western dental does not deserve even 1 star! DO NOT USE THIS FACILITY! Understaffed (their excuse why it takes 2 hours to be seen) and the work they do is horrible. THEY LIE! They don’t have adequate doctors or staff! Oh and if you have a tooth ache? No emergency appointments they made me wait 4 weeks in PAIN and then made me wait an additional 3 WEEKS just to come in and start the treatment.<//Text>

They don't have drinking water in office and they don't have hand sanitizer at front desk and not clean office and of course you should wait hours inside the waiting room before you get treated.

It doesn't matter how many doctors work there, they will just give appointments to everyone and will ask you to wait in the office.

No one in the office knows how much time it will take to treat one patient. Overall, I am glad to have experienced this, Now I understood the importance of the reviews.</Text><gmapID>0x808e403b4726b227:0x3bc13582303b3501< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

These a**holes literally just canceled my appt while I was in the waiting room because the dentist didn't feel like doing anymore.
And please don't send me a BS reply if you're not going to actually try to correct yourselves.< /review>

Under new Management! I know this place has had bad rap and I used to be right there with you. But it's a whole new crew top notch. All ran by the best in the business Lameica Wharton. She will make sure you get the care you need. At a price that works with your budget. We all know a trip to the dentist is not cheap. But at Western Dental on Ocean Street and with Lameica by your side at least it's affordable and without sacrificing quality of service. There so good I literally feel asleep during an implant procedure.<//review>

<review>This place is so ghetto that I've seen brighter, cleaner and more professional medical offices in the crumbling parts of eastern Europe, back when any country there was referred to as being part of a 'bloc.'

I was referred to this place not only by my insurance company, but the office itself. When I took off of work and drove all the way to Santa Cruz for my dental appointment, I waited several minutes to receive help. Finally, a receptionist who does all of her work on speaker phone (for the entire waiting room to hear; hello, patient information is private!) addressed me and finally told me that neither of the doctors available were under my insurance. She then proceeded to imply that I never called their office in the first place - that I had called corporate and had been misinformed. Either way, someone there dropped the ball on me because now I could not see anyone and had to reschedule. The same receptionist then suggested that I see one of the doctors as an out-of-network option, and that I could pay out of pocket for such things as exam, cleaning and x-rays. Really?! First I lose pay by taking off of work, then I'm out $2,000 to see a dentist in your ghetto office? No thanks.

The same receptionist then proceeded to publicly dial my insurance company, with volume turned all the way up on speaker phone. After three attempts she said she'd call them back and let me know the "coverage" verdict by the end of the day. Well, it's now 6:36 pm, and no one from that office has called me back.

Save your time, money - and possibly, health - and go somewhere else, folks.

When I left, I saw an empty parking lot space with what appeared to be window glass all over the ground. Impressive, Western Dental!<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>{'time': 1452892915410, 'text': 'Hello Leena,\n\nWe are very sorry to hear that your experience did not meet your expectations, and apologize for any inconvenience.

<Date>1442070682576</Date><Rate>1</Rate><Review>I go to WD only because that's all my insurance would cover, but if I could change I would. They have two days where their braces department (Blanking on the official name) is open, so they have to see every one of their patients in that time. Then if you call you're put on hold for up to an hour because "there is one patient ahead of you". I call bull. They had someone there who was wonderful - Liana - but she quit to move, and it went downhill from there.

Edit: they are now only open on Mondays (with one Saturday a Month) with the first appointment at 9. As a full time student that is unfeasible, and makes it impossible. I am disgusted by their employees nature, they don't care one bit.
I am so glad I'm moving, and am "due to get [my] braces off soon" (cause they REFUSE to tell me a time!) Because I never have to deal with them again.</Review>< Pics>

I have to go here because of my insurance but if you have a choice DO NOT GO HERE. It was the absolute worst experience I have ever had at a dentist. The dentist was hurried, rough, and unfriendly and they made me wait literally hours for a routine cleaning.

First visit: I went in for a cleaning/check-up. They made me wait so long they couldn't even finish the cleaning that day and made me schedule another appointment. Who does that? When I came back, the dentist gave me the most painful cleaning of my entire life. I was almost in tears by the end of it.

Second visit: Again I went in for a cleaning/check-up. After waiting a total of 2 hrs while only completing half of my cleaning, I asked when the dentist was going to finish my cleaning. They told me it will be another 45 minutes. At that point I had had enough and left.

Overall: The facility was dingy and there are no private rooms. The receptionists were nice and helpful. The hygienists were efficient but distracted and did not explain why everything took so long. The dentist was completely unprofessional, rude, and incompetent.</Text>

My experience with Western Dental was a positive one overall.  I did wait for about 25 minutes before I was seen, but the staff members were very polite and friendly, and they did notify me of the delay.  Once I was called in, the xray technician was professional and complete, answering my questions. Same with the Dentist and assisting staff. The entire process, xrays and exam took about 1.5 hours. I felt they did a complete and through job. Recommendations for further work seem sound. They also gave me info on outside financing options which I appreciate.</Text>

<review>If I could give less than one star I would. The office workers are rude and untrained. If your appointment is even kept by them (they have canceled me 3x without telling me) the wait is usually at least an hour. There are no actual rooms, your just all shoved into one big room like cattle. This place is awful.  The girl that I was sitting next to last time said she had been waiting two hours for them to see her because they did a root canal on the wrong tooth. They did a tooth extraction on me and only pulled half the tooth and I had to threaten them and bother them in person three different times and show them the piece of broken Tooth that was sticking out of the side of my gum. They are HORRIBLE. I so wish I was able to pay for my dental work and not have these people do it just because they take medi-cal. Don't be poor kids, you'll get the worst possible treatment if you are!</review>< Pictures>

I just called and decided to cancel my appointment after the phone experience and the reviews. I'm usually really nice on the phone but the receptionist (Strong Spanish accent) seems to be having a bad day because she was rude and annoyed with me. Based on that poor customer service experience and the horrible reviews from people who actually went in, I'm staying away from there!< /Text>

Okay, this is the DEAL. I would have given 5 stars if it was not for the girls in the front, not welcoming at all, they do not talk unless they are spoken too and they are not rude but definitely NOT friendly. The doctor was ok. he could of spent more time, and been more thorough. However.. the WHOLE REASON I GAVE 4 STARS WAS FOR THE OFFICE MANAGER. LAMEIKA ( sorry if I spelled it wrong) She is EXTREMELY FRIENDLY, THOROUGH, AND HER CUSTOMER SERVICE SKILLS IS AMAZING. SHE IS THE ONLY REASON I WILL BE RETURNING .</review>

First time I came with an appointment they told me the dentist was running behind and wouldnt be seeing anymore patients for the day. No call ahead of time. I rescheduled and came in a second time. This time I sat in the waiting room for 45 minutes before I got up and left. During that time two separate people came in complaining about receiving calls for bills they had already paid. I'll try to find another dentist my insurance accepts.< /Review>

Look it up.  Literally hundreds of reviews just like these for Western Dental as well as several past and pending mal practice suits across the United States.  These guys are hacks with a turn em and burn em  mentality. Its all about the money.

I know that Western Dental is low cost and accepts state dental insurance but if you have any choice in the matter don't stop here! Move on!  South of the Mexico border would be better.<//text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

In agreement with everyone else. Although the staff is nice, they schedule terribly here. Expect what should be an hour long dentist visit to be more like 3 hours. Also, expect to reschedule as they consistently overbook (I don't know why I keep coming back here). As I sit here I've seen at least three patients complain about the poor service. Also multiple people have walked in expecting to be booked but someone screwed up their appointments. Save yourself trouble and don't come here.< /review>

Both times I've been I've waited over an hour and a half just to be seen. I went back to get my fillings done and the doctor hardly spoke to me. She then numbed me and then basically disappeared for 30 minutes without saying anything. She only became attentive after I made it clear that I had work and had to leave. She only did two of the four fillings I needed. Basically don't come here unless you plan on spending all of your day here.
This place is very unprofessional and I will not be wasting my time here again .
I felt very uncomfortable like nobody knew what they were doing</Text>

So my wife went in for wisdom teeth removal, and to start things off, she overheard the doctor complaining on how he just wanted to get over it so he could go home. Overall she was in and out in less than an hour so i dont know if thats normal but this morning she woke up and had a big swollen piece of skin hanging from her gums. I havent been able to find any post wisdom teeth removal pictures to match what it looks like. But she is going back in to get it checked out.< /review>

tip for dr sascha emami: telling somebody you know nothing about that it's their fault for having infected teeth while you're drilling into an un-numbed nerve isn't a great way to make them feel like they shouldn't "hold it against" you

edit: i forgot to mention that i get to pay them 500 dollars now for something they didn't tell me about until right before the procedure! yay!<//Text>

HORRIBLE!!! Save yourself the frustration and a whole lot of time and go somewhere that an appointment means something!!  Appointment for a 5 year old child's Kindergarten check up was at 1:45. After watching people come in after us and be called in before us and me being told they only had 2 dentists and 4 assistants working that day and they were just fitting people in we were finally called in at 3:00!  It was after 4 when we finally got out of there.
Same thing happened the following Monday with next child's checkup appt. Appointment for 12:45 not out until after 3!  If there were other dentists we could find in the area that accepted MediCal for We would NEVER go there again. Am going to do serious hunting for someplace else before they are ready for checkups again!

0 stars! These people treated me terribly. Very long wait times (4 hours for a teeth cleaning appointment that I showed up early to! 4.5 hours for an x ray appointment!!). Severely understaffed. They actually billed my insurance for a teeth cleaning that I never received. Unbelievable.< /review>

This was the worst medical experience of my life. I saw the low rating and figured dental care couldn't possibly range in quality that much. IT CAN. My experience was horrific. Dr Vu was nice and helpful and pretty laid back which I appreciate. Dr Emami and the dental assistants are awful at their jobs and entirely unprofessional. No one seemed to understand how to use the equipment and Dr Emami was pompous and rude. He made awful jokes concerning my pain. He threatened me when I subconsciously tried to grab his hand because I was not numb enough to have him pull out my teeth. They kept me on the gas the entire time and it truly made me more scared than calm. Watching the dental assistants try to figure out how to use the nitrous dispenser wasn't helpful either. He was dismissive of my pain and treated me like a burden.  I won't be going back.<//Text>

Not only were they 30minutes late, we had 18 x-rays. When i asked why so many, the technician explained that this is normal, and every dentist does this. I have never had that many x-rays at the same time in my life. After that was supposed to be our consultation and then a cleaning. As i was waiting for the consultation i was approached by a staff member who told me they were running behind and it would be at least an hour. The cleaning would be after that, so we were looking at an additional 2 hours. My wife and i decided to leave and had to schedule another appointment for 3 weeks later. The front dest staff were non-responsive, un-helpful and looked bored out of their minds. We will give this one more shot, but it is like this again, i'll cancel my dental insurance and pay full price elsewhere.< /Text>< user>

I scheduled a 9AM appointment. I waited until 9:20 when I was told that the dentist would not be there until 10. I rescheduled in two weeks at 10. I asked if the dentist would be there at that time. The receptionist said "I don't know" and that they don't write the schedules that far out.</Text>

This place is amazing! I called to ask for a diagnosis for my car. Peter picked up and he's extremely friendly and helpful. I arrived and they checked my car immediately with no wait time. They even offered me a ride home. Peter is very professional and he helped me resolve the issue. This is the best auto repair shop I've ever been to. I would definitely visit again if I ever need service. Thank you Peter!

I chose this place because I need to wait at least 2 weeks for my dealership but this place can check my car the same day afternoon. In addition, this shop has amazing decorations inside and I feel like I'm at a really cool car museum. All the staff there are extremely friendly. I even got to see a pink ice cream truck!<//Review>

Really cute retro shop here with really nice people like a family. Fyel at Laguna Woods fixed my trunk and I'm super grateful after walking out of my local toyota center having wasted 2 hours with them. So Fyel talked to me over the phone since I was already pretty frustrated and apprehensive and he was fair and direct which persuaded me to go to their shop and I'm so thankful I finally got my car fixed.<//review>

Bob and his crew are the best!  I know my cars are in good hands.  They are upfront about what is needed and what can wait.  Their work is impeccable.  And they genuinely care about me and my family.  I always have a few of their business cards on hand to give out when asked if I have a good mechanic.< /text>

I have had a 5 star experience at Laguna Wood Auto Repair every time. Christmas Eve they were open half day. The crew, always friendly and knowledgable, got me in and fixed my problem quickly. I am beyond thankful to have their experience available to keep my cars in excellent operating condition. Thanks Bob, Tony, Peter, and the rest of the crew. You're the best!<//review>

Laguna Woods Auto Is trustworthy. I’ve been taking my Jeep to there for as long as I’ve owned it. They are honest, give very reasonable pricing, do excellent work, and treat you with kindness and respect. There’s no reason to take my Jeep anywhere else.

A very satisfied customer,

<text>I have always had excellent service from Laguna Woods Auto Repair.  After an exorbitant estimate from Toyota of Irvine for a display monitor at 30k miles in 2010, LWAR repaired it with brand new factory parts for less than 25% of the dealerships estimate.  Regular maintenance is less than the dealer, service is excellent, reliable and they never do unnecessary repairs or maintenance ever.  Nice to find a repair shop with friendly service along with high ethics & integrity.<//text><username>Judy Majer< /username><user_id>113710041578845115662</user_id>< rate>

Went there yesterday after multiple personal referrals and then I saw their reviews. My car wasn't running right, a week earlier, it started shaking and trembling. Freyl figured it out, told me what to expect and was exceedingly kind because I insisted it had a problem. I am so grateful, thankful, etc.. I will never go anywhere else. I only went to dealers in the past...not now.< /review>

Nothing but positive accolades for this repair shop. I got a complete detailed analysis of my old Prius for free. I then chose the most important repair, which was half the estimate of the dealer. No upselling or phony emergency fixes. Plus their shop is very cool looking and the guys treat you puke a person not a number. Good job guys!< /Review>

I recently took my new, GE Leasing, Mercedes C250, in for its first routine service and was very pleased with the work done my the fine staff at Laguna Woods / Leisure World Auto. They have been servicing my personal vehicles for some time but this was the first time I took a new car in for service.

Very delighted to find out that they accept the GE Leasing purchase orders and billing for service. Made my life a lot easier.

I would recommend this shop. Clean, neat, orderly and they speak 'plain-talk' when discussing needed repairs.< /review>

Well, the owner, Bob, really knows his stuff when it comes to the peculiar nature of solving car mechanical problems. I take my jaguar to him when needed because I know things will get fixed correctly and it for any reason they are not right after a repair, he and his staff will find and solve the problem until there is no problem. Onward and upward then with respectful regards, Scott Lemriel (AKA - R. Scott Rochek)< /Review>

>>STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE<<
Very rude people specially Nick, horrible customer service, NOT MILITARY FRIENDLY AT ALL, I asked for a discount and first he told me he'll give 10% than when the bill came I asked where is the discount and he was like I gave you $50 off. the total bill was $1400, I'll give them the benefit of the doubt, maybe they only know how to do math so they can profit. the car was returned to me with a new issue, leaking oil like NEVER BEFORE, took it back and they wanted $900, told me it was one thing first, and then they told me something different and on top of that they returned my car with missing hardware. I know because I'm a mechanic myself and the only owner of the vehicle. They pray on old customers so stay away!< /Text>

I have had only good experiences with Laguna Woods Auto Repair. They helped me out of a place who was going to repair my car where it wasn't needing repairs done. I use my car for Lyft and it is always running perfectly. I am always confident when I drive my car that I will make it to my destination and back safely. Today I have to drive for 1 1/2 hour trip, one way, and 1 1/2 hour back. I am confident I will be ok because it will be rolling over 100,000 miles. Yeah to them and they deserve their 5 stars. The waiting room has a great ambience with a tv and everyone is very nice, too.<//text>

Very clean shop. I have a small fleet of buses and have been to many local repair shops only to have bad work.
When I found Bob , I found heaven,
he is honest, fair and right on top of it.
You have to try this shop. no one better< /text>< Pics>

<username>Raz Hazan<//username><Review>Last night just 30 minutes prior to close time at Laguna Woods Auto Repair, I brought my car to be looked at as I had just driven over a large Metal rod on the freeway and it broke a cover off of the bottom of my Chasis.
The owner, Bob, didn't hesitate to take a look under my car and was honest enough to tell me that there was no real damage or any Leaking as I feared and that only the cover had broken off.
As I was getting ready to leave, Bob, noticed that I wasn't very comfortable so he offered to lift my car and have one of his mechanics show me that there was NO real damage to worry about and that the car was safe to drive!!!  He did all of this and didn't charge me a "dime".
I never met Bob before, but as all of us always look for an Honest mechanic....I was glad I did.....now I will be a new customer of Bob's shop for ALL 3 of my cars.
Thank you! Raz< /Review><Time>1410293453575<//Time>< Rating>

I had a really great experience with Dr. Webb and his team. I was referred by Vacavalley Dental to Dr. Webb and I have to admit, I was extremely nervous and a little depressed about having a tooth extracted.

From the time I walked in the door, the staff were extremely welcoming, compassionate, informative, and reassuring.  Dr. Webb was extremely knowledgeable and transparent about the process.  He provided information on the available options and outlined a recommendation on the best course of treatment.  His humor during the appointment relieved my anxiety and stress and provided me with the reassurance to move forward with the extraction.

The procedure was hands down, the best dental procedure that I have ever gone through.  I felt no pain during or after the procedure.  I was even able to get on a flight at 6 am the following morning.  I can’t thank Dr. Webb and his team at Northern California Facial & Oral Surgery enough for the care and treatment that I received.  I highly recommend this Team!<//text>

Perfect place for facial and oral surgery. Had my 1st experience of wisdom teeth removal and I was well taken care of. Dr. Webb and everybody were awesome to give the best care they can give.<//review>

Ive avoided addressing some issues for a long time because of my distain for having my mouth worked on and the numerous visits required. I'm so grateful I found Dr. Webb, he is an absolute stud and totally made me comfortable, as well the surgery was a breeze from my perspective and I had no pain after 4 extractions and 2 implants. You wont regret a visit to Dr. Webb, his staff is phenomenal and extremely competent and kind. Super happy I ended up there, and that I don't dread my visits back.<//text>

<Review>I was a little nervous about getting the oral surgery and implant. From the first appointment they were very reassuring and explained everything about the process to both me and my husband. The procedure required two appointments with sedation. Both went fine with no issues. There was hardly any pain, and everything has now healed nicely. I will be going to regular dentist soon for the crown to finish it off . Would highly recommend.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

<Review>Dr. Web is very knowledgeable the
his work excellentt he's very personable and very thorough about explaining every detail to you. His assistant Joel is very helpful and kind. The procedure was very is painless.. I have an extraction and a implant placef the work is done perfectly!
I also had a frenconectomy he did well, but it did not go well , my tongue has regressed and I have server paresthesia, no fault of Dr Webbs, that happens I understand this. He did adress this and tryed his best help this be resolved.

The weakness is with the front office staff, there was not clarity on procedures billing amounts, also I was Dr Webb's last patient and instead of one of the staff staying, they left him in the office alone with me, which being in this field in the past. I know is not wise, it's not safe for the doctor's reputation nor the patients comfort.

Overall without hesitation I will go back to Dr Webb if I need any other oral suergy work done!!!</Review>< Name>

This review is long over due. I wanted to thank Dr. Webb and the entire professional staff for taking good care of me. I had my top wisdom teeth removed. Dr. Webb was extremely professional in addressing all of my concerns. He also took the time to talk to me about other procedures I am interested in. My surgery went extremely  well, I felt no pain and I recovered much faster than I anticipated. I am so thankful fo the outstanding care. I will be back!!!<//Review>

<Review>This review is long overdue.
Dr. Webb is truly an amazing Doctor.
I came in as a referral for my wisdom teeth, my case was severe because my wisdoms were on the nerve. I was terrified, due to my previous dentist making me feel extremely uncomfortable because of my age (24). Dr. Webb ensured me that I was in good hands throughout the whole entire process and made sure to address all of my concerns before and after the surgery.
The surgery went amazing as well as my recovery.
He even took the time to talk to me about other facial procedures I am interested in getting in the near future.
Thank you SOOO MUCH Dr. Webb!
I’ll be seeing you soon!< /Review>< Pics>

He punctured my wife's sinus and then he denied doing it. My wife had to have sinus surgery at Kaiser because he would not take care of the issue. Not to mention the fact that he is very unprofessional when he is dealing with females. He has a history of making women feel uncomfortable in a flirtatious manor.< /review>

<Rate>1</Rate><text>Dr. Webb as a person is pretty cool, as a Dentist thats another story. He is overbooked and always in a Rush. I had a implant removed and bone graph put in, and one week later I was in so much pain that I had to come to the emergency room. He never told me not to use mouthwash after I saw him for the second time 4 days later. In regards to pricing hes worse than a used car salesman, starts up really high an in close to 5000$ for an implant removal and bone graph, and eventually did it for 2500 which is still overpriced.
I highly suspect that he has his dental assistants do the sowing after hes done which thats not allowed. Hes slick and acts like if hes your best friend. I DONT TRUST HIM.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x8085181ddd694287:0xdbd51b9fb7269941< /gmapID></record>

Dr. Webb pulled 3 of my wisdom teeth on 08/02/2019. I was a difficult case but he made me feel 100% confident that he knew what he was doing. The surgery went smooth and I am healing very well! Thanks Dr.Webb and your team! I am so thankful.</review>

I was feeling a little "spry" so I decided to post this:

In addition to all of the below mentioned positive reviews, the staff is personable, beautiful, and professional.

Being comfortable before/during/after any surgery is reassuring for a patient, you will feel comfortable here.

Dr. Webb is straight forward, confident, and energetic.  This man is a fearless and unbelieveably sharp jack of all trades.  We need more people in the medical field to have the ethics and decisiveness that Dr. Webb does.

Thank you for your service, both before, and during your practice.</Review>

Extracting my wisdom teeth was way less painful than having my tongue pierced. The procedure took at most 15 minutes, 10-13 for the local anesthesia to set in then two minutes extracting my two wisdom teeth. I was in such disbelief and shock that my teeth have even been removed until Dr. Webb showed them to me because I felt nothing but slight pressure. It was quick, easy and painless and I have yet to feel any pain several hours later, Dr. Webb and his staff made me feel super comfortable and all around super professional! I would definitely recommend him!</review>

This guy truly loves what he does. I went in to have what I thought was only one wisdom tooth removed, and I quickly learned that there was all 4. When he came into the office, the whole room shifted. He brings joy to hard situations and gives you this feeling of everything is going to work out.. and it did, way more than I could have even hoped for. Dr. Webb noticed I had a lisp and took a look at my tongue and noticed I was tongue tied! Without even a second thought, he just said "Let's do both surgeries at once!" He made the whole process actually enjoyable, which is really difficult to do with oral surgery. I can't recommend this guy (and his amazing staff) enough. Please don't hesitate or look any further for your oral or cosmetic surgery, this is your guy!< /text>

My teenage daughter recently had her wisdom teeth extracted by Dr. Webb.  We had a great experience!  The front staff made a great first impression.  They were kind and professional from scheduling the consult appointment to the follow up.  Dr. Webb eased my daughter’s fears in the consult about pain and called and texted a few days after to check on her.  I would highly recommend getting your wisdom teeth extracted by Dr. Webb!< /review>

<Text>My Son and I both have had positive experiences with Dr. Webb.  My son is really shy and Dr Webb had him talking and laughing.  He had all his wisdom teeth removed. I was able to call Dr Webb to discuss concerns after surgery the same night and he was able to reassure me.  More recently, I had some implants done.  I thought it was a touching bonus that he called me (several times because I didn't recognize the number) to check how I was doing and even texted me as well.  His staff is very courteous and professional.  I had to go back and forth with insurance and each time I called Katie she was great.  I would definitely recommend Dr Webb.</Text><gmap_id>0x8085181ddd694287:0xdbd51b9fb7269941< /gmap_id><rate>5</rate><user_id>111397194301884409557</user_id></record></dataset><record>

Answered every question i had and thoroughly explained everything. Staff was helpful and professional durring the entire process. Was recommended this place after a family member got her wisdom teeth extracted here and was extremely pleased coming here myself. Would high recommend to friends and family.

EDIT: Wouldn’t recommend to anyone i care about. if you want GOOD dental work done with GOOD MORAL & LEGAL VALUES/PRACTICES in mind, then go somewhere else. Would also not recommend as a place to work.< /review>

Dr. Webb and his staff are very compassionate and I was there for oral surgery and Dr. Webb will be the only oral surgeon I ever see. He will be having to remove all my top teeth due to another dental clinic that ruined my teeth. The way he explained everything to me made me understand how important it is that it get done to avoid a very serious situation. So he brought to light to me that years ago when the past dentist here in Vacaville did not do one thing right for me in fact my situation is far worse NOW and will hv to have Dr. Webb remove all my top teeth which is heartbreaking as im still fairly young. At least I know whats ahead of me and the Board will be involved due to the past present and future pain and suffering I have am and will be going through.

<text>Dr Webb, is wonderful. I've suffered with Crohn disease for 35 years, and I've seen dozens and dozens of  doctors.  I can say Dr Webb is in the top 5. He has a great "bed side" manner and quickly put me at ease. I felt completely  confident  putting my medical care in his hands .<//text>< pictures>

Dr. Webb was awesome. My Auntie Dr. Janet Cubol refered me to him. He Did my wisdom tooth extraction and it was a successful surgery. Very nice clinic, nice view, great staff. Dr. Webb would take time to answer your questions and explain the procedure.<//text>

<Text>I have been going here for 40+ years. It is family owned and run by one family, and it is a clean and friendly place. The food does not disappoint, and it is worth the drive from anywhere in the Bay Area. One of the last, really good Mexican food places. Worth a trip to try it!</Text><name>Dan Dalal<//name>< time>

< Review>
Queso fundito and a michelada was 28.00.
It was not a good drink and the fundito was way too salty and I ran out of chips. They were out of chorizo.

The refried beans and rice on my friends plate  looked good, but the carne asada, not so much. A few tablespoons were in my fundito, which costed 4.00 extra.

I love Mexican food but this was my first and last visit.<//Review>

Prices are as reasonable as ever. Wait staff is friendly and attentive, much like the previous owners. As a 20-year patron of this restaurant, who resisted the 'recent' changing of the guard, I was pleasantly surprised with both the quality and pride of service. Would recommend, and will always remember the portrait lined walls and virgin strawberry daquiris of my youth. A timeless hang-out, run by unforgettable people!< /Text><Resp>None</Resp><rating>5< /rating></record>

<review>Had the carnitas.  It was delicious.  Nice little place in the middle of town.  Kind of your neighborhood restaurant.  Has a small bar area and if you live by and want to watch a game with your friend (singular) not much room.  Plenty of onsite restaurant parking and street parking.<//review>< pictures>

<Text>We go for Mr. Bill...the host is Old School charm. He LOVES his customers and we love him. That being said, the food is alright, portions are small, and definitely overpriced. The Small guacamole appetizer was maybe 4 oz, the size of a "side" IMO, and paid $6! Margarita was good, but for $10 they could put real strawberries. As I said, we go to see Mr. Bill. He's the main attraction.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

This is an awesome authentic tasting Mexican restaurant. They have a good menu selection and have full bar. The employees are very attentive and cater to your needs very well. This is one of the top Mexican restaurants on the island and I highly recommend it.<//review>

<text>I was not pleased with my $13 burrito and the flavor was pretty good but it was dry and the portion was Tiny. My friends plate came incorrect and was a struggle to get corrected.
I can't wait to go to Juan's place in West Berkeley they never let me down with their excellent and attentive serving skills!

<review>My family and I have been coming here for 50+ years that tells you how good it Was... Went today and it will definitely be mind and my family's last time.  My friend was throwing up an hour after we ate (meat) and I was finishing mine and the whole stem of the Chile was still attached.  The waitress needs to work on her customer service maybe the bus boy can teach her he was much better.  It is really ashame!<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

<Text>Had a delicious dinner at the Acapulco.  We were pleasantly surprised with how good our experience.  Chilli rellenos were really delicious as were the chicken enchiladas.  Service was very good and the resturant was clean.  I have been bothered by how dirty a popular Alameda Mexican resturant is.  This will be our choice from now on< /Text></record>

Comfortable setting with hospitable hosts. Some items aren't always consistent (like the Colorado dinner plate) but I've always enjoyed their specials. Would recommend their specials menu and homemade flan. It's also easy to order take out over the phone and they've only given me an incorrect take out once.< /review>

Great slight "hole in the wall" Mexican restaurant.  The owner often stops by your table to say hello.  The booths are a touch run-down but the food is good and the service is great.

Be a touch wary of the specials thought.  They are delicious but can often be very spicy (and I like spicy food but the shrimp was powerful beyond belief).</review>

<review>Please don't go here! I mean... It's amazing and I want to keep it all to myself. A hidden gem with the best mole I've ever had in my life. Reminded me of upscale dining in Mexico - beautiful relaxed but romantic atmosphere with friendly and professional staff. It's a bit pricey, but definitely worth it. We ordered off the nightly specials: $17 for a rich and complex duck mole enchiladas and $21 for a large portion of fajitas bursting with depth of flavor. You can certainly get cheaper fajitas, but they won't be as good. The best Mexican on the island.</review>< userid>

This place has that old school Mexican restaurant vibe that I grew up with in SoCal. Fresh salsas, classic entree offerings and great Margaritas. I wish that the chips were a little fresher but it's not like that all the time.<//Review>

Our server Juan. Took almost a hour to bring our food and the restaurant was nearly empty.  We were charged a server fee of $19.00 on a bill that was $104.20.  It would have not, been so bad if we, would have seen the server more than 4 times;  once for the beverage order, the food order, serve us the food, and bring us the check. He sat a pitcher of water on the table, and never came back to refill the drinks.<//Review>

<review>This is my favorite Restaurant. It is hands down the most authentic Mexican food in all of the U.S. Seriously the Food Network needs to come to this Restaurant and see if Bobby Flay can live up to the challenge. The people, the food, the service is all top notch. I have never been to a place that has left me with so many leftovers. Honestly if you are in near or around the Alameda county area, you need to stop and eat at this restaurant. THE BEST +++< /review>< date>

Service was friendly but slow to take our order, so they made up for it with complimentary drinks. Super friendly staff. They were out of several types of meat so choices were limited. It was Cinco de Mayo and I think they were busier than expected. Queso fundido was delicious and chips were fresh and warm. I will go back again and give them another chance when it's not a celebration day.<//text>

<rate>5<//rate><Review>It may not be the same restaunt I grew up going to.. tho the location and name remained the same...the food has totally changed. It's really good cooking as long as you do not compare it to the original. Prices are not surprisingly higher, you'll pay $16 for a dinner plate. They skimp a little on the rice and beans in my opinion, but that's in comparison and being used to having a full lunch leftover from a dinner.<//Review>< pics>

This is a great place to grab a few drinks with friends or have dinner with family, place is large inside and allows for separation of various groups. And is not too busy, just right.< /text>

<review>Disappointed.  I used to love this restaurant, the food was really good.  Last time I went, the carne asada was extremely salty and way overcooked.  It used to be my favorite dish there, but it was so gross that I did not finish.  I will not go back.  I am very sad to have lost one of my favorite Alameda dinner places.< /review>< pics>

My wife and I had dinner at the new Alcapulco Restaurant in Alameda last week. It was perfect. We were long time customers of the old Alcapulco and weren't certain we would like the new Alcapulco. We do.
It has the same comfortable ambiance with service that is worthy of a five star restaurant. The food is excellent. I had the Chili Colorado—tender lean pieces of beef in their perfectly seasoned red sauce. We were pleased with everything we had. We will be back.<//Text>

Very clean and simple menu with rotating specials.  Our favorite is the carnitas plate and caldo de pollo (chicken veggie soup)  but their carne asada and pollo asada are very good as well.< /Review>

The service is wonderful and their food is the highest quality in Alameda IMO. My favorite is the chille relleno and the flan dessert.</Review>

Not really sure why I keep giving the food a chance. Both times I went, the chicken lacked flavor and the second time, the chicken was dry. I kiss the old family that used to run this place..</Review>

<review>(Translated by Google) I loved the food very good and especially excellent attention from the owner and the waiters.

I recommend it.

I like shrimp tacos so much that I can't try anything else. For my husband, it's the same for tamales.
Even my daughter, who never eats anything outside the home, as soon as the waiter arrives she asks for her quesadilla.
I like the place very much and the service is always courteous.

(Original)
Questo posto è una garanzia.
I tacos di gamberetti mi piacciono talmente tanto che non riesco a provare altro. Per mio marito è la stessa cosa per le tamales.
Anche mia figlia, che non mangia mai nulla fuori casa, appena arriva il cameriere chiede subito la sua quesadilla.
Il locale mi piace moltissimo e il servizio è sempre cortese.< /text><time>1530922664573</time></record>

I've only been a customer for about a year but will continue to go to Stone's for all my cat and dog supplies. They have excellent customer service--sales people areknowledgeable and caring so that going there has always been a truly wonderful experience. Forget about the big box stores or shopping online and give yourself a rate treat and visit Stone's.</review>

I have been going to stones pet shop for a few years now and I have literally nothing but good things to say.
1. They will order things in for you if they dont have it.
2. They will adjust prices if other places are selling for a lot cheaper.
3. The workers are super nice and knowledgeable on different topics. They are also honest when they dont know something. They wont just make up stuff (experienced this a lot at other places)
4. The owner is super helpful and involved in his store.
5. One of the best places in monterey to get aquarium necessities ordered. They add up a bunch of peoples orders to meet requirements for whole sale orders, then order them all from whole sale. They also dont mark up the fish too much. Theyll give you a call so you can be there when the whole saler drops off the fish, so theres less stress on the fish.</review>

Great people and great service.

Come for the pet supplies, stay for the BIRDS. Great, friendly service, good variety of products, price matching, military discount, etc. etc. but who cares about that stuff- come here for the birds. It's basically an aviary.</text>

<text>Tom and his friendly crew have always gone out of their way to make sure every customer gets exactly what they need for their pets. My husband and I have noticed how hard working every employee is each time we visit, and it shows. Not only is there a huge selection of high quality dog and cat food and accessories, but also a wonderful array of reptile, fish, and bird related items (I may be forgetting some things, there's a lot packed into one small store!). On the off chance that they don't have what you want, they will do their best to obtain it for you in a timely manner and at a fair price. Skip the big box stores, go to Stone's.</text><name>ash< /name><Rating>5</Rating><Pics>None<//Pics>< user_id>

<review>First off, the reason I rated the "Appeal" as "Very Good" instead of excellent is because this is not a couture pet boutique that you might find in Carmel. Instead, it is manned by very friendly and knowledgeable people who can give you educated advice ranging from what food you should give your hamster to fitting your dog for a harness (see other review). They also have a couple of groomers on board now, and I've heard that they are very good.

Anyway, their little space is crammed with high-quality pet diets & products. They sell crickets too. If you don't see what you want, you can ask the staff and they will often check their storage area or make a special order for you. Realize that Stone's carries predominantly pet PRODUCTS and does not sell animals (...although I think that they have some birds for sale?). It's a great place.

Highly recommended.</review>< pics>

Honestly they do a great job grooming, and the groomers are very talented/great with dogs. However, we have had THREE incidents of appointment mishaps, where they either didn't schedule us at all or they told us the wrong day or time. As a result we need to go somewhere else that keeps their appointments.</text>

Adorable pet shop, real hole in the wall place.  High quality dog and cat stuff; they also have birds (don't know anything about birds, so can't judge).  Very friendly staff member helped me fit a backpack for my dog, and when it was clear he needed a smaller size than they had in stock, she ordered it to arrive within the week.  Also, their grain-free selections are SIGNIFICANTLY cheaper for the quality than Petco, Petsmart etc.</text>

<Review>So my wife & I are always looking for a fantastic authentic American BBQ joint which is almost impossible to find these days. Well we've located our haven in C J's BBQ & Fish. The service was fantastic, the 2 gentlemen who worked there were very pleasant & the food was out of this world. I ordered the 2-way & chose pork ribs & chicken with mild sauce which comes with 2 sides as well (we both ordered fries & BBQ baked beans) for $21. My wife ordered the small catfish nuggets which was $14. Now I know the prices may seem high to some (who don't usually frequent BBQ establishments) but it's really not considering we both had enough left over for an entire 2nd meal. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who is in search of authentic high quality food. Next time we go we plan to try the peach cobbler & some cake. (Oh & almost forgot, we also ordered 3 hushpuppies for $1 & they were extraordinary as well. We were extremely pleased).<//Review>< pictures>

Definitely a backyard BBQ ribs, pork and chicken making place. Great ribs. My plate with a coke cost me $18. It was the regular plate and it's a good portion. Sadly enough the flies don't help the ambiance. Next time I'll do takeout.<//review>

< Review>
This place is right outside of Travis AFB. It looks kinda seedy, maybe not totally kept up on both the inside and outside, but wow. The food is definitely worth it, some of the best bbq I've had in a while. Not overly cheap, but the portion sizes are GENEROUS, and absolutely delicious. You can tell that they take pride in their food, and I'll definitely be going back.<//Review>

When first coming in we were automatically told there is 1 hr 45 min wait for ribs, over an 1 hr wait for ribs and 30 min wait for chicken. That was at 3:30. Decided to order chicken (which I was told is frozen so that’s why it takes 30min) and waited over an hr....for FRIED chicken wings! I rode past this place plenty of times and wanted to try but don’t waste your time because they will surely waste yours!< /Text>

<Review>I go fork the pork ribs and I get the spiciest bbq sauce. They are incredible. Super soft, tender, and smokey. I wouldn't know where to go to find any that taste better or if that's even possible. They're like candy to me. Don't play yourself, get them ribs at CJs. You won't be disappointed.<//Review>< Pics>

The food is alright but the customer service is horrible, those sisters are rude. Greet your customers don't stand there with a funny look on your face. Also the prices keep going up which I understand, but can we get a portion for what we pay for. I guess my friends & I drove from Sacramento to get a stare down, we must be cute.<//review>

This company provides service to our apartment community laundry rooms in Clarksville IN.  We have had equipment not working since March 22, 2021 and after numerous requests for service have still not had a repair person appear to fix the problem.  Many unhappy residents.  Today is April 1, 2021 and this is NOT an April Fool's Joke.< /text>

<rate>1< /rate><Text>If I could rate it a negative five, I would. STAY AWAY from this terrible company. I’ve been requesting service for FOUR MONTHS, with no response, technician, or solution. The only thing their customer service employees can do is “elevate” your request to....I don’t know where.

Meanwhile, the damaged unit has been full of four-month old water. I’ve resorted to writing to the CEO, CFO, and Chairman of the Board in order to seek resolution.

Awful, awful company with very little to no integrity.<//Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO0NMaH0Mzconzb8GbHWvOPsJnXKpeHHNX3ziV9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOQU1WB3DP1WjBUl7-4hMlxJMbIzUPTPBxubszr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNBCvjJVKQi2ZFVNjbTuFh2dmZ0J1qy-HASwleP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< response>

<Text>This company's machine always breaks. You literally have to swipe your card multiple times and charged you for it. When you emailed them for a refund they acted like they will help you. Then waited for a month for the refund and nothing happens. They don't do anything but to take customers money.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Rudest customer service experience I've ever dealt with. They wont give refunds at all. Just credit towards another card. Even if you choose not to use the machines anymore or move out. Too bad,  it's gone. Customee service reps are rude. They dont care about the customers at all. They just want to get paid and go home. They're all in the wrong business.< /review>

Wr live at the Tara Woods Apartments in Canoga Park and the washers we have are not good neither is the company’s customer service department.
My washer has been on the spin cycle for 16 minutes and has not stopped on the rinse cycle; needles to say the clothes will still have soap when I get them out 😡

Also, I had emailed them for a refund but the answer I kept getting is that I needed service?!

We have 9 washers and 3 are out🤦🏻‍♀️< /review>

I am a property manager. I often find myself calling this company to come and repair their units they refuse to repair or replace several broken old units.
I am down to only one functional laundry machine (in a 36 unit complex)that often takes more than 175 so another words it’s ripping off the tenants I am very disappointed that we have them in our property, and I wish that they would listen to our complaint to get everything fixed in a timely manner I would love for someone from corporate office to get back to me if they would like to keep our business with them<//text>

I don't usually leave reviews but I had to in order to tell people how awful the service is for this company.  I am a landlord of a building, there are 52 units and 75 people here, with one washer and dryer.  The machines break down semi frequently.  Normally a tech will come out and fix it somewhat quickly (usually within a week).  But, at this time my washer broke down (agitator doesn't work), and a few days later the dryer stopped working (not drying properly).  it has officially been over a month since I have been calling (literally dozens of times) and every time I talk to someone they mark it as a priority and put an order in, but tech shows up.  I am very disappointed and frustrated with the lack of information and the lack of communication within their own department.  people planning on using them beware.<//review>

<Review>We are so tired of this company!  They provide the machines in our building and haven't fixed a washer in almost a month - we only have two!  Our landlord is literally leaving pleading notes from them on the machines.  The quarter boxes regularly fail, jam or eat our money.  This is a case of "you had one job!"  You provide machines - if one is broke, you fix it.  Immediately!<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<Review>Worst company! Nobody answers the phone or requests for service so if your units have any problems you and your tenants are screwed. They keep almost 100% of money so least they can do is provide adequate service.

So when you leave an apartment complex and you have money on your laundry card "WASH" is supposed to reimburse you when you send in the card. Don't believe it, you will never see your money. Better to sell it to someone on the complex or just resolve that you will never see your money again. I sent a letter with the cards to them  (I photocopied all the cards). I didn't hear anything for 6 months. So I called. No record of my letter or cards. So they opened a ticket and I never heard back. That was almost 2 years ago. Apparently I donated to their business without my consent. Avoid them. Though I will say the person I spoke to on the phone the second time and opened a ticket was nice - probably cause she knew this company rips people off and I will never see my money.< /text>

WORST service! The people that answer the phone are kind, but there is zero follow through. We had a tank full of dirty water for 3 weeks.  The straw that broke the camels back was scheduling a guy whom it was his DAY OFF. They entered my number for him to call and he yelled at me that he wasn't suppose to talk to me! Yelled at a customer. LOL I idid not ever call the actual tech,  the company gave him my number. They need to figure a chain of command out. I called 6 times and still no fixed washer - this is on top of my property manager calling for 2 weeks straight.< /review>

<text>Not surprised to see their 2.5 stars rating. I called exactly 31 days ago and still, no service technician came out to fix the dryer. I have called them at least once a week and got the same answer each time, " We will escalate your ticket". They must have a lot of customers to not care if they lose a few. No follow up and customer service is non-existent!<//text>< Pictures>

<Text>For ONE WERK, I have been promised that a technician will be here in 1-2 days. STILL, no one here. WORST company ever....and this is affecting my income which is from a 6-unit apartment building. My tenants are furious. I have begged and pleaded with this terrible company to come fix my washer. DON’T USE THEM...They have ruined my reputation as an apartment owner.</Text>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Horrible service and machines. They have been out 3x in the last 6 months to "fix" the washer. They refuse to replace it. Still the same issue: final spin not working. Therefore, have to run the dryer twice: extra $1.25 every load!! "Hector" laughed at me when I said they needed to replace it, and that I would report them. I have reported them to the BBB, and to Bureau of Household Goods and Services (CA). I recommend everybody do the same. These guys are absolute scammers!!</Review><Response>{'time': 1569260398695, 'text': 'Hi Travis, we appreciate you reaching out and want to make sure we can get this addressed.

<text>Hello Everyone, thought I should share my experience with you all. If you own a privet property or are a manager of an apartment or commercial  property that holds laundry facility on site you must know. These company has been servicing us for over ten years, for the last 12 months there are so many problems with their services department and services. We have repeatedly reported about the machine maintenance issues and called to follow up with our requests however they continuously delay to maintain the machines and clam that it was maintained and completed. We have also reported to get the machines deep cleaning as its is needed for sanitary conditions. Yet we still have the same machines not working and not clean condition for over a month. As we all know, providing clean and working machines for your business and properties are priority for our residents and customers. Companies that do not provide services as required may cause negative impact to our residential properties and businesses. We value our relationship with our vendors and it is such matters that may otherwise cause termination of contract.
At this time we are considering to changes the company due to their over all poorly performance with maintenance services.< /text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>{'time': 1549484153943, 'text': 'Hi Ruzanna, we apologize for the lack of service you have experienced at your property.

<Review>I've been with Wash for year. I finally had enough and going to cancel the service. Every time there's an issue, they send a technician for the 'unknown' time: "In the next few days...".

The technician leaves a note and walks away. They don't return calls. They don't even email you to let you know what the problem is and when they'll fix it... so as of now, like many times before, i'm stuck with a broken machine. Their reps are incompetent. Terrible service.

- To answer the company response to this review: I already called 4 times.  last two times, talked to Patricia and Scarlet. I always hear the same mantra: "We'll call you back...". and I never hear back... this company is fraud. I had enough. going to cancel the service.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><response>{'time': 1567697814950, 'text': 'Hi Elad, we apologize for the delays in getting the machines serviced at your property and hope you allow us an opportunity to get this resolved.

Actual rating 0.  Same machines always broken.. they charge you to obtain a blank card.  Customer service horrendous.Have old laundry cards that were obtained before "PinMate system" and they will not work despite having balance of $15.50.. They do not post instructions how to get a rinse cycle for your laundry ( neighbor explained select HEAVY for stain type, after 17 min a light comes on above rinse cycle.. no other setting).  Consider local coin op..
P.sS. WASH Co.  I would like my $15.50 back..without having to purchase a PIN code< /Review>

I see that a lot of people seem to have had bad experiences with this company.  For what it is worth, I have been familiar with them for nearly 10 years, and have been impressed with their service.

My first experience with Web (now WASH) was in a small, 8 unit apartment in Long Beach.  I only had to call for repair once, and a technician was out the next day to fix it.  The only 'negative' about that experience was that they listed my contact number as the maintenance number for the property, so I got a couple of calls from them when a technician was dispatched and needed to be let in.  I explained to them that I was a tenant and they took my number out of their system.

I have called them half a dozen times since moving to a large apartment complex (over 100 units) here in Costa Mesa.  Every time they have dispatched a technician who has fixed the problem in less than 48 hours.  That might sound like a big deal, but each of the laundry rooms here has 3 washers and 3 dryers.  While having one unit down is a drag, it is not a show stopper.

They have an 800 number so all calls are free.  They put asset tags on all of their machines so they know exactly what machine you are calling about when you call.

The only negative that I would put down for them is that their card / cash machines are SUPER sensitive.  I suppose I understand because they want to cut down on fraud, but it gets frustrating when the machine spits out perfectly good, brand new, crisp clean bills.  It would be nice if they could dial down the sensitivity on the bill readers just a little bit.</Text>

Called to ask why their $2 wash cycle deducts $8 from my account. They told me that it is only to ensure payment and that the amount not spent out of the $8 will be returned and deposited back into the account in 2-3 days. I've been using these laundry machines for about a year. I've never seen a credit to my account from them ever before in my life. They either keep the entire $8, or they're off placing market bets with your money in the 2-3 days they're holding your money. This company is such a rip off to hard working tenants.<//Text>

<review>Horrible company to deal with. Corporate will not transfer calls to someone that has the power to listen and follow up. At our property the last time they came by to collect the money was March of 2018. We are in June of 2019. They do not communicate with the properties if there are issues. Processes are not in place when machines haven't had any money to the proper people. You would figure corporate would want to know if there machines have not collected anything for over an year...</review>< Pictures>

Their machines are faulty and refunds piss poor. I wasted over an hour and won’t be refunded for detergent. A really customer service poor company making a quick buck.

The company also has mandatory minimums for loading your card but won't refund any remaining balance "according to company policy. Go use the rest at another WASH enabled facility." Sounds torturous.

However after filing a complaint with San Jose BBB, Wash is issuing a refund. I urge ANYONE with a complaint to file. This company will have no choice but to actually think about customer service instead of corporate policies that line their pockets.

Any property considering Wash I urge you to find other solutions that better cater to your tenants.

UPDATE
You'll notice Wash's go-to in responding to this thread is to try to resolve this out of view with customer service representatives. What these representatives are actually able to do. Save your time and file with the Better Business Bureau of San Jose under Wash Multifamily Laundry Systems.

To prospective properties considering Wash's services with your own customers, carefully review that BBB page too.<//review>

I used one of the WASH dryers at the laundry room in the complex where I just moved into and it damaged all my new sheets and towels, there are stains and small holes everywhere.
Me and my partner calculated at least $100 in damages, as most of the stuff was being washed for the first or second time, and they offered us 7 dollars to rewash everything. When we said we would not take it, we were told that someone would contact us in two days to schedule a visit to look at out stuff.
We have called them five times. It has been two weeks and nothing. We can't even rewash out stuff until someone comes here.
The worst customer service experience yet.< /text>

<Text>Overall the washer and dryer machines are in good conditions. I never had an issue with them working. I do have to run them before I use them though because my bedding was bleached once and I can definitely say that i have never used bleach when washing my linens. The only other thing that i could complain about is people leaving hair in the washer machines. Other than that, I've had a great experience with the machines.</Text></record>

<Name>Diamond Heights Village</Name><Review>I have called their so called 'service line' multiple times over the same faulty equipment (washer) at our condo complex in Diamond Heights - San Francisco.  They never follow up, never call back - just outright disregard or accountability.  Last week I fell down flat on my back because their  ancient washer equipment flooded our laundry room.  I called it in same day and a week later, had the same thing happen again only worse this time - with a good 3 inches of water plus pouring out of the washer and running through the walls into our garage.  Called them asking what happened.  The agent said, oh yes, this machine has been called in many times (3 by myself) plus others.  Told me that someone would call me first thing Monday.  By 1 PM no one of course has bothered.  If you are considering using their service and have a choice AVOID AVOID AVOID.  If I could give them a ZERO or a NEGATIVE number, I definitely would.  Absolute WORST!< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< rate>

This company has been very unprofessional. One of the dryers I used damaged my $100 comforter back in November. They sent a technician out to look at the damage the same week, I still have not heard anything back regarding my reimbursement for damaged item. I have called pretty much every week since the incident and every week, they tell me "someone" will give me a call. I am so disappointed that my apartment complex uses this company.</Text>

The worst customer service ever, while using old equipment and charge you a lot of money for machine and dryer that need to be fixed every two weeks.

No stars, worse residential laundry systems I have ever seen. Every time I use these machines in my complex their seems to always be an issue. I am in Las Vegas and like the apartment I live in except for their use of this Wash/ Laundry Systems Service. I don't get a refund as requested and just a waste of time to call them. I am simply going to have to use the facility 2 blocks from my apartment when I can just use the laundry facility right next door to mine if these machines worked!!!< /text>

WASH provides the washing and drying machines at my college dorm, and I've never had a problem using them. The washing machines have load sizes options and water temperature options, so you can wash your delicate clothing in cold water if you don't want them to shrink. It usually takes less than half an hour to wash your clothes. The drying machines have the same type of settings, even letting you dry your clothes in low heat, but it can take longer than an hour if you do so. Like I said, I've never had a problem with machines not working correctly, or my clothes needing more time in either the washer or driver. One cycle has always been enough. Overall, WASH offers an easy to understand product that covers all your needs.<//Review>

<Text>Dont waste your time with doing business with Wash.  David Jackson, representative for the region, doesn't follow up, doesn't have a clue who I am or where we are in the process when I do finally reach him.  The Wash  contracts department is a black hole. I call and call and try to talk to the supervisor of David Jackson, a guy named Steven and get no response from him.

Wow!  Just saw the Wash reviews on Yelp.  How is this company in business at all still and wasting our time.< /Text>< name>

<Review>ATTN Building Owners and Managers! Don't use this company! Look elsewhere! Even handwashing each of my 1000s of articles of clothing sounds more appealing than having to deal with the incompetence of this company. I've lived in my apartment building for almost 2 years, and on any given day, at least one of the two washers/dryers (provided for 40+ apartment units, which is bizarre) is broken down. The dryers won't heat, so you'll end up having to pay for multiple cycles in the hopes that your clothes will come out AT LEAST DAMP. The washers won't take quarters, or you'll open the lid to find a nice murky swamp at the bottom, just to keep things interesting and fill the laundry room with a questionable aroma.
Calling in a maintenance request is guaranteed to take a nice chunk of time out of your day, since you'll be on hold for at least 20 minutes.
Theyll put in an order to have a guy come in sometime in the next decade. The guy will come and stick a band-aid on the gushing wound that is this company, everything will appear to be fixed, only to result in yet another malfunctioning machine. And the cycle continues (no pun intended). This company is truly not worth the headache that it brings. Do yourself and your tenants a favor and look elsewhere!<//Review>< pics>

I live in an apartment complex. We use to have the top loading washer for year. Yes it would break down once in a while due to others packing in too much laundry in the washer, but that washer worked well. Two months ago they replaced the washer with an energy efficiency front loader. That darn washer broke down 3 times. The last time they came out to fix it and it still isn't fixed. All three times it took over a week to fix. God knows how long it's going to be this time. I wouldn't complain the f I had a car and the money to go to the laundromat, but I don't and don't have the energy to walk half a mile with a shopping cart going uphill to the laundromat. I currently have approximately 6-8 loads of laundry to clean. GRRRR!!!!!
Dec. 20 2018. I called again to check on the service man who was supposed to be at the apartment where I live to fix the washer. They told me there was no request for service. So I placed another request. Let's see what happens.
Dec. 20 2018. Instead of y service man coming out to check the machine, he called me. He asked if anyone has removed the coins from the box. I replied I don't know. He said he thinks that's what the problem is. He thinks? Oiy!
Update- Found out the problem. When they installed the new washer and dryer, they did not give the landlord the keys to the coin box. 😕 After another week, the machine was up and running.  Why did this take so long? Why wasn't the keys given to the landlord or one of the tenants at time of installation?? 😕☹️🤔<//text>

Ever since you bought out Web Laundry Service Your Service Has been very slow..A call was made this Sunday regarding washing machine leaking and not working.. My tenant made the call as I was out of town..There was supposed to be a technician there Tuesday....Today is Wednesday and still no one has shown up...
I called today (Wednesday) and the young lady answering could not give me a date as to when someone will be there? What kind of service is this?
I've had Web Laundry service for 25+ years with very fast repair service..Wash your service is totally unacceptable...will have to look for other company to service my buildings....< /review>

Very easy to use. There wasn't a million buttons there to confuse you and included instructions on the washer. I also liked that there was a time given until your wash/dry was done so that you're able to set a timer to come collect your laundry.</review>

I’ve been on hold
Over an hour to speak to a supervisor. The dryers in my unit has been broken down for almost five days. I pay almost $2000 in rent and one of my promises is a washer and dryer in unit. ALL THREE dryers are broken and someone quoted a 72 hour waiting period. It has now been almost 5 days and when i spoke to a customer service rep they said they didn’t have an estimated time or day that it would be fixed?? So I asked to speak to a supervisor to find someone who could help answer these questions, and i was quickly and rudely put on hold and that’s where I’ve been for over an hour. you guys suck.</text>

My experience has been that the washers and dryers are poorly maintained. My service requests go unanswered for too long if they even respond. I'll probably have to serve on our homeowners board again next election so I can get rid of them and go with a different company. **Note to Wash Laundry** Please don't bother to respond with a "were sorry" like I've seen on some other posts. Don't make excuses. Just try to do a better job responding to service requests and fix the machines properly.<//text>

<text>In Redondo Beach, the apartment complex I live in has WASH and the machines work well - whenever they break down they are fixed within 1-2 business days. They even have a mobile payment app so you don't have to go get quarters to do your laundry. This is really convenient and makes doing laundry on site much more appealing than having to spend time at a laundromat.<//text>< pics>

Very unpleasant experience, and would not recommend. Living on a property with leased WASH laundry machines,  which are 10+ years old, and often need repair that they will not replace.  And then in trying to cancel service and have them pick up these machines Has been a huge hassle which only confirms the decision to discontinue service.</Review>

Im in Los Gatos CA. WASH FORMERLY WEB LAUNDRY IS WORST SERVICE EVER. our machine broke on Wednesdays. Neighbor calked and Was assured machine would be fixed by Thursday. I then Called Thursday night because machine still filled with water and they apologized and said would make priority for service Friday. Friday neighbor called and service was rude to her saying they didn't know when machine would get fixed. I called again Saturday and they said they were really busy with service calls. So basically our machine has been filled with old water for 5 days now. Oh and BTW we complained the central spinner was split months ago and they never fixed it and only worse now so will probably start tearing clothes soon...now landlord came by today and called...this is 5 phone calls now. I will update if machine ever gets fixed.

After 7 days machine still broken and full of water. Can't even contact anymore through number on web pamphlet. And now I receive this response

Do not use this laundry service. They are a complete joke. You can call them when a machine is bad and they'll send you a check for the money but I've had the checks get returned unpaid and ended up with a $12 service charge. Customer service  is terrible too. Give these guys a hard pass.</text>

< Review>
Horrible company. The only washer in my four unit complex has been inoperable for over a month despite multiple services requests being placed both online and via phone. It took them two weeks to come out in response to the first online request I had placed, which was after neighbors had also placed several phone calls the week before. The person who came out from WASH put a sign on the machine saying a replacement was on order. It has been over three weeks since then and they have still not resolved the issue. All of the tenants in the building still have no way to do laundry. Their customer service represntatives says they will call you back, but don’t and they refuse to escalate the issue to a supervisor. I don’t understand how a company that’s sole business is to service washing and drying machines does not have multiple extra machines ready to replace broken down equipment. Completely ridiculous.

Update 12/14/17: Issue still unresolved. It has now been 24 days since the service tech put a note on the machine stating a replacement was on order. No word on progress from the company. Building completely without laundry for over a month and a half. Filed a complaint with BBB.<//Review>

They never wash or dry effectively, they price gouge you at every possible turn, and are always down.

I've never had a more terrible time doing anything than I have with laundry while at college. What an absolute, pathetic joke.< /review>< Resp>

<Review>I have lived in a Garden Grove complex for 23 years, and WASH/ WEB Service has been here as well. Their machines go down regularly, sometimes taking 2-3 days to repair them. They've consistently raised rates, (sometimes not notifying tenants), making it hard on tenants, as tenants tend to have a set amount of quarters at any time. They offer paying electronically through I-Phones, and that sometimes does not work. Their machines do not offer enough water to wash the clothing well, and they purposely set that up to be that way, offering to add more water for a greater fee. Now they want to raise rates again, claiming that they have "analyzed" the area, and that our "economically challenged" neighborhood  is in good economic shape, and that we are "under" market value. This is a form of marketing, and has the taste of "slum lord" management. The review: for the value and service they offer, they are out connection with reality, and seem to be focused upon high end profit, and do not provide good service. I do not recommend them, see the other list of low end reviews.</Review>< pictures>

I used WASH through my dorm's laundry service and I've had mostly good experiences with the system; however, there were about two times during the school year where my clothes were not wringed out completely during the spin cycle. Although this did occur, our facilities were quick to fix the problem. Both washer and dryer machines are simple to use!< /Text>

I have put in I don't know how many requests for refunds. Their machines just keep stealing money from me. Dryers that produce no heat. dryers where the buttons stick so they won't start but they still take your money. Buttons where you push the one with your laundry and it adds 45 minutes to the persons laundry above you. Im going broke just on the problems with there machines.< /Text>

Dyer vents have never  been cleaned probably since being installed. When calling the company its clear they don't care. I would encourage everyone to find other means of cleaning their clothes. It's not safe or sanitary.</Review>< Pictures>

<review>This company is horrid and without honor. It takes multiple calls to get anything done (like a repair). And they have most recently increased the pricing for the use of the dryer on our premises, without any notification and while almost doubling the price! On top of which, the "new" dryer doesn't even work properly!!! Having been stuck with this company for years in a lease agreement, the tenants look forward to saying adios. In meantime, I still await for the owner of this poorly run company to contact me and discuss what continues to be pure ridiculousness.< /review></record>

We had 3 sets of their machines -- we moved out of one, called them on January 4, 2018 to pick up their machines and had to leave a voicemail.  Mind you this was mid-morning -- no call back at all for 3 days.  Then we went online and did a pick-up request again -- 3 days with no call nor response to us via email even. Now it is the weekend so we call again on Monday leave a message -- finally reach someone on the following Friday (it has been 2 weeks that we had moved out mind you from the rental), and they can't pick them up till the following Friday.  Even though we documented everything, they still billed us for the time it took them to pick their machines!! Avoid at all costs!!</text>

Do not ever use this company. My tenants had no working washer for last 30 days and I still need to call the technician every other day from my work. I requested termination and their trick to give them 30 day notice. Lupe is never there and she is the only person I can talk to unfortunately. I absolutely do not advise with this company to save your life.<//review>

<rate>2< /rate><Review>Laundry washing machines are dirty & are not cleaned. I paid an extra $6.50 to clean 4 washers. I didn't want to have grease or stains transferred to my laundry. There is no sink or running water to use a pitcher & flush the soap,   bleach/non-chlorine bleach or fabric softener compartments. When I find a washer that is so clogged & dirty - I just try to find a cleaner one. Since the washers are so dirty; I have been considering purchasing a portable washer. Get it together & clean up your machines. Additionally, you may consider asking the property owner to install deep sinks. A Concerned Consumer.

Horrible machines, horrible service. I'd give zero stars if I could. They don't care that everytime their machines don't work we lose the money we put in.  If it happened only occasionally it would be no big deal but when it happens frequently it's not ok. They're stealing from us by not providing the service we paid for. I'm going to do my best to get the owner's to change service to a better company.</Text>

<Text>Not sure how they are still in business. Their machines are rarely in working condition. These semi-antique rusted apparatuses could be purchased at a yard sale for 17 bucks. Service requests go unattended to for weeks at a time. Speaking of service requests, after you are placed on hold for 15+ mintutes and forced to listen to the recording falsely claiming that their company and service are top notch and customer-oriented, you will then be connected to a customer service representative with a rather impudent tone. To complement the morose attitude, you can also expect useless responses to questions about exactly when the machines will be serviced. Property managers are better off providing buckets and clotheslines to their tenants, as this would be more useful and convenient than WASH’s lack of services.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>{'time': 1550622168702, 'text': 'Hi Elise, we sincerely apologize for your experience with WASH.

WASH is a pretty great company: From their customer service to what it is they do/offer, they meet (if not exceed) many standards I have for businesses like this. Despite what other reviews claim, I've never had issues with customer service, and can't relate to the negative reviews...</text>

Then all of a sudden, my profit split  check came in for $3.00- $4.00. I called. No one called me back. Sales rep will call me back. Never did so now this hassle and this review.   Why would i want to keep these machines?</text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Has anybody ever heard of the company @ Home Rentals?  Apparently they’re owned by this parent company.  I had rented a fridge through them and they continue to charge my credit card for a service I closed two months ago and I’ve never run into this problem before.  I’m pretty sure they took a deposit from me as well. They are also impossible to get a hold of... Would appreciate some help solving this!

2 stars because it was a nice fridge, but way overpriced for a rental service, especially with the customer support you receive... Glad it’s almost over!<//review>

<user_id>109528136177460659616<//user_id><Review>I use these machines at the Canyon Club Apartments in Oceanside. The company recently raised the prices to 2 dollars a wash. Highway robbery! Their service is TERRIBLE! the machines are in poor condition, some dryers do not dry as well as others, and the wash machines are smaller top load machines compared to the pricing at your average laundromat. I have routinely placed the "red tags" (which are no longer provided) to notify the company of recurrent issues with machines, and I have called their "customer service" to report  most common problems such as inoperable buttons for the load you wish to accomplish (which you only find one you have loaded the machine). I have spoken with the apartment managers who have stated their disgust with the company as well, but they were recently appeased with a new card machine that allows for an online re-fill of the card (when it works) which is un-accessible by residents after business hours. I do an average amount of laundry for two people and routinely pay 40 or more dollars a month (now 50). I have opted, out of principle, to boycott these machines, and drive to a laundromat - as have several other residents. This is shameful greediness in my opinion, and has little to do with the proprietors overhead. Just awful!</Review>< username>

I own multiple properties where we use WASH and compared to the rest of the industry, WASH does a great job at managing laundry rooms. Their equipment and service response times are MUCH better than other companies and they have a service app that allows you to scan machines for service. Machines get old and break down, but overall WASH is serving their customers well.<//review>

So I would say stay away from this company all they want to do is collect the money they don't do any preventive maintenance and have never cleaned the machines or dryers and are very slow to fix anything when they raise prices they messed something up with the machines and none of them would worked for days and  photos of the condition of the machines at my place<//text>

They try to be good to customers.  That's nice.

But the machines are soooooo bad.  These would have been considered crappy machines even in the 1970's.   Here we are in the age of computers and they give us the worst, pathetic excuses for washer and dryer I have ever seen.  Loud, vibrating, no imbalance shut off, grinding sounds, leaks, did i mention LOUD? motors and rumbling... Total junk machines.

Clothes come out clean, and dry.  That's good.  But in apartments these machines rattle the whole building. !

The company does respond to customer service requests.  They are good about that.<//text>

< Review>
***UPDATE**** it took 9 days, 7 phone calls and my superior at the management company to call our account manager directly at WASH to get this resolved by 4/11/18.  The owners replied to this review below giving me the same 1800 outsourced number to unhelpful people.  Now yesterday (5/7/2018) less than 1 month later, the 'add value' machine is not working again.

I highly advise against using this Wash Multifamily Laundry systems. We've had their machines installed at our apartment complex for less than a year.  7 days ago (on 4/2/2018) the "Add Value" machine quit working.  I called and they said a technician would come out in 1-2 business days.  In 2 days it was not repaired.  They said a technician would come out the following day.  2 days later still not fixed. I call again and they said they have 'escalated' my request and they'll try to get someone out there the next day.  I asked for a supervisor but none were available and they said they would try to follow up with me.  Still nothing the next day and I call back (this is my 4th call at this point).  I immediately ask for a supervisor and get one.  He was worthless.  He said that my ticket was escalated and that he would try to followup and try to get in touch with the local technician (the call center is outsourced).  I called again today (day 7) and spoke to another supervisor named Julius.  He gave me the same speech that he would try to follow up and try to contact the technician.  But in the end he was still not able to contact a technician, no one is assigned to fix the machine and tenants in my building still can't wash their laundry.  I would call the El Segundo location but unfortunately the 1800 number only rings to the outsourced call center in the Philippines.  DON'T USE THIS COMPANY!</Review>

Dear WASH.
We do not need your apologies or empty promises of premiere service. We need you to come FIX the washer that has been broken since before Xmas. My tenants have been unable to do laundry for weeks. Look up my account and send someone out tomorrow Friday Jan 18. Your guy didn’t show up the three times this week that we were told he would.
Thank you.< /Text>

<Review>This is the WORST laundry company I have ever worked with. I am a landlord and own multiple rental properties, I will be canceling service with WASH and used a different company in all of my properties. They never return phone calls or emails. I have been trying to upgrade my laundry units for over a month now even escalating up to management and they still do not return phone calls or emails and never come to service or upgrade. Horrible company! They will surely go out of business if they keep up this kind of service with landlords</Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

The washer breaks once a month at least.  It takes them on average 4 days to fix it. They can never tell you exactly when it'll be fixed.  Their customer service is pure garbage.  I'm writing this angry review after the 6th time this has happened.  Allegedly, there is a guaranteed 48 hour service time. (Lies)

Our entire complex is out of a washer too consistently to not do anything.  If you guys were the least bit apologetic or understanding people wouldn't be so mad.  ✌️<//text>

I have been using your company for many years on all my apartments but, if you don't get your act together FAST on these insane wait times on your office phones, (I'm on hold as I write this for 20 minutes) I'll go back to Dadson or All Valley Washer. GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER!!!<//Review>

<text>They are one of the worst companies that I have ever used. They take your money and when you call to get it back they won’t give it to you. Claim to charge 1.25 for a load of laundry with an 8 dollar “deposit” that is supposed to be given back after a few hours. They never give it back. And do not give it back when you call them. This is a fraudulent company do not use them.</text></record>

I’m currently living in an apartment complex where somebody broke into the only card machine to load our wash laundry cards because they were trying to take out the cash box. I called them because I wanted to see how long it was going to take before they fixed it they are telling the complex managers and they told me 7 to 10 days mind you there are many residents in here who do not have a washer and dryer so we’re supposed to just wait 7 to 10 days to do our laundry, and it takes them a month to come out and fix A washer or dryer it is absolutely ridiculous, very inconvenient for many residents in here that do not have a washer and dryer you need to be out here by the end of Friday and put a new card machine and maybe install some security cameras so you can see who busted that machine open!!! Northcreek apartments in Fresno thank you<//Text>

Worst service ever. They withhold payments 2-3 months and do not mail the commission checks after we call. But get through to them is imposibnle so they put u on hold for houses untitled u quit eating. Do not lease their equipment for your apartment units. Go someware else !!!!!!</Review>

There should be ZERO stars rating. Clothing locked in washer for 48 hours and they couldn't get a technician out to fix the problem in a timely manner. Are the technicians based in another state? Customer service rep on phone barely speaks English. I guess it's all out sourced, except for when they come to scrape up the coins out the machines. This is a crappy company and they need to be put out of business. They don't give a damn about the people they are claiming to serve.< /Review>

<review>The company does not want to actually help the customer, they hope your card is bad so you have to buy a new one, with the only way to get any refund is to mail them

Side note, if there is a quick and painless manner in which to receive a reimbursement for money i now cant use, i am more than willing to change my review to higher<//review>< pictures>

Wash MultiFamily Laundry Systems recently took over for Coin-O-Matic, where I live in Miami, FL. For the last two days, 7-09-18 and 7-10-18, Wash MultiFamily has been ‘dropping my calls’ or their voicemail menu sends me to a ‘full inbox’, preventing me from leaving a message for service.  My initial call for service was 5 days ago.  Just like Coin-O-Matic, Wash MultiFamily makes their customers use ‘very old’ machines that are prone to break several times per month. Unfortunately, Wash MultiFamily responds to service requests at my building even ‘more slowly’ than Coin-O-Matic did, and now I cannot even reach them by phone to request service.  This company needs to “get its act together”sooner, rather than later, because everyone at my 20-unit building is now taking their laundry to a laundromat instead of using the machines at the building.< /text>

I use their washers at my apartment complex in Oceanside.  They suck!!  The service is HORRIBLE and they just raised their per wash price AGAIN.  According to SDG&E, the average cost to wash a load of clothes is 51 cents.  Why does this company charge $2.00??  Going to a local laundromat and paying half that is now much more worthwhile.  Hopefully ALL of my neighbors will start doing the same!<//Text>

The 5 stars is for the customer service only. The machines seem to breakdown lots, I don't know if it's from abuse or just bad equipment although I haven't witnessed any abuse of the machines. The price is a little higher than what I care to pay and is higher than most outside laundry mats I've been to. I live in San Diego.< /review>

In 01/2018 I sent WASH MLS my laundry card with error #06 and wrote its balance was about $25.
In 02/2018 I called and WASH MLS customer service politely said they were running behind in processing lots of cases.
In 03/2018 WASH MLS sent me a new card with balance $25.
Albeit taking a while, WASH MLS did take my word for the balance and processed my claim as I had hoped for.<//review>

They charge more than then what is posted on the on their machines claiming it's a deposit. You can use this "deposit" on the machines for the next three hours. I used less than the "deposit" they took and they did not refund the money that was not used. When I called customer service they could not provide records or proof of anything. My bank told me that they where not putting the left over money back into my account. I do not understand why they need a deposit for such a small transaction and cannot charge by use. Seems like an extremely shady business.

EDIT: I did contact the company by phone and they gave me multiple forms to fill out and fax or mail in to receive my $1.25. They where extremely unapologetic and wanted me off the phone as soon as possible.</review>

<Review>This is without a doubt the worst laundry company out there. Go other places, I beg you! They've stolen my money on more than one occasion. We have them here at university and the machines always break down and "load" your card with money but then it says there was a mistake and doesn't put it on the card. After waiting for 45min on the phone, found that I have to mail the card and reciept with a note detailing what happened. Excuse me, but I'm just a poor college student with no funds nor any time. Terrible service. These guys suck<//Review>< rate>

Been waiting almost 9 days for service ,keep getting told he's on his way for the last 4 days. Liars. Just get the runaround. No supervisor available...I would lodge a complaint to the company but I can't get hold of anyone who cares. To the laundry I and all the other tenants are going.  Bad customer service<//review>

<Text>I had 3 washers break down on me. Apparently they were “fixed” today because the 2 that broke down on me had a note that was left by the technician saying they were good to go. First of all, one of the washer wouldnt let me start it after i put in my quarters so it ate my quarters. I called to get my quarters back and they are refunding me for that. Then, 2 other ones just shut off on me and left me with my clothes soaked. Meaning the washer was filled with water and my clothes were left completely wet. I then had to take my clothes out, put them in bags all wet and I decided to go to a public laundry place where its efficient to wash. Very bad quality on laundry machines. Im going to have to talk to the manager of my complex to get a different company because this one isn’t doing the job.</Text><user>102268251908100627004</user>< Rating>

<date>1544993198504<//date><Rating>2</Rating><Review>According to their website (Home page -> Service Request -> Residents ->  Refund Request): "For a card system refund or for a defective card, please see your property manager for a refund kit or call [their number]."

I've been in contact with Wash Multifamily Laundry Systems for 3 months and each time I ask for an update on my refund for the remaining balance on my laundry card, they keep saying that the check has been sent and to allow 5-10 business days for arrival. Then finally, today when I called again for an update, the representative informs me that a refund is not possible and that I am to request the refund directly from my property manager. I wonder why their website says otherwise and why it took 3 months for me to receive this type of response.

Similar to what other reviewers have said here...I'd suggest you keep the card and sell it to your fellow neighbors instead. Another suggestion is to dispute the original charge with your credit card service company. I contacted my credit card service company and submitted a dispute. A few days later, I received a response that the dispute was resolved and I wouldn't be charged. Then, finally, a couple days after that, I received the reimbursement via mail directly from Wash.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>{'time': 1545072427328, 'text': 'Hi Perry, we are sorry to hear about your recent experience with WASH.

<Review>This company provides the machines at the complex where I live.  You can only use your own credit/debit card and when you do, they consistently capture much more money than your swipe needed.  I used $1.25 to dry a load of clothes and it took $14.75 from my account.  That was a week ago and I still have yet to get it back in my account, however they did process the actual $1.25 that I really used.  I have had this happen several times in the 6 months since living here.  No where on any machine does it state it will take more than you need.  The dryers have taken payment and then not worked on several occasions as well. When I called customer service they told me they could not answer why the machine did this because they were just a CSR who takes calls for technicians.  I would rather lug my clothes to the coin laundry down the street than be robbed by incompetent people every time I need to do laundry.< /Review></record>

< Review>
A machine breaks at least once a week. But, my main reason for this review is their thieves. I have had 4 different cards with balances on them zero out for no apparent reason. I had emailed them just to let them know and finally after the 4th time I called thinking i would get a refund of some sort. Instead i got a nasty woman saying it has never happened and they will send a tech out. When I know for a fact from my leasing office it has happened to other tenants. Horrible customer service and really bad for business.<//Review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><review>As a college student I live on-campus in my school's dormitory (CSU, Long Beach). In my first year at school the machines operated normally. In my second year at school, both of our dryers broke. For a little over a week students in my building have been calling to speak to representatives of our laundry service (WASH) to have them fixed/get maintenance performed. Students, including myself, have reported the dryers broken in that time online as well. On the Monday of this week (4/17) someone was sent to do repairs. Today (Thursday 4/20) they are still broken. There are over 25 people living in this building, and they depend on the washers and dryers provided by your company to wash their clothes and work uniforms. I'm disappointed in WASH's customer service and maintenance of their products and unfortunately will have to report this problem of malfunctioning/inoperable dryer's to your phone representatives and online reporting service. Although I no longer expect it, I hope that your company can find someone to resolve this issue.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

<review>Seriously I thought I would've learned my lesson after the 3rd time these machines gave me problems. My clothes are literally wet, the machine did not work at all. The last two times the machine wouldnt let me open the door cause it was stuck, and the first time the machine also did not dry my kids school clothes. Instead of raising the prices maybe you should look into fixing these machines. I will not be using these machines at all and I will make sure no one in my family makes the same mistake. Ill be taking my business else where along with giving a heads up to all the other residents. Reports have been made and it takes weeks to get it resolved.  A big red flag would be the reviews posted for this company.</review><pics>None<//pics><Response>{'time': 1499099721727, 'text': "Hi Zoe, sorry to hear you have been experiencing issues with WASH.

Mr. Chad G.  I see a number of apologies where you responded on a number of negative reviews for the company.  However the negative reviews are still being submitted. I had nothing positive experiences with the company except for today.  Our POS machine has been down for 3 weeks. Not a big deal to me, I thought. I figured that I could simply call the company and ask for the location of the nearest POS machine where I may be able  to reload my card.  Was I surprised when I was informed that they didn't have that information.  So I thought that since I called in to report the machine, and because I didn't know the exact address that was on file for the machine, the customer service agent back then had thought I was calling from another apartment complex, so I asked the representative that i was speaking with today if he could just give me the address to the other apartment complex, and i gave him the name of the complex,  so that I could reload my card. He pretty much told me "NO", by the way, his name was Frank.. I asked him what the issue was with him just providing me with an address to reload my card, he simply told me that I need to hang up the phone.  I asked him for a Supervisor, he stated that the supervisor would give me the same information and that a supervisor wasn't available and I would have to call  back tomorrow, I then asked him if there was another representative available, and he told me that if I wanted to speak to someone else then i needed to call back.  In which I hung up and called back, and again, I reached Frank.  I hung up. Looked up this company online ..I saw the MANY negative reviews, most of them being about out of order machines, but to my surprise i also saw information stating that I could simply reload my card online or with my smartphone...hmmmm why wasn't that information provided to me by Frank..So I called back, and yes Frank answered the phone. so I asked him about adding money to my card online or by smartphone. he simply stated that I couldn' do that..But's its ok..if you all don't want the money i need to spend on laundry, and I have  a nice sized family, I won't continue to, what seems to me, beg you for the information that I need to be able to spend it with you. I'll simply go to the laundry mat. THANKS FOR NOTHING!!  ****The only reason I gave one star is because I wouldn't be able to post without selecting it....<//text>

Awful. No matter how many times we ask for them to fix our washing machine, it's still broken and continually floods our laundry room. In the past year, we've called them to fix the washer probably 6 times? & Our dryer makes our clothes smell really bad. This company literally just sucks. They say they're going to show up in "1-2 business day," but never do and tell our landlord that the issue is fixed. And one day later, it floods the laundry room again.

Just lazy and poor business practice.<//Text>

As a property owner this company is horrid.  Slow to service, slow to pay owners and it is a hassle dealing with tenants who are always loosing money on these machines thinking I keep it (I don't obviously -- WASH does).  Run the other way apartment owners.<//Text>

EVERYONE IS DISSATISFIED AND WANTS THEM REPLACED BY ANOTHER SERVICE COMPANY.
our experiences.
1. over 1'2 of their washing machines are always broken and need constantly repair.
2. the washing machines have NEVER been repaired in less than a month.
3. because of the broken washing machines go unattended, the standing water smells like a sewer...imagine trying to do laundry in a small room that smells like a sewer.
4. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER - they have a call center in Central America where English is a second language spoken poorly with only limited comprehension of english vocabulary.
5. hold times always over 30 minutes.
6. there are no supervisors / managers in customer service so you cant escalate a problem. you are stuck with whomever answers the phone.
7. i have asked multiple times for an american to return my call. it has NEVER HAPPENED.

3 of the 5 machines in my building have been broken for over 3 weeks. initially, i reported the problem and asked for a refund. they sent me a BAD LAUNDRY CARD THAT DIDN'T WORK IN THEiR MACHINES. customer service said i have to mail the bad card to prove i am not lying. then, they will send me a new card. its a slap in the face they think i would lie for $7.

please NEVER use this company or you will be sorry you did.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Ever since WASH Multifamily took over the account for the 3 buildings I manage, service has gone "down the drain."  They raised prices, their machines break down every other month, their customer service reps are no help whatsoever, and I have yet to hear back from my regional manager for whom I have left upteen messages for.<//Review>

Having big problems with timely follow through on service calls.  I have 20 machines that are old and need replacement.   Always told that we must wait 1-2 days for service then... it takes 3-6 days for a tech to show up.   Tenants hate this company and are pleading with us to change vendors.   Have been using them since early founding as Webb and am now about ready to find someone else.   It is a shame.. they have gone down hill SO BAD!!< /Text>

They only have a couple customer service agents when they have more than 20 calls in queue, machines won't get fixed properly when service calls are placed, and the majority of the people don't know how to use the machines correctly, that's why the laundry machines are always out of order.< /text>

Their machines are junk and their service is terrible. From the day they were installed, the pay with phone system hasn't worked.

After multiple calls, the machines still don't work.

Pure junk!< /Text>

Worst service ever. They just started in our building and they screwed everybody. They charge you $8 every time you pass your credit card and you have to wait ( I still waiting) more than 15 business days for your refund by mail!!!. No wonder why this company has only one star everywhere!!< /Review>

I have a regular service person (Christian) who is awesome. He comes in and does his business. He makes sure to leave my gates all the way he finds them (closed and secure) each and every time he comes. I asked him to make sure he takes care of this due to my dog (my best friend) and I have never had to remind him since. Christian does a great job for Orkin. Please give him props because good help is hard to find. The man is on time, efficient and courteous. No bugs means a job well done. They give you notice as to when they will arrive for the service and then they show up and do a great job.

<Text>I received professional, pleasant, and knowledgeable service from the time I scheduled the appointment, to the day of the service. I was especially pleased with Angel, the service provider. He had a happy disposition, was detail oriented, respectful, listened, and was very considerate. It is refreshing to interact with such a congenial person. (This service was for my dad's home)

Angel's service sold me on Orkin so much that I am scheduling an Orkin provider for my home in Northern California.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><response>{'time': 1618255382256, 'text': 'Thank you for taking the time and giving us a five star rating.

I have used Orkin for about 8 months now and they have been nothing short of amazing. Their workers are very courteous and professional. They not only spray but work to provide cleanliness from unsightly webs and supply you with preventative measures to ensure that you stay pest free between visits. And if you do have a problem between visit, they are only one call away and will tend to it in a very timely manner. The services has been exceptional with the two representatives they have sent to my residence. I feel safe, taken care of, and they make sure that you are satisfied with their service before they leave. Even with the mask on, you can still tell that it's service with a smile.

Highly recommended.<//Text>

<Review>The technician that comes to do the service is great. The billing department is not great. I've been over charged, double charged and not charged at all. I have auto bill pay so I don't have to be bothered. With multiple billing errors I am bothered. I don't have time for it. Get your billing department together. Nick, the technician, is the only reason why I'm considering using them for any services at all.  As of right now I have cancelled my services.</Review><UserId.>102705912520348960759<//UserId.><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Chris is kind, thoughtful, professional, and rational in his approach.  I appreciate that he considers the cost and my budget rather than just trying to get as much money from me as he can.  This creates a customer-company relationship that I want to continue in order to protect my home from termites.  I will continue to use Orkin's services.< /review>

<rate>5<//rate><Review>We purchased another home in a rural area with Orchard of fruit trees that came with multiple issues! (Rodents, cocker roaches, mice, spider and silver fish.) I have phobea of insects and small undesirable creatures! I can finally be at ease and rest!

Orkin kept us on track with scheduling or as needed. There were quite a few times in between quarterly visits we needed them to come out!!! The customer service was always excellent and professional. They answered all my questions and scheduled appointment without delays as needed.  (THANK YOU)

Our tech Gabriel was ALWAYS friendly, easy going and professional. Great with my dogs! Whenever, I asked him questions he was more than happy to assist me and took his time to make sure all the areas were treated. 😊Unfortunately, he will be leaving to relocate in a different city. Hopefully, the new tech will continue the same excellent service.

Thank you,

We have used their services for approx 2 years- they bought out the local company we originally signed up with And everything was fine. Scheduling was easy and all that. However, after our annual inspection a few things needed to be addressed. Not surprising as we live in Southern California!

We will NEVER do business with Orkin again. The inspector was more interested in up selling services than providing good customer service and listening to our needs around our timing and availability. I was going to schedule the needed maintenance services but said I would do so after we returned from out of town and once I had a firm grasp on our families upcoming schedule. The sales rep was less than professional and felt like a typical used car salesman. After receiving multiple emails from the sales rep - almost daily- I asked that he stop emailing me - I actually had to call Orkin and speak with his manager and ask that he stop emailing me.

Regarding pricing- I am not surprised that when I had a local pest control company inspect our home and quote us services needed it came in 62% LESS THAN the PRICE Orkin quoted.  Yes, for the sales services. Shame on you Orkin for your pricing strategy. Please don’t give this company your business.< /text>

No response after multiple calls. Not answering their phones. We are long-time customers. The ants keep advancing.
(UPDATE): 2 days later, this AM tried again, with no responses received to the messages I left.  Made 2 calls, each time was on hold for 20 minutes (gave up after the first call) for a total of 40 minutes on hold.  Finally got somebody on the phone.  Also phone reception was very garbled, who knows if the fires are to blame.  Later I saw a message on our house answering machine from around the time I was calling, not the cell phone number I left.  Rep was nice but apparently the local branch phone number is a well kept secret not appearing on Google or on our bills or anywhere and all calls go through the central system.  Get your local branch number handy!
(Update) Performed a service on time. Still got yet another phone message of yet another phone number. Every other aspect of Orkin has been good except the national phone tree system.</review>

I was impressed with the lady that answered the phone.  She was able to schedule an appointment within a few hours. The technician phoned ahead; arrived on time; I explained the issue; signed the agreement; and the man began work immediately.
The individual was thorough and kept checking the area. He removed a bee hive. He kept spraying the area. He said he would return in 2 days and re-treat if necessary. I felt an immediate sense of relief. He said if I had any questions prior to his return to call.
This was an excellent experience with Orkin.  I am very pleased I phoned them and would not hesitate to call them again for any possible future pest control issues. Please call the best...and Orkin is the Best!!!
Thank You< /Text>

Very happy with the service provided by ALL of the Orkin Men who have worked on our home and yard.

It’s usually the same 2-3 guys that rotate who show up to do our service. They are very nice, professional, and courteous. I have a young toddler and have a sign outside to please not ring the door bell. They ALWAYS oblige and call my cell phone. (You’d be surprised by how many people still ring the doorbell)

The last time an Orkin Man came I was not home. We had a broken light in the front of our house, I had noticed the day before but it completely slipped my mind and I forgot to sweep up the broken glass on the ground. The Orkin Man called me to let me know it was broken AND that he had swept up the glass! This is above and beyond service that he did not have to do.

We have the Orkin Men come bimonthly. We are very happy with the service and live insect and pest free. Highly recommended.< /text>

All the people I have met so far with Orkin are great and very personable. I submitted my information on the website, and not much time later I received a call getting the details of what I am looking for and setting up an appointment. In no time had Omar here and he was great. Heard us out on all our concerns, was very knowledgeable, and great with working around our pets. As well as noticed a new issue (bees) I didn't notice.< /Text>

Which was perfect timing because in the morning we saw a big rat walking about. It was disgusting! And prior to the sighting this morning there has been rat droppings on our patio table. My husband took a video recording of the areas and good enough a rat has been moonlighting in our patio. It has been almost a year since our subscription. My husband spoke to the technician about the big rats this morning, and the ones caught on video. He says he’ll “check the bait stations”.
Come to think of it not once have we gotten a report that a dead rat has been found. Not much we can do except give him the benefit of the doubt this time around the rats problem would be resolved.

If we don’t see an improvement we will discontinue our subscription.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

We were very pleased with our visit from Chad at Orkin for our 1 year re-inspection for termites. Chad was very friendly, polite, and respectful. He was very thorough with his inspection and went into great detail explaining the results. He seemed very knowledgeable, and gave us several effective options for treating the issues he discovered during the inspection. He quickly earned our trust with his conscientious and caring attitude. Thanks, Chad!< /review>

<Review>I've been with Orkin for more than 10 years and and can highly recommend them.  I should have written prior to this as I've never had any complaints and only the most positive of experiences.  Important to me is communication - and it is very easy to do so...  with  an actual human being! . I can contact my usual technician on his cell phone, or the office is always great too. Today, for example, was typical of their exemplary service.... first, setting the stage: IT'S A FRIDAY AFTERNOON DURING COVID PANDEMIC AND CALIFORNIA UNDER QUARANTINE - so when I came home to find a swarm of bees outside my daughters window - and she suffers from a moderate allergic reaction - I was in a bit of a panic.  I needn't  have worried - I called the local office and the representative was super - she found an available technician to help  - and he was at my home about an hour later (Taylor )!! And this is how they operate during these crazy/unusual circumstances  times.... so imagine their monthly service!!!  Anyway - I don't often write reviews - only do so if I am truly impressed by a service....  (or, alternatively, if I am truly UN - impressed). But I wanted to thank them for all of their help over the past 10-plus years and for keeping my home free of bugs and other icky-ness :) Erin< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80dc74fe606ceb13:0x4c9c08497c912e49< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>This was my first experience using Orkin for our residence.  We had “critters” running around our attic, which was very unnerving to my wife.

l called 2 local companies with 5 star ratings on Yelp and Google. One company could not send a tech for 2 days and could not give me an idea of the cost. Orkin was able to schedule a tech that afternoon and told me exactly what would be included for the price.  Christian, the tech called me to let me know when he would arrive. He was very professional in performing the rodent exclusion work and placing mouse and rat traps, and glue boards in the attic.  He then scheduled a return visit for later in the week to check the traps. I definitely made the right choice.

The only thing that I was unsure about is all scheduling is done through a central call center in another part of the state. That said, the two people I talked to (Darrell and Lorie) were very helpful. All information from my first call had been accurately entered into their database.

All in all so far I am very satisfied and hopeful the critters have moved on.< /Text><resp>None</resp></record>

<Text>We were battling with insects for about 4 years (ants specifically). We had used Corky's one time but it didn't get rid of the pests so it was a waste of money. We were skeptical thereafter and decided to take matters into our own hands but it got out of control. My friend had recommended Orkin and within one treatment, the ants were reduced by 95%, With continued monthly service, very few ants resurfaced. What I like about Orkin is that we can get intermittent treatment when we need without extra charge. Their technicians use a custom approach to track down the nests and adjust as needed. They're not just spraying the insects, but baiting them with the end goal of eradication. Orkin's uses different methods to provide a solution to insect infestation problem. Forget about the other competitors, Orkin will give you incredible results. Their plans are very affordable. I highly recommend them.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< date>

<Text>Won't go without this service! When we moved in it was trails of ants and spiders everywhere. They are super professional and always on time. We have an assigned exterminator which is nice because he's familiar with what we treat and what areas. They do inside and outside for no extra charge. We have dogs and they treat for fleas as preventive maintenance. If there's a specific need you have they treat that as well.

<text>Mason was a friendly and professional representative for Orkin. He was on time and quietly went about his work. He let me know what to expect before he started, and let me know what he had done when he was finished.
This was an initial visit to control rodents. It is my hope that the follow-up service will be timely and effective.< /text><pics>None< /pics><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

<Text>Chad Hebert, our Home Inspector, was very friendly and provided clear and detailed information on our termit situation so we could make the best treatment decision. He was also very sympathetic to my wife's recent job layoff and even went the extra mile to get us a $100 discount. We felt confident that we made the right choice with Orkin and really appreciate Chad's excellent customer service.</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Happy New Year.
Your Orkin service men have been 5 Star.
We've only had two in 20 years in Carlsbad.
Must be a good work environment..
Had Orkin for 50 years before it became Orkin.
We were Grandfather into Orkin and have been grateful for your service!.</Review>

The Orkin process for starting a new service has been professional and efficient. I especially appreciate their flexibility in dealing with us as we are out of town, the service property is a rental, contact with the tenant has been difficult and we have been dealing with wildfire evacuations. We are grateful for the quick and professional service. The technician who contacted me was very thorough, courteous and responsive.</text>

<Review>I have been using Orkin’s termite service for a number of years. Today was the most thorough inspection my house has ever had. Chad was professional and efficient. He checked every area of my home and made recommendations based on what he found. Chad was even able to schedule the additional work that is needed before he left. I was very impressed by the whole process.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

It took way too long to reach someone to make an appointment, when the gentleman arrived we asked him to spray in particular areas and remove dead rodents.  He did not come back to knock on the door to spray our balcony area and was reluctant to relive the vermin which he said would be good to leave.  We said no due to part of the traps being full and the smell it would create. Not happy, now we ha e ants on the balcony he was supposed to spray.</Text>

Christian was professional, personable and his priority was our home, our pets and ourselves. He thoroughly explained everything he was going to do, proceeded to complete those tasks, then did a walk through with me to review the work.

I can’t compliment Christian enough! His service is what I expect from home services. I am happy to say that he is our new partner in pest control!</text>

Chad did an excellent job checking all around my home. He is the first one who actually checked my attic by going completely up there. Not just checking the opening area only. He found three locations outside my home that needs to be treated. He mentioned that someone will come Thursday January 23, 2020 to treat it.< /Text>

Chad was a pleasure to work with not only did he know how to do his job but he was conscientious keeping me on top of how things were progressing, calling me frequently to make sure that I was being taken care of and to ask if there was anything I needed. He was easy to talk to, patiently explained any  questions I might have, making me feel secure in knowing that I was in good hands and everything was being done correctly and in a timely fashion. In a world where consideration and pride in ones work is a rare commodity Chad was the exception I can't praise him enough, Orkin is lucky to have him.<//review>

<Review>I recently had an ant problem due to the heat and the need to leave pet food out for our cat. Upon unsuccessfully spraying ourselves day after day, I decided to reach out to Orkin. I’ve always been skeptical about services like this, but after a single spray our ant problem stopped entirely. Hands down one of the best services I’ve received as a new home owner. Very professional and very polite.

My wife and I later observed a few instances of what appeared to be winged termites in our living room. We again called Orkin and Chad H. came out to investigate. His level of service and professionalism was even more impressive than our first technician (Christian) who dealt with our ants.

Chad took his time and got a full scope of the potential issues with our home. He walked us through all of the potential dangers and gave advice on how to keep things clean and tidy to mitigate insect intrusion. When he completed, he offered additional services for preventative termite care and an attic clean out. He was not forceful in opting in to these services and again was very personable. This was key as even though I questioned the services, his demeanor never changed, he never got frustrated and he left everything on the table. This got me deep as it was apparent he wasn’t forcing a sale and on deeper inquiries on the services I ultimately decided to opt in.

All services have been done well and the teams always arrived on-time.

I highly recommend Orkin and our technician, Chad H. for any and all services. 10/10<//Review>< user_name>

Omar was a great tech. Took care of my bee problem with a 30 day guarantee. I just wish orkin used square D or similar card acceptance to make card processing more secure.< /text>

<Review>We have THE BEST “bug guy” in the business!  Omar not only keeps our yard and house pest free, but he wiped down my trash cans to get all the spider webs off.  He’s always prompt, nice and attentive to all our yard issues. We so appreciate him.  Thanks Omar!  (And Orkin)< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Poor service for too high of price. Billing is the worst.  Address on billing statement is not where the payment is supposed to go - causes delay and communication between departments is horrible.  Price is too high for just interior of a 900 sq ft condo. I have two account and am billed 2x/year, one for each type of termite. Setting up inspection with tenant has improved but still requires several emails. I don’t always receive an inspection report.  My HOA covers exterior but I believe orkin over charging me for both Interior and exterior plus two types of services and I’m not sure if both services are being inspected.< /text>

<review>Chad Hebert was very punctual and knowledgeable. Responded to our concerns and addressed any issues we had immediately. Chad took care of arranging all the work to be done and made it as easy as possible for us. Finished on time as promised. The contractors who took care of the wood repair were outstanding. I would highly recommend Orkin and Chad.</review></record>

Omar is a wonderfully professional. He always is kind courteous and punctual. I have a weird allergy to fleas. Basically I am one a a “lucky” handful of people that attract fleas. After a bite the area swells and is painful for days unless I place a very hot compress on the bites. Before Orkin took over I would have countless bites and thought I was going insane. Both  Omar and his manager worked to come up with a treatment plan that is working for me and my family.<//Review>

<review>I was able to make an appointment for the next day. The customer service rep who helped schedule my appointment was able to wait for me while I had to deal with a small emergency that  kept him on hold for 10 minutes. It was very reassuring to have him work with me, despite other things going on.

The actual pest control servicer, Caesar gave me a 30 min ETA phone call and was quick and efficient in his servicing. He was very polite and courteous. A very promising start.<//review><user_name>Jessica Colston< /user_name>< gmap_id>

<review>I had a dry wood termite extermination service yesterday from Orkin.  It was a good experience.  The service man arrived on time and was very personable.  He explained what he was going to do and did not require me to do anything.  He performed the work cleanly and efficiently.  I was very pleased that there was no odor.  Future inspections will keep my home free of termites.<//review>< time>

<review>Christian went above & beyond to provide exceptional service. He called in advance to let me know what time to expect him, he patiently applied ant bait so we didn't have to spray the whole house, he cleared cobwebs from the patio & diligently sprayed the perimeter of the house to prevent additional intruders. Did I mention Orkin was able to service my home next day? I used to wait a week each time I called Terminix. So happy with Orkin!!</review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dc74fe606ceb13:0x4c9c08497c912e49<//Gmap_id></record>

Angel was very helpful today in helping to cover the end of my rain gutter drainpipes with a type of metal chicken wire so rats could no longer travel up them. After dark the rat would climb up on the inside and get to my roof.  Along with taking down the cobwebs and spraying. Angel did a wonderful job.
Thank you,

<review>Orkin goes above and beyond to make sure that we are happy customers.  Javier and Charles the two technicians that service my home always take a very active interest in controlling whatever situation arises.  I am extremely satisfied and would not hesitate to recommend Orkin.  They have great people working for them. Whatever they are doing to empower their employees, and keep them happy with their work,  the results are very apparent.<//review>< response>

The person who came to treat our house was very courteous and professional. I appreciated most that there was no high pressure sales tactics once I contacted Orkin. I actually contacted them a few months ago and couldn't follow up soon after, and they did not call or email me to try to get me to sign up. We just received our initial treatment but so far I am happy with the service.< /Review>

Orkin recently purchased the company I was using, so today was the first day that I have seen an Orkin truck at my house. When my tech arrived, he came to my door and introduced himself and explained why he was there, asked if I had any issues and made a great first impression. I had already been notified via email about the change so I knew that as part of the intro promo deal, Orkin was offering a free termite inspection and I was interested. I mentioned the termite inspection to my tech and he said he would set me up with their inspection guy ASAP. Little did I know that ASAP meant literally 7 minutes later when I received a phone call from him. Now that is incredibly fast and reliable service. After the tech serviced my house, he spoke with me about what he had done today. As far as first impressions go, Orkin hit it out of the ballpark today.<//Text>

Paul does exceptional work keeping the rats at bay and the fleas away. Since I am a dog sitter, keeping  my home and yard pest free is critical. Paul also takes great care in placing rat traps away from my doggy areas  so that my pets stay safe.
Paul is also sensitive to my  ever-changing schedules with dogs and works around my schedule to make sure that my puppies are not subjected to any poisons.
I appreciate Paul’s attention to detail and his diligence to keep my home safe from unwanted pests.<//Text>

Brent Quick from Orkin has been a god send. His friendly and professional demeanor has made this issue with my home as pleasant as possible. His flexibility, support and clear explanations has made me at ease. I consider him a friend at this point. Thank you so much, Brent!!!<//text>

Charlie was very pleasant and arrived timely after my call to the Orkin office. He listened to my concerns. He explained everything he did to ensure the rat(s) would be caught should it try to enter again. I am just as pleased with the service provided by Charlie as I am with the bi-monthly service provided by Javier!<//review>

I called Orkin because I had a flea problem in the backyard. I called and had same day service. A technician named Javier Gonzales came to my house and was so knowledgeable and his customer service was outstanding. It is so refreshing to deal with a company and staff that values and cares for their customers. No a days it's hard to find transparency with some companies. So far I am very pleased with Orkin and I will Definitely work with them in the future.< /Review>

<Review>Well, once again I was privileged to meet and work with a great Orkin technician. Thanks to Danny Arroyo who came on Friday for my routine treatment.  He was very flexible and polite in co-ordinating our meeting time and then very personable in reviewing the Orkin care of my residence.  He did a very thorough maintence and gave me a favorable report on my bait stations. Yea! Thank you, Danny!  I look forward to working with you.< /Review>< pics>

Irvin is awesome. He explained everything really well and was extra careful about keeping my dog safe during and after the treatment.

The girl I talked to on the phone to make the appointment initially (Vanessa?) was very sweet and made me feel like I was in good hands. The only thing is she told me I didn't have to prepare for or leave the house after the treatment or anything, that they would move anything they needed to during the treatment. This was apparently wrong information, but now I know how to best prepare for next time.

Overall, great customer service experience, now let's see if the spiders stay out of my hair (literally). 😣< /Text>

Orkins' customer service has been top notch from the first time i called in to request a quote, to when a technician actually came out. Our technician Fabian is AWESOME!

They  always do a good job. Before I started I had ants all over the house plus a few spiders. Now there’s no ants or spiders and everything seems to be in good order. One time I had  ants in the kitchen and I gave Orkin a call and they came out the next days to spray the infected area.  Now I don’t even worry about bugs because we have an under control.</review>

Javier is a great tech, and does an awesome job of letting me know when he’ll be here. That’s important for us because we have dogs. Javier understands what’s involved with that, and always gives me a heads up the day before so we can make arrangements. He’s a true asset to your company, and I’m glad he’s our tech. Thank you!< /Review>

Omar from Orkin is amazing. Very kind, patient, on time, and professional. He is very time efficient is so great! Omar is an asset to Orkin and always takes pride in his work!  When we were roach infested and just could not wait for our apartment any longer to do nothing as they were. Orkin stepped in and saved the day. Now roach free and can't thank y'all enough! Best service! Thank you!<//text>

<Text>The Orkin consultant who came to our house was nice, professional, and informative. He was able to spray our house for ants, spiders and other pests.  He gave us some good tips in regards to how to clean up and also noticed where rodents were gathering so we knew where to put traps. Glad there’s a 30 day guarantee and we are very satisfied with the service so far.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

After being a loyal customer for over 7 years, I switched to another local company. 4 months and out of control spiders later, I’m back with Orkin and am never leaving again. They take care of EVERYTHING without my having to think about it. Thank you!!</Text>

Leo came by today he was very courteous and was on time. He did a great job treating inside and outside of the house.

I cancelled my contract because there was no communication as to when they were coming for service. I have a dog and a dog door and need to be able to put the dog inside. When I receive notice of work performed when I wasn't able to close the dog door, how can I have any confidence the service was performed? I feel like I am only a revenue source and not a client who has a service performed for the billing received from Orkin. This is unacceptable...<//Text>

Diego, our technician, is the reason I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Orkin to any of my family and friends. He is prompt, courteous, professional and friendly. Whenever I have questions about the products used or about behaviors of certain pests, he always takes time to explain things to me so that I can feel safer about my pets in areas indoors that he's sprayed or about the habits of scorpions. He's great. Whatever you pay him, you need to double it and then clone him and promote him. :)< /Text>

<review>Coincidentally, we had ants raid our kitchen last night and I got a call that my scheduled appointment was today.  My rep was very professional, patient, and personable.  I’m not a morning person and he worked with my grumpiness gracefully. He took the time to explain what exactly he was doing and why.   It is now 8 hours or so later and my ants are nearly all gone and in the process of killing off their nests. Thank you.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

I have had 3 services done with my plan so far and just after the first plan, there have been no ants inside my home and little to no ants outside. With summer here and this heat, I have seen a few ants outside, but they have not made it inside. The bi monthly follow ups are a huge help! Best decision I’ve made. Orkin saved our food. There are no more lines and lines of ants crawling through the house. Oh and Javier! This guy is awesome!< /text>

The service is very good in that I no longer have problems with ants and other critters around the yard.  However, they now have instituted way too many communications about upcoming service day, arrival of the technician, etc., which clog my inbox and are annoying.</Text>

Love Orkin! Been using them for almost 3 years now. They are accountable, efficient and always on time! It’s very easy to get ahold of our tech, Paul, and he always communicates with me what he saw and sprayed for. I appreciate how thorough he is.<//Text>

<Text>I called on a Saturday desperate for help.  We had an ant infestation and we are selling our house.  I just couldn't get a handle on the problem.  We had another service come out twice for a few different reasons he talked us out of the service.  We were referred to Orkin by our neighbor.  I was able to speak to Danny directly and he showed up on Saturday morning to do the paper work then came back in the afternoon to do the spraying.  We were not home in the afternoon when he was here but he did everything we asked him to.  He was polite and professional.  Seemed very knowledgeable.  We are very pleased with the service.</Text>< Pictures>

I had Orkin from 2003/2004 to 2017... went with another company because of pricing for about 6 months & now I am back. Should have never canceled in the first place.

< Review>
I have had my Orkin service for nearly a year now. The set up of my service was extremely easy and the first technician visit was one day after I called to set up my service. My technicians have been extremely courteous and attentive to my pest issues. All services are thoroughly explained prior to and reviewed at th end of the visit. I am very pleased with Orkin.</Review>

I live within the city limits of San Diego. Just over the years ago, the city removed the leftovers of a building that they tore down 12 years ago (about time, right?). The problem was that mice and rats had moved into the piles of wood and other stuff. When they cleared out the piles, the mice and rats moved into the houses closest to the piles. I was a block away, but was over-run. In less than two months, I had over $22,000 in damage. They are the electrical wires, two sofas, all of the ducts for hearing and air. Orkin (I already had a monthly service contract) was at my house every day (sometimes multiple times a day) until the problem was solved. They did a great job and worked long hours. I continue with the monthly service, but if I see, hear or suspect that I might have a rat or mouse, they respond (usually within two hours) to help me out. I recommend their service and know that if you have a pest problem, they will work to correct the problem.</text>

<text>This is my first time using a pest control service and I’m impressed with the quality of service we’ve received. I only wish I had done this sooner. We originally called because of a mouse problem - YUK! Our yard backs into a field and this is 1st time they found their way into our house. There have also been a few rats that got into our shed. They’re all gone!!! YAY!! We also, seem to live on an ant hill because every summer it was so discouraging to come home to a trail of ants that had found an entry place I hadn’t sprayed. This summer, I only had one incident (pre-treatment) and as soon as I called they were over and I haven’t had an ant since - despite all of our warm days! The service men have all been very courteous. Follow up is great. They call to check if I have any issues. I highly recommend them!< /text>< user_name>

We are incredibly satisfied with the service we have received from Orkin. Over the past several years, we've had three technicians. All of them were/are kind, professional, and helpful. One noticed that our neighbors had moles and spread a deterrent on our lawn to prevent the moles from ruining our yard. We have not found a single ant in our home since we started being serviced. I highly recommend Orkin.</Review>

When I initially called for information about a bed bug inspection I was told it would cost $95 when I called back to schedule the appoinment I was told the inspection was free, I then ask the Rep to check and she confirmed it would be a $95 fee that would go towards the treatment if needed. I scheduled the appointment and provided my debit card  information. When I called on Sat to confirm the appointment time I was told no apppintment had been scheduled.
I'm giving one star because everyone I talked to spoke English. Work on your customer service.</Text>

< Review>
I had a large paper wasp building a nest in my garage where I have my home office. She'd fly past me every 5 or 10 minutes to and from the nest. I'm allergic to bee stings (I have an Epipen) and it's highly likely that a wasp sting would send me to the hospital, so this was truly an emergency. I called Orkin, explained the situation to them, and within 90 minutes a Technician was at my house. He killed the wasp and removed the nest. Not only are the folks at Orkin professional, in this case they saved me from a potentially dangerous situation quickly.<//Review>

<review>Technician is professional and courteous.   I had bad pest issues that retail pesticides could handle. Ever since starting the service I have not had a issue.  Technician always contacts me to see if I am having any issues, explains what he will be doing and lets me know when he is done.  I have had other services in the past, this is the best.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

We’ve been with Orkin for more  than 20 years now and their employees who serve us are outstanding. They are polite and always willing to do more than they are required to do. John was doing our house at Scripps Ranch, Paul at our house at 4S Ranch and now this guy in Del Sur are all have a very good working attitude and superb customer service. What makes me stay with Orkin is because of these hardworking employees. They make sure that they call me when I’m not home and gave me a report of what they did around the yard.  These guys take pride of their work and always have smile on their face. I hope that your superiors will take notice of your hard work and most of all, your excellent interfacing skills with your customers.</Review>

The pest control side of Orkin is pretty good although our new service provider doesn’t compare to our previous guy Diego. He was amazing and went above and beyond. Too bad we had to move. The termite side of Orkin is awful and we’ve unfortunately have numerous issues with them over the last few years. The service from them is absolutely terrible and falls short on every level. Even the local Adan diego manager is horrible. I DO NOT recommend using Orkin to anyone when it comes to termites, clearances or tarpons your house. As far as general pest control goes it is a gamble every other month on how the servicing will go. We only stayed all this time because of Diego and now that we moved I am looking into other companies.< /text>

<review>I wanted to prevent termite invasion and called Terminix  and Orkin.  A Terminix inspector was a "no show" and no call.   After my 2 texts and a call, she texted me saying that she wished to reschedule for another day.  No Thanks!

Orkin inspector, on the other hand, was punctual and courteous.  The person to preventive treatment showed up again on time and very peasant.  The only minor thing to mention is the appointment was scheduled about 2 weeks in advance and we did not hear from Orkin.  On the morning of the treatment, I was  wondering if anyone would show.  We received a call 40 minutes before his arrival, but it would have been nice if a reminder call was made.

My Orkin technician is so friendly and pleasant. I had a real problem this year when termites appeared in 3 sections of my roof overhang. They first did a precision cleaning in my attic and then drilled (and expertly) filled multiple, tiny holes around every window and door with preventive insect repellant. Later a crew showed up to remove 3 sections of fascia boards that were termite infested. They worked like a precision pit crew. After they were gone in less than 5 hours, it looked as if no one had been there. I have been a very happy customer for 4 years!<//Text>

Always a smile and asks if you have problems with any bugs and takes care of the situation. I have told my friends about your service based on having Omaras my BugMan.

Summer is here and so are the ants and the spiders.  Our service today was focused on our normal issues but the representative spent additional time working on the ants, knocking down spider webs and treating our very large property for spiders.
Great service!</Review>

We had a bad start with Orkin.  They were posting on my Orkin account they made site visits.  We had 4 visits to our account and one on a Sunday.  I called Orkin to see what was going on.  Orkin said they don’t work on Sundays.   For one we have a gate at the driveway that needs a remote and a large dog.  We know for sure the Orkin rep would not acess the yard.  Orkin sent out Gaberial, the rep for our area, and he got to work. He was very apologetic but professional.   We now have him to take care of the pests. He took our numbers and he will text the day before he is coming out.  Let’s hope this all works out or we will be canceling our service.</review>
