<Review>I went in this last weekend (Saturday morning) to close out my ex-husband’s phone line due to him passing away recently. The staff members that were working were extremely helpful, respectful, and friendly. They helped me through the whole process and the manager that was present even gave me a great recommendation for a restaurant as I was in California from out of state. These employees showed what great customer service looks like and I’m very grateful for them.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x809ae76431d4f60f:0xc1bffb99525dd3fc</Gmap_id></record>

Shelby and Miranda were extremely helpful and very nice. I wanted to make changes to my phone plan and they went out of their way to make sure I was taken care of. 5 out of 5 would recommend.</text>

<Review>SHELBY !!!!

Let me start by saying what a treat it was to have Shelby personally handle my cellphone issues.  What I perceived to be an insurmountable technical hurdle was nothing but a cakewalk for Shelby.  She not only handled my phone issues with ease and professionalism, but she multitasked simultaneously several other customers (some with kids), a building power issue and even a potential in-store theft all at lightening-quick speed - and with a warm, fun personality to boot.  TMobile - you better lock Shelby up otherwise I can definitely see her solving some of California's toughest issues as the next Governor. Thank you Shelby for making this easy.  I'm happy to be a TMobile customer with support like this.</Review>< user_name>

I had to wait 45 minutes since apparently only he can do anything useful, just to find out they can't transfer my number to a new phone. It was a pain just to buy a new sim card, of which, you now have to buy a 4 pack for $10 instead of one for $3. Consider changing providers or at least go to a different store.</review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x809ae76431d4f60f:0xc1bffb99525dd3fc< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

When I first got my phone from this sprint store I thought I was getting a great deal.  15 months later I am still dealing with them about selling me a phone under a promotion that expired, and they refuse to honor it.  In fact, my phone bill went from $97 a month to now $120.  So, all you guys happy with sprint now,  give it a few months.< /Review>

Let me preface with that I have been with Sprint since 2004 with absolutely no problems and always have received amazing customer service. I went in for an upgrade and had to trade my old phone in, but because it had a less than 1/4" crack the charge was going to be $125. I simply was not going to pay it because I know people that have had that fee waived. I went back and forth with a manager on duty; if he was the store manager than he definitely needs better customer service skills. I have been a manager before, I understand policies, but you never let a loyal customer go out the door period. That is what happened Sprint let me walk, so I switched to Verizon. Never looking back.< /text>

All stores have their ups and downs... however, given that I live extremely close to this Sprint store and that I have had Sprint service since 2004 and I do not plan on changing my service provider in the near future.  The employees at this store really give their all.  Cory, the assistant manager, helped calm me down last night when I called right before they closed, to ask for help with my cell phone.  It was very HOT and not turning on or anything.  One blue light and I was extremely frustrated.  Cory assured me that he would help me the next day figure out what is wrong with my phone, as well has the main manager, Jessica.  They are very curious and willing to do what it takes to help their customers.  Thank you everyone.  See you soon.<//text>

<pics>None</pics><Text>We just visited Sprint at 8909 Madison Ave Fair oaks CA. Best visit ever! I just purchased a note 10 plus! First time ever bought a just released electronic. Sierra and Adam were amazing. Adam was more of a droid guy and new all the specs and benefits of this phone for my busy service industry career. Sierra did all the paper work with my wife. The price was so good. I included the liquid glass screen protector. I also bought a wireless charger... with no pressure from these two excellent customer service representatives. Additionally Sierra educates is on a gps tracker that will help is lower our insurance rates. This location needs more recognition Sprint! I visited in January and was ready to buy a samsung watch but that location didnt carry them. I bought her motorola air pods but she ended up not using them. Point being excellent store even better staff... perfect location...(I sent my 11 year old next door to make some yogurt while everything was processed) today confirms why I switched from Verizon to Sprint! I LOVE MY NOTE 10 PLUS!< /Text>< resp>

<Review>I first came to this location while David and Tyler Perry worked here and they treated me so great i will only ever visit this location! That being said, tonight's adventure of trying to get a new phone was no different. There was a new girl, i didn't catch her name but she was a sweetheart. Jeremy was crazy helpful, knowledgeable, and provided excellent customer service. Jonothan (who was handling my transaction)  was so unbelievably  awesome! He made this nightmare of a day so much easier. Had me laughing and made this trip so easy and personable. I could go on and on about how much i appreciated his help and attitude, but i will save myself from arthritis from all the typing. I cannot say enough great things about him, but lets just put it this way, if he transferred out of this location and i knew where to, i would drive pretty damn far out of my way to go to his store.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Went in to order a new phone because my phone had broken. First off it was very busy; but I work in sales so I know how business it is around the holidays. After about a 20 minutes wait I greeted by the store manager Jeremy. He told how the insurance you must wait for your phone. Not sure why when they'll receive the new phone and have lots in the store. I understand its a policy just a terrible one. Now these were just some problems experienced; but what really got me writing this was the store manager. As a manager you should have no to little complaints. The manager after talking with him so a while he came off very rude and disrespectful. The manager acted as if he knew everything and every time I said something wrong about Sprint's policy he would make a smart ass joke. Just because I don't work at Sprint doesn't mean that you can make smart ass jokes about your customer's to them. I saw this happen to almost every customer and found it to be a very unprofessional place as he even joked about his co-workers. I hope this Sprint makes big changes soon for now I'll head to the store off East Bidwell.< /text>

<name>Brandy Hilbert< /name><user>112932166208249743248< /user><Text>My husband and I recently made the switch from Verizon to Sprint. Initially we just went in to ask a couple of questions about Sprint's iPhone leasing program and upgrade allowances. After about a gazillion questions, we decided to make the switch from Verizon to Sprint resulting in about a $60 a month savings. We could not be happier with the call coverage and personal service we received. The staff at this location, specifically Jonny, was incredibly knowledgeable and patient as he sat on the phone for over 30 minutes with Verizon to verify my account change  (I apparently forgot my password) so that I could keep my number. Thanks again Jonny!<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I signed up for Sprint services, coming from At&t at the end of October 2017.  There were many promises made to me and miscommunications.  The first thing that happened was our phones sat at the store for over two weeks, because they called the wrong number to inform us our phones were in.  Justin the sales associate who helped me, at your store located at 8909 Madison Avenue #404 Fair oaks CA 95628.  He had sold me several accessories for the phone, put the screen protector on my phone then proceeded to ring up my bill, the computer system was down and he charged three different cards of mine trying to get them to work, none did, then he demanded I pay cash.  I told him, I did not have any cash on me.  Could he save my card information so we can leave with the merchandise or bill my account, both he and his manager Jessica said no that was not possible.   Jessica then told him “that will teach you for applying the screen protector on before the customer pays” AS IF it were my fault your systems were down!!  They then ripped the screen protector off one of the 4 phones we had just purchased and sent us on our way.
I cannot believe your store manager has that poor of customer service!!
During this time, we were NEVER told that we would not receive an actual bill that it was all through email and you have to set up the account online to even see the bill, nor did they bother to tell me that we would be charged $5.00 per phone per month for not doing auto-pay.  They also signed us up for two additional phones, Justin had convinced me that it would not cost any extra, then he proceeded to sign the phone up for insurance.  The first time my phone was disconnected I went into the store and Jessica helped me, this was sometime in December.  She took my payment, but again NEVER bothered to mention, auto pay.  She said she could not help me until my service was back up and running and sent me on my way.  Then I went back into the store on January 13th and I spoke to Justin to complain about my bill, since it was over $250 more than we had originally been promised.  He went through it with me and explained all the mistakes that were made and told me that I would have better luck getting the charges reversed by the customer service line.
I then called your customer service line today, they refused to waive over $100 in fees that were charged due to disconnection fees and late fees, because we never received a bill and they would only refund $63.00.  They were rude and not apologetic what so ever!  I want all of the fees reversed that were charged due to not receiving a bill and an apology and somebody needs to give your team at the Fair Oaks store some serious customer service lessons!   BUYER BEWARE there are many hidden fees with sprint!  & the fact that you cannot use the internet or text while your on the phone is a huge inconvenience.  Their service is far worst than AT&T and I am sorry I left AT&T........</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

<review>AVOID. This store ripped me off BIG TIME Sept 2017. Its a franchise store not corporate. Sketch salesman, lied and Sold us on a promotion that wasn't valid. He was covering from a north highlands store. This caused, still causing me 9 months of hell and overcharging. Store mgr jessica attempted to help, then backpedaled and left us high and dry. Im still locked in contracts and a sketch deal. Ive been thru hell and back with corporate, escalations, account services. I signed up for a $90 plan, lease one phone get one..but i regularly get bills for $212 to $262.00 a month!! Sprint is the absolute worst company. Horrid customer service. Really LOUSY network coverage. They overcharge and play games. Phones we got arent that great either.<//review>< Pics>

<rating>1< /rating><review>After downloading Samsung software update to my galaxy S4, desktop functionality took a hit and no longer functioned normally. Brought my phone to these guys, demonstrated the problem and showed them the resultant error message. Rather than solve the problem or even search (sprint's technical database or online) for a known solution as I recommended, tech instead explained that the problem was my "older" phone-  its software was simply not capable of running the latest firmware updates from Samsung, which are meant for the more powerful, latest generation phones. Really?? A company as big as Samsung would knowingly send a flawed system update to millions of customers and intentionally render their phones obsolete? That's Samsung's business model? "Sucks to be you, but looks like you need a new phone! Yep, we realize Samsung's update is what caused the problem, but there's really nothing we can do." Really?? Just doesn't seem right somehow-  know what I mean?
Despite my repeated protests and obvious concerns, tech jonathon instead offered to "help" me finance a new $780 phone. Wow, that's what I call customer SERVICE! Thanks but NO thanks guys. Don't need the financing. Certainly DON'T need a new phone. Went online, did a quick search, found multiple solutions, had the problem solved in ten minutes...
Thought the technicians at Sprint were there to help. Instead, they take advantage of the technically complex nature of modern phones and attempt scam customers into making purchases they don't need. That's my take, anyway. One man's opinion, mileage may vary.< /review>< pictures>

<Text>The staff was friendly for the most part, but organization is lacking here. I came for a pre-employment drug screen, physical, and blood work and I wasn’t even able to make an appointment. I was told these could only be completed as walk-in only. Thankfully however, I didn’t have to wait too long as I got there first thing in the morning. When coming in, they didn’t let me finish my paperwork and rushed me to the back to start the physical. By the time the doctor came to see me, he seemed visibly annoyed that my paperwork wasn’t done and I heard him reprimanding the staff. Not the most professional.< /Text>< pictures>

Dr Luis Rivera shouldn't even work as a doctor who knows from where he received his degree but he is very unprofessional an rude, he wasn't wearing his mask an wasn't wearing appropriate doctor's clothing not just that but the way he did he job was shocking an awful experience anyone has to go through I don't recommend this clinic to anyone the 2 secretary's at the front desk are rude when I had ask a question regarding my doctor's appointment,  also the secretary with blonde hair doesn't wear her mask at all they are very unprofessional an it's an unsafe environment to go to the doctor.  God bless them 🙏</Review>

<Name>Tobe Primicerio</Name><Text>The receptionist was very cold after she read my referral slip (I didn't even know what it said until she read it aloud.  I was referred for a UA because a coworker falsely accused me of being under the influence.  My test results will attest to the fact that it was a false accusation.  She read my referral aloud and then proceeded to be rude.  (“If you would have read the questions, you would have seen this...” etc). It was very humilitiatng especially since the accusation was entirely false.  However, the lab tech that assisted me in the back was very kind and helped me, taking into consideration how embarrassed I was.  She was very gentle and engaged me in chit chat.  This, I gave the visit 3 stars.< /Text>< pics>

< Review>
Medical staff was incredibly rude and unprofessional, questions/comments about my health/condition were out of pocket and made me extremely uncomfortable as they were asked loudly outside of a doctors office. The receptionist was antagonizing and cruel in her obtaining my information. She could see I had a cane and a physically hard time walking yet rudely asked me to come up multiple times when it could have been done in one sweep. She also “claimed” I need extra paperwork from my employer when that was just not the case. I waited for a new receptionist and then I was processed immediately with no trouble.< /Review>

Regarding my last visit I waited 2 hours just to be put in a room to wait another 1/2 hr.  I've also noticed when you do see the Dr. he stands outside the door asks how you're doing and with no real exam.  I'm the one to make recommendations to try and get any kind of fix or relief of my personal situation. Dr. paid no attention to my bout with stomach issues due to a less potent OTC NSAID and prescribed me a more powerful one (NSAID) that has irritated my stomach even more!  I thought he'd at least refer to the questionnaire we are told to fill out but his visit proved he doesn't!<//text>

This center was way too crowded. They clearly overbook appointments. It’s hard to maintain distance from others because you have to wait in a long line inside to check in, along with multiple people sitting around waiting. They also don’t clean the seats the patients sit in while getting their blood drawn. There’s a sign saying they clean in between patients, but I didn’t see them clean when one left and another sat down. Avoid the Tustin one and go to the Irvine one that’s much cleaner and less crowded.</Review>

<Review>I came in for a drug test and the front desk staff were not very friendly. I could overhear all of their unprofessional conversations while I waited. Bad mouthing the doctor to be specific. I wasn’t seen until they were about to close for the day. I understand doctor offices can get busy but I’ve never experienced such a slow drug test process. The woman that took me for the test was very nice so there’s that.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

<review>Worst orthopedic doctor, rude, arrogant and horrible bed manners. Unprepared, had not checked my file prior to my visit, made it my fault that the other Concentra doctor did not provide all necessary documentation he needed. Worst experience !

<review>Horrible experience. I'm here to request Medical Records. Very rude I was told to come another day when I said no because I live pretty far. the front desk lady told me to wait for an hour. Really?? How long does it take just to get it? I'm in the medical field and I know how it all works. She's acting brand new! I've been here for an hour just to get  ONE page.!! The lady in the front is really slow and rude. The fact that I came from far and also to pay to get my record, its ridiculous.<//review><resp>None< /resp></record>

Horrible experience.  I made an appt in person  for 1230p, concierge said "okay,  your set for 1230" (for X date). I later received a text that my time was at 1100A.  I called to confirm that its suppose to be 1230p and the concierge informed me that "the Doctor goes to lunch from 12p-1p". So Why the hell am I given that time to begin with!!?
Since I had no choice, I agreed to change it to one that afternoon.   I arrived a few minutes beforehand.  From The wait time in waiting room to the room I was taken to,  it was literally a TWO HOUR WAIT!! 😡😡😡
The NP that finally decided to come in to see me had an excuse of  "we're so busy" there was literally TWO people ahead of me.  AND I had stepped outside my door (for waiting too long) for a good ten minutes and that same NP was LAUGHING IT UP,  CHIT CHATTING with other Co workers talking about non sense. SMDH.
I've been to other workers comp before with a different employer and the wait time was 20min at the most.  It's too bad I don't remember it's name.</review>

<Rating>3</Rating><review>I was stupefied when I came back to this facility to get my PPD test read. It involved looking at the injection site to see if there was redness or induration. It was done a couple of days after receiving the injection.  The reason I was puzzled is that I was not asked for an I.D. Even though the technician said he remembered me, that was not up to professional standards or good practice protocol.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Doctor treating me did not listen to my concerns, also when I transferred care and went to request my medical records because I did not want to expose myself to unnecessary radiation,  front desk staff told me it could take MONTHS. I will be filing a formal complaint regarding this.< /Text>

<text>The young lady at the front desk was very pleasant. Upon walking into “urgent care” I was asked why I was needing to be seen which is typical. I informed her what was wrong and she told me the doctor on duty doesn’t accept private patients but she would talk to him to see if he was willing to do so. She walked around for a few minutes trying to find him and couldn’t. She informed me that there were a couple urgent cares that would accept private insurance. That specific doctor only wanted to see workers compensation patients.</text>< pictures>

Dr. Vachira Tanate was horrible. No one tells you the wait its 2 hours and with an approved claim after telling them how rude they are for making people wait, he discharged me. He didn't 10 minutes with me and was retaliated with go see my primary for my known impinged nerve. Put me with no restrictions. There was only 2 people in the waiting room. Front staff didn't say anything except you'll be seen next. Yeah .. next in 2 hours with a doctor who has no time for you. You took that long to see me and then say you can't spend more time with me because he'll delay other patients. Really .... GTFOH!!!! They are the business to make money for nothing.</Review>

Front desk staff was very friendly but their P.A. in duty was not even helpful at all. I had an appointment and still waited almost an hour to even be seen. Finally when the PA came he just rushed through and didnt even care about hearing me out. So what's the purpose for a revisit, just to sit and wait for an hour for nothing.< /text>

Do not go to ANY of these so called medical places. The wait was long, however my issues started after my 1 and ONLY visit. I thought my then health insurance would cover the cost of my visit, guess again. These people have the nerve to hound you to pay them for their "services", what services, all they did was take my vitals, 1 x-ray then give me a boot cast and refer me to a foot specialist. These guys are very unprofessional, once I called back to get an understanding of the charges- they rudely stated for me to call their corporate offices- which were on the east coast. Then I get directed to a collection agency who were way more helpful and understanding than these douchebags. Never again- I've had better customer service at health clinics with the staff barely speaking English.<//review>

For work, I was sent over to take a drug test, these guys tried to give me x-rays. They should be brought to a medical review board.< /Review>

< review>
Had to wait over an hour for a drug test while I watched several others who came in after me go before me. Unfriendly front desk staff. Now I'm finding out they may have messed up my pre employment process. Avoid this facility.<//review>

<Text>I arrived to the door at 3:58AM to catch the 4:00AM bus it had already left,, I al.ost missed my flight due to driver not patient enough to wait for passengers arriving 2 minutes before scheduled departure time. I will be catching Uber in the future.</Text><name>Dwight Jones Sr. (DJ)<//name>< user>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>Flyway is awesome! 10 bucks to go to the airport and you get dropped of right at what ever airlines you're flying with. We used this service for the first time Aug 13th Tuesday at 430pm and our driver did an excellent job. He was very professional. If you're ever in L.A and need to get to the airport. Try this service!</Review>< Pics>

<time>1565519850424</time><review>The Van Nuys FlyAway is the greatest thing since sliced bread!  It makes going to LAX a breeze. It's under 10 bucks for a one-way bus ride and they get you there in record time, dropping you off right at your terminal. The busses are in great condition and comfortable. If someone isn't able to drop you off, then you can park your car there for 5 bucks a day. Super convenient!<//review><UserId.>116992800507045820329<//UserId.><Pics>None</Pics><gmapID>0x80c297544c2a7f9f:0xdd622bf3b582d004< /gmapID>< Response>

Great airport parkjng and the service is also great.  Key thing.... pay for your parking with a credit card, the machines don’t always give change and the folks on site may not have change.... sometimes the bus can fill up, so doesn’t hurt to catch an earlier bus if you are traveling at a peak time.  Love this service!  If you allow enough time and pay with credit its a breeze!</Review>

Very Convenient ride from Van Nuys to the L.A.X. airport. Inexpensive tickets and about 30 mins to get there! Pretty cool that they had a charger portable to recharge my computer & phone.</Review>

I am deaf, they I tried to purchase ticket and a lady asked me need help something? I told her I am good and I just let you know I am deaf. A lady said oh you deaf? Please come with me. I was like what, I've been travel everywhere and I know how to use it so sure i will follow that lady anyway. She give me nice ticket and told a drive that I am deaf, asked me where to? I told driver to Los Angles airport, southwest airline. He said will keep in mind to let me know when I ready to get off bus. They are very friendly! Once I get there, they remember to tell me to get off in right area where I need to go! Love staff there.< /review>

< Review>
Ticket Lady has closed access to the bus 5-6 minutes earlier than the website says. Generally unbelievably unfriendly. Laughs passengers because they did not make it in time. Bus was still 12 minutes outside standing and was loaded before he started driving. It would not have been a problem to pick up a passenger. Just because the ticket-aunt did not have a fancy to do her job, my mother missed her bus and thus her flight too. absolutely ridiculous and outrageous. Definitely not recommended, due to the terrible staff.< /Review>

Cheap and safe way to park and/or take a ride to/from LAX. I left my vehicle here once for 10 days and did the round trip bus ride with no issues, and I also flew into LAX once with no ride home so I took a one way bus ride to the Van Nuys terminal and used Uber to get home.< /text>

Posted signs state the bus closes 2 minutes before departure time. But they cut off as I approached at 7 minutes before departure.  The bus wasn't full and the next bus was 30 minutes later.  Bad compliance.< /text>

<Review>Very unfriendly staff,I got there with a paid ticket only to be told I have to wait for the next bus,I actually can see the bus doors still open and the guy is telling me the door is  closed, I also can see it's only about 50% full, the bus doesn't even pull out for another 5 min, what a power trip .Very poor customer service.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

< Review>
I was excited to come to del taco as they sent coupons in the mail. I try to save money where I can and coupons help when I need a quick meal as I work 2 jobs and go to school. The workers told me 1 coupon per person. I will not be returning.</Review>

I had a reasonably pleasant experience.

This stores drive through lane has a weird u-turn-ish corner you have to navigate. Then when you leave it’s kind of tight getting out of the parking lot, especially when there’s a steady movement of cars entering the complex on a cross street.

The food was good. Standard del taco.

The service was good. It usually is at this location.<//review>

<Text>The Crispy Chichen Guac burritos were good but the 15 min wait for the tiny milk Shakes was incredibly inconvenient and by then my food was Cold.

I had to go inside to even get them as I was left waiting in the parking lot for them with nothing being brought out as promised.

ADVICE :If the shakes aren't ready don't tell the customer it will be 3 minutes and then take 15.  Just telI the Customer the truth so you don't waste their time, make their food get cold and make the customer angry.

I personally would rather be told accurately that the shales the going to take a while so that I could just forgo the wait and skip the Shakes and be on my way.

The Crispy Chicken Guac burritos were good though after the wait they were no longer warm.</Text><GmapID>0x80853d442ed7a6fb:0xfafcc886c6ba52be< /GmapID>< response>

🤠 I ate tamales there, they were very good. This was my first time eating there. A friend recommended me try eating there.  It's very clean restaurant and easy to get here from Travis Air Force Base. On my way to Outlets in Vacaville community. Keep up the very good work. 🍇🍇🍇🍇🍇</text>

<review>Wow it says they are closed at 11pm and they wouldn't take my order for a few tacos at  10:19pm 3/12/20 saying they are "about" to close? Change your hours, that's false advertisement because I would have came earlier or somewhere else because I figured 41 minutes would be plenty of time to make tacos. I used to work fast food and we took in orders til the time we said we closed, no matter how large. No other customers was there; they looked pretty slow so they could do  most the closing duties before 11. Terrible service, very upsetting.< /review>< time>

The experience was great. The food was fairly priced, everyone's order was made correctly, and we all enjoyed the food. My only dislike is the fact that they do not chop their own onions according to the employees.< /Review>

Please train your employees more when they need it. I placed my order and the drive-thru cashier repeated the wrong order back to me, I then told her my order again, and again, my order was repeated back to me incorrectly. I then ordered my food a 3rd time and the cashier appeared to not comprehend what I wanted to order, so she told me to come up to the window. I drove up and had to wait almost 2 minutes and was not greeted or anything. I had to tell her again, and when I handed her my $1 off coupon, she attempted to tell me my total, which was higher than my order price, so I asked her "that's with the coupon?" She did the total again, and said the same higher total, so I told her again, that's not correct (she was trying to charge me the amount off my last receipt). Once she figured it out (and it was STILL incorrect), I gave her my card. After I handed her my card, she handed me my food and before I could say anything, she promptly shut the window. I had to wait till she opened it back up to ask for my receipt. She never said "thank you" or "sorry, I'm new, thank you for your patience" or anything.

AGAIN, PLEASE TRAIN YOUR EMPLOYEES. I enjoy eating at Del Taco, but today was the worst service I've had.< /Review>

<text>I get my fish tacos at Del Taco and they are the best. Out of all the places I've tried Del Taco has the best fish or shrimp tacos. They are served with fresh cabbage and a lime slice..so if you are in Vacaville stop by and try Del Tacos fish or shrimp tacos. They have a great menu and the employees are the greatest..enjoy<//text></record>

They seemingly always have some issue opening on time or not having something, making every visit a mystery and often pointless. When everything does work out right, the food is good, but will usually have a 10 minute wait for the simplest of orders.< /Review>

The Del Taco in Red Bluff screwed up our order and we didn't know all of it until we were on the road for 15 minutes. We called the Vacaville location and they said they'd remake it for free eventhough they are different franchise owners. Very happy with them. Highly recommended. Also the Beyond Meat Epic burrito is amazing.< /Text>

<Review>We make the drive to Hillsboro on Thursdays because we love Del Taco....but this will probably be  our last visit. The quality of the food has drastically declined over the last month. Today the tortilla on the burritos were hard, there was no chicken in our tacos to speak of, and the fries were cold and tasteless. I am really sad because there are not many Del Tacos around and to make the 40 minute drive to be disappointed is not worth it.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><user_id>108496383398181896465<//user_id><gmapID>0x80853d442ed7a6fb:0xfafcc886c6ba52be</gmapID><user_name>Vonya Pinson< /user_name>< Rate>

<Review>I usually never write reviews but I just had to for this Del a taco. I had the pleasure of being served by one of the most energetic and friendliest cashiers. Kept referring to me as "my brotha". Put a smile on my face as the world needs more people like this dude.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Food was fine, but a young caucasian girl was NOT concerned about my need to use the restroom (I was going home to Sacramento)...the key was supposedly lost...I was told I could go across the street to hot dog place to use THEIR restroom. Fortunately, a nice Hispanic woman was able to open the door for me, so I could use the restroom. The above young woman was also very "curt" to my elderly friend when she enquired if my order was correct....< /review>

Thank God I recovered..
Don't go to the one on Alhambra Blvd and a woman was being racist toward me because she tripped over my roll bag because she seemed high. I called the police..
She left in a hurry..
Scary to some of the people that go in there and its close to a middle school.<//review></record>

If I could no stars I would. I went through the drive thru and there was a truck at the window. I pulled up to order and the lady said to hold on, which is ok. 3 minutes went by and I said hello and the woman said I could order. I ordered 1 taco and I would get my total at the window.
I sat behind the same truck for 5 more minutes before it pulled away. I got to the window and paid, then got my 1 taco and it was disgusting. All the sauce was in the middle with cilantro that was brown and wilted.
Since I had already wasted 10 minutes on 1 taco I wasnt about to go back and complain. Not going back to this Del Taco!</Review>

They NEED TO IMPROVE ON THEIR TIMES!!!

THERE ARE TIMES WHERE I'M IN DRIVE THRU FOR 10MINS. THERE IS ONLY 3 OR LESS CARS IN DRIVE THRU.

I WORKED IN FAST FOOD AND THEY SERIOUSLY NEED TO IMPROVE ON THEIR TIMES.

I HAD TO WAIT 5MINS JUST TO ORDER 3 STRAWBERRY LEMONADES.

ONLY TO BE TOLD, "GIVE ME ONE MIN"

TO WHICH I REPLY I ONLY WANT 3 STRAWBERRY LEMONADES.2 SMALL 1 MED.

IT DOESNT TAKE LONG.< /text>

< Review>
I come to Del Taco exclusively for their buck & under value menu.  It is very disappointing when you come to a location such as this and see the price of a bean burrito at $1.49  that's a 50% inflation over the standard chain pricing that normally makes Del Taco such an incredible value (at other locations).  In addition to this, the person at the register accidentally charged me for an extra item that I didn't ask for and had to go through the hassle of refunding and recharging a new order.

The food quality was decent, the chicken roller I got was tasty.  I also tried some of the churros and they were caked in sugar, just way overdone.  I would avoid this location and hold out for other Del Tacos, even if someone tells you it's right next to Target don't believe them.</Review>

The man working the counter the night of 12 May 2018 was outf**kingstanding. He was professional, kind and engaging. The food was...DelTaco...you know what you are getting yourself into. But I would go back just because of the superb customer service. Keep up the good work brotha.</Text>

I should have read the reviews before picking this spot from Google Maps on my road trip - the weight in the Drive-Thru line is unacceptably long, I wasted as much fuel as I did paying for the food... I'm still in the line as I write this because I couldn't believe that it was taking so long< /Review>

They don't have deals at this location and charge for secret sauce when it's free everywhere else.</Review>

Rude ass people esp the short black guy. My husband only asked for the price of a large drink and he goes to one of his other co worker and asked her to ring us up. Hus excuse was that my husband asked too many questions. They are rude as hell!</Review>

<text>Usually I like filling up here but today my car broke down and wouldn’t start. I was able to move it out of a pump spot and onto the side area but the gas station employee, a middle aged man, motioned me over to complain that I was in the way of other customers and if the gas truck came to fill up the station I would be a problem. Even after I explained that I would be gone in less than 30 min he still tried to yell at me so I walked away and watched him angrily stare me down for 30 min. Now I’ll happily fill up at the Mobil down the road.

Everytime I come to put gas here the gas attendant is always in the restroom for 30 min minimum, one time I waited 45 min (it's always the same guy). I like putting gas here but I cannot put up with this anymore this is the fifth time this happens.</Text>

Doesn't have a public restroom and i think that every gasoline place should have a restroom. The reason I have a problem with I is because you havento deal with walking in the store hoping that there is a bathroom when your child needs to go bad but no there isn't. Please fix this for the next time i go to california.<//Text>

<Text>OMG, I dont have words to describe the profesionalism of Western Metal Deck and its staff. I even had the opportunity of talking to the very  same owner , and let me tell you that it was an amazing experience. Since my first phone call they provided me with all information and I am soo glad that I finally found a metal deck company that surpassed  my expectations. I highly recommend Western Metal Deck for any of your  projects, small or big they can easily handle it.</Text>< response>

Easy to work with and sales rep knowledgeable of the products they sell. Alex Alvarez was of great assistance via email when answering my concerns and over the phone when I had additional questions. Give them a try, I recommend using them for your next metal roof deck or floor deck project. We've used them twice for two different projects.<//review>

Bob and Alex have been helping me on all of my structural projects, supplying me with metal decking in all sizes and types that I have needed over the last 15 years!!! Customer service is top notch and I always get a quote within 15 minutes of calling.  Their forklift operator is on point every time I go and pick up my material! He will load your material quickly and safely so that you can move onto the job site and stay on schedule! Just give them a call and Nita will direct you the right person to answer any question you might have and provide you with a quick and competitive quote!</text>< pics>

Bob and Kathy are wonderful and very helpful.
Also, all their staff is really helpful & friendly!
Delivery is always on time and they are always ready to answer any questions for their customers.
100% recommend them for all your decking needs!!!<//Review>

A special kudos to Jim for identifying and solving the problem I had with a citrus tree I bought some time ago from there. He really cares about the plants and the customers.
It’s nice to have a dedicated nursery close instead of the big box businesses who don’t specialize in the products.<//review>< Pics>

This new location is really great. So much to choose from and everyone is very helpful. Trees, succulents, flowers, vegetable starts, soil, everything you need for a yard, or garden.</review>

<text>Love Love LOVE this place. I'm a born hater with a frugality trait, so saying love means a lot from me. Prices, native selection, outdoor selection, fruit tree selection, service, customer service - top notch as far as I can scrutinize. I've only been to the newest location in Eastvale. From the pictures and reviews posted up about their other locations, their indoor/tropical plant selection and prices is suppose to be above the local average, but sadly my visits keep landing on the hump days their restocking times and they seem to still be setting up the greenhouse in which the tropicals are suppese to be located in. I sell tropicals/houseplants online and it becomes pricey to drive far to only buy what is still considered less than the wholesale amount. I'm moving to the Riverside/Jurupa Valley area at this moment, so this nursery + their prices being only 5 minutes away is just a dream. I support our local(ish) companies as much as I can(I try, but not to hard haha) so this nursery selling Kellogg soils(Ontario), my favorite and go to soil ammendment, is great but seems to be priced a little bit higher than say, Home Depot. I went on September 9, 2020 to those of you who are interested in Kellogg's Shade Mix: this nursery does sell it but they(like everywhere else) are waiting 3+ months to get it in stock as it seems to be something awry on Kellogg's end.

I'm a simpleton with a 4 track mind, if you don't know what this means, here's the translation: This nursery is a new favorite of mine and I'll be dragging the hubby and the baby(both of which hate dirt, heat, and feel nothing for plants) here more often than even I can forsee. So I will be sure to keep this review UTD. I'll aim to review + piccys each time I visit, but we'll see what goes.

Thanks for the read. Hope my rantings have helped some of you somehow. Otherwise, sorry you wasted your time reading this haha

From ground cover to trees, from fruit to vegatables, Sunshine has it all.  Although the tomato varieties are not the best this Spring, the peppers are, and the prices are as good as typical.<//text>

<text>Small selection of indoor plants, prices are better compared to the westside. The sales guy, an elderly big guy, gray hair, wearing eye glasses, bad attitude though, didn't do much and spoke to you with an attitude. Watch out for that guy. The workers in the field is super sweet and helped you get the plants into your car.< /text>< Resp>

Parking is much better and some on pavement. The prices for most plants are good, and they have a good selection. The only thing I would criticize is the register line and pay process in the sales building.  A double door for two lines and also exit, the line extends outside in the hot sun, so bring an umbrella for shade. its cumbersome to pay and exit when busy at the register. But people there are super nice.</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

I've been here a few times each time the service was outstanding. I'm new to gardens i can't speak to the quality of soil. Their service has been great so far. Any questions are gladly answered. The pricing is better than. Home depo. After buying a few bags at a higher cost from home depo I found these guys. Time will tell how good the soil is.<//Text>

Was all set to order sod today.. Was told the sod I wanted to purchase was one price + $50 delivery charge. I told them I have a truck, it's one pallet and your only a few miles away I will pick it up myself. When they heard I was picking it up myself they changed the price. Said it was to cover "labor".. I said the forklift putting it in my truck had a "labor" charge. I was already paying almost $500 for the sod. I decided NOT to order the sod. I called around and went with A-G Sod in Nuevo.. Saved me over half the price!! Gave me a discount for picking it up.. was EXTREMELY helpful. I highly recommend them..
Sunshine price $500
A-G Sod in Nuevo getting 60 more sq ft. $250.00!!!!
So basically the $250.00 plus Sunshine was originally making wasn't enough profit, they needed to add the "labor" charge for more..
Just lost a customer....

<UserId.>106310469825708911510</UserId.><text>Went there a few times and got few fruit trees, vegetable plants and many succulence. The plants are healthy and there are so many choices. They drive you to look for the tree you want if that's too far away. Today I made a phone call to ask about the fruit trees I purchased 2 years ago. The soft-talking guy, my favorite employee, spend a lot of time to explain how to take good care of my trees and answered all my questions. I'm really appreciate!< /text>< response>

<text>Wow, I’ve heard a lot of good things about this nursery but when I called and asked for availability of fruit trees I got really bad customer service over the phone, it’s like the employees don’t have any training on phone etiquettes.

We had a lot of questions, especially since hardly anything has labels or descriptions. But if you get staff help, they are super friendly and knowledgable and are willing to go above and beyond to help- especially Mark. He thanked us up and down for purchasing plants from there after providing great customer service. They have a lot of variety and comparable pricing. We found a lot of what we needed for full back and front landscaping. Beautiful to just walk around, full view of mountains.</review>

<resp>None<//resp><Text>I ordered their topsoil which is advertised as a "clean sandy loam".  What they delivered was pure sand with nearly no trace of silt or clay which would make it a loam.  The driver gave me NO opportunity to inspect the product before dumping it and just driving away.

I called and they put "the manager" on the line, who proceeded to tell me that he had taken my order and that he had told me they were out of sandy loam and they had something similar.  I told him that no one told me anything of the sort, and that he must have me confused with someone else.  He took my information and said he would call me back.

After not receiving a call back, I called again, and I was told the manager was unavailable.  I little while later the guy who actually had taken my order called me back and told me that what was delivered is their topsoil and all that means is there are no rocks.  I explained to him that it was advertised as sandy loam, but what was delivered was just plain sand.  He told me that he'd speak to the owner of the company.  He called back a little while later and told me that the owner wouldn't do anything about it.

I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau.  They never bothered to send someone to verify that they delivered the correct product, yet they insisted on being combative and blaming the customer.  Rather than making any attempt to fix the problem they've been insulting, and have lied about things they say they told me and responses I supposedly gave them.<//Text><gmapID>0x80dccaa34fce8f1b:0x1f741b9a0e861a81</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Bought 100 sq ft of their recommended planter mix even though it seemed very course ,they claimed it was perfect for my organic garden. Vegtables grew small and even after adding compost and nutrient's produced poor results . On further inspection I was finding a large amount of ground up metal, painted wood, plastic, and what looked to be fiberglass !! I contacted sunshine grows and sent pictures, they also found the same debris in their mix. I was promised by the manager the owners would call me,no call ever. They continue you ignore my emails and owners apparently dont care. I glad, I found Thompson building materials,they sell  their plants at 1/3 the price of sunshine.</Text>

I had placed the order on Tuesday and was told we are the 2nd delivery for the day, it would be on site at 10 AM. I called on Friday the day of delivery at 10 AM to check status and I was the next truck to load and it should be there by noon. I called at noon and was told another hour, I asked for the manager and was told he was out to lunch and his name is Oliver. I called at 1245 and spoke to accounting assuming I was getting the run around and well dont ya know there is not even an oliver who works there let alone the manager. I began to explain my situation and the fact I have people waiting to take care of the delivery once it is dropped and the woman on the other side of the phone began to cut me off, I asked her to please let me finish at least getting through my side and she said she was trying to help but there was nothing that could be done, I asked if I was the 2nd delivery of the day why is it now going to be close to 2 PM, she said they only have 1 truck that does this delivery- Only 1 truck I asked? she said no they have plenty of trucks but only 1 for mulch. Long story short I have used them for years prior but will not be going back and will advise all of my neighbors who are doing large jobs on their yards to use another vendor.<//Text>

Expect to wait in line a long time. No plant guarantee like HD or Lowe’s.

< Review>
Half of the plants that we bought died in less than a month. We followed their advice on what soil amendments to use and how to transplant and water the new plants, however all of the plants died.
To add insult to injury, we paid $75 for an avocado plant that literally died in 3 days but Sunshine Growers would not refund or give us a new plant.
So if you'd like to waste money, then buy their plants and their products to help grow the plant and then watch all of them die, please go to Sunshine Growers.</Review>

<Rate>1</Rate><review>(Translated by Google) I bought a small avocado at $ 15 (good price), but weeks later it died slowly. I know about avocados and I know that the cause was a disease that forcibly must have left the nursery of origin. I went back to the nursery to ask them about my problem and they told me they were sorry but they did not make refunds or discounts at another plant.
The cheap is expensive. BEWARE of this place.

(Original)
Compré un aguacate chico en $15 (buen precio), pero semanas después murió lentamente. Conozco de aguacates y sé que la causa fue una enfermedad que forzozamente debió de haber salido del vivero de origen. Regresé a la 'nursery' a plantearles mi problema y me dijeron que lo sentían pero no hacían reembolsos ni descuentos en otra planta.
Lo barato sale caro. CUIDADO con este lugar.</review>< pics>

<Review>As the customer, we had to explain the products to the representative. For example, they were not aware of what colors were available for what phones and we the customer had to look at their tablet to explain to them what was available and why. They also continued to pick the wrong product several times, before eventually ordering the proper product but let us know that they had accidentally ordered the incorrect one. However, this proved to be completely incorrect and they had in fact ordered the right one. The whole process was very frustrating and took nearly two hours. The extent of inexperience and lack in knowledge nearly led us to call for another representative.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<Text>Dennis store manager was excellent. He went above and beyond my expectations. He got me in and out in a timely manner. Addressed all my
concerns and was very knowledgeable and more importantly, kind and patient. It was a pleasure working with Dennis, I hope all reps are as patient and social as Dennis.</Text></record>

Fabian was a tremendous help to me and my family when we were trying to figure out our options for upgrading our phones. In the recent past, I’ve had some very frustrating experiences with AT&T customer service so I was really dreading going into the store. Fabian was truly excellent though. He was so knowledgeable, thorough, and patient. Thank you Fabian for your outstanding customer service!</review>

Not even talking to their so called manager Jessica did half the job he did (she lacks all the qualities that a manager should hold, please do re train her or have her learn from her colleagues). Fabian truly deserves some recognition for his hard work, customer service, and overall helpful individual. You don’t encounter many that actually do what they say will be done. Jake as a manager helpful and very understanding. Thank you both Fabian and Jake, keep up the amazing work.</review>< Pics>

<name>Sheree Swan<//name><review>Literally the worst I've ever dealt with, both the store and the company. Orders were mixed up, shipped to wrong addresses, and there is no communication between departments. Everything every employee whether in store or on the phone I talked to gave false information and or had no true understanding of the products they were selling. To top it all off the store manager is a true douche canoe who sits in the backon a computer refusing to be of any real help.<//review></record>

My experience at the AT&T Store on Gellert in Daly City was exceptional. I was greeted immediately and provided service that is rare to find during these unpredictable times.  Fabian did an excellent job listening to my needs and providing me the perfect phone and wireless plan.  I have been a loyal AT&T customer for decades, and my time visiting the team in this store validates even more for me why. Keep up the great service!< /review>

<text>AT&T Internet and TV service is top of the line. They took care of everything regarding the activation of my accounts.  Several months later, when I had a billing issue, I went to the Serramonte AT&T store and spoke with Emad. He was great. He took the time to fix a billing issue with a successful result. I highly recommend going to the Serramonte AT&T store.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

I just have to say that I’m really impressed with the customer service that I received. Andrew the manager helped me with my bill credits for the internet and tv I recently signed up for. Andrew is very knowledgeable when it comes to everything AT&T. Will definitely be coming back and will recommend my family and friends in the future!!</text>

We went back to the store  and we see a two young ladies standing inside the store and waiting and the same guy saw us again and ask my husbands number and he said we are next and he told us to get out of the store again and we'll call you .  We have gone out of the store but didn't go back to car since it's really raining hard.  We just stand in front of the store trying to find some cover from the rain.  While standing in front of the store the two young lady is still inside waiting.  Then the same guy called them and started their appointment.  So we went back to inside since there's no one standing inside anymore.  so we tried to get inside again since it will be our turn next.  The rude guy kick us out again saying we cant stay but how come the two young ladies he let them stay and wait.  We were so mad and left.</text>< pictures>

<Review>I was very impressed with the careful and attentive service provided at AT&T by Retail Sales Consultant, Benito Jimenez.  He quickly took the time to understand why I came in.  I was following up regarding warranty on a Pelican case, since one of the rubber flap covers on my case was starting to tear.  Benito is excellent and provided some great insights regarding the quality of the case, Pelican case benefits,  other quality alternative brand cases  and how easy it was to activate the Pelican warranty.  If you want to work with an outstanding service partner with great service skills be sure to ask for Benito.</Review>< Rating>

Joan S. is one of the best customer service reps I have ever encountered at an AT&T store. She was very detailed and patient. She took the time to research our account and gave us a very informative break down of the account. She displays the kind of customer care that makes you want to return to the store for any of your phone needs. She is friendly and very welcoming. She is the very reason why I am continuing to be a loyal customer of AT&T. She is to be recognized for her hard work and dedication. AT&T is very fortunate to have her as an employee. She deserves to be a manager for the type of work and care she has for the customers. Thank you Joan for all your help!! We need more people like you!</text>

Switched over from Sprint to AT&T. Forgot the name of the representative, but he was very kind and helped me throughout the process. Made me feel very informed about my decision of switching over, what to expect and how my service should be from now on. this interaction really set the bar for AT&T and i am happy with my now carrier.</text>

Dean is life saver! I was suicidal when I arrived going on 12 hours without a phone. He calmed my nerves and also helped me upgrade my phone and get the apple watch I'd be eyeing for months. He totally made my day and I left a very happy customer! I will be back for any other needs. Thanks again Dean!</Review>

<Review>Albert is an awesome representative. He was able to get me in and out quickly. Reviewed my account and offered me some really good promotions. My only issue is with my interaction yesterday. I was told I wasn’t able to switch and tablet to a phone line when in fact you can. I had this completed in a few minutes over the phone. The manager Dennis wasn’t helpful at all. His actions and mannerisms made me feel like I was a nuisance. What was worse is when I explained it is possible he brushed me off. It’s unfortunate that you have great representatives like Alberto but subpar managers like Dennis. Being a sales rep/manager for AT&T for 8 years then becoming a consumer and having to deal with a manager who was unwilling to help because he it was a service rather than a sale is extremely disappointing. The reason why I gave this review a 5 star rather than a one is I don’t want Alberto to pay for his managers mistakes.<//Review>< Pics>

<review>So two weeks ago I switch with AT&T
So I have to trade in my phone to the store so the store manager his name is (Jake) he told me you don’t need to wait in line when you gonna come back to trade in the phone.
So I went to time’s to do it and every time they told me I have to wait in line for 30 minutes!! But I can’t so I left!
So today I want to trade in my phone and I saw the store manager (jake) and  he told me you have to wait in line for 30-45 minutes and the way how he said it he was really disrespectful.
I don’t know how he became a store manager if he can’t do what he say’s to the customer</review>< Pictures>

Just left this location after being helped by Benito! He was a god send my current phone is broken and he sat there so attentively helping me figure out all my options for getting a new phone. He also was nice enough to help me with ATT business plans because I am a business owner and I wanted to open a business account with ATT. All and all I had a great experience especially during this holiday season when everything is hectic. Will definitely be looking into working with him in the future whenever I need to add a line or anything ATT related!</Text>

<text>Had an ongoing issue for a year, Fabian, jake and Rory were the only ones to take action to help me out. Super professional with everything and went above and beyond to get this issue resolved. Overall they did amazing, the only down fall was one manager whom I believe her name is Jessica, did poorly with help. I was told she would keep me updated with emails but did not receive anything at all and made things get complicated more than they already were. Thanks to the guys for all their help!< /text>< pics>

<text>Nhielle is an absolute gem. She was very nice and super patient as I asked her a barrage of questions regarding which phone to upgrade to.

Payne might be the best rep I have ever dealt with at at&t, I have been a customer for many many years. You will be hard pressed as an organization to keep a talent like him, pleasant, knowledgeable I could go on. You know what an asset you have in him.

<Review>My experience was fantastic at the Gellert Blvd AT&T location! Nbeel was amazing! He was so helpful and knowledgeable. Luckily, during my visit I was able to change carriers from T-Mobile to AT&T. Nbeel explained what my plan consisted of and provided a break down of how much I would be paying in store and monthly. He also explained each perk and what my plan has to offer! I was very satisfied with his customer service and would recommend anyone to visit this location! Everyone is friendly and they are there to help you with all your needs! I love AT&T already! :)< /Review>< resp>

I was so happy with my experience at the AT&T store yesterday!  I was waited on in a professional and courteous manner and the sales rep went out of his way to ensure I received excellent customer service. On top of that, I was a mess after losing my phone and he was very understanding and incredibly patient during the entire process. I couldn’t be happier about my experience and had to share it!< /Review>

<Review>Jessica W. Is absolutely amazing!!!

With this being said I would like to share my experience...I do not believe in yelp, online reviews or verbal accolades but because of this experience I had to shout it from the rooftops.

It is because of her attention to detail, her willingness to take customer service to a completely different level and her knowledge that I will stay a loyal customer of AT&T.

When Apple “Support” completely dismissed me, Jessica single handily took the time, energy and dedication to resolve my issues with my new product. She did not give up when she couldn’t immediately find an answer...she persisted that there was a solution.

I was given the poorest excuses from Apple and was told the same thing from multiple “customer service” support representatives...Jessica ran circles around the entire Apple experience and she solved my problem...which I was told by Apple couldn’t be solved by them & I would have to go to an outsourced third party & pay for out of my own pocket.

Jessica W went above and beyond her job and her “requirements”. I will be a loyal customer to wherever Jessica will be employed. Thank you for turning my mess into a great experience that got resolved!!!</Review>< pictures>

Jessica and Benito were ABSOLUTELY PHENOMENAL. I'd give them 10 stars. Solved problems. Gave me multiple solution options to take care of an issue created, walked in a little flustered, walked out in a mood 100% better and with an idea of what was to come. I generally have good trips to this Daly City location, but this by far was the top.</Text>

I came to this store for some questions about my stolen earbuds. Dean was the one who helped me and explain things in detailed. I end up with new earbuds and more. But boy, I had an excellent service from Dean. Have more employees like Dean and your store will be top notch.<//Review>

I just went and was treated absolutely poorly by the staff, specifically Benito. Not only was he condescending to my mother, but he was also incredibly lazy and unhelpful. He did not provide any information and furthermore acted like a baby when a phone was “thrown at him”. In actuality, it was slid across the table. I hope he gets fired for being incredibly unprofessional and downright disrespectful. Don’t use this store as you won’t get any help as they are doing the absolute bare minimum (it might just be Benito, but if that is allowed, then I can’t expect anything different from the other employees there). After pretending to be helpful a week ago, he went into incompetent mode and acted like an absolute jerk. I will be calling into their corporate group and lodging a formal complaint against this store and employee.< /review>

<text>The phone number on Google didn't work (at the time of this posting), but this location is very much open and busy. There's a nice, cafe-style waiting/lounge area and you can expect to be there a while because there's at least 2 people ahead of you. The tables have outlets to charge up, too. Service was friendly and knowledgeable, but again a bit delayed by the volume of people.< /text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<Text>I hate to do this... but Nhielle Q plays people!! I came in to this AT&T store and told Nhielle Q that my phone was broken and asked her what were my options. She looked up my account and saw that I was eligible for an upgrade and that I should get a new phone. She never told me that I could claim my old phone through the AT&T insurance, but instead sold me a new phone.I asked her if I needed to keep paying off the old phone even if the phone is not working and she said no that you would start  with a new plan. I told the  manger at this location Serramonte AT&T Jake, about my situation with Nhielle Q. He wasn’t  really any help because he said that it was already too late  to do anything. It was a few months later when I found out. Nhielle Q even told me to set up auto pay and that I would get $10 dollars off each month off my bill for having this set up and not even that was true.. I can say that I do thank Ronn who was very patient and courteous and helped me  reduce my bill. I think that Jake the manager at this location and Nhielle Q are best friends or something because when I explained to him about my situation he basically thought I was lying! Ridiculous!!!!  that AT&T associates play there customers in order to sell there products and get commission!<//Text><Rating>1<//Rating>< pictures>

This place sucks and need to wait for long time even when it is not  busy. There are not enough employees to help the customers. I wouldnt recommend to this place for anyone. We almost waited for an hour and none turned up to help. Also tried to take appointment before reaching the store by calling but the store representative herself confirmed that they would never respond for the store calls. I would have given 0 if available.< /text>

As a non American it's weird how something so simple has to be so complicated. Just buying a prepaid and you have to make a reservation and let them know your whole life story. They work on commission too and as such they refused to give us staff discount when our friend who work for the company asked. They just ignored the question. Other than that it was ok. It's the best network in the states for Europeans, so not much of a choice there, which is strange for being America.< /review>

Upon walking in you'll be greeted and set up in line. Your place in line is displayed on a monitor on the back wall. If you can help it, I recommend making an appointment first since the walk in line is slow to move.< /text>< pictures>

< Review>
Went in for a simple task. Give me a phone line. Everything was set up, just one line, with unlimited everything. The woman helping me made some sort of mistake, and came back saying that the plan I wanted, which I was happy to pay the full amount for, would be discounted. Great!

That was a big lie. She had put me on a multi line plan, which doubled the initial cost, and then the whole plan cost more than was advertised! No one on the phone wanted to honor the price I was discussed in the store. Guess I'll have to walk in and see if they'll honor their word at the store, or if I will have to take other actions to get AT&T to pull their head out of their you know what.</Review>

<Rating>4< /Rating><Review>So I accidentally left the box of my phone here and I had to get it later, but I called first to ask if they still had it... I think since they're a cell service company they probably could have notified me (as they had my number on file), but they had found it and kept it safe. And the service besides that was pretty helpful. I went on a weekday so there wasn't as much of a wait.</Review><user_id>107200744319243192802< /user_id>< resp>

Great service ! I had gone to 2 other stores prior to this one in hopes that I wouldn’t have to wait an hour to be seen, and I was immediately helped even though it was busy. Milka was very quick to help me purchase my iWatch and she was super friendly!! Answered all my questions and even helped set up my watch. Definitely my choice of location for an AT&T.</review>

You do have a long wait to get help for whatever reason your their, but the employee's are all very nice and have a lot of knowledge when dealing with smartphones.  Also plenty of parking due to other stores in the area.  Just wish they had more help then there would be less waiting.</Text>

We came in yesterday afternoon around 4 (09/22/18) to pick up an order placed online, we had a confirmation that the phone was ready for pick. When we got there the employee who greeted us was tall and right away said that the wait can take up to 4 hours and was suggested to come back before closing because they don't do appointment schedules. So I drove to the store right before closing and turned me away saying the  online order system aren't working which they could have told us that at the beginning and the gentlemen helped me this time set up my appointment for the next day at 9 am. I was very unhappy with the service  here at this particular location. I do not recommend to get some service here.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

Everytime I've been here it's been a positive experience, I've been able to complete my businesses and with the help of the associates that work here it's been very smooth.
Be willing to wait for the assistance of a representative, but it's worth it since you will get the attention needed to complete your business.<//Review>

The AT&T customer experience at their local stores really invites current and potential customs to seek out  other carriers to be their wireless service provider. Case in point. I came in for a few spare SIM cards in order to take them with me when checking out some other devices to ensure AT&T service works on the devices. AT&T representatives , both the floor person and the store manager, flat out refused to give me any spare SIM cards without activating the SIM cards on my account. However, activating a SIM card against my phone and my account would cause the deactivation of my current SIM card residing in my phone. The surprising thing? Just a short while ago after the first of the year I came into the same location and ask for the same thing in order to check out another device. The same store with the had no problem at that time providing a spare SIM card. The story the manager at this store gazing for not providing SIM card was two things. First he said that policy has stopped any store from giving spare unactivated SIM cards to their customers. Secondly he says that customer service can no longer activate a phone using a spare SIM card. I definitely know this is false due to my recent activities in utilizing the previously picked up spare SIM cards to test AT&T service on some other phones I was considering to purchase. So AT&T service at the AT&T store locations is unsatisfactory for several reasons. The representatives in the AT&T stores do not know what they're talking about when speaking to the customer service aspect of their offering. Store managers are not given the leeway to provide the tools necessary to retain current current customers.  I didn't offer an alternative solution of temporarily adding an uncharged number to the account with one of the SIM cards activated. AT&T refused to accommodate my request.<//Text>

I made two appointments over a three week period and was disappointed both times.  This was the new store at 305 Gellert Blvd, Daly City, CA 94015.  The first visit was to upgrade 2 phones and the second visit was to upgrade a 3rd phone.  So I am not such a bad customer?  However, I do take notes and I do ask for clarification for the pricing.  Each visit, I was misquoted the price.  What they say I'll pay and what I have to pay are never the same amounts.  Both visits the person speaking to me has to go into the back room to clarify the pricing....(reminds me of buying a used car).  The 2nd visit my support person was Ryan, an individual placed in some level of management at the store was still going back to get clarification...from whom - the great OZ?  Every time I asked a question or asked him to clarify, Ryan interrupted my questions and would start with really aggressive tactics and confrontational language.  Personally I just wanted to get myself out of a personally uncomfortable situation.  My suggestion is GO TO A DIFFERENT STORE or expect to pay more.<//Text>

The employees here are such dishonest people. The employee said the wait list would only take two hours. After waiting for two and a half hours, they literally said it will take another three hours. Stop wasting everyone's time and tell us how long we actually have to wait so we can schedule an appointment and leave. I can also see reviews of people complaining about their employee's uprightness, I'm not surprised...

< Review>
Came in with a copy of the check amount they said I owed on my account. I guess that was not enough information showing the cashed check & the back of the check showing A T & T wells Fargo account # pay to the order of. So I just pay them again & also the late of fee of $9.25
I will find another company to bundle my phone internet & tv.
The problem is it will probably be worse. LOL</Review>

Probably the worst i experience from ATT store.  The "greeter" (an asian girl..Think her name was Carol  cuz thats what the name tag said... not like she introduced herself) seemed very uninterested and seemed irritated that I took her away from her phone.  With my luck, she was the one that helped me.  Still seemed very un-interested and irritated and asked me what i wanted.  Said an I-phone 8 plus.  (Not even a Hello or how are you?) She asked me, "what color".  I said, "what color does it come in".  She takes a deep breath and gives that look of, "you should know.  Why you asking".  She gives me the colors and just with her demeanor and attitude, i decided to leave and not give her the sale.  For Christ sake, I'm about to spend $1000 bucks.  At least she can have some good customer service.  Don't make it seem like I'm inconveniencing you because i'm having you do "your" job.  So I decided to go home and do my business over the ATT website which was outstanding!!!  (I really recommend this!!!) I will probably never step foot into the Gellert ATT store again and would never recommend it to anyone.<//Text>

<Text>Recently came with my boyfriend to go get him a Samsung 8S. The guy told us it was the best on the market so far and that there were no glitches. However a week later his phone stopped working and completely shut off. When he went back to get an exchange for an actually working phone they told him he had to pay a restocking fee  of 42$ for a phone THEY provided that was faulty. Their reasoning behind it was that because they were a privately owned retailer we had to do things through Samsung otherwise we had to pay. To me this thinking made no sense considering they were the ones that provided the phone. Similarly they provided NO information as to how to go about talking to Samsung or how long it would take to do so. I DO NOT recommend going here considering that if there are ever issues with the phones the employees WILL NOT help you and they basically say you're on you own not there problem. It's better to go through and actual AT&T store where they told us had we bought it through them they would've just given us a new phone in replacement for the faulty one.<//Text><gmapID>0x808f7becb858ecf1:0x8fda6429d3ee60e8<//gmapID></record>

<review>Bought a phone 48 hours ago. It never actually worked. It was clearly a hardware problem and I just requested to exchange the phone for the same model, color, GB. Manager Edgar said he could waive the $45 restocking fee but he "wasn't going to" (I'm assuming his little man syndrome was to blame, or perhaps his mother didn't love him enough as a child). I explained that I am traveling home for xmas tomorrow and there is no apple store under a 2 hour drive. I asked him to do me a favor and wave it. Simple right? Not for Edgar, he giggled "because he was full from lunch" and disappeared to the back room to presumably purchase male enhancement pills via his working iPhone. Called corporate, they disagreed with him and credited my account. I hope those pills work out Edgar, because we're all sick of you over compensating your lack of manhood :)

p.s. It was a hardware issue and my new phone is working great. Pretty sure they were going to "restock" my broken one so beware of getting your phones here!<//review><Name>Lauren Loncar</Name>< Rating>

<text>Worst possible outcome ever! Don't ever go to that place if you don't want to be deceived. Those people are very dishonest and will give you one quote to attract, and then trap you into something else. I'm not erasing my previous review just to show the drastic contrast between expectation and reality, just updating it. Here is my story. I walked into this store( I wish I never did), just to find out what's the quote for  3 lines was. I told  them that I had 3 lines with Verizon and was paying around 170-180$ a month. I'm a dental student, which means I'm on budget. I was interested In finding  a better deal. Justin and Chris quoted me for three lines and told me that I can get IPhone 7 Plus for myself, connect my existing Iphone 6 plus for my Mom, and get one of Samsung phones for my kid for the same 170$ which will include 24months payment plan for the new iPhone, and after I pay it off, my bill will be about 145$. Guess what - they lied. Cynically and deliberately. They gave "all possible deals and credits" and I have copy of my contract.  I asked FEW times what my bill will be, and the response was 170$. Guess what - first bill came in the amount of 280$. I called ATT customer service and explained situation, and they told me that those are prorated charges because the billing period started 3 days after getting the service, and because of those 3 days they charge you more. I went to the store and made the payment, and was told that next bill will be regular charge. Today I got it - 220$. Called the store - and guess what - the store manager Chris started telling stories about that everything is correct and those are tax charges. I asked him "Didn't  you guys tell me when I signed the contract that the bill will be around 170$? And when I came with the 280$ charge, didn't you tell me that it's the first bill only, and the next one will be as promised?" And now you telling me that 50$ difference is taxes? Come on, are illiterate, or what? Or you take me for an idiot? You can't count? How much is 170$+ tax? I'm so disgusted with those liars! Don't ever go there! They are either not competent and don't know how to count or they are just cynical crooks that do foul business. Either is unacceptable. I wonder if that's the philosophy of ATT to deceive people or it's just incompetence of certain people who are ruining the reputation of the company they work for. I was offended to the core by the way they treat customers, first very nice to trap you into signing the contract, and then when you catch them on hot, they just tell you that this is how it is. I am a medical professional  which means I'm quite educated and those "smarties" were able to outsmart me like a kindergartener just because I trusted the name of the company that they represented. So now I'm so insulted that I want to pay the full cost of my device and run away. And I will do my best to share this awful experience with my colleagues and dental student classmates so that nobody ever gets robbed. That's a daylight robbery, and if after reading all this you are risky enough to deal with those people, make sure you audio RECORD the fairy-tale discount stories and quotes, so that you have a proof of what you were told. Otherwise, you will be another victim of dishonesty. I'm so mad that can't wait for tomorrow morning to call customer service and see what my options are. Never, never, never go to that place. I despise dishonesty, and now it's a matter of principle to spread the word. I'm a very busy person, but I took time to write all this, because I don't want other people to feel like me now.</text>< pictures>

I don't love ATT, but I've had good experiences at this store - when something goes wrong, they have been helpful resolving the problem. I'm sure it depends on the rep you talk to, but I've been very lucky here so far.< /Text>

I am writing the review with ABSOLUTELY NO  BIAS.

No matter how bad experience I have, I don't like to write review for anything.  However; with experience with this store, I can't resist. And obviously this is my very first review.

On Friday,  May 29th, 2015 at 6:21pm, I checked in with Ryan the store manager.  Waiting for exactly 1 hours 43 minutes to be called.  The first thing I told the sale rep that I  lost my driver license but I have everything else to prove who I am.  Then he went to chat with his manager, Ryan and he came back said no.  But he let me talk to the manager if his manager can override it.  So I presented all these to Ryan the story mananger

1) My student I.D.
2) My work ID.
3) My City and County ID.
4) My personal checks  with my address on it.
5) My Bank of America ATM card with picture and name one it.
6) My paystub which will show my discount since i worked for the city.
7)My proof of DMV replacement fee to replace my license

He does not even bother to look at these.

NONE OF THESE IDENTIFICATIONS are good enough.  He wants either driver license or Passport.

WOULD ANYONE BRING A PASSPORT TO UPGRADE A PHONE????

Then he said he can accept FOREIGN GOVERNMENT ID.  He can not accept my City and County work ID but he can accept a foreign one??? Is this a joke?? He can not trust his own county but he trust oversea ID?

He, RYAN added, he can not even accept the Fire Department employee ID.  SORRY FIREMAN.  If you loose your driver license or state ID, make sure to bring your PASSPORT when you need to upgrade your phone.

He kept saying that I was there challenging him to get fired from his job if he override it.

Ok...look.  I sat there on a Friday afternoon for almost two hours to challenge him to get fired.  I am here to upgrade my phone.  if you got fired or not is none of my bee wax!  And honestly after this experience i do hope so.

If you know i am talking about you and you need to contact me to remove my review, please do so.  You have my information.  i checked in with you  at 6:21pm.
and you were the manager at that time.< /Text>

<rate>1</rate><Text>My wife tried to exchange my son's phone case we bought along with several phones along with a family service plan on May 1st of last year. The manager ("allen") refused to replace the case because the year warranty expired about two weeks ago (today is the 14th). I originally had Verizon as my carrier and was surprised at how significantly slow the att service was compared to Verizon's service. I went along with the family service plan thinking I would save a few dollars. Well...YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!!!  NOT ONLY IS THE CARRIER SLOW, BUT SO WAS THE CUSTOMER SERVICE...EVEN WORSE!!!. Think for a second.  if you had to even give away tweny-five dollars to keep $400.00+  - $500.00 of monthly revenue from going to a more competent competitor what would you do in this situation? As a salesperson you'd think it would be obvious! As a sales manager ... it's a "NO BRAINER!!". If you're giving away phones that cost more than the case, what's there to think about? Just Sayin'! " Another customer "bites the dust" and "heads to greener pastures!"< /Text>< Pics>

<review>Amazing experience at this place! Walked in and got greeted by the owner Shadi Friday morning before heading down to my friend’s birthday party and I was looking for a really good red wine considering I don’t know much about wine and the owner recommended me a bottle of Caymus.... MY FRIEND LOVED IT!! Thank you I’ll definitely stop by again when I’m in the area! #supportoursmallbusinesses< /review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

Best liquor store I’ve ever been to. It is clean, extremely well organized, and it has an amazing variety of every liquor your heart may desire. The employees are always nice and welcoming as well. Not a bad thing to say about this store.</text>

Of all the liquor stores in Sunland/Tujuga, this is by far the cleanest, most organized store I've been into.  They have a huge selection of High-End Spirits, as well as having a great selection of Craft Beers.  They're prices are very competive, and their Beer is THE Coldest you'll find anywhere.  Awesome Place !<//Review>

<Response>{'time': 1509380876040, 'text': "Rude people??  I've had the same employees working for me for over 7+ years.  My employees are as honest as they come, and not only that, but they understand that customer service is our TOP priority when it comes to our customers.   I don't know where this disgruntled customer is coming from, or what happened, but I can assure you that any rudeness from ANY one of my employees results in termination.  PERIOD.  This review is completely fabricated and made up, and i will not stand for it.  This is hatred towards my business and my livelihood."}< /Response><review>Very rude people.  Prices are average but I will not be coming back just because of the service.  There are many other liquor stores in the area don't bother giving your money to these people!</review></record>

<name>Eduardo Hernández, Jr</name><Time>1592706901560<//Time><rate>4</rate><Review>First time going to a restaurant since the COVID-19 outbreak in the region. It was a little disappointing that there weren't many Staff available, so it was very slow service at the beginning, then it got much better. Food and drinks were real good. Seating was available at safe distances (some booths were flagged unavailable with red cords around them). Cazuela cocktail was delicious, the House Margarita not so much, had to mix them and it was pretty good.</Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP7cnihqzFcl9t41RA3WU8ehdFlLj364ed8u0BX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNXvCehUNhx4fg00Bgs6DkZ6Gxuf_XKjxJrO630=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM4EEo6rIODYdkssi6VZwexArt36sNWrNV1eYCg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPIizrZNFtHic92YUo__yiBiQBTuiOYW_4DJgsm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< response>

This is the first time I come here and I honestly won’t ever come back again. Ever since we walked in and asked to be seated outside the waiter was super rude. While taking our order she was being super rude on answering questions. Also when we got our drinks we got one cup with pink lipstick lips on it, looks like regulations with COVID-19 aren’t being follow. I wish you guys the best, wish there was better service and more careful when it came to dishes being clean.</Review>

We had great service when we visited. Food was good and reasonably priced. Fresh fruit margaritas were great. There is indoor and outdoor dining and plenty of space. This place has changed names and owners so many times over the last decade or two. So many Mexican restaurants in Sonoma. Tough competition. Worth a stop.<//Review>

<text>We went in a few weeks ago, about 5 mins before closing. They were still able to take us in and that in itself speaks volumes. Mind you, we had a group of 6 adults and 5 children. The service was great and the food as well. I really enjoyed visiting this establishment for the first time, and will be a returning guest for the future days.<//text>< pics>

Nice room. Good service. Food is typical Mexican food. My mole was too thick but the rest of the family enjoyed what they ordered. Burritos, enchiladas and a very nice bacon wrapped shrimp served with a healthy portion of guacamole, rice and beans.</text>

<Review>Best Mexican restaurant in Sonoma. We decided to try the latest version of this restaurant last night. It is our new favorite restaurant.
Food was really good, very authentic.  My husband had the mole made with cheese since he is vegetarian.
I had shrimp with a garlic sauce. It was definitely a cut above anything we’ve had in Sonoma and we’ve been to all the Mexican restaurants in town.  Prices were reasonable.
Service was excellent. The music was very nice and the atmosphere was lovely. It was quiet enough that you could talk.
The margaritas were great, best we’ve ever had and huge.
We were there after dark but they do have a big lovely patio.
Give them a try. You will be so happy you did!< /Review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Review>We decided to give this place a chance, since it recently reopened. TERRIBLE. The food alone was totally bland and uninspired. I am from L.A. originally, so I know what good Mexican food tastes like. To make matter worse they got our order wrong FOUR times. That's 4 times we had to send it back! And it was just me and my 7 year old son! There are better options in Sonoma ( I think). Don't go here.< /Review>< user>

This is their third restaurant with the first one being in Cotati and the second one at River Road and Mark West Parkway in Santa Rosa. Product consistency is good between all three restaurants and food quality is excellent every time.  Recommend this restaurant and everything on the menu!<//Text>

The carnitas are amazing ... also the ceviche with pulpo ... if you like spice you can order their pickled onions with habaneros as a side.
This is a family friendly restaurant; there will be children ... which to me is a relief to see ...<//text>

Well, I have a good story 'bout this place: So we had been planning a night out to Mi Ranchito in Sonoma since they opened(a year ago apparently). However-you know about "plans well made"...anyway there was a fire, home purchase and 2 severe family illnesses that literally kept us from Mi Ranchito's front door though we basically went past it more than a few times a day. Go figure! Anyhow knowing we(son&daughter-we live together) would probably never make it at that rate, I decided to take a "bold step of my own" and look up their menu online to see what we had been missing and maybe that would get us down there in shorter order. Guess it worked cuz the menu looked soooooooo good I used the phone number on the web to call in for a pick up order: the gentleman on the phone seemed a bit hesitant as I was ordering—which I chalked off to heavy accents on both parts—me English—he Spanish. But I said thank you after agreeing on a pick up time. Anyway-better cut this short(er)😁Got down there ONLY to find out the menu I used was NOT the Sonoma Restaurant's and virtually nothing was done. But we got it squared away. So I sat...and I sat.. BUT within 10 minutes I was handed a brown shopping bag and a receipt to sign and I left with goodies in hand(oh no he helped me to my car as I use a cane)and I was off to my home. Let me tell you that bag smelled soooooooo good it was difficult to drive home. Well we put it on plates and were completely blown away-AWESOME!!! After the first bite we ALL were simply BLOWN AWAY! Absolutely the very BEST Mexican-American food known to man! Cold, Hot or in-between simply the BEST! Thank you Mi Ranchito for a decision well made. Forget the plans and GO!!!< /text>

<Text>This is the 1st time in over 2 decades that I finally am happy with having to go to the dentist, I love Dr Chopra, he was so good at making sure I felt no pain and I appreciated that he also was focused on saving my teeth instead of pulling them, like so many of my ‘past dentists’..
I am very grateful! I also want to say he has a Great Assistant Angie!
And as a matter of fact the whole office staff is Great!
Thanks Liz, Mayra and Sandra
I love my Western Dental @ 5200 Stockton Blvd. Sacramento CA!<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>{'time': 1625106523391, 'text': "This is great news!

<Text>Thank you so much to Hilda and Leslie! Hilda was amazing at explaining everything as she did the cleaning and made me feel super comfortable as she explained what she was doing with the tools as she was cleaning. They both were very kind and super quick! The staff was very friendly and provided me with A LOT of information. If you do stop by at this dentistry ask for Hilda she will take good care of you!< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Absolutely love the service at  Dental.  They have the best staff!   Ms. Ebony took care of all my questions and concerns from the minute I walked in.  I was super nervous because I hate having dental work done.  But after meeting with Ms. Ebony, I felt more at ease and comfortable with taking the next steps.  Ms. Ebony is great at what she does, it’s a tough job to get me to sit still in a dentist office.  If you have any questions or fears, ask for Ebony!!!  I appreciate the great hospitality.  Overall, customer experience was excellent!   Not to mention, the prices and payment plans are super reasonable.   Thank you so much Brident team!  You are appreciated!!!< /Review>< pictures>

<Review>I came to Western Dental today for a dental emergency in a lot of pain. I'm a single mom of 5 so I haven't made time to take care of my own teeth for several years....Jeremiah took care of my X-rays. He was very friendly and made sure I was comfortable. Leslie was awesome helping me with finance options so I was able to get the treatment I needed. Dr. Marshall was amazing! She made the experience comfortable & had a fun sense of humor. Thea the dental assistant was so kind and professional. No one likes going to the dentist, but these wonderful people made my experience a very good one!!!! Thank you all!!!! 😊💗</Review>< date>

I've had two visits so far for dental work and it's the first time in my life that I had such a pain-free experience like this. Dr. Arora is a very skilled professional. I feel that I am in good hands being treated by her. And she explains everything she is doing and puts it in simple terms. I really appreciate being able to get her as my new dentist.<//review>

<text>This place gets 1,000 stars. My son is fearful of the dentist all 8 years of his life & has always gone there. They’ve always done their best to make him comfortable and do a great job cleaning.
We got a cleaning today & the staff is super friendly and accommodating to my son as always. Thank you for always doing an outstanding job!</text>< Date>

< Review>
The doctor I had today was absolutely amazing! She was so kind and she took so much extra time with me and went the extra mile. She also is helping me fix and clear up things with my insurance because they denied a root canal that clearly needs to be done. Also while she was working on me she was so kind, patient and gentle. I don’t do well with dental work, yet she was able to make me feel calm and at ease. I truly appreciate everything she did for me today!< /Review>

My visit was professional and enjoyable especially since going to the dentist is not a favorite thing.  I would like to give a special thank you for Erica G. for her great work with me. She made sure I was never nervous. Overall the appointments went very well.

Thank you.

<Text>I came in today for a quick oral exam and Jeremiah was the dental assistant that helped me out today. He was so friendly and calm during the whole process which made me feel at ease with everything. He conducted X-rays today and he made sure I wasn’t experiencing any discomfort during the process which I appreciate. He explained what he was doing as he was doing it and made this appointment very smooth and easy for me.< /Text></record>

This office for western dental is the best. they treat you with curtesy. they helped me out with everything I needed.  Daniel Kim, did my root canal, he is the best! from general side, they helped me out a lot. There nice and they talk to you as you known them for years. For my braces I met victor,  he was funny and he knew what he was doing. kept telling me what he was doing and helped me not be so tense.< /Review>

I'm not a fan of the dentist but Shiva and the good doctor at the Corona office took good care of me today. Made me feel comfortable,  and with minimal pain. I can't wait to get back to get the rest of this work done. If I had folks like this from the beginning I would have never felt embarrassed and ashamed to go see them resulting in less work and less money needed.  All my fault, but with these people and the comfortable setting they provided ill be back when I'm supposed to. Never felt this comfortable with any dental provider!</Text>

< Review>
I am glad to report my Western Dental experience at 2901 E. Broadway in Tucson, Az.was a good one.  All the staff and people at Western Dental were courteous, professional and helpful.  I want to particularly acknowledge my dentist, Dr. Sloan.  He pulled two teeth and made a lower denture for me and also relined my upper denture and lower denture.  Dr. Sloan was considerate and very good in all his work.  So I am very appreciative and thankful for Western Dental and their people.  BY Gerald Erikson on March 17,2021.</Review>

First of all, kudos to Tech Chris Wilson who took my X RAYS. I'm not a great patient when it comes to that, but Chris was very patient with me and made it a tolerable experience.  Chris also assisted with my tooth extraction (I believe his first one ) and did a wonderful job. The staff is very friendly. The only thing I had a problem with was scheduling me for a 9 o'clock appointment when they open at nine. I had to wait awhile to get on to see anyone. Seems to me they should open earlier to get patients in near the time of their appointment. Other than that, no concerns.< /Text>

They are very nice here ! My first time in I was nervous and embarrassed but the lady made me feel very comfortable. She assured me that I had nothing to worry about or to be embarrassed about and that made me feel better! The receptionist is also very helpful, she worked with me to find the right payment plan which helped a lot.
They also follow all procedures that the pandemic has brought, that also makes me feel safe!</Review>

The place is super clean and staff are very organized.
Dc.Shinali is super professional and caring.
I have been into other clinics and received care from other doctors. Dr.Shinali REALLY knows what she is doing! she is good at explaining things to her patients and she fixed my teeth problems! I am super glad with the service at Western Dental /Chicago Ave branch and I absolutely recommend it .</Review>

<Text>I had a visit with Brident Dental where there appeared to be a misunderstanding on my services to  be rendered...the situation  at the time became very frustrating and upsetting but after calmly speaking with Josephine and listening to her explain the situation things became  clearer .. Dr T. Patel (female) also interacted in the situation at hand  it was confusing  at first but she went high and beyond on getting the situation solved...she had patience...she did not try to blow you off and her explanation was through as well as her assistant Josephine...just wanted to say to Brident Dental that you have to GREAT members on your dental team 😉 Hats off to Dr Patel and Josephine...We need more Dr like Dr T Patel !!</Text><UserId.>107777087588936306667<//UserId.>< username>

There are real people who work at Western Dental and as such people have good days and bad days.  That said, my experiences with Western Dental have been mostly positive with only one negative attitude from an employee whom I dont have any more interactions with. I am very satisfied with the care my local Western Dental professionals have given me. I will go back in two weeks to pick up my upper and lower partials. It's been a long road but worth it.<//review>

< Review>
My grandchild was being bullied because of her smile. Although, she lives in Chicago, I got her braces at WD in downtown Oakland.  I was laid off but got her bill current to resume treatment. Without a text, phone call etc., her appointment was cancelled-after flight and hotel accomodations were made! When she did come in I was scolded and told she would be kicked out of their system if she ever missed an appointment. (Even though I keep her bills paid). Due to a possible Covid exposure I had to reschedule her upcoming appointment. The staff member was so nasty on the phone just because she could be. There has never been any black customer service reps at the front desk even though there waiting room is always filled with black people. To have contempt for the people who pay your bills requires management to reconsider who represents the company.< /Review>

<review>Keith, my 69 year old hygienist today, delivered the most thorough and efficient cleaning I've had in years!

I'm aware I accumulate plaque between cleanings, but I'll bet the past 6 cleanings were not as "thorough" nor as informative.

I admit I do not brush my teeth daily and especially not twice per day! I do Floss, but only when I brush and usually after I brush; which Keith told me to do before brushing.

Keith's instructions for using my Oral-B was the best I've heard (I probably didn't read the instructions).

I hope that my next cleaning is with this professional.

<Text>Horrible corporate office customer service. Not helpful at all. I have not received a bill in the mail since January. Can't even get a statement emailed. Calling doesn't help or resolve the issue. All they keep saying is we can put in a request. They don't let you speak to a supervisor or give you contact information. Do not use this company. Sucks for the office cause they are great.<//Text>< Pictures>

<Rating>1<//Rating><text>I am so disappointed with Western Dental in Rancho Cucamonga. I have had  total extraction of my teeth and am extremely disappointed in the service I have received from WD. The staff give you a cherry hello,  but contrary to the service. I had problems getting pain meds and insisted to immediately wear denials 24 hrs. seven days before gums heal right after extractions that are extremely painful.
The pharmacist even called and was transferred to 5 different offices to get help for me and still could not get help for me in getting pain meds.
The front desk clerk was playing doctor and the dental assistant. They refused to help me get med.
In addition, we keep being asked to get apply for credit check for $30,000 to get work done.  We, my daughter and I understand the packing of cells to help support our gums, but we just don't have the money.
I was given a prescription for medication I'm allergic to and will run up my blood pressure, and heart attack patient. I am a diabetic with several other health issues.
Even when the girl decided to charge us $15, 000 +.
My insurance has a limited income for me to have.
The teeth are horrible and rough.  To they don't fit. They didn't fit the day of extraction.  They hurt.
This is such a disaster and somebody needs to stop this craziness.
We have been going to Western Dental for a bit, and it doesn't seem to be getting any better.<//text>< Pictures>

<text>I have gone to several otrho places for consults for braces for my son. My friend referred me to this dental office and I am very pleased with the service. The office staff is so friendly and the ortho doctor is very knowledgeable and was so kind to my son. So glad we're at Western Dental Corona office.

The only reason for the 4 stars is I'm going to wait to see what our visits will be like in terms of wait time for the ortho. Hoping they are on schedule with appointments as many in the Eastvale area, the wait is usually 30 to 40 mins after you check in for your appt at a certain time.</text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x80dcd9cf94ada39d:0xf3893975db941c22< /gmap_id></record>

<Text>Wonderful professional people that take their time and make you feel Important. Wonder dr. B, she takes her time and very gentle and make sure she does the best work she could do for you. And Jeff was as wonderful making sure sure all of your paperwork was sent out professionally. I feel I had the best consultation and thorough examination.

The worst company to every  handle business. The customer service representatives are very rude and will not allow you to speak with a supervisor. I have requested numerous times a paid in full letter and I have gotten several excuses and lies. I had the same issues getting monthly statements. Mr. Daniel the CEO should have his staff retrained on etiquette, professionalism, and accuracy. I will make sure to informed my family and friends to never use this service.<//Review>

<text>The absolute WORST run organization I have EVER encountered. I went to this business because I was in pain and I could get an appt. quickly, now I know why. I needed a root canal ,per Western Dental, they told me they will have someone there that can do in A MONTH, and also he is not board certified, or I could get a referral to a specialist so I could get it taken care of sooner. I went that option. Well, the joke is on me. They did not send the referral. I waited 2 weeks then finally called. The office either doesn't answer the phone, or puts you on hold for 30min or more , then says (this happened a few times) you need to wait for corporate to respond. I have called corporate and emailed corporate several times this week. Corporate routes me back to this horrible office and the office offers no help.
THIS IS MADNESS!
AVOID THIS BUSINESS AT ALL COST!<//text>< Date>

I've been coming to Western Dental for many years and I've had several procedures done. I like how efficiently I get checked in and know that they have my dental history available and ready when I walk in. Now with Covid - 19 precautionary safety protocols I feel I can go to my dental appointments and feel as safe as possible.< /text>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Text>Worst customer service ever. Paid my contract balance in full and they were still charging me monthly, called numerous of times to explain to them and ask them why am I still being charged when I paid my contract balance in full and all I got was attitude and one of them hanging up on me. Instead of wanting to help, all of the employees I’ve spoke to over the phone seemed very annoyed and not understanding at all. I even emailed customer service 2 weeks ago and yet I have not received a single reply back. Last employee I spoke to over the phone gave me an attitude and told me to ignore my billing payments that came in the mail and that everything was good now and that my contract balance should show $0 now and just hung up on me. They should be able to send me my receipt showing my contract balance paid in full, but yet the only thing I have been receiving in the mail is more western dental billing payment that I shouldn’t be getting because I paid my contract in full already. Seems like this issue is not being resolved or taken seriously at all.

update: 8/3/20 called the billing office and spoke to a lady and she was kind and understanding and said my issue has been resolved and that my discount has been applied to my account and that my contract has been closed because it was paid in full and that my contract balance is now showing $0, finally, all this stress, lets just hope I will be getting my paid in full letter and the statement showing my contract balance of $0 in the mail soon because I did not get it in my email when she said she emailed it to me as well.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

<text>I started my dental cleanings after I moved to California . I chose western dental primarily because they were close to my home.
Since I began i have seen 4 different dentists no explanation given. In January I needed a tooth removed and was given a contract for a implant. I paid the uninsured balance on the spot. Thinking that was it. After my wait period for the graft to heal I scheduled an appointment to have the rest of the procedure done. When I arrived no one seemed to know what was i there for they had my scheduled appointment as an emergency check in. Oh and another new dentist. After I was seen by the new dentist.  I was presented with a new contract for impression and crown. My original contract apparently did not include this hum
So I compare this to a contractor installing a set of cabinets then coming back a saying oh my estimate did not include doors or drawers .
When I first asked about my contract before I signed it I was told it was for the entire treatment for this one tooth.
Iam absolutely disgusted with the lack of concern for patients and ther inability to know what is going on with each individual.
The wait times are 1hr to 1.5 hrs after scheduled appointment just to see the dentist not very efficient.
I don't usually post bad comments but felt compelled to do so.
I don't have anything bad to say about the staff as they do there best. I believe that corporate policy is to blame . A contract should include all items necessary from start to finish.
Very disappointed client<//text>< pictures>

Western Dental Palmdale CA office is a new nightmare.
First they ask you to sign about things never discussed or papers never given
Second Had some teeth pulled, had pieces of teeth coming out for months, so my gums weren’t healing. Dentist didn’t extract teeth correctly
Was fitting for partial dentures, which were of such poor quality, after months of readjustments, was told they couldn’t adjust anymore because they would break. Every time they tried to put in upper ones I nearly cried with pain. They just weren’t right. I refused to pay for something I couldn’t use.
Only option was implants, which are costing me a fortune to pay for
I’ve been without teeth for over a year and this office could care less about me as a patient
Do Not Use Western Dental. Seriously Do Not
I have given three complaints to corporate and nit one single follow up , not one.

<Name>Monica Hernandez<//Name><pictures>None<//pictures><Text>western dental has been the worst experience I have ever had. They are not organized, no one knows what they are doing and are not friendly to help you.  I set up auto pay with one rep and the next month all of a sudden I was not set up, when I called the rep he was quick to tell me how I plan to make this payment. Instead of asking me how he can help me! My kid was at the ortho for the appointment and was not going to be seen until this was done.
Previously, when switching offices because we moved counties, they made it completely impossible to transition smoothly. It was phone call after phone call, I think it took about 3 months to finally get settled, but the whole time they were taking payments on auto-pay, but yet they were sending us PAST DUE notices and trying to charge us late fees. I can't and will never recommend western dental!!</Text>< user>

Apparently they get money for upsell rather then doing what is best for a patient ..let alone one in severe pain.  I'd suggest you NOT go here.  Dentist tells you one story.. oral surgeon another story.  Finance gal another.  This is NOT A DENTAL OFFICE LOOKING AFTER THE BEST INTERESTS OF A PATIENT.<//review>

Extreamly poor customer service skills. Even when i asked twice to speak with the Office Manager in a different room, instead of standing in front of other customers while we disagreed, she said nothing but, "I am trying to help you". Never the less, we were not seen for my grandsons braces adjustment. This was on a Saturday. I called after we returnd home, left a message for a Office Manger to call me to talk about this and here it is Monday almost noon and no phone call. Very disapointing.< /Text>

is super nice , sweet and caring for  your comfort in very step of the way during procedure. Also her Assistant Anna is great in assigning the Dr and check up on me. They make you feel at ease so you don’t feel as terrified of the dentist.< /Text>

<review>I am updating my experience this was not a fun experience in the office. Somone asked me to do a comment here so I could get a free whitening kit. This is how they get you to comment.
Then I received no kit and was waiting on a call from office staff for 3 days.
Never received a call and ended up going to my old dentist office and had treatment done there instead.
I won't be  recommending this place in the future.
The doctor at western dental was nice but my treatment was way different than what was recommended by this doctor.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>{'time': 1583788883164, 'text': 'Robin, thank you so much for the wonderful 5-star review!

Worst place ever. No contact for leadership team. Corp office cust serv cant give you balance of bill and or send you one bcuz they claim they virus is keeping them from sending bills. Craziest thing I have ever heard. Finance dept claims they are not western dental so they dont have business license# for you to report their ethics to state board or Calif dental board but the phone was answered  as western dental. Cant see patients due to virus, understandable, but can call everyday about your bill. These people put braces on my grandaughter in Feb and contracted to see her every month. It's been 4 months and eventhough they are closed due to virus, no one has called to even check to see if her teeth have shifted, if wires were broke or loose or anything. Noticeably the virus is not keeping them from calling about the monthly pmt..I feel her bill should be adjusted every month she is unable to get treatment. These ppl are money hungry. They allowed my grandaughter to sign a 4000 bill, 3 weeks after she turned 18, still in high school, with a 6-10  hour a week part time job. Now that's what you call taking advantage of a high schooler. Instead of checking first to see if she had a qualified income to pay this bill, they just ran her credit and  yes her credit was clear  she just turned 18. Western dental is now her first creditor and going to be her first lesson on what it's like to be 18..thanks Western dental! Now that she is off work bcuz of the virus and cant pay the bill they dont understand but we are suppose to understand they have not treated her in four months due to the virus. I feel there is something really shaky here as you cannot speak to anyone above the lowest employee there, customer service. They even have them filling out your complaints. I see all these ppl joining the leadership team but why are they not accessible to people who are paying 4000 bills that need to file complaints. The bad reviews are outrageous for a dental office. I read they are not bbb accredited so maybe they feel complaints wont go anywhere but I know how I'm getting ready to handle my virus time off. Wish me good luck! Also noticed here, they only answer to positive post and I'm just wondering what city these positive post came from because there are over 500 bad complaints on a different site in los angeles<//text>

Hello My name:
Andrea Herrera,
I had a really good experience with Dr. Wu, at 1407 W. March Lane Stockton Ca. 95207.

My experience I got my X-ray, done also my two fillings, done in the front...Dr. Wu, was very professional he was patient, gentle, but most importantly...

Dr. Wu, made time also for my deep cleaning, with his helpful assistance.

Dr. Wu, assistant Ingria, was very nice and professional I felt comfortable.

Sincerely,

Patient: Andrea Herrera< /text>

Have Medical, called and scheduled a simple teeth cleaning. Again, low income. I was told that the Dr. may or may not clean my teeth, and that I needed an examination.  When they finished with the examination, they said I needed beyond a cleaning, and they handed me a bill for 4,700.  what the hell happened to me just getting what I could afford? I simply asked for a regular teeth cleaning.< /Text>

Western Dental is an overbooked, understaffed, poorly ran company from the dentist to the corporate offices. They will screw up your payments and attempt to pressure you into paying exorbitant fantasy late fees while with holding services. No one will return your phone calls and half the people are unqualified to work in the dental office. Secretaries prepping for dentist without washing their hands or wearing gloves. This is my 7th or 8th call to correct their screw ups!< /review>

Absolutely unprofessional, went in to have my wisdom teeth extracted, they over charged me $1100, had a meeting with my insurance brokers from work last week, spoke about what Western Dental charged me. My brokers reviewed my medical documents and found that they did indeed owe me, they used back office tactics to get me to agree to a 24 month plan, after my insurance reps contacted them, they informed the reps  they callwould call me immediately and credit me, but still have not called..
Wish I could give them no stars.< /text>

I'm only giving a one-star review because it's the lowest Google's got!

Currently, I have braces on that were applied by Western Dental. They'd sent me a letter in the mail informing me that they are choosing to no longer do business with me and they were terminating my contract with them. In the letter, it also stated that they were willing to take my braces off and would give me a retainer all for free, because if I kept them on, there was a high possibility that I would get cavities that would not be able to be taken care of until the braces are off.

Well, here is where my issue comes in. I'd called to schedule an appointment with them to have this taken care of. They'd informed me that I would need to pay $200 out of pocket to take them off. I'd mentioned the letter they sent me, but even with the letter, they'd refused to do the service for free as stated. I didn't end up making the appointment, because I didn't have $200 to just give away. So, by that point I was just willing to let it go. Unfortunately, now I've got several cavities beneath my braces that need to be taken care of.

I'd called an attorney, because I knew that them not taking me in initially, unless I agreed to pay that fee, was wrong. When I contacted my attorney, she told me to get a copy of the letter (I've yet to find my original). So, I called the corporate office and a woman named Sylvia was very snooty with me when speaking to her. I'd informed her that I would like a copy of the letter that was sent to me. She told me, "We are not obligated to resend the letter to you. Those letters are just a courtesy from us." I'd then asked to speak with a manager, but she refused and told me that she was the only one that was going to help me, and that if I wanted to have my lawyer contact them, she would have them transferred over to the legal department. She then hung up on me. I called back immediately (very angry at this point for what I'd experienced thus far) and a man answered this time. Once he heard who I was, he then hung up on me also. I called back a third time and Sylvia answered my call. I'd asked why she hung up on me, and she apologized and continued to yell and talk over me. I told her that she was being very unprofessional and giving me terrible customer service. She responded with, "This isn't the customer service department."

By that time I'd reminded her that my calls are recorded.

Now that I'm thinking about it, this is actually the same woman who gave me complications while I was pregnant with my son.

I knew that I wasn't going to get anywhere with her, and she wasn't going to let me speak with anyone else.

I submitted a complaint with the Dental Board for client negligence.

I'll need to call back to report Sylvia for the way she treated me as well as the other gentleman who hung up on me.<//text>

<text>>>EXTRA Zero star<< this place is totally scam, I will definitely sue this company. Hopefully we get ride of Western dental near soon because no one there is professional at all, they don't  care about your situation, they nicely respond to your reviews asking you to call them ! But, whenever you call customer service there is a rude lady who called Silvia doesn't care about your complain, she doesn't have any manners or sense of humor. Don't make a mistake and trust those scammers. All they care is to charge you as high as they possibly can.<//text>< Pics>

Just have to say many kudos to Shairoz who assisted Dr Gao with my son's root canal today 9/18/19 she is the most helpful and I was so impressed how she could work to help us and lots of other patients while it was a very busy day. I was well impressed by how she can handle such a busy environment and I am thankful for her because I knew she was to be off soon but she stayed to help out and put the customers first which is awesome of her Thank You< /Text>

<Text>Waited to be called for over 2 hours. Elderly patient. The excuse was that one out of 2 x-ray machines was broken, the specialist who visits once a month was there and those patients had priority over a new elderly patient. Although we arrived 30 minutes earlier than scheduled, specialty patients took priority even 2 hours after our arrival. Lousy, unprofessional service. So not recommended it.<//Text>< GmapID>

Dentist are not well enough trained . Looked at compliance element's.  Out of date signage posted indicating Dentist credentials.  Qualified dentist could not even give me the name of the metal they use for braces. Which I knew it is stainless steal.  On the form a parent fills out , there is no information regarding to the materials the use in the child's mouth while conducting the oral operations. Dr did not look over health history of patient. And still wanted to proceed moving forward with an operation that could of been very harmful to the patient or even fatal.
Classics and factorial case of malpractice.

I would like a response on what material this company uses when applying  braces in a patient's mouth.  What brand of metal this company supplies for braces and the origin from where it is made.

Even if this company choses not to give out this information,  a well composed discovery  team will deep dive and dig up any documents rrequires.
Dr did not even know about dental compliance required by the state along with federal guidelines.< /text>

Never go there! Ever, they rip you off. It takes almost a hour to get some one on the phone. Then they can't even help you. Say it's not their fault.I don't blame the person that I talked too. All I did was go in for a exam, ex ray, and a teeth. I was chard $1,222.40. Then I was told I needed a guard and chared me  more $745. I cancel the order about a hour later. I was told I needed my wisdom teeth  out. Then why would I needed a bit guard that would not fit after having my teeth out. It also took 8 times to do the impressions. The e ex rays took over a hour to do. I was lied too also. $ 425 for dental hygiene that they didn't do. Also, a hole bunch of other things that wasn't done. I told them I didn't want to watch the video. I was chared $38. I didn't even watch it.  Oh, also I was not aloud to see my e rays. I waned to see if all 4 teeth were in as bad shape. Full of decay. I would have like to see them. I have so much more to say. I'll stop here.</Review>

Hi my name is Jorge and  Western Dental from Perris CA did a horrible job they rush you in and out they half a** work on you way too many people being booked at once. Also there lazy office did not even attempt to bill my insurance company both my dental insurance companies said they never received any billing from Western dental and when I called there corporate they just give you the run around until they send you the collections and then they definitely don't care. Stay away from this horrible place they don't care about their patients< /text>

< Review>
The worst dental company EVER. I’ve been a customer since a little girl, (for 8 years). I put in a grievance with them because they were making me travel two hours just to get my retainers, and wouldn’t let me transfer to the one 3mins from my home, they made my retainers wrong, so when I came back to get them, they didn’t fit. My teeth were spacing out even more because I had to wait another two weeks. They basically said it was my fault and they wouldn’t provide the service to fix this problem without me basically paying for braces a 3rd time with them. I’m disgusted and am done with this company, I’m 24 but I’m going to get veneers instead. They don’t care about the customers and their corporate office is just as horrible as the service in the office. Save yourself the money and headache, after 8 years and about $10,000 of my own money, my teeth are reverting back once again. Absolutely horrible.< /Review>

<Review>I went to Western Dental for braces because I thought it would be cheaper but it wasn't even worth it. They told me at my consultation that I wouldn't have to pay any kind of interest with a $0 down payment and they also told me I didn't have to pull any additional teeth out to receive braces. Well I ended up paying a $250 down payment. After they placed the brackets in (without wire or spacers) the lady said I had to pull 4 of my teeth in addition to the wisdom teeth I already had taken out. I told them I didn't want to get extra teeth taken out so I told them to cancel my contract. Then they told he I owed $1700 just for placing brackets on. They didn't even place a wire or spacers yet just little metal brackets. So now I'm looking into a lawyer because I shouldn't have to pay $1700 for that little bit of metal. Now I'm looking into getting a lawyer. They were so unprofessional. They should have told me before they placed bracket on my teeth or I wouldn't have gotten the braces in the first place.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE!!

I did my invisalign here and after couple years and getting 3 sets in their irvine office I received an awful result with lots of headache each time I go there!!
This location used to be smile wide when I initially bought my package and they keep changing my dr and later they change the name to Western Dental and again keep changing my doctor.
Their doctors are unprofessional and careless, the only thing they care is money with poor service!
I paid approximately $6k for invisalign. After 3sets with this awful result they are saying oh you shouldn’t do invisalign and since you are not happy you can pay more and do orthodontic (its because their office is stop doing invisalign and they dont want to get responsibility of my result) which is absolutely rude.

I called them several times and they have never called me back. I also called to their cooperation office and talked with Cidney three weeks ago. She was super rude and hangs up phone on me, so I called back and their supervisor told me she will follow up with irvine office and asked their manager to call me which Ive never get a called back!!!

This is not the first time that I am being treated badly and keep giving letter to sign in case they dont get sue. After they got the total payment they started treating me a badly...

If I could them 0 I would definitely give them 0.<//review>

UPDATE TO MY REVIEW> WESTERN DENTAL IS BEING SUED and has "settled" out of court. YOU LOST, YOU ARE CRIMINALS. I have contacted the attorney general regarding Western Dental's criminal actions including harrassment, fraud (personal financial and insurance) and violation of the telephone consumers protection act.  I have involved the california dental board and the attorney generals office. Please contact me if you have been criminally violated by western dental within the past 2 years.<//Review>

<Review>I was under. Payment plan. When I went to complete what i was paying for I was told I had no insurance. Then I was told the dentist that was working on me no longer worked there. I was also rescheduled 7 separate times. Finally I called to stop payment and cancel contract. I was told I would be contacted in 30 days. The office that worked on me didn’t even have their records right about what to charge me. The whole job was suppose to be 1800 and they only completed half. The girl in charge of accounts had the nerve to say I still owed money after paying 1100 dollars. Now I just received a statement for plastic due on something that hasn’t happened. I hat this company. Everyone on the phones are a joke. They are a big rip off!!! Don’t go therr</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

I paid for all of his work before they started anything and now he has temperate crowns in for 3 months. He had an appointment for  tomorrow but now again the Dr is not going to be there.

<Time>1482364525061</Time><Rating>1< /Rating><review>Let me just say this is the first bad review I've ever made for any company.  I've never had such a bad experience worth my time posting.  But I have to say, Western Dental really just did it for me.  Never mind the bad experience with my braces treatment.  The reason I stopped going to my braces treatment was due to poor communication between staff and doctors that made it difficult to get anything done with my treatment.  As soon as I got those suckers off, I didn't even go to a follow up appointment.  As soon as I could I paid off my contract balance in September.  After many many phone calls and back in forth with customer service, billing, finance, collections. I found out the person who took my last payment failed to cancel auto pay.  In October, they took an unauthorized payment from my account.  When I called them, they said, they would credit my account with in 30 days(why it takes soo long, when it's not even my fault) who knows,  and cancel officially auto pay.  November comes along, they do refund my money, but guess what, they take it right back out with another unauthorized auto payment.  When I call, they say they will "cancel auto payment this time" and credit my account until December.  It's now Dec. 21 "over a month now" and no refund.  Thank goodness, someone manged to cancel autopay, but still I can't get anyone to refund my money for the Nov payment.  Customer service is horrible, it seems like no one knows how the system runs in their own corporate office.  I've never felt so much frustration.  It almost seems like they will never refund my money back.  By the way, I just saw just now, that they have 1.4 stars.  How do they even have almost 2 stars.< /review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Called to make an appointment for next day and I was told I needed to call tomorrow to see if a Dentist will be there although an appointment was available.Then they proceeded in telling me that I needed to call my insurance to see if they accept the dentist although they accept my PPO insurance. Wasted my time calling.< /text>

This company has been owing me a refund for over 8 months and I have yet to receive it. I have called the corporate office over ten times and no one has the sense to finally get this issue resolved. Don't trust western dental because they will definitely rip you off.<//review>

<Review>I am an ortho patient at the Alta Loma  Office. I'm totally disappointed with the services. I believe there a rip off scam . I only need my braces n for a year and was charge as if  was keeping them on for 3 years or more over $3100. No only  did they placed the fluoride on my teeth and turn them Yellow and there still yellow after being placed on there over 5 month ago after I was told it will only last 2 weeks. When I mentioned it to them they wanted me to pay over $100 to get them cleaned after it was there fought. I reach out to the corporate office and when they finally got back to me. all they said was there's nothing they could do. well there is something I can do. Then they have a doctor that does not have a clue what she doing my teeth only shifted a little that why I placed them back on . I had no gaps. now I have gaps my teeth and there crocked. I'm very upset I want the agreement cancel and a refund of the payment I provided. if not I filing a small claims in the small claim court. or I will get a lawyer it will be worth it.< /Review><Response>{'time': 1533578132150, 'text': 'Traci, thank you for reaching out to us and bringing this to our attention.

<text>THIS IS THE MOST UNPROFESSIONAL DENTAL COMPANY I HAVE EVER SEEN.  STAY AWAY!  My name is, Patrick Alexander, and I am a Life & Health Agent for Twin Insurance Services in Southern California.  I accompanied one of my clients to Western Dental to have some work done.  They wrote her a contract for the work to be done and she started making payments in excess of $2000.  When she went back to have the work done the contract they had was different than the contract I had.  We have been trying for over 2 months now to get her a refund with no assistance WHAT SO EVER!  I have never seen a medical practice like this one, it is truly heartbreaking to watch my client continue to suffer from much needed dental work yet the company won't refund her despite not having done any services.< /text><Time>1439921609635<//Time>< user_id>

<Text>First, this is not a complaint against the dentist or the clinical staff who I found to be very competent.  As for Western Dental's practices, this place is a SCAM!!!  I went to their Gilroy office for cleaning and a cavity and was told that I could not refuse the Gingival Irrigation which increased my cost from $187 to $585.  $49 per quad, twice...$392.00.
This is not true, nor ethical and per my insurance company not necessary.  Following up with complaint to the California Dental Board, although based on the nonchalant attitude when I called corporate to complain, this is not new to this company.  They were eager to cancel my follow up appointment without even asking why at the local office.< /Text>< Pics>

<text>I normally don't write reviews but the Western Dental I am  currently taking my son to has left me appalled. My son is receiving care at the branch in Compton on Long Beach blvd and the front office staff is horrendous . He has braces and it is so hard to get an appointment with the Orthodontist. His last appointment which was last week we waited 2 hours and 15 min  to be scene. I work in a doctors office so I understand that the staff can't control the doctors time but the staff was so rude when I asked " How much longer would it be ?" I mean I felt HORRIBLE after leaving the office that day. They were rude, standoffish,  and so unprofessional. Honestly, I've experienced this since my first appointment there. I feel like I made a bad choice while handling my son's healthcare. Also, at his last appointment I was notified he'll be under the care of a different Orthodontist who has a total different approach then the previous one. Which means more time on his current contract !!!!! I am so bothered by this office< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Date>1499814548846< /Date>< user>

Okay I went to my local Western Dental and was treated horribly!!!  First of all the receptionist in the ortho department  yelled across the room because my kids wanted to help fill out the paperwork they give you. I’m 40 years old with 6 kids. I’m blind as a bat..  I’ve always had help filing out them packets. Never had any problems. This 18/19 year old girl yells excuse me you need to fill that out yourself.. They can’t help you. When I look back at her, and asked why? She smart mouthed back because YOURRRR the PARENT!!

KEEP IN MIND THE LOBY WAS PACKED.  Embarrassed doesn’t begin to describe how I felt. So after about 10 mins or so I got one packed done, and she called up one child’s name... I got happy. She asked me if I’m done?  I replied, Ya with one, not both... She said. “ Well you can either hurry up and finish or  reschedule because the ortho stuff is getting ready to go home... I said what?? Then she continued to tell me to just come back in the following week because it give me time to finish the paperwork. Here my problem the time she’s saying staff is going home was the same time that my second child’s appointment was  schedule .. 4:30! Ummm how you figure that. Why are they sending me away when I have another appointment slot. Trying to act like I’m taking long to fill out paperwork. Sooo rude.

So I leave, then go home and call to get the gals name so I can talk with manager about this situation.. Wouldn’t you know the person who answered the phone acted stupid soon as they realized why I was calling and refused to give me anyone’s names.. oh, talk about playing games!! A bunch of adults going to a training school for a year and half and no one can teach then a little class.

As a local business owner I can tell you that that no way to treat people. I had to call corporate. I don’t know if it helped, however the reviews speak for themself. It’s to bad that they are about the only option many people have who need to make payments. I can tell you have six kids this is the only reason I am forced to keep going back. Maybe the bad reviews will help them improve things. Train their workers or start to let go staff who mistreat and act disrespectful toward patient..</text>

< review>
This was by far the worst experience I have ever had at any type of medical/dental facility....
I was seen fairly quickly, the dentist and assistant were decent, but while I was lying in the exam chair (in excruciating pain from an exposed nerve in my tooth)
This receptionist kept coming back to get my credit card to pay for my tooth extraction.
 The first time she made a mistake and overcharged  me for unwanted products I explained I didn't want. She again took my card to void out the first charge of $84.70
 She Charged my card a second time for the corrected amount of $59.70.
 She returned a third time to inform me I still owed the office approximately $10.
I instructed her to use my card. She replied to me that my card was declined for insufficient funds.(I'm starting to panic)
 I asked why the voided sale amount from the first charge wasn't on my card?( By now I'm numb but really confused )  She told me a voided sale amount wasn't going to be back on my card for 24 hours.
 I explained to her the funds on my card ( which was plenty to cover my $59.70 copay) was all the money I had until my payday. She suggested I set up an autopay contract to deduct the money from my card the following day when she informed me that the voided sale amount would be back on my card. I am hurting, my numbing medicine is wearing off, and she brings me 3-4 receipts to sign.
This receptionist comes to me again shortly after my tooth was extracted to tell me the office wasn't going to charge me the $10 balance I owed (for her damn mistake) and gave me a copy of the voided sale receipt and the final sale receipt along with a copy of the service I received. AGAIN SHE INFORMED ME MY VOIDED SALE AMOUNT WOULD BE BACK ON MY CARD 24 HOURS FROM THEN!
Needless to say, the voided sale amount WAS NOT ON MY CARD 24 HOURS LATER!!! It took me 4 days of calling to Western Dental Corporate Office, being transferred to countless phone operators who claim they only know how to make appointments!  (Beyond Madening)
I finally found out from a supervisor I demanded to speak to that there will be an audit report done and a refund process began that will take 15-40 business days to know where my money went and when it will be returned to me. (Seriously )
Very unprofessional and the receptionist should NOT be allowed to ask  people for credit cards while they are incapacitated and in excruciating pain.

My advice to you is :
TAKE CASH WITH YOU TO PAY FOR SERVICES RENDERED!!
NEVER GIVE YOUR CARD TO A RECEPTIONIST TO SWIPE FOR PAYMENT IF YOU AREN'T DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THEM!
A $60 dentist bill ended up costing me $140 that day
I still haven't heard back from the corporate office about my refund.

I know I will NEVER make that mistake again, sadly you don't expect something like this to happen from your dentist.<//review>

<review>I don't want referral no one. Worse worse service. Bad experience. You loose you time and money. I done my bridge and crown. Over $8500.00.  I have issue. Crawn look like crack when they made add top porcelain. I ask why is that? They said it is teeth shape?????. I never saw that tipe teeth shape. 3-4 times they chance crown, bridge. Look like unprofessional made in lab.  All bridge and crown worse. I am very sad.  I go end of the January Santa Ana office I wait one hour.  After one doctor come she  tell me I am not you doctor.

I can truthfully say I regret all business I ever did with this company. Especially the staff at the clinics, my god, what a nightmare. HOW DO YOU ALLOW SOMEONE TO SIGN UP FOR AUTO-PAY AND NOT EVER SEND THEM A RECIEPT OR A STATEMENT?! Everything about this company is garbage. Its my own fault for not listening to the reviews.
When I reached out to ask for a statement, they said they would send me a "courtesy" one. Like they're doing me a favor for paying them . Ugh!!!<//review>

I have not enough words to describe how absolutely horrible this entire Corporation is. Greedy, liars, thieves, employees who can not even speak without grammatical errors. This is truly an out rage. Taking money, making up new contracts once one is already in place, changing prices along the way, loosing payments, claiming not to have received payments, tacking on more to pay at the end. Taking one to collection because your contract was finished PAID off 100% and then they decide to add on another $900 more to an additional contract that was never even drawn up till the end of the service. This is corrupt beyond corrupt. I would take down each one of those mo fo's if even given a chance.< /text>

My 8 yr old was referred from tr Vista office to see a specialist at the Venice & Western office. First of all it looks horrible and dirty from the outside , even my son had a comment about way the building looks. Then when we got inside and checked in, the staff could not find his paperwork from the other office, then we waited for an hour , when we finally got called in, they had the wrong X-ray and then they displayed someone else X-ray on the screen. finally after all that was figured out the Dentist Dr Knapp was extremely rude and did not want to discuss anything with me , she tried to kick me out of the room. Then she walked my son to another room and wanted to strap him down and did not want me anywhere in sight, after fussing at her she refused to see him. VERY Rude and she has a short temper as if she is on the verge of a break down  when a parent has questions for her.<//text>

WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!!  TIMELINE:
1st visit 1989 and many visits since
1989- had major work in Western Dental Hawthorne Blvd, Lawndale, CA
1992 to 1999 numerous minor visits
2001-2002- visits for after assault work
March 2012- spent $6,000 over what my insurance crowns, root canals
May-June 2015- had more work done approx. $2k. Left being told paid up
October/November 2016- pain from non cavity hole in tooth. before they
just puts drops said nothing can be done
November/December 2016 made appointment. Went in told cannot see
me I was in collections-would not tell me what for or how much. Made
me look like a fool in front of at least 10-15 customers.Later I
contacted support says cannot tell me what collection was for-I said I
am the patient. After 5 people I ended up with Argon collection agency
who would not tell me anything, just said give me a credit card or I will
ruin your credit, which they had already done . My FICA went from 805
to 699. I contested with all Credit agencies and won. Come to find out
they  filed incorrectly to insurance company, so $700.00 not paid. they
were sending bill to wrong Address. I have statement from person
who received my bills and returned. I had to pay almost 900.00 on
December 11, 2016 to clear.
March 22, 2017- I called to make appointment as the pain has become
unbearable, 4 people told me I was in collections even though I paid
back in December. Person #5 at Western Dental corporate offices- "Oh
I see you already paid. Someone forgot to un-flag you". I said sho do I
complain to  about all this mess. It is all you guy's fault. Oh let me
transfer you- after 30 minutes i hung up
March 17, 2017- later that day. I called and was on a phone with operator
at Western Dental for about 20 minutes. She called the Office I was to
go to to see if they  would see me with no problem now. She came back
and said yes they will see you, no problem. So I go at 3PM. Again in
front of no less than 10 people they embarrass me by telling me loudly
you cannot be seen you are in collections.
that is it I am done, I will make sure I post this same complaint on Twitter,
Linkedin, facebook(numerous pages) as well as any other site that will let me post. I am also going to send our local news stations with watchdog reporting this story as well as a letter to the editor in the local newspaper.

it may not be much, but if I can save a few people the agony Western Dental gave me- the better I will feel!!
IT WAS MARCH 22 NOT MARCH 17TH LATER THAT DAY WHEN I WAS TOLD I COULD GO IN, SORRY FOR THE CONFUSION< /text>

<username>Justina Jinzo<//username><Date>1470950012540< /Date><rate>1<//rate><text>(((ZERO STARS))) I came to western dental  6 months pregnant with a broken molar. they charged me so much to fix it and i was not in the mood to wait around until the baby was born. when i went to get my replacement crown they could not find it.... i had to go back and have a new model of my teeth re done sooooo annoying... so finally went back and had it done. once it was done i noticed that they tooth was not along the gum line there was too much space between the tooth and the gum line. i asked and they said that i needed to give it time so my gums will get used to the false tooth being there... anyhow time passed and 3 yrs later i wake up and my face was the size of a beach ball the tooth was infected. bacteria and food had gotten into the tooth because of the space between the tooth and gum line. (((WORST PAIN EVER!!!)))  I had to miss work and have a retreatment on the tooth and pay another 3 grand AT THAT POINT I WENT TO ANOTHER DENTIST WAS NOT GOING TO RISK DEALING WITH THE BS... now im stuck with WD on my credit for a shotty job... DO NOT GO HERE.!!!!

THEN HERES THE ICING ON THE CAKE I HAVE 2 DIFFERENT BALANCES ONE FROM WD AND ONE FROM A COLLECTION COMPANY ON MY CREDIT REPORT AND NEITHER SAY THAT THEY CAN TAKE ONE OFF... WTH IS UP WITH THAT??</text>< pics>

(Translated by Google) Every time someone speaks to make an appointment they take more than 20 minutes reviewing your entire history. If you are already a patient, I don't see why you have to give all your information and ask for only the basics. They could be more direct and just schedule the appointment!

(Translated by Google) I had an appointment, they gave me a credit card and they gave me the bill, they took out two teeth in a few days, they gave me the tooth, everything was alive until I got the tooth, they gave me an appointment, I went at 8am when the dentist saw the tooth, he said that it was not permanent, in addition to his very dirty robes, the Dr had a nail full of fungus, it gave me disgust and if I want a permanent tooth, it is the same total 5,000 dollars for a tooth because I have never heard two bad bones and faces here in pittsburg and That is not all, they injected me with an anesthetic that gave me a cold and it was hot time until my contract form, I have to see how I jumped from cold and lasted until 11 at night that intense cold in the heat of the that day
and they say that they planted me 2 little bones of 400.00 dlrs each, I think they are lies, nor did the wound hurt me.

(Original)
tuve una cita me dieron crédito Card y lla que firme me dieron la cuenta me sacaron dos dientes en unos días me dieron el diente todo viva bien hasta que se kebro el diente me dieron una cita fui a las 8am cuando vio el dentista el diente dijo que no era permanente además sus batas bien sucias el Dr tenía una uña llena de fungus me dio asco y si quiero diente permanente es otro tanto total 5.000 dlrs por un diente porque eso que dos huesitos nunca lo e oído malos y caretos aquí en pittsburg y eso no es todo me inyectaron una anestesia que me dio un frío y era tiempo de calor asta en mi forma de contrato se a de ver como brincaba yo de frío y me duró asta las 11 de la noche ese frío intenso enmedio del calor que había ese dia
y disen que me plantaron 2 huesitos de 400.00 dlrs cada uno creo que son mentiras ni morado se me puso la herida.< /Text>
